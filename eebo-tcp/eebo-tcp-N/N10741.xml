            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THE enſuing diſcourſe was delivered on a very ſolemn occaſion, before an auditory apparently ſerious and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout in their attention; and is now made public at the deſire of ſome of my public ſpirited friends. Such as it is, I cheerfully offer it as my <hi>poor mite,</hi> into the public trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury; while others are caſting in of their abundance. And I hope and truſt that your candor will be ſuch, amidſt all the inaccuracies and imperfections that attend ſuch an haſty compoſition, as to accept it for a real token and proof of my undiſſembled love and heart-felt concern for my dear country, under the dark and threatning aſpects of divine providence on our moſt invaluable liberties and privileges. While I obſerve with the moſt ſenſible grief, and anxious concern, ſome of my countrymen, ſunk into a ſtate of worſe than brutal ſtupidity and inſenſibility, who ſecretly rejoice in the diſtreſſing miſeries and calamities brought on our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering brethren at <hi>Boſton;</hi> and ardently wiſh and pray, <hi>in the moſt profane manner,</hi> if I may be allowed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, that our charter and birth right privileges may be taken from us; that we may be ruled by the iron rod of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, and chained down to eternal ſlavery and bondage.

Whoſe factious and rebellious leaders improve every oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity in their power, to impeach a loyal people; and to ſend miſrepreſentations of us to their correſpondents that have ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the Britiſh court, to haſten our intended ruin and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction. I ſay, while theſe clandeſtine, miſchievous opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are carrying on againſt us, as black and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>s the powder-treaſon plot; it revives my ſoul, and rejoices my heart to find that the main body of the people, or at leaſt, the moſt ſenſible and judicious part of them, are in ſome de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, awakened by the loud thunders in Providence, and have their eyes opened to the danger and ruin we are threatened with; that they are ſo far raiſed above that infam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>s herd of vile miſcreants, as to know that they are men, and have the ſpirits of men; and not an inferior ſpecies of animals, made to be beaſts of burden to a lawleſs, corrupt adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This manly, this heroic, and truly patriotic ſpirit, which is gradually kindling up in every free-man's breaſt, through the continent, is undoubtedly a token for good; and will, if duly regulated by Chriſtian principles and rules, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſucceſs to American liberty and freedom. No free ſtate was ever yet enſlaved and brought into bondage, where the people were inceſſantly vigilant and watchful; and inſtantly took the alarm at the firſt addition made to the power ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed over them.—They are thoſe only of the tribes of <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachar,</hi> who keep in profound ſleep; and like ſtrong and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid <hi>aſſes,</hi> couch down between heavy burdens; that inſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſink into abject ſlavery and bondage. It is a duty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumbent upon us at all times, to keep a watchful attention to our intereſts; (eſpecially in ſeaſons of peril and danger,) to watch and pray that we fall not.</p>
            <p>I do not mean to encourage evil jealouſies and groundleſs ſuſpicions of our civil rulers, the guardians of our liberties; nor to countenance ſeditious tumults in the ſtate, ſo deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to our civil happineſs and peace. I am a firm friend to good order and regularity; that all ranks of men move in ſtrait lines, and within their own proper ſpheres: That au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and government be ſupported and maintained ſo as
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:013614_0005_0F905B4295620B78"/>
to promote the good of ſociety, the end for which it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted; perfectly conſiſtent with which, a people may keep a watchful eye over their liberties, and cautiouſly guard againſt oppreſſion and tyranny, which I deteſt and abhor, and <hi>ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnly abjure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you, <hi>Gentlemen Freemen,</hi> have been ſo well in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doctrinated in the principles of loyalty and good policy, have been ſo conſtantly taught from your infancy, to fear God, and honor the King, that 'tis needleſs to add any particular inſtructions on this head. However, as my heart, at this threatning period, is ſo full of apprehenſion of danger, you will not, I truſt, take it as any reflection on your under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and integrity as a body, ſhould I drop the hint, that there may poſſibly be ſome <hi>here</hi> and <hi>there</hi> in diſguiſe, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt whoſe plauſible pretences, and artful inſinuations, it might be well for you to guard. <hi>Men,</hi> (ſays the truly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious and patriotic Farmer, in Pennſylvania,) <hi>who either hold or expect to hold certain advantages by ſetting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of ſervility to their countrymen; men, who trained to the employment, or ſelf-taught by a natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral verſality of genius; ſerve as decoys, for drawing the innocent and unwary, into ſnares; it is not to be doubted but that ſuch men will diligently beſtir them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves on this, and every like occaſion, to ſpread the infection of their meanneſs as far as they can. On the plans they have adopted, this is their courſe; this is their method to recommend themſelves to their patron: they act conſiſtently in a bad cauſe.—From them we ſhall learn how pleaſant and profitable a thing it is, to be, for our ſubmiſſive behaviour, well-ſpoken of at St.</hi> James<hi>'s, or St.</hi> Stephen<hi>'s, at</hi> Guild-hall, <hi>or the</hi> Royal-exchange. <hi>Specious fallacies will then be dreſt up with all the arts of deluſion, to perſuade one co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony to diſtinguiſh herſelf from another by unbecom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing condeſcentions, which will ſerve the ambitious purpoſes of great men at home; the way to obtain conſiderable rewards.—It will be inſinuated to us with
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:013614_0006_0F905B4367ACC0E8"/>
a plauſible affectation of wiſdom and concern, How prudent it is to pleaſe the powerful—How dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous to provoke them.—And then comes in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual incantation that freezes up every generous pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of the ſoul, in cold inactive expectation, that if there is any requeſt to be made, compliance will obtain favourable attention.—Our</hi> vigilance, <hi>and our</hi> union <hi>are ſucceſs and ſafety.—Our negligence and our diviſion are diſtreſs and death; nay, worſe, they are</hi> ſhame <hi>and</hi> ſlavery. <hi>The perſons here meant,</hi> (ſays the aboveſaid Gentleman) <hi>are thoſe baſe ſpirited wretches, who may endeavour to diſtinguiſh themſelves by their ſordid zeal in defending and promoting meaſures which they know, beyond all queſtion, to be deſtructive to the juſt rights and true intereſts of their country.

            </p>
            <p>Some of a narrow contracted turn of mind may think that by this quotation, and ſome other expreſſions I have uſed, I aim to point out perſons of a certain religious profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as objects of public odium and contempt. To which I anſwer, no further than their temper and conduct render them worthy of it. I do not think that piety, public virtue, and a love to one's country, are entailed to, or inſeperably connected with any one mode of profeſſing chriſtianity; how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſome may have the advantage of others, in their tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to promote theſe chriſtian and political virtues; yet I believe there may be mean, baſe and mercenary wretches in every profeſſion, who for one ſweet delicious morſel to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, might be tempted to ſell their country with all its liberties and privileges, as profane <hi>Eſau</hi> ſold his birth-right. On the other hand, I believe there are many good men, of ſound integrity, of unblemiſhed morals, and truly lovers of their country in every denomination of chriſtians. On this ſubject, it matters not with me, whether a man be

            <p>GOD the ſovereign Lord and ſupreme Ruler of all things, has made men in ſuch a manner, and placed them in ſuch circumſtances, as plainly to diſcover his will, that they ſhould unite and combine into ſocieties for their mutual benefit and advantage. He has not, by the light of nature, nor by any poſitive declarations of his will, infallibly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected what form of ſociety he would have to prevail, nor preſcribed any one particular ſpecies of civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as more agreeable to him, than another. But has made mankind rational creatures; and left them to chooſe that which they apprehend to be moſt perfect in its nature and kind, and beſt ſuited to their ſtate, ſituation and circumſtances. The divine con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and government of God over his intelligent creatures, is fixed; and it does not become men to exerciſe their invention or wiſdom in ſeeking any alte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration or change in it: but to ſtudy the moſt ready and cheerful ſubmiſſion; as they may be aſſured, that whatever God requires, is fit and right for his ſubjects to comply with. His authority and power over us is unlimited and uncontrolable, and cannot be denied, or oppoſed without our being guilty of the higheſt crime of rebellion. But no created being is inveſted with ſuch abſolute, unlimited power, nor qualified for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe

of it. Error and imperfection belongs to every individual of the human race. The brighteſt charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that was ever juſtly drawn among mortal men, has this dark ſhade in it: So that the will of none, is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallibly right in all things, and cannot therefore be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with in all inſtances, conſiſtent with a good conſcience, and the ſuperior obligations we are under to the ſovereign Ruler of the world; who ſtill main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains his rightful authority over us, and has not given it by delegation, to any one among created beings: all of whom were originally made free-agents; and conſidered as in a ſtate of nature, previous to their uniting as members of ſociety, have their liberty and free choice to agree upon ſuch a form of government, and mode of adminiſtration in their civil and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral affairs, as they judge moſt conducive to their hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and good: any one of which has no more claim than another to be, <hi>jure divino,</hi> or of divine right, on any other principle, than its being more conformable to right reaſon and equity, by the eternal rules of which, God has manifeſted it to be his will, that his rational creatures be governed.</p>
            <p>As ſocieties and communities have their beginning and origin in voluntary compact and agreement; when perſons have entered by conſent and free choice, into ſociety, they muſt acknowledge themſelves under ſtrict and ſacred obligations to act toward one another a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the laws and conſtitution of that ſociety whereof they are members. There are certain duties required of rulers, as well as of ſubjects; and their obligations faithfully and punctually to fulfil them, riſe in proportion to the dignity and importance of their high and elevated ſtations; and the effect and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence which their conduct has on the reſt of the body. A man's being raiſed to honour and promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion above others, is ſo far from releaſing him from, or leſſening his duty, that every ſtep he takes in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

new and powerful obligation to the performance of it. The moſt abſolute of ſovereign princes owe ſomething to the meaneſt of their ſubjects; and may be very criminal in the neglect or refuſal of it. Subjects have rights, privileges and properties; and are countenanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſupported by the law of nature, the laws of ſociety, and the law of God; in demanding full pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection in the enjoyment of theſe rights, and the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial diſtribution of juſtice, from their rulers. And when rulers refuſe theſe, and will not comply with ſuch a reaſonable and equitable demand from the ſubject; the ſociety is diſſolved; and its fundamental laws violated and broken; and the relation between the ruler and the ſubject ceaſes, with all the duties and obligations that aroſe from it. For it muſt be ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and every one of common ſenſe will readily allow, that no man would ever have conſented to place him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in the ſtate of a ſubject, on any other conſiderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or footing than that of his having protection and juſtice from thoſe to whom he ſubmitted. The good of ſociety in all its individual members, is the end for which it is formed; and for which government is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted and appointed. And this cannot be obtained, unleſs rulers exert their power, influence and authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to protect their ſubjects in all their valuable rights and privileges; defend them againſt their enemies, both from without, and within; and adminiſter im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial juſtice among them. <hi>David,</hi> who had, for many years, exerciſed an abſolute ſovereignty and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion over the kingdom of Iſrael, had no notion of aggrandizing himſelf, and his nobility, by enſlaving his ſubjects, and ſtriping them of their property, at his own arbitrary will and pleaſure, contrary to <hi>law</hi> and <hi>right</hi>: but conſiders himſelf as appointed to ſerve them, whoſe rights and privileges were eſteemed by him, more ſacred and inviolable than thoſe of the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

himſelf the faithful ſervant of God, and his generation. His ambition and deſire was to ſerve his generation; not to be ſerved by them in the character of abject vaſſals and ſlaves. A king or prince of his noble and heroic ſpirit could have no pleaſure or ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in ruling over their fellow-mortals, degrad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſuch a low, infamous ſtate, ſo far beneath hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. But to rule over men that have the ſpirit of men, the ſpirit of loyalty and liberty; and who poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs ſome property too; is an honour to the moſt dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified king or prince. And the more of this ſpirit of liberty, in conjunction with property among the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the greater is the honour of him that ſways the ſcepter in righteouſneſs over them. This Jewiſh, or Iſraelitiſh prince was very ſenſible, that kings and rulers were liable to do wrong, unjuſt actions, as well as others; that the ſubjects had rights and properties that might be invaded or encroached upon by them. We therefore find among his laſt words, the excellent ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence now read, which he ſpake juſt as he was leaving his earthly throne and kingdom, and going to appear before a higher tribunal.—<hi>He that ruleth over men muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God. David</hi> himſelf had been a ruler over men: he was the man who was raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up on high; the anointed of the God of <hi>Jacob,</hi>— muſt therefore, from his own great experience and obſervation, be ſuppoſed to have a thorough know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and underſtanding of the ſubject on which he here ſpeaks with ſo much ſeriouſneſs and ſolemnity, as in the near view of eternity, which conſideration adds weight and importance to his expreſſions; and might be ſufficient to engage the attention of the moſt dignified rulers, and ſovereign princes, to them; who muſt be inexcuſable if they refuſe to receive instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on from them, ſince a greater than <hi>David</hi> is here: <hi>The God of Iſrael has ſaid, the Rock of Iſrael has ſpoken.</hi> That glorious Being by whom kings reign, and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces decree juſtice, is the author of this divine ſentence
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013614_0013_0F905B4ADFADF470"/>
here given forth: to whom ſovereign rulers are as ſtrictly accountable for all their conduct, as the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of their ſubjects—May therefore properly be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led upon, and that, by the authority of the great Lord and governor of the world, to attend to, and conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entiouſly practice their duty in ſuch plain, important inſtances of it. <hi>Be wiſe now therefore O ye kings,</hi> ſays God, <hi>be inſtructed ye judges of the earth; ſerve the Lord with fear, rejoice with trembling.</hi> Pſal. ii.10, 11.</p>
            <p>In further diſcourſing from theſe words, I ſhall,</p>
            <p n="1">I. Conſider the neceſſity and importance of juſtice in civil rulers.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Shew that the fear of the Lord is the proper, effectual principle, to influence ſuch to the obſervation and practice of juſtice.</p>
            <p n="1">I. 'Tis highly neceſſary and important, that civil rulers ſhould be juſt. Such are concerned in the rules of juſtice and righteouſneſs, as well as other men; and indeed, more ſo, in proportion as they are raiſed above others; and have it in their power to do greater good or evil, according as they are inclined. Was the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine true, <hi>That all property is veſted in the king, or chief rulers; and that they can do no wrong to their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects:</hi> Such ſcripture precepts and directions from the ſovereign Ruler of the world as that in my text, would be entirely needleſs and impertinent; and ſeem, on this ſuppoſition, to argue his want of wiſdom and knowledge, on this important ſubject. But however bold ſome conceited, ambitious mortals may be, in cenſuring others, when advanced a little above them in wealth and power; yet, I would hope that few or none will dare openly to attack divine revelation, and cenſure the ruling wiſdom of God. <hi>Let God be true, tho' every man be found a liar. Let God be wiſe, tho' every man be found a fool.</hi> If thoſe that rule over men, muſt be juſt; there is certainly ſome rule of juſtice and righteouſneſs for them to obſerve in this office and character: and it may be infered by juſt conſequence,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013614_0014_0F905B4C356D4AB8"/>
               <hi>That they are capable of doing wrong</hi>; and as liable ſo to do as other men,—That thoſe who ſtand related to them as ſubjects, have really ſomething to call their own,—that they have rights and properties diſtinct from their ſovereign,—are capable of ſuffering injuſtice, oppreſſion and wrong, even from them; and that, in a greater degree than from any of their fellow-ſubjects, in proportion to the greater degree of their ſtrength and power. The aforeſaid doctrine therefore, advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſome, <hi>That kings and ſovereign rulers with their miniſtry, can do no wrong,</hi> is ſo far from being true, that it is the moſt falſe, abſurd doctrine that was ever preached in the world; and of moſt pernicious bad conſequence both to ruler and ruled, directly tending not only to the temporal, but eternal deſtruction of both. As rulers are capable, when they rightly improve the ſuperiour advantages of their high and elevated ſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, of doing more towards promoting juſtice and righteouſneſs among their fellow-men: ſo, when of a contrary temper and diſpoſition, that it to ſay, when they neglect, and refuſe to attend to thoſe good laws and rules of equity; and take it into their heads to act in an arbitrary, tyrannical manner, to oppreſs and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlave their ſubjects; they do the higheſt injuſtice and wrong, and the greatest miſchief and evil of any men in the world; and are the biggeſt plagues, and heavieſt judgments upon a ſociety that can be ſent upon them.</p>
            <q>Corruptio optimi eſt peſſima.</q>
            <p>None therefore that are promoted to the office and character of civil rulers, ought to think themſelves above the obſervation of the eternal rules of juſtice and righteouſneſs, by which they themſelves, as well as their ſubjects, will be tried hereafter, and juſtified or condemned by the righteous judge of the world.</p>
            <p>BUT that I may, to better advantage, illuſtrate the great neceſſity and importance of juſtice in civil rulers, I ſhall briefly conſider them in their ſeveral capacities, and ſhew the neceſſity of their being juſt, while acting in them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:013614_0015_0F905B4D986E2680"/>Now, under the name of rulers, are comprehended; both thoſe who enact laws, and thoſe who execute them; thoſe who are cloathed with legiſlative autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and thoſe who have that which is judicial and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial.</p>
            <p>WHEN men firſt joined in ſociety, 'twas impoſſible for them to form at once, a complete, perfect ſyſtem of laws, to ſuit all exigences, and particular caſes that might happen: they could not foreſee all future events, and make proviſion for them. The body politic, is like the natural body; ſubject to a variety of diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers and diſeaſes,—'tis ſometimes ſtrong, healthy and vigorous, and every part performs its proper office and function, without impediment or obſtruction:—At o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times, it declines, grows weak and relaxed in all its nervous parts; and to uſe the ſignificant and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful language of inſpiration, <hi>The whole head is ſick, and the whole heart faint; from the ſole of the foot, even unto the head, there is no ſoundneſs in it.</hi> And as it is liable to be thus ſickly and diſtempered; ſo 'tis liable to be diſſolved and die.</p>
            <p>NOW, as a man finds it neceſſary to regulate himſelf in regard to diet, exerciſe, phyſic, &amp;c. and ſuit his way of living to the preſent condition of his body, as will beſt ſerve to promote the health and activity of all the members of it; ſo there is the neceſſity of the like wiſe, prudential methods of adminiſtration in government, ſuited to the different ſtate and circumſtances<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> of the body politic. And as circumſtances vary, and new and different ſcenes open to view; new laws become neceſſary for the health and benefit of the community. All governments have therefore a legiſlative authority lodged in ſome hand or other; not to be exerciſed at the arbitrary will and pleaſure of one or more indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals; but in the exerciſe of it to be reſtrained and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited, at leaſt by the eternal rules of juſtice and righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013614_0016_0F905B4DD7166A68"/>
it is neceſſary for the well-being of ſociety, that good laws be made; ſo 'tis likewiſe neceſſary that they be duly put in execution; and that, both in civil and criminal caſes: this being the life of the law, without which it ſignifies nothing toward anſwering the end for which it was made. Now, in order to this, ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons muſt have authority to judge between a man and his neighbour, and to put their judgments in execution.</p>
            <p>THUS rulers conſidered either in their legiſlative or executive capacity, are deſigned for the general and public good of the community they ſerve; they are the miniſters of God, inſtituted and ordained to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend continually unto this very thing; and in both theſe capacities, they muſt be juſt. Particularly,</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is juſtice to be obſerved in making laws. The legiſlative authority is uſually ſtiled ſupreme. The power of making laws is undoubtedly the higheſt in every ſociety. The executive officers are obliged to obſerve the rule preſcribed them by the legiſlators; and all the ſubjects of every order, to yield obedience to their laws; provided they are not prejudicial to, but ſalutary and for the good of ſociety; and do not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfere with the duty they owe to the great Sovereign of all men; and do not contradict the end for which men unite, as members of ſociety; nor run counter to the fundamental conſtitution on which they are ſettled. While a ſociety ſubſiſts, no man, or number of men, have authority to call to account thoſe who are veſted with ſupreme authority: which makes it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely difficult to correct diſorders in a ſtate, when the foundations are out of courſe. But tho' ſovereign rulers cannot, while they continue in their high office and character, be called to account, b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> any under them; yet 'tis poſſible for them, by acting contrary to the deſign and intention of their office, to diſſolve the ſociety over which they rule; and ſo, at once loſe all their ſovereign power and authority: after which, they can have no more than other men, to ſcreen them from
<pb n="19"
                   facs="unknown:013614_0017_0F905B4E985ADD00"

ſuch puniſhment as their crimes deſerve. And when ſuch a melancholy event takes place, that a civil ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety is diſſolved, and men return to a ſtate of nature; They have the ſame liberty they at firſt had, to form themſelves into ſociety again, in what form, and on what terms they pleaſe.</p>
            <p>BUT notwithſtanding the ſovereignty of legiſlators, they are under ſtrict and ſacred obligations to obſerve the rule of juſtice, in enacting laws. 'Tis a great and very dangerous miſtake to ſuppoſe, that legiſlators have a power abſolutely arbitrary; or that their authority is under no limitation or reſtraint at all. Right and wrong, are founded in the nature of things; and cannot be altered and changed, even by the voice of ſuch kings and monarchs as are betruſted with the power of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing laws. The Pſalmiſt mentions, <hi>A throne of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity which frameth miſchief by a law.</hi> And if he had not mentioned ſuch a thing, any perſon of common ſenſe and underſtanding, who conſidered things with the leaſt degree of attention, would ſoon be convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that 'twas in the nature of things, poſſible to eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſh iniquity by a law. And any one who is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the hiſtory of former ages; or even with the preſent ſtate of the world, cannot but know, that this has in fact, been often done. No intelligent friends to the chriſtian inſtitution doubts, but the laws made by the heathen emperors for extirpating chriſtianity, and deſtroying the profeſſors of it, were unjuſt. All ſound proteſtants, I ſuppoſe, will agree in paſſing the ſame ſentence on the laws which eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh an <hi>inquiſition</hi> in ſome popiſh countries. And it muſt be a pleaſure to all lovers of liberty and virtue, to obſerve, that the number of thoſe who wiſh that no penal laws might be enacted in matters merely religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous,—that no perſon might be liable to any penalty, or lie under any incapacity, on account of any opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or practice in religion, which does not at all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ffect the peace and happineſs of human ſociety, is daily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:013614_0018_0F905B4F583E8B00"/>NOW, if there be any ſuch thing as acting unjuſtly in making a law, 'tis plain that rulers, conſidered in their legiſlative capacity, are obliged to obſerve ſome rule of juſtice. For where there is no duty or obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this ſort, there can be no ſuch thing as acting unjuſtly.</p>
            <p>'TIS a part of juſtice in legiſlators to enact ſuch laws as are ſuited to the circumſtances of the ſociety for the regulation of which they are intended: ſuch as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to the public good:—And ſuch as, inſtead of deſtroying, will ſecure and protect the juſt rights and privileges of every individual member:—ſuch as will, in an equitable manner, decide controverſies between particular ſubjects; and defend the weak, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent their becoming an eaſy prey to the ſtrong:—ſuch finally, as may be a terror to evil doers, and an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to thoſe that do well.</p>
            <p>THERE is further, juſtice to be obſerved between the community and particular perſons; under which head, are to be reckoned the granting proper rewards to thoſe who faithfully ſerve the public in any capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city: paying public debts: and ſacredly obſerving the public faith. Here likewiſe may be mentioned the penalties annexed to laws. Penal laws are intended for the public good: The great intention of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the tranſgreſſors of them is, that others may be kept in awe. And legiſlators have a right to annex ſuch penalties to their juſt and equitable laws, as are ſufficient to maintain their authority, and ſecure the obſervation of them. But yet, there is juſtice to be obſerved in proportioning puniſhments to crimes: and no doubt, it would be unjuſt, cruel and barbarous, to affix the moſt ſevere puniſhments that could be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, to ſmall and trifling offences.</p>
            <p n="2">2. RULERS conſidered in their executive capacity, as putting laws in execution, muſt be juſt. Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive officers are obliged to proceed according to the received and eſtabliſhed laws of their country. By

theſe, they are to judge and determine all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, both of a civil and criminal natue, which come before them; doing ſtrict, impartial juſtice to all men, without reſpect of perſons. Their duty is not to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs: but to deliver the poor that cry to them; the fatherleſs, and him that hath none to help. They ought to endeavour that the bleſſing, not the curſe of him that is ready to periſh, may come upon them: and to cauſe the widow's heart to ſing for joy. It concerns them to put on righteouſneſs, and to clothe themſelves with judgment, as with a robe and diadem. They muſt be eyes to the blind, and feet to the lame, and fathers to the poor; and the cauſe which they know not, ought to be ſearched out. To them it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longs to break the jaws of the wicked; and to pluck the ſpoil out of his teeth; to curb and reſtrain the violent; and let the oppreſſed go free. But it being ſo evident, and univerſally acknowledged, that thoſe who put the laws in execution, ought to be juſt men, I ſhall not enlarge upon this head: but proceed briefly to ſhow the neceſſity and importance of rulers being juſt; or to mention ſome of the obligations they are under to this great duty. And here,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THIS is neceſſary to their anſwering the deſign of their office, and promoting the welfare and good of human ſociety. Public good is the end of government of every ſort. 'Tis with a view of promoting and ſecuring this, that men enter into ſociety. 'Tis for obtaining this, that ſome are appointed to rule over others; and that thoſe ſubmit to, and obey them. Now, this important end cannot be obtained, unleſs rulers act uprightly and juſtly. When civil rulers, forgeting the end of their inſtitution, and the proper duties of their ſtation, neglect and trample upon the rules of juſtice; and conſult only to gratify their own pride and ambitious humour and paſſion: when they conſider their ſubjects as an inferior ſpecies of beings, made as beaſts of burden, for their pleaſure or profit;
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013614_0020_0F905B50D5E13240"/>
when, inſtead of obſerving the reaſon and nature of things, they make their own mere will and pleaſure, the rule of acting; and govern in an arbitrary, tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical manner; 'tis impoſſible to deſcribe the evils and miſchiefs they bring on mankind. Theſe have been ſo great and terrible, that ſome have been ready to queſtion, Whether civil rulers have not done more hurt than good, in the world. When we ſee an haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ambitious monarch, or corrupt Miniſtry ſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the blood and treaſure of their ſubjects, in carrying on an unrighteous quarrel and contention with them, or againſt their neighbours; from a miſtaken notion of glory; diſtreſſing their towns and cities with their troops and armaments, depopulating their country, and ſeeming to aim at the univerſal deſtruction of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; we may well be ſhock'd at the ſight, and look on ſuch a lawleſs, arbitrary ruler, as the heavieſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity and judgment, that a righteous God can ſend upon a ſinful people. But notwithſtanding the dark and diſmal proſpect which a ſcene of tyranny and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion affords; 'tis undoubtedly true, that civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is deſigned for the good of men; and when adminiſtered with juſtice and mercy, it does excellent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly well anſwer this deſign. As tyrants are the greateſt of temporal judgments, as being the cauſe of all the moſt diſtreſſing evils that can be imagined; ſo good rulers are the greateſt bleſſings to the world, and the inſtruments in God's hand, of ſecuring all our other good things. But then, to render them ſuch, they muſt be juſt, conſidered both in a legiſlative and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive capacity.</p>
            <p n="2">2. RULERS are obliged to be juſt, on account of the great truſt repoſed in them. Sovereign authority is the greateſt truſt that can be repoſed in any man. The power of making laws is very great, and extenſive in its nature, and of the utmoſt importance in the exerciſe of it. And next to this, is that of putting laws in execution. The man that is appointed to
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013614_0021_0F905B519A745E90"/>
judge another, with authority to decide all controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies among his fellow-ſubjects: to determine and paſs ſentence upon the lives and properties of ſuch vaſt numbers of men; has a very great and important truſt repoſed in him. And the weight and importance of the truſt repoſed in any inferiour executive officer, is proportioned to the authority veſted in him. Now, the receiving ſuch a truſt lays a man under very great obligations to faithfulneſs in the diſcharge of it. Men in ſuch high places of truſt and authority, inſtead of being releaſed from the laws of God, and having their obligations to faithfulneſs in the diſcharge of duty, leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and diminiſhed; have them increaſed, in proportion to their advancement; and it is not beneath the dignity of their ſtations, to attend very ſeriouſly to the advice and exhortation of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>Be wiſe now therefore, O ye kings; be inſtructed ye judges of the earth. Serve the Lord with fear; kiſs the ſon, lest he be angry, and ye periſh from the way, when his wrath is kindled but a little.</hi> 'Tis of importance, if men have but one talent, that they improve it: but if they have ten, and neglect and refuſe ſo to do; the puniſhment will be tenfold greater. If a private man neglects his duty, he, and others connected with him, may ſuffer. But if a chief ruler is unjuſt and unfaithful, the whole community or body politic ſuffers. As much therefore as the welfare and happineſs of ſuch a community, or body, is to be va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued above, and preferred to the happineſs of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual; ſo much higher and greater are his obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to faithfulneſs, than the obligations of a private member of ſociety; and if he refuſes to diſcharge them uprightly and conſcientiouſly, as in the fear of God; a proportionably heavy and aggravated puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment muſt he expect to receive, when judged by him.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE exerciſe of juſtice is neceſſary in civil rulers, to their own preſent comfort, and future happineſs. 'Tis a common obſervation, that the greateſt tyrants are the greateſt and moſt miſerable ſlaves. Thoſe ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013614_0022_0F905B52569474E0"/>
who invade the rights and liberties of their own ſubjects, in an arbitrary, tyrannical manner, and ſeek to oppreſs and enſlave them; are always in fear of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves deſtroyed by them. They are obliged, at vaſt expence, to keep up large armies to diſtreſs and enſlave their peaceable ſubjects; who, under ſuch a grievous yoke of bondage, cannot be eaſy and ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but will be naturally ſtruggling after liberty; and be ready, when it galls their necks, to turn againſt and depoſe ſuch oppreſſing tyrants; and ſometimes, to imbrue their hands in their blood: of which, many inſtances are to be found in the hiſtories of the Roman, and of the Turkiſh empire. Whereas, when princes rule in a juſt and conſtitutional way, with mildneſs and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nignity; and ſeek the good and welfare of their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; they may always put full, unreſerved confidence in them, and depend on being ſupported and defended by them, at the expence of all that is dear and valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to them; yea, at the expence of their lives, which will not be thought too dear a ſacrifice for the ſafety and honour of ſuch a worthy prince.</p>
            <p>AGAIN. This juſtice and faithfulneſs in rulers is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to their having peace in their own minds and conſciences. Such have conſciences as well as other men, accuſing or elſe excuſing; who, upon the faithful diſcharge of the high truſt repoſed in them, will have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward peace, ſecurity and joy, and heart-felt ſatisfaction, ſuch as the world can neither give, nor take away. But on the other hand; if the rules of juſtice and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs be neglected and trampled upon by them, and they practiſe high handed tyranny and oppreſſion: and ſeek to enſlave and deſtroy their ſubjects; what dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful horrors of conſcience muſt they neceſſarily feel, when awakened to any ſerious reflections on their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, guilty conduct, which has been ſo diſtreſſing and ruinous to thouſands more innocent and righteous than themſelves.</p>
            <p>LASTLY. This juſtice and faithfulneſs is neceſſary
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013614_0023_0F905B550C24B038"/>
to their future happineſs. Tho' civil rulers are ſtiled <hi>gods,</hi> yet muſt they die like men; and at laſt, give an account of themſelves to the judge of the quick, and the dead.</p>
            <p>I NOW proceed to the next thing propoſed, which was in the ſecond place, to ſhew, That the fear of the Lord is the proper, effectual principle to influence ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil rulers to the exact obſervance of juſtice.</p>
            <p>HE that ruleth over men, muſt be juſt: And that he may be ſo, he muſt rule in the fear of the Lord. If we conſider human nature, as vitiated by the apoſtacy; we ſhall find, that hardly any thing but the fear of puniſhment, is able to keep men in awe, and due ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection. That it is thus with ſubjects, is evident from the many ſevere laws, and terrible executions of them, which the wiſeſt and moſt merciful rulers in all nations, have found neceſſary to preſerve the peace, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the happineſs of civil ſociety. Now, 'tis certain that the eſſential principles of human nature are the ſame in all men, whatever external relations they ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. There is therefore great danger, that rulers will degenerate into tyrants; and of bleſſings, become plagues and curſes to mankind; unleſs there be ſome way to keep them in awe, ſome principle to excite their fears, and by that means, keep them within their proper ſphere, and engage them to the obſervation of juſtice. Now, this is not always to be done by a fear of men. Sovereigns are exempted from the common power of human laws; there is no ordinary authority that may judge them; and this their ſecurity may prove a ſtrong temptation to them, to neglect the proper duties of their exalted ſtations. They may truſt in their forces and armies to defend them from the reſentment of an injured and oppreſſed people; and ſo imagine them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves perfectly ſecure from puniſhment at preſent. And the nearer any ſubordinate ruler approaches to ſovereignty; the leſs has he to fear from men, and conſequently, the greater proſpect has he, of indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013614_0024_0F905B5674464F18"/>
in acting unjuſtly. There is therefore the utmoſt need and neceſſity, that thoſe who rule over men, ſhould rule in the fear of the Lord; that they ſhould have a firm belief of the being, perfections and providence of God; that they ſhould not only fear his vindictive puniſhing juſtice, but beyond this, as the text requires, maintain an holy awe and reverence of him upon their minds; and conſider him as that righteous judge to whom they muſt at laſt, give an account of the diſcharge of the great truſt repoſed in them; and from whom they ſhall receive a righteous ſentence of abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution or condemnation.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013614_0025_0F905B578A7980D8"/>
in any part of the earth. The bigger part of the world have had their liberties wreſted out of their hands; been oppreſt and enſlaved by lawleſs and cruel tyrants: while we are yet in the poſſeſſion of freedom.

               <p n="3">3. WHAT has been ſaid on this ſubject, is perfectly agreeable to, and juſtifies the principles on which the Britiſh nation acted, as a body, in depoſing king <hi>James</hi> the ſecond, that tyrannical oppreſſive prince, when purſuing meaſures tending to their deſtruction; and in introducing king <hi>William</hi> of glorious memory, to the throne, to ſway the ſcepter in righteouſneſs.

and unjuſtifiable for the people to think and judge for themſelves, and ſeek the beſt remedy in their power, when they found themſelves grievouſly oppreſſed by the unrelenting hand of arbitrary power: when they found their chief ruler fail in all the eſſential points of his high office and character, and to act contrary to the very end and deſign of its inſtitution; then it will follow, that the very foundation-principles of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment have been ſubverted by the revolution, and all, excepting a few that have been deemed rebels, both kings and their ſubjects have been upon a wrong, wicked plan, for near a century paſt. And to get right, we muſt throw up the preſent conſtitution of England and the <hi>Hanover</hi> family, that is in preſent poſſeſſion of the throne; and return back in our alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to the <hi>Stuart</hi> family; and to their popiſh plan of government.

As all human counſels and endeavours may be inſufficient for theſe important purpoſes of ſecuring and defending the rights and liberties of a people, when in danger of being wreſted out of their hands, by the violent exertions of arbitrary power; we ſee the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and the reaſonableneſs of the duty of looking to God, in a way of ſolemn faſting and prayer, at ſuch a time, for deliverance and ſafe protection. God, the ſovereign ruler of the world, has the great affairs of the kingdoms and empires of the earth, in his own hands; and can diſpoſe of them as ſeems good unto him. He has the hearts of kings and miniſters in his hands, and can turn them, as he turns the rivers of water. In ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of ſuch danger and diſtreſs, our eyes and our hearts ſhould be lifted up to him, for that help and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief that we need. And as we are now called to this important duty, by the pious rulers of the land; all that are ſo far above the beaſts that periſh, as to know the rights, the liberties and privileges that eſſentially belong to humanity; and withal, have any belief of the being of a God, and of his governing providence, will, I truſt, heartily unite herein, with a very ſerious and devout frame of mind; while the ignorant, the profane, and ſtupid infidals, may probably make a ſcoff and ridicule of theſe ſacred ſolemnities.</p>
               <p>THE great controverſy that has for ſome years, ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted between the chief rulers in the mother country, and the Engliſh colonies in America, has ariſen to a very great height: and let the fault be on which ſide it will, we have reaſon to tremble at the conſequences; as we are threatened with moſt awful ruin and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction in all that is dear and valuable to us. A neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring province begins to feel very ſenſibly, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing effects thereof; as great numbers of its induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious inhabitants are reduced to a ſuffering ſtate, and become real objects of charity; being turned out of the means by which they procured their daily bread. The chief rulers neither feed nor guide them: but are

uſing means that tend to devour and deſtroy them. And no other colony or province on the continent has the leaſt ſecurity from having the ſame cruel, oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive and tyrannical meaſures uſed towards them. All the moſt judicious and ſenſible part of the inhabitants thro' the whole continent of America, view themſelves as intereſted and concerned in the conſequences of this diſpute; and expect to ſtand or fall by the iſſue of it. The port and harbour of <hi>Boſton</hi> has, for ſome time been ſhut up; their trade and commerce ſtopped; their charter-rights invaded; the ſecurity of their lives, liberties and properties, taken away; with an armed force in the midſt of them, to heighten their diſtreſs, and bring on their complete ruin. Which reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble province, and metropolis of New-England, being once enſlaved by the cruel exertions of arbitrary power, and ſtript of their property for which they, and their anceſtors have been, for ſo many years induſtriouſly labouring; ſome other colony or province will, no doubt, be taken in hand: and ſo the horrid and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable ſcene of tyranny and oppreſſion be vigorouſly proſecuted from place to place, until it ſpread over the whole continent. The aſpect of our public affairs was never more dark and gloomy, than at the preſent day.

Whoſe hand is to be conſidered in theſe dark clouds that hang over, theſe diſtreſſing judgments that are coming on the land.

And how ſhall we obtain his favour?—Sins of any kind, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come common; when they are openly practiſed, and that with impunity; bring public guilt; and it may be expected, that if men don't teſtify againſt them, God himſelf will do it; and that, by ſending diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing judgments on a people. And God's judgments, and threatnings of providence are ſometimes of ſuch a nature, as to point out the particular kinds of ſin by which he is offended.

Is it not a plain indication that God is offended with that covetouſneſs or exceſſive love of the world which abounds? That inordinate love of money, which is the root of all evil? It is ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this, that men murmur and complain under that public charge which the preſent ſtate of things makes neceſſary; and which, after all our complaints, is no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like what the generality of men are ſubject to, in their beſt times, when they have the greateſt peace, and leaſt public expence. It has been repreſented, that ſome uneaſy, diſſatisfied perſons, who are diſaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected to the privileges of their country, have gone ſo far as to ſay, They had rather that the king and his miniſtry might come, and take away our charter-privileges, and all that we have, than to pay ſuch tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es for the ſupport of government over them. To ſuch, if there are any ſuch among us, I would recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend a ſerious conſideration of the awful ſentence God pronounced againſt the murmuring Iſraelites in the wilderneſs. Numb. xiv.28. <hi>As truly as I live, ſaith the Lord, as ye have ſpoken in mine ears, ſo will I do to you.</hi> I will here cite a paſſage from a ſermon of the Rev. Mr. <hi>Trumbull,</hi> delivered at the Freeman's-meeting, in the town of <hi>New-Haven,</hi> April 12th, 1773, with his note ſubjoined thereto. Speaking of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of free ſtates, ariſing from their chooſing ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers from among themſelves, he obſerves concerning rulers thus choſen, "Their government is mild and righteous. And as they do not govern <hi>to get their bread,</hi> and advance their fortunes, at the <hi>ruin</hi> of ours; and as they can lay no burdens on us, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bearing the ſame weight themſelves, their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is as remarkable for the little expence of it, as it is for its gentleneſs, impartiality and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. All our expences, by way of ſalary to civil officers, do not, I imagine, amount annually, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, to the one <hi>half</hi> of the ſalary of a king's go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013614_0034_0F905B5FDF9046C8"/>
in any of the neighbouring provinces." <note n="*" place="bottom">"The whole amount of the ſalaries paid annually by the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment is only £.580. The Salary of the Governor is £.300. of the Deputy Governour £. 100, of the Secretary £. 20, and of the Treaſurer £. 160. The Judges of the Superior Court have no ſalary from the government. The Chief Judge is allowed 18 ſhillings per day, and the four ſide Judges have 17 ſhillings each per day. This court is obliged by law, to ſet 14 weeks annually, and commonly ſetteth, by adjournment, much longer, and the coſt of it is about £. 600 per annum. The expence of it for three years and a half paſt, upon a careful examination, appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to be about £. 2100, juſt £. 600 per annum. The avails of it, together with the forfeitures, for the ſame term, with proper allowances for ſuch as may not be recovered, amount to £. 2200 So that the Superior Court is of no coſt, at preſent, to the Colony, conſidered as a Government. In ſhort the whole expence of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment in Connecticut is trifling. The coſt of the General Aſſembly annually is about £. 1500. A rate of one penny on the pound, on the Grand Liſt, which raiſeth about £. 6000 per An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, near the one half of which is annually taken out of the Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury for Schooling, hath of late years been ſufficient to defray all our public charges as a Government." <bibl>

                  </note> On the other hand, the preſent judgment, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning diſcover God's diſpleaſure againſt us, for indulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pride and vanity, luxury and intemperance.

               <p>WE are further threatened with being deprived of all our civil privileges, and brought under a moſt cruel, arbitrary and tyrannical kind of government. The ſcheme of government planned out for <hi>Boſton,</hi> is in its whole frame and conſtitution, completely <hi>deſpotic</hi> and <hi>arbitrary.</hi> The <hi>will</hi> of the chief ruler is <hi>law</hi>; and the ſubject holds his eſtate, and even life, only during his pleaſure. This arbitrary government will, no doubt, be carried to its greateſt extent through all the American colonies, and exerciſed in all its terrors and cruelties upon them, if the preſent miniſtry are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to carry the point they are contending for, in ſuch a ſanguine manner.</p>
               <p>Now, does not this threatning point out ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſins, as procuring it? We have been greatly
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013614_0035_0F905B60B21F0E00"/>
favoured of God in reſpect to the conſtitution of the government more immediately over us; and the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of our public affairs. We in this colony enjoy, not only the full liberties of Engliſhmen; but even ſome peculiar privileges, confirmed by royal charter, which diſtinguiſh us from the reſt of our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low ſubjects in the plantations.—But how far have we been from being truly thankful for ſuch privileges? And how ready to ſlight and abuſe them? How ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly have ſome wiſhed themſelves in the condition of the poor tenants and ſlaves in a neigbouring province, rather than pay a trifle to ſupport their liberties, and freedom, and real eſtate, in this? How apt have we been to deſpiſe the perſons, and ſlight the authority of the rulers of our people? To hearken to, and propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate reports prejudicial to their character? To counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and join with the diſaffected, a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>d begrudge their reward; which is far leſs than magiſtrates in any other province have? And after all the murmuring about it, is very inadequate to the public ſervices they perform, and the advantages we derive from their adminiſtration. There was ſomething of this diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition in the Jews of old: <hi>They refuſed the waters of Shiloah that run ſoftly</hi>—they were diſcontented and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thankful under a mild government, and gentle admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration, that allowed them great privileges and li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties; therefore God threatens to bring upon them <hi>the waters of the river, ſtrong and many,</hi> or to ſubject them to the tyrannical government of the king of Aſſyria.</p>
               <p>ONCE more. We are awfully threatened with being deprived of the liberty of our conſciences, the liberty of profeſſing the important truths of the goſpe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; and attending thoſe ſacred ordinances which God has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted with a view to advance the glory of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, and promote the ſalvation of his people. This will moſt probably be the conſequence of carrying thoſe ſchemes and plans into execution, which the preſent miniſtry have projected.—And does not this
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013614_0036_0F905B61529EF3D8"/>
loudly declare, That our having neglected the worſhip, and turned our backs upon the ordinances of God; our diſtruſting and deſpiſing the grace of the goſpel, and trifling away the day of ſalvation; are to be numbered among thoſe ſins by which we have awfully provoked a righteous God to anger againſt us. That omiſſions and neglects of this kind, have abounded to an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual, and indeed, to an aſtoniſhing degree, cannot be denied. That ſuch ſins are provoking to God, and that eſpecially, in a country which, like this, was origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally ſettled principally for the purpoſes of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and religion, cannot reaſonably be doubted. And therefore we may juſtly conclude, that God is teſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt theſe kinds of ſin in particular, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning us on account of them. Shame and ſorrow, humiliation and abaſement become us for theſe things. We ought, each one, to examine his own heart and life, and enquire what has been done by, or among us, to provoke the Lord to ſuch an awful controverſy; and ſpeedily to return, by goſpel-repentance, to his love and ſervice; and to the ſteady conſcientious prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of all religious duties he requires of us. Let us be deeply affected with the preſent critical and alarming ſituation of our public affairs; and unite in fervent prayers to that God who is higher than the kings of the earth, that he would graciouſly interpoſe for our relief; that he would avert the impending ſtorms of vengeance, and favour us with peace and tranquility, and the full enjoyment of all our valuable liberties and privileges; that our rulers may feed us accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the integrity of their hearts, and guide us by the ſkilfulneſs of their hands.</p>
               <p>And let us be at peace among ourſelves. It is at all times contrary to the temper and ſpirit of the goſpel; but eſpecially unſuitable and improper in ſuch a day as this, to be widening differences, laying unreaſonable ſtreſs upon diſputable points, and to ſet on foot controverſies that tend to alienate people's love and affection from each other, and to increaſe a party ſeparating ſpirit, to
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013614_0037_0F905B6221F2DF48"/>
ſow the ſeeds of diſcord, and foment animoſities. It rather becomes us to fix our attention upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe, the public good and general intereſt of the land. Our ſtrength, our glory, and our ſecurity de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend very much upon our friendly agreement and firm union together. If we get divided and broken to pieces among ourſelves, what will become of us? What advantage will it give an enemy to our liberties, to bring diſtreſſing burdens upon us, and lay ſuch a yoke upon our necks that neither we, nor our poſterity can bear. That to which our ſpecial attention is at this day called, is not a private by-intereſt, that concerns the men of one denomination only: but of a general, public nature that concerns men of every perſuaſion, that are well-wiſhers to their country's welfare. Even thoſe who have gone off from the ſcheme and plan of religion profeſſed by the firſt fathers of this country, have great cauſe of thankfulneſs for their liberties and privileges which they enjoy equally with others that ſtill retain it. They have the ſame advantages from that happy form of civil government; the ſame protection from it, of their perſons and properties; have the ſame liberty of conſcience, worſhip where they pleaſe without controul or oppreſſion; or if they chooſe to ſtay at home on the Lord's-day, and join with no worſhiping aſſembly, it is ſeldom they meet with any interruption or diſturbance. What more can they deſire? There does not appear the leaſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability that either they, or we, ſhould gain any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage on civil or religious accounts, by giving up our privileges; and ſubmitting to a new and different form of government in church and ſtate; with a great additional burden of taxes which would be unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly connected with it; under which, who would groan and complain loudeſt, we cannot tell before trial be made. I hope none of us wiſh for ſuch a fatal experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and proof of a public ſpirit.

Let us love as brethren and dear countrymen, that have but one common intereſt to purſue. Let us act on principles of moderation, candor and charity; and endeavour in meekneſs of wiſdom to inſtruct thoſe that oppoſe themſelves, and their country's good; and recover them to the paths of truth. Let us prize and well improve our privileges, and uſe our influence to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the public good.

So far as any of us have influence on our public affairs, let us uſe it for the promotion and advancement of the true friends to their country. We want wiſe, ſteady, ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious rulers in ſuch a day as this; men of ſterling integrity and real religion. It is of importance that all orders of men be faithful in their ſeveral depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for defending and promoting the public good. Let us keep ſtedfaſtly fixed in the good old principles of our fathers, and cheerfully take our lot and porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on one with another; ſaying as <hi>Ruth</hi> to <hi>Naomi,</hi> Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou goeſt, I will go; thy people ſhall be my people, and thy God my God. The Lord's hand has been very conſpicuous in the firſt ſettlement, and paſt preſervation of theſe plantations: He will take care of the generation of the righteous; and break the yoke of their oppreſſors; and give them peace and happineſs. Bleſſed are the people that are under his care and conduct; yea, bleſſed are the people whoſe God is the Lord. AMEN.</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE ſubſtance of the following Appendix was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, with a view to enlighten the people of a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try town, not under the beſt advantages for information from the news papers and other pieces wrote upon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, into the true ſtate of the preſent unhappy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes between Great Britain and the colonies; for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it ſtill appears in the form of an addreſs to the people. It has been thought the publication of it might anſwer va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable purpoſes, to rouſe others in the weſtern part of this colony, who are much in the ſame ſituation with the people for whoſe information it was firſt compoſed, to a ſenſe of the danger in which their liberties are now involved. The Author is very willing to contribute his mite to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe of liberty; and is very glad of an opportunity to ſubjoin the following Addreſs as an appendix to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe ſo well adapted (as he imagines the foregoing is) to lead people to a ſenſe of the true nature of civil government, and of the abſurdity of many ridiculous whims; which ſome among us have the impudence to attempt to maintain in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect oppoſition to thoſe principles, which have ſeated the preſent Royal Family on the Britiſh throne.</p>
            <p>Should this appendix fall into the hands of any, that have been more awake to a ſenſe of our danger; than what hath been the caſe in the weſtern parts of this colony; the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor hopes they will readily overlook the mention of many things, which muſt be trite and common to them; as the particular mention of them was neceſſary to the deſign in view.</p>
            <p>The ſilence of others on a ſubject of ſo much importance, and (as many think) ſo neceſſary to be wrote upon at the

preſent time, muſt plead in excuſe of the Clergy, if they write upon a ſubject by ſome deemed too political for their province: But let it be remembered that clergymen are free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men as well as others; have civil rights and privileges in common with their fellow ſubjects; are capable of feeling oppreſſion as well as others: why then is there not an equal obligation on them, as on others, to ſtand forth in defence of their country, and endeavour to ſound the alarm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they ſee every thing that is dear and valuable in the utmoſt danger? Were a houſe on fire and the family ſecurely ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing while the flames were ſurrounding them; would it not be the height of folly, for thoſe that were by, to ſtand diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting who was the propereſt perſon to give the alarm, and awake them from their dangerous repoſe? Much like this is it, to diſpute who are the propereſt perſons, the clergy or others, to point out to their fellow ſubjects the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger their country is in. The preſent criſis calls for the vigorous exertions of every rank and order of men.</p>
            <p>The Author is not inſenſible that it is more faſhionable to write <hi>anonimouſly</hi> upon ſuch ſubjects as theſe, and would it equally anſwer the end propoſed, he would very gladly lie concealed: But he thinks the public are liable to be greatly impoſed upon on the one ſide and the other by anonymous publications; as in that caſe no-body is reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for what is aſſert<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>d. And as there are no ſentiments in the following compoſition, which he is aſhamed to own; or unwilling the world ſhould believe are his—no facts aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted but what he verily believes to be true. He can't but think it may better ſubſerve the purpoſe for which it is publiſhed, to have his name prefix'd; than to be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without a name.</p>

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>NEVER was there a period ſo alarming to the Engliſh American colonies as the preſent is; ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver one that called for the careful attention, the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, yet vigorous exertion of every freeman in the colonies as the preſent doth! For when our lives, and our property are ſubject to the arbitrary diſpoſal of others; what have we valuable we can call our own? The diſpoſal of our property is now openly claimed by others; by a body, in which we have no repreſentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and upon which we have not the leaſt check or controul: and charters, heretofore deemed <hi>ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred</hi> and inviolable; by which, we have been wont to ſuppoſe, was ſecured to us the quiet poſſeſſion of our lives and properties, are now wantonly violated with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out even the form of a trial; and ſuch modes of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicial proceedings introduced into a neighbouring province, as very much ſubject the lives of the people to the arbitrary diſpoſal of their governor. And doubtleſs this is but a ſpecimen of the plan adopted with regard to all the provinces; which will ſoon be introduced, if this firſt attempt ſucceed. We have to expect, if the meaſures adopted are carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to execution, we ſhall hold both our lives and our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty in coming time upon the moſt precarious tenure. Theſe meaſures you ſee are carrying into execution by the terror of military force both by ſea and by land. And if our lives and our property are to be held by ſuch a precarious tenure as the arbitrary will of thoſe, who may be ſet over us, what is there in life or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty worth the poſſeſſing? Will not the being in conſtant and perpetual fear of the deprivation of both, imbitter all the comforts of life? Could you take a view of the nations which are groaning under arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and deſpotic government; you would never ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine

what I ſay to be chimerical. We have not (bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed be God) as yet experienced the galling chains of ſlavery; tho' they have been ſhook over our heads. For this reaſon few perhaps among us, realize the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of that ſlavery, which arbitrary and deſpotic go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment lays men under.</p>
            <p>Some poſſibly may think me extravagant in aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there never was ſo alarming a period to the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh American colonies, as the preſent is: But I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think any one needs any more, than to be thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with the preſent ſtate of public affairs, to be wholly of my opinion. We have, it is true, in times paſt, been alarmed with the horrors of war: the ſavages have committed ſhocking murders and made terrible devaſtations upon our expoſed frontiers; but theſe were but temporary evils: while the preſent (if God prevent not) will extend their influence to all ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding generations. And is the death of a number of individuals in war ſo great a calamity to the public, as a whole country's being enſlaved, and the lives and the properties not only of the preſent, but of ſucceding generations ſubjected to the caprice of arbitrary rulers?</p>
            <p>Under the adminiſtration <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> 
               <hi>Sir Edmund Androſs,</hi> near ninety years ago, very gloomy indeed was the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to our fathers: yet in many reſpects not ſo gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my as at the preſent day. Charters, 'tis true, were <hi>then</hi> taken away; but they were taken away under colour of law; upon trial in courts of juſtice: But <hi>now</hi> they are taken away, without ſo much as a pretence of law; without ſo much as a trial, or hearing of the party concerned, by the almoſt omnipotent power claimed by the Britiſh parliament: And when only the courts of juſtice are corrupted, there is more hopes things may revert to a right channel; than when the corruption lies in the ſupreme legiſlative body. At <hi>that time</hi> the arbitrary meaſures purſued proceeded only from an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitrary prince; <hi>now,</hi> from an arbitrary parliament.
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:013614_0046_0F905B6B1230E7F8"/>
               <hi>Then</hi> the nation was awake to the arbitrary meaſures purſuing: <hi>now</hi> they ſupinely ſlumber. <hi>Then</hi> Britain felt the weight of the iron hand of tyranny; while <hi>now</hi> they imagine their burdens relieved by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of America. Which circumſtances rendered the continuance of arbitrary government vaſtly leſs likely at that time, than at the preſent day. It is not therefore, without a cauſe, that the whole continent ſeems as it were ſtruck with horror and amazement; that the attention of almoſt every American is rouſed to the preſent ſtate of our public affairs. And tho' ſome may be tranſported with a wild and enthuſiaſtic rage in the cauſe of liberty, and ſome others may be ſtupid and inſenſible of real danger; yet all the more ſober thinking part feel impreſſed with a deep and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licitous concern for the event of theſe things. But in a place remote from public intelligence as this is, few comparatively can have opportunity to peruſe the public papers, and otner writings, which may open to us the preſent alarming ſituation of our country. Many, therefore, are perhaps little acquainted with what our danger is. They do not themſelves as yet feel the weight of oppreſſion. They hear the noiſe of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger echoed round the country, but know very little of what gives the alarm. For the information of ſuch as have not been under advantages for proper intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, I will briefly as I can relate to you what hath been done by the Britiſh parliament with regard to A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, which gives the preſent alarm.—What the grievances are we labour under from theſe acts of the Britiſh parliament—what we have juſt reaſon to fear the conſequences of theſe meaſures will be—then juſt hint at a few things proper for us to do in the preſent alarming criſis.</p>
            <p>Here I may premiſe, that the Engliſh American co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, at leaſt I may ſay the New-England colonies were ſettled without any coſt to the crown. Private adventurers that they might enjoy the ſweets of both

civil and religious liberty, in a great meaſure denied them in their native land, ventured into this, then a howling wilderneſs; and a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> their own expence laid the foundation of theſe flouriſhing colonies. All they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the king was charters ſecuring to them the rights and privileges of Engliſhmen in this new-found world: here amid numerous wars with the barbarous ſavages in their infant ſtate, they defended them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without any expence to the crown. Afterwards when the nation was engaged in war, they complied with every requiſition from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>king. They exerted themſelves beyond their abilities in two expenſive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditions againſt Canada, in the reigns of William &amp; Anne, which proved unſucceſsful. In the war before the laſt, at their own motion, and almoſt wholly at their own expence, they took the important fortreſs of Louiſbourg, which gave peace to Europe. In the laſt war 'tis freſh in every one's memory how chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly they complied with every requiſition of men or mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from the Crown: for ſeveral years near a quarter of the militia of New-England were in actual ſervice. Yet, with what alacrity performed? Who ever heard a murmur or complaint of our expence of blood and treaſure, tho' Britain reaped the profit of our conqueſt, as all the conquered lands were theirs? Britain was ſo ſenſible of the ſpirited exertions of the Colonies at that time;—ſenſible they had contributed more than their proportion, that they refunded to them a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable part of their expence. Hitherto they had neither claimed, nor exerted any right to tax the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies: and every one, who remembers that time, knows how ardent our affections were to the mother country, we gloried in our relation to Britain—were ready to fight and bleed for her glory and honour.</p>
            <p>As America was much the ſeat of the laſt war, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

attended to in England, than it had been in times paſt. And as in a country like this, where property is ſo equally divided, every one will be diſpoſed to rival his neighbour in go<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>dneſs of dreſs, ſumptuouſneſs of fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, &amp;c. All our little earnings therefore went to Britain to purchaſe mainly the ſuperfluities of life. Hence the common people here make a ſhow, much above what they do in England. The luxury and ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluities in which even the lower ranks of people here indulge themſelves, being reported in England by the officers and ſoldiers upon their return, excited in the people there a very exalted idea of the riches of this country, and the abilities of the inhabitants to bear taxes. The miniſtry ſoon conceived hopes that a large revenue might be raiſed from America.—A revenue that would be ſolely at their own diſpoſal, whereby they might provide for great numbers of their depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants, and mightily enlarge their influence over the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, to ſecure a majority in their meaſures. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly in a few years after the concluſion of the late war; the Britiſh parliament, for the firſt time, laid a tax upon America, by what was called the <hi>ſtamp-act</hi>: by which almoſt every written inſtrument of a public nature was ſubject to a high duty. Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſitions of men or money were no longer made as uſual from the king to the colonies: but their money is now to be extorted from them by an act of the Britiſh parliament. 'Tis doubtleſs freſh in your memories, what an alarm this <hi>new</hi> claim of parliament gave to the colonies; what unanimous and vigorous oppoſition was made to the execution of the act: the ſtampt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were either deſtroyed, or kept from being diſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>buted throughout America: Trade with Great Britain was in a good degree ſuſpended:—In ſhort, a glorious ſtruggle was made againſt this <hi>firſt</hi> exertion of a parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary claim of taxation over America. The iſſue of the ſtruggle was happy. The parliament the next ſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, repealed the act, tho' not upon the principles it
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:013614_0049_0F905B704E14B898"/>
could have been wiſhed for, i. e. of its being <hi>unconſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal</hi>; but upon the footing of its being <hi>inexpedient</hi> and ill-ſuited to the ſtate of the colonies. The parliament ſtill claimed a right of making ſtatutes to bind the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies in all caſes whatſoever. They ſtill claimed the right of taxing them at pleaſure. Duties were accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly laid upon ſundry articles of merchandize payable upon their landing in America, as on <hi>tea, glaſs, paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers colours,</hi> &amp;c. part of which were afterwards taken off by parliament. There are alſo duties that have here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore been laid on other articles of trade; but as they were ſuppoſed to be laid only to defray the expences of regulating trade; the colonies acquieſced in them with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any complaint: but the duties on tea, &amp;c. being for the expreſs purpoſe of raiſing a revenue to his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, and being in conſequence of the parliament's claim to make ſtatutes to bind the colonies in all caſes whatſoever, excited continual murmurs and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints in the colonies: however as the tax was incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, it raiſed no conſiderable tumults. Soon after this <hi>new admiralty courts</hi> were erected throughout Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. The powers of which courts were extended much beyond what they are in England, or what they had been in America. But as I have not by me, the act of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament conſtituting thoſe courts, I can only obſerve upon them in general as what Americans complain of. An expenſive <hi>Board of Commiſſioners</hi> for managing the revenue were conſtituted with the moſt extravagant powers.—They have power to conſtitute as many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der officers as they pleaſe; they are impowered to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>general warrants</hi> from the judges of courts in America: i. e. warrants to ſearch any body, and any where for contraband goods; under pretence of which, they may ſearch any man's moſt private apartments; not even his deſk or drawers, or any thing would be ſecure. But as I am not poſſeſſed of the act conſtitut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this board, I cannot be further particular upon it. The judges of the admiralty and the commiſſioners have
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:013614_0050_0F905B706850F028"/>
both the moſt extravagant ſalaries; the former each <hi>ſix hundred,</hi> the latter <hi>five hundred</hi> pounds ſterling per annum, paid out of the American revenue, beſides the perquiſites of their offices. And yet it has been report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of one at leaſt of theſe judges of admiralty, that for two years or more he has had but one caſe to try. Theſe, with a ſwarm of petty cuſtom-houſe officers ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by the commiſſioners, exhauſt almoſt the whole of the revenue. It is ſaid, there was but 86<hi>l.</hi> the laſt year paid into the king's exchequer. So that all the money raiſed is ſpent to maintain a ſet of <hi>idle drones</hi> in eaſe and luxury, without doing any ſervice to their king or country. The colonies from a reluctance to pay theſe, as they deemed them, unconſtitutional duties, have, it is probable, purchaſed a conſiderable part of their teas from the Dutch; by which means the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity imported from Great Britain hath been much leſs ſince the duty was laid than before; which cauſed an immenſe quantity of tea to lie upon the hands of the <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> company. With the approbation, if not by the propoſal of the miniſtry, they reſolve to ſend a large quantity of it to America upon their own riſk. Several ſhips loaded with tea were accordingly ſent to ſeveral different ports in America. This gave a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral alarm thro' the Colonies. They tho't the mother country was now reſolved to fa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

               </gap> the chains of ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry upon them; as they would not leave us at our own option whether we would import the Tea or not; but were reſolved to force it upon us. A general reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſeems therefore to have been come into throughout the colonies, not to ſuffer the tea to be landed. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly at Philadelphia, New-York and Portſmouth, and I am apt to think from ſome other parts of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica; alſo, they perſuaded the maſters of the ſhips to return to England, without unlading. At Boſton, the governor would not ſuffer the tea ſhip to paſs the caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle without a clearance. A clearance could not be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained without ſhe entered and unladed. So that there
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:013614_0051_0F905B7118A96678"/>
was no other alternative, the people muſt either ſuffer the tea to be landed or deſtroy it; accordingly a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of perſons went in diſguiſe and emptied it all into the ſea. At New-York alſo a quantity of the ſame tea was deſtroyed in like manner. When news was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in England, of the deſtroying of the tea in Boſton; the miniſtry thinking that a proper opportunity now preſented, for carrying the deſigns they had long ſince formed into execution, immediately hurried thro' the parliament, the act for blocking up the harbour of the town of Boſton. This act forbids the ſhipping or landing any kind of merchandize whatſoever, (except fuel and victuals for the neceſſary ſuſtenance of the inhabitants of the town) any where within Boſton bay. Veſſels, bound for Boſton with proviſions, muſt firſt be ſearched at Marblehead, muſt take an officer on board, and enter at Salem, before they may proceed to the town. By this act all the trade of the town of Boſton is ſtopped, which was the whole ſupport of the town; and 'tis calculated to diſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">

company for the tea deſtroyed; but till the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor has certified that reaſonable ſatisfaction hath been made for all the injuries done to the cuſtom houſe officers in times paſt. This bill, ſo pregnant with miſchief, was hurried with the greateſt precipitancy thro' both houſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of parliament; the deſign was for a while kept en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely ſecret, leſt there ſhould be petitions againſt the bill. They never propoſed to the inhabitants of Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton whether they would make ſatisfaction for the inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries done or not. They never gave them any oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſpeak a word in their own defence;— a pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vilege allowed to the meaneſt criminal in every court of juſtice. Altho' ſolicited in both houſes, they would not ſo much as ſuffer their agent to ſpeak in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half.</p>
            <p>This Act hath been followed by two others reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that province equally alarming, hurried thro' the parliament with the ſame precipitant haſte as the other; without notifying the province to appear in their own defence, or allowing their agent to ſpeak in their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half. The one is intituled <hi>An <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> for the better regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the government of the province of Maſſachuſetts-Bay.</hi> Whereby in direct violation of the privileges granted by charter, the appointment of the council is taken out of the hands of the general aſſembly and veſted with the king; the governor's power is greatly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged, ſo that he may appoint all the judges, juſtices, ſheriffs and other inferior officers, and remove them at pleaſure without any concurrence of council. The inhabitants are forbid to aſſemble in town meeting ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by ſpecial licenſe obtained from the governor; only in their annual meeting, and then to tranſact no other buſineſs than juſt the appointment of town-officers. Jurors, that were before returned by the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial method of drawing them out of a box, are now to be ſummoned at the pleaſure of the ſheriff. And left all this ſhould not be ſufficient to ſcreen the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers or the officers either of the governor or of the

cuſtom-houſe, who ſhould happen to commit murder upon the inhabitants, from deſerved puniſhment: There is another act paſſed, intituled <hi>An act for the impartial adminiſtration of juſtice,</hi> &amp;c. which impowers the governor upon the indictment of any of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, officers, &amp;c. for any capital offence, when acting in execution of any of theſe laws, or under the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any magiſtrate, to remove the trial into any other province, or if he ſees fit, into Great-Britain: oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the proſecutor and witneſſes to appear there or to drop the proſecution. This is the ſubſtance of the late acts reſpecting the Maſſachuſetts; which are now rigorouſly carrying into execution: A large fleet blocking up their harbour, and ſix or ſeven regiments of ſoldiers quartered in the town of Boſton, beſide ſome others in the neighbourhood.</p>
            <p>There is another act lately parted in the Britiſh par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, for regulating the government of the province of Quebec, which greatly alarms the nation in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral as well as America in particular. Thouſands of Engliſh people have ſettled in that province under the faith of a royal proclamation, that the Engliſh laws ſhould take place there, and a government like that of the other colonies as ſoon as the circumſtances of the province would permit. But by this act all the <hi>French</hi> laws in being before the conqueſt are reſtored—<hi>Popery</hi> is eſtabliſhed and proviſion is made for the legal ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the popiſh clergy by the collection of tythes.— Trials by jury are taken away, and the whole legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power lodged in a council appointed by the king; what aſpect this may have upon us ſhall be conſidered hereafter.</p>
            <p>Thus I have related the principal facts with reſpect to America on which the preſent grievances and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous proſpects of the Americans are founded. I proceed now to conſider what thoſe grievances are, which we have cauſe to complain of, from theſe acts of the Britiſh parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:013614_0054_0F905B7369D2AE28"/>The firſt thing we complain of as a grievance is, that by taxing the colonies for the purpoſe of raiſing a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue, and claiming a right to make laws or ſtatutes in all caſes binding on the Colonies, the parliament claim what they have no right to, by the Britiſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and thereby deny us our <hi>natural</hi> rights as men, and our <hi>conſtitutional</hi> rights as Engliſhmen. This I will conſider ſomewhat particularly, as 'tis at the foundation of our complaints: for if the parliament have rightfully ſuch a power as this, the Americans only are to blame in the preſent diſputes, that ſubſiſt between Great-Britain and the Colonies: In order to which we may with propriety advert a little to the foundation of civil government in general, and the principles of the Britiſh government in particular.</p>
            <p>That, which induces any number of individuals to enter into compact for civil government, is the greater ſecurity of their lives and properties; which in a ſtate of nature are expoſed to every invader, and liable to be taken away with impunity by any one that is ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than we. In a ſociety formed for the purpoſes of government, there is the united power of the whole to ſuppreſs ſuch injurious invaders. It is the duty of thoſe who thus combine together for government to give up ſo much of their property into the hands of thoſe who are intruſted with authority, as is neceſſary to carry on government: But then it would be very prepoſterous, when they entered into ſociety to ſecure their property, to give it up to be wholly at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of any one man or body of men: this would be to put their property in a worſe ſtate than the ſtate of nature. 'Tis therefore to be preſumed that every body of people entering into compact for civil government will keep the diſpoſal of their property<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in their own hands, and make grants of it to their rulers as the exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies of government ſhall require: otherwiſe they put it into the power of their rulers to exerciſe every kind of tyranny over them. And thus it is ſaid with
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:013614_0055_0F905B74119F69E0"/>
the greateſt propriety, that every man hath a natural right to diſpoſe of his <hi>own</hi> property. And every man hath a natural right to life, unleſs he hath been guilty of ſuch conduct, that by the laws of nature he forfeits it; i. e. hath ſo conducted that it is evident others can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſecure in the poſſeſſion of their lives and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties without life is taken from him: Another benefit of ſociety therefore is to have perſons appointed, who can be truſted, to judge when this is the caſe; that we may not be liable to have our lives taken away at the capricious pleaſure of every one, that may judge we have forfeited them; as is the caſe in a ſtate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: But then as life is our moſt darling poſſeſſion, no body of men acting rationally will intruſt this power with any man or number of men, without uſing every precaution for the right exerciſe of it.</p>
            <p>The Engliſh conſtitution moſt admirably provides for the ſecurity both of our lives and our properties. In that great <hi>charter</hi> of liberties, commonly called <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which our anceſtors obtained by the moſt painful ſtruggles; 'tis a fundamental article<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that no man ſhall be taxed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t by his own conſent: But as every individual of the nation cannot meet to grant taxes; there becomes a neceſſity of their meeting by repreſentation; and accordingly the Britiſh parliament repreſent all the people of Great-Britain; are choſen by them, and the <hi>ſole</hi> right of granting money is veſted in them: Neither the king nor houſe of lords have power to raiſe one penny of money upon the ſubject: And as the parliament when they grant money to the king, tax themſelves in common with others, and as they are expoſed to loſe their places the next election, if they do not conduct according to the mind of their conſtituents; the people have the greateſt ſecurity that can be, that they will grant no more money than what the purpoſes of government, the good of the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the honour of the nation require. So likewiſe are our lives moſt admirably guarded in that charter
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:013614_0056_0F905B7793211C28"/>
of privileges which our forefathers obtained: In which 'tis provided that no man ſhall be impriſoned but by the laws of the land—No man's life ſhall be taken away, (either by the king or judges appointed by him,) but by the voice of his country repreſented by twelve honeſt men of the neighbourhood where the crime is committed, called together in ſome impartial manner; who, 'tis to be preſumed, can have no intereſt in acting otherwiſe than juſtly. Theſe two. viz. the right of taxing themſelves, and trials by jury, eſpecially in capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal caſes, have ever been deemed by the people of England their fundamental privileges; the violation of which was the principal cauſe of that dreadful civil war in England about a century ago, which at laſt brought an arbitrary king to the block. A violation of theſe, with other attempts to ſubvert the conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, dethroned king JAMES the ſecond, and advanced WILLIAM and MARY to the throne. So jealous have Engliſhmen ever been of theſe important rights and privileges. Now the firſt of theſe the parliament go di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly in the face of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when they lay taxes on the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans; as we are not repreſented in the Britiſh parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by reaſon of our diſtance can never have an equal repreſentation there. When they lay taxes on us, they feel none of the burdens they impoſe; and we have no influence over them, as the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land have, by dropping the members of parliament, if they conduct wrong<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the next election. They do in reallity take away our money from us by force, and make a preſent of it to the king. 'Tis not that we are againſt contributing to defray the expences of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, that cauſes us to complain of theſe taxes: But becauſe our money is forced from us in an illegal manner, in direct violation of that fundamental privilege of Engliſhmen, <hi>a right to tax themſelves</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The colonies are repreſented in their reſpective general aſſemblies, and no where elſe; and whenever the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="60" facs="unknown:013614_0057_0F905B78F0AF1E98"/>
readily granted them: And would his majeſty <hi>aſk</hi> his good ſubjects in America, as he doth the people of Britain aſſembled in parliament, for money to defray the charges of government, I am bold to ſay they would readily grant it.</p>
            <p>Altho' the privilege of trial by juries is not as yet ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away from the colonies in general; yet the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of it is much leſſened in the province of the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts-Bay; as it is in the power of the ſheriff to pack ſuch a jury as he pleaſes; who being appointed <hi>ſolely</hi> by the governor, it may be preſumed will ever be a <hi>creature</hi> of his; and alſo by the governor's having power to remove capital trials out of the province, or even to Britain, where a jury cannot be ſuppoſed ſo a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dequate judges, as one collected from the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood where the crime was committed. The admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty courts, 'tis complained of, are in many caſes an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringment upon this important privilege. In Canada trial by juries is wholly taken away; and who but juſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fears that this is a ſample by which the other colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies may e're long be modelled.</p>
            <p>The late acts reſpecting the province of the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts-Bay are looked upon by Americans to be <hi>grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ous</hi> in many reſpects; to that province immediately; to the other colonies as they afford a precedent of the treatment they may expect to receive, whenever they ſhall happen to fall under the reſentment of the Britiſh court, and as it opens to view the adopted plan for the government of the colonies. To begin with that called the <hi>port act,</hi> or the act for blocking up the harbour of the town of Boſton.</p>
            <p>And firſt, if we look into the preamble of this act, we ſhall find the reaſons aſſigned are, that <hi>divers ill affected perſons have fomented and raiſed dangerous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>in which certain valuable cargoes of tea were deſtroyed.</hi>" h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>e you ſee 'tis ſuppoſed that the whole people are not guilty, but only <hi>divers ill affected perſons,</hi> yet the whole town is puniſhed, <hi>men, women, and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren.</hi>
               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:013614_0058_0F905B7A4866AA50"/>
Why did not the parliament enable his majeſty to puniſh thoſe <hi>ill affected perſons,</hi> and not bring ruin on a whole country for the crime of a few individuals? 'Tis not probable that more than a hundredth part of the inhabitants of Boſton were concerned in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, yet this is the only reaſon aſſigned for puniſhing the whole. Is it not the part of juſtice to ſever between the guilty and the innocent and not to puniſh all in the lump? And have not other colonies been guilty of the like conduct? New-York deſtroyed a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable quantity of the ſame tea. Philadelphia forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly ſent back a large cargo to the great detriment of the Eaſt-India company; yet Boſton only is ſingled out to be the object of miniſterial vengeance. It plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears they mean to take but <hi>one</hi> at a time, and thus by dividing the colonies to bring them one after another to ſubmit to the yoke.</p>
            <p>Again, if you look further into this monſtrous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction, you will find that all the immenſe eſtates lying in wharves, water lots, &amp;c. clear round Boſton bay are really <hi>confiscated</hi> to the king: for if ever ſatisfaction is made according to the requirements of the act, 'tis ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly left with the king, to licenſe only ſuch wharves and landing places as he pleaſes. Now wharves are worth nothing, if there may be no landing upon them: their water lots are worth very little, if they may not build wharves upon them; or may not uſe them when built. So that the property of theſe eſtates, all in a manner that is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable in them, is wreſted from the original owners and veſted with the king: With equal right might the parliament to vote the king the landed eſtate of any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in this or any other province: And if becauſe there hath been a riot or miſchief done by ſome individuals, the parliament may vote to the king the eſtate of any perſon that happens to lie in the town or country where committed: In what a dreadful ſituation are we? Here is not only claimed, but actually exerciſed; not mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:013614_0059_0F905B7AEAD86DF8"/>
a right of taxation, but of granting our eſtates, juſt as the Britiſh parliament pleaſes. A precedent juſtly alarming to all the colonies!</p>
            <p>If you look ſtill further into this oppreſſive act, you will find it inforced by ſuch penalties as never act was. If any goods are landed or ſhipped from any wharf or landing-place within Boſton bay; not only the veſſel and cargoes, with all the horſes, carriages, cattle and and every utenſil concerned in carrying them are for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit; but a fine treble the value of the goods at the higheſt price is laid upon any perſon that ſhall be ſo much as aiding or abetting. What ſhocking ſeverity! And where are theſe fines to be recovered? Not in the common courts of juſtice where there might be a fair trial by jury: but in the courts of admiralty; where the king, who is to receive the fine, is both judge and jury, as well as party concerned. And the difficulties every veſſel is laid under that goes in with proviſions, ſeem as if deſigned, if not to ſtarve them, at leaſt to raiſe the price of proviſions ſo high, as to force them to yield. And leſt the officers on the coaſt ſhould have ſome humane and compaſſionate feelings towards their diſtreſſed fellow ſubjects in Boſton; a fine of 500<hi>l.</hi> ſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling is laid on any one that ſhall ſo much as connive at the leaſt breach of the act.</p>
            <p>Again 'tis put out of the power of parliament to grant redreſs to Boſton: 'tis lodged with the king when to remove the rigours of the act: yet he is reſtricted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>

And not only ſo, but till the governor certifies ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction hath been made to the cuſtom-houſe officers
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:013614_0061_0F905B7C571A8530"/>
and others for all the abuſes they have received for ſeveral months before. Now how is it poſſible to know when they have complied with the requirements of the act? Let them be ever ſo much diſpoſed to make ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction, no mortal can tell when it is done. They are left wholly at the mercy of their governor; who by office, if not by inclination (as one expreſſes it) is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be a mere tool of arbitrary power. Never was there a completer inſtrument of tyranny, (if any are wicked enough to make ſuch an uſe of it) than the Boſton port act.</p>
            <p>And over and above all this, this act which brings ſuch an heavy calamity upon the town of Boſton and the whole province, and eſtabliſhes ſuch a fatal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent with reſpect to the parliament's power over the colonies, was paſſed without ever allowing the party therein concerned, an opportunity to make their defence, or even ſo much as their agents to ſpeak in their behalf; and when (as has been often reported) full ſatisfaction was offered by the merchants in London for all damage the Eaſt-India company had ſuffered from the deſtroying of their tea.</p>
            <p>"Here the ſons of tyranny in America; the baſe advocates for parliamentary power; may ſee the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed fruit of their doctrine: may ſee a ſpecimen of what the other Colonies may expect from that exorbitant power they are at ſuch pains to juſtify." Strange that any ſhould dare to hold up their heads among a free people in defence of ſuch oppreſſive claims, as are here exerted.</p>
            <p>But let us attend to the other late acts reſpecting the province of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay; both of which were hurried thro' the parliament with the utmoſt pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitancy, without ever allowing the province con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned an opportunity to ſpeak in their own behalf. One of theſe in open defiance of the royal charter, in which the word of the king moſt ſolemnly given had guaranteed to them that form of government, they had
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:013614_0062_0F905B7D180E0CF0"/>
enjoyed for near a century paſt, eſſentially changes their form of government,—veſts the king with a power of appointing another branch of their legiſlature beſide the governor.—Extends the power of the governor to the moſt exorbitant lengths, and almoſt nullifies that birth right of Engliſhmen, trials by jury, If charters, if the ſolemn promiſes of kings are to be thus trifled with, what ſecurity can we have in any thing? Under the faith of charters ſolemnly given, our fathers plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this wilderneſs; built towns and cities—extended the commerce, the power, the glory of Britain. But now theſe ſacred privileges thus ſolemnly confirmed are to be ſubject to the caprice of an inſolent miniſter. And then the principle upon which the parliament avowedly proceeded, that whenever they judged it expedient &amp; advantageous to the public, they had a right to ſet chart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers aſide, greatly aggravates the evil. For upon this principle, if they judge it expedient, they may ſet aſide all grants of land, all patents from the king (for none of theſe are more ſolemn <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> ſacred than charters) and thus might cauſe all our lands to revert into the hands of the king. This principle nullifies all ſecurity of our property. In ſhort, upon this principle the parliament may in the plenitude of their power, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive us of every valuable enjoyment we poſſeſs.</p>
            <p>The other act, which allows the governor to remove capital trials out of the province even to England, ſeems calculated with a moſt barefaced deſign to ſcreen the ſoldiers and cuſtom-houſe officers from puniſhment, when they ſhould be guilty of any exceſſes. As tho' a mercileſs ſoldiery and thoſe harpies and blood-ſuckers the officers of the cuſtoms would not be rigorous enough in executing theſe arbitrary laws, without a promiſe of impunity. For who would run the riſk to croſs the atlantic, more than 3000 miles to carry on a proſecuti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on againſt them? Or if adventrous end, how would it be poſſible to procure evidence? The language of it therefore is nearly this, let the ſoldiers commit what murders they pleaſe, they ſhall be liable to no puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment therefor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="66" facs="unknown:013614_0063_0F905B7E836BEA60"/>Think now what dreadful ſituation a people muſt be in, with an army of ſoldiers quartered among them; with another army of tax-gatherers encamped in all their trading places: both of which know they are ſent for the expreſs purpoſe of bearing down and humbling the people; and that to encourage them in their inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, they have the greateſt proſpect of impunity, let them commit what crimes they pleaſe. Theſe natural<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inſolent when under every reſtraint the civil autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity can put them, what may it be expected they will be, when theſe reſtraints are taken away, and they as it were invited to be inſolent and overbearing to the people? What hopes of redreſs can a people entertain, let them be injured ever ſo much? Let individuals in Boſton be allowed as wicked as any are diſpoſed to make them; yet ſurely the people have reaſon to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of theſe acts, which inflict a puniſhment ſo far exceeding the crime; involve the innocent with the guilty, and are ſuch complete engines of tyranny in the hands of any that ſhall be wicked enough to improve them as ſuch.</p>
            <p>Again the <hi>Quebec government act</hi> the colonies have juſt reaſon to complain of. Firſt as it eſtabliſhes the <hi>popiſh</hi> religion: by the articles of capitulation the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Canada were indeed to have a toleration, but not an eſtabliſhment. But <hi>popery</hi> is now eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, tythes are collected by law for it's ſupport; which ſhews ſuch a diſregard for the <hi>proteſtant</hi> religion as we never ſhould expect in the reign of one of the houſe of <hi>Hanover,</hi> who were called to the Britiſh throne to be guardians of the proteſtant religion. And tho' there are thouſands of Engliſh ſettled in that province, yet no proviſion is made for the ſupport of a proteſtant clergy; there is only a reſerve, that the king may make ſuch proviſion, if he ſees fit. Now when ſuch favour is ſhewn to the bloody religion of Rome, it argues ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a <hi>favourable</hi> diſpoſition in the parliament towards that religion; or that it is done, in order to carry on ſome other <hi>favorite</hi> ſcheme. Again trials by juries are
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:013614_0064_0F905B7E9FA1AFD0"/>
aboliſhed by this act: which is injurious, at leaſt to the Engliſh inhabitants, who under the faith of a royal proclamation, promiſing Engliſh privileges have ſettled there. As the government of Canada is now entirely after the model of the arbitrary government of France, 'tis to be feared this is deſigned as a precedent for what is to be done in the other colonies; or at leaſt we may ſuppoſe, without much conjecture, that the French in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Canada are gratified with an eſtabliſhment of <hi>popery</hi> and a reſtoration of their former laws; to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage them to be <hi>true</hi> to the miniſtry in any future ſtruggles with the colonies: A military government is continued there; that they may always have a good body of troops at hand, to join the Canadians and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians to pour down upon the back of us, if the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry ſhould find occaſion to uſe them. And that this <hi>French</hi> arbitrary government may take in as much of America as poſſible, it's limits are extended ſouthward to the O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hio, and weſtward to the Miſſiſippi: ſo that it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehends an extent of teritory almoſt as large as all the other provinces. When this vaſt extent of territory comes to be filled up with inhabitants, near half Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica will be under this arbitrary <hi>French</hi> government. So that upon the whole the Quebec act doubtleſs wears as threatning an aſpect upon Americans as any act that hath been paſſed by the Britiſh parliament. Thus I have hinted to you ſome of the principal grievances which the Americans judge they labour under from the <hi>late</hi> acts of the Britiſh parliament.</p>
            <p>Indulge me a little longer while I endeavour to point out what we have <hi>juſt</hi> reaſon to fear the conſequences of theſe meaſures will be. If we view the whole of the conduct of the miniſtry and parliament, I do not ſee how any one can doubt but that there is a ſettled fix'd plan for <hi>inſlaving</hi> the colonies, or bringing them under arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry government, and indeed the nation too. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent parliament have ever been (by all accounts) more devoted to the intereſt of the miniſtry, than perhaps e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a parliament were. Now notwithſtanding the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:013614_0065_0F905B7F9065A990"/>
of the Britiſh conſtitution, if the miniſtry can ſecure a majority in parliament, who will come into all their meaſures, will vote as they bid them; they may rule as abſolutely as they do in <hi>France</hi> or <hi>Spain,</hi> yea as in <hi>Turkey</hi> or <hi>India</hi>: And this ſeems to be the preſent plan to ſecure a majority of parliament, and thus enſlave the nation with their own conſent. The more places or penſions the miniſtry have in their gift; the more eaſily can they <hi>bribe</hi> a majority of parliament, by beſtowing thoſe places on them or their friends. This makes them erect ſo many new and unneceſſary offices in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, even ſo as to ſwallow up the whole of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue. The king is not at all the richer for theſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. But then by beſtowing theſe places—places of conſiderable profit and no labour, upon the children or friends, or dependants of the members of parliament, the miniſtry can ſecure them in their intereſt. This doubtleſs i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the great thing the miniſtry are driving at, to eſtabliſh arbitrary government with the conſent of parliament: And to keep the people of England ſtill, the firſt exertions of this power are upon the colonies. If the parliament inſiſt upon the right of taxing the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies at pleaſure, the leaſt we can expect is, to be tax'd as heavily as we can poſſibly bear, and yet ſupport our lives; for as the members of parliament feel no burdens themſelves by what they lay upon us, and are under no danger of loſing their places by tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us, ſo long as they can perſuade the people of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land they are lightening their burdens thereby; they are under no motives at intereſt to abſtain from loading us with taxes as heavy as we can poſſibly groan under. Doubtleſs they will be cautious enough, to introduce theſe heavy taxes gradually, leſt they excite too great commotions in this country: But let the <hi>right</hi> be once fix'd and eſtabliſhed; it will be very eaſy to keep ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding tax to tax; till the loads grow ſo heavy and are ſo faſt bound, that we can never ſhake them off. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing moſt certainly but a principle of juſtice will keep them from it; and what can we expect from this quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:013614_0066_0F905B80128B3140"/>
when in open defiance of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> conſtitution, they claim a right to tax us, and thus deprive us of our deareſt privileges?</p>
            <p>In the mean time we muſt expect our <hi>charters</hi> will fall a ſacrifice to theſe arbitrary claims. Charter governments have long been diſagreable to the powers in Britain. The <hi>free</hi> conſtitution of theſe colonies makes them ſuch nurſeries of freemen as cannot fail to alarm an arbitrary miniſtry. They only wait a favourable opportunity to aboliſh their charters, as they have done that of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay. We know the principle the parliament have adopted and openly profeſs to act upon, that they have a right to alter or annihilate charters when they judge it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient: And we may depend upon it, whenever they ſhall think it can be done without raiſing too great commotions in the colonies, they will judge it conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. Some may imagine it was the deſtroying the tea induced the parliament to change the government of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay. If it was, ſurely 'tis very extraordinary to puniſh a whole province and their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity thro' all ages, for the conduct of a few indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals. How ſoon will a roit or ſome diſorder of a few individuals, afford them a pretext for the like treatment of all the other charter governments. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, however, it may be made very evident, that the deſtroying the tea was not the reaſon for altering the goverment of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay; but that it was a fix'd plan long before, and they only waited a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lourable pretext for carrying it into execution. It has been reported by gentlemen of unqueſtionable veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that they had inconteſtible evidence that the two bills for altering the government of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay were ordered by the council to be drawn up by the crown lawyers more than two years ago. Now if this be true (as it undoubtedly is) 'tis quite certain the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry were only waiting for ſome colourable pretext for carrying their deſign into execution. The char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter governments are by this precedent reduced not
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:013614_0067_0F905B8321182EE8"/>
merely to the greateſt uncertainty of the continuance of their charters; but may be quite certain, it the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent plan is proſecuted, they will be taken away, and theſe colonies reduced, (if nothing worſe) to the ſtate of the royal governments; their governors, councils, judges, &amp;c. will be appointed from England, with high and extravagant ſalaries.</p>
            <p>There is great reaſon to fear the next ſtep will be the vacating all grants and patents of land from the king; that all our landed property may revert to his majeſty; to be regranted under ſuch <hi>quit rents and ſervices</hi> as thoſe in power ſhall ſee fit to impoſe: Nor will <hi>this fear</hi> appear chimerical to any one that duly conſiders what hath been already done, and what the plan is, which the miniſtry are doubtleſs purſuing. 'Twould be weak policy indeed for an arbitrary mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry to puſh with all their horns at firſt. But cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it doth not require very great ſagacity to ſee that their meaſures are tending to this. When it was reſolved to introduce arbitrary and deſpotic govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment into the colonies in the reign of king JAMES 2d. when Sir <hi>Edmond Androſs</hi> was governor of New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; the <hi>firſt</hi> ſtep was to vacate the charters; the very <hi>next</hi> to revoke the grants of land that had been made:<note n="‖" place="bottom">The charter being vacated, the people were told that their titles to their eſtates were of no value. The expreſſion in vogue was, that "the calf died in the cow's belly." "The fees for the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents varied according to circumſtances both of perſons and eſtates. In the complaint to king James, it is alleged that the ſees of ſome amounted to 50l. Prudence was uſed. Men's titles were not queſtioned all at once. Had this been the caſe according to the computation then made, all the perſonal eſtates in the colony, would not have paid the charge of the new patents." <bibl>
                     <hi>Gov. Hutchinſon's Hiſt. Maſ. vol,</hi> i. <hi>p.</hi> 359.</bibl>
               </note> which was done, in his ſhort adminiſtration in a great number of inſtances; and people were obliged to take out <hi>new</hi> patents at a moſt exorbitant price. We ſee our charters are already ſtruck at; a claim is advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the parliament to diſſolve them at pleaſure: And what is there more ſacred in grants of land, than in charters; that the former may not be annulled with as
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:013614_0068_0F905B84877A1000"/>
much right as the latter. Our fathers when they planted this wilderneſs, placed equal confidence in the royal word pledged in their charters; as in the patents by which they held their land: and deemed the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges granted in the former of as much worth; as the property granted by the latter. The principle upon which the parliament proceeded in vacating the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts charter; will equally warrant them, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſhall ſee fit, to vacate all our grants of lands, i. e. when they ſhall judge it expedient, or for the good of the nation. If the parliament ſhould once take it into their wiſe heads, that it is expedient, or for the general good, that all lands in America ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to the crown, that they may be regranted all upon the ſame tenure,—upon large <hi>quit-rents</hi> to defray the charges of government; what will hinder their car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying it into execution? And indeed the Boſton <hi>port act</hi> doth actually afford us a precedent of the exerciſe of this power: all their wharves and water-lots round the whole of Boſton bay, are really <hi>confiſcated</hi> to the king (as we have already ſhewn.) Now what is this but a vote of parliament to take away our landed pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty. And that power which hath been once exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed have we not all reaſon to fear will be exerciſed again.</p>
            <p>And have we not juſt grounds to fear that all this will not be the completion of their oppreſſive plan, if the miniſtry find themſelves ſucceſsful in their firſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts? By the <hi>Quebec-Act</hi> we find the parliament claim a power to eſtabliſh in <hi>America,</hi> the ſame arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry government that takes place in <hi>France.</hi>—To take away trials by juries:—to ſet aſide general aſſemblies: —to veſt the king with a power to appoint legiſlative councils &amp;c. Now this act not only reſpects the <hi>French</hi> inhabitants (who having been long uſed to ſlaviſh ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and not knowing the benefit of any other form of government, are poſſibly well eno' pleaſed with it, eſpecially as the pill is gilded over with a full eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of that religion, of which they are ſuch bigotted
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:013614_0069_0F905B84A0A037F8"/>
profeſſors;) but it reſpects thouſands of <hi>Engliſh,</hi> who have ſettled there ſince the conqueſt, and all ſuch as may ſettle any where within that vaſt extended pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince in future time. By the ſame right they could eſtabliſh this form of government over the <hi>Engliſh</hi> in Canada; they may do it in the other provinces. In the province of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, the important privilege of being tried by a jury, is greatly <hi>leſſened</hi> by ſetting aſide the equitable and impartial method by which juries were wont to be panel'd. Viewing the things that have taken place, is it without foundation that I expreſs my fears, that the Britiſh miniſtry will e'er long find our general aſſemblies troubleſome things?—a hindrance to government and the like, and ſo ſet them aſide, under a notion of their being <hi>inexpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient,</hi> and lodge the whole legiſlative power in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil appointed by the king. This is the very thing that took place in <hi>Sir Edmond</hi>'s time. The whole legiſlative power was lodged in him and his council. And ſince the previous ſteps are ſo like what took place then, why may we not expect the conſequent ones will be ſo too? And very likely the miniſtry may find <hi>juries</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually a bar to the government they mean to eſtabliſh: and ſo may perſuade the parliament, on the footing of expediency to aboliſh them likewiſe.</p>
            <p>And when our civil rights and privileges ſhall have thus fallen a ſacrifice to tyranny and oppreſſion, our religious liberties cannot long ſurvive: for where hath it ever been known that civil and eccleſiaſtical tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and deſpotiſm have not yet gone hand in hand to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. The latter is ſo neceſſary to uphold and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the former, that arbitrary princes or miniſters of ſtate have ever found their intereſt in the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. And ſhould America be forced to yield in the preſent ſtruggle for civil liberty, we have no reaſon to expect but eccleſiaſtical tyranny, in ſome ſhape or other, will like a mighty torrent overſpread our land. Thoſe princes on the Britiſh throne ſince the reformation, who have been moſt diſpoſed to trample
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:013614_0070_0F905B8552F93550"/>
upon the rights of the people, and to rule in an arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and deſpotic manner; have ever careſſed the papiſts and ſhewn a favourable diſpoſition towards the bloody religion of Rome, as that religion is the ſureſt prop to tyranny and deſpotiſm. This is evident during the reigns of all the ſeveral kings of the houſe of <hi>Stewart.</hi> Papiſts ſhared in the royal favour and were ſheltered under royal protection. Continual attempts were made to bring the church of England to a greater conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the deſpotic church of Rome; 'till James 2d. more adventrous than his predeceſſors boldly attempts to ſubvert the conſtitution both in ſtate and in church; —to introduce both tyranny and popery: which ſo alarmed the nation that they dethroned the tyrant; and placed a confirmed proteſtant on the Britiſh throne. Some late tranſactions ſhew a very favourable diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the preſent miniſtry and parliament towards the religion of Rome; how far they may attempt to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce into the Engliſh nation both in Britain and the colonies, God only knows. But thus much we may ſafely gueſs, without much danger of erring, that to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce epiſcopacy with all thoſe formidable powers with which it was clothed (which indeed were no obſcure reſemblance of the church of Rome) before the acts of parliament reſtraining and regulating prelative power and eccleſiaſtical courts, paſſed in conſequence of the revolution, will be a darling object with the preſent miniſtry, if they ſee a proſpect of being able to carry their deſigns into execution. For eccleſiaſtical go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment muſt be conformed to the civil, and nothing ſhort of this would be in any meaſure ſuited to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius of that civil policy they are evidently aiming to eſtabliſh in the colonies.

            <p>View now the ſituation of America: loaded with taxes from the Britiſh parliament, as heavy as ſhe can poſſibly ſupport under,—our lands charged with the moſt exorbitant quit rents,—theſe taxes collected by foreigners, ſteeled againſt any impreſſions from our groans or complaints, with all the rapaciouſneſs of Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man publicans—our charters taken away—our aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies annihilated,—governors and councils, appointed by royal authority without any concurrence of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, enacting ſuch laws as their ſovereign pleaſure ſhall dictate—judges appointed from the ſame ſource, without any check from juries carrying their arbitrary laws into execution.—the lives and property of Americans en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely at the diſpoſal of officers more than three thouſand miles removed from any power to controul them—ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of ſoldiers quartered among the inhabitants, who know the horrid purpoſe for which they are ſtationed, in the colonies,—to ſubjugate and bear down the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants—who know what a chance they ſtand for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>punity, tho' they commit the greateſt exceſſes.

               </gap> his neareſt friends and neighbours. To ſuch a dreadful ſtate as this, my countrymen, the preſent mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures ſeem to be ſwiftly advancing. What free-born Engliſhman can view ſuch a ſtate of abject ſlavery as this, tho' at the greateſt diſtance, without having his blood boil with indignation?</p>
            <p>Some perhaps may be ready to think the iſſue of theſe meaſures cannot be ſo bad as has been deſcribed. No wonder men uſed to freedom cannot at once realize all the horrors of ſlavery. But this is no worſe a ſtate, than what now actually takes place in a great part of the world: and why will not the ſame government pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſame effects in America?</p>
            <p>Others may think the Britiſh miniſtry cannot have ſo bad a ſcheme as this in view, that officers appointed by the crown cannot be ſo cruel and barbarous as hath been repreſented. Probably the miniſtry mayn't have it all in view at preſent<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> probably theſe officers would not at firſt be ſo cruel and barbarous, but there is no telling what men will ſoon become when entruſted with arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary power: ſuch power will more ſurely intoxicate men than the ſtrongeſt ſpirits: the beſt of men cannot be ſafely truſted with it. Many men amiable in private life have become monſters of cruelty when entruſted with arbitrary power: ſuch were many of the Roman emperors. Should governors and councils appointed by the crown be entruſted with legiſlative power over the colonies, and be ſupported by armies of ſoldiers quartered among the people, I ſee not what (according to the ordinary courſe of things) would keep them from even greater exceſſes than I have mentioned.</p>
            <p>Or ſhould the colonies refuſe to receive the chains

prepared for them, and the preſent meaſures iſſue in a hoſtile rupture between Great Britain and the colonies, which God forbid, and which I wiſh the miniſtry may not have in view to promote, ſee what precautions they have early taken either to ruin us, or force us to ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. To the Canadians who have been long inured to arbitrary government, and ſo are become fit tools for inſlaving others, they have granted an eſtabliſhment of their religion, the reſtoration of their former laws, &amp;c. to attach them to their intereſt:—have continued Canada a military government that they may have ſtore of forces at hand; that they may let looſe theſe with all the force of Canada and all the northern tribes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians upon our expoſed and helpleſs frontiers. What elſe can they have in view in trying ſo much to gratify the French inhabitants of that province?</p>
            <p>Now if the Britiſh parliament and miniſtry continue reſolved to proſecute the meaſures they have entered upon, it ſeems we muſt either ſubmit to ſuch a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſtate of ſlavery as hath been ſhewn will be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable iſſue of their meaſures, or muſt by force and arms ſtand up in defence of our liberties. The thoughts of either of which is enough to make our blood recoil with horror. Can any perſon ſurvey the events that have taken place, and yet remain ſo ſtupid as not to be ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the dreadful proſpect before us? Is there a wretch ſo unfeeling, as not to feel grieved and affected at the injured and violated liberties of America? Is there that tool of arbitrary power among the free-born ſons of America, that will dare hold up his head in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of ſuch meaſures as theſe? If there be any ſuch, I am ſure I cannot find it in my heart to wiſh them worſe, than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I will very briefly touch upon the laſt thing pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed viz. what can be done by us in ſuch an alarming criſis.—Some perhaps may think me already too bold in ſpeaking thus freely of the acts of the moſt reſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble legiſlature in the Britiſh empire. But the more I conſider the ſhocking tendency of them, the more diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult I find it to reſtrain myſelf within the bounds of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency. —I am ſure however there is nothing <hi>treaſonable</hi> in feeling oppeſſion when oppreſſed—nor in groaning under the anguiſh of it—as yet I have done little more than expreſs this.—Surely it cannot be <hi>treaſon</hi> to feel our burdens and weep and mourn and pray on account of them. To pray to God for redreſs is certainly inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, and happy it is we have heaven to go to, tho' our prayers ſhould be denied oh earth. God hath once and again in anſwer to prayer wrought eminent deliverance for the oppreſſed. Remember how he delivered the Jews from Haman's curſed devices. Oft hath he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered his people of old;—oft the people of New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land;—this affords great encouragement to be fervent in our ſupplications to the throne of grace. <hi>The king's

heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water: he turneth it whitherſoever he will.</hi> But little will prayer avail us without unfeigned repentance and humiliation before God under the heavy frowns of his righteous providence. We have more reaſon to be afraid of the vice and wickedneſs that abounds among us, than of all the arms of Britain. Theſe give us reaſon to fear leſt we have not virtue enough to make uſe of the propereſt means of redreſs, and leſt heaven ſhould fight againſt us. Were a general reformation to take place I make no doubt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> heaven would find a way for our relief. The preſent alarming ſituation of things therefore loudly calls upon us to examine what ſins in particular have provoked heaven thus to come out in judgment againſt us; and perhaps there cannot be a better rule of deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining than to enquire what ſins theſe calamities are properly retributive of, and by this rule will not the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaving the poor <hi>Africans</hi> in the colonies ſtand forth in the front of the dreadful catalogue?

Our trade hath been principally with them;—our religion and manners are very ſimilar to theirs:—We originated mainly from the ſame anceſtors; moſt of our towns derived their firſt inhabitants from that province; the reſt are deſcended from anceſtors that left their native land for the ſame cauſe with the Maſſachuſetts planters: So that it will be to our laſting ſhame, if more back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to contribute to their relief, than other colonies much more remote, and under no ſuch ſpecial connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as we are.
