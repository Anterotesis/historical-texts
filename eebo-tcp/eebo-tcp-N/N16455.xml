            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE pious and honourable founder of this Lecture having aſſigned <hi>revealed religion</hi> as one of the ſubjects of inveſtigation, the deſign of the preſent diſcourſe is to conſider ſome of the principal evidences on which the truth of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation reſts. It muſt be obvious to every one who is acquainted with the ſubject, that a wide and extenſive field opens to view, and that to traverſe the ſeveral parts, muſt vaſtly exceed the limits of a ſingle diſcourſe.—Several able and worthy divines who have preceded me on this ſubject, have confined themſelves to ſome particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar branch of it. One diſcourſe was limited to this ſingle point, to prove that Jeſus of Nazareth was the promiſed Meſſiah<note n="*" place="bottom">By the Rev. Mr. Barnard of Marblehead.</note>. The ſole object of another, was to conſider that part of the evidence which ariſes from miracles<note n="†" place="bottom">By the Rev. Mr. Barnard of Salem.</note>—Others, who have
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:021142_0003_0FB2537274854448"/>alſo been eminent in their profeſſion, have taken a brief view of the ſeveral parts of this copious ſubject. I confeſs that the firſt of theſe methods has ſtruck me as beſt calculated to anſwer the deſign of the inſtitution. The internal evidence of chriſtianity ariſing from the peculiar excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of its doctrines and precepts, deſerves parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular attention. The exact accompliſhment of a vaſt variety of prophecies in the ſucceſſive pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of the world, many of which reſpect im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant events which fall within our own obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, affords a ſtrong and undeniable argument of the truth of revelation. The evidence ariſing from the miracles of Chriſt and his apoſtles, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever derided by ſome and miſunderſtood by others, will always have great weight with every unprejudiced mind.—Among the various incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtible proofs of our Saviour's miſſion, his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection from the dead, is the moſt intereſting and important. This is the grand baſis of the ſyſtem; the corner-ſtone on which the whole building reſts. For as St. Paul argues, if Chriſt be not riſen, our preaching is vain, and your faith is vain alſo<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Cor. 15. 14.</note>.—Infidels, aware of the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of this fact to the chriſtian faith, have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed much art and addreſs in attempting to overthrow it. Their objections however have paved the way for the fulleſt inveſtigation of the ſubject, and the truth has been ſet in a clear view. However it may have happened, this particular point has not been conſidered on this occaſion; which together with its magnitude and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance ſhall be my apology for paying ſome atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:021142_0004_0FB2537530B8F238"/>
That there was ſuch a perſon as Jeſus of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zareth, who appeared on the ſtage of human life more than ſeventeen hundred years ago, who delivered a ſyſtem of doctrines and laws, and performed a variety of wonderful works in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the truth of his miſſion, is a fact moſt clear and indiſputable.—In this reſpect the friends and enemies of chriſtianity are perfectly agreed. Celſus, Porphyry, Heriocles and Julian the apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate with other inveterate enemies of the chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an cauſe, are compelled to acknowledge this truth—Neither is there any diſpute with reſpect to the crucifixion of Jeſus Chriſt at Jeruſalem, in the reign of Tiberius Ceſar the Roman Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peror. The Jewiſh prieſts and rulers, who moſt ardently wiſhed to prevent the ſpread of chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, with ſubſequent hiſtorians bear the fulleſt teſtimony to this truth But the caſe is far other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe with reſpect to the reſurrection of our Lord. From the time that the Sanhedrim hired the Roman ſoldiers to declare that the diſciples ſtole away the body while they ſlept to the preſent day, various objections have been urged to inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidate the truth of this important fact. Before we proceed to a direct conſideration of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, it is neceſſary to make ſome obſervations on the nature of evidence in general, and that kind of evidence in particular, which might reaſonably be expected in atteſtation of a revelation from heaven.</p>
            <p>"Evidence is the clear manifeſtation of truth to the mind, producing a ready aſſent to it." Sometimes we diſcover truth by ſtrict mathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical demonſtration. From certain axioms or
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:021142_0005_0FB253810605A040"/>ſelf-evident principles we arrive by various gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations at other truths; ſo that where the whole proceſs is underſtood, there is no poſſibility of doubt. In this caſe, the premiſes are of ſuch a nature as to render us infallibly certain of the concluſion.—In other inſtances, our aſſent is grounded upon the <hi>teſtimony of our ſenſes.</hi> To this evidence St. John refers when he ſays, that which we have heard, which we have ſeen with our eyes, which we have looked upon, and our hands have handled of the word of life, declare we unto you<note n="*" place="bottom">1 John 1. 1.</note>. This is a kind of evidence moſt full and ſatisfactory, to which an appeal is always made, for the determination of the moſt intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and important affairs in life. To reject the teſtimony of our ſenſes would imply a groſs re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on the wiſdom and goodneſs of our cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ator. This would be to ſuppoſe that he has by the conſtitution of our nature ſubjected us to unavoidable deception.</p>
            <p>A third kind of evidence on which aſſent is grounded, is <hi>credible teſtimony,</hi> or the concurrent declaration of faithful witneſſes with reſpect to certain facts which have fallen within their cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizance. With this proof men admit the truth of all paſt tranſactions. All hiſtorical facts, from the beginning of the world to the preſent day, depend upon it. The adminiſtration of juſtice and the ſupport of civil government in the world, reſt upon this baſis. Without this kind of evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence a great part of the moſt uſeful knowledge muſt be given up. Upon this idea, as one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves, no ſort of diſcovery, no experiment or ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:021142_0006_0FB253890143BB00"/>which a man does not make himſelf, or ſee with his own eyes; nay nor any demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble truth which he did not demonſtrate himſelf is ever to be admitted or made uſe of, either by way of argument in diſcourſe, or as a premiſe in any demonſtration in order either to theory or practice. Every man muſt ſtand upon the baſis of his own proper knowledge without light or information, without hints or ſuggeſtions from others<note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Ditton.</note>.—It has been alledged by de ſtical writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that the external evidence of chriſtianity is diminiſhed by time, and that the very nature of probability is ſuch, that were it left to time itſelf, even that would wear it quite out. This repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation is altogether inadmiſſible: For though the minds of men may be much leſs affected with remote tranſactions than with thoſe which are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, a fact which has once been ſufficiently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſted always claims our belief, unleſs contrary evidence is adduced. For inſtance, it is now as firmly believed that Julius Ceſar was ſlain in the ſenate-houſe, as that General Montgomery fell before the walls of Quebec. If it was of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of credibility to be thus deſtroyed, all true hiſtory muſt by degrees degenerate into mere fable and faction. What is credible to day would perhaps be incredible to morrow. No real diſtinction could be left on this ſuppoſition between truth and falſhood, but we muſt be in a ſtate of endleſs fluctuation and uncertainty. The truth is, mankind have never been in doubt with regard to a multitude of paſt facts and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote tranſactions. Modern infidels who urge this caſe the ravages of time, have never pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:021142_0007_0FB2538BE78BEAA8"/>to doubt the ſurprizing victories of Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander the great, that the ancient Romans ſubdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the neighbouring nations, or that they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed and burnt the famous city of Carthage. In all caſes where chriſtianity is not concerned, they admit theſe ancient facts without the leaſt heſitation. It diſcovers extreme unfairneſs to receive this kind of proof in all other inſtances, and to reject it as applied to religion.</p>
            <p>A being of infinite wiſdom and goodneſs has been pleaſed to reſt the truth of revelation princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally on this kind of evidence. Chriſtianity makes no pretenſions to ſtrict demonſtration; neither are all men indulged the teſtimony of their own ſenſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; but thoſe important facts on which the truth of it depends, are atteſted by credible witneſſes; who had neither ability nor inclination to impoſe a falſhood upon the world, and whoſe whole character bears the marks of the ſtricteſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity. On this evidence chriſtians in all ages, have admitted the truth of our Saviour's reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, that moſt important fact which lies at the foundation of the whole ſyſtem. If agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the language of the text, God the father has declared Jeſus Chriſt to be his ſon, by raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him from the dead, no man can refuſe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the truth of <hi>his miſſion</hi> who believes the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of deity. It is impoſſible that any one who owns the truth of natural religion ſhould ſuppoſe, that a being of infinite wiſdom, goodneſs and veracity ſhould ever ſet his ſeal to a lie, or give the beſt credentials to an impoſtor.</p>
            <p>The way being now in ſome meaſurs prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, we proceed to conſider the ſeveral proofs of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:021142_0008_0FB25393906E40C8"/>the reality of our Saviour's reſurrection.—That HE to whom all power belongs, can with the utmoſt eaſe raiſe one from the dead, is a point too clear to be called in queſtion. However impoſſible ſuch an event may be to any ſecond cauſe, there is nothing in it which implies any abſurdity or contradiction. HE, whoſe creative hand gave exiſtence to unnumbered worlds, and to the various orders of creatures which inhabit them, and who eſtabliſhed all thoſe laws by which the general ſyſtem is governed, muſt infallibly have the ſupreme direction and controul—As the reſurrection of Chriſt was evidently a ſubject of ancient prophecy, and as he had frequently declared that he muſt ſuffer death and riſe again the third day, the Jewiſh rulers took the moſt effectual precautions to prevent any fraud.—They ſaid to Pilate, Sir we remember that this deceiver ſaid while he was yet alive, after three days I will riſe again; command therefore that the ſepulchre be made ſure till the third day, leſt his diſciples come by night and ſteal him away, and ſay unto the people, he is riſen from the dead. So the laſt error ſhall be worſe than the firſt. Pilate ſaid unto them, ye have a watch, go your way, make it as ſure as you can; ſo they went and made the ſepulchre ſure ſealing the ſtone and ſetting a watch<note n="*" place="bottom">Matthew 27. 63, 64.</note>. As the predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on had fixed the third day for his reſurrection, by having the dead body in their cuſtody till af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that day, they imagined they ſhould abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly defeat it, and know they had nothing to fear from it afterwards. Human policy could
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:021142_0009_0FB2539E9F534D68"/>not have adopted a more effectual method to prevent all fraud than that which was choſen by the Jewiſh rulers. The ſepulchre was hewed out of a ſolid rock, and delivered to a company of ſoldiers with orders from their officer to guard it. But what are guards and centinels againſt the power of almighty God! An angel of the Lord opened the ſepulchre, the guards ſaw him and became as dead men. Terrified at the earthquake, and the radiant appearance of this heavenly meſſenger, ſome of them pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently repaired to the city, and gave information to the chief prieſts and rulers, of thoſe things which had hapened. It ſeems highly probable from what followed, that the ſoldiers were actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al witneſſes of the reſurrection of Jeius. The deliberations of the Sanhedrim on this ſubject, and the meaſures which they took to ſuppreſs the ſtory, plainly ſuppoſe that the guard aſſured them of the reality of his reſurrection. Our Lord is indeed ſaid to have appeared <hi>firſt</hi> to Mary Magdalene. This declaration is perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conſiſtent with the idea that the ſoldiers law him when he came out of the tomb. For that could not ſo properly be called an appearance after the reſurrection, as the reſurrection itſelf.</p>
            <p>However this might be, our Lord ſhewed himſelf alive after his paſſion by many infallible proofs, being ſeen of his diſciples forty days<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 1. 3.</note>. Deiſtical writers have fondly repreſented the accounts which the ſeveral Evangeliſts have giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en of this important fact as being inconſiſtent
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:021142_0010_0FB253AFE7B54C68"/>with, and contradictory to, each other and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, not worthy of credit.—Though there may be ſome diſagreement, as to certain minute cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, yet their teſtimony to the ſect itſelf, is ſubſtantially the ſame. Their ſeveral relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are of ſuch a kind as to ſhew that there was no colluſion in the matter, nor any preconcerted plan with reſpect to their narration. Each one declared what he ſaw or heard in ſuch order as ſeemed moſt natural, and in a manner moſt ſimple and unadorned. Had the four Evange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſts, ſays one, written exactly in the ſame order, related only the ſame facts, reported only the ſame diſcourſes, and reported them in the ſame words, I doubt not but oar enemies would have cried out plain juggle and impoſture! How is it poſſible theſe writers ſhould have ſo exactly agreed in all theſe circumſtances, had they not concerted theſe matters together, and reſolved each to ſupport the others account; or if each ſucceeding writer had not taken his account from the former, whereby in ſtead of being four diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct witneſſes, they are in reality but one! And the objection from hence would have been ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger ſays he, than I have ſeen it drawn from any other article<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Chandler.</note>. Several writers of diſtinguiſhed abilities have conſidered, and compleatly refut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the objections drawn from the ſeeming incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency of the witneſſes. The plan ſuggeſted by Mr. Weſt is perhaps on the whole, moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>exceptionable. It is needleſs to recite particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly the mode which he has adopted. To ſave time, I muſt refer you to the work itſelf, and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:021142_0011_0FB253C3CD011DE8"/>proceed to conſider the number of witneſſes atteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this fact, their character their ſtedfaſt adherence to their declaration amidſt danger and death, &amp;c. Let us attend for a moment to the number of the witneſſes—Our Lord appeared to men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to the eleven Apoſtles at ſundry times; he aſcended in the preſence of an hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and St. Paul aſſures us that he was ſeen of more than five hundred brethren at once, the greater part of whom were alive when he wrote to the Corinthians, and who of courſe would have contradicted his account if it had not been true<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Corinthians 15. 6.</note>.—Now though it is ſcarcely poſſible that a <hi>ſingle perſon</hi> ſhould be deceived with reſpect to a fact which was an object of ſenſe, it is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether incredible that ſo large a number ſhould have been impoſed upon. Can any perſon be ſo ſceptical as to ſuppoſe that not one of the Apoſtles, not one of the hundred and twenty, or of the five hundred could tell what he ſaw, and heard and felt? It is not to be admitted that ſo many perſons would unite in reporting a falſhood, without the leaſt proſpect of any ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage If the apoſtles had deſigned to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe a falſhood upon the world, they would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have communicated the affair to ſo large a number, leſt amidſt ſuch a variety of diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, ſome ſhould have diſcovered the cheat. They muſt have recollected that of the ſmall number of twelve, one had proved a traitor, and that among ſo many as five or ſix hundred, it was hardly poſſible that all ſhould prove true to their truſt. Had they been impoſtors, this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:021142_0012_0FB253C939F032F8"/>circumſtance would infallibly have ruined their cauſe. No rational account can be given of the number of witneſſes but upon the idea that they were conſcious of their integrity, and knew the truth of the fact to which they bore teſtimony.</p>
            <p>As theſe witneſſes were abundantly ſufficient in number, to aſcertain the truth of any fact which fell within their cognizance, ſo their cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter was ſuch as to render their teſtimony highly credible.</p>
            <p>They were perſons of a fair, unblemiſhed cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and therefore could not wiſh to deceive mankind in their moſt important intereſts. Their writings plainly diſcover their piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God, as well as their benevolence to men. Conſcious of their integrity, they appeal to the omniſcient God for the truth of what they deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered to the world. We do not find any charge of immorality or wickedneſs brought againſt them by their moſt inveterate enemies. If they had been perſons of abandoned characters, the Jewiſh rulers would not have failed to have brought them to juſtice; but when they cited them before their tribunal, they accuſed them of nothing but preaching Jeſus and the reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So that malice itſelf can hardly indulge a ſuſpicion that they were liable to any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peachment. It cannot therefore be admitted, that they would ever have wiſhed to perſuade the world that Chriſt was raiſed, unleſs they knew the truth of the fact.—Further, they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the whole of their conduct to have been
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:021142_0013_0FB253D21C0B6D98"/>perſons of great plainneſs and ſimplicity. They were altogether unqualified to impoſe a falſhood upon the world, had they been wicked enough to have attempted it. "They had neither gifts of nature, nor advantages of education to lead a multitude, and to manage the paſſions of men." There is no appearance of art or addreſs in their teſtimony, but they declare in the moſt ſimple, unaffected manner thoſe things which they had ſeen and heard. They do not even attempt to conceal their own faults, but menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the utmoſt frankneſs their dullneſs of apprehenſion, their incredulity, their doubts and fears. They relate without the leaſt reſerve, the perfidy of Judas, the denial of Peter, and their total dereliction of their maſter in the hour of diſtreſs. Theſe are certain marks of fairneſs and impartiality, and ſerve to recommend their teſtimony to the belief of all men. However, though they had a large ſhare of ſimplicity, yet they were not ſuch weak and deluded mortals as ſome have repreſented, ſo as not to be certain of what they ſaw and heard. There is no appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of wild enthuſiaſm, or an overheated imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. There was nothing in their conduct which looked like fond credulity. They were extremely ſlow in admitting the truth of a fact, of which they had not the leaſt expectation. They enquired with care and attention as to the reality of it, and never publiſhed it to the world till they had the fulleſt ocular demonſtration. The incredulity of Thomas was carried to the greateſt exceſs, and was at length removed by the moſt invincible evidence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:021142_0014_0FB253D46BA278A0"/>
Though they were illiterate men, yet they were as capable as others, of judging of a plain mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of fact. By their former intimacy with Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus they could diſtinguiſh him from any other perſon.—When they ſaw him eat and drink be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, when they handled his body, and freely converſed with him for forty days, they muſt have been infallibly certain with reſpect to the identity of his perſon — So that on the whole, they could not have been impoſed upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, neither had they ability or diſpoſition to impole upon others.</p>
            <p>We are further to conſider their ſtedfaſt adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to their declaration amidſt danger and death. Soon after our Lord's aſcenſion, his apoſtles publiſhed his religion in the city of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem. They ceaſed not to declare the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cency of their maſter, and b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ldly charged his death upon the prieſts and rulers as a moſt inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man murder, No threateings were ſufficient to intimidate them. James one of the twelve, and Stephen, a man full of faith, and of the holy Ghoſt, ſoon fell ſacrifices to the rage of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Peter, one of the chief of the apoſtles, was committed to priſon and the time fixed for his execution. The reſt, nevertheleſs perſevered in their declaration, and ceaſed not to preach Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus and the reſurrection. While they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to every kind of indignity and contempt, from an unbelieving world, and death itſelf in the moſt tremendous forms, they never heſitated with reſpect to their teſtimony. We cannot, ſay they, but ſpeak the things which we have ſeen and heard. We are his witneſſes of theſe things,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:021142_0015_0FB253D98DE2BBB8"/>and ſo alſo is the holy Ghoſt, which God hath given to them that obey him<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 4, 20. 5, 32.</note>. Now though the ſufferings of the apoſtles do not immediately prove the truth of Chriſt's reſurrection, yet they are a good evidence of the ſincerity of their decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. There have indeed been inſtances where perſons have ſuffered cather than relinquiſh falſe and erroneous opinions. But the caſe is widely different where men die for the truth of a matter of fact which they had ſeen themſelves. "In doctrines, as Biſhop Sherlock obſerves, men are always liable to miſtake, and it is no reaſon for me to embrace another man's opinion becauſe I think him ſincere in it. But when a man reports to me an uncommon matter of fact, which is in its own nature an object of ſenſe, if I believe him not, it is not becauſe I doubt the teſtimony of his ſenſes, but merely becauſe I queſtion his truth and ſincerity. Since voluntary ſuffering for the truth is a good proof of ſincerity, the ſuffering of the apoſtles for the truth of Chriſt's reſurrection, is a powerful argument in ſupport of the reality of it. The apoſtles gave up their lives in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing teſtimony to the reſurrection of their maſter. It was always in their power to quit their evidence and ſave their lives. Even their bittereſt ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies required them only to be ſilent. Others have denied or aſſerted facts in hopes of ſaving their lives: but theſe men atteſt a fact at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of <hi>their</hi> lives which they might have ſaved by denying the truth. So that between crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals denying plain facts, and the apoſtles dying for their teſtimony there is this material difference.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:021142_0016_0FB253E1B4D5FC58"/>Criminals deny the truth in hopes of ſaving their lives, the apoſtles willingly parted with their lives rather than deny it."</p>
            <p>Once more, the gifts of the holy Ghoſt which were imparted to the apoſtles and others, are a ſubſtantial proof of our Lord's reſurrection. He aſſured them that they ſhould receive power to execute the work aſſigned them, that the holy Ghoſt ſhould come upon them, and that they ſhould be his witneſſes both in Jeruſalem and in all Judea, and to the uttermoſt parts of the earth<note n="*" place="bottom">Acts 1. 8.</note>. The ſacred hiſtorian aſſures us that this promiſe was fulfilled on the memorable day of Pentecoſt, when they received the gift of tongues and other miraculous powers neceſſary to ſupport the truth of their miſſion. Theſe powers began to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed at a publick feſtival in Jeruſalem, in the preſence of a vaſt multitude collected from all quarters. So that if theſe had not been real mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racles, there was every poſſible advantage for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection. Now as God himſelf bore them witneſs with divers ſigns and miracles and gifts of the holy Ghoſt, their declaration was entitled to the fulleſt credit. The apoſtle in our text refers to theſe miraculous gifts when he ſays that Chriſt was declared to be the ſon of God with power <hi>according to the ſpirit of holineſs, or the holy ſpirit.</hi> For though theſe miraculous powers did not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly prove the reſurrection of Jeſus, yet as they were agreeable to his own prediction, and beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the very time which he had preſcribed, as they were viſible manifeſtations of the power of
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:021142_0017_0FB253E2EF5EE078"/>God, it follows that the apoſtles either declared the truth, or elſe that God Almighty gave the higheſt poſſible atteſtation to a falſehood.—It has indeed often been ſuggeſted that evil ſpirits have a power of working miracles. But as the laws of nature are the eſtabliſhed rules of the divine go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and eſſential to the order and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the world, it cannot be rationally ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that God ever delegates to his creatures a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of controuling thoſe laws at their own pleaſure. It is altogether inadmiſſible that oppoſite beings ſhould in turn ſuſpend the laws of nature, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to ſupport different ſyſtems. "This would entirely deſtroy the credit of miracles as criterions of truth, and credentials of a divine miſſion. A God of truth can never bear an immediate teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to one as a divine meſſenger whom he has not ſent, or who publiſhes his own inventions as the oracles of heaven." He cannot conſiſtently with his wiſdom and benevolence, ever ſuffer any inferior beings by miraculous works to deceive his creatures. It muſt be added, that the rapid ſpread and propagation of the goſpel in the world, againſt the ſtrongeſt prejudices and the moſt violent oppoſition, ſerve to confirm the truth of Chriſt's reſurrection. The doctrines and precepts of chriſtianity were totally oppoſite to the principles and views of Jews and Gentiles. All parties were confederated againſt it, though upon different motives; and yet it ſpread and triumphed. Within twenty five years after the death of Chriſt many myriads of Jews believed in him; and in a few years after, the goſpel was propagated through all parts of the Roman em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire; and thus agreeably to our Lord's predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:021142_0018_0FB253EC31432908"/>being lifted up, he drew all men after him<note n="*" place="bottom">John 12. 32.</note>. Now that a few men deſtitute of all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages of birth and education, bred up amidſt the numerous prejudices and ſuperſtitions of their own nation, and engaged in the loweſt occupati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of life, ſhould in a few years, propagate the chriſtian religion in the world againſt the ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt prejudices, and the moſt violent oppoſition, is an event moſt aſtoniſhing, which never can be accounted for, but upon the idea that God was with them of a truth.</p>
            <p>It muſt indeed be acknowledged, that falſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligions have been propagated with ſucceſs. The Mahometan impoſture had a rapid progreſs, and ſtill exiſts in the world. But how was this ſyſtem propagated? Was it by its own internal excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and by ſuch proofs as are adapted to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford rational conviction to the minds of men? Was not this prophet arrayed in armor and blood, riding in triumph over thouſands and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands who fell by his victorious ſword? How many cities did he conſume! What an extent of country did he ravage and deſtroy! What wretchedneſs did he bring on the inhabitants of the earth! Were any ſuch unhallowed means adopted by Chriſt and his apoſtles! What a ſtriking contraſt is there between this fierce in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vader of the ſacred rights of mankind, and the benevolent, meek and humble Jeſus, who came not to deſtroy men's lives, but to ſave them; who went about doing good to the ſouls and bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of men, diſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>uſing happineſs in the family of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:021142_0019_0FB253F4CCF39CE0"/>God! Beſides, did not this artful impoſter adapt his religion as far as poſſible, to the luſts and paſſions of men? Did he not by his precepts and example juſtify thoſe practices to which mankind are extremely addicted? Did he not promiſe his votaries a paradiſe which ſhould give full ſcope to their unbridled appetites and inclinations?—The religion and example of Jeſus were totally oppoſite to this ſyſtem. Chriſtianity is levelled againſt all ungodlineſs and unrighteouſneſs of men. It inculcates every virtue which can adorn human nature, and aſſimilate it to the pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of perfection. The example of Chriſt was pure and ſpotleſs, calculated in every view to recommend and enforce that excellent religion which he taught. A compariſon of the nature of the chriſtian and mahometan ſyſtems and the mode of their propagation, muſt convince us that the argument drawn from the ſpread and actual exiſtence of the former, remains in full force. Theſe are ſome of the principal proofs on which the truth of our Saviour's reſurrection reſts. Several things have been alledged by the enemies of chriſtianity in one age and another to invali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date this evidence, which may deſerve notice.</p>
            <p>The Jewiſh rulers alarmed at the idea of his reſurrection and the probable conſequences of it, immediately took meaſures to prevent the belief of this important fact. They hired the ſoldiers to declare that the body was ſtolen away by the diſciples while they ſlept. This report, however improbable, has been believed by the Jews in all ages of the chriſtian Church No ſtory was ever fabricated more abſurd in itſelf. For men can
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:021142_0020_0FB253FE26CFF578"/>never ſay what is done while they are aſleep. If the diſciples had attempted to take away the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the guard knew it, they might with the utmoſt eaſe, have prevented it. If the body was taken away while they were aſleep, it was impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to ſay by whom it was done. Suppoſing they had been ſo regardleſs of their duty as to have fallen aſleep, any attempt to rob the ſepulchre muſt inſtantly have awaked them. The body was ſo depoſited that its removal could not be effected without conſiderable noiſe. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, the Evangeliſt aſſures us, that the burying clothes were left in ſuch order that there was no appearance of hurry and confuſion, but all the marks of leiſure and compoſure of mind.—It is extremely improbable that the diſciples of our Lord ſhould have attemped any thing of this kind. It does not appear that they had any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of his riſing again. When he was laid in the tomb, all their hopes of his being the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Meſſiah, were buried with him. It is therefore inconceivable that they ſhould have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived any account with reſpect to his reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. By ſtealing the body, they would have been guilty of a high offence, and liable to a heavy puniſhment, without the leaſt expectation of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port either from God or men in aſſerting the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, which on this ſuppoſition, they knew to be falſe. Beſides, if the Jewiſh rulers had believed this ſtory themſelves, and knew that there had been any colluſion with reſpect to the removal of the body, why was there no attempt to confront and deſtroy the teſtimony of the apoſtles? This would certainly have been an act
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:021142_0021_0FB2540881AB5A58"/>of juſtice to themſelves, and what they owed to their nation and to mankind.</p>
            <p>Is it poſſible that men in theſe circumſtances ſhould never have attempted any inveſtigation of the matter? Is not their ſilence a ſtrong pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive proof that they knew the reality of Chriſt's reſurrection?</p>
            <p>It has alſo been ſuggeſted by way of objection, that according to the account of the Evangeliſts, Chriſt was raiſed before the time fixed in the prediction. It muſt be obſerved that the words <hi>meta treis êmeras,</hi> after three days do not ſignify either in the nature of the thing, or in conſtant acceptation, the completion of three times twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty four hours. It is evident that the Scribes and Phariſees underſtood by the third day only the commencement of that day. They demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that a watch ſhould be ſet till the third day, which plainly ſhews that had Chriſt riſen on any part of that day to their conviction, they muſt have owned the accompliſhment of the prophecy. Our Lord was crucified and laid in the tomb on Friday; he continued there all Saturday, and early in the morning on what is now called the firſt day of the week, he aroſe; which according to Jewiſh phraſeology, was <hi>three days</hi> and <hi>three nights.</hi> We have a ſimilar inſtance of computa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in 1 Kings 12. 5. where Rehoboam ſays to the people, depart yet for three days and then come again, and yet all the people came to him the third day. In like manner, when the parents of Jeſus miſſed him on their return from Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, it is ſaid that they went back, and after three days, found him in the temple, i. e. the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:021142_0022_0FB25409AF784860"/>third day. For they miſſed him after the firſt day's journey, returned the ſecond day to the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and on the third day they found him in the temple. Joſephus, the Jewiſh hiſtorian, has a ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar expreſſion with reſpect to Iſaac, <hi>on eutheus met ogdocen êmeran peritemnouſi,</hi> i. e. the eighth day. So that the expreſſion in the prophecy exactly agrees with the event, when taken according to the uſe of language at that time.</p>
            <p>The laſt objection which I ſhall notice, is that which is derived from our Lord's not appearing to the body of the Jewiſh nation. Infidels ſay, that he promiſed ſuch an appearance, when he declared that no ſign ſhould be given, but the ſign of the prophet Jonas; and that as Jonas was a ſign to the Ninevites, ſo ſhould the ſon of man be to that generation<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 11. 29, 30.</note>. In reply to this it muſt be obſerved, that the prophecy never inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mated that he ſhould riſe in the preſence of the people or ſhew himſelf to the body of them, but only that ſufficient and proper evidence ſhould be exhibited of the truth of his reſurrection. Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nas was a ſign to the Ninevites, becauſe they had proper evidence of his miraculous deliverance, though none of them perhaps ſaw him when he was thrown out of the fiſh. The prophecy of Chriſt was alſo literally and exactly fulfilled when the truth of his reſurrection was atteſted by credible witneſſes The body of the Jewiſh na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion had no reaſon to expect that Chriſt would appear to them; for his particular commiſſion to that people terminated at his death, and he
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:021142_0023_0FB2541256CFF358"/>aſſured them that they ſhould ſee him no more till they were better diſpoſed to receive him<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke 13. 35.</note>. As the whole world was concerned in the truth of Chriſt's reſurrection, it was neceſſary that ſuch proof ſhould be exhibited as was adapted to the ſatisfaction of all men. Who could be ſo well qualified to be the witneſſes of this important fact, as thoſe who had been intimately conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant with him, who knew his form and air, his voice and manner: If our Lord had appeared publickly to the Jews, it is probable that ſome of them would have been convinced; others would no doubt have perſiſted in their infidelity; ſo that future generations muſt after all, have depended upon the evidence of thoſe very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who were appointed to be the witneſſes of his reſurrection. Inſtead of gaining any thing by his publick appearance, we muſt have truſted to the evidence of the diſciples, and this clogged with one incumbrance, viz. that ſome who ſaw him were not convinced. If the body of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh nation had been convinced by ſuch a publick appearance, this would not have been ſufficient to ſatisfy modern infidels. They could have no other evidence of the fact than teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and therefore according to their own ſyſtem, muſt continue in doubt. Perſons of this charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are not the more ready to admit the reality of the miracles of Moſes in Egypt and at the Red ſea, becauſe they were wrought before all the people. If the teſtimony of ſeveral hundreds of credible perſons who had the beſt poſſible opportunity for knowing the truth, and who were ready to
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:021142_0024_0FB25419822D4428"/>ſeal their declaration with their blood, is not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, there is no probability that an augmen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of their number to any amount whatſoever, would afford conviction. "If they hear not Moſes and the Prophets," Chriſt and his apoſtles, there is no probability that they would be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, "though one roſe from the dead" and appeared perſonally to every individual.—The time will not admit of enlarging any further, I will relieve your patience by concluding with ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on the doctrine which has been conſidered.</p>
            <p>If Chriſt has been <hi>declared to be the ſon of God with power by</hi> his reſurrection from the dead, then we may reſt aſſured that the chriſtian religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is of divine original. It is evident that "we have not followed cunningly—deviſed fables, and that our faith ſtands not in the wiſdom of men, but in the power of God." For ſurely the almighty and benevolent Father of all, would never have thus honoured an impoſtor and have given credit to his impious undertaking. This is the higheſt poſſible atteſtation which could ever be given to any meſſenger from heaven. So that he who doubts the divine miſſion of Jeſus Chriſt muſt either believe that it is within the reach of human power to raiſe the dead, or elſe that a being of all perfection has adopted the moſt effectual method to lead mankind into er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror and deluſion. The reſurrection of Jeſus is at once a ſtriking inſtance of two of the beſt kinds of evidence in ſupport of revelation; I mean miracles and prophecies. This was itſelf an illuſtrious miracle, far exceeding the limits of created power. It was alſo an exact fulfilment
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:021142_0025_0FB254200FFB7DE0"/>of expreſs predictions delivered by preceding prophets and by Chriſt himſelf. If therefore the proof of this fact is ſatisfactory to our minds, we cannot for a moment doubt the truth of the goſpel revelation; and if we admit this, the writings of Moſes and the Prophets cannot be diſcredited, becauſe they all refer ultimately to Chriſt, and were completely accompliſhed in him. The old and new Teſtaments are cloſely and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeperably connected, and muſt ſtand or fall toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.—Again, it follows, that while infidels are conſtantly charging Chriſtians with fond credu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, they themſelves have an uncommon ſhare of it. For ſince the Chriſtian religion has been propagated and ſtill exiſts in the world, upon their principles they muſt admit, that a few poor illiterate fiſhermen were able to contend with the prejudices of all the world, the ſuperſtition of the people, the intereſts of the prieſts, the pride of the philoſophers, the malice of the Jews, the learning of Greece and the power of Rome. They muſt believe alſo, that a number of the vileſt impoſtors that ever appeared in this world, have publiſhed the moſt excellent ſyſtem of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality which mankind was ever favoured with. They will be compelled to own, that theſe men ſubmitted to the moſt grievous ſufferings, and to death itſelf, in vindication of what they knew to be falſe, without the moſt diſtant proſpect of any reward whatſoever. Theſe and ſundry other things which might be mentioned, which undeniably follow from their principles, are totally oppoſite to the eſtabliſhed order of nature, and are facts as miraculous as any recorded in the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Further, it follows that the prevalence
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:021142_0026_0FB2542114AF4DA8"/>of infidelity is not owing to the want of evidence of the truth of our holy religion, but to ſome other cauſes. Under the continuance and progreſs of chriſtianity, its evidence has been growing and gathering ſtrength. The more thoroughly this ſyſtem has been canvaſſed, with the brighter luſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre does its evidence appear. 'The continual acceſſion of ſtrength from the exact accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of prophecies, of which in many inſtances, we have ocular demonſtration, is an overbalance for any ſuppoſed diminution, with reſpect to the proof ariſing from miracles. The want of the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of our ſenſes which the apoſtles and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive chriſtians had, is ſupplied by an increaſe of evidence of another kind, in the ſame manner (if the ſimilitude may be admitted,) that the loſs of luminous matter from the ſun is ſupplied by a communication of light from the fixed ſtars; or as other ſuppoſe, by abſorbing comets into it. The wiſdom and contrivance of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence being no leſs admirable in the moral, than the natural world; no leſs in the light which God gives us from and concerning the ſun of righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, than in the ſupply of that of the ſun in the firmament.'</p>
            <p>Deiſm oftentimes reſults from the pride of the human heart. Men who have a high ſenſe of their own abilities and philoſophical knowledge, are not willing to admit the truth of revelation, becauſe there are ſome things in it above hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man inveſtigation. They forget that natural re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion is liable to the ſame objection; and that philoſophy itſef, ſo far as it relates to the abſtract natures of things, is a ſcience full of arcana, which the utmoſt ſtretch of genius has hitherto been
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:021142_0027_0FB25423F57D6BA0"/>unable to diſcloſe. If theſe perſons are reſolved to believe nothing which they connot fully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, the being of God and his providence, together with their own exiſtence muſt be called in queſtion and all the phaenomena of nature whoſe cauſes have not been inveſtigated, muſt be peremptorily denied.</p>
            <p>It is very poſſible, that an affectation of cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage may in ſome inſtances, have betrayed men into infidelity. Some flatter themſelves that it is a ſure indication of courage to call in queſtion that which the world holds ſacred. A late au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor <note n="*" place="bottom">Biſhop Hurd.</note> remarks, that when the philoſopher of Malmſbury in the laſt century, reſolved all morality and religion into the will of the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, the bold ſingularity of the paradox was, no doubt, that which chiefly recommended it to himſelf, as well as ſurprized the world into an opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of his bravery; though we know from his ſtory that he had no more of this virtue, than might have conſiſted with faith and the fear of God. But vain man, ſays he, oft affects to make a ſhew of that which he does not poſſeſs, and thus his defect in true courage, may be the reaſon why he pretends to ſo much of it.</p>
            <p>It will hardly be thought a breach of charity to ſuppoſe, that many have rejected revelation on account of its oppoſition to their favorite vices: or in the language of our Savior, "that they love darkneſs rather than light becauſe their deeds are evil."</p>
            <p>Immerſed in worldly purſuits and ſenſual plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, men cannot endure the holy precepts of the New Teſtament. They ſecretly wiſh that there
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:021142_0028_0FB2542633206100"/>was not ſufficient evidence to ſupport this ſyſtem. When they come enqtire, ſmall objections thro' the force of prejudice, appear to them inſupera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and they are eaſily prevailed on to reject the goſpel. If they would with honeſt, imparti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al minds conſider the nature and deſign of the chriſtian inſtitution, and the evidence of the facts recorded in the New-Teſtament, they would preſently be ſatisfied of its truth. If they were ſeriouſly diſpoſed to practiſe the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of natural religion, the goſpel would appear to them "worthy of all acceptation."</p>
            <p>This literary ſociety, founded by the wiſdom of our anceſtors, has under the ſmiles of heaven been happily inſtumental of promoting the knowledge and belief of chriſtianity in our land. Many of its ſons have riſen to diſtinguiſhed eminence and uſefulneſs in church and ſtate, and their names will be tranſmitted with honor to the lateſt generations. May a noble emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion be excited in the breaſts of the ſtudents in this univerſity to exceed all who have gone be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them in intellectual and moral attainments. The diſtinguiſhing advantages which you now enjoy, the expectations of your friends and your country, as well as your preſent peace and future happineſs, all urge you to vigorous purſuit and unremitting application. While you ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance in the delightful paths of ſcience, and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey the wonders which modern philoſophy opens to your view, ever carry your thought up to the firſt cauſe, the original ſource of exiſtence. Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the weakneſs and imperfections of the human mind, and of the doubt and uncertainty of the beſt heathen philoſophers with reſpect to religious truths, receive the goſpel revelation
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:021142_0029_0FB25427A8B06D78"/>with gratitude and joy. Examire its evidence with candor and impartiality. Be not ſhaken in mind either by the ſophiſtical reaſonings or the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane banter of men of depraved hearts. Never indulge an idea that it is an argument of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs or fond credulity to admit the truth of reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. Many of the moſt diſtinguiſhed philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers which the world ever produced, have been firm believers in the chriſtian ſyſtem, and have done themſelves immortal honor by their writings in ſupport of it, and their dying teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony to it. Let all your ſearches after truth be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a temper and practice conforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the eternal and immutable rules of reaſon and religion. May you be trained up for emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſervice among the multitude of your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, and finally be qualified for that ſtate where every thing whith is myſterious and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligible ſhall be cleared up, and the whole in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual world be open to your view.</p>
            <p>Finally, with what unfeigned gratitude ſhould we all "bleſs the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who by his reſurrection from the dead, has begotten us to the lively hope of an inheritance incorruptible, undefiled, and that fadeth not away. Since "Chriſt is riſen as the firſt fruits of them that ſlept," we cannot doubt the truth and certainty of our own reſurrection. This is a noble diſcovery of revelation. May we be raiſed in our deſires and purſuits above all the vanities of this tranſitory life, and be "look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the bleſſed hope, and the glorious ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the great God and our Savior Jeſus Chriſt."</p>
