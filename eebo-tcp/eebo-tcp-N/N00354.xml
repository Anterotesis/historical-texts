            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

Nor is it any Disparagement unto men of a <hi>military</hi> Disposition or Improvement, that in all ages the most accomplisht of them, have been willing sometimes to make <hi>Books</hi> the entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their vacant hours: Even a mighty <hi>Alexander</hi> must have a <hi>Book</hi> under his pillow, or he cannot sleep.

of this <hi>Bookish Temper</hi> that this poor <hi>Sermon</hi> preached unto the <hi>Artillery</hi> of <hi>Middlesex,</hi> is by some Members of that wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy <hi>Company</hi> now desired to be printed; that their <hi>eyes</hi> may dwell upon those things which <hi>He who gives favour to them that are not men of Skill</hi> made not altogether unaccepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble unto their <hi>ears.</hi> It was a <hi>Souldier</hi> that found out the happy art of <hi>Printing</hi> at first; and it seems that <hi>Souldiers</hi> will now and then press the <hi>Press</hi> into their <hi>Service</hi> still.</p>
            <p>My Education among <hi>Libraries,</hi> my Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment only in such a <hi>Warfare</hi> as <hi>Timothy</hi> had recommended unto him, and my impatient Longings for the Revolution of a <hi>Golden Age</hi> wherein there shall be (as about the Time of our Lords first coming it is noted by the Roman Hist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orian that there was) <hi>Totius Orbis aut pax, aut pactio,</hi> a general <hi>Peace</hi> or <hi>Truce</hi> through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the whole world, have made me the unfittest of all men to read <hi>Military Lectures<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Aelian</hi>'s <hi>Tacticks</hi> shall stand in the <hi>Rore</hi> of my Authors, and will perhaps be left unstudied by me, till I have nothing else to do.

yet one that I never would care to be akin unto. But a <hi>Request</hi> from the Honoured Persons, at whose Invitation the ensuing <hi>Thoughts</hi> have been <hi>Spoken</hi> and <hi>Written,</hi> was a strong <hi>Sum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons</hi> not to be gainsaid by me, who ought to count <hi>Opportunities</hi> of <hi>doing Good</hi> among the best of all my <hi>Treasures.</hi> They asked me to lay before them their Dutyes, as farr as my <hi>Armory,</hi> the <hi>Bible,</hi> would inform me what they are: and I have with <hi>brief Hints</hi> attempted to let them know what those <hi>Words of Command</hi> are which come unto them back'd with a, <hi>Thus saith the LORD.</hi> They have also asked me to give them a Copy of those <hi>Words</hi> for the <hi>Publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of them; and I consider'd that this being all, my case was not so hard as that of the Expedition against <hi>Sisera,</hi> wherein out of <hi>Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulon</hi> were engaged <hi>they that handled the</hi> pen <hi>of the Writer,</hi> Gow<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Thousands of <hi>Praises,</hi> whole Ages of <hi>praises</hi> be given unto a good God, for the <hi>Abundance of peace</hi> wherein we in this Wilderness do delight our selves.

There is in these <hi>Oracles</hi> of God, a delicious Entertainment for the innumerable sorts of Readers to whom <hi>these presents come</hi>; and the Benefit of the <hi>Souldier</hi> particularly is not left unconsulted in them. The blessed <hi>Suitableness</hi> of this <hi>miraculous Book</hi> unto the Affayrs and Concerns of all men, is, to be found (as the Philosopher saith, of the <hi>Soul in the Body</hi>) in <hi>every part</hi> thereof; but the Book of <hi>Psalms</hi> (a <hi>Little Bible,</hi> as <hi>Luther</hi> styl'd it) in pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarwise, is so remarkable on this score, that it was no imprudence in old <hi>Jerom</hi> to bid his Friend make This his <hi>Vade mecum,</hi> his constant Companion, it was no folly in the holy Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nister of <hi>Constantinople</hi> being driven out of that City, to take no part of his Treasures but This, which was unto him <hi>pro et prae Divitiis,</hi> instead of and better than all the <hi>Riches</hi> of the World; the renouned <hi>Basil</hi> therefore very rightly recommended it as <hi>A Divine Treasure,</hi> and the eloquent <hi>Chrysostom</hi> no less appositely reputed it as, a <hi>Panoply for the Christian.</hi> From this <hi>Panoply,</hi> from this well-furnished <hi>Armory,</hi> give me leave to offer something for the Use of this <hi>Armed,</hi> and much honoured Auditory. For this cause the name which the Holy Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit <hi>in a certain place</hi> (in <hi>Col</hi> 3.16.) putteth upon these <hi>Psalms</hi> is that of <hi>spiritual Songs</hi>;
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000431_0009_0FA5B3F0FB27E7D8"/>
partly because the <hi>Spirits</hi> of men are most sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly <hi>suited</hi> therein: every man may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive, as <hi>Athanasius</hi> long ago observed, That they speak <hi>de se, in re sua,</hi> to his <hi>own case</hi> directly. Tis to be hoped that the <hi>Spirit</hi> of the <hi>Souldier</hi> especially will anon herein meet with what shall not be impertinent unto <hi>him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That inspired person, whoever he were, that <hi>marshalled</hi> the Psalms into the <hi>Method</hi> wherein we now enjoy them, seems to have had some respect unto the Affinity of <hi>Subjects</hi> therein handled, in his doing of it. Hence this Hundred-and-forty-fourth Psalm, with the rest unto the <hi>end</hi> of our Psalter, is employ'd in that business which we expect at the <hi>end</hi> of our pilgrimage to be put upon; even <hi>The magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the LORD JEHOVAH.</hi> The <hi>Penman</hi> of this Composure, is by the <hi>Title</hi> of it, deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to be <hi>David,</hi> the <hi>sweet singer of Israel.</hi> Indeed some passages of it are by <hi>Him</hi> again repeated in both h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

There is a divine <hi>Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> herein acknowledged, and the Twofold <hi>Subject</hi> of it is taken notice of. The Good man first declares the <hi>Subject</hi> which <hi>received</hi> this Teaching: This was his <hi>Hands</hi> &amp; his <hi>Fingers.</hi> These are by a <hi>Synecdoche</hi> put for not only all the <hi>Members</hi> of his body, but also all the <hi>Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers</hi> of his mind. These may be singled out, because there is a <hi>special Vse</hi> of these parts in all warly Encounters. There was so parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, first in <hi>Choosing</hi> and then in <hi>Casting</hi> the <hi>Stone</hi> which laid the <hi>Philistean</hi> Champi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on sprawling on the ground. In the <hi>Hands</hi> also <hi>Strength</hi> is seated, and <hi>Skill</hi> is shewed by the <hi>Fingers.</hi> So both of those Qualifications may herein be glanced at. The good Soul next declares the <hi>Subject</hi> which this Teaching was <hi>Occupy'd</hi> about: This was <hi>Warring</hi> and <hi>Fighting.</hi> The former Expression [<hi>Lakrob</hi>] comes from a Root that signifies to <hi>Draw near</hi>; the Latter [<hi>Lammilchama</hi>] comes from a Root that signifies to <hi>Eat up</hi>; because in War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Engagements, persons first <hi>Approach</hi> and then <hi>Devour</hi> one another.</p>
