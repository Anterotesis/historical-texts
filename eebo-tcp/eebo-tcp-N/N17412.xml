            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <bibl>PROVERBS, CHAP. 8, VERSE 16.</bibl>
               <q>BY ME PRINCES RULE, AND NOBLES, EVEN ALL THE JUDGES OF THE EARTH.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN compliance with the laudable example of our pious Anceſtors, on ſuch joyful anniverſary occaſions as this day preſents us with—we have aſſembled in the Houſe of GOD, to offer our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vout praiſes to him for what he has done for them, and for us, their children; to ſeek his direction and bleſſing upon our Political Fathers here pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, in the diſcharge of the important truſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed in them, and his ſmiles on this confederat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed riſing Republic.</p>
            <p>AND as it has fallen to one of the leaſt of the Ambaſſadors of CHRIST, to perform ſo eſſential a part of the exerciſe of the day, it will not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that he turn Stateſman in this ſacred place, or wander into all the affairs of government: But, in compliance with his character as a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, make ſuch obſervations from the ſacred text,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:022506_0005_0FB947A36ACF51F0"/>
as may be profitable for direction and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that the men of GOD here preſent, may be furniſhed to every good work.</p>
            <p>THIS book was pen'd by King Solomon—a man famed for wiſdom and underſtanding through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out all the Eaſt.</p>
            <p>THAT BEING who has an eaſy acceſs to the human mind, appeared to him in Gibeon, in a viſion of the night; and GOD ſaid, aſk what I ſhall give thee? And his requeſt, "give therefore thy ſervant an underſtanding heart," was ſo ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable, that GOD gave him wiſdom above all that were before him in Jeruſalem; for the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſoon perceived "that the wiſdom of GOD was in him to do judgment."</p>
            <p>IN theſe Proverbs of the wiſe man, we have the comprehenſive duties we owe to GOD, and the world, made plain and eaſy, and enforced with the moſt powerful motives. By folly, the Preacher would be underſtood to mean vice and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs—and by wiſdom, grace and CHRIST.</p>
            <p>IN the text, the perſon ſpeaking is doubtleſs JESUS CHRIST, who by the Apoſtle, is called "the wiſdom of GOD, and the power of GOD." "By me Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the earth:" That is, by my Providence
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:022506_0006_0FB947A4E0E55B30"/>
and appointment, they are advanced to rule and govern; and their government is merciful and righteous, happy and proſperous, by my council and aſſiſtance.</p>
            <p>EVER ſince the apoſtacy, the bleſſed GOD, has purſued an uniform plan of grace, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with the church, and the world. The merciful deſign of which, is to reduce to order, peace and happineſs, his intelligent offspring.—To proſecute this deſign, he has ſent into the world the "PRINCE of PEACE," and given him a commiſſion for acts of miniſtry and grace—magiſtracy and government.</p>
            <p>THE intervention of the new covenant, and the advent of JESUS its Mediator, gave birth to order and ſubordination in Heaven, and upon Earth.</p>
            <p>IN Heaven there are thrones, dominions, princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palities and powers, angels and arch-angels; and upon earth, princes, nobles, and judges—and CHRIST is Head over them all.</p>
            <p>THE text leads us to ſpeak of civil government, as ordained of GOD, in the hands of the Mediator; of civil rulers, as holding their commiſſion and authority under CHRIST; of their duty and dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity as his Miniſters, and of the duty and privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the people under their adminiſtration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:022506_0007_0FB947A6C7202C48"/>
I. THAT civil government is ordained of GOD in the hands of the Mediator, the abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of order and government, for the exiſtence and happineſs of ſociety, pleads its divine origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal: For without it; the affairs of mankind would fall into the utmoſt confuſion and diſorder.</p>
            <p>THE nature of man, as a ſociable creature, would no doubt, have led him to ſome ſort of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, had ſin never entered the world. But ſince ſin has debaſed the noble nature of man, and ſpread itſelf through the whole world—both reaſon and revelation plead for government.</p>
            <p>IT is not a matter of human prudence only, but of neceſſity and moral obligation: And being enjoined by him who rules in the kingdoms of mortal men, it is an important mean of delivering us from the evils of the apoſtacy; and deſigned to prepare us for the more encouraging reſtraints the goſpel enjoins.</p>
            <p>CIVIL government, then, is a branch of the tree of life, and founded in, and built upon that covenant, ſealed in Heaven by the oath of GOD, and upon earth by the blood of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>HE being commiſſioned by the Father to manage the great affairs of Empire, as well as of Zion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:022506_0008_0FB947A7F3DB6BD0"/>
"YET have I ſet my King upon my holy Hill of Zion."—"The government ſhall be upon his ſhoulders."</p>
            <p>THE kingdom of CHRIST, where he rules by his word and ſpirit, is his Church, a ſpiritual kingdom. But his commiſſion extends to the utmoſt ends of the earth.</p>
            <p>"FOR the ſtone cut out of the mountain with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out hands, is to break in pieces all other king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, and fill the earth."</p>
            <p>HIS kingdom will outlive all other kingdoms, and ſwallow them up; for he muſt reign till he hath "put down all rule and all authority and power."</p>
            <p>THIS implies that rule and authority among men, or which is the ſame thing, civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a divine appointment, and that it is put into the hands of the Mediator to rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern the world. For when the great and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ends for which he received his mediatorial kingdom, ſhall be accompliſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he will put down both miniſtry and magiſtracy.</p>
            <p>II. THAT civil rulers hold their commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and authority under CHRIST.</p>
            <p>NOT that CHRIST has pointed out the form of government, or the perſons to rule and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:022506_0009_0FB947A95DAC0220"/>
in this ſenſe his "kingdom is not of this world." But chriſtianity enforces the law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and has confirmed the ſeveral conſtitutions of ſtates and kingdoms, and called our obedience to the higher powers, as the goſpel finds them.</p>
            <p>THE mode of government, and perſons to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern, are ſubmitted to the wiſdom of men, in purſuance of a divine ordinance, that ſecond cauſes might operate. It being the method of GOD to carry on the deſigns of his government in this world, by the inſtrumentality of ſubordinate Agents. When therefore, a people unite in a form of government, and chooſe perſons to rule and govern them, and pledge their faith to be obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to, and ſupport the government, "though it be but a man's covenant, yet if it be confirmed, no man diſannulleth or addeth thereunto<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>"</p>
            <p>THE Magiſtrate then, called to office by the voice of the people, and ſolemnly ſworn, becomes an ordinance of GOD, and receives his authority from him, "by whom Princes rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the earth."</p>
            <p>AND the Apoſtle, when he enjoins obedience to civil rulers, "becauſe the powers that be, are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of GOD," means to include in his idea, the methods by which they become poſſeſſed of their power, and likewiſe the uſe and improvement
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:022506_0010_0FB947AAE78821E8"/>
they make of it: If they rule for GOD, and for good to the people, they are to be ſubjected to, otherwiſe, "we ought to obey GOD, rather than men."</p>
            <p>III. WE come to ſpeak of the duty and digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of civil rulers, as the miniſters of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>1ſt. IT is their duty to uphold the kingdom of CHRIST, which conſiſts in "righteouſneſs, and peace, and joy in the HOLY GHOST."</p>
            <p>RELIGION is, and ever has been, conſidered the glory of a people; as it inſures the favour and protection of Heaven.</p>
            <p>UNDER the former diſpenſation, the Ark of GOD, which contained his laws, was a token of his preſence and defence. Governour Eli, whoſe heart trembled for it, ſuſtained the tidings of the of the death of his two Sons with fortitude; but when it was told him that the Ark of GOD was taken, he fell and died, and his Daughter refuſed to be comforted, though a Son was born; becauſe the glory was departed from Iſrael, and the Ark of GOD was taken.</p>
            <p>UNDER this diſpenſation, the goſpel and its ordinances, are our glory and defence. And as magiſtrates are honoured by CHRIST, and act under his banner, they ſhould be careful to be his glory, and ſupport his religion in the world.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:022506_0011_0FB947AE2F298068"/>
ALL men ſhould be poſſeſſed of a principle of piety and virtue; but none ſtand in greater need of it than thoſe who are called to rule and govern.</p>
            <p>RELIGION dignifies and enobles the mind—refines and purifies the heart—fits men to act worthily their part on the ſtage of life, and ſhines with a peculiar luſtre in the chriſtian magiſtrate<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> This will procure for them honour in the ſight of all men; "for thoſe that honour m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, I will honour."</p>
            <p>SAUL was deſtitute of this principle; but de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous of its fruits and effects. Therefore he preſſed the man of GOD, and laid hold on the ſkirt of his mantle, and it rent; ſaying "honour me now I pray thee, before the Elders of my people."</p>
            <p>THIS is the way to have the preſence, and bleſſing of GOD with them, and upon their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration.</p>
            <p>THE ſeat of the magiſtrate is called the throne of GOD; "and he was caught up unto GOD, and into his throne." As they have the image of GOD upon them as his Miniſters, and act by his authority, it ſhould be their care to have the image of GOD within them as men.</p>
            <p>IT is an honourable account we have of Judah, in a time of general revolt, the ten tribes went
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:022506_0012_0FB947B29DEBAEE8"/>
after Jeroboam; "but Judah yet ruleth with GOD, and is faithful with the ſaints."</p>
            <p>IF religion is not honoured and ſupported by men in places of public truſt, the glory of the LORD will ſoon depart, and the fire of GOD be ſcattered over the city.</p>
            <p>RULERS are called "the ſhields of the earth;" they are to protect the people from injuries among men, and likewiſe from the judgments of GOD. When GOD's wrath was kindled againſt Iſrael, for their idolatry at the foot of the mount, we find Moſes, that pious ruler, pleading the cauſe of the people, and he founds his plea upon GOD's covenant, and reminds him of his oath. And David, that man after GOD's own heart, when he ſaw the Angel that ſmote the people, ſaid, but theſe ſheep, what have they done? "And the LORD ſaid unto the Angel, it is enough, ſtay now thine hand."</p>
            <p>THE attention chriſtian rulers pay to religion in their hearts, and in their government, will be their ſupport when they are called to lay down their commiſſion, and their lives; it will brighten the ſcene before them, and embalm their memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries when they are dead.</p>
            <p>2d. IT is the duty of chriſtian rulers, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve and ſecure to the people, their liberties and properties.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:022506_0013_0FB947B5AF9F3920"/>
THE end and deſign of civil government is to ſecure the happineſs of the whole community. For this, rulers are appointed; "he is the Miniſter of GOD to thee <hi>for good."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE liberties of mankind have ever been held dear, for they are given by GOD and nature. "With a great ſum, obtained I this freedom," ſays the chief Captain to Paul, who replied, "but I was born free."</p>
            <p>THIS has been and ſtill is the voice of Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans; and our attention to this voice, which is from Heaven, has brought us into poſſeſſion of the liberties and privileges, we this day enjoy.</p>
            <p>AN infringement on theſe, has ever awakened the fears, and kindled the reſentment of an en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened people!—It has overturned empires and kingdoms—cauſed the ſtars to fall from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and princes to walk, as at this day, like ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants on the earth!</p>
            <p>IN order to ſecure the liberties and privileges of the people, righteous and equitable laws ſhould be made, and preſerved.—"That which is alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether juſt ſhall ye follow," is an injunction from the Firſt Magiſtrate in the univerſe.</p>
            <p>WE plead for a government of laws, not of men. The law is a rule to try all cauſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween man and man by; and it is a rule between
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:022506_0014_0FB947B6E59C8A40"/>
the magiſtrate and ſubject—it teaches the one how to rule, and the other how to obey.</p>
            <p>THEY are the pillars on which the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth ſtands; to them we appeal for a redreſs of grievances, and into their hands we are willing to fall; but not into the hands of men. They are in ſcripture, called the foundations of the earth; and ſaid to be out of courſe, when the magiſtrate is either ignorant of them, or neglects to ſupport his authority in their execution.</p>
            <p>3d. THE chriſtian ruler will hear the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, and redreſs the grievances of the people he governs.</p>
            <p>HE will not with Rehoboam, reject the voice of the old men whoſe years have taught them wiſdom, and apply to young men for coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; anſwer the people with grievous words, and cauſe them to ſay in the bitterneſs of their ſouls, "what portion have we in David? neither have we inheritance in the ſon of Jeſſe." But he will enlighten the ignorant; and thoſe that are out of the way, he will reduce to order and obedience, with the cords of law and love. He will follow the example of him by whom he rules, whoſe work and glory it is, to make peace and bind up the wounds of the people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:022506_0015_0FB947B86592BA88"/>
CHRISTIAN rulers will conſider the infancy of the people, and the burdens laid upon them, and be careful leſt they over-drive, and ſo deſtroy the flock of GOD.</p>
            <p>THEY will leſſen the charges of government, and lighten every burden, as much as is conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with the honour and well-being of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>THE cauſe of the widow, the fatherleſs, the orphan, the ſoldier, and him that has loaned his money for the help of government, will come with peculiar grace before chriſtian rulers; who will hold themſelves Heaven's clients to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their righteous claims, and plead their cauſe.</p>
            <p>THE credit of the Commonwealth, at home and abroad, is a matter that requires particular attention: In many inſtances its faith has been pledged. But chriſtian rulers will remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that our father Abraham, was not juſtified by faith only; and add energy to our faith, that we may as a people, be juſtified in the ſight of GOD, and the world.</p>
            <p>4th. WE come as propoſed, to ſpeak of the duty and privilege of the people under the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of chriſtian rulers. And</p>
            <p>1ſt. IT is their duty to pray for them.</p>
            <p>GOVERNMENT is an important truſt, and though it be limitted by righteous and equitable
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:022506_0016_0FB947B9F1D5B4A8"/>
laws; yet ſuch is the condition of human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in this world, that the greateſt and beſt of men are liable to err, and are inſufficient to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage the great affairs of ſtate, without direction and influence from Heaven.</p>
            <p>GOD is the bleſſed and only potentate—his eſſential perfections are his bleſſedneſs, and enable him to manage an univerſal Empire! He ſtands in no need of his creatures' wealth to maintain his crown, their power to effect his deſigns, or their wiſdom to direct his counſels. But it is far otherwiſe with his vicegerents here on earth; though they are called Gods, and clothed with authority from CHRIST and the people—yet they are but men.</p>
            <p>THE affairs of government are often intricate and perplexing, and dangers eminent and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, ſo that rulers find occaſion to adopt the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of the pious king of Judah, "neither know we what to do."</p>
            <p>WE are divinely bound to pray "for all in au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority," that government might be equal and righteous, and that we might "lead a peaceable and quiet life, in all godlineſs and honeſty."</p>
            <p>IT is the bleſſing of GOD, that makes government ſteady and effectual, and gives peace
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:022506_0017_0FB947BB5D139A80"/>
and quietneſs to the Commonwealth; and GOD will be ſaught unto, for ſuch an ineſtimable bleſſing.</p>
            <p>WHEN we pray for them, we pray for the advancement of peace, and godlineſs, this being the end for which government is inſtituted.</p>
            <p>2d. IT is the duty of the people, to ſupport their rulers.—That authority by which they govern; injoins obedience from the people to all their righteous laws.</p>
            <p>AND as they have a painful pre-eminence above their fellow mortals, and an arduous and important truſt committed to them by God, and the people; they ſhould be freed from cares and troubles about the affairs of the world.—"For this cauſe, pay you tribute alſo; for they are GOD's Miniſters, attending continually upon this very thing."—The advantages we enjoy under a righteous adminiſtration, intitle thoſe who govern to large returns. Our perſons and properties are ſecured, and we ſet under our own vine and fig-tree, being protected, by a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment merciful and righteous.</p>
            <p>WHEN taxes are made for the ſupport of government, there is a moral obligation on the people, to diſcharge them; for government which is an ordinance of GOD, could not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt without ſuch ſupport.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:022506_0018_0FB947BCDEF77D80"/>
OUR bleſſed LORD ſet us an example worthy of imitation, when he ſent Peter to the mouth of the fiſh, that he might receive money to pay their tribute—And injoined upon us to "render to Caeſar, the things that be Caeſars."—A ſupport, honor, love and obedience, are injoined through the whole book of GOD, upon the people, as a juſt tribute due to thoſe who govern.</p>
            <p>IT is the privilege of the people granted them by GOD and nature, to chooſe their own ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers.</p>
            <p>KINGLY government was never of divine ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; but added, as the law was, "by rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of tranſgreſſion."</p>
            <p>THE government, early eſtabliſhed in the world among the ancient Hebrews, was a free republic like ours, the ſovereignty reſided in the body of the people.</p>
            <p>THEY were to chooſe able men; and they were called to give their aſſent to the laws given from Heaven, before they were put into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>WHEN government is thus founded, according to the divine mind, and rulers choſen, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come repreſentatives of the power and majeſty of GOD; and important inſtruments employed by
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:022506_0019_0FB947BE67C2D540"/>
his providence and grace, in the adminiſtration of affairs in this lower world.</p>
            <p>THEY are intruſted with the lives, liberties and properties of the people, For them prayer ſhould be continually made, and to them obedience given, as GOD's vicegerents, when they rule for him, and for good to the people.</p>
            <p>PEOPLE ſhould be careful of cenſuring them, and encreaſing their burden and concern, leſt they be reproved by him, who has forbid our "revil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Gods, or ſpeaking evil of the rulers of the people."</p>
            <p>BUT when rulers neglect the great affairs of government—when they break not every yoke—plead not the cauſe of the injured and innocent, the widow and fatherleſs, the poor and needy—when they do not ſupport religion, liberty, the arts and literature; the pillars of government will fall, and ſociety throw off its pleaſing appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel: "The ſword ſhall be upon the arm, and upon the right eye of the magiſtrate"—he ſhall loſe his diſcernment in public meaſures, and his authority ſhall be taken away.</p>
            <p>ON the other hand when thoſe in authority, move with dignity in their proper ſphere, are GOD's miniſters for good; and people are ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:022506_0020_0FB947C16EB9F5B8"/>
for conſcience ſake, what a pleaſing ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance does the Commonwealth put on! ſuch as once induced the prophet to exclaim "how goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy taber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nacles O Iſrael!"</p>
            <p>FROM what has been ſaid we may infer.</p>
            <p>1ſt. THAT GOD in the ſcheme of grace by CHRIST, provided for the happineſs of mankind in this world, as well as for their immortality and glory in the next. And foreſeeing to what endleſs confuſion and irregularity the world would tumble, without order and ſubordination: has with one ſtroke wrote himſelf, religion and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment on the mind of man.—And has ſent his SON from Heaven to explain, and enforce, what, at firſt, he wrote on the mind of man, and to reign and govern in righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>CIVIL government is deſigned to ſubſerve the grace of the goſpel; and the happineſs it deffuſes through ſociety in this world, ſhould call forth our gratitude, and praiſe to GOD, its author.</p>
            <p>IT ſmooths the rugged road of life, gives the quiet and peaceable enjoyment of every bleſſing, and raiſes in the mind, the moſt exalted concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of that bleſſed BEING, whoſe benevolent deſign, is to raiſe the virtuous among mankind, by ſmall gradations, to happineſs and perfection with himſelf.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:022506_0021_0FB947C457141C90"/>
GOVERNMENT is a link in the chain of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting mercy; and thoſe who are obedient "for the LORDS ſake" who has appointed it, may expect that their path will ſhine more and more unto the perfect day.</p>
            <p>2d. WE infer.—That days of greater peace and happineſs, then have ever dawn'd upon the church and world, are before us in America—This we argue from the ability of CHRIST's perſon, the extent of his commiſſion, his going forth of old with our fathers; and the deliverance he hath wrought for this generation.</p>
            <p>THE kingdom of providence, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of grace are his; and he manages the affairs of the one in ſubſerviency to the other.</p>
            <p>IT has been the method of GOD from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, to reveal the deſigns of his grace and mercy to the world by degrees.</p>
            <p>HE promiſed one, mighty to ſave, and able to govern ſoon after the apoſtacy in the garden; but four thouſand years were numbered, before the deſire of all nations came.</p>
            <p>SINCE he appeared on the theatre of life, the church and world have preſſed on for ages, thro' the fire of perſecution: Deluges of blood, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and ſlaughter, but little benefited, to appearance, by his coming and death.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:022506_0022_0FB947C51DCE7288"/>
'TILL the Angel of the LORD pointed our fore-fathers to this Weſtern World; a land where he determined to unfold the plan of redemption and government. Here they found a ſafe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from perſecution and cruelty. Savage beaſts and men vaniſhed before them, like the dew be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the riſing ſun.</p>
            <p>HERE the church was founded upon the doctrines of CHRIST, and the Apoſtles—which put forth her branches like the palm-tree, and bid fair to eclipſe the glory of the world.</p>
            <p>THIS awakened the fears of the country from whence they came, who were grieved at our greatneſs and envious at our riſing glory, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to take from us, our liberty, and this land GOD gave to our fathers; prepared chains to bind us to paſſive obedience, and drag us to perdition. The great charter was violated, and the laws that were to protect this infant world, infringed upon. "The foundations were all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and what could the righteous do?"</p>
            <p>IN that day of our diſtreſs, we appealed to the ſtrength of JEHOVAH, and the juſtice of our cauſe: "And GOD came from Teman, and the Holy One from Mount Paran"—he ſtood and meaſured the earth, and drove aſunder the nations, and confirmed us in the poſſeſſion of this goodly land.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:022506_0023_0FB947C7AFAC6FF0"/>
UNDER the direction, and by the aſſiſtance of HIM, who adminiſters on Heaven's eternal plan, we are delivered from the horrors of war, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy both civil and religious liberty!</p>
            <p>WE have been led to frame and adopt a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of government that is the wonder of the world; reſembling that which GOD of old, gave the Iſraelites, the ſeed of Abraham his friend.</p>
            <p>WE ſhouted with heart-felt joy, when the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical ark was brought to its place. Sing O Heavens for the LORD hath redeemed New-England, and glorified himſelf in America!</p>
            <p>WHEN we look over theſe great events, we are conſtrained to cry out with the Patriarch, "ſurely the LORD is in this place, and we know it not."</p>
            <p>WE are reſpected abroad among the nations of the earth, and united at home. GOD has put this honour upon us, and ſpoke peace to our bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders.</p>
            <p>THE ſyſtem of national government we have ſettled, we hope, will ſecure to us, and hand down to the generations to come, the liberties and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges we have procured by our toil, treaſures, and the blood of many of our virtuous ſons.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:022506_0024_0FB947CE04AC9C08"/>
THE choiceſt bleſſings, religion, liberty and peace, were reſerved in the counſels of GOD, for thee, O America!</p>
            <p>AND what GOD has done for our fathers, and for us of this generation, are but intimations of our future happineſs and glory; that he will have a light before him in this Jeruſalem, 'till the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming of HIM, who is the "light to lighten the Gentiles, and the glory of his people Iſrael." Here the empire of JESUS is founded, and theſe are the halcyon days diſcloſed to the pious Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, in a viſion of the night—</p>
            <p>"AND behold! one like the Son of Man came to the ancient of days, and there was given him dominion, glory and a kingdom; and his domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion is an everlaſting dominion, which ſhall not paſs away; and his kingdom, that, which ſhall not be deſtroyed."</p>
            <p>FROM the riſe and preſent exaltation of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, we conclude ſhe is to be the theatre, where the latter day glory ſhall be diſplayed; and the medium through which religion, liberty and learning, ſhall be handed round creation.</p>
            <p>3d. WE infer—That CHRIST will vindicate the ſacred rights of his government, in the utter deſtruction of all that oppoſe his reign.</p>
            <p>IT becomes rulers, miniſters and people, to be willing ſubjects of this kingdom, that they may be the glory of CHRIST its King.</p>

               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:022506_0025_0FB947CEE4030A38"/>
THE impious and ungodly will be enſnared in their own plots and deviſes; and the Heavens will reveal their iniquity one day. "Kiſs the Son, leſs he be angry, and ye periſh from the way."</p>
            <p>TRUE it is, GOD has done great things for us; he has delivered us from war, and invited us by the dawn of peace, to lay aſide the dread artillery of death; he has given us a land that flows with milk and honey, and ſettled both church and ſtate in peace.</p>
            <p>BUT what is this to the ſinners of my people, who live in intemperance, debauchery, pride and luxury, fraud and deceit; who violate GOD's holy laws, neglect the duties of the goſpel co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, caſt off fear, and reſtrain prayer before GOD.</p>
            <p>JESUS, who is exalted at the head of the univerſal polity of Angels and men, when his wrath is kindled but a little, will daſh ſuch characters to pieces like a potter's earthern veſſel.</p>
            <p>FROM the evil returns we have made to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for paſt mercies, we have reaſon to fear the divine rebukes: "You only have I known of all the families of the earth, therefore I will puniſh you for your iniquities."</p>
            <p>GOD brought his people of old to the borders of the promiſed land; but they murmured againſt Moſes and Aaron, and were for making a Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:022506_0026_0FB947D066698AB8"/>
and returning into Egypt. This provoked HIM who had done great things for them, to ſay "your carcaſſes ſhall fall in the wilderneſs, and ye ſhall know my breach of promiſe: But your little ones, them will I bring in, and they ſhall know the land which ye have diſpiſed."—So it will be with the wicked of this generation; with Balaam we behold the glory of America, but not nigh; we ſhall meet the grave, and the horrors of eternity; and our "ſons will come to honor, and we know it not."</p>
            <p>WE have ſolemn tidings this day from the mount of GOD:—The children of New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land have forſaken my covenant: Do ye thus requite the LORD?—O fooliſh people and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe!</p>
            <p>HEAR with what irreſiſtable eloquence the prophet Iſaiah pleads againſt the impenitent of this age and country; "Hear O Heavens, and give ear O Earth, for I have nouriſhed and brought up children, and they have rebelled againſt me."</p>
            <p>O THAT we may as a people, know in this our day, the things of our peace, repent, and do our firſt works; that GOD may heal us, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow thoſe bleſſings, he has encouraged us to hope for, from paſt mercies.

HIS Honor the Lieutenant-Governour, claims our next reſpects, to whom the diſcourſe is now addreſſed:—</p>
            <p>MAY IT PLEASE YOUR HONOR,</p>
            <p>IT has pleaſed GOD to ſpare your important life, to ſee the fruit of your labor and anxiety, in years paſt, and to awaken the attention of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to call upon you, to exert your talents and abilities for the good of this Commonwealth, at a time when the voice of men, whoſe years have taught them, is needed.</p>
            <p>YOUR integrity, patriotiſm and devotedneſs to the cauſe of your country, has given you favor, and kindled in the minds of the people, eſteem and veneration, that time will not obliterate.</p>
            <p>THE Recording Angle will not ſilently paſs by your labor and attention, when we came over Jordan with our ſtaff.</p>
            <p>THE laws of juſtice and gratitude, which are the laws of GOD, require that we accept it with thankfulneſs to you, and more eſpecially to that GOD, who has made you ſo inſtrumental in deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering us from tyranny and oppreſſive power.</p>
            <p>WE have a recent remembrance of the critical day, when His Excellency and your Honor, were excluded a pardon, by thoſe who were bound to aſk pardon of GOD and America, for their inſults and cruelty.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:022506_0031_0FB947D7DCEA0210"/>
YOU have lived to ſee your deſires accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; the Temple of Liberty raiſed—and the glory of America, ſounded through the world by the trump of Fame!—Now your eyes behold this, you are ready to adopt the words of Simeon, when he claſped the infant Saviour in his arms, "now letteſt thou thy ſervant depart in peace, for I have ſeen thy ſalvation."</p>
            <p>WE look to you, honoured ſir, and expect that you conſpire with your beſt endeavours, to make eaſy and happy, this great people: And may a grateful people, by their returns of honor and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, equal your paſt, and their expectations of your future ſervices.</p>
            <p>MAY GOD have you in his holy keeping; make the remainder of your days comfortable and happy, and when he ſhall ſee fit to diſcharge you from further ſervices below, may you ſhine forth with reſplendent glory in the kingdom of the Redeemer above.</p>
            <p>AND may the Honourable COUNCIL, ſo ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary and important a Branch in government, be counſelled and directed of GOD; and in all matters that come before them, act with ſtability and firmneſs, being influenced by that wiſdom which is from above.</p>
            <p>MAY your piety and virtue, gentlemen, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you to the favour and protection of Heaven;
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:022506_0032_0FB947DAE0A28DA0"/>
and your integrity and uprightneſs of conduct, render you more and more objects of the love and confidence of your brethren. But if your la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and fidelity, ſhould not meet the approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world, as it is often the caſe, you will have within you, conſcious worth—before you, an animating proſpect of the acceptance of GOD, and a reward in the world to come.</p>
            <p>THE Honourable the SENATE, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable the HOUSE of REPRESENTATIVES, claim the attention of the Preacher, and to whom he would now turn his diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>YOU are this day, reſpectable gentlemen, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the ordinance of GOD, for good; and, having received authority from CHRIST, and the people, you have before you a very weighty con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, to promote the beſt intereſt of the people, and ſee that the Commonwealth receive no detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>THE miltitude of your brethren have put con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in you, and made you the keepers of their vineyard. You will regard, gentlemen, the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred incloſure of CHRIST, and be nurſing fathers to his church, and people. We look to you for equal and righteous laws, and a pattern of every virtue.</p>
            <p>

You will remember, that government came into the world, on the ſame benevolent errand its Divine Author did, not to perplex and deſtroy men's lives, but to enlighten, reform and ſave them: And if there are any laws too ſanguine in the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſe of life and death, you will adopt ſome other puniſhment than that of ſending ſouls un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared, to the tribunal of GOD.</p>
            <p>BE not unmindful, ſirs, that the eyes of GOD are upon you in your public capacity: He ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves what attention you pay to the concerns of the public—to the widow and fatherleſs, the poor and needy, and the cauſe of virtue and religion. To him you are accountable, and before his awe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tribunal you muſt ſoon ſtand, with the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of your brethren.</p>
            <p>You are called Gods, let your compaſſion to the poor, reſemble that of the Father of Mercies.</p>
            <p>GUARD againſt pride, coveteouſneſs, and a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to bind heavy burdens on the people.</p>
            <p>LAY aſide party conſiderations and private de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns, and do that which you can anſwer to GOD, and the people. Then you will be bleſſed—and the bleſſings of many, ready to periſh, will come upon you. And in the laſt grand revolution, when all diſtinctions, but thoſe of a religious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture will be forever done away, you will meet the approbation of HIM, by whom you rule, and your
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:022506_0034_0FB947E059F752D8"/>
reward will be great. We wiſh you divine di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and a bleſſing, this day, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t of the houſe of GOD.</p>
            <p>LET this great and attentive Aſſembly, call to mind the duties they owe to GOD, and the world, and the obligations they are under to the faithful diſcharge of them.</p>
            <p>OF infinite importance is it to us, chriſtian friends, that we are poſſeſſed of that faith in, and faithfulneſs to CHRIST, which the goſpel conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution makes neceſſary, in order for us to obtain eternal life. If we are the ſubjects of divine grace, and act worthily our part on the ſtage of life, we may meet adverſity with fortitude, and death with comfort—for it will reach us to a world, where GOD will be the ſun, in which he will run through our ſouls with a torrent of delight. On this pleaſing hope and joyful expectation, I will diſmiſs you, until that day, in which may the Preacher find mercy, and meet you all amongſt the redeemed of the LORD—and the glory ſhall be given to HIM, who ſitteth upon the throne, and to the LAMB, forever and ever; and let all the people ſay</p>
