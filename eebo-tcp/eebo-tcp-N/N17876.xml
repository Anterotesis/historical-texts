            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE To the SECOND VOLUME.</head>
            <p>WHEN the firſt volume was print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, I had not ſeen the
"Political Annals"
of the American Colonies, pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed in 1780, by George Chalmers, Eſq. This gentleman, being in England, was favored with ſome advantages, of which I was deſtitute; having acceſs to the books and papers of the Lords of Trade and Plantations, from the firſt eſtabliſhment of that Board. He ſeems to poſſeſs the diligence and patience which are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in a hiſtorian; but either through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>advertence or want of candor, has made ſome miſrepreſentations reſpecting New-Hampſhire, on which I ſhall take the lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty to remark.</p>
            <p>In page 491, ſpeaking of the firſt Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil, of which Preſident CUTTS was at the head, he ſays,
<q>they refuſed to take the accuſtomed oaths, as the Engliſh law required, becauſe liberty of conſcience was allowed them.</q>
In the firſt volume of my hiſtory, page 176, I have ſaid,
<q>they
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:023166_0003_0FBC76ECDCA1E138"/>
publiſhed the commiſſion and took the oaths;</q>
for which I cited the Council records; and on recurring to them, I find the following entry, in the hand writing of Elias Stileman, Secretary.</p>
            <q>
               <p>
                  <hi>January</hi> 21, 1679—80.</p>
               <p>His Majeſty's Commiſſioners, nomy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in ſaid commiſſion, tooke their reſpective oathes, as menconed in ſaid commiſſion.</p>
            </q>
            <p>That the oaths were really taken, is a fact beyond all diſpute; but if there is any ground for what Mr. Chalmers is pleaſed to call a refuſal, it muſt have been reſpecting the <hi>form</hi> of ſwearing; which was uſually done here by lifting the hand, and not by laying it on the bible, as was the form in England. Was it a forced conſtruction of the clauſe reſpecting lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty of conſcience, to ſuppoſe, that this indulgence was granted to them? What other uſe could they have made of this liberty, than to act according to the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of their conſciences? Is it then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with candor, to publiſh an aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſo worded as to admit the idea, that theſe gentlemen <hi>refuſed</hi> to obey an eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial
<pb n="v" facs="unknown:023166_0004_0FBC76EDF70B0C98"/>
part of the duty preſcribed by the commiſſion, which they undertook to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute? Or is it conſiſtent with the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which he gives of the Preſident, CUTTS, p. 492, that
<q>he was allowed to have been an honeſt man and a loyal ſubject?</q>
The commiſſion required them to take the oaths of allegiance and ſupremacy, and an oath of office, which laſt is recited in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; but not a word is ſaid of the mode and form, in which the oaths ſhould be taken; neither was it ſaid that they ſhould be taken 'as the Engliſh law required.' They were therefore left at their liberty, to take them in any form which was agreeable to their conſcience, or their former uſage.</p>
            <p>In the ſame page (491) he ſays;
<q>An Aſſembly was ſoon called, which, by means of the uſual intrigues, was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of perſons, extremely favorable to the projects of thoſe who now engroſſed power.</q>
And in a note (page 507)
<q>the Council tranſmitted to the towns, a liſt of thoſe who ſhould be allowed to vote.</q>
            </p>
            <p>With what propriety can it be ſaid that theſe gentlemen <hi>engroſſed</hi> power, when they were commiſſioned by the King;
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:023166_0005_0FBC76EF796DC070"/>
and it is acknowledged, that not only their appointment, but their entering on office, was contrary to their inclinations?</p>
            <p>That the perſons choſen into the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly ſhould be 'favorable' to the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the Council, or of 'the wiſe men of Boſton,' was not the reſult of any intrigues; but becauſe the majority of the people were of the ſame mind. As to ſending
<q>a liſt of thoſe who ſhould be allowed to vote;</q>
the true ſtate of the matter was this. The commiſſion provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the calling of an Aſſembly, within three months after the Council ſhould be ſworn, by ſummons under ſeal,
<q>uſing and obſerving therein ſuch rules and methods, as to the perſons who are to chooſe the deputies, and the time and place of meeting, as they (the Council) ſhall judge moſt convenient.</q>
The mode which they judged moſt convenient was, to order the ſelect men of the four towns, to take a liſt of the names and eſtates of their reſpective inhabitants, according to their uſual manner of making taxes, and ſend it to the Council. The Council then iſſued an order, appointing <hi>the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:023166_0006_0FBC76F0F6CDF010"/>
therein named,</hi> to meet in their reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive towns, and elect by a major vote, three perſons from each, to repreſent them in a general Aſſembly, on the 16th of March; and in the order, there is this proviſo,
<q>Provided that wee do not intend that what is now done be preſidential for the future, and that it ſhall extend noe farther, than to the calling this firſt aſſembly.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Now as the rules and methods of call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an aſſembly, and the perſons who were to chooſe deputies, were left to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion of the Council; what more proper method could they have taken, than to call for a liſt of the inhabitants and their eſtates, and by that means to determine, who were qualified in point of property and habitancy to be electors? And as the numbers were few, and the perſons well known, was it not as proper to name them at once, in the writs, as to eſtabliſh qualifications, and appoint other perſons to judge of thoſe qualifications; eſpecially when there was no law in force by which they could be judged? It is obſervable that each voter was ordered to take the oath of al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:023166_0007_0FBC76F5854837F8"/>
if he had not taken it before; and in the liſt of names in the book, a mark is ſet againſt ſeveral perſons, who did not take the oath; and another againſt thoſe who did not appear at the election. Has this the appearance of <hi>intrigue?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In page 492, he ſays,
<q>they were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely ſlow in conforming to preſent requiſitions, and paſſed no laws during the firſt ſeſſion.</q>
Having again conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the records, I find in the Journal of the Council this entry,
<q>At a general Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly held in Portſmouth, the 16th of March, 1679—80. Preſent, &amp;c. Sundry laws and ordinances made <hi>at this ſeſſion</hi> are in another booke, for that purpoſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In that other book, a body of laws is recorded, in the ſame hand writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, viz. of Stileman the Secretary, which bears the following title;
<q>The general laws and liberties of the Province of New-Hampſhire, made by the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Aſſembly in Portſmouth, the 16th day of March, 1679—80, and approved by the Preſident and Council.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It appears from the books, that this
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:023166_0008_0FBC76F6F74E3400"/>
Aſſembly held four ſeſſions within the year, viz. on the 16th of March, the 7th of June, the 12th of October, and the 7th of December. As there is not a particular date to each law, but the whole code bears the date of the firſt ſeſſion in March; it may fairly be inferred, that the buſineſs was begun in the firſt ſeſſion, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued through the other three; and when completed, was immediately ſent to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; for Mr. Chalmers himſelf tells us, that
<q>the laws which they tranſmitted, in conformity to their Conſtitution, had no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>From this ſtatement it may be conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that they were not ſlower in
<q>eſſaying their legiſlative talents,</q>
than the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of proceeding with due deliberation re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; and that there was no juſt cauſe for the reproach which he has caſt upon them.</p>
            <p>In page 494, he gives this account of the character of the people of New-Hampſhire.
<q>When CRANFIELD arrived, he found the Province containing four thouſand inhabitants, extremely poor
<pb n="x" facs="unknown:023166_0009_0FBC76F8810C8630"/>
from the devaſtation of the Indian war. But when he ſpoke contemptuouſly of the country which he had been ſent to rule, he ſeems not to have reflected, that all Colonies had once known the like paucity of numbers, the ſame weakneſs, and the ſame poverty; animated only by a <hi>diſſimilar ſpirit</hi> from that of New-Hampſhire, which now diſdained that <hi>independence on her neighbours,</hi> that other Provinces had contended for, with en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thuſiaſm. And other plantations, actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by very different maxims, had not complained, even in their weakeſt days, of their inability to defend their fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers, againſt the attacks of a foe, that has never proved dangerous, except to the <hi>effeminate,</hi> the factious, or the <hi>cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly.</hi> When New Plimouth conſiſted only of two hundred perſons, of all ages and ſexes, it repulſed its enemies and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured its borders, with a gallantry wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of its parent country; becauſe it ſtood alone, in the deſert, without hope of aid.</q>
            </p>
            <p>That the people of New-Hampſhire ever deſerved the character of <hi>effeminate</hi> or
<pb n="xi" facs="unknown:023166_0010_0FBC76FC0288ED00"/>
               <hi>cowardly,</hi> can by no means be admitted. Innumerable facts evince the contrary beyond a doubt. Had this author ever reſided among them, eſpecially in time of war, he would have thought quite other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe of them. That the native ſavages have
<q>never proved a <hi>dangerous</hi> foe, to any but the effeminate, the factious and the cowardly,</q>
is an aſſertion totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded. Their manner of attacking was always by ſurpriſe, and the braveſt and beſt men may ſometimes be deficient in vigilance, where no ſuſpicion of danger exiſts.</p>
            <p>If the people of New-Hampſhire
<q>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained independence,</q>
let it be conſidered, that they had been, for about 40 years, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with Maſſachuſetts, to their mutual ſatisfaction; and the propoſed

which he means was but another name for ſubjection to a landlord. When independence, in its genuine meaning, became neceſſary, in 1776, they freely joined with their brethren in aſſerting it, and in bravely defending it.</p>
            <p>Without any diſparagement to the firſt ſettlers of Plymouth, who, from the year
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:023166_0011_0FBC76FECBEA23F0"/>
1643, were protected by a confederacy of the four New-England Colonies, it may with truth be ſaid, that the people of New-Hampſhire were never behind them, in vigorous exertions for their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, when they were conducted by offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in whom they could place confidence; but in Cranfield's time, there was no war with the Indians; though he attempted to frighten them into an apprehenſion of danger, from the Indians, to ſerve his own purpoſes.</p>
            <p>The account which Mr. Chalmers gives of Cranfield's adminiſtration differs not very materially from mine, except in one inſtance. He repreſents
<q>the miniſters as very attentive to him, becauſe they deemed him gained over to the Independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents.</q>
I have met with no evidence of this; the deception, if any, muſt have been very ſhort lived.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chalmers ſays nothing of the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of Moody, and of Cranfield's en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to ruin him, for his non-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to the Church of England; but tells us that he
<q>deemed it unſafe, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main any longer among the miniſters,
<pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:023166_0012_0FBC77004D23CCD0"/>
who ruled an enthuſiaſtic people, with the ſame ſway as did the popiſh clergy during the darkeſt ages;</q>
and that in his letters to England, he
<q>gave warning, that while the clergy were allowed to preach, no true allegiance would be found in thoſe parts.</q>
This may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a corroborating evidence of his bigotry and intolerance. Truth obliges me to add, that his opponents were not defici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in thoſe unhappy qualities, which were too much in faſhion among all parties in that age.</p>
            <p>Mr. Chalmers concludes his account of New-Hampſhire in theſe words.
<q>Being excluded from the charter granted to Maſſachuſetts, it has continued to the preſent time, a different, though <hi>inconſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable</hi> ſettlement; irregular and factious in its economy, affording no precedents that may be of exemplary uſe to other Colonies.</q>
What juſtice there is in this remark, the reader will be able to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, from the following portion of its hiſtory, which, after much unavoidable delay, is now ſubmitted to his peruſal.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XIII. The adminiſtration of Governor <hi>SHUTE,</hi> and his Lieutenants, <hi>VAUGHAN</hi> and <hi>WENT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>WORTH.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>GEORGE VAUGHAN, Eſq. was the ſon of Major William Vaughan,<note place="margin">1715.</note> who had been ſo ill uſed by former Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernors, and had ſuffered ſo much in the cauſe of his country, that the advancement of his ſon, to the office of Lieutenant Governor, was eſteemed a mark of particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar favor, from the Crown to the Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince, and a ſingular gratification to the parent, then in the decline of life. The Lieutenant Governor had been employed by the Province, as their agent in England, to manage their defence againſt Allen. There he was taken notice of, by ſome perſons of quality and influence, with whom his father had been connected; and by them he was recommended as a candidate for the honor to which he was now advanced.</p>
            <p>After he had arrived, and opened his commiſſion; Dudley,<note place="margin">Oct. 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> though not actually
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023166_0018_0FBC770CDD8C3968"/>
ſuperſeded, yet daily expecting Burges to ſucceed him, did not think it proper to come into the Province, or perform any acts of government; ſo that, during a year,<note place="margin">Nov. 8.</note> Vaughan had the ſole command. In this time he called an Aſſembly, who grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him the product of the impoſt and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, for one year, but refuſed to eſtabliſh theſe duties for any longer time; upon which he diſſolved them,<note place="margin">1716.</note> and called anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er;<note place="margin">Auguſt 21.</note> to whom he recommended, in a ſtyle too peremptory,<note place="margin">Aſſembly Records.</note> the eſtabliſhment of a perpetual revenue to the Crown; a matter in which he had been ſo much engaged, that while in England,<note place="margin">MS letter of Sir W. Aſhurſt to Dr. I. Mather.</note>
               <q>he preſented a memorial to the King and Miniſtry, to bring New-England into the land tax of Great Britain; and propoſed that a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiver ſhould be appointed by the Crown.</q>
The Aſſembly was of opinion, that the public charges might be defrayed in the uſual manner, by an equal tax on polls and eſtates; and declined laying an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſt, or entering on any, but the common buſineſs of the year, till the arrival of a Governor.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">Oct. 17.</note>When Governor Shute came to the chair, ſeveral of the old Counſellors were laid aſide, and ſix new ones appointed, all
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023166_0019_0FBC770F03A50390"/>
of whom were inhabitants of Portſmouth. That town, at the ſame time, was unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily agitated by a controverſy, which had for ſome years ſubſiſted between the two pariſhes. This had not only imbittered the minds of the people, but had preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced ſome of the members of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil and Aſſembly; ſo as to affect the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings of the Legiſlature, and break the harmony, which had been preſerved in that body, during the preceding adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Governor, in his firſt ſpeech to the Aſſembly,<note place="margin">1717.</note> took notice of their divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and adviſed them to unanimity.<note place="margin">Jan. 10.</note> They thanked him for his advice, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated againſt the removal of the old Counſellors,<note place="margin">Jan. 23.</note> and the confining of the new appointments, both in the Council and the Judicial Courts, to reſidents in one town, as being contrary to former uſage, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an advantage, to the trading, above the landed intereſt. This, they ſaid, was the reaſon that an impoſt could not now be obtained, and that the whole burden of taxes was laid on the huſbandman, and the laborer, who had been greatly impover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed by the late war. The Governor wiſely avoided an anſwer to this remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance, by putting it on the Council, who
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023166_0020_0FBC771079A30140"/>
were a party in the controverſy. The Council, in their anſwer, acknowledged that the Province had been much diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the war;<note place="margin">Jan. 28.</note> but had in a great meaſure recovered; that there would have been no oppoſition to an impoſt, if the Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives had agreed to an act of export, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the practice in England; that the King had a right to appoint his Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors, from any part of the Province; that it was an affront to the prerogative to find fault with the exerciſe of this right; and that it was moſt convenient for the affairs of government, eſpecially upon ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den emergencies, that the Council ſhould reſide near the ſeat of government. This anſwer might have appeared decent enough if they had not added, that they were
<q>gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the beſt quality, and greateſt ability to ſerve the government, in that ſtation; and had as good or better eſtates in land, and land ſecurities, than any in the Houſe, and not inferior to the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who were laid aſide.</q>
            </p>
            <p>While theſe altercations were in hand there was a great complaint of the ſcarci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of money, and ſome expedient was judged neceſſary to ſupply the place of current coin. A propoſal was made to iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:023166_0021_0FBC7711F5292D38"/>
ten thouſand pounds in bills, on loan, for twenty-three years, at five per cent. on land ſecurity. In this both Houſes agreed;<note place="margin">Jan. 24.</note> but the next day the Council propoſed to enlarge the ſum to fifteen thouſand pounds, to which the Houſe would not conſent. The Governor then ordered the Houſe to attend a conference with the Council; they deſired to know on what ſubject; he gave them no anſwer, but commanded their attendance. Having conferred a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the propoſed loan to no purpoſe, the circumſtance of aſking on what ſubject they were to confer was deemed an affront, and ſerved as a pretext for diſſolving them. The next aſſembly was more pliant, and iſſued fifteen thouſand pounds, on loan,<note place="margin">Aſſembly Records.</note> for eleven years, at ten per cent.</p>
            <p>A controverſy alſo aroſe between the Governor and Lieutenant Governor about the power of the latter, in the abſence of the former. Vaughan contended, that when the Governor was preſent in his other Province, he was abſent from New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and conſequently that the adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration devolved on him. The poſition was a metaphyſical truth, but the infer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was to be meaſured by political rules. Shute alleged that his commiſſions, being
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023166_0022_0FBC77156DDA5B88"/>
publiſhed and recorded, in New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire and Maſſachuſetts, he had the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of commander in chief over both Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces, during his reſidence in either; and thought it an abſurdity to ſuppoſe, that the King had appointed the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor commander in chief, for five or ſix weeks only in the year, and the Lieutenant Governor during the reſt of the time; and that if the Lieutenant Governor ſhould happen, in that time, to ſtep over the Province line, the ſenior Counſellor muſt take the chair; this he ſaid would make the Province 'a monſter with three heads.' The controverſy was ſoon brought to an iſſue; for Vaughan received an order from Shute, while at Boſton, to appoint a faſt, which he did not obey; he received ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to prorogue the Aſſembly, inſtead of which he diſſolved them, without the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of Council. He required the opinion of the Council on the extent of his power, but they declined giving it. Penhallow, the Governor's chief friend, was a warm oppoſer of Vaughan's pretenſions, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred ſo much of his diſpleaſure, that he publicly charged him with ſowing diſcord in the government,<note place="margin">Sept. 24.</note> and ſuſpended him from his ſeat in Council. On hearing this,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023166_0023_0FBC771740388C90"/>
Shute haſted to Portſmouth, and having ſummoned the Council, ordered the King's inſtruction to him for ſuſpending Counſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors to be read, and demanded of Vaughan whether he had any inſtruction which ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeded it. He anſwered, No. The Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor then aſked the Council's advice whether the ſuſpenſion of Penhallow was legal; they anſwered in the negative.<note place="margin">Council Minutes.</note> He then reſtored him to his ſeat, and ſuſpend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Vaughan.</p>
            <p>The Aſſembly, which Vaughan had aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed the right to diſſolve, met again, and approved the proceedings againſt him, juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying the conſtruction which the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor had put on his commiſſion, and his opinion of the extent of the Lieutenant Governor's power; which was
<q>to obſerve ſuch orders, as he ſhould from time to time receive from the King or the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor in chief.</q>
The Repreſentatives of Hampton preſented a remonſtrance; in which, admitting the Lieutenant Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's opinion that
<q>when the Governor is out of the Province, the Lieutenant Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor is impowered to execute the King's commiſſion,</q>
and aſſerting that the Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor was not in the Province when the Lieutenant Governor diſſolved the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,<note place="margin">Aſſembly Records.</note>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:023166_0024_0FBC771AD4D42358"/>
they declared that they could not act with the Houſe, unleſs they were re-elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This remonſtrance was deemed a libel, and the Governor in Council having ſummoned them before him, laid them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der bonds of four hundred pounds each, for their good behaviour.<note place="margin">Council Minutes.</note> He then iſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a proclamation, aſſerting his ſole pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, as commander in chief; and declaring that the Lieutenant Governor had no right to exerciſe any acts of government with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his ſpecial order.<note place="margin">Penhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low's MSS.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To maintain a controverſy with a ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior officer on the extent of power, equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly claimed by both, requires a delicacy and addreſs which does not fall to the lot of every man. An aſpiring and precipitate temper may bring on ſuch a contention, but diſqualifies the perſon from managing it with propriety. Had Vaughan propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſubmit the queſtion to the King, he would have acted more in character, and might have preſerved his reputation, though he had loſt his power. But hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing offended the Governor, and diſguſted the Council and Aſſembly, he could hope for no favor from the Crown. When the report of the proceedings was ſent to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Sir William Aſhurſt, who had great
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023166_0025_0FBC771DA6825660"/>
intereſt at Court, and was a friend to New-England, and who greatly diſreliſhed the memorial which Vaughan had formerly preſented to the King,<note place="margin">Aſhurſt's letter MS.</note> eaſily found means to diſplace him; and in his room was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed JOHN WENTWORTH, Eſq. whoſe commiſſion was publiſhed on the ſeventh of December. The celebrated Mr. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſon, being then Secretary of State, this commiſſion is counterſigned by a name particularly dear to the friends of liberty and literature.<note place="margin">Orig. MS.</note>
            </p>
            <p>John Wentworth, Eſq. grandſon of William Wentworth, formerly mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as one of the firſt ſettlers of the country, had been in the early part of his life, commander of a ſhip; and had acquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a handſome fortune by mercantile in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. Without any ſuperior abilities or learning, by a ſteady attention to buſineſs, and a prudent obliging deportment, he had recommended himſelf to the eſteem of the people. Having been five years in the Council, before his appointment as Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Governor, he had carried the ſame uſeful qualities into public life, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved or increaſed that reſpect which he had acquired in a private ſtation. The rancour of contending parties made mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023166_0026_0FBC771EB93F3E30"/>
a neceſſary character in a chief magiſtrate; and the circumſtances of the Province, at that time, required a perſon of experience in trade, at its head.</p>
            <p>It being a time of peace, after a long and diſtreſſing war, the improvement of which the Province was capable, in regard to its natural productions, lumber and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val ſtores, roſe into view and became ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of cloſe attention both here and in England. As early as 1668, the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Maſſachuſetts,<note place="margin">Maſſ. Rec.</note> under which the Province then was, had reſerved for the public uſe all white pine trees of twenty-four inches in diameter, at three feet from the ground. In King William's reign, a ſurveyor of the woods was appointed by the Crown;<note place="margin">Council Minutes.</note> and an order was ſent to the Earl of Bellamont, to cauſe acts to be paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in his ſeveral governments for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the white pines. In 1708 a law made in New-Hampſhire prohibited the cutting of ſuch as were twenty-four inches in diameter,<note place="margin">Laws Chap. 20.</note> at twelve inches from the ground, without leave of the ſurvey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or; who was inſtructed by the Queen, to mark with the broad arrow, thoſe which were or might be fit for the uſe of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, and to keep a regiſter of them. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023166_0027_0FBC772037CA1AC0"/>

On the other hand, the people made as loud complaints againſt the ſurveyor, for prohibiting the cutting of pine trees, and yet neglecting to mark ſuch as were fit for maſts; by which means many trees, which never could be uſed as maſts, and might be cut into logs for ſawing, were rotting in the woods;<note place="margin">Penhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low's MSS.</note> or the people who got them were expoſed to a vexatious proſecution. When no ſurveyor was on the ſpot, the Governor and Council appointed ſuitable perſons to take care that no waſte ſhould be made of the maſt trees; and theſe officers, with a very moderate allowance, performed the duty, to much better purpoſe, than thoſe who were ſent from England and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at a great expenſe to the Crown.<note place="margin">Aſſembly Records.</note>

This was a difficult point. The Aſſembly, in 1704, during the controverſy with Allen, had explicitly diſclaimed all title to the waſte lands, by which they underſtood all thoſe without the bounds of their towns. The heirs of Allen kept a jealous eye up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them.

views, yet had an intereſt ſeparate from that of the public. The royal determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could not be had, but on an appeal from a verdict at law; but no ſuits were now pending; nor could the lands be granted by royal charter, without ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to intrench on the property of the claimants. Notwithſtanding theſe diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, the neceſſity of extending the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlements, and improving the natural ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of the country, was too apparent to be neglected.</p>
            <p>Great quantities of iron ore were found in many places;<note place="margin">1719.</note> and it was in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation to erect forges on ſome of the riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and to introduce foreign artiſts and laborers to refine it. A law was made laying a penalty of ten pounds per ton,<note place="margin">Laws Chap. 90.</note> on the tranſporting of it out of the province; but for the further encouragement of the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ufacture, it was deemed neceſſary, that ſome lands ſhould be appropriated, to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of ſupplying with fewel, the iron works which were to be erected,<note place="margin">Council Minutes.</note> on Lam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prey river, and of ſettling the people who were to be employed in that ſervice. On this occaſion, it was recollected, that in 1672, while this Province was ſubject to the Maſſachuſetts government, and after the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:023166_0030_0FBC7727C1574AD0"/>
town of Portſmouth had made a liberal contribution for the rebuilding of Harvard College, a promiſe had been made by the General Court to grant to that town a quantity of
<q>land for a village, when they ſhould declare to the court the place where they deſired it.<note place="margin">Maſſ. Rec.</note>
               </q>
Upon this, a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition was preſented to the Governor and Council praying for a fulfilment of this promiſe; and after ſome heſitation, a grant was made of a ſlip of land two miles in breadth,<note place="margin">Council Minutes.</note> above the head line of Dover, for the uſe of the iron works, which was called the
<q>renewing a grant former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly made.</q>
This was known by the name of the two mile ſlip, and it was afterward included in the townſhip of Barrington.</p>
            <p>In ſome parts of the Province, were many pitch pine trees, unfit for maſts, but capable of yielding tar and turpentine. A monopoly of this manufacture had been attempted by a company of merchants; but when many thouſand trees were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for uſe they were deſtroyed by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known hands.<note place="margin">Council Minutes.</note> 
               <note place="margin">Laws. Chap 19.</note> Afterward a law was made providing that tar ſhould be receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in lieu of taxes, at twenty ſhillings per barrel.

on the injuring of trees for drawing turpentine. But private intereſt was too ſtrong to be counteracted by a ſenſe of public utility. Too many inciſions being made in the trees at once, they were ſoon deſtroyed; and as thoſe which were near at hand became ſcarce, the manufacture was gradually diſcontinued.</p>
            <p>Hemp was another object. Some had been ſown, and from the ſpecimen of its growth, much advantage was expected. An act was made to encourage it;<note place="margin">Chap. 94.</note> and it was allowed to be received at the treaſury, in lieu of money, at one ſhilling per pound. But as there was ſcarcely land enough in cultivation, for the production of corn, it was vain to think of raiſing a leſs neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry commodity.</p>
            <p>The Parliament of England was atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the advantages which might be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to the nation from the Colonies, to which they were particularly incited by the war, which at this time raged between Sweden and Ruſſia, the grand marts for naval ſtores in Europe. A duty which had been paid on lumber imported from America, was taken off; and this was eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teemed ſo great a favor to New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire that the Aſſembly thanked Shute for<note place="margin">Aſſembly Records.</note>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:023166_0032_0FBC772ADA9D4F08"/>
the ſhare he had in obtaining it. About the ſame time, an act of Parliament was made for the preſervation of the white pines. Penalties in proportion to the ſize of the trees, were laid on the cutting of thoſe which grew without the bounds of townſhips; and for the greater terror, theſe penalties were to be recovered by the oath of one witneſs, in a court of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty; where a ſingle Judge, appointed by the Crown, and removeable at pleaſure, determined the cauſe without a Jury.<note place="margin">Statute of George I.

            <p>Great inconveniencies had ariſen for want of a due ſettlement of the limits of the Province. The people who lived near the ſuppoſed line, were ſometimes taxed in both Provinces, and were liable to arreſts by the officers of both; and ſome times the officers them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves were at variance, and impriſoned each other. Several attempts had been made to remove the difficulty, and letters frequently paſſed between the two Courts on the ſubject, in conſequence of petitions and complaints from the borderers. In
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:023166_0033_0FBC772C91781778"/>
1716, Commiſſioners were appointed by both Provinces, to ſettle the line. The New-Hampſhire Commiſſioners were fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by Lieutenant Governor Vaughan, with a copy of the report of the Lords Chief Juſtices in 1677,<note place="margin">Original MS in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.</note> and were inſtructed
<q>to follow the courſe of the river Merri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mack, at the diſtance of three miles north as far as the river extends.</q>
The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners on the other ſide complained that this power was not ſufficient;<note place="margin">MS letter Lt. Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth.</note> if by ſufficient it was meant that they had no power to vary from their inſtructions, the objection was true, but why this ſhould have been objected it is not eaſy to account, ſince the inſtructions would have given Maſſachuſetts all which they could claim by virtue of their old charter; or the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon it, on which they always laid much ſtreſs. Three years afterward the affair was agitated again, in obedience to an order from the Lords of trade; who directed a map to be drawn and ſent to them, in which the boundaries of the Province ſhould be delineated,<note place="margin">Original MS order.</note> and the beſt accounts and vouchers procured to elucidate it. Commiſſioners were again appointed to meet at Newbury;<note place="margin">Original MS in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions.</note> and thoſe from New-Hampſhire were inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Lieutenant Governor Wentworth
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:023166_0034_0FBC772FB6A48A68"/>
to confer with the others; and if they could agree, in fixing the place where to begin the line, they were to report accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly; but if not, they were to proceed <hi>ex parte</hi>
               <q>ſetting their compaſs on the north ſide of the mouth of Merrimack riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er at high water mark, and from thence meaſuring three miles on a north line, and from the end of the firſt three miles on a weſt line, into the country, till they ſhould meet the great river which runs out of Winipiſiogee pond.</q>
To this idea of a weſt line, the Maſſachuſetts Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners objected; and deſired that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the Governor of New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire might be ſent to Newbury, which was refuſed, and the conference ended without any agreement. However, a plan was drawn, agreeably to theſe inſtructions, and ſent to the Lords of trade; and New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man the agent was inſtructed to ſolicit for a confirmation of it. In theſe inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the ideas of the gentlemen in govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment are more fully expreſſed.<note place="margin">Penhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low's MSS.</note> The due weſt line on the ſouthern ſide of the Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince, they ſuppoſed, ought to extend as far as Maſſachuſetts extended. The line on the northerly ſide adjoining to the Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince of Maine, they ſuppoſed, ought to be drawn, up the middle of the river Paſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aqua,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:023166_0035_0FBC7730B61CF760"/>
as far as the tide flows in the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wichwannock branch; and thence north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſtward, but whether two or more points weſtward of north was left for further conſideration.</p>
            <p>While theſe things were in agitation, the Province unexpectedly received an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of inhabitants from the north of Ireland. A colony of Scots preſbyterians had been ſettled in the Province of Ulſter,<note place="margin">Hume.</note> in the reign of James I; they had borne a large ſhare in the ſufferings, which the proteſtants in that unhappy country un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent, in the reign of Charles I and James II; and had thereby conceived an ardent and inextinguiſhable thirſt for civil and religious liberty. Notwithſtanding the peace which Ireland had enjoyed, ſince the ſubjection of the Popiſh party by King William, ſome penal laws were ſtill in force; which, with the inconvenience of rents and tithes, made theſe people wiſh for a ſettlement in America; where they might be free from theſe burthens and have full ſcope for their induſtry. One Holmes, a young man, ſon of a clergyman, had been here and carried home a favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble report of the country,<note place="margin">MS of John Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vey.</note> which induced his father, with three other preſbyterian

Miniſters, James Macgregore, William Cornwell, and William Boyd, and a large number of their congregations, to reſolve on an emigration. Having converted their ſubſtance into money, they embarked in five ſhips,<note place="margin">Oct. 14. 1718.</note> and about one hundred fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies of them arrived at Boſton. Cornwell, with about twenty families more, arrived at Caſco. They immediately petitioned the Aſſembly of Maſſachuſetts for a tract of land; who gave them leave to look out a ſettlement of ſix miles ſquare, in any of the unappropriated lands at the eaſtward. After a fruitleſs ſearch along the ſhore, finding no place that ſuited them there; ſixteen families, hearing of a tract of good land, above Haverhill, called Nutfield (from the great number of cheſnut and walnut trees there) and being informed that it was not appropriated, determined there to take up their grant; the others diſperſed themſelves into various parts of the country.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as the ſpring opened, the men went from Haverhill, where they left their families,<note place="margin">April 11.</note> and built ſome huts near a brook which falls into Beaver River, and which they named Weſt-running brook. The firſt evening after their arrival, a ſermon was preached to them under a large oak,
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:023166_0037_0FBC7736D05BD9D8"/>
which is to this day regarded with a degree of veneration. As ſoon as they could col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect their families, they called Macgregore to be their miniſter, who ſince his arrival in the country had preached at Dracut. At the firſt ſacramental occaſion, were preſent two miniſters and ſixty-five com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municants. Macgregore continued with them till his death;<note place="margin">March 5, 1729.</note> and his memory is ſtill precious among them: He was a wiſe,<note place="margin">Ae<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Theſe people brought with them the neceſſary materials for the manufacture of linen; and their ſpinning wheels, turned by the foot, were a novelty in the country. They alſo introduced the culture of potatoes, which were firſt planted in the garden of Nathaniel Walker of Andover. They were an induſtrious, frugal and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently thriving people.</p>
            <p>They met with ſome difficulty in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a title to their lands. If the due weſt line between the Provinces had been eſtabliſhed, it would have paſſed through their ſettlement and divided it between Maſſachuſetts and New-Hampſhire<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but the curve line, following the courſe of Merrimack at three miles diſtance, would leave them unqueſtionably in New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.

This was the idea of the General Court of Maſſachuſetts, who, upon appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to them for a confirmation of their former grant, declared them to be out of their juriſdiction. Among the many claimants to theſe lands, they were inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that Col. Wheelwright of Wells had the beſt Indian title, derived from his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſtors. Suppoſing this to be valid in a moral view, they followed the example of the firſt ſettlers of New-England, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a deed of ten miles ſquare, in virtue of the general licenſe granted by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Sagamores in 1629. To prevent dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty from Allen's claim, they applied for leave of ſettlement to Col. Uſher, who told them that the land was in diſpute,<note place="margin">Uſher's MSS.</note> and that he could not give them leave, but that he ſuppoſed they might ſettle on it, if they would hold it either of the King or of Allen's heirs, as the caſe might be determined. They alſo applied to the Lieutenant Governor of New-Hampſhire, who declined making them a grant in the King's name; but, by advice of Council, gave them a protection, and extended the benefit of the law to them; appointing James McKean to be a Juſtice of the Peace,<note place="margin">Council Minutes.</note> and Robert Wier a Deputy Sheriff.</p>

               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:023166_0039_0FBC7739C738E468"/>Some perſons who claimed theſe lands,<note place="margin">1720.</note> by virtue of a deed of about twenty years date, from John, an Indian Sagamore, gave them ſome diſturbance; but, having obtained what they judged a ſuperior ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, and enjoying the protection of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, they went on with their planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; receiving frequent additions of their countrymen, as well as others, till in 1722, their town was incorporated by the name of Londonderry,<note place="margin">Harvey's &amp; Macgre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gore's MSS</note> from a city in the north of Ireland, in and near to which moſt of them had reſided; and in which ſome of them had endured the hardſhips of a mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orable ſiege.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>John Barr, William Caldwell and Abraham Blair, with ſeveral others who had ſuffered in this ſiege, and came to America, were by King William's ſpecial order made free of taxes through all the Britiſh dominions.</p>
                  <p>This, with ſeveral other circumſtances relating to theſe people, I took from a manuſcript letter written (1729) by Mr. John Harvey, ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſter in Londonderry, to Mr. Prince. In the ſame letter was the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing brief account of the ſeige above mentioned.
<q>Londonderry was beſieged near half a year (1689) by King James's army, when he had all Ireland ſubdued but Derry and a little place hard by. The beſieged defended the city, moſt of them being preſbyterians, till they were very much pinched by famine, that a dog's head was ſold cheap enough at half a crown; and yet God ſupported them until King Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam ſent them relief by two ſhips with men and proviſions from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; at which fight, before the ſhips got up to the city and landed their men, the beſiegers moved their camp and fled to the weſt of Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, where afterwards two bloody battles were fought and the papiſts ſubdued.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <q>Two things further (ſays he) I have to relate reſpecting Derry, 1. The church of Derry i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ſo ſtrongly built with ſtone and lime that in the ſteeple they had a cannon fixed, which did more hurt to the Iriſh army than ſix upon the walls. 2. There was one Col. Murray in the ſiege. He and a party were out againſt the enemy, and having got the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in an engagement with them a mile from the walls, the enemy's General, who was a Frenchman, and he, met; and having both fired their piſtols, drew their ſwords, and the General having a coat of mail, had the advantage of Murray, ſo that he could not hurt him. At length Murray obſerving that there was no touching him but through the harneſs in his face, put his ſword in through the bars of the harneſs and killed him. They made a great ſlaughter that day.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Nothing was more offenſive to theſe emigrants than to be called IRISH. Macgregore in a letter to Governor Shute, (1720) ſays:
<q>We are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed to hear ourſelves termed Iriſh people, when we ſo frequently ventured our all for the Britiſh Crown and liberties againſt the Iriſh papiſts; and gave all teſts of our loyalty, which the government of Ireland required, and are always ready to do the ſame when demanded.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The people of this country did not underſtand the diſtinction; nor in fact did they treat theſe ſtrangers with common decency on their firſt arrival. The grudge ſubſiſted a long time, but is now worn out.</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>The ſettlement of theſe emigrants, on the waſte lands, opened the way for other plantations. Thoſe who had borne the burthens and diſtreſſes of war, in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:023166_0040_0FBC773B65D21160"/>
the country, had long been circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed within the limits of the old towns; but were now multiplied, and required room to make ſettlements for their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. They thought it hard to be exclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the privelege of cultivating the lands, which they and their fathers had defended; while ſtrangers were admitted to ſit down peaceably upon them. Theſe were weighty reaſons. At the ſame time no attempt was making, by any of the claimants, to determine the long conteſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed point of property; and in fact, no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could give a clear and undiſputed title to any of the unſettled lands.</p>
            <p>In theſe circumſtances, a company of about one hundred perſons, inhabitants of Portſmouth, Exeter and Haverhill, pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioned for liberty to begin a plantation, on the northerly part of the lands called Nutfield.<note place="margin">1721.</note> Theſe were ſoon followed by petitioners from the other towns, for the lands which lay contiguous to them. The
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:023166_0041_0FBC773CB66EFF60"/>
Governor and Council kept the petitions ſuſpended for a long time, giving public notice to all perſons concerned to make their objections. In this time the lands were ſurveyed, and the limits of four pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed townſhips determined; and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were permitted to build and plant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the lands
<q>provided that they did not infringe on, or interfere with,<note place="margin">April 21.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Council Records.</note> any form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er grants, poſſeſſions or properties.</q>
Some of theſe lands were well ſtocked with pine trees; which were felled in great abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance; this occaſioned a freſh complaint from the King's ſurveyor.</p>
            <p>At length, charters being prepared, were ſigned by the Governor;<note place="margin">1722.</note> by which four townſhips, Cheſter, Nottingham,<note place="margin">May 10.</note> Barring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and Rocheſter were granted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corporated. The grants were made in the name of the King, who was conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the common guardian, both of the people and the claimants; but with a clauſe of reſervation, '<hi>as far as in us lies,</hi>' that there might be no infringement on the claims.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:023166_0042_0FBC774074D13D80"/>The ſigning of theſe grants was the laſt act of Government performed by Shute in New-Hampſhire. A violent party in Maſſachuſetts had made ſuch ſtrenuous oppoſition to him and cauſed him ſo much vexation, as rendered it eligible for him to aſk leave to return to England. He is ſaid to have been a man of a humane, obliging and friendly diſpoſition; but hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been uſed to military command, could not bear with patience the colliſion of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, nor keep his temper when provoked. Fond of eaſe, and now in the decline of life, he would gladly have ſpent his days in America if he could have avoided con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy. The people of New-Hampſhire were ſatisfied with his adminiſtration, as far as it reſpected them; and though they did not ſettle a ſalary on him as on his predeceſſor, yet they made him a grant twice in the year, generally amounting to a hundred pounds,<note place="margin">Aſſembly Records.</note> and paid it out of the exciſe which was voted from year to year. This was more in proportion, than he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from his other government.

            <p>TO account for the frequent wars with the eaſtern Indians, uſually called by the French, the Abenaquis, and their unſteadineſs both in war and peace; we muſt obſerve, that they were ſituated between the Colonies of two European na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, who were often at war with each other, and who purſued very different meaſures with regard to them.</p>
            <p>As the lands, on which they lived, were comprehended in the patents granted by the crown of England, the natives were conſidered by the Engliſh, as ſubjects of that crown. In the treaties and conferen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces held with them, they were ſtyled the King's ſubjects; when war was declared againſt them, they were called rebels; and when they were compelled to make peace, they ſubſcribed an acknowledgement of their perfidy, and a declaration of their ſubmiſſion to the government, without any juſt ideas of the meaning of thoſe
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:023166_0044_0FBC7743231838F0"/>
terms; and it is a difficult point, to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what kind of ſubjects they were.</p>
            <p>Beſide the patents, derived from the Crown, the Engliſh in general were fond of obtaining from the Indians, deeds of ſale for thoſe lands, on which they were diſpoſed to make ſettlements. Some of theſe deeds were executed with legal for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mality, and a valuable conſideration was paid to the natives for the purchaſe; oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers were of obſcure and uncertain original; but the memory of ſuch tranſactions was ſoon loſt, among a people who had no written records. Lands had been purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the Indian chiefs, on the Rivers Kennebeck and St. George, at an early pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod; but the ſucceeding Indians either had no knowledge of the ſales made by their anceſtors, or had an idea that ſuch bargains were not binding on poſterity; who had as much need of the lands, and could uſe them to the ſame purpoſe as their fathers. At firſt, the Indians did not know that the European manner of cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating lands, and erecting mills and dams, would drive away the game and fiſh, and thereby deprive them of the means of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence; afterward, finding by experience that this was the conſequence of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting foreigners to ſettle among them, they
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:023166_0045_0FBC7744365587D8"/>
repented of their hoſpitality, and were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to diſpoſſeſs their new neighbours, as the only way of reſtoring the country to its priſtine ſtate, and of recovering their uſual mode of ſubſiſtence.</p>
            <p>They were extremely offended by the ſettlements, which the Engliſh, after the peace of Utrecht, made on the lands at the eaſtward, and by their building forts, block houſes and mills; whereby their uſual mode of paſſing the rivers and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying-places was interrupted; and they could not believe, though they were told with great ſolemnity,<note place="margin">Governor Shute's conference 1717.</note> that theſe fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were erected for <hi>their</hi> defence againſt invaſion. When conferences were held with them on this ſubject, they either de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied that the lands had been ſold, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended that the Sachems had exceeded their power in making the bargains;<note place="margin">Waldo's defence of Loveret's title.</note> or had conveyed lands beyond the limits of their tribe; or that the Engliſh had taken advantage of their drunkenneſs to make them ſign the deeds; or that no valuable conſideration had been given for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe. No arguments or evidence which could be adduced would ſatisfy them, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs the lands were paid for again; and had this been done once, their poſterity after a few years would have renewed the demand.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="46" facs="unknown:023166_0046_0FBC7747F99B6BD8"/>On the other hand, the French did not in a formal manner declare them ſubjects of the crown of France;<note place="margin">Abbe Raynal.</note> but every tribe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſmall, was allowed to preſerve its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence. Thoſe who were ſituated in the heart of Canada kept their lands to themſelves, which were never ſolicited from them; thoſe who dwelt on the riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and ſhores of the Atlantic, though diſtant from the French Colonies, receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed annual preſents from the King of France; and ſolitary traders reſided with, or occaſionally viſited them; but no at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt was made by any company to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle on their lands.</p>
            <p>It was in the power of the Engliſh to ſupply them with proviſions, arms, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, blankets and other articles which they wanted, cheaper than they could purchaſe them of the French. Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor Shute had promiſed that trading houſes ſhould be eſtabliſhed among them,<note place="margin">1717.</note>

            <p>The inhabitants of the eaſtern parts of New-England were not of the beſt cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter for religion, and were ill adapted to engage the affections of the Indians by their example. The frequent hoſtilities on this quarter, not only kept alive a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of jealouſy and revenge in individuals, but prevented any endeavors to propagate religious knowledge among the Indians by the government; though it was one of the conditions of their charter; and though many good men wiſhed it might be attempted. At length Governor Shute, in his conference with their Sachems at Arrowſic, introduced this important buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by offering them in a formal manner, an Indian bible, and a proteſtant miſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary; but they rejected both, ſaying

They had one Church at Penobſcot, and another at Norridgwog, where Sebaſtian Rallè, a French Jeſuit, reſided. He was a man of good ſenſe, learning and addreſs, and by a compliance with their mode of life, and a gentle, condeſcending deportment, had gained their affections ſo as to manage them at his pleaſure.

He even made the offices of devotion ſerve as incentives to their ferocity, and kept a flag, in which was depicted a croſs, ſurrounded by bows and arrows, which he uſed to hoiſt on a pole, at the door of his church, when he gave them abſolution,<note place="margin">New Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>r<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:023166_0049_0FBC774C9794CDE0"/>With this Jeſuit, the Governor of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada held a cloſe correſpondence; and by him was informed of every thing tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted among the Indians. By this means, their diſcontent with the Engliſh, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſettlements made at the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, was heightened and inflamed; and they received every encouragement, to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert their title to the lands in queſtion, and moleſt the ſettlers, by killing their cattle, burning their ſtacks of hay, robbing and inſulting them. Theſe inſolencies diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged the people,<note place="margin">1720.</note> and cauſed many of them to remove. The garriſons were then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforced; and ſcouting parties were order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into the eaſtern quarter, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Col. Shadrach Walton. By this appearance of force, the Indians, who dreaded the power of the Engliſh, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained from open hoſtilities. They had frequent parleys with the commanders of forts, and with commiſſioners who viſited them occaſionally; and though at firſt they ſeemed to be reſolute in demanding the removal of the Engliſh, declaring that
<q>they had fought for the land three times, and would fight for it again;<note place="margin">Captain Penhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low's MSS.</note>
               </q>
yet when they were told that there was no alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive but perfect peace or open war, and that if they choſe peace they muſt forbear
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:023166_0050_0FBC774E2D4B8520"/>
every kind of inſult, they ſeemed to prefer peace; and either pretended ignorance of what had been done, or promiſed to make inquiry into it; and as an evidence of their good intentions, offered a tribute of ſkins, and delivered up four of their young men as hoſtages.</p>
            <p>This proceeding was highly diſreliſhed by the Governor of Canada; who renew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his efforts to keep up the quarrel, and ſecretly promiſed to ſupply the Indians with arms and ammunition; though as it was a time of peace between the two crowns,<note place="margin">Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon II. 263.</note> he could not openly aſſiſt them.</p>
            <p>The New-England governments; though highly incenſed, were not eaſily perſuaded to conſent to a war. The diſpute was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Indians and the proprietors of the eaſtern lands, in which the public were not directly intereſted. No blood had as yet been ſhed. Canſeau had been ſurpriſed and plundered, and ſome people killed there; but that was in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Nova-Scotia. Rallè was regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the principal inſtigator of the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans; and it was thought, that if he could be taken off they would be quiet. It was once propoſed to ſend the Sheriff of York County with a poſſe of one hundred and
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:023166_0051_0FBC774F79F864A0"/>
fifty men,<note place="margin">1721.</note> to ſeize and bring him to Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton; but this was not agreed to. The next ſummer, Rallè in company with Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine from Penobſcot, and Croiſil from Canada, appeared among the Indians, at a conference held on Arrowſic Iſland,<note place="margin">July.</note> with Capt. Penhallow, the commander of the garriſon, and brought a letter, written in the name of the ſeveral tribes of Indians, directed to Governor Shute; in which it was declared,
<q>that if the Engliſh did not remove in three weeks, they would kill them and their cattle, and burn their houſes.</q>
An additional guard was ſent down; but the government, loth to come to a rupture, and deſirous if poſſible to treat with the Indians ſeparately from the French emiſſaries, invited them to another conference, which invitation they treated with neglect.</p>
            <p>In the ſucceeding winter, a party under Col. Thomas Weſtbrooke was ordered to Noridgwog to ſeize Rallè. They arrived at the village undiſcovered, but before they could ſurround his houſe, he eſcaped into the woods, leaving his papers in his ſtrong box, which they brought off without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other damage. Among theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were his letters of correſpondence with the Governor of Canada, by which
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:023166_0052_0FBC775284E5B920"/>
it clearly appeared,<note place="margin">1722.</note> that he was deeply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in exciting the Indians to a rupture, and had promiſed to aſſiſt them.</p>
            <p>This attempt to ſeize their ſpiritual father, could not long be unrevenged. The next ſummer they took nine families from Merry-meeting bay,<note place="margin">June 13.</note> 
               <note place="margin">Penhal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low's Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an wars, p. 85.</note> and after diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſing ſome of the priſoners, retained enough to ſecure the redemption of their hoſtages and ſent them to Canada. About the ſame time they made an attempt on the fort at St. George's; but were repulſed with conſiderable loſs. They alſo ſurpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome fiſhing veſſels in the eaſtern har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; and at length made a furious at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack on the town of Brunſwick, which they deſtroyed. This action determined the government to iſſue a declaration of war againſt them, which was publiſhed in form at Boſton and Portſmouth.<note place="margin">July 25.</note>
            </p>
            <p>New-Hampſhire being ſeated in the boſom of Maſſachuſetts, had the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to ſerve, and bore a proportionable ſhare of all theſe tranſactions and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſes attending them. Walton, who firſt commanded the forces ſent into the eaſtern parts, and Weſtbrooke, who ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded him, as well as Penhallow, the commander of the fort at Arrowſic, were New-Hampſhire men; the two former
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:023166_0053_0FBC7754D914EDD0"/>
were of the Council. A declaration of war being made, the enemy were expected on every part of the frontiers; and the Aſſembly were obliged to concert meaſures for their ſecurity, after an interval of peace for about ten years.</p>
            <p>The uſual route of the Indians, in their marches to the frontiers of New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, was by the way of Winipiſeogee lake. The diſtance from Cochecho falls in the town of Dover, to the ſoutheaſt bay of that lake, is about thirty miles. It was thought that if a road could be opened to that place, and a fort built there, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my would be prevented from coming that way. Orders were accordingly iſſued, and a party of two hundred and fifty men were employed in cutting down the woods for a road; but the expenſe ſo far exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the benefit which could be expected from a fort at ſuch a diſtance, in the wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, to be ſupplied with proviſions and ammunition by land carriage, which might eaſily be interrupted by the enemy,<note place="margin">Aſſembly Records.</note> that the deſign was laid aſide, and the old method of defence by ſcouts and garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons was adopted. Lieutenant Governor Wentworth, being Commander in Chief in Shute's abſence, was particularly careful to ſupply the garriſons with ſtores, and viſit
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:023166_0054_0FBC7756FA6CE4D8"/>
them in perſon, to ſee that the duty was regularly performed; for which, and oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er prudent and faithful ſervices, he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently received the acknowledgments of the Aſſembly and grants of money, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally amounting to one hundred pounds at every ſeſſion, and ſometimes more. They alſo took care to inliſt men for two years, and to eſtabliſh the wages of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers and ſoldiers at the following rates; a Captain, at ſeven pounds per month; a Lieutenant, four pounds; a Sergeant, fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-eight ſhillings; a Corporal, forty-five ſhillings, and a private, forty ſhillings. A bounty of one hundred pounds was offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for every Indian ſcalp. The difference between the currency and ſterling, was two and an half for one.</p>
            <p>The firſt appearance of the enemy in New-Hampſhire,<note place="margin">723.</note> was at Dover; where they ſurpriſed and killed Joſeph Ham, and took three of his children; the reſt of the family eſcaped to the garriſon. Soon af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they waylaid the road,<note place="margin">Penhallow page 96.</note> and killed Triſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tram Heard. Their next onſet was at Lamprey River, where they killed Aaron Rawlins and one of his children,<note place="margin">Auguſt 29.</note> taking his wife and three children captive.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>
                     <q>This Aaron Rawlins (whoſe wife was a daughter of Edward Tay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lor, who was killed by the Indians 1704) lived upon the plantation left by Taylor, about half a mile weſt from Lamprey River landing, at the lower falls on Piſcaſick River. The people there at that time, commonly retired, at night, to the garriſoned houſes, and returned home in the day time; but that night they neglected to retire as uſual. His brother Samuel alſo lived about half a mile diſtant on the ſame river. It ſeems the Indian ſcout conſiſted of eighteen, who probably had been reconnoitering ſome time<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and intended to have deſtroyed both the families, and for that purpoſe divided, and nine went to each houſe; but the party that went to Samuel Rawlins's, beating in the window, and finding the family gone, immediately joined their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, who were engaged at Aaron's. His wife went out at the door, perhaps ſooner than they would otherwiſe have aſſaulted the houſe, and was immediately ſeized, and one or two of her children who fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her. Her huſband being alarmed, ſecured the door before they could enter, and with his eldeſt daughter, about twelve years old, ſtood upon his defence, repeatedly firing wherever they attempted to enter, and at the ſame time calling earneſtly to his neighbors for help; but the people in the ſeveral garriſoned houſes near, apprehending from the noiſe and inceſſant firing, the number of the enemy to be greater than they were, and expecting every moment to be attacked themſelves, did not venture to come to his aſſiſtance. Having for ſome time bravely withſtood ſuch unequal force, he was at laſt killed by their random ſhots through the houſe, which they then broke open, and kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led his daughter. They ſcalped him, and cut off his daughter's head, either through haſte, or probably being enraged againſt her, on account of the aſſiſtance ſhe had afforded her father in their defence, which ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idently appeared by her hands being ſoiled with powder. His wife and two children, a ſon and a daughter, they carried to Canada: The woman was redeemed in a few years. The ſon was adopted by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and lived with them all his days; he came into Pennycook with the Indians after the peace, and expreſſed to ſome people with whom he converſed, much reſentment againſt his uncle Samuel Raw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lins, on ſuppoſing he had detained from his mother ſome property left by his father, but manifeſted no deſire of returning to Newmarket again. The daughter married with a Frenchman, and when ſhe was near ſixty years old, returned with her huſband to her native place, in expectation of recovering the patrimony ſhe conceived was left at the deat hof her father: But the eſtate having been ſold by her grandfath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Taylor's adminiſtrator, they were diſappointed, and after a year or two went back to Canada.</q>

their corn field, went to a brook to drink, where they diſcovered three Indian packs. They immediately gave notice of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery to the volunteer company, and went before to guide them to the ſpot. The Indians had placed themſelves in am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buſh; and the unhappy father and ſon were both killed. The company then fir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, killed one and wounded two others,<note place="margin">Penhallow, p. 101.</note> who made their eſcape, though they were purſued and tracked by their blood to a conſiderable diſtance. The ſlain Indian was a perſon of diſtinction, and wore a kind of coronet of ſcarlet dyed fur, with an appendage of four ſmall bells, by the ſound of which the others might follow him through the thickets. His hair was remarkably ſoft and fine; and he had about him a devotional book and a muſter-roll of one hundred and eighty Indians; from which circumſtances it was ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that he was a natural ſon of the Jeſuit Rallè,<note place="margin">Hugh Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams's MS.</note> by an Indian woman who had ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him as a laundreſs.

One of theſe people, Ebenezer Downs, was taken by the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and was groſsly inſulted and abuſed by them, becauſe he refuſed to dance as the other priſoners did, for the diverſion of their ſavage captors. Another of them, John Hanſon, who lived on the outſide of the town, in a remote ſituation, could not be perſuaded to remove to a garriſon, though he had a large family of children. A party of thirteen Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, called French Mohawks, had mark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his houſe for their prey; and lay ſeveral days in ambuſh, waiting for an opportunity to aſſault it.

This was done ſo ſuddenly and ſecretly, that the firſt perſon who diſcovered it was the eldeſt daughter

at her return from the meeting before her father. Seeing the two children dead at the door, ſhe gave a ſhriek of diſtreſs, which was diſtinctly heard by her mother, then in the hands of the enemy among the buſhes, and by her brothers in the meadow. The people being alarmed, went in purſuit; but the Indians cauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly avoiding all paths, went off with their captives undiſcovered. After this diſaſter had befallen his family, Hanſon removed the remainder of them to the houſe of his brother; who, though of the ſame religious perſuaſion; yet had a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of luſty ſons, and always kept his fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms in good order, for the purpoſe of ſhooting game.<note n="*" place="bottom">This account is given as collected from the information of the family.

When her milk failed, ſhe ſupported her infant with water, which ſhe warmed in her mouth, and dropped on her breaſt, till the ſquaws taught her to beat the kernel of walnuts and boil it with bruiſed corn, which proved a nouriſhing food for her babe.

The ſucceſs of the forces at Norridgwog and the large premium of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered for ſcalps, having induced ſeveral volunteer companies to go out, they viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one after another of the Indian villa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, but found them deſerted. The fate of Norridgwog had ſtruck ſuch a terror into them, that they did not think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſafe at any of their former places of abode, and occupied them as reſting places only, when they were ſcouting or hunting.</p>
            <p>One of theſe volunteer companies, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of Capt.

They kept themſelves concealed till after mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night; when they ſilently advanced, and diſcovered ten Indians aſleep, round a fire, by the ſide of a frozen pond. Lovewell now determined to make ſure work; and placing his men conveniently, ordered part of them to fire, five at once, as quick after each other as poſſible, and another part to reſerve their fire: He gave the ſignal, by firing his own gun, which killed two of them; the men firing according to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, killed five more on the ſpot; the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er three ſtarting up from their ſleep, two of them were immediately ſhot dead by the reſerve; the other, though wounded, attempted to eſcape by croſſing the pond, but was ſeized by a dog and held faſt till they killed him. Thus in a few minutes the whole company was deſtroyed, and ſome attempt againſt the frontiers of New-Hampſhire prevented; for theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians were marching from Canada, well furniſhed with new guns, and plenty of

Here the ſurgeon was left with the ſick man, and eight of the company for a guard. The number was now reduced to thirty-four. Purſuing their march to the northward, they came to a pond, about twenty-two<note n="*" place="bottom">The printed accounts ſay FORTY; it is probable that the march was circuitous.</note> miles diſtant from the fort, and encamped by the ſide of it. Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the next morning, while at their devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,<note place="margin">May 8.</note> they heard the report of a gun, and diſcovered a ſingle Indian, ſtanding on a point of land, which runs into the pond, more than a mile diſtant. They had been alarmed the preceding night by noiſes round their camp, which they imagined were made by Indians, and this opinion was now ſtrengthened. They ſuſpected that the Indian was placed there to decoy them, and that a body of the enemy was in their front. A conſultation being held they determined to march forward, and by encompaſſing the pond, to gain the place where the Indian ſtood; and that they
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:023166_0065_0FBC776B3AF55E58"/>
might be ready for action, they diſencum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered themſelves of their packs, and left them, without a guard, at the northeaſt end of the pond, in a pitch-pine plain, where the trees were thin and the brakes, at that time of the year, ſmall. It hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened that Lovewell's march had croſſed a carrying-place, by which two parties of Indians, conſiſting of forty-one men, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Paugus and Wahwa, who had been ſcouting down Saco river, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to the lower village of Pigwacket, diſtant about a mile and a half from this pond. Having fallen on his track, they followed it till they came to the packs, which they removed; and counting them, found the number of his men to be leſs than their own: They therefore placed themſelves in ambuſh, to attack them on their return. The Indian who had ſtood on the point, and was returning to the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, by another path, met them, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their fire, which he returned, and wounded Lovewell and another with ſmall ſhot.

A ſmart firing commenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on both ſides, it being now about ten of the clock. Captain Lovewell and eight more were killed on the ſpot.

In this forlorn place they took their ſtation. On their right was the mouth of a brook, at that time unfordable; on their left was the rocky point; their front was partly covered by a deep bog and partly uncovered, and the pond was in their rear. The enemy gall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them in front and flank, and had them ſo completely in their power, that had they

made a prudent uſe of their advantage, the whole company muſt either have been killed, or obliged to ſurrender at diſcretion; being deſtitute of a mouthful of ſuſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and an eſcape being impracticable. Under the conduct of Lieutenant Wyman they kept up their fire, and ſhewed a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute countenance, all the remainder of the day; during which their chaplain, Jona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than Frie, Enſign Robbins, and one more, were mortally wounded. The Indians in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited them to ſurrender, by holding up ropes to them, and endeavored to intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date them by their hideous yells; but they determined to die rather than yield; and by their well directed fire, the number of the ſavages was thinned, and their cries became fainter, till, juſt before night, they quitted their advantageous ground, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off their killed and wounded, and leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dead bodies of Lovewell and his men unſcalped. The ſhattered remnant of this brave company, collecting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves together, found three of their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber unable to move from the ſpot, eleven wounded but able to march, and nine who had received no hurt. It was mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy to leave their dying companions behind, but there was no poſſibility of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving them.

deſired them to lay his gun by him charged, that if the Indians ſhould return before his death he might be able to kill one more. After the riſing of the moon, they quitted the fatal ſpot, and directed their march toward the fort, where the ſurgeon and guard had been left. To their great ſurpriſe they found it deſerted. In the beginning of the action, one man (whoſe name has not been thought worthy to be tranſmitted to poſterity) quitted the field, and fled to the fort; where, in the ſtyle of Job's meſſengers, he informed them of Lovewell's death, and the defeat of the whole company; upon which they made the beſt of their way home; leaving a quantity of bread and pork, which was a ſeaſonable relief to the retreating ſurviv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors. From this place, they endeavored to get home.

Colonel Tyng, with a company from Dunſtable, went to the ſpot, and having found the bodies of twelve, buried them, and carved their names on the trees where the battle was fought. At a little diſtance he found three Indian graves, which he opened; one of the bodies was known to be their warrior Paugus.

            <p>This was one of the moſt fierce and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate battles which had been fought with the Indians.

The fall of their commander, and more than one quarter of their number, in the firſt onſet, was greatly diſcouraging; but they knew that the ſituation to which they were reduced, and their diſtance from the frontiers, cut off all hope of ſafety from flight. In theſe circumſtances, prudence as well as valor dictated a continuance of the engagement, and a refuſal to ſurrender; until the enemy, awed by their brave re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, and weakened by their own loſs, yielded them the honor of the field.

He ſaid that he conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered them as an independent nation, and that the war was undertaken by them, in defence of their lands, which had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded by the people of New-England. The Commiſſioners in reply, informed him, that the lands for which the Indians had quarrelled, were fairly purchaſed of their anceſtors, and had been for many years inhabited by the Engliſh. They produced his own letters to the Governors of New-England, in which he had (incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtently, and perhaps inadvertently) ſtyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed theſe Indians
<q>ſubjects of the King of France.</q>
They alſo alleged the ſeveral treaties held with them as evidence that they had acknowledged themſelves ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the Britiſh Crown; and, to his great mortification, they alſo produced his own original letters to the Jeſuit Ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lè, which had been taken at Norridgwog, in which the evidence of his aſſiſting and encouraging them in the war was too flag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to admit of palliation. Farther to ſtrengthen this part of their argument, they preſented to the Governor, a Mohawk
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:023166_0074_0FBC777DA5503730"/>
whom they had met with at Montreal, who, according to his own voluntary ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment, had been ſupplied by the Governor with arms, ammunition and proviſion to engage in the war, and had killed one man and taken another whom he had ſold in Canada.</p>
            <p>In addition to what was urged by the Commiſſioners in general; Mr. Atkinſon, on the part of New-Hampſhire, entered into a particular remonſtrance; alleging that the Indians had no cauſe of contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy with that Province, the lands in queſtion being out of their claim. To this the Governor anſwered, that New-Hampſhire was a part of the ſame nation, and the Indians could make no diſtinction. Atkinſon aſked him why they did not for the ſame reaſon make war on the people of Albany? The Governor anſwered,
<q>The people of Albany have ſent a meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage to pray me to reſtrain the ſavages from moleſting them; in a manner very different from your demands:</q>
To which Atkinſon with equal ſpirit replied,
<q>Your Lordſhip then is the right perſon, for our Governments to apply to, if the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians are ſubject to your orders.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Finding himſelf thus cloſely preſſed, he promiſed to do what lay in his power
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:023166_0075_0FBC777EC7CA7220"/>
to bring them to an accommodation, and to reſtore thoſe captives who were in the hands of the French, on the payment of what they had coſt; and he engaged to ſee that no unreaſonable demands ſhould be made by the perſons who held them in ſervitude; as to thoſe who ſtill remained in the hands of the Indians, he ſaid, he had no power over them, and could not engage for their redemption. He com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained in his turn, of the Governor of New-York, for building a fort on the riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Onondago, and ſaid, that he ſhould look upon that proc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eding as a breach of the treaty of peace; and he boaſted that he had the five nations of the Iroquois ſo much under his influence, that he could at any time, cauſe them to make war up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſubjects of Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>The Commiſſioners employed themſelves very diligently in their inquiries reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the captives, and in ſettling the terms of their redemption. They ſucceeded in effecting the ranſom of ſixteen, and engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ten others. The Governor oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the French, who held them, to abate of their demands; but after all, they were paid for at an exorbitant rate. He was extremely deſirous, that the gentlemen ſhould have an interview with the Indians,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:023166_0076_0FBC7780652E0930"/>
who were at war; and for this purpoſe, ſent for a number of them from the vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage of St. Francis, and kept them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed in Montreal. The Commiſſioners had repeatedly told him, that they had no power to treat with them, and that they would not ſpeak to them unleſs they ſhould deſire peace. At his requeſt, the chiefs of the Nipiſſins viſited the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, and ſaid that they diſapproved the war which their children the Abenaquis had made, and would perſuade them to aſk for peace. After a variety of manoeu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres, the Governor at length promiſed the Commiſſioners, that if they would conſent to meet the Indians at his houſe, they ſhould ſpeak firſt. This aſſurance produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an interview; and the Indians aſked the commiſſioners whether they would make propoſals of peace? they anſwered, No. The Indians then propoſed, that
<q>if the Engliſh would demoliſh all their forts, and remove one mile weſtward of Saco river; if they would rebuild their church at Norridgwog, and <hi>reſtore to them their prieſt,</hi> they would be brothers again.</q>
The Commiſſioners told them that they had no warrant to treat with them; but if they were diſpoſed for peace, they ſhould have ſafe conduct to and from Boſton or Portſmouth; and the Governor promiſed
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:023166_0077_0FBC7781C5C4A388"/>
to ſend his ſon with them to ſee juſtice done. They anſwered, that
<q>this was the only place to conclude peace, as the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were near and could readily attend.</q>
The Governor would have had them recede from their propoſals, which he ſaid were unreaſonable, and make others; but fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Le Chaſe, a Jeſuit, being preſent, and acting as interpreter for the Indians, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed the matter ſo much that nothing more was propoſed. It was obſerved by the commiſſioners, that when they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with the Governor alone, they found him more candid and open to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, than when Le Chaſe, or any oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Jeſuit was preſent; and, through the whole of their negociation, it evidently appeared, that the Governor himſelf, as well as the Indians, were ſubject to the powerful influence of theſe eccleſiaſtics; of whom there was a ſeminary in Canada, under the direction of the Abbè de Bel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont.</p>
            <p>Having completed their buſineſs, and the rivers and lakes being clear of ice, the Commiſſioners took their leave of the Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor, and ſet out on their return, with the redeemed captives, and a guard of ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers, which the Governor ordered to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them, as far as Crown-point. They
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:023166_0078_0FBC778342350870"/>
went down the river St. Lawrence to the mouth of the Sorel, then up that river to Chamblee, and through the lakes to fort Nicholſon. After a pleaſant paſſage, of ſeven days,<note place="margin">May 1.</note> they arrived at Albany.</p>
            <p>Here they found Commiſſioners of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian affairs for the Province of New-York, to whom they communicated the obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which they had made in Canada, and what the Marquis de Vaudreuil had ſaid reſpecting the five nations, and the fort at Onandago. There being a deputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from theſe nations at Albany, they held a conference with them, and gave them belts; requeſting their aſſiſtance in eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing a peace with the Abenaquis. From this place Mr. Atkinſon wrote to M. Cav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anielle, ſon of the Marquis, acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the polite reception the Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers had met with from the family; ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joining a copy of the information which they had given to the Commiſſioners of New-York; and promiſing, that a due repreſentation ſhould be made, to the Kings of England and France, on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their negociation.</p>
            <p>The report of the Commiſſioners being laid before the Aſſemblies of Maſſachuſetts and New-Hampſhire, it was determined to proſecute the war with vigor. Orders
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:023166_0079_0FBC7786BB972C38"/>
were iſſued for the defence and ſupply of the frontiers, and for the encouragement of ranging parties,<note place="margin">Aſſembly Records.</note> both volunteers and militia. A petition was ſent to the King, complaining of the French Governor, and deſiring that orders might be given to the other Colonies of New-England, and to New-York, to furniſh their quotas of aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, in the further proſecution of the war; and letters were written to the Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor of New-York, requeſting that ſuch of the hoſtile Indians as ſhould reſort to Albany, might be ſeized and ſecured.</p>
            <p>The good effects of this miſſion to Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada were ſoon viſible. One of the Indian hoſtages who had been detained at Boſton through the whole war, together with one who had been taken, were allowed on their parole, to viſit their countrymen; and they returned with a requeſt for peace. Commiſſioners from both Provinces went to St. George's; where a conference was held, which ended in a propoſal for a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther treaty at Boſton. In the mean time, ſome of the enemy were diſpoſed for furth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er miſchief. Thoſe who had been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in taking Hanſon's family at Dov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, in a ſhort time after their redemption and return, came down with a deſign to take them again, as they had threatened
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:023166_0080_0FBC7789388F6A78"/>
them before they left Canada. When they had come near the houſe, they obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome people at work in a neighbouring field,<note place="margin">Sept. 15.</note> by which it was neceſſary for them to paſs, both in going and returning. This obliged them to alter their purpoſe, and conceal themſelves in a barn, till they were ready to attack them. Two women paſſed by the barn, while they were in it, and had juſt reached the garriſon as the guns were fired. They ſhot Benjamin Evans dead on the ſpot; wounded Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Evans and cut his throat; John Evans received a ſlight wound in the breaſt, which bleeding plentifully, deceived them, and thinking him dead, they ſtripped and ſcalped him: He bore the painful opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion without diſcovering any ſigns of life, though all the time in his perfect ſenſes, and continued in the feigned appearance of death, till they had turned him over, and ſtruck him ſeveral blows with their guns, and left him for dead. After they were gone off he roſe and walked, naked and bloody, toward the garriſon; but on meeting his friends by the way drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, fainting on the ground, and being covered with a blanket was conveyed to the houſe. He recovered and lived fifty years. A purſuit was made after the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy,
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:023166_0081_0FBC778AC78114E0"/>
but they got off undiſcovered, carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with them Benjamin Evans, junior, a lad of thirteen years old, to Canada, whence he was redeemed as uſual by a charitable collection.</p>
            <p>This was the laſt effort of the enemy in New-Hampſhire. In three months, the treaty which they deſired was held at Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,<note place="margin">Dec. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note> and the next ſpring ratified at Fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth. A peace was concluded in the uſual form; which was followed by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining all private traffic with the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, and eſtabliſhing truck-houſes in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient places, where they were ſupplied with the neceſſaries of life,<note place="margin">Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon II.318.</note> on the moſt advantageous terms. Though the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the whole, were loſers by the trade, yet it was a more honorable way of preſerving the peace, than if an acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment had been made to the Indians in any other manner.</p>
            <p>None of the other Colonies of New-England bore any ſhare in the expenſes or calamities of this war; and New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire did not ſuffer ſo much as in former wars; partly by reaſon of the more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended frontier of Maſſachuſetts, both on the eaſtern and weſtern parts, againſt the former of which the enemy directed their greateſt fury; and partly by reaſon of the
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:023166_0082_0FBC778C6EE67C28"/>
ſucceſs of the ranging parties, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly traverſed the woods as far north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward as the White Mountains. The militia at this time was completely train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for active ſervice; every man of forty years of age having ſeen more than twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years of war. They had been uſed to handle their arms from the age of childhood, and moſt of them, by long practice, had become excellent markſmen, and good hunters. They were well acquainted with the lurking places of the enemy; and poſſeſſed a degree of hardineſs and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trepidity, which can be acquired only by the habitude of thoſe ſcenes of danger and fatigue, to which they were daily expoſed. They had alſo imbibed from their infancy a ſtrong antipathy to the ſavage natives; which was ſtrengthened by repeated hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of blood and deſolation, and not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>literated by the intercourſe which they had with them in time of peace. As the Indians frequently reſorted to the frontier towns in time of ſcarcity, it was common for them to viſit the families whom they had injured in war; to recount the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of death and torture which had been practiſed on their friends; and when provoked or intoxicated, to threaten a rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etition of ſuch inſults, in future wars. To
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:023166_0083_0FBC778DB464FAA8"/>
bear ſuch treatment required more than human patience; and it is not improba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that ſecret murders were ſometimes the conſequence of theſe harſh provoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Certain it is, that when any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was arreſted, for killing an Indian in time of peace, he was either forcibly reſcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the hands of juſtice, or if brought to trial, invariably acquitted; it being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to impannel a jury ſome of whom had not ſuffered by the Indians, either in their perſons or families.</p>

            <p>DURING the war, the Lieutenant Governor had managed the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive department with much prudence; the people were ſatisfied with his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and entertained an affection for him, which was expreſſed not only by words, but by frequent grants of money, in the General Aſſembly. When he returned from Boſton,<note place="margin">1726.</note> where the treaty of peace was concluded,<note place="margin">January 5.</note> they preſented to him an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of congratulation, and told him that

               </q>
This addreſs was followed by a grant of one hundred pounds. He had, juſt before, conſented to an emiſſion of two thouſand pounds in bills of credit, to be paid, one half in the year 1735, and the other half in 1736. An exciſe was laid for three years, and was farmed for three hundred pounds.</p>

               <pb n="85" facs="unknown:023166_0085_0FBC7ED27A36E888"/>The diviſional line between the Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inces of New-Hampſhire and Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts was yet unſettled, and in addition to the uſual diſadvantages occaſioned by this long neglect, a new one aroſe. By the conſtruction which Maſſachuſetts put on their charter, all the lands three miles northward of the river Merrimack were within their limits. On this principle, a grant had formerly been made to Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Endicot, of ſome lands at Penacook; which had been the ſeat of a numerous and powerful tribe of Indians. The qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the land at that place invited the attention of adventurers from Andover, Bradford and Haverhill;<note place="margin">Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts Rec.</note> to whom a grant was made of a townſhip, ſeven miles ſquare; comprehending the lands on both ſides of the Merrimack, extending ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly from the branch called Contoo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cook. This grant awakened the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of others; and a motion was made in the Maſſachuſetts Aſſembly,<note place="margin">Dec. 21.</note> for a line of townſhips, to extend from Dunſtable on Merrimack, to Northfield on Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut river; but the motion was not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately adopted. The Aſſembly of New-Hampſhire was alarmed. Newman, their agent, had been a long time at the Britiſh Court, ſoliciting the ſettlement of the line,
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:023166_0086_0FBC7ED40D6D2628"/>
and a ſupply of military ſtores for the fort. Freſh inſtructions were ſent to him to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedite the buſineſs, and to ſubmit the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement of the line to the King. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee was appointed to go to Penacook, to confer with a committee of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts,<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>. Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire Rec.</note> then employed in laying out the lands, and to remonſtrate againſt their proceeding. A ſurvey of other lands near Winipiſeogee lake, was ordered; that it might be known, what number of town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips could be laid out, independently of the Maſſachuſetts claim. On the other hand, the heirs of Allen renewed their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, and one of them, John Hobby, petitioned the Aſſembly to compound with him for his claim to half the Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince; but the only anſwer which he could obtain was that 'the Courts of law were competent to the determination of titles,' and his petition was diſmiſſed.</p>
            <p>Both Provinces became earneſtly engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Maſſachuſetts propoſed to New-Hampſhire the appointment of commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, to eſtabliſh the line. The New-Hampſhire Aſſembly refuſed, becauſe they had ſubmitted the caſe to the King. The Maſſachuſetts people, foreſeeing that the reſult of this application might prove un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>favorable to their claim of juriſdiction,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:023166_0087_0FBC7ED72C0E7910"/>
were ſolicitous to ſecure to themſelves the property of the lands in queſtion. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, the propoſed line of townſhips being ſurveyed,
<q>pretences were encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged and even ſought after, to entitle perſons to be grantees.<note place="margin">Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon II.3<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of the officers and ſoldiers, who had been employed in expeditions againſt the Narraganſet Indians, and againſt Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada, in the preceding century, were ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted; and the ſurvivors of the late Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Lovewell's company,<note place="margin">Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts Rec.</note> with the heirs of the deceaſed, had a ſelect tract granted to them at Suncook. There was an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of gratitude in making theſe grants, and there would have been policy in it, had the grantees been able to comply with the conditions.<note place="margin">1727.</note> New-Hampſhire followed the example, and made grants of the townſhips of Epſom, Chicheſter,<note place="margin">May 18 &amp; 20.</note> Barn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead, Canterbury, Gilmantown and Bow. All theſe, excepting the laſt, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly within their limits; but the grant of Bow interfered with the grants which Maſſachuſetts had made, at Pena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cook and Suncook, and gave riſe to a liti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation, tedious, expenſive, and of forty years continuance.</p>
            <p>Theſe tracts of land granted by both Provinces were too numerous and exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive.
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:023166_0088_0FBC7ED95EF27088"/>
It was impracticable to fulfil the conditions, on which the grants were made. Had the ſame liberal policy prevailed here as in Pennſylvania, and had the importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of emigrants from abroad been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged, the country might have been ſoon filled with inhabitants; but the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Londonderry were already looked upon with a jealous eye, and a farther intruſion of ſtrangers was feared, leſt they ſhould prove a burden and charge to the community. People could not be ſpared from the old towns. Penacook was almoſt the only ſettlement which was effected by emigrants from Maſſachuſetts. A ſmall beginning was made, by the New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire proprietors, at Bow, on Suncook riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; but the moſt of the intermediate country remained uncultivated for many years. Schemes of ſettlement were indeed continually forming; meetings of propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etors were frequently held, and an avari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ſpirit of ſpeculating in landed prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty prevailed; but the real wealth and improvement of the country inſtead of being promoted were retarded.</p>

name of George II. The long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this Aſſembly was principally ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the abſence of Governor Shute, in whoſe adminiſtration it commenced; and the uncertainty of his return or the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of a ſucceſſor. It had been deemed a grievance, and an attempt had been made in 1724 to limit the duration of Aſſemblies to three years, in conformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to the cuſtom of England. At the meeting of the new Aſſembly,<note place="margin">Dec. 15.</note> the firſt buſineſs which they took up was to move for a triennial act. The Lieutenant Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor was diſpoſed to gratify them. Both Houſes agreed in framing an act for a tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ennial Aſſembly, in which the duration of the preſent Aſſembly was limited to three years (unleſs ſooner diſſolved by the commander in chief) writs were to iſſue fifteen days at leaſt, before a new election; the qualification of a repreſentative was declared to be a freehold eſtate of three hundred pounds value.<note place="margin">Edition of Laws in 1771, page 166.</note> The qualification of an elector was a real eſtate of fifty pounds, within the town or precinct where the election ſhould be made; but habitancy was not required in either caſe; the ſelectmen of the town, with the mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erator of the meeting, were conſtituted judges of the qualifications of electors,
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:023166_0090_0FBC7EDCA2C9B748"/>
ſaving an appeal to the Houſe of Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives. This act having been paſſed, in due form, received the royal approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and was the only act which could be called a conſtitution or form of Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, eſtabliſhed by the people of New-Hampſhire; all other parts of their government being founded on royal com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions and inſtructions. But this act was defective, in not determining by whom the writs ſhould be iſſued, and in not deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing the places from which Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſhould be called, either by name, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent or population. This defect gave birth to a long and bitter controverſy, as will be ſeen hereafter.</p>
            <p>The triennial act being paſſed, the Houſe were diſpoſed to make other alterations in the government. An appeal was allowed in all civil caſes from the inferior to the ſuperior court; if the matter in contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy exceeded one hundred pounds, anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er appeal was allowed to the Governor and Council; and if it exceeded three hundred pounds, to the King in Council. The appeal to the Governor and Council was firſt eſtabliſhed by Cutts's commiſſion, and continued by ſubſequent commiſſions and inſtructions. In Queen Anne's time, it was complained of as a grievance, that
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:023166_0091_0FBC7EDDB37FF1D8"/>
the Governor and Council received ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peals and decided cauſes, without taking an oath to do juſtice. An oath was then preſcribed and taken. The authority of this court had been recogniſed by ſeveral clauſes in the laws; but was diſreliſhed by many of the people; partly becauſe the judges who had before decided caſes, were gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally members of the Council; partly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe no jury was admitted in this court of appeal; and partly becauſe no ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution was known in the neighbouring Province of Maſſachuſetts. The Houſe moved for a repeal of the ſeveral clauſes in the laws relative to this obnoxious court; the Council non-concurred their vote, and referred them to the royal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. The Houſe perſiſted in their endeavors, and the Council in their oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition. Both ſides grew warm, and there was no proſpect of an accommodation. The Lieuteunant Governor put an end to the ſeſſion, and ſoon after diſſolved the Aſſembly by proclamation.</p>
            <p>A new Aſſembly was called; the ſame perſons, with but two or three exceptions,<note place="margin">1728.</note> were re-elected, and the ſame ſpirit ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in all their tranſactions. They choſe for their ſpeaker Nathaniel Weare, who had been ſpeaker of the former Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:023166_0092_0FBC7EE18F828908"/>
and having as uſual preſented him to the Lieutenant Governor, he negatived the choice. The Houſe deſired to know by what authority; he produced his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; nothing appeared in that, which ſatisfied them; and they adjourned from day to day without doing any buſineſs. After nine days they choſe another Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, Andrew Wiggin, and ſent up the vote, with a preamble, juſtifying their former choice. The Lieutenant Governor ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved the Speaker, but diſapproved the preamble; and thus the controverſy cloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, each ſide retaining their own opinion. The ſpeeches and meſſages from the chair, and the anſwers from the Houſe, during this ſeſſion, were filled with reproaches; the public buſineſs was conducted with ill humour, and the Houſe carried their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition ſo far as to paſs a vote for addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King to annex the Province to Maſſachuſetts; to this vote the Council made no anſwer. But as a new Governor was expected, they agreed in appointing a committee of both Houſes to go to Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and compliment him on his arrival.</p>
            <p>The expected Governor was WILLIAM BURNET, ſon of the celebrated Biſhop of Sarum, whoſe name was dear to the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of New-England, as a ſteady and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive

friend to civil and religious liberty. Mr. Burnet was a man of good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and polite literature; fond of books and of the converſation of literary men; but an enemy to oſtentation and parade. He had been Governor of New-York and New-Jerſey, and quitted thoſe Provinces with reluctance, to make way for another perſon, for whom the Britiſh Miniſtry had to provide. Whilſt at New-York, he was very popular, and his fame having reached New-England, the expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations of the people were much raiſed on the news of his appointment, to the Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of Maſſachuſetts and New-Hampſhire. Lieutenant Governor Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth characteriſed him in one of his ſpeeches as
<q>a gentleman of known worth, having juſtly obtained an univerſal regard from all who have had <hi>the honor</hi> to be under his government.<note place="margin">July 22.</note>
               </q>

He began with Maſſachuſetts, and held a long controverſy with the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral Court to no purpoſe. In New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, a precedent had been eſtabliſhed in the adminiſtration of Dudley, which was favorable to his views.

To this vote ſix of the Repreſentatives entered their diſſent.</p>
            <p>The Governor came but once into New-Hampſhire.

It was even propoſed, to reduce them to 'a more abſolute dependence on the crown;' but a ſpirit of moderation prevailed; and it was thought that Mr. JONATHAN BELCHER, then in England, being a native of the Province, and well acquainted with the temper of his coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen would have more influence than a ſtranger, to carry the favorite point of a fixed ſalary. His appointment, as Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of New-Hampſhire, was merely an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendage to his other commiſſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="96" facs="unknown:023166_0096_0FBC7EEB6969B710"/>Belcher was a merchant of large fortune and unblemiſhed reputation. He had ſpent ſix years in Europe;<note place="margin">Belcher's Letter to the Biſhop of Lincoln. MS.</note> had been twice at the Court of Hanover, before the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant ſucceſſion took place in the family of Brunſwick; and had received from the Princeſs Sophia, a rich golden medal. He was graceful in his perſon, elegant and polite in his manners; of a lofty and aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piring diſpoſition; a ſteady, generous friend; a vindictive, but not implacable enemy. Frank and ſincere, he was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely liberal in his cenſures, both in converſation and letters. Having a high ſenſe of the dignity of his commiſſion, he determined to ſupport it, even at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of his private fortune; the emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of office in both Provinces being inadequate to the ſtyle in which he choſe to live.</p>
            <p>Whilſt he was in England, and it was uncertain whether he would be appointed, or Shute would return, Wentworth wrote letters of compliment to both. Belcher knew nothing of the letter to Shute, till his arrival in America, and after he had made a viſit to New-Hampſhire, and had been entertained at the houſe of the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Governor. He was then informed, that Wentworth had written a letter to

Shute, of the ſame tenor as that to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. This he deemed an act of duplicity. How far it was ſo, cannot now be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. The perſuaſion was ſo ſtrong in the mind of Belcher, that on his next viſit to Portſmouth, he refuſed an invitation to Wentworth's houſe. This was not the only way in which he manifeſted his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure. When the affair of the ſalary came before the Aſſembly,<note place="margin">Aug. 31.</note> he not only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to make ſuch a compromiſe as Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net had done; but obliged the Lieutenant Governor under his hand, to 'quit all claim to any part of the ſalary, and to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that he had no expectation from, or dependence on the Aſſembly, for any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance, but that he depended wholly on the Governor.' The ſame ſalary was then voted, and in nearly the ſame words, as to his predeceſſor. He allowed the Lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Governor, the fees and perquiſites only which aroſe from regiſters, certificates, li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſes and paſſes, amounting to about fifty pounds ſterling.

Wentworth, his ſon, and Theodore Atkinſon, who had married his daughter, were at the head of the oppoſition. The latter was removed from his office of Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lector of the Cuſtoms, to make room for Richard Wibird; the Naval Office was taken from him and given to Ellis Huſke; and the office of High Sheriff, which he had held, was divided between him and Eleazer Ruſſell. Other alterations were made, which greatly offended the friends of the late Lieutenant Governor; but Belcher, ſatisfied that his conduct was agreeable to his commiſſion and inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, diſregarded his opponents and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended no danger from their reſentment. Atkinſon was a man of humor, and took occaſion to expreſs his diſguſt in a ſingular manner. The Governor, who was fond of parade, had ordered a troop of horſe, to meet him on the road, and eſcort him to Portſmouth.

            <p>MR. WENTWORTH was ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Lieutenancy by DAVID DUNBAR,<note place="margin">1731.</note> 
               <note place="margin">June 24.</note> Eſq. a native of Ireland and a reduced Colonel in the Britiſh ſervice; who was alſo deputed to be ſurveyor of the King's woods. This appointment was made by the recommendation of the Board of Trade; of which Col. Bladen was an active member, who bore no good will to Governor Belcher.<note place="margin">Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon II.224 379.</note> Dunbar had been commander of a fort at Pemaquid, which it was in contemplation to annex to Nova-Scotia. He had taken upon him to gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern the few ſcattered people in that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict, with a degree of rigor to which they could not eaſily ſubmit. This conduct had already opened a controverſy, between him and the Province of Maſſachuſetts; and it was very unfortunate for Belcher to have ſuch a perſon connected with both his governments. What were the merits, which recommended Dunbar to theſe ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:023166_0101_0FBC7EF4F7B3F2E0"/>
it is not eaſy at this time to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine; the only qualifications, which appear to have pleaded in his favor, were pov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty and the friendſhip of men in pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. He was an inſtrument of intrigue and diſaffection; and he no ſooner made his appearance in New-Hampſhire, than he joined the party who were in oppoſition to the Governor. Belcher perceived the advantage which his enemies would derive from this alliance, and made all the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in his power to diſplace him. In his letters to the miniſtry, to the Board of Trade, and to his friends in England, he continually repreſented him in the worſt light,<note place="margin">Belcher's MS letters.</note> and ſolicited his removal. It is not improbable, that his numerous letters of this kind, written in his uſual ſtyle, with great freedom and without any reſerve, might confirm the ſuſpicions, raiſed by the letters of his adverſaries, and induce the miniſtry to keep Dunbar in place, as a check upon Belcher, and to preſerve the balance of parties.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">July 10.</note>Within a few weeks after Dunbar's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Portſmouth, a complaint was drawn up againſt Belcher, and ſigned by fifteen perſons; alleging that his government was grievous, oppreſſive and arbitrary, and praying the King for his removal. This rouſed the Governor's friends, at
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:023166_0102_0FBC7EF67B19A768"/>
the head of whom was Richard Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, the ſecretary, who drew up a counter addreſs,<note place="margin">MS copies of Addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</note> and procured an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred names to be ſubſcribed. Both ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes reached England about the ſame time. Richard Partridge, Mr. Belcher's brother in law, in conjunction with his ſon Jonathan Belcher, then a ſtudent in the Temple, applied for a copy of the complaint againſt him, at the Plantation office, and obtained it;<note place="margin">Belcher's letters.</note> but could not get ſight of the letters which accompanied it, though, on the foundation of thoſe letters, a repreſentation had been made by the Board of Trade, to the King.</p>
            <p>The only effect which Dunbar's letters had at that time, was to procure the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of Theodore Atkinſon, Benning Wentworth and Joſhua Peirce, to be Counſellors of New-Hampſhire; and though Belcher remonſtrated to the Sec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retary of State againſt theſe appointments, and recommended other perſons in their room, he could not prevail, any farther than to delay the admiſſion of the two former for about two years; during which time, they were elected into the Houſe of Repreſentatives, and kept up the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion there. The recommendations, which he made of other perſons, were duly attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:023166_0103_0FBC7EF805774AC0"/>
to when vacancies happened; and thus the Council was compoſed of his friends, and his enemies. The civil officers, whom he appointed, were ſometimes ſuperſeded, by perſons recommended and ſent from England; and in one inſtance, a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for the naval office, in favor of a Mr. Reynolds, ſon of the Biſhop of Lincoln, was filled up in England, and ſent over with orders for him to ſign it; which he was obliged punctually to obey.</p>
            <p>From the confidential letters of the leading men on both ſides, which have fallen into my hands in the courſe of my reſearches, the views of each party may plainly be ſeen;<note place="margin">Belcher's Waldron<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>s Atkinſon's &amp; Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſon's letters MS.</note> though they endeavored to conceal them from each other. The Governor and his friends had projected an union of New-Hampſhire with Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts; but were at a loſs by what means to bring it into effect. The moſt deſirable method would have been, an unanimity in the people of New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, in petitioning the Crown for it; but as this could not be had, the project was kept out of ſight, till ſome favorable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity ſhould preſent.</p>
            <p>The other party contemplated not only the continuance of a ſeparate government, but the appointment of a diſtinct Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:023166_0104_0FBC7EFB66731BF0"/>
who ſhould reſide in the Province, and have no connection with Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts. The greateſt obſtacle in their way, was the ſmallneſs and poverty of the Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince, which was not able to ſupport a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman in the character of Governor. To remove this obſtacle, it was neceſſary to have the limits of territory, not only fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, but enlarged. They were therefore zealous, in their attemps for this purpoſe; and had the addreſs to perſuade a majori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the people, that they would be gain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers by the eſtabliſhment of the lines; that the lands would be granted to them and their children; and that the expenſe of obtaining the ſettlement would be ſo trif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, that each man's ſhare would not exceed the value of a pullet.</p>
            <p>The Governor's friends were averſe to preſſing the ſettlement of the line; and their reaſons were theſe. The controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy is either between the King and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his charter government of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts; or elſe, between the heirs of Maſon or Allen and the people of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts. If the controverſy be ſettled even in favor of New-Hampſhire, the lands which fall within the line, will be either the King's property, to be granted by his Governor and Council according to royal
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:023166_0105_0FBC7EFD18A82240"/>
inſtructions; or elſe the property of the heirs of Maſon or Allen, to be diſpoſed of by them. On both ſuppoſitions, the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of New-Hampſhire can have no prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty in the lands, and therefore why ſhould they be zealous about the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or tax themſelves to pay the expenſe of it?</p>
            <p>The Governor, as obliged by his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, frequently urged the ſettlement of the lines in his ſpeeches, and declared, that the Aſſembly of New-Hampſhire had done more toward effecting it, than that of Maſſachuſetts. A committee from both Provinces met at Newbury in the autumn of 1731,<note place="margin">Sept. 21.</note> on this long conteſted affair; but the influence of that party in Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, of which Eliſha Cooke was at the head, prevented an accommodation. Soon after this fruitleſs conference, the Repreſentatives of New-Hampſhire, of whom a majority was in favor of ſettling the line, determined no longer to treat with Maſſachuſetts; but to repreſent the matter to the King, and petition him to decide the controverſy.<note place="margin">Aſſembly Records.</note> Newman's com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion,<note place="margin">Oct. 7.</note> as agent, having expired, they choſe for this purpoſe, John Rindge, merchant, of Portſmouth, then bound on a voyage to London. The appointment
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:023166_0106_0FBC7EFDF77AF8F0"/>
of this gentleman was fortunate for them, not only as he had large connexions in England; but as he was capable of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing money, to carry on the ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The Council, a majority of which was in the oppoſite intereſt, did neither concur in the appointment, nor conſent to the petition.</p>
            <p>Mr. Rindge, on his arrival in England, petitioned the King in his own name,<note place="margin">1732.</note> and in behalf of the Repreſentatives of New-Hampſhire,<note place="margin">Feb. 28.</note> to eſtabliſh the boundaries of the Province; but his private affairs requiring his return to America, he did, agreeably to his inſtructions, leave the buſineſs in the hands of Capt. John Thomlinſon, merchant, of London; who was well known in New-Hampſhire, where he had frequently been in quality of a ſea commander. He was a gentleman of great penetration, induſtry and addreſs; and having fully entered into the views of Belcher's opponents, proſecuted the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of the line, 'with ardor and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence;' employing for his ſolicitor, Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinando John Parris; who being well ſupplied with money, was indefatigable in his attention. The petition was of courſe referred to the Lords of Trade, and Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Wilks the agent of Maſſachuſetts, was ſerved with a copy to be ſent to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents.</p>

               <pb n="108" facs="unknown:023166_0107_0FBC7EFFBB75B9B8"/>Whilſt the matter of the line was pend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the other ſide of the Atlantic, the parties in New-Hampſhire maintained their oppoſition; and were on all occaſions vilifying and abuſing each other, eſpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in their letters to their friends in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. On the one ſide, Belcher inceſſantly repreſented Dunbar, as the fomenter of oppoſition; as falſe, perfidious, malicious and revengeful; that he did no ſervice to the crown, nor to himſelf; but was
<q>a plague to the Governor and a deceiver of the people.</q>
He was alſo very liberal in his reflections, on his other oppoſers. On the other ſide, they repreſented him as un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly to the royal intereſt; as obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſettlement of the lines; conniving at the deſtruction of the King's timber, and partial to his other government, where all his intereſt lay; and that he had not even a freehold in New-Hampſhire. As an inſtance of his partiality, they alleged, that in almoſt every ſeſſion of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Maſſachuſetts, he conſented to grants of the diſputed lands,<note place="margin">1733.</note> to the people of that Province; by which means, their Aſſembly raiſed money, to enable their agent to protract the controverſy, that they might have opportunity to lay out more townſhips; while at the ſame time,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:023166_0108_0FBC7F034C8F7828"/>
he rejected a ſupply bill of the New-Hampſhire Aſſembly, and diſſolved them, becauſe that in it, they had made an appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priation for their agent. The truth was, that the Council did not conſent to the bill, becauſe they had no hand in appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the agent, and the bill never came be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Governor. The frequent diſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Aſſemblies was another ſubject of complaint; and in fact this meaſure never produced the deſired effect; for the ſame perſons were generally re-elected, and no reconciling meaſures were adopted by either party.</p>
            <p>The Governor frequently complained, in his ſpeeches,<note place="margin">1734.</note> that the public debts were not paid; nor the fort, priſon, and other public buildings kept in repair; becauſe of their failure in ſupplying the treaſury. The true reaſon of their not ſupplying it was, that they wanted emiſſions of paper money, to be drawn in, at diſtant periods; to this the Governor could not conſent, being reſtrained by a royal inſtruction, as well as in principle oppoſed to all ſuch practices. But one emiſſion of paper was made in his adminiſtration; and for its redemption a fund was eſtabliſhed in hemp, iron, and other productions of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. When a number of merchants and
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:023166_0109_0FBC7F04B9B573E8"/>
others had combined to iſſue notes, to ſupply the place of a currency, he iſſued a proclamation againſt them; and in his next ſpeech to the Aſſembly, condemned them in very ſevere terms. The Aſſembly endeavored to vindicate the character of the bills, but in a few days he diſſolved them, with a reprimand; charging them with trifling, with injuſtice and hypocriſy. It muſt be remembered, that his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints of an empty treaſury were not oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by any failure of his own ſalary, which was regularly paid out of the exciſe.</p>
            <p>Belcher revived the idea of his predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor Shute, which was alſo countenanced by his inſtructions, that he was virtually preſent in New-Hampſhire, when perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally abſent, and attending his duty, in his other Province; and therefore that the Lieutenant Governor could do nothing but by his orders. Dunbar had no ſeat in the Council, and Shadrach Walton be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenior member, by the Governor's or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſummoned them and preſided. He alſo held the command of the fort, by the Governor's commiſſion, granted paſſes for ſhips, and licenſes for marriage; and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived and executed military orders, as occaſion required. The Lieutenant Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor conteſted this point; but could not
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:023166_0110_0FBC7F06459B5550"/>
prevail; and finding himſelf reduced to a ſtate of inſignificance, he retired in diſguſt, to his fort at Pemaquid; where he reſided almoſt two years. The Governor's friends gave out that he had abſconded for debt, and affected to triumph over the oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as poor and impotent; but their complaints, ſupported by their agent Thomlinſon, and the influence of Bladen at the Board of Trade, made an impreſſion there much to the diſadvantage of Mr. Belcher; though he had friends among the miniſtry and nobility; the principal of whom was Lord Townſend, by whoſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence he had obtained his commiſſion.</p>
            <p>After Dunbar's return to Portſmouth, the Governor thought it good policy to relax his ſeverity; and gave him the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the fort, with the ordinary per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſites of office, amounting to about fifty pounds ſterling. Not content with this, he complained, that the Governor did not allow him one third of his ſalary. The Governor's ſalary was but ſix hundred pounds currency; he ſpent at leaſt one hundred, in every journey to New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, of which he made two in a year. At the ſame time Dunbar had two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds ſterling, as Surveyor General of the woods; which, with the perquiſites,
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:023166_0111_0FBC7F07B2AE6168"/>
amounting to one hundred more, were divided between him and his deputies. But it muſt be remembered that he was deeply in debt, both here and in England.</p>
            <p>The rigid execution of the office of Surveyor General had always been attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with difficulty; and the violent manner, in which Dunbar proceeded with treſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſers, raiſed a ſpirit of oppoſition on ſuch occaſions. The ſtatutes for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of the woods impowered the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor to ſeize all logs, cut from white pine trees, without licenſe; and it reſted on the claimant, to prove his property, in the court of Admiralty. Dunbar went to the ſaw-mills; where he ſeized and marked large quantities of lumber; and with an air and manner to which he had been accuſtomed in his military capacity, abuſed and threatened the people. That claſs of men, with whom he was diſpoſed to contend, are not eaſily intimidated with high words; and he was not a match for them, in that ſpecies of controverſy, which they have denominated <hi>ſwamp law.</hi> An inſtance of this happened at Dover, whith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he came, with his boat's crew, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move a parcel of boards, which he had ſeized. The owner, Paul Gerriſh, warned him of the conſequence; Dunbar threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:023166_0112_0FBC7F0AC3C126B0"/>
with death the firſt man who ſhould obſtruct his intentions; the ſame threat was returned to the firſt man who ſhould remove the boards. Dunbar's prudence at this time, got the better of his courage, and he retired.</p>
            <p>With the like ſpirit, an attempt of the ſame kind was fruſtrated at Exeter, whith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er he ſent a company in a boat to remove lumber. Whilſt his men were regaling themſelves at a public houſe, in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and boaſting of what they intended to do the next day; a number of perſons, diſguiſed like Indians, attacked and beat them; whilſt others cut the rigging and ſails of the boat, and made a hole in her bottom. The party not finding themſelves ſafe in the houſe, retreated to the boat, and puſhed off; but being there in dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſinking, they with difficulty regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſhore, and hid themſelves till morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when they returned on foot to Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth.</p>
            <p>This was deemed a flagrant inſult. Dunbar ſummoned the Council,<note place="margin">April 26.</note> and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained to them of the riotous proceedings at Exeter, where there was
<q>a conſpiracy againſt his life, by evil minded perſons, who had hired Indians to deſtroy him.</q>
He propoſed to the Council, the iſſuing
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:023166_0113_0FBC7F0CF1AF7B80"/>
of a proclamation, offering a reward to apprehend the rioters. The major part of the Council were of opinion, that no proclamation could be iſſued but by the Governor.<note n="*" place="bottom">This was alſo the Governor's opinion; and in his letters he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently aſſerts that Dunbar had no command in New-Hampſhire, whilſt he was in either of his governments. To be conſiſtent, he ſhould have maintained, that the Lieutenant Governor of Maſſachuſetts had no command whilſt he was in New-Hampſhire; but there occurs <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p>This tranſaction afforded matter for complaint, and a memorial was drawn up by Thomlinſon, grounded on letters which he had received. It was ſuggeſted, that the Governor's pretence to favor the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor was deceitful; that the rioters at Exeter were his greateſt friends; that the Council,<note place="margin">MS letters.</note> wholly devoted to him, would not adviſe to a proclamation till they had ſent to Boſton; that the proclamation was delayed; and when it appeared offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed no reward; though Dunbar had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to pay the money himſelf; and, that by reaſon of this delay and omiſſion, the rioters eſcaped with impunity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="unknown:023166_0114_0FBC7F0E8B7D5860"/>In juſtice to Mr. Belcher, it muſt be ſaid, that there was no delay on his part, the proclamation being ſent from Boſton within ſix days. It alſo appears, from the ſecret and confidential letters of the Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor, that he diſapproved the riot, and even called it rebellion; that he gave par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular orders to the magiſtrates, to make inquiry, and take depoſitions, and do their utmoſt to diſcover the rioters. If he did not advertiſe a reward, it was becauſe there was no money in the treaſury; and if Dunbar had been ſincere in his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to pay it, he might have promiſed it, by advertiſement. The true reaſon that the rioters were not diſcovered, was, that their plan was ſo artfully conducted, their perſons ſo effectually diſguiſed, and their confidence in each other ſo well placed, that no proof could be obtained; and the ſecret remained with themſelves, till the danger was over, and the government had paſſed into other hands.</p>
            <p>A law had been made, for holding the Inferior Court of Common Pleas, alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately in each of the four old towns; and the practice had been continued for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral years, much to the convenience and ſatisfaction of the people; but Dunbar remonſtrated againſt it, to the Board of
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:023166_0115_0FBC7F0FF2578708"/>
Trade, and moved for a diſallowance of the act, becauſe the people who had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed him in his office deſerved not ſo much favor. The act was in conſequence diſallowed, and the courts were afterward confined to Portſmouth.<note place="margin">1735.</note> The order for diſallowance, came to the hands of Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bar, who called a meeting of the Council, that they might adviſe to its publication. A majority of them would not conſent, till the original order was ſent to Boſton, and Governor Belcher directed the publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it. This tranſaction ſerved as matter of freſh complaint,<note place="margin">June 13.</note> and was alleg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an argument for the appointment of a Governor, who ſhould reſide conſtantly in the Province.</p>
            <p>To finiſh what relates to Dunbar. He was careſſed by the party in oppoſition to Belcher, under the idea that he had inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt enough in England, to obtain a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion for the government of New-Hampſhire. In 1737 he went to England to proſecute his deſign; where, by his old creditors, he was arreſted and thrown into priſon. Thomlinſon found means to liberate him; but perceived that he had neither ſteadineſs nor ability for the ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at which he aimed,<note place="margin">Thomlin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, MS.</note> nor intereſt enough to obtain it; though, by his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:023166_0116_0FBC7F13B2572948"/>
in England, he ſerved to keep up the oppoſition to Belcher, and was uſed as a tool for that purpoſe, till the object was accompliſhed. After which he was (1743) appointed, by the Eaſt India Company, Governor of St. Helena.</p>
            <p>The trade of the Province at this time conſiſted chiefly in the exportation of lumber and fiſh to Spain and Portugal, and the Caribbee Iſlands. The maſt trade was wholly confined to Great Britain. In the winter ſmall veſſels went to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern Colonies,<note place="margin">Belcher's Letters to the Board of Trade. MS.</note> with Engliſh and Weſt India goods, and returned with corn and pork. The manufacture of iron within the Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince, which had been ſet up by the late Lieutenant Governor Wentworth, and other gentlemen, lay under diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for want of experienced and induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious workmen. The woollen manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was diminiſhed, and ſheep were ſcarc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than formerly; the common lands on which they uſed to feed, being fenced in by the proprietors. The manufacture of linen was much increaſed by means of the emigrants from Ireland, who were ſkilled in that buſineſs. No improvements were made in agriculture, and the newly grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed townſhips were not cultivated with ſpirit or ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="118" facs="unknown:023166_0117_0FBC7F15420DE4E8"/>There had not been any ſettled Epiſcopal Church in the Province from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, till about the year 1732; when ſome gentlemen who were fond of the mode of divine worſhip, in the Church of England, contributed to the erection of a neat build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on a commanding eminence, in Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, which they called the Queen's Chapel. Mr. Thomlinſon was greatly inſtrumental of procuring them aſſiſtance in England, toward completing and fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing it. It was conſecrated in 1734; and in 1736 they obtained Mr. Arthur Browne for their miniſter, with a ſalary from the ſociety for propagating the goſpel in foreign parts.</p>
            <p>About this time, the country was viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a new epidemic diſeaſe, which has obtained the name of the <hi>throat diſtemper.</hi> The general deſcription of it is a ſwelled throat, with white or aſh-colored ſpecks, an effloreſcence on the ſkin, great debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the whole ſyſtem, and a ſtrong ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to putridity. Its firſt appearance was in May 1735, at Kingſton in New-Hampſhire,<note place="margin">Douglaſs's practical hiſtory of a new milia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fever.</note> an inland town, ſituate on a low plain. The firſt perſon ſeized, was a child, who died in three days. About a week after,<note place="margin">Fitch's Narrative.</note> in another family, at the diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of four miles, three children were
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:023166_0118_0FBC7F16B42240A0"/>
ſucceſſively attacked, who alſo died on the third day. It continued ſpreading grad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually, in that townſhip, through the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and of the firſt forty who had it, none recovered. In Auguſt it began to make its appearance at Exeter, ſix miles north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſtward; and in September, at Boſton,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>
                     <p>On its firſt appearance in Boſton, it was ſuppoſed to be nothing more than a common cold; but when the report of the mortality in New-Hampſhire was received, and a young man from Exeter, whoſe brother had died of it, was ſeized (October 1735) the houſe was ſhut and guarded, and a general alarm ſpread through the neighbouring towns and colonies. Upon his death, no infection was obſerved in that houſe or neighbourhood; but the diſtemper appeared in other places, which had no communication with the ſick. The phyſicians did not take the infection, nor convey it to their families, nor their other patients. It was therefore concluded, that it was not like the ſmall pox, or the plague, communicable by infection, from the ſick or from clothes; and the phyſicians, having by deſire of the ſelectmen, held a conſultation, publiſhed their opinion; that it proceeded entirely from 'ſome occult quality in the air.'</p>

                  <p>Dr. Douglaſs computes the number of perſons who had the diſtemper in Boſton at 4000; of whom 114 died, which is one in 35. The whole number of inhabitants at that time was eſtimated at 16,000.</p>
               </note> fifty miles ſouthward, though it was Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober, before it reached Cheſter, the near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſettlement on the weſt of Kingſton. It continued its ravages through the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding winter and ſpring, and did not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appear till the end of the next ſummer.</p>
            <p>The moſt, who died of this peſtilence, were children; and the diſtreſs, which it occaſioned, was heightened to the moſt poignant degree. From three to ſix chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:023166_0119_0FBC7F183390B2E8"/>
were loſt out of ſome families; ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral buried four in a day, and many loſt their all. In ſome towns, one in three, and in others one in four of the ſick were carried off. In the pariſh of Hampton-Falls it raged moſt violently. Twenty families buried all their children. Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſeven perſons were loſt out of five fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies; and more than one ſixth part of the inhabitants of that place died within thirteen months. In the whole Province, not leſs than one thouſand perſons, of whom above nine hundred were under twenty years of age, fell victims to this raging diſtemper.</p>
            <p>Since the ſettlement of this country ſuch a mortality had not been known. It was obſerved, that the diſtemper proved moſt fatal, when plentiful evacuations, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly bleeding, were uſed; a great proſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſtrength being an invariable ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. The ſummer of 1735, when the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs began, was unuſually wet and cold, and the eaſterly wind greatly prevailed. But it was acknowledged to be, not
<q>a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſeaſons;</q>
as it raged through every part of the year. Its extent is ſaid to have been 'from Pemaquid to Carolina;' but with what virulence it raged, or in what meaſure it proved fatal, to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of New-England, does not appear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="121" facs="unknown:023166_0120_0FBC7F1C90276FE0"/>The ſame diſtemper has made its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at various times ſince. In 1754 and 1755, it produced a great mortality in ſeveral parts of New-Hampſhire, and the neighbouring parts of Maſſachuſetts. Since that time it has either put on a mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er form, or phyſicians have become better acquainted with it. The laſt time of its general ſpreading was in 1784, 5, 6 and 7. It was firſt ſeen at Sanford in the county of York; and thence diffuſed itſelf, very ſlowly, through moſt of the towns of New-England; but its virulence, and the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tality which it cauſed, were comparatively inconſiderable.
<q>Its remote,<note place="margin">Dr. Hall Jackſon's Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, 1786</note> or prediſpoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſe, is one of thoſe myſteries in nature, which baffle human inquiry.</q>

            <head>CHAP. XVII. State of parties. Controverſy about lines. Commiſſioners appointed. Their ſeſſion and reſult. Appeals. Complaints.</head>
            <p>WE have now come to that part of the Hiſtory of New-Hampſhire, in which may be ſeen, operating in a ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſphere, the ſame ſpirit of intrigue which has frequently influenced the conduct of princes, and determined the fate of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Whilſt on the one hand, we ſee Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts ſtiffly aſſerting her chartered claims; and looking with contempt, on the ſmall Province of New-Hampſhire, over which ſhe had formerly exerciſed ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction; we ſhall ſee, on the other hand, New-Hampſhire aiming at an equal rank, and contending with her for a large por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of territory; not depending ſolely on argument; but ſeeking her refuge in the royal favor, and making intereſt with the ſervants of the Crown. Had the contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy been decided by a court of law, the claims of Maſſachuſetts would have had as much weight, as thoſe of an indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual, in a caſe of private property; but the queſtion being concerning a line of
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:023166_0123_0FBC7F2206CD5158"/>
juriſdiction, it was natural to expect a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, agreeable to the rules of policy and convenience; eſpecially where the tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal itſelf was a party concerned.</p>
            <p>It muſt be obſerved, that the party in New-Hampſhire, who were ſo earneſtly engaged in the eſtabliſhment of the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary lines, had another object in view, to which this was ſubordinate. Their avowed intention was to finiſh a long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy, which had proved a ſource of inconvenience to the people who reſided on the diſputed lands, or thoſe who ſought an intereſt in them; but their ſecret deſign was to diſplace Belcher, and obtain a Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor who ſhould have no connexion with Maſſachuſetts. To accompliſh the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal, it was neceſſary that the ſubordinate object ſhould be vigoroſly purſued. The Government of New-Hampſhire, with a ſalary of ſix hundred pounds, and perqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſites amounting to two hundred pounds more, equal in the whole to about eight hundred dollars per annum, was thought to be not worthy the attention of any gentleman; but if the lines could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended on both ſides, there would be at once an increaſe of territory, and a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of ſpeculating in landed property; and in future there would be an increaſe
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:023166_0124_0FBC7F2436893E20"/>
of cultivation, and conſequently of ability to ſupport a Governor.</p>
            <p>The people were told that the lands would be granted to them; and by this bait they were induced to favor the plan; whilſt the miniſtry in England, were flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered with the idea, of an increaſe of crown influence in the plantations.</p>
            <p>The leading men in Maſſachuſetts were aware of the views of thoſe in New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and determined to guard againſt them. They preſumed, that a line of ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſdiction would not affect property; and therefore endeavored to ſecure the lands to themſelves, by poſſeſſion and improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as far as it was practicable. The ſame idea prevailed among the Governor's friends in New-Hampſhire. They per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that a tract of wilderneſs on the north eaſtern ſide of Merrimack River, and the ponds which flow into it, muſt doubtleſs fall into New-Hampſhire. For theſe lands they petitioned the Governor, and a charter was prepared, in which this whole tract, called King's-Wood, was granted to them. It contained all the lands not before granted, between the bounds of New-Hampſhire on the ſouth-weſt and north-eaſt; which, according to the ideas of thoſe concerned, would have been ſufficient for about four large town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips.</p>

               <pb n="126" facs="unknown:023166_0125_0FBC7F25B38E9008"/>Governor Belcher had a difficult part to act. He was at the head of two rival Provinces; he had friends in both, who were ſeeking their own as well as the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic intereſt: He had enemies in both, who were watching him, eager to lay hold on the moſt trivial miſtake, and magnify it to his diſadvantage. His own intereſt was to preſerve his commiſſion, and counter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act the machinations of his enemies; but as the ſettlement of the line, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving of him from his office, were car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on at the ſame time, and by the ſame perſons, it was difficult for him to oppoſe the latter, without ſeeming to oppoſe the former. Beſides, Mr. Wilks, the agent of Maſſachuſetts, was well known to be his friend; and when it was found neceſſary to increaſe the number, one of them was his brother, Mr. Partridge. On the other hand, Mr. Rindge and Mr. Thomlinſon were his avowed enemies. There was alſo a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the mode of appointing theſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents. Thoſe of Maſſachuſetts were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted by the Council and Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, with the Governor's conſent. Thoſe of New-Hampſhire were choſen by the Repreſentatives only, the Council non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concurring in the choice; which, of courſe,
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:023166_0126_0FBC7F273339EC10"/>
could not be ſanctioned by the Governor's ſignature, nor by the ſeal of the Province.</p>
            <p>When the petition which Rindge pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the King,<note place="margin">1732.</note> had been referred to the Board of Trade, and a copy of it giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to Wilks, to be ſent to his conſtituents, it became neceſſary that they ſhould in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct him. Their inſtructions were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly expreſſed in ſuch ambiguous terms,<note place="margin">Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon II, 385. Wilks's petitions &amp; report of Board of Trade MS.</note> that he was left to gueſs their mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and afterward blamed for not obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their directions. His embarraſſment on this occaſion, expreſſed in his peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and counter petition, to the Board of Trade, protracted the buſineſs, and gave it a complexion, unfavorable to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituents, but extremely favorable to the deſign of New-Hampſhire.</p>
            <p>To bring forward the controverſy,<note place="margin">1733.</note> Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris, the ſolicitor for the agents of New-Hampſhire, moved a queſtion,<note place="margin">Printed brief. MS report.</note>
               <q>From what part of Merrimack river the line ſhould begin?</q>
The Board of Trade re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred this queſtion, to the Attorney and Solicitor General, who appointed a day to hear council on both ſides. The council for New-Hampſhire inſiſted, that the line ought to begin three miles north of the mouth of the Merrimack. The council for Maſſachuſetts declared, that in their opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:023166_0127_0FBC7F2A223BBBA0"/>
the ſolution of this queſtion would not determine the controverſy, and therefore declined ſaying any thing upon it. The attorney and ſolicitor reported, that
<q>whether this were ſo or not,<note place="margin">1734.</note> they could not judge; but as the queſtion had been referred to them,<note place="margin">Jan. 5.</note> they were of opinion, that according to the charter of Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am and Mary, the dividing line ough<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> to be taken, from three miles north of the mouth of Merrimack, where it run into the ſea.</q>
Copies of this opinion were given to each party; and the Lords of Trade reported,<note place="margin">1735.</note> that the King ſhould ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point Commiſſioners, from the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Provinces,<note place="margin">June 5.</note> to mark out the dividing line. This report was approved by the Lords of Council.</p>
            <p>Much time was ſpent in references, meſſages and petitions, concerning the adjuſtment of various matters;<note place="margin">1737.</note> and at length,<note place="margin">Feb. 4 &amp; 9.</note> the principal heads of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion were determined. The firſt was, that the commiſſioners ſhould be appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from among the Counſellors of New-York, New-Jerſey, Rhode-Iſland and No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>va-Scotia. Theſe were all royal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, except Rhode-Iſland; and with that Colony, as well as New-York, Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts had a controverſy, reſpecting
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:023166_0128_0FBC7F2BC7C14678"/>
boundaries. Connecticut, though propoſed, was deſignedly omitted, becauſe it was imag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ined that they would be partial to Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, from the ſimilarity of their habits and intereſts. The other points were, that twenty commiſſioners ſhould be nominat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of whom five were to be a quorum; that they ſhould meet at Hampton, in New-Hampſhire, on the firſt of Auguſt,<note place="margin">Printed brief.</note> 1737; that each Province ſhould ſend to the Commiſſioners, <hi>at their firſt meeting,</hi> the names of two public officers, on whom any notice, ſummons, or final judgment might be ſerved; and at the ſame time ſhould exhibit, in writing, a plain and full ſtate of their reſpective claims, copies of which ſhould be mutually exchanged; and that if either Province ſhould neglect to ſend in the names of their officers, or the full ſtate of their demands, at the time appointed, then the Commiſſioners ſhould proceed <hi>ex parte.</hi> That when the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners ſhould have made and ſigned their final determination, they ſhould ſend copies to the public officers, of each Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince; and then ſhould adjourn for ſix weeks, that either party might enter their appeal.</p>
            <p>Theſe points being determined; the Board of Trade wrote letters to Belcher,<note place="margin">Feb. 18.</note>
               <pb n="130" facs="unknown:023166_0129_0FBC7F2D347A3C10"/>
encloſing the heads of the propoſed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and directing him to recommend to the Aſſemblies of each Province, to chooſe their public officers, and prepare their demands, by the time when the Commiſſioners were to meet. Theſe were accompanied with letters to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of the ſeveral Provinces, from which the Commiſſioners were elected, inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them of their appointment. The letters were delivered to Parris, and by him to Thomlinſon,<note place="margin">Original letters of Parris.</note> to be ſent by the firſt ſhip to America. Thoſe to Maſſachuſetts and New-Hampſhire, were directed, the one to Mr. Belcher, by name, as Governor of Maſſachuſetts; the other, to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief, <hi>reſident</hi> in New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire; and it was required that the delivery of the letters ſhould be certified by affidavit. The deſign of this ſingular injunction was, that Dunbar, if preſent, ſhould receive the letter, and call the Aſſembly of New-Hampſhire immediately; and that if Belcher ſhould forbid or hinder it, the blame of the neglect ſhould fall on him. At the ſame time another letter, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a petition of a borderer on the line, and containing a reprimand to Belcher, was ſent in the ſame manner, to be deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered by Dunbar, into Belcher's hands.
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:023166_0130_0FBC7F2ED209DFC8"/>
Theſe intended affronts, both failed of their effect; Dunbar having, before the arrival of the letters, taken his paſſage to England.</p>
            <p>The anxiety of Thomlinſon, to have the earlieſt notice poſſible, of the intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed commiſſion ſent to New-Hampſhire, led him not only to forward the public letters; but to ſend copies of all the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, to his friends there.<note place="margin">Feb. 15.</note> In a letter to Wiggen and Rindge (the committee who correſponded with him) he adviſed them, to make the neceſſary preparations,<note place="margin">Original MS letter.</note> as ſoon as poſſible, to act in conformity to the commiſſion and inſtructions; and even went ſo far as to nominate the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, whom they ſhould appoint, to man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age their cauſe before the Commiſſioners.</p>
            <p>Theſe papers were communicated to the Aſſembly, at their ſeſſion in March;<note place="margin">March 18.</note> and at the ſame time the Governor laid before them, a copy of the report of the Board of Trade, in favor of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, which had been made in the preceding December.

This appointment was made by the unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed voice of the Council and Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, and conſented to by the Governor; and though it was made, three weeks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reception of the letters, from the Lords of Trade, directing the appointing of public officers, and preparing a ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of claims; yet it was underſtood to be a full compliance with the orders and expectations of the government in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</p>
            <p>The ſame day on which this order paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, the Governor prorogued the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to the ſixth of July; and on the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth of June he prorogued it again, to the fourth of Auguſt.</p>
            <p>The letters reſpecting the commiſſion, were delivered to Mr. Belcher, on the twenty-ſecond of April; and he acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the receipt of them, in a letter to the Board of Trade, on the tenth of May.

            <p>Conſidering the temper and views of Mr. Belcher's opponents, this was rather unfortunate for him, ſo ſoon after his profeſſion of being 'a common father to both Provinces.' For if the committee had a right to nominate the two officers, then his recommendation was needleſs; if they had not, it might juſtly be aſked, why did he not call the Aſſemb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>y together, on the ſixth of July, to which day they had been prorogued? The excuſe was,
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:023166_0140_0FBC7F42F9695B70"/>
that he did it, to avoid any objection, which might be made to the regularity of their appointment; and to give them an opportunity to ratify and confirm it. The truth was, that Mr. Belcher highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the conduct of the committee of New-Hampſhire, who concealed the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and never communicated it to him in form. Had he been aware of the uſe, which his enemies might make, of his rigid adherence to forms, when he could not but know the contents of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, and the time when it muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, prudence might have dictated a more flexible conduct. They did not fail, to make the utmoſt advantage of his miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes, to ſerve the main cauſe which they had in view.</p>
            <p>The expreſſes which were ſent by Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts, to call the other Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, had no other effect than to add to the number, Philip Livingſtone, from New-York; who, being ſenior in nomination, preſided in the Court.</p>
            <p>To prevent the delay, which would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidably attend the taking of plans from actual ſurveys; the Commiſſioners recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, to both Aſſemblies, to agree upon a plan, by which the pretenſions of each Province ſhould be underſtood; but as
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:023166_0141_0FBC7F448827F3A0"/>
this could not be done, a plan drawn by Mitchel was accepted, and when their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult was made this plan was annexed to it. They then proceeded to hear the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwers, which each party made, to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of the other, and to examine wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes on both ſides. Neither party was willing to admit the evidence, produced by the other, and mutual exceptions and proteſts were entered. The points in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate were, whether Merrimack river, at that time, emptied itſelf into the ſea, at the ſame place where it did ſixty years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore? Whether it bore the ſame name, from the ſea, up to the crotch? and wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er it were poſſible to draw a parallel line, three miles northward, of every part of a river; the courſe of which was, in ſame places, from north to ſouth?</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the boundary line, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween New-Hampſhire and Maine; the controverted points were, whether it ſhould run up the middle of the river, or on its north-eaſtern ſhore; and whether the line, from the head of the river, ſhould be due north-weſt, or only a few degrees weſtward of north.</p>
            <p>The grand point on which the whole controverſy reſpecting the ſouthern line turned, was, whether the charter of Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam

and Mary granted to Maſſachuſetts, all the lands which were granted, by the charter of Charles the firſt? On this queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Commiſſioners did not come to any concluſion. Reaſons of policy might have ſome weight, to render them indeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; but, whether it were really ſo or not, they made and pronounced their reſult in the following words.<note place="margin">Sept 2.</note>
               <q>In purſuance of his Majeſty's commiſſion,<note place="margin">MS Copy.</note> the Court took under conſideration, the evidences, pleas, and allegations offered and made by each party;<note place="margin">Journal of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, p. 35.</note> and upon mature adviſement on the whole, a doubt aroſe in point of law; and the Court thereupon came to the following reſolution. That if the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of King William and Queen Mary, grants to the Province of Maſſachuſetts Bay, all the lands granted by the charter of King Charles the firſt, lying to the northward of Merrimack river; then the Court adjudge and determine, that a line ſhall run, parallel with the ſaid river, at the diſtance of three Engliſh miles, north from the mouth of the ſaid river, beginning at the ſoutherly ſide of the Black Rocks, ſo called, at low wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter mark) and from thence to run to the crotch, where the rivers of Pemigewaſſet and Winipiſeogee meet; and from thence

But, if otherwiſe, then the Court adjudge and determine, that a line on the ſoutherly ſide of New-Hampſhire, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning at the diſtance of three miles north, from the ſoutherly ſide of the Black Rocks aforeſaid, at low water mark, and from thence running due weſt, up into the main land, toward the ſouth ſea, until it meets with his Majeſty's other governments, ſhall be the bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry line between the ſaid Provinces, on the ſide aforeſaid: Which point in doubt, the Court humbly ſubmit, to the wiſe conſideration of his moſt ſacred Majeſty, in his Privy Council; to be determined according to his royal will and pleaſure.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>As to the northern boundary, between the ſaid Provinces, the Court reſolve and determine; that the dividing line ſhall paſs up through the mouth of Piſcata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua harbour, and up the middle of the river of Newichwanock, (part of which is now called Salmon-Falls) and through the middle of the ſame, to the fartheſt
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:023166_0144_0FBC7F4A50980430"/>
head thereof, and from thence north, two degrees weſterly, until one hundred and twenty miles be finiſhed, from the mouth of Piſcataqua harbour aforeſaid; or until it meets with his Majeſty's other governments. And, that the dividing line ſhall part the Iſles of Shoals, and run through the middle of the harbour, between the iſlands, to the ſea, on the ſoutherly ſide; and that the ſouthweſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly part of ſaid iſlands ſhall lie in, and be accounted part of, the Province of New-Hampſhire; and that the north-eaſterly part thereof ſhall lie in, and be account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed part of, the Province of Maſſachuſetts Bay; and be held and enjoyed by the ſaid Provinces reſpectively, in the ſame man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as they now do, and have heretofore held and enjoyed the ſame.</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <q>And the Court do further adjudge, that the coſt and charge ariſing by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out the Commiſſion, and alſo of the Commiſſioners and their officers, viz. the two Clerks, Surveyor and Waiter, for their travelling expenſes, and attendance in the execution of the ſame, be equally borne by the ſaid Provinces.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Thus this long depending queſtion, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all the time, expenſe and argument, which it had occaſioned, remained unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided.</p>

               <pb n="146" facs="unknown:023166_0145_0FBC7F4B46A48408"/>When this evaſive decree was publiſhed, the Commiſſioners adjourned, to the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of October, to receive appeals; and the ſame day, the Governor, at the requeſt of the Council only, adjourned the Aſſembly of New-Hampſhire to the twelfth of October. By this ſudden ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment, it was impoſſible for them to obtain a copy of the decree, before their diſperſion, or to frame an appeal, till two days before the time, when it muſt have been preſented. The Aſſembly of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts continued their ſeſſion, at Saliſbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, five days longer. On the fifth of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember, they obtained copies of the royal Commiſſion, and the decree of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners, which they entered on their journal. On the ſixth, they agreed upon an appeal; and on the ſeventh, at the unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed requeſt of both Houſes, the Governor adjourned them to the 12th of October.</p>
            <p>The ſudden adjournment of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of New-Hampſhire, when that of Maſſachuſetts continued their ſeſſion, was unfortunate for Governor Belcher; and gave his opponents another advantage, to purſue their grand deſign againſt him. The reaſons aſſigned for it were, that the report of the Commiſſioners being ſpecial,<note place="margin">Printed brief.</note> the whole matter would of courſe come
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:023166_0146_0FBC7F4CC1BF7E98"/>
before the King, without any appeal from either Province. For this reaſon, a major<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the Council were againſt an appeal. That as the committee, appointed in A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pril, had the ſame power to act in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, as in the ſeſſion of the Aſſembly; and, as the Council were againſt appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſo the appeal could not be made, by the whole Aſſembly, and therefore the Governor thought, that the beſt ſervice which he could do to the Province, was to adjourn the Aſſembly, and leave the whole buſineſs in the hands of the committee. With reſpect to the ſhort time, between the 12th and 14th of October, it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, that the claim of New-Hampſhire was contained in a few lines, and their exceptions to the judgment of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners might be prepared in a quarter of an hour.</p>
            <p>Both Aſſemblies met again, in the ſame places, at the appointed time.<note place="margin">Oct. 12.</note> The Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentatives of New-Hampſhire having, by the help of their committee, in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of the Aſſembly, obtained the papers, framed their exceptions and ſent a meſſage, to know if the Council were ſitting; but the Council, being determined againſt an appeal, had met and adjourned, without doing any buſineſs. The Houſe therefore
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:023166_0147_0FBC7F4E7A00D8B0"/>
was reduced to the neceſſity of deſiring the Commiſſioners to receive their appeal, without the concurrence of the Governor and Council. The appeal, from the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Maſſachuſetts, was preſented in due form, authenticated by the Speaker, Secretary and Governor. Their commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee entered a proteſt againſt the appeal of New-Hampſhire, becauſe it was not an act of the whole Legiſlature; nevertheleſs, the Commiſſioners received it, and entered it on their minutes. Having received theſe appeals, the Commiſſioners adjourned their Court to the firſt of Auguſt in the next year, but they never met again.</p>
            <p>The Aſſembly of Maſſachuſetts appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Edmund Quincy and Richard Partridge Agents,<note place="margin">Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal of Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly.</note> to join with Francis Wilks, their former agent, in the proſecution of their appeal before the King; and raiſed the ſum of two thouſand pounds ſterling, to defray the expenſe.</p>
            <p>When the Repreſentatives of New-Hampſhire propoſed the raiſing of money, to proſecute their appeal, the Council non-concurred the vote.<note place="margin">Printed brief.</note> Their reaſons were, that the appeal was not an act of the Council; that they had no voice in the appointment of the agent; and, that at the beginning of the affair, the Houſe had
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:023166_0148_0FBC7F51128FB198"/>
declared to the Council, that the expenſe of it would be defrayed by <hi>private ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>At this ſeſſion of the Maſſachuſetts Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, Mr. Belcher put them in mind that he had ſuffered in his intereſt, by the continually ſinking value of their bills of credit, in which his ſalary was paid; a point which he had, often before,<note place="margin">Hutch. II, 390.</note> urged them to conſider. In anſwer to this meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, they made him a grant of £ 333, 6, 8,<note place="margin">Journal,</note> in bills of the new tenor. The ſame day,<note place="margin">Oct. 19.</note> they made a grant of the like ſum, to the Preſident of Harvard College. Both theſe ſums appear to have been juſtly due; and at any other time, no exception could have been made to either. But, becauſe the grant to the Governor happened to be made, at the ſame time with the grant of £ 2000 ſterling to the agents, his opponents pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that he received it as a bribe, from the Aſſembly of Maſſachuſetts, for favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their cauſe.</p>
            <p>The appeal of New-Hampſhire, from the judgment of the Commiſſioners,<note place="margin">MSS.</note> was founded on the following reaſons. With reſpect to the ſoutherly line; becauſe it made the Black Rocks, lying in a bay of Merrimack river, the point from which the three miles were to be meaſured; which
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:023166_0149_0FBC7F533ABB8D90"/>
point was three quarters of a mile north of the river's mouth; and, becauſe a line, parallel with the river, was not only im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable, but founded on the old char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which had been vacated; and, if prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable, yet ought not to go farther than the river held a weſterly courſe. With reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the northern boundary, they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected to that part of the judgment only, which directed the line to run up the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the river; alleging that the grant to Gorges was only of land, between that river and Kenebec; and that New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire had always been in poſſeſſion of the whole river, and had maintained a fortreſs which commanded its entrance.</p>
            <p>The appeal of Maſſachuſetts was ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the following reaſons. That by the charter of William and Mary, the old Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony of Maſſachuſetts was re-incorporated without any exception; that this charter empowered the Governor and General Aſſembly to grant all lands, comprehended in the old Colony; that the committee of New-Hampſhire acknowledged, that New-Hampſhire lay without the late Colony of Maſſachuſetts, by declaring that it was between that and the Province of Maine; that the weſt line, claimed by New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, would croſs Merrimack river, thirty
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:023166_0150_0FBC7F5436603638"/>
miles from its mouth, and exclude forty miles of ſaid river out of Maſſachuſetts, though declared, by both charters, to be in it. They objected to extending the line of New-Hampſhire till it ſhould meet with his Majeſty's other governments; becauſe according to <hi>Maſon's grant,</hi> New-Hampſhire could extend no farther than ſixty miles from the ſea. With reſpect to the northern boundary, they objected to a line north, two degrees weſtwardly, alleging that it ought to be on the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>weſt point; they alſo excepted to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traction of this line, till it ſhould meet with his Majeſty's other governments; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leging that it ought to extend no farther than one hundred and twenty miles, the fixed limits of the Province of Maine.</p>
            <p>It was unfortunate for Maſſachuſetts that their committee had brought Maſon's grant, in evidence to the Commiſſioners, and again recited it in their appeal; for a line of ſixty miles from the ſea would croſs Merrimack river, long before the ſimilar curve line, for which they contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, could be completed. Beſides, Maſon's grant extended to Naumkeag; which was much further ſouthward, than they would have been willing to admit.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="152" facs="unknown:023166_0151_0FBC7F55E7232658"/>It may ſeem curious and unaccounta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to moſt readers, that the Commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſhould determine the northern, or rath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er eaſtern bounds of the northern part of New-Hampſhire, to be a line drawn <hi>north, two degrees weſterly,</hi> from the head of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon-fall River; when the expreſs words of Gorges' patent are 'north weſtward.' The agents for Maſſachuſetts, when this claim was put in by New-Hampſhire,<note place="margin">Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon II, 389.</note> could hardly think it was ſeriouſly meant, when it was alleged that by northweſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward muſt be underſtood, north <hi>a little</hi> weſtward.<note place="margin">MS min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utes of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners.</note> The only oſtenſible reaſon, given for this conſtruction was, that if a northweſt line had been intended, then a ſoutheaſt line, drawn from the mouth of the harbour, would leave all the Iſles of Shoals in New-Hampſhire; whereas, the dividing line runs between them. On the other ſide, it might have been ſaid, with equal propriety, that a line drawn ſouth, two degrees eaſt, from the mouth of the harbour, would leave all theſe iſlands in Maſſachuſetts. For the point where the iſlands are divided bears ſouth, twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nine degrees eaſt,<note place="margin">Obſerved 1781.</note> from the middle of the harbour's mouth; the variation of the needle being ſix degrees weſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="153" facs="unknown:023166_0152_0FBC7F5849568890"/>When this affair was again agitated in England, the agents of Maſſachuſetts ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a certificate from the learned Dr. Halley, that a line northweſtward ought to run forty-five degrees weſtward of the north point. This was demonſtratively true; but there were political reaſons for diſſenting from mathematical demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. One of them is thus expreſſed, in a private letter, from a committee of the Aſſembly, to their agent Thomlinſon.
<q>We hope that the northern line will be but a few degrees, to the weſtward of north, that his Majeſty's Province may include the greateſt number, and beſt maſt trees for the royal navy.</q>
Though this thought might never have occurred to a mathematician, yet ſome of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners were doubtleſs acquainted with it; and it was too important, not to have been communicated to the King's miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. Another political reaſon of diſſent was, that by enlarging New-Hampſhire, there would be a better proſpect of obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a diſtinct Governor, which was the grand object in view.</p>
            <p>The new agent of Maſſachuſetts,<note place="margin">1738.</note> Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mund Quincy, died of the ſmall-pox, ſoon after his arrival in London. The affair was then left in the hands of Wilks
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:023166_0153_0FBC7F5AD4E837F8"/>
and Partridge, neither of whom under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood ſo much of the controverſy as Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſon; who was alſo far ſuperior to them in addreſs. In his letters, to his friends in New-Hampſhire, he frequently blames them for their negligence, in not ſending to him the neceſſary papers in proper ſeaſon; and when ſent, for the want of correctneſs and regularity in them. But their deficiency was abundantly compen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſated by the dexterity of his ſolicitor, Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris; who drew up a long
<q>petition of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal;</q>
in which, all the circumſtances, attending the whole tranſaction, from the beginning, were recited, and colored, in ſuch a manner, as to aſperſe the Governor and Aſſembly of
<q>the vaſt, opulent, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown Province of Maſſachuſetts;</q>
while
<q>the poor, little, loyal, diſtreſſed Province of New-Hampſhire</q>
was repreſented as ready to be devoured, and the King's own prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty and poſſeſſions ſwallowed up, by the boundleſs rapacity of the charter govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Concerning the manner in which this maſterly philippic was framed, and the principal object at which it was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, there can be no better evidence, than that which is contained in a letter, written by Parris to Thomlinſon, and by him ſent to New-Hampſhire.

            <p>THE ſpirit of intrigue was not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined to New-Hampſhire; for the politicians of Maſſachuſetts, by bringing into view the long dormant claim of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, had another game to play, beſides proving the ſmall extent of New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. They perceived that the line, whether ſettled according to their own demand or that of New-Hampſhire, would cut off a conſiderable part of ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of their townſhips; and though they had, by their agent, obtained a promiſe, that private property ſhould not be affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the line of juriſdiction, yet they thought it beſt to have ſome other ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity.</p>
            <p>For what reaſon the government of Maſſachuſetts did not purchaſe the Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince of New-Hampſhire, from Robert

This manoeuvre ſerved to ſtrengthen the intereſt of New-Hampſhire, and Thomlinſon was much applauded for his dexterity. He had the ſtrongeſt inducement, to continue his efforts in their favor; for no leſs than twelve hundred pounds ſterling had been already expended, in proſecuting the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair of the line; which ſum had been ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced by himſelf and Rindge. There was no proſpect of repayment, unleſs the Province could be put under a ſeparate Governor; and this point could not be obtained, till the removal of Belcher.</p>
            <p>The agents of Maſſachuſetts, after a long delay,<note place="margin">July 18.

which had been no part of the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ords of the Commiſſioners. Thomlin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon finding this new petition thrown in his way, applied for its being immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard; and at the hearing,<note place="margin">Nov. 30.</note> it was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed, but without prejudice to the agents of Maſſachuſetts being permitted, to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject againſt the regularity of the New-Hampſhire appeal, when it ſhould come to a hearing. Such were the complaints againſt the Governor, and the importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of his adverſaries to proſecute them, that it was neceſſary to hear and diſpatch them, before the appeal reſpecting the lines could be brought forward.</p>
            <p>It muſt be remembered, that Mr. Belch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er had enemies, in his government of Maſſachuſetts as well as New-Hampſhire, who united their efforts to obtain his removal from both; but, as they ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him more vulnerable in his capacity of Governor of New-Hampſhire, ſo they joined in ſtrengthning the complaints, from that quarter, as a preparatory ſtep, to effect his complete removal. Whilſt he was engaged, in preparing for his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, againſt the charges, in the petition of appeal; other attacks were meditating, which were conducted with ſuch <hi>ſilence</hi> that it was impoſſible for him to guard

againſt their effects.<note place="margin">1739.</note> One of theſe was a letter, purporting to have been written at Exeter,<note place="margin">May 5.</note> ſubſcribed by five perſons, ſaid to be inhabitants of that town, and directed to Sir Charles Wager, firſt Lord of the Admiralty. In this letter it was ſaid, that
<q>finding his Lordſhip had ordered the Judge Advocate of the Court of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty to inquire into the riot,<note place="margin">MS copy of Exeter letter.</note> which had been committed there, (1734) and the aſſault of the ſurveyor and his officers; and fearing to be brought into trouble on that account, they would confeſs the whole truth. That they had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, by former ſurveyors, in cutting all ſorts of pine trees, till the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Col. Dunbar to that office; who had reſtrained and proſecuted them; but that Governor Belcher had privately given them encouragement, to go on; by aſſuring them that they had the beſt right to the trees; that the laws were iniquitous, and ought not to be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; that although he muſt make a ſhew of aſſiſting that Iriſh dog of a ſurveyor; yet he would ſo manage it with the Council and Juſtices, who were under his influence, that they ſhould not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer; and further to encourage them, he had made ſeveral of them juſtices of
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:023166_0164_0FBC7F6DB5F70488"/>
the peace, and officers of militia. That he had alſo told them not to fear any in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into their conduct; for that he would write to the Board of Admiralty, in their favor; and boaſted, that he had ſuch an influence over their Lordſhips, that they would believe every thing which he ſhould ſay. That as they had now confeſſed the truth, they hoped to be forgiven, and not proſecuted in the Admiralty Court; and begged that this information might be kept ſecret till the Governor's removal, which they hoped would ſoon be effected. That whatever might have been ſaid to the contrary, they could aſſure him that the Province of New-Hampſhire contained the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt number of pine trees, and of the beſt quality, in all his Majeſty's American dominions; and, for further informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they referred his Lordſhip to ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral perſons then in London, particular<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Mr. Wentworth and Mr. Waldo; the latter of whom, was agent to Mr. Gulſton, for procuring maſts for the royal navy.</q>
            </p>
            <p>On the receipt of this letter, Sir Charles, with the candor of a gentleman, ſent a copy of it to Mr. Belcher; who immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ordered an inquiry; and it was
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:023166_0165_0FBC7F6F331C7900"/>
proved to be an entire forgery; four of the perſons whoſe names were ſubſcribed utterly diſclaimed it, and the fifth was not to be found; no ſuch perſon being known in the town of Exeter. The evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of this forgery was tranſmitted to England, with all poſſible expedition; but not till it had made an impreſſion, to the diſadvantage of the Governor.</p>
            <p>Another artifice uſed againſt him, was a memorial of Gulſton, the navy agent, and others; complaining of the defence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſtate of the Province; that the fort lay in ruins, and that the militia were without diſcipline; notwithſtanding the probability of a war. This memorial was ſo artfully drawn, as to throw the blame of the neglect on the Governor, without mentioning his name;<note place="margin">Belcher's letters MS.</note> which was intended, to prevent his obtaining a copy, and being allowed time to anſwer. Another complaint was made in the form of a letter, reſpecting the grant of the tract called Kingſwood; in which he was repreſented, as partial to his friends, in giving them an excluſive right, to the whole of that territory, which they deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the unappropriated lands of the Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince. Several parts of his adminiſtration were alſo complained of; and in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:023166_0166_0FBC7F71E9A2AD18"/>
the infrequency of his viſits to New-Hampſhire. This letter was ſigned by ſix members of the Council, and a majority of the Repreſentatives.</p>
            <p>Gulſton's memorial was preſented to the Lords of Council; and by them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the Board of Trade, accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the letter; and though Mr. Belch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's brother and ſon applied for copies, and time to anſwer, the requeſt was evad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and a report was framed, in favor of putting New-Hampſhire under a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Governor. When this report came before the Privy Council, Lord Wilming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, the Preſident, ordered it back again; that the Governor might have that juſtice which his agents had aſked. By this means, he had opportunity to anſwer in his defence; that without money, the fort could not be repaired; that it was not in his power to tax the people; that he had frequently applied to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies for money, to repair the fort; to which they had conſtantly anſwered, that the people were too poor to be taxed; and had ſolicited him to break through his inſtructions, and allow them to iſſue pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per money, without any fund for its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; that the militia had always been trained according to law; and that
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:023166_0167_0FBC7F73B7FC0FD0"/>
he had conſtantly viſited New-Hampſhire, and held an Aſſembly, twice in the year, unleſs prevented by ſickneſs; for which he appealed to the journals. To corrob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orate theſe pleas, the Governor's friends procured five petitions, in his favor, and praying for his continuance, ſigned by about five hundred people. The petitions, however, did not expreſs the ſenſe of the majority; who had been perſuaded into a belief, that they ſhould receive much ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>efit by a ſeparate Governor; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, a counter petition being circulated, was ſigned by about ſeven hundred of the inhabitants.</p>
            <p>Things being thus prepared, the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints were brought to a hearing,<note place="margin">Nov. 21.</note> before the Lords of Council;<note place="margin">Printed brief.</note> who reported to the King,
<q>that Governor Belcher had acted with great partiality, by prorogu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Aſſembly of New-Hampſhire, from the ſixth of July, 1737, to the fourth of Auguſt following; in diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his Majeſty's order in Council; which had been tranſmitted to him by the Lords of Trade, and which was proved to have been delivered to him, in due time; and, alſo by farther pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roguing the ſaid Aſſembly, from the ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond of September, 1737, to the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:023166_0168_0FBC7F75721169D0"/>
of October; whereby the Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince were deprived of the time, intended by his Majeſty's ſaid order, to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, to prepare a proper and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar appeal; thereby endeavoring to fruſtrate the intention of his Majeſty's commiſſion.<note place="margin">Dec. 27.</note>
               </q>
This report was approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the King; and from this time, it may be concluded, that Mr. Belcher's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval from the Government of New-Hampſhire was ſeriouſly contemplated. The grant of Kingſwood was alſo an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nulled; and he was prohibited from mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any other grants of land, till the lines ſhould be determined.</p>
            <p>This cenſure being paſſed on the Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor,<note place="margin">1740.</note> and the complaints being at an end; the way was prepared for a hearing of the appeals, from both Provinces,<note place="margin">March 5.</note> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the lines. Which being had, the determination of this long controverſy was made on a plan entirely new. The ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial part of the decree of the Commiſſioners was ſet aſide, and no regard was had to their <hi>doubt,</hi> whether the new charter grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the lands comprehended in the old. It was ſaid, that when the firſt grant was made, the country was not explored. The courſe of the river, though unknown, was ſuppoſed to be from weſt to eaſt;
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:023166_0169_0FBC7F76B801D078"/>
therefore it was deemed equitable,<note place="margin">1739.</note> that as far as the river flowed in that courſe, the parallel line at three miles diſtance ſhould extend. But as on the one hand, if by purſuing the courſe of the river, up into the country, it had been found to have a ſouthern bend, it would have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equitable to have contracted the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts grant; ſo, on the other hand, when it appeared to have a northern bend, it was equally inequitable to enlarge it. Therefore it was determined;
<q>that the northern boundary of the Province of Maſſachuſetts be, a ſimilar curve line, purſuing the courſe of Merrimack river, at three miles diſtance,<note place="margin">Council Records.</note> on the north ſide thereof, beginning at the Atlantic Ocean, and ending at a point due north of Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tucket falls; and a ſtraight line drawn from thence due weſt, till it meets with his Majeſty's other governments.</q>
The other parts of the decree of the Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, reſpecting the northern line, and the payment of expenſes, were affirmed.</p>
            <p>This determination exceeded the utmoſt expectation of New-Hampſhire; as it gave them them a tract of country, four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen miles in breadth, and above fifty in length, more than they had ever claimed. It cut off from Maſſachuſetts, twenty eight
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:023166_0170_0FBC7F79B10EEDF0"/>
new townſhips,<note place="margin">1740.</note> between Merrimack and Connecticut rivers; beſides large tracts of vacant land, which lay intermixed; and diſtricts from ſix of their old towns, on the north ſide of the Merrimack; and if, as was then ſuppoſed, the due weſt line were to extend, to twenty miles eaſt of Hudſon's river, the reputed boundary of New-York; a vaſt tract of fertile country, on the weſtern ſide of Connecticut river, was annexed to New-Hampſhire; by which an ample ſcope was given, firſt for landed ſpeculation, and afterward for cultivation, and wealth.</p>
            <p>When this determination was known, the politicians of Maſſachuſetts were cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grined and enraged.<note place="margin">Belcher's letters.</note> They talked loudly of injuſtice; and ſome of the more zealous propoſed trying the merits of the cauſe, upon the words of the charter, before the Judges in Weſtminſter Hall; who, it was expected, would upon their oath and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor reverſe the judgment, and tell the King that he had miſtaken the meaning of the royal charter. This would indeed have been a bold ſtroke. But a more moderate and puſillanimous ſcheme was adopted; which was to ſend over a new agent, to petition the King, that he would re-annex to their government, the twenty

            <p>About the ſame time, Governor Belcher procured a petition,<note place="margin">Thomlin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's MS letters.</note> from his ſix friends, of the Council of New-Hampſhire, to the King; praying that the <hi>whole</hi> Province might be annexed to the government of Maſſachuſetts.

But that from the towns was kept in ſuſpenſe a long time; till Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſon was prepared, to anſwer all the pleas, which Hutchinſon could advance, and proved too hard an antagoniſt for him.

It was finally diſmiſſed,<note n="*" place="bottom">The ill ſucceſs of this agency was probably the reaſon, that Mr. Hutchinſon took no notice of it, in his Hiſtory of Maſſachuſetts.</note> becauſe it was thought,
<q>that it never could be for his Majeſty's ſervice,<note place="margin">Bow brief.</note> to annex any part of his Province of New-Hampſhire, as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of territory, to Maſſachuſetts; but rather, that it would be for the benefit of his ſubjects there, to be under a diſtinct government.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Though Belcher's removal was ſeriouſly feared, by his beſt friends; yet he had ſo much intereſt with ſome of the Lords in high office, that they could not be prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with to give him up. The war, which had commenced between Britain and Spain, afforded him an opportunity, to ſignalize his zeal for the King's ſervice; and he determined to prove himſelf, a faithful ſervant to the Crown, in every inſtance; in hope that a courſe of time and fidelity might efface the impreſſions, which had been made, to his diſadvantage.</p>
            <p>It being reſolved by the Britiſh Court, to undertake an expedition to the Iſland of Cuba; Governor Belcher, agreeably to the orders which he had received from the Duke of Newcaſtle, iſſued a proclamation,<note place="margin">April 29.</note> for the encouragement of men who would enliſt in the ſervice;
<q>that they ſhould be ſupplied with arms and clothing; be in

the King's pay; have a ſhare of the booty which ſhould be taken; and be ſent home, at the expiration of their time of ſervice; and that his Majeſty would order a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of blank commiſſions, to be filled up by the Governor, and given to the officers, who ſhould command the troops, to be raiſed in the Provinces.</q>
He afterwards preſſed this matter,<note place="margin">Auguſt 1.</note> cloſely, in his ſpeech to the Aſſembly; and urged them, to make proviſion, for one hundred men, and a tranſport, to convey them to Virginia; where all the Colony troops were to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvous; and thence to proceed, under the command of Col. Gooch, to the place of their deſtination. The Aſſembly voted, as much as they judged ſufficient for this purpoſe; and the Governor appointed a Captain, and gave him beating orders; but the commiſſions and arms not being ſent, according to the royal promiſe, no men could be inliſted in New-Hampſhire. The Governor received commiſſions and arms for four companies to be raiſed in Maſſachuſetts;<note place="margin">Belcher's letters.</note> where he could eaſily have inliſted ten, had he been furniſhed accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the engagement. To this failure, and not to any want of exertion, on his part, in either of his governments, may be aſcribed the paucity of troops raiſed
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:023166_0174_0FBC7F7FF97F7F68"/>
in them; and yet his enemies failed not of blaming him on this account. The Repreſentatives of New-Hampſhire took this occaſion to frame a vote, diſapprov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his adminiſtration;<note place="margin">Auguſt.</note> and upon this vote, their agent founded another battery,<note place="margin">Thomlin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> to attack his character.</p>
            <p>In conformity to the royal determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the boundaries,<note place="margin">1741.</note> orders were given to Belcher, to apply to both his govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to join in appointing Surveyors, to run out, and mark the lines; and that if either ſhould refuſe, the other ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed <hi>ex parte.</hi> The Aſſembly of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts delayed giving an anſwer in ſeaſon, which was conſtrued a denial. The Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of New-Hampſhire appointed three Surveyors, to execute the ſervice, who were commiſſioned by the Governor. They were directed to allow ten degrees, for the weſterly variation of the needle; and the work was performed in the months of February and March. George Mitchel ſurveyed and marked the ſimilar curve line, from the ocean, three miles north of Merrimack river, to a ſtation north of Patucket falls, in the townſhip of Dracut. Richard Hazen began at that ſtation and marked the weſt line, acroſs Connecticut river, to the ſuppoſed boundary line of

New-York. Walter Bryent began the line, from the head of Salmon-falls river, and marked it about thirty miles;<note place="margin">MS returns in the files.</note> but was prevented from proceeding farther, partly by the breaking up of the rivers, which rendered travelling impracticable; and partly by meeting a company of Indians who were hunting, and took his men who for a ſcouting party.

            </p>
            <p>The return of theſe lines to the Board of Trade was one of the laſt acts of Mr. Belcher's adminiſtration. His enemies in both governments were indefatigable in their endeavors to remove him; and by their inceſſant applications to the miniſtry; by taking every advantage of his miſtakes; by falſehood and miſrepreſentation; and finally, by the diabolical arts of forgery and perjury,<note place="margin">Douglaſs I.481. Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon II, 397.</note> they accompliſhed their views. He was ſucceeded in the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Maſſachuſetts, by WILLIAM SHIRLEY; and in New-Hampſhire, by BENNING WENTWORTH.</p>
            <p>At this diſtance of time, when all theſe parties are extinct, and every reader may
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:023166_0176_0FBC7F840D3512B0"/>
be ſuppoſed impartial; it may ſeem rather ſtrange, that Governor Belcher ſhould meet with ſuch treatment, from the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Court, in the reign of ſo mild and juſt a Prince, as George the ſecond. That Mr. Belcher was imprudent and unguard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in ſome inſtances, cannot be denied. He was indeed zealous to ſerve his friends, and hearken to their advice; but, by this means, he laid himſelf open, to the attacks of his enemies; to whom he paid no court, but openly treated them with contempt. His language to them was ſevere and reproachful, and he never ſpared to tell the world, what he thought of them.</p>
            <p>This provoked them; but they had the art to conceal their reſentment, and carry on their deſigns, in ſilence, till they were ripe for execution. He had by far too mean an opinion of their abilities, and the intereſt which they had at Court; and when he knew that they had the ear of the Lords of Trade, he affected to think them,
<q>not very mighty Lords, nor able to adminiſter life and death.</q>
He had a conſciouſneſs, of the general integrity of his own intentions; and appears to have been influenced, by motives of honor and juſtice; but he was not aware of the force
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:023166_0177_0FBC7F8569E08520"/>
of his own prejudices. It may admit of doubt, whether, conſidering the extreme delicacy of his ſituation, it were within the compaſs of human policy, to have conducted ſo as to give offence to neither of his Provinces, in the management of ſuch a controverſy; but it is certain, that his antagoniſts could not fairly fix but one real ſtigma, on his character; and that when impartially examined, can amount to no more than an imprudent ſtep, at a critical time, grounded on an undue re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of an affront; for to ſuppoſe that his <hi>intention</hi> was to fruſtrate the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, is inconſiſtent with the whole ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or of his public declarations, and private correſpondence. When his enemies met him on fair and open ground, he was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways prepared to anſwer; but it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to guard againſt their ſecret at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks. If the cauſe which they meant to ſerve was a good one, why did they employ the baſeſt means to effect it?</p>
            <p>The cruelty and hardſhip of his caſe may appear from the following conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations. He had been one of the principal merchants of New-England;<note place="margin">Belcher's letter to Dodding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. MS.</note> but, on his appointment, to the Chair of Government, quitted every other kind of buſineſs; that he might attend with punctuality and
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:023166_0178_0FBC7F8678DE74D8"/>
dignity to the duties of his ſtation. By the royal inſtructions, he was reſtrained from giving his aſſent, to any grant of money, to himſelf; unleſs it ſhould be a permanent ſalary. What he received from New-Hampſhire was fixed, and paid out of the exciſe; but the Aſſembly of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts could not be perſuaded, to ſettle any ſalary upon him. They made him a grant of three thouſand pounds, (worth about ſeven or eight hundred ſterling) ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally once in a year, at their ſeſſion in May. He was then obliged to ſolicit leave from the King, to accept the grant, and ſign the bill; and ſometimes could not obtain this leave till the end of the year; once not till five days before the diſſolution of the Aſſembly. In the mean time he was obliged to ſubſiſt on his own eſtate; and had he died within the year, the grant would have been wholly loſt, to his family. He was earneſt to obtain a general permiſſion to ſign theſe grants; but in that caſe the clerks of offices, in England, through whoſe hands the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion muſt have paſſed, would have loſt their fees. He was now in the ſixtieth year of his age; he had a family of chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and grand children, whoſe ſole de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence was on him; and he thought
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:023166_0179_0FBC7F881B3C59E0"/>
with reaſon, that if his courſe of faithful ſervice, and the unworthy arts of his ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies had been duly conſidered; the cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his ſuperiors would have been leſs ſevere, than
<q>to deprive him of his bread and honor.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Whilſt he entertained the worſt opinion poſſible of the characters of his enemies, he had a ſtrong confidence, in the juſtice of the government, before which he was accuſed. In one of his letters to his ſon, he ſays,
<q>I muſt expect no favor while Bladen is at the Board of Trade; but were the devil there, I ſhould expect juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, under the Britiſh Conſtitution, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborated by the Hanover ſucceſſion.</q>
The event proved, that his confidence was not ill founded. For, on being ſuperſeded, he repaired to Court; where, though his preſence was unwelcome to ſome, yet he had opportunity to bring the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing evidence of his integrity, and of the baſe deſigns of his enemies. He was ſo far reſtored to the royal favor, that he obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a promiſe, of the firſt vacant government in America, which would be worthy of his acceptance. This proved to be the Province of New-Jerſey; where he ſpent the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing years of his life; and where his memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry has been treated with deſerved reſpect.</p>

            </head>
            <p>BENNING WENTWORTH, Eſq. ſon of the deceaſed Lieutenant Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enor, was a merchant of good reputation in Portſmouth, and well beloved by the people. He had repreſented his native town in the Aſſembly for ſeveral years, where he diſtinguiſhed himſelf in the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to Belcher. He afterward obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſeat in Council; where, ſenſible of the popularity of his family, and feeling the pride of elevation, he continued the oppoſition, and joined in the meaſures which were purſued for obtaining a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct Governor, without any apprehenſion that himſelf would be the perſon; till a ſeries of incidents, at firſt view unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate, prepared the way for his advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the chair.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="182" facs="unknown:023166_0181_0FBC7F8CE5D91640"/>In the courſe of his mercantile dealings, he had entered into a contract with an agent of the Court of Spain, and ſupplied him with a large quantity of the beſt oak timber; to procure which, he borrowed money in London. When he delivered the timber at Cadiz, the agent with whom he had contracted, was out of place, and the new officer declined payment. In re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to America the ſhip foundered and he was ſaved with the crew in a boat. Theſe misfortunes deranged his affairs and reduced him to a ſtate of bankruptcy. Afterward he went again to Spain, hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the intereſt of Sir Benjamin Keene, the Britiſh Miniſter, to obtain his due, but his ſuit was ineffectual. About that time Thomlinſon, deſpairing of Dunbar's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement to the government of New-Hampſhire, turned his thoughts toward Wentworth;<note place="margin">Thomlin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. MS.</note> and having procured him a letter of licenſe from his creditors in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, invited him thither. Wentworth repreſented his caſe to the Britiſh Court, complained of the injuſtice of Spain, and petitioned for redreſs. Many Britiſh mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants, who had ſuffered by the inſolence of the Spaniards, were, at the ſame time, clamorous for reparation.<note place="margin">Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazine, for 1739.</note> The miniſtry were ſtudious to avoid a war. A negoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:023166_0182_0FBC7F8EAB5C72D8"/>
was begun, and the Court of Spain promiſed reſtitution; but failed in the performance. War was then determined on, and all negociation ended. Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his plea for juſtice, Wentworth made his ſuit for favor; and by the aid of Thomlinſon, who underſtood the ways of acceſs to the great, he obtained a promiſe from the Duke of Newcaſtle, that when New-Hampſhire ſhould be put under a diſtinct Governor, he ſhould have the commiſſion.<note place="margin">MS letters of Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſon and Atkinſon.</note> The expenſe of the ſolicita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and fees, amounting to three hundred pounds ſterling, was advanced by his friends in England, and repaid by his friends in New-Hampſhire.</p>
            <p>He was received in Portſmouth, after a long abſence,<note place="margin">1741.</note> with great marks of popular reſpect.<note place="margin">Dec. 12.</note> Among the compliments which were paid to him on that occaſion, one was, that he had been inſtrumental of

               </q>
In his firſt ſpeech to the Aſſembly he reflected on the conduct of his predeceſſor, not by name, but by implication; for not having taken early meaſures to raiſe men for the expedition againſt the Spaniſh Weſt-Indies; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timated his apprehenſion, that the good intention of the Province in raiſing money
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:023166_0183_0FBC80CF57A515D8"/>
for that purpoſe,<note place="margin">1742.</note> would be fruſtrated, ſince the men who were willing to enter into the ſervice had enliſted in the other Provinces. He alſo complimented them, on their good faith in regard to the ſeveral emiſſions of paper money; all of which were to be called in within the preſent year. He did not forget to recommend a fixed ſalary for himſelf, not ſubject to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation; nor the payment of expenſes which had ariſen on account of the bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary lines; he informed them of the King's indulgence, in giving him leave to conſent to a farther emiſſion of bills of credit, to enable them to diſcharge their obligations to the Crown; provided that no injury ſhould be done to the trade of the mother country. He alſo recommended to their attention the faithful ſervices of their a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, one of whom, Rindge, was dead, and the payment of the debt due to his heirs.</p>
            <p>The Aſſembly, in their anſwer, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged the wiſdom and juſtice of the King in determining the long controverſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and Maſſachuſetts; but as to payment of the expenſe, they reminded him that one half ought to be paid by Maſſachuſetts, and deſired him to uſe his influence for that purpoſe. With reſpect
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:023166_0184_0FBC80D075D88BC0"/>
to the failure of raiſing men for the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, they ſet him right by aſcribing it to the true cauſe; there being no commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions ſent to the Province for that ſervice. Concerning the ſalary, they ſaid, that as ſoon as they could know what number of inhabitants would be added to them by the ſettlement of the lines, and how the money could be raiſed, they ſhould make as ample proviſion for his honorable ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port as their circumſtances would admit. They acknowledged the fidelity and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry of their agents, and profeſſed a good will to reward them; but could not then promiſe adequate compenſation.</p>
            <p>The Aſſembly voted a ſalary of two hundred and fifty pounds,<note place="margin">MS acts.</note> proclamation money, to the Governor, funded as uſual on the exciſe; and having obtained the royal licenſe for emitting twenty-five thouſand pounds on loan for ten years, they granted the Governor two hundred and fifty pounds more, to be paid annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally out of the intereſt of the loan. When this fund failed, they made annual grants for his 'further and more ample ſupport,' and generally added ſomething for houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent. They preſented their agent Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſon one hundred pounds ſterling, for his faithful ſervices; but what they did for the heirs of Rindge does not appear.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="186" facs="unknown:023166_0185_0FBC80D1F39886D0"/>
               <note place="margin">1743.</note>After Mr. Wentworth was quietly ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the chair of government, an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity preſented to advance his intereſt ſtill farther. For the ſum of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds ſterling, Dunbar was prevail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on to reſign the ſurveyorſhip of the woods, and Thomlinſon negociated an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in favor of Wentworth, with a ſalary of eight hundred pounds ſterling, out of which he was to maintain four Deputies. But to obtain this office, he was obliged to
<q>reſt his claim on the Crown of Spain for fifty-ſix thouſand dollars.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe appointments of Mr. Wentworth gave the oppoſers of the former admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration great cauſe of triumph; but the ſpirit of oppoſition had only changed ſides. It was hoped and expected by ſome, that Mr. Belcher, by going to England, would not only remove the ill impreſſions, which the malice of his enemies had made; but return to his former ſtation. Others, who had no predilection for Belcher, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with envy on the good fortune of Wentworth, and aimed to undermine him; at the ſame time courting the friends of the former adminiſtration to join in their meaſures. Theſe things were man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged with ſecrecy, and a few hints only
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:023166_0186_0FBC80D4B63A2FD8"/>
are left as evidence of the exiſtence of deſigns, which were never brought to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity.</p>
            <p>It was one of the royal inſtructions to Governors, that in any caſes of difficulty or ſudden emergency, they ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate with each other. Mr. Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth had a high opinion of the abilities of the new Governor of Maſſachuſetts, and there being a ſtrict friendſhip between them, conſulted him on all occaſions. Shirley was gratified by this deference, and knew how to make his advantage of it. Thus, though New-Hampſhire was under a Governor diſtinct from that of Maſſachuſetts, a point which had long been contended for; yet the difference was not ſo great in reality as in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.<note place="margin">MS <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>The war which had been kindled be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Britain and Spain,<note place="margin">1744.</note> extended its flame over a great part of Europe; and when France became involved in it, the American Colonies were more nearly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted, becauſe of the proximity of the French, and of the Indians, who were in their intereſt. War is ſo natural to ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages,
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:023166_0187_0FBC80D5B3CAA2F0"/>
that they need but little to excite them to it. An Indian war was a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry appendage of a war with France. The ſcene of both was opened in Nova-Scotia.</p>
            <p>That Province had been alternately claimed and poſſeſſed by the Engliſh and French for more than a century. Ever ſince the peace of Utrecht it had been ſubject to the Crown of Britain, and the French inhabitants who were under a kind of patriarchal government of their prieſts, and devoted to the French intereſt, were kept in awe, partly by the fear of having their dikes deſtroyed, which they had erected to prevent the ſea from over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing their fields;<note place="margin">MS of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The Indian tribes maintained their native independence, though they were attached to the French by religious, as well as intereſted obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Canſeau, an iſland on the northeaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern part of Nova-Scotia, was in poſſeſſion of the Engliſh. It was reſorted to by the fiſhermen of New-England. It was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſended by a block-houſe and garriſoned by a detachment of troops from Annapo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis. The iſland of Cape-Breton was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed by the French, and lay between the Engliſh of Canſeau and thoſe of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundland.

This was too near a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood for enemies, eſpecially when both were purſuing one object, the fiſhery.</p>
            <p>The French at Cape-Berton having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived early intelligence of the declaration of war;<note place="margin">March 15.</note> immediately reſolved on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the Engliſh fiſhery at Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau. Duqueſnel, the Governor,<note place="margin">May 13.</note> ſent Duvivier with a few ſmall armed veſſels, and about nine hundred men, who ſeized and took poſſeſſion of the iſland, burned the houſes, and made priſoners of the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon and inhabitants. This was done, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the news of war had arrived in New-England. It was followed by an attempt upon Placentia, in Newfoundland, which miſcarried. An attack was alſo made up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Annapolis, the garriſon of which was reinforced by ſeveral companies of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia and rangers from Maſſachuſetts, and the enemy were obliged to retire.

            <p>Theſe proceedings of the French were raſh and precipitate. They were not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for extenſive operations; nor had
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:023166_0189_0FBC80D9779A40C0"/>
they any orders from their Court to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them. What they had done, ſerved to irritate and alarm the neighbouring Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh Colonies, and ſhew them their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in the moſt conſpicuous manner. Their ſea coaſt, navigation and fiſhery lay expoſed to continual inſults. Their fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier ſettlements on the weſtern ſide were but eighty miles diſtant from the French fort on Lake Champlain. The Indians who lay between them, had not yet taken up the hatchet; but it was expected that encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement would be given them by the Governor of Canada, to inſult the fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiers. Several new ſettlements were whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly broken up; and many of the women and children of other frontier places retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the old towns for ſecurity.</p>
            <p>In the autumn, Duqueſnel the French Governor of Cape-Breton, died, and was ſucceeded in the command by Ducham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon,<note place="margin">Prince and Douglaſs.</note> who had not ſo good a military cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter. Duvivier went to France to ſolic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it a force to carry on the war in Nova-Scotia in the enſuing ſpring. The ſtore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, expected from France at Cape-Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, came on the coaſt ſo late in the fall; and the winter there ſet in ſo early and fierce, as to keep them out of port, and drive them off to the Weſt-Indies. The
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:023166_0190_0FBC80DAF87ED078"/>
captive garriſon of Canſeau, with other priſoners, who had been taken at ſea, and carried into Louiſburg, were ſent to Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. From them, as well as from other informants, Governor Shirley obtained ſuch intelligence of the ſtate of that iſland and fortreſs, as induced him to form the project of attacking it. But before we open this romantic and hazardous ſcene, it is neceſſary to give ſome account of the place which was to be the theatre of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erations.</p>
            <p>The Iſland of Cape-Breton, ſo denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated from one of its capes,<note place="margin">Charlevoix</note> lies between the forty-fifth and forty-ſeventh degrees of north latitude; at the diſtance of fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen leagues from Cape Ray, the ſouth-weſtern extremity of Newfoundland. It is ſeparated from the main land of Nova-Scotia by a narrow ſtrait, ſix leagues in length, the navigation of which is ſafe for a ſhip of forty guns. The greateſt length of the iſland, from north-eaſt to ſouth-weſt is about fifty leagues and its greateſt breadth thirty-three. It is about eighty-eight leagues in circuit as ſeamen eſtimate diſtances.<note place="margin">MS of S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Much has been ſaid by French and Engliſh writers on the great importance and advantage of this iſland, and ſome political and temporary purpoſes were doubtleſs to be anſwered by ſuch publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; but in fact the only real import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Cape-Breton was derived from its central ſituation, and the convenience of its ports. On the north and weſt ſides it is ſteep and inacceſſible; but the ſouth-eaſtern ſide is full of fine bays and har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, capable of receiving and ſecuring ſhips of any burden; and, being ſituated between Canada, France and the Weſt-Indies,
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:023166_0192_0FBC80DDF585B8A0"/>
it was extremely favorable to the French commerce. It was not ſo good a ſtation for the fiſhery as ſeveral parts of Nova-Scotia and Newfoundland. The greater part of the French fiſhery was proſecuted elſewhere;<note place="margin">Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> and they could buy fiſh at Canſeau, cheaper than they could cure it at Cape-Breton.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the French held poſſeſſion of the coaſts of Nova-Scotia and Newfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, this iſland was neglected; but after they had ceded theſe places to the Crown of England, and the Crown of England had ceded this iſland to them by the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Utrecht (1713) they began to ſee its value.<note place="margin">Charlevoix Douglaſs, R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lt, Prince.</note> Inſtead of giving ſo much atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the fur trade of Canada, as they had before done, they contemplated build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a fortified town on this iſland, as a ſecurity to their navigation and fiſhery. For this purpoſe they choſe a fine harbour on the ſouth-eaſt ſide of the iſland, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly called Engliſh harbour; where they erected their fortifications, and called the place Louiſbourg.</p>
            <p>The harbour of Louiſbourg lies in lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 45° 55′; its entrance is about four hundred yards wide. The anchorage is uniformly ſafe, and ſhips may run aſhore on a ſoft muddy bottom. The depth of
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:023166_0193_0FBC80DF71CC8900"/>
water at the entrance is from nine to twelve fathoms. The harbour lies open to the ſouth-eaſt. Upon a neck of land on the ſouth ſide of the harbour was built the town, two miles and a quarter in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumference; fortified in every acceſſible part with a rampart of ſtone, from thirty to thirty-ſix feet high, and a ditch eighty feet wide.<note place="margin">Abbe Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal.</note> A ſpace of about two hundred yards was left without a rampart, on the ſide next to the ſea; it was encloſed by a ſimple dike and a line of pickets. The ſea was ſo ſhallow in this place that it made only a narrow channel, inacceſſible from its numerous reefs to any ſhipping whatever. The ſide fire from the baſtions ſecured this ſpot from an attack. There were ſix baſtions and three batteries, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining embraſures for one hundred and forty-eight cannon, of which ſixty-five only were mounted, and ſixteen mortars. On an iſland at the entrance of the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour was planted a battery of thirty can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, carrying twenty-eight pounds ſhot; and at the bottom of the harbour, directly oppoſite to the entrance, was the grand or royal battery of twenty-eight cannon, forty-two pounders, and two eighteen pounders. On a high cliff, oppoſite to the iſland battery, ſtood a light-houſe;
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:023166_0194_0FBC80E0F044EB18"/>
and within this point, at the north-eaſt part of the harbour, was a careening wharf ſecure from all winds, and a magazine of naval ſtores.</p>
            <p>The town was regularly laid out in ſquares. The ſtreets were broad; the houſes moſtly of wood, but ſome of ſtone. On the weſt ſide, near the rampart, was a ſpacious citadel, and a large parade; on one ſide of which were the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's apartments. Under the rampart were caſemates to receive the women and children during a ſiege. The entrance of the town on the land ſide was at the weſt gate, over a draw bridge, near to which was a circular battery, mounting ſixteen guns of twenty-four pounds ſhot.</p>
            <p>Theſe works had been twenty-five years in building; and though not finiſhed, had coſt the Crown not leſs than thirty mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of livres. The place was ſo ſtrong as to be called 'the Dunkirk of America.' It was, in peace, a ſafe retreat for the ſhips of France bound homeward from the Eaſt and Weſt-Indies; and in war, a ſource of diſtreſs to the northern Engliſh Colonies; its ſituation being extremely favorable for privateers to ruin their fiſhery and inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt their coaſting and foreign trade; for which reaſons, the reduction of it was an
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:023166_0195_0FBC80E4F8857798"/>
object as deſirable to them, as that of Carthage was to the Romans.</p>
            <p>In the autumn, Shirley wrote to the Britiſh miniſtry,<note place="margin">Nov. 10.</note> 
               <note place="margin">Shirley's letters to Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth. MS.</note> repreſenting the danger of an attack on Nova-Scotia, from the French, in the enſuing ſpring; and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſome naval aſſiſtance. Theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters he ſent by Capt. Ryal, an officer of the garriſon, which had been taken at Canſeau, who,
<q>from his particular know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Louiſbourg, and of the great conſequence of the acquiſition of Cape-Breton, and the preſervation of Nova-Scotia, he hoped would be of conſiderable ſervice to the northern Colonies, with the Lords of the admiralty.</q>
Thus early did Shirley conceive and communicate to Wentworth his great deſign; and the moſt prudent ſtep which he took in this whole affair was to ſolicit help from England. His petition, ſupported by that worthy officer,<note place="margin">MS copy of D. New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Jan. 3.</note> was ſo favorably received by the miniſtry, that as early as the beginning of January, orders were diſpatched to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore Warren, then in the Weſt-Indies, to proceed to the northward in the ſpring, and employ ſuch a force as might be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to protect the northern Colonies in their trade and fiſhery, and diſtreſs the enemy; and for this purpoſe to conſult
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:023166_0196_0FBC80E709FC2318"/>
with Governor Shirley. Orders of the ſame date were written to Shirley, incloſed to Warren, directing him to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt the King's ſhips with tranſports, men and proviſions. Theſe orders, though ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely favorable to the deſign, were to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally unknown in New-England, till the middle of April following, before which time the expedition was completely form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid, that a plan of this fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous enterpriſe,<note place="margin">Douglaſs, Bollan, Hutchin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</note> was firſt ſuggeſted by Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Vaughan, a ſon of Lieutenant Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor Vaughan of New-Hampſhire. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other perſons have claimed the like merit. How far each one's information or advice, contributed toward forming the deſign, cannot now be determined. Vaughan was largely concerned in the fiſhery on the eaſtern coaſt of Maſſachuſetts. He was a man of good underſtanding, but of a daring, enterpriſing and tenacious mind, and one who thought of no obſtacles to the accompliſhment of his views. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his temerity is ſtill remembered. He had equipped, at Portſmouth, a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of boats to carry on his fiſhery at Montinicus. On the day appointed for failing, in the month of March, though the wind was ſo boiſterous that experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:023166_0197_0FBC80E878415630"/>
mariners deemed it impoſſible for ſuch veſſels to carry ſail, he went on board one, and ordered the others to follow. One was loſt at the mouth of the river, the reſt arrived with much difficulty, but in a ſhort time, at the place of their deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Vaughan had not been at Louiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>burg; but had learned from fiſhermen and others, ſomething of the ſtrength and ſituation of the place; and nothing being in his view impracticable, which he had a mind to accompliſh, he conceived a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to take the city by ſurpriſe; and even propoſed going over the walls in the win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the drifts of ſnow. This idea of a ſurpriſal forcibly ſtruck the mind of Shir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and prevailed with him to haſten his preparations, before he could have any anſwer or orders from England.</p>
            <p>In the beginning of January he requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the members of the General Court,<note place="margin">1745.</note> that they would lay themſelves under an oath of ſecreſy, to receive a propoſal from him, of very great importance. This was the firſt requeſt of the kind which had ever been made to a legiſlative body in the Colonies. They readily took the oath, and he communicated to them the plan which he had formed of attacking Louiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourg. The ſecret was kept for ſome days;
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:023166_0198_0FBC80EA0BBC0F10"/>
till an honeſt member, who performed the family devotion at his lodgings, inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertently diſcovered it by praying for a bleſſing on the attempt. At the firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation, the propoſal was rejected; but by the addreſs of the Governor and the invincible perſeverance of Vaughan, a pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition from the merchants concerned in the fiſhery, was brought into Court, which revived the affair; and it was fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally carried in the affirmative by a major<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of <hi>one</hi> voice,<note place="margin">Jan. 26.</note> in the abſence of ſeveral members who were known to be againſt it. Circular letters were immediately diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched to all the Colonies, as far as Pennſylvania, requeſting their aſſiſtance, and an embargo on their ports.</p>
            <p>With one of theſe letters,<note place="margin">Feb. 1.</note> Vaughan rode expreſs to Portſmouth, where the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly was ſitting. Governor Wentworth immediately laid the matter before them, and propoſed a conference of the two Houſes to be held on the next day. The Houſe of Repreſentatives having caught the enthuſiaſm of Vaughan, were impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient of delay, and deſired that it might be held immediately. It was accordingly held, and the Committee reported in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of the expedition;<note place="margin">Feb 2.</note> 
               <note place="margin">Printed Journal of this ſeſſion.</note> eſtimated the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe at four thouſand pounds, and deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

the Governor to iſſue a proclamation for inliſting two hundred and fifty men, at twenty-five ſhillings per month, one month's pay to be advanced; they alſo recommended that military ſtores and tranſports ſhould be provided, and that ſuch preparations ſhould be made as that the whole might be ready by the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of March. All this was inſtantly agreed to, on condition that proper meth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods could be found to pay the charges. This could be done in no other way than by a new emiſſion of bills of credit, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the letter of royal inſtructions. But, by the help of Shirley, a way was found to ſurmount this difficulty; for on the ſame day, he wrote to Wentworth, informing him that he had, in anſwer to repeated ſolicitations,<note place="margin">Private MS letters of Shirley.</note> obtained a relaxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his inſtructions relative to bills of credit, ſo far, as to have leave to conſent to ſuch emiſſions as the exigencies of war might require; and adviſing him, that conſidering the occaſion, it was probable, his conſenting to an emiſſion would rather be approved than cenſured by his ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors.<note place="margin">Feb. 3.</note> The next day, he wrote again, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring him that he might ſafely do it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided that the ſum to be emitted, were ſolely appropriated to the ſervice of the
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:023166_0200_0FBC80EDB4E5AFE0"/>
expedition. He alſo ſent him a copy of the inſtruction, enjoining him to let no perſon know that he had ſent it. Shirley himſelf had conſented to an emiſſion of fifty thouſand pounds, to be drawn in by a tax in the years 1747 and 1748.</p>
            <p>The Houſe of Repreſentatives paſſed a vote for an emiſſion of ten thouſand pounds toward defraying the charge of the expedition and farther carrying on the war, and the ſupport of government;<note place="margin">Feb. 5.</note> to be drawn in by taxes in ten annual pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to begin in 1755. The Council objected and ſaid, that the grant ſhould be wholly appropriated to the expedition and the payments ſhould begin in 1751. The Houſe adhered to their vote. The Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enor interpoſed, and an altercation took place, which continued ſeveral days. The Governor adjourned the Aſſembly till he could again aſk Shirley's advice and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive his anſwer. At length the Houſe altered their vote, and appointed the year 1751 for drawing in the money; augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſum to thirteen thouſand pounds, and at the Governor's expreſs deſire, they publicly aſſured him that they
<q>could not find out any other way to carry on the expedition, or in any degree ſhorten the period for bringing in the money.</q>
This
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:023166_0201_0FBC80F1914802E0"/>
was done to ſerve as an apology for the Governor's conſenting to the bill, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding he had no liberty to recede from his inſtructions; and thus, the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter being compromiſed,<note place="margin">Feb. 13.</note> he gave his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
            <p>During this tedious interval, a report was ſpread, that the Houſe had refuſed to raiſe men and money for the expedition; and the author of the report was ſought out and called to account by the Houſe for his miſbehaviour. The next day they altered their terms of inliſtment, conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably to thoſe offered in Maſſachuſetts, and by the 17th of February,<note place="margin">Feb. 17.</note> two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty men were inliſted for the ſervice.</p>
            <p>The perſon appointed to command the expedition was WILLIAM PEPPERRELL, Eſq. of Kittery, Colonel of a regiment of militia; a merchant of unblemiſhed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and engaging manners, exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively known both in Maſſachuſetts and New-Hampſhire, and very popular. Theſe qualities were abſolutely neceſſary in the Commander of an army of volunteers, his own countrymen, who were to quit their domeſtic connexions and employments, and engage in a hazardous enterpriſe, which none of them, from the higheſt to
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:023166_0202_0FBC80F2FB269018"/>
the loweſt, knew how to conduct. Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſional ſkill and experience were entirely out of the queſtion; had theſe qualities been neceſſary, the expedition muſt have been laid aſide; for there was no perſon in New-England, in theſe reſpects quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied for the command. Fidelity, reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and popularity muſt ſupply the place of military talents; and Pepperrell was poſſeſſed of theſe.

the expedition, if your limbs would have permitted you to take the chief command.</q>
Wentworth was charmed with the idea, and forgetting his gout, made an offer of his perſonal ſervice; but not till after the Aſſembly had agreed to his terms and the money bill was paſſed. Shirley was then obliged to anſwer him thus.
<q>Upon com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating your offer to two or three gentlemen, in whoſe prudence and judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I moſt confide, I found them clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of opinion, that any alteration of the preſent command would be attended with great riſque, both with reſpect to the Aſſembly and the ſoldiers being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely diſguſted.</q>

Whitefield told him, that he did not think the ſcheme very promiſing;<note place="margin">White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, No. 572.</note> that the eyes of all would be on him; that if it ſhould not ſucceed, the widows and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phans of the ſlain would reproach him; and if it ſhould ſucceed, many would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard him with envy, and endeavor to eclipſe his glory; that he ought therefore to go with 'a ſingle eye,' and then he
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:023166_0204_0FBC80F5F5F10178"/>
would find his ſtrength proportioned to his neceſſity. Henry Sherburne, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary of New-Hampſhire, another of Whitefield's friends, preſſed him to favor the expedition and give a motto for the flag; to which, after ſome heſitation, he conſented. The motto was,
<q>Nil deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>randum Chriſto duce.</q>
This gave the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition the air of a cruſade, and many of his followers inliſted. One of them, a Chaplain, carried on his ſhoulder a hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, with which he intended to deſtroy the images in the French churches.</p>
            <p>There are certain latent ſparks in hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature, which, by a colliſion of cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, are ſometimes brought to light; and when once excited, their operations are not eaſily controled. In undertaking any thing hazardous, there is a neceſſity for extraordinary vigor of mind, and a degree of confidence and fortitude, which ſhall raiſe us above the dread of danger, and diſpoſe us to run a riſque which the cold maxims of prudence would forbid. The people of New-England have at various times ſhewn ſuch an enthuſiaſtic ardor, which has been excited by the example of their anceſtors and their own expoſed ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. It was never more apparent, and perhaps never more neceſſary, than on oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:023166_0205_0FBC80F773125B28"/>
of this expedition. Nor ought it to be forgotten, that ſeveral circumſtances, which did not depend on human foreſight, greatly favored this undertaking.</p>
            <p>The winters in this country are often ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere; but the winter in which this expedition was planned, and particularly the month of February, was very mild. The har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours and rivers were open, and the weath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er was in general ſo pleaſant, that every kind of labor could be done abroad. The fruitfulneſs of the preceding ſeaſon had made proviſions plenty. The Indians had not yet moleſted the frontiers; and though ſome of them had heard that an expedition againſt Cape Breton was in hand, and carried the news of it to Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, ſuch an attempt was ſo improbable, that the French gave no credit to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, and thoſe in Nova-Scotia did not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the leaſt intelligence of the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Douglaſs obſerves, that
<q>ſome guardian angel preſerved the troops from taking the ſmall pox,</q>
which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in Boſton about the time of their embarkation, and was actually imported in one of the ſhips which was taken into the ſervice. A concurrence of happy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents brought together every Britiſh ſhip of war from the ports of the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:023166_0206_0FBC80F985760688"/>
continent and iſlands, till they made a formidable naval force, conſiſting of four ſhips of the line and ſix frigates, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of an active, judicious and experienced officer. On the other hand, the garriſon of Louiſbourg was diſcontent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and mutinous; they were in want of proviſions and ſtores; they had no know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the deſign formed againſt them; their ſhores were ſo environed with ice, that no ſupplies could arrive early from France, and thoſe which came afterward, were intercepted and taken by our cruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. In ſhort,
<q>if any one circumſtance had taken a wrong turn on our ſide, and if any one circumſtance had not taken a wrong turn on the French ſide,<note place="margin">Douglaſs 1, 336.</note> the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition muſt have miſcarried.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In the undertaking and proſecuting of an enterpriſe ſo novel to the people of New-England, it is amuſing to ſee how many projects were invented; what a variety of advice was given from all quarters, and what romantic expectations were formed by adviſers and adventurers. Dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inliſtment, one of the officers was heard to ſay with great ſobriety, that he intended to carry with him three ſhirts, one of which ſhould be ruffled, becauſe he expected that the General would give
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:023166_0207_0FBC80FA7965CD48"/>
him the command of the city, when it ſhould be taken. An ingenious and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent clergyman, preſented to the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral a plan for the incampment of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, the opening of trenches and the plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of batteries before the city.<note place="margin">Private MS letters.</note> To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent danger to the troops from ſubterra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neous mines, he propoſed, that two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidential perſons, attended by a guard, ſhould, during the night, approach the walls; that one ſhould with a beetle ſtrike the ground, while the other ſhould lay his ear to it, and obſerve whether the ſound was hollow, and that a mark ſhould be ſet on all places ſuſpected. Another gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, of equal ingenuity, ſent the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral a model of a flying bridge, to be uſed in ſcaling the walls of Louiſbourg. It was ſo light, that twenty men could carry it on their ſhoulders to the wall, and raiſe it in one minute. The apparatus for raiſing it conſiſted of four blocks, and two hundred fathoms of rope. It was to be floored with boards, wide enough for eight men to march abreaſt; and to prevent danger from the enemy's fire, it might be covered with raw hides. This bridge, it was ſaid, might be erected againſt any part of the wall, even where no breach had
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:023166_0208_0FBC80FE67F37A60"/>
been made; and it was ſuppoſed that a thouſand men might paſs over it in four minutes.</p>
            <p>But the moſt extraordinary project of all, was Shirley's ſcheme for taking the city by ſurpriſe, in the firſt night after the arrival of the troops, and before any Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh naval force could poſſibly come to their aſſiſtance. It is thus delineated in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidential letter which he wrote to Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, when he urged him to ſend the New-Hampſhire troops to Boſton, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed thence with the fleet of tranſports.
<q>The ſucceſs of our ſcheme for ſurpriſing Louiſbourg will entirely depend on the execution of the firſt night,<note place="margin">March 2.</note> after the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival of our forces. For this purpoſe it is neceſſary, that the whole fleet ſhould make Chappeau-rouge point juſt at the ſhutting in of the day, when they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not eaſily be diſcovered, and from thence puſh into the bay, ſo as to have all the men landed before midnight; (the land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of whom, it is computed by Capt. Durell and Mr. Baſtide, will take up three hours at leaſt.) After which, the forming of the four ſeveral corps, to be employed in attempting to ſcale the walls of Louiſbourg, near the eaſt gate, front<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſea, and the weſt gate, fronting
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:023166_0209_0FBC80FFFB490C38"/>
the harbour; to cover the retreat of the two beforementioned parties in caſe of a repulſe; and, to attack the grand bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery; (which attack muſt be made at the ſame time with the two other at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks) will take up two hours more at leaſt. After theſe four bodies are form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, their march to their reſpective poſts from whence they are to make their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks and ſerve as a cover to the retreat, will take up another two hours; which, ſuppoſing the tranſports to arrive in Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peau-rouge bay at nine o'clock in the evening, and not before, as it will be neceſſary for them to do, in order to land and march under cover of the night, will bring them to four in the morning, being day break, before they begin the attack, which will be full late for them to begin. Your Excellency will from hence perceive how critical an affair, the time of the fleet's arrival in Chappeau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouge bay is, and how neceſſary it is to the ſucceſs of our principal ſcheme, that the fleet ſhould arrive there, in a body, at that preciſe hour.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is eaſy to perceive that this plan was contrived by a perſon totally unſkilled in the arts of navigation and of war. The coaſt of Cape-Breton was dangerous and
<pb n="211" facs="unknown:023166_0210_0FBC810145DB63C0"/>
inhoſpitable, the ſeaſon of the year rough and tempeſtuous, and the air a continual fog; yet, a fleet of an hundred veſſels, after ſailing nearly two hundred leagues (for by this plan they were not to ſtop) muſt make a certain point of land 'at a preciſe hour,' and enter an unknown bay, in an evening. The troops were to land in the dark, amidſt a violent ſurf, on a rocky ſhore; to march through a thicket and bog three miles, to the city, and ſome of them a mile beyond it to the royal bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery. Men who had never been in action, were to perform ſervices, which the moſt experienced veteran would think of with dread; to pull down pickets with grap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling irons, and ſcale the walls of a regular fortification, with ladders, which were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terward found to be too ſhort by ten feet; all in the ſpace of twelve hours from their firſt making the land, and nine hours from their debarkation. This part of the plan was prudently concealed from the troops.</p>
            <p>The forces which New-Hampſhire fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed for this expedition, were three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty men, including the crew of an armed ſloop which convoyed the tranſports and ſerved as a cruiſer. They were formed into a regiment, conſiſting
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:023166_0211_0FBC8102B6134EB8"/>
of eight companies, and were under the command of Col. Samuel Moore. The ſloop was commanded by Capt. John Fernald; her crew conſiſted of thirty men. The regiment, ſloop and tranſports, were, by Governor Wentworth's written in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to the General, put under his command. Beſides theſe, a body of one hundred and fifty men was inliſted in New-Hampſhire and aggregated to the regiment in the pay of Maſſachuſetts. Thus New-Hampſhire employed five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men; about one eighth part of the whole land force.<note n="*" place="bottom">In the introductory part of Dr. Ramſey's elegant hiſtory of the American Revolution (page 34) it is ſaid, that
<q>this enterpriſe was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken by the SOLE authority of the Legiſlature of Maſſachuſetts.</q>
This is not ſufficiently accurate. It originated in Maſſachuſetts; but the Colonies of New-Hampſhire, Rhode-Iſland and Connecticut, by their legiſlative authority, furniſhed troops and ſtores. New-York ſent a ſupply of artillery, and Pennſylvania of proviſions; but the troops from Rhode-Iſland, and the proviſions from Pennſylvania, did not arrive till after the ſurrender of the city.</note> In theſe men, there was ſuch an ardor for action,<note place="margin">Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, MS.</note> and ſuch a dread of delay, that it was impracticable to put them ſo far out of their courſe, as to join the fleet at Boſton. Shirley therefore al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered the plan, and appointed a rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous at Canſeau; where the forces of New-Hampſhire arrived,<note place="margin">March 31.</note> two days before the General and his other troops from Boſton.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="213" facs="unknown:023166_0212_0FBC81044D67A018"/>The inſtructions which Pepperell re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from Shirley, were conformed to the plan which he had communicated to Wentworth, but much more particular and circumſtantial. He was ordered to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to Canſeau, there to build a block-houſe and battery, and leave two compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in garriſon, and to depoſit the ſtores which might not immediately be wanted by the army.<note place="margin">Original inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in MS.</note> Thence he was to ſend a detachment to the village of St. Peters, on the iſland of Cape-Breton and deſtroy it; to <hi>prevent</hi> any intelligence which might be carried to Louiſbourg; for which pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe alſo, the armed veſſels were to cruiſe before the harbour. The whole fleet was to ſail from Canſeau, ſo as to arrive in Chappeau-rouge bay about nine o'clock in the evening. The troops were to land in four diviſions, and proceed to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault before morning. If the plan for the ſurpriſal ſhould fail, he had particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections where and how to land, march, encamp, attack and defend; to hold coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils and keep records; and to ſend intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence to Boſton by certain veſſels retain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the purpoſe, which veſſels were to ſtop at Caſtle William, and there receive the Governor's orders. Several other veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels were appointed to cruiſe between Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:023166_0213_0FBC8105C9AFACE0"/>
and the camp, to convey orders, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſtores, and <hi>catch fiſh</hi> for the army. To cloſe theſe inſtructions, after the moſt minute detail of duty, the General was finally
<q>left to act upon unforeſeen emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies according to his diſcretion;</q>
which, in the opinion of military gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, is accounted the moſt rational part of the whole. Such was the plan, for the reduction of a regularly conſtructed fortreſs, drawn by a lawyer, to be execut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a merchant, at the head of a body of huſbandmen and mechanics; animated indeed by ardent patriotiſm, but deſtitute of profeſſional ſkill and experience. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they had embarked,<note place="margin">Prince's thankſgiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſermon, page 25.</note> the hearts of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny began to fail. Some repented that they had voted for the expedition, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted it; and the moſt thoughtful were in the greateſt perplexity.</p>
            <p>The troops were detained at Canſeau, three weeks, waiting for the ice which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vironed the iſland of Cape-Breton, to be diſſolved. They were all this time with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in view of St. Peters,<note place="margin">Pepperell's letters to Shirley, MS.</note> but were not diſcov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered. Their proviſions became ſhort; but they were ſupplied by prizes taken by the cruiſers. Among others, the New-Hampſhire ſloop took a ſhip from Marti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nico, and retook one of the tranſports,
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:023166_0214_0FBC8107AB565470"/>
which ſhe had taken the day before. At length, to their great joy, Commodore Warrren, in the Superbe, of ſixty guns,<note place="margin">April 23.</note> with three other ſhips of forty guns each, arrived at Canſeau, and having held a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation with the General, proceeded to cruiſe before Louiſbourg. The General having ſent the New-Hampſhire ſloop, to cover a detachment which deſtroyed the village of St. Peters, and ſcattered the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, ſailed with the whole fleet; but inſtead of making Chappeau-rouge point in the evening,<note place="margin">April 29.</note> the wind falling ſhort, they made it at the dawn of the next morning; and their appearance in the bay, gave the firſt notice to the French, of a deſign formed againſt them.</p>
            <p>The intended ſurpriſal being thus hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily fruſtrated, the next thing after land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the troops was to inveſt the city. Vaughan, the adventurer from New-Hampſhire, had the rank and pay of a Lieutenant Colonel, but refuſed to have a regular command. He was appointed one of the Council of War, and was rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy for any ſervice which the General might think ſuited to his genius. He conducted the firſt column through the woods, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in ſight of the city, and ſaluted it with
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:023166_0215_0FBC8108AFBCFA50"/>
three cheers. He headed a detachment, conſiſting chiefly of the New-Hampſhire troops, and marched to the north-eaſt part of the harbour, in the night; where they burned the ware-houſes,<note place="margin">May 1.</note> containing the naval ſtores, and ſtaved a large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of wine and brandy. The ſmoke of this fire being driven by the wind into the grand battery, ſo terrified the French, that they abandoned it and retired to the city, after having ſpiked the guns and cut the halliards of the flag-ſtaff. The next morning as Vaughan was returning,<note place="margin">May 2.</note> with thirteen men only, he crept up the hill which overlooked the battery, and obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the chimnies of the barrack were without ſmoke, and the ſtaff without a flag. With a bottle of brandy, which he had in his pocket, (though he never drank ſpiritous liquors) he hired one of his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a Cape Cod Indian, to crawl in at an embraſure and open the gate. He then wrote to the General,<note place="margin">Original MS.</note> theſe words,
<q>May it pleaſe your honor, to be informed, that by the grace of God, and the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of thirteen men, I entered the royal battery, about nine o'clock, and am wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for a reinforcement, and a flag.</q>
Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore either could arrive, one of the men climbed up the ſtaff, with a red coat in
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:023166_0216_0FBC810DE5FCCEC8"/>
his teeth, which he faſtened by a nail to the top. This piece of triumphant vanity alarmed the city, and immediately an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men were diſpatched in boats to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take the battery. But Vaughan, with his ſmall party, on the naked beach, and in the face of a ſmart fire from the city and the boats, kept them from landing, till the reinforcement arrived. In every duty of fatigue or ſanguine adventure, he was always ready; and the New-Hampſhire troops, animated by the ſame enthuſiaſtic ardor, partook of all the labors and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers of the ſiege. They were employed for fourteen nights ſucceſſively, in draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cannon from the landing place to the camp, through a moraſs; and their Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Colonel Meſſervè, being a ſhip carpenter, conſtructed ſledges, on which the cannon were drawn, when it was found that their wheels were buried in the mire. The men, with ſtraps over their ſhoulders, and ſinking to their knees in mud, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed labor beyond the power of oxen; which labor could be done only in the night or in a foggy day; the place being within plain view and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>andom ſhot of the enemy's walls. They were much diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed and chagrined, when they found that theſe meritorious ſervices were not
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:023166_0217_0FBC810EB18DA370"/>
more diſtinctly acknowledged in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts which were ſent to England, and afterwards publiſhed.<note place="margin">Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth's letters MS.</note>
            </p>
            <p>In the unfortunate attempt on the iſland battery by four hundred volunteers from different regiments,<note place="margin">May 26.</note> the New-Hampſhire troops were very active. When it was determined to erect a battery on the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>houſe cliff; two companies of them (Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon's and Fernald's) were employed in that laborious ſervice, under cover of their armed ſloop; and when a propoſal was made for a general aſſault by ſea and land, Colonel Moore, who had been an experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced ſea commander, offered to go on board the Vigilant, with his whole regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and lead the attack, if in caſe of ſucceſs he might be confirmed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the ſhip; but when this was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied, moſt of the men who were fit for duty, readily went on board the Princeſs Mary, to act as marines on that occaſion.</p>
            <p>It has been ſaid, that
<q>this ſiege was carried on in a tumultuary,<note place="margin">Douglaſs I, 352.</note> random man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, reſembling a Cambridge commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
The remark is in a great meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure true. Though the buſineſs of the Council of War was conducted with all the formality of a legiſlative aſſembly; though orders were iſſued by the General, and returns made by the officers at the
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:023166_0218_0FBC811037906168"/>
ſeveral poſts; yet the want of diſcipline was too viſible in the camp. Thoſe who were on the ſpot, have frequently in my hearing, laughed at the recital of their own irregularities, and expreſſed their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miration when they reflected on the almoſt miraculous preſervation of the army from deſtruction. They indeed preſented a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable front to the enemy; but the rear was a ſcene of confuſion and frolic. While ſome were on duty at the trenches, others were racing, wreſtling, pitching quoits, firing at marks or at birds, or run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after ſhot from the enemy's guns, for which they received a bounty, and the ſhot were ſent back to the city. The ground was ſo uneven and the people ſo ſcattered, that the French could form no eſtimate of their numbers; nor could they learn it from the priſoners, taken at the iſland battery, who on their examination, as if by previous agreement, repreſented the number to be vaſtly greater than it was. The garriſon of Louiſbourg had been ſo mutinous before the ſiege, that the officers could not truſt the men to make a ſortie, leſt they ſhould deſert; had they been united and acted with vigor, the camp might have been ſurpriſed and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the people deſtroyed.</p>

               <pb n="220" facs="unknown:023166_0219_0FBC8111B46DB8F0"/>Much has been aſcribed, and much is juſtly due to the activity and vigilance of Commodore Warren, and the ſhips under his command; much is alſo due to the vig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and perſeverance of the land for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the ſucceſs was doubtleſs ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, under God, to the joint efforts of both. Something of policy, as well as bravery, is generally neceſſary in ſuch undertakings; and there was one piece of management, which, though not mentioned by any hiſtorian, yet greatly contributed to the ſurrender of the city.</p>
            <p>The capture of the Vigilant, a French ſixty-four gun ſhip, commanded by the Marquis de la Maiſon forte, and richly lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en with military ſtores for the relief of the garriſon,<note place="margin">May 19.</note> was one of the moſt cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ital exploits performed by the navy. This ſhip had been anxiouſly expected by the French; and it was thought that the news of her capture, if properly communicated to them, might produce a good effect; but how to do it was the queſtion.<note place="margin">June. 1.</note> At length,<note place="margin">MS letters of Warren and Pep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perell.</note> the Commodore hit on this expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, which he propoſed to the General, who approved, and put it into execution. In a ſkirmiſh on the iſland, with a party of French and Indians, ſome Engliſh priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners had been taken by them, and uſed
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:023166_0220_0FBC81133B0B7E68"/>
with cruelty. This circumſtance was made known to the Marquis, and he was requeſted to go on board of all the ſhips in the bay where French priſoners were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined, and obſerve the condition in which they were kept. He did ſo, and was well ſatisfied with their fare and accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. He was then deſired to write to the Governor of the city, and inform him how well the French priſoners were treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and to requeſt the like favor for the Engliſh priſoners. The humane Marquis readily conſented,<note place="margin">June 7.</note> and the letter was ſent the next day by a flag, intruſted to the care of a Capt. Macdonald. He was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before the Governor and his chief of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers; and by pretending not to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand their language, he had the advantage of liſtening to their diſcourſe; by which he found, that they had not before heard of the capture of the Vigilant, and that the news of it, under the hand of her late commander, threw them into a viſible perturbation. This event, with the erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a battery on the high cliff at the light houſe, under the direction of Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Colonel Gridley, by which the iſland battery was much annoyed, and the preparations which were evidently making for a general aſſault, determined Ducham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bon

The army ſuppoſed that they had a right to a ſhare of theſe prizes; but means were found to ſuppreſs or evade their claim; nor did any of the Colony cruiſers (except one) though they were retained in the ſervice, under the direction of the Commodore, reap any benefit from the captures.</p>

            <head>CHAP. XX. Projected Expedition to Canada. Alarm by the French fleet. State of the Frontiers. Peace.</head>
            <p>WHILST the expedition to Cape-Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton was in hand, the active mind of Governor Shirley contemplated nothing leſs than the conqueſt of all the French dominions in America; and he conſulted with Governor Wentworth and Mr. At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kinſon on the practicability of ſuch a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. After Louiſbourg was taken, he made a viſit thither, and held a conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with Sir Peter Warren and Sir Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am Pepperell;<note place="margin">Shirley's MS letters.</note> and from that place wrote preſſingly to the Britiſh miniſtry on the ſubject. His ſolicitation, enforced by the brilliant ſucceſs at Louiſbourg, and the apparent danger in which Nova-Scotia and the new conqueſt were involved, had ſuch an effect, that in the ſpring of the following year,<note place="margin">1746.</note> a circular letter was ſent from the Duke of Newcaſtle,<note place="margin">April 6.</note> Secretary of State, to all the Governors of the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Colonies, as far ſouthward as Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia; requiring them to raiſe as many men
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:023166_0225_0FBC811D6C05F948"/>
as they could ſpare, and form them into companies of one hundred; to be ready to unite,<note place="margin">Douglaſs I, 315.</note> and act according to the orders which they ſhould afterwards receive. The plan was, that a ſquadron of ſhips of war, and a body of land forces, ſhould be ſent from England againſt Canada; that the troops raiſed in New-England ſhould join the Britiſh fleet and army at Louiſbourg, and proceed up the river St. Lawrence; that thoſe of New-York and the other Provinces at the ſouthward, ſhould be collected at Albany, and march againſt Crown Point and Montreal. The man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agement of this expedition was committed to Sir John St. Clair, in conjunction with Sir Peter Warren and Governor Shirley. St. Clair did not come to America. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren and Shirley gave the orders, while Warren was here; and afterward Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore Knowles, who ſucceeded him, was joined with Shirley; but as Knowles was part of the time at Louiſbourg, moſt of the concern devolved on Shirley alone.</p>
            <p>Beſide the danger of loſing Nova-Sco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia and Cape-Breton, there were other rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for undertaking this expedition. The Indians, inſtigated by the Governor of Canada,<note place="margin">Shirley's ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

houſes and mills, killing and carrying away the inhabitants. Though ſcouts and garriſons were maintained by the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; yet to act altogether on the defen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, was thought to be not only an inef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, but a diſgraceful mode of carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the war; eſpecially after the ſucceſs which had attended the arms of the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſts in their attempt againſt Louiſbourg. The continuance of ſuch a mode of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, would neither diſpirit the enemy, nor ſecure the frontiers from their depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations.</p>
            <p>The deſign was pleaſing, and the Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies readily furniſhed their quotas of men. In New-Hampſhire, the ſame difficulty occurred as on occaſion of the Louiſbourg expedition. The Governor had no au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to conſent to the emiſſion of bills of credit,<note place="margin">Shirley's MS letters,</note> 
               <note place="margin">May 31.</note> but Shirley removed that obſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, by ſuggeſting to him, that as the miniſtry did not diſapprove what he had done before, ſo there was no reaſon to fear it now; and that the importance of the ſervice, and the neceſſity of the caſe, would juſtify his conduct. The demand at firſt, was for levy money and victualing. The arms and pay of the troops were to be furniſhed by the Crown; but it was afterward found neceſſary that the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:023166_0227_0FBC811FF742F130"/>
governments ſhould provide clothing, tranſports and ſtores, and depend on a reimburſement from the Britiſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p>The Aſſembly was immediately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vened, and voted an encouragement for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſting a thouſand men,<note place="margin">June.</note> or more, if they could be raiſed; with a bounty of thirty pounds currency, and a blanket, to each man, beſides keeping two armed veſſels in pay. Col. Atkinſon was appointed to the command of the troops.<note place="margin">Atkinſon's MS letters.</note> Eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men were inliſted and ready for em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkation by the beginning of July. Tranſports and proviſions were prepared, and the men waited, impatiently, all ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer for employment. Neither the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral nor any orders arrived from England; the fleet, which was ſaid to be deſtined for the expedition, ſailed ſeven times from Spithead, and as often returned. Two regiments, only, were ſent from Gibraltar, to Louiſbourg, to relieve the New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land men, who had garriſoned it ſince the conqueſt. It is much eaſier to write the hiſtory of an active campaign, than to trace the cauſes of inaction and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; and it is in vain to ſupply the place of facts by conjecture.<note n="*" place="bottom">

               <pb n="229" facs="unknown:023166_0228_0FBC812176693AD0"/>In this time of ſuſpenſe, Sir Peter War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, and Sir William Pepperell, having arrived at Boſton, from Louiſbourg, Shirley had an opportunity of conſulting them, and ſuch other gentlemen as he thought proper, on the affair of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada expedition. The ſeaſon was ſo far advanced,<note place="margin">Shirley's &amp; Warren's MS letters.</note> that a fleet could hardly be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from England;<note place="margin">Auguſt 25.</note> or if it ſhould ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive, it would be too late to attempt the navigation of the river St. Lawrence. But, as a ſufficient body of the troops might be aſſembled at Albany, it was judged pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to employ them in an attempt againſt the French fort at Crown Point. At the ſame time, Clinton, Governor of New-York, ſolicited and obtained the friendly aſſiſtance of the Six Nations of Indians, on the borders of his Province. It was thought, that if this attempt ſhould be made, the alliance with theſe Indians would be ſtrengthened and ſecured; and the frontiers would be relieved from the horrors of deſolation and captivity, to which they were continually expoſed. In purſuance of this plan, the forces of New-Hampſhire were ordered to hold them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in readineſs, to march to Albany;<note place="margin">MS letter of Secreta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Willard.</note> but,<note place="margin">Sept. 1.</note> it being diſcovered that the ſmall-pox
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:023166_0229_0FBC8123B0B740A0"/>
was there, the rendezvous was appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Saratoga and the adjacent villages.</p>
            <p>No ſooner was this plan reſolved on, and preparations made to carry it into ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution, than accounts were received of danger which threatened Annapolis, from a body of French and Indians at Minas,<note place="margin">Shirley's &amp; Warren's MS letters,</note> and the probable revolt of the Acadians. It was thought that Nova-Scotia would be loſt,<note place="margin">Sept. 12.</note> if ſome powerful ſuccour were not ſent thither. Orders were according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly iſſued, for the troops of Maſſachuſetts, Rhode-Iſland and New-Hampſhire, to embark for that place, and
<q>drive the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy out of Nova-Scotia.</q>
But, within a few days more, the whole country was alarmed,<note place="margin">Sept. 20.</note> and thrown into the utmoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation, by reports of the arrival of a large fleet and army from France, at Nova-Scotia, under the command of the Duke D'Anville. It was ſuppoſed that their object was to recover Louiſbourg; to take Annapolis; to break up the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments on the eaſtern coaſt of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts; and to diſtreſs, if not attempt the conqueſt of the whole country of New-England. On this occaſion, the troops deſtined for Canada found ſufficient em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment at home, and the militia was collected to join them; the old forts on
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:023166_0230_0FBC812CD3367CD0"/>
the ſea coaſt were repaired, and new ones were erected. A new battery, conſiſting of ſixteen guns, of thirty-two and twenty-four pounds ſhot, was added to fort Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam and Mary, at the entrance of Paſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aqua harbour; and another, of nine thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-two pounders, was placed at the point of Little Harbour. Theſe works were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be ſufficient to prevent a ſurpriſal. Military guards were appointed; and in this ſtate of fear and anxiety, the people were kept for ſix weeks, when ſome priſoners,<note place="margin">Oct. 25.</note> who had been releaſed by the French, brought the moſt affecting accounts of the diſtreſs and confuſion on board the fleet. It was expected, by the people in New-England, that an Engliſh fleet would have followed them to America. This expectation was grounded on ſome letters from England, which Shirley had received and which he forwarded by expreſs to Admiral Townſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>end, at Louiſbourg. The letters were intercepted by a French cruiſer, and carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Chebucto, where the fleet lay. They were opened in a Council of War, and cauſed a diviſion among the officers; which, added to the ſickly condition of the men, and the damage which the fleet had ſuſtained by ſtorms, and their loſs by ſhipwrecks, dejected their commander to
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:023166_0231_0FBC812E39DBD038"/>
that degree, that he put an end to his life by poiſon; and the ſecond in command fell on his ſword. Theſe melancholy events, diſconcerted their firſt plan. They then reſolved to make an attempt on An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>napolis; but when they had ſailed from Chebucto, they were overtaken by a vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent tempeſt, off Cape Sable; and thoſe ſhips which eſcaped deſtruction, returned ſingly to France. Never was the hand of divine Providence more viſible, than on this occaſion. Never was a diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more ſevere, on the ſide of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; nor a deliverance more complete, without human help, in favor of this country.</p>
            <p>Nova-Scotia was not yet out of danger. The French and Indians, who, during the ſtay of the fleet at Chebucto, had appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before Annapolis, but on their depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture retired, were ſtill in the peninſula; and it was thought neceſſary to diſlodge them. For this purpoſe Shirley ſent a body of the Maſſachuſetts forces, and preſſed the Governors of Rhode-Iſland and New-Hampſhire to ſend part of theirs. Thoſe from Rhode-Iſland, and one tranſport from Boſton,<note place="margin">Nov. 10.</note> were wreck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the paſſage. The armed veſſels of New-Hampſhire, with two hundred men,
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:023166_0232_0FBC812FB475A060"/>
went to Annapolis; but the commander of one of them, inſtead of landing his men, ſailed acroſs the bay of Funda, into St. John's river; where,<note place="margin">Dec. 13.</note> 
               <note place="margin">Shirley's MS letters, &amp; affidavits of the crew.</note> meeting with a French ſnow, and miſtaking her for one of the Rhode-Iſland tranſports, he impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently ſent his boat with eight men on board, who were made priſoners, and the ſnow eſcaped. The ſloop, inſtead of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to Annapolis, came back to Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth. Theſe misfortunes and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointments had very ſerious ill conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. The Maſſachuſetts forces,<note place="margin">1747.</note> who were at Nova-Scotia, being inferior in number to the French, and deceived by falſe intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, were ſurpriſed in the midſt of a ſnow ſtorm, at Minas; and after an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate reſiſtance,<note place="margin">Jan. 31.</note> were obliged to capitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. Their commander,<note place="margin">Boſton Evening Poſt.</note> Col. Arthur Noble, and about ſixty men, were killed, and fifty were wounded. The enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing provided with ſnow ſhoes, made forc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed marches; and ours being deſtitute of them were unable to eſcape.</p>
            <p>When the alarm occaſioned by the French fleet had ſubſided, Atkinſon's regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment marched into the country to cover the lower part of the frontiers, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camped near the ſhore of Winipiſeogee lake; where they paſſed the winter and
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:023166_0233_0FBC813147CD21A0"/>
built a ſlight fort. They were plentifully ſupplied with proviſions, and had but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle exerciſe or diſcipline.<note place="margin">Atkinſon's MS letters.</note> Courts martial were not inſtituted, nor offences puniſhed. The officers and men were tired of the ſervice; but were not permitted to enter on any other buſineſs, leſt orders ſhould arrive from England. Some were employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſcouting; ſome in hunting or fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſome deſerted.</p>
            <p>Shirley was ſo intent on attacking Crown Point that he even propoſed to march thither in the winter,<note place="margin">Shirley's MS letters.</note> and had the addreſs to draw the Aſſembly of Maſſachuſetts into an approbation of this project. He enlarged his plan, by propoſing that the New-Hampſhire troops ſhould at the ſame time go, by the way of Connecticut river, to the Indian village of St. Francis, at the diſtance of two hundred miles, and deſtroy it; while the troops from Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, Connecticut and New-York, ſhould go by the way of the Lakes to Crown Point. The Governor of New-York would have conſented to this wild projection, on account of the Indian allies, who were impatient for war; but it was happily fruſtrated,<note place="margin">MS copy of Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves.</note> by the prudence of the Connecticut Aſſembly;<note place="margin">Jan. 28.</note> who deemed the winter an improper ſeaſon for ſo great an
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:023166_0234_0FBC813304827EC8"/>
undertaking, and deferred their aſſiſtance till the enſuing ſpring. At the ſame time the ſmall pox prevailed in the ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments above Albany, through which the forces muſt have marched; and that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper was then an object of much greater dread, than the ſtorms of winter, or the face of an enemy.</p>
            <p>To finiſh what relates to the Canada forces, it can only be ſaid, that excepting ſome who were employed on the frontiers, they were kept in a ſtate of military indo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, till the autumn of the enſuing year;<note place="margin">October, 1747.</note> when by order from the Duke of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſtle they were diſbanded, and paid at the ſame rate as the King's troops. The Governors drew bills on the Britiſh trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury; which were negociated among the merchants at ſeven and eight hundred per cent. and the Parliament granted money,<note place="margin">Shirley's MS letters.</note> to reimburſe the charges of the equipment and ſubſiſtence of theſe forces.</p>
            <p>The ſtate of the frontiers now demands our attention.<note place="margin">1745.</note> By the extenſion of the boundaries of the Province, ſeveral ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which had been made by the people of Maſſachuſetts, and under the authority of grants from their General Court, had fallen within New-Hampſhire. In one of them ſtood Fort Dummer, on the weſt
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:023166_0235_0FBC81350856B460"/>
ſide of Connecticut river, and within the lately extended line of New-Hampſhire. This fort had been erected and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, at the expenſe of Maſſachuſetts; but when it was found to be within New-Hampſhire, the Governor was inſtructed by the Crown to recommend to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, the future maintenance of it. In the ſame Aſſembly, which had ſo zealouſly entered upon the expedition againſt Cape Breton, this matter was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced; but a conſiderable majority of the lower Houſe declined making any grant for this purpoſe,<note place="margin">Printed Journal,</note> 
               <note place="margin">May 3.</note> and adduced the following reaſons, viz. That the fort was fifty miles diſtant from any towns which had been ſettled by the government or people of New-Hampſhire; that the people had no right to the lands which, by the dividing line, had fallen within New-Hampſhire; notwithſtanding the plauſible arguments which had been uſed to induce them to bear the expenſe of the line; namely, that the land would be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to them or elſe would be ſold to pay that expenſe; that the charge of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that fort, at ſo great a diſtance, and to which there was no communication by roads, would exceed what had been the whole expenſe of government before the
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:023166_0236_0FBC81385C817C40"/>
line was eſtabliſhed; that the great load of debt contracted on that account, and the yearly ſupport of government, with the unavoidable expenſes of the war, were as much as the people could bear; that if they ſhould take upon them to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this fort, there was another much better and more convenient fort at a place called Number-four, beſides ſeveral other ſettlements, which they ſhould alſo be obliged to defend; and finally that there was no danger that theſe forts would want ſupport, ſince it was the intereſt of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts, by whom they were erected, to maintain them as a cover to their frontier.</p>
            <p>When theſe reaſons were given, the Governor diſſolved the Aſſembly and call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed another, to whom he recommended the ſame meaſure in the moſt preſſing terms; telling them,<note place="margin">June 7.</note>
               <q>that it was of the laſt conſequence to the preſent and fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proſperity of the government; that their refuſal would leſſen them in the eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem of the King and his miniſters, and ſtrip the children yet unborn of their natural right; and deprive their brethren who were then hazarding their lives be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the walls of Louiſbourg of their juſt expectations, which were to ſit down on that valuable part of the Province.</q>
But his eloquence had no effect. They
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:023166_0237_0FBC8139804C7E08"/>
thought it unjuſt to burden their Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuents with an expenſe which could yield them no profit, and afford them no pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection.</p>

The danger to which theſe diſtreſſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple were conſtantly expoſed, did not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to cultivate their lands to any advantage. They were frequently alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when at labor in their fields, and oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed either to repel an attack, or make a retreat. Their crops were often injured, and ſometimes deſtroyed, either by their cattle getting into the fields where the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy had broken the fences, or becauſe they were afraid to venture out, to collect and ſecure the harveſt. Their cattle and
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:023166_0239_0FBC813C7689BF08"/>
horſes were frequently killed by the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; who cut the fleſh from the bones, and took out the tongues, which they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for food, by drying in ſmoke. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they were afraid even to milk their cows; though they kept them in paſtures as near as poſſible to the forts.

Five men were at work in a field, having their arms at hand.

            <p>The proſpect of an expedition to Canada had induced many of the ſoldiers who were poſted on the frontiers to inliſt into the regiments, becauſe they preferred active ſervice to the dull routine of a garriſon.

Six men only were left in the fort at Number-four, who, in the following winter deſerted it; and it was wholly deſtitute for two months. In this time ſome gentlemen, who underſtood the true intereſt of the country, prevailed on the Aſſembly of Maſſachuſetts, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the protection of thoſe deſerted plac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; and to employ a ſufficiency of men, not only to garriſon them, but to range the woods and watch the motions of the enemy.</p>
            <p>In the latter end of March, Captain Phinehas Stevens,<note place="margin">1747.</note> who commanded a rang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing company of thirty men, came to Number-four; and finding the fort entire, determined to keep poſſeſſion of it. He had not been there many days, when he was attacked by a very large party of French and Indians,<note place="margin">April 4.</note> commanded by M. Debelinè. The dogs, by their barking, diſcovered that the enemy were near; which cauſed the gate to be kept ſhut,<note place="margin">Stevens's letter, in Boſton E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vening Poſt, April 27.</note> beyond the uſual time.

that they were diſcovered, aroſe from their concealment and fired at the fort on all ſides. The wind being high, they ſet fire to the fences and log-houſes, till the fort was ſurrounded by flames. Captain Stevens took the moſt prudent meaſures for his ſecurity; keeping every veſſel full of water and digging trenches under the walls in ſeveral places; ſo that a man might creep through, and extinguiſh any fire, which might catch on the outſide of the walls. The fire of the fences did not reach the fort; nor did the flaming arrows which they inceſſantly ſhot againſt it take effect. Having continued this mode of attack for two days, accompanied with hideous ſhouts and yells; they prepared a wheel carriage, loaded with dry faggots, to be puſhed before them, that they might ſet fire to the fort. Before they proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this operation, they demanded a ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation of arms till the ſun-riſing, which was granted. In the morning Debelinè came up with fifty men, and a flag of truce which he ſtuck in the ground. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded a parley, which was agreed to. A French officer, with a ſoldier and an Indian, then advanced; and propoſed that the garriſon ſhould bind up a quantity of proviſions with their blankets, and having
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:023166_0249_0FBC8150064BB1C0"/>
laid down their arms ſhould be conducted priſoners to Montreal. Another propoſal was, that the two commanders ſhould meet, and that an anſwer ſhould then be given. Stevens met the French com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander, who, without waiting for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, began to enforce his propoſal, by threatning to ſtorm the fort, and put every man to death, if they ſhould refuſe his terms, and kill one of his men. Stevens anſwered, that he could hearken to no terms till the laſt extremity; that he was intruſted with the defence of the fort, and was determined to maintain it, till he ſhould be convinced that the Frenchman could perform what he had threatned. He added, that it was poor encouragement to ſurrender, if they were all to be put to the ſword for killing one man, when it was probable they had already killed more. The Frenchman replied,
<q>Go and ſee if your men dare to fight any longer, and give me a quick anſwer.</q>
Stevens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned and aſked his men, whether they would fight or ſurrender. They unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly determined to fight. This was immediately made known to the enemy, who renewed their ſhouting and firing all that day and night. On the morning of the third day, they requeſted another ceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:023166_0250_0FBC8151710F95E8"/>
for two hours. Two Indians came with a flag, and propoſed, that if Stevens would ſell them proviſions they would withdraw. He anſwered, that to ſell them proviſions for money was contrary to the law of nations; but that he would pay them five buſhels of corn for every cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, for whom they would give a hoſtage, till the captive could be brought from Canada. After this anſwer, a few guns were fired, and the enemy were ſeen no more.</p>
            <p>In this furious attack from a ſtarving enemy, no lives were loſt in the fort, and two men only were wounded. No men could have behaved with more intrepidity in the midſt of ſuch threatning danger. An expreſs was immediately diſpatched to Boſton, and the news was there received with great joy. Commodore Sir Charles Knowles was ſo highly pleaſed with the conduct of Capt. Stevens, that he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented him with a valuable and elegant ſword, as a reward of his bravery. From this circumſtance, the townſhip, when it was incorporated, took the name of Charleſtown.</p>
            <p>Small parties of the enemy kept hover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſometimes diſcovered themſelves. Sergeant Phelps killed one, near the fort,

and eſcaped unhurt, though fired upon and purſued by two others.</p>
            <p>Other parties went farther down the country; and at Rocheſter, they ambuſhed a company who were at work in a field. The ambuſh was diſcovered by three lads,<note place="margin">June 7.</note> John and George Place,<note place="margin">Haven's MS. letter.</note> and Paul Jen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nens. The Indians fired upon them. John Place returned the fire and wounded an Indian.

            <p>On a Sabbath morning, at Rocheſter, the wife of Jonathan Hodgdon was taken by the Indians,<note place="margin">May 1.</note> as ſhe was going to milk her cows.<note place="margin">Haven's MS letter.</note> She called aloud to her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:023166_0253_0FBC81583B3B0278"/>
The Indians would have kept her quiet, but as ſhe perſiſted in calling, they killed her, apparently contrary to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions. Her huſband heard her cries, and came to her aſſiſtance, at the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of her death. His gun miſſed fire, and he eſcaped. The alarm, occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this action, prevented greater miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief.</p>
            <p>The next month, they killed three men belonging to Hinſdale's fort,<note place="margin">June 16.</note> Nathan French, Joſeph Richardſon and John Froſt. Seven were taken; one of whom, William Bickford, died of his wounds. Capt. Hobbs, and forty men, being on a ſcout near Weſt River,<note place="margin">June 26.</note> were ſurpriſed by a party of Indians, with whom they had a ſmart encounter, of three hours contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uance.

            <p>During this affecting ſcene of devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and captivity; there were no inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of deliberate murder nor torture exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed on thoſe who fell into the hands of the Indians; and even the old cuſtom of making them run the gantlet was in moſt caſes omitted. On the the contrary there is an univerſal teſtimony from the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives who ſurvived and returned, in favor of the humanity of their captors. When feeble, they aſſiſted them in travelling; and in caſes of diſtreſs from want of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, they ſhared with them an equal proportion. A ſingular inſtance of mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eration deſerves remembrance. An Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an had ſurpriſed a man at Aſhuelot; the man aſked for quarter, and it was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Whilſt the Indian was preparing to bind him, he ſeized the Indian's gun, and ſhot him in one arm. The Indian, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſecured him; but took no other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge than, with a kick, to ſay
<q>You dog, how could you treat me ſo?</q>
The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman from whom this information came, has frequently heard the ſtory both from the captive and the captor.<note place="margin">Olcott's MS letter.</note> The latter

            <p>There was a ſtriking difference between the manner in which this war was man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged, on the part of the Engliſh and on the part of the French. The latter kept out ſmall parties continually engaged in killing, ſcalping and taking priſoners; who were ſold in Canada and redeemed by their friends, at a great expenſe. By this mode of conduct, the French made their enemies pay the whole charge of their predatory excurſions, beſides reap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a handſome profit to themſelves. On the other hand, the Engliſh attended on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to the defence of the frontiers; and that in ſuch a manner, as to leave them for the moſt part inſecure. No parties were ſent to harraſs the ſettlements of the French. If the whole country of Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ada could not be ſubdued, nothing leſs could be attempted. Men were continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally kept in pay, and in expectation of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; but ſpent their time either in gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſons, or camps, or in guarding proviſions when ſent to the ſeveral forts. Though large rewards were promiſed for ſcalps and priſoners, ſcarcely any were obtained, unleſs by accident. A confuſion of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cils, and a multiplicity of directors, cauſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:023166_0256_0FBC815CB01DCB78"/>
frequent changes of meaſures,<note place="margin">1747.</note> and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays in the execution of them. The forts were ill ſupplied with ammunition, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, clothing and ſnow-ſhoes. When an alarm happened, it was neceſſary, either to bake bread, or dreſs meat, or caſt bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, before a purſuit could be made. The French gave commiſſions to none but thoſe who had diſtinguiſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves by ſome exploit. Among us, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons frequently obtained preferment, for themſelves or their friends, by making their court to Governors, and promoting favorite meaſures in town meetings, or General Aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>A community recovering from a war, like an individual recovering from ſickneſs, is ſometimes in danger of a relapſe. This war was not deciſive, and the cauſes which kindled it were not removed. One of its effects was, that it produced a claſs of men, who, having been for a time releaſed from laborious occupations, and devoted to the parade of military life, did not readily liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to the calls of induſtry. To ſuch men peace was burdenſome, and the more ſo, becauſe they had not the advantage of half pay. The interval between this and the ſucceeding war was not long. The peace took place in 1749, and in 1754 there was a call to reſume the ſword.</p>

            <p>WHILST the people were contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with an enemy abroad, an attempt was making at home, to revive the old claim of Maſon, which their fathers had withſtood, and which for many years had lain dormant, till recalled to view by the politicians of Maſſachuſetts, as already related. After Thomlinſon had engaged with Maſon, for the purchaſe of his title, nothing more was heard of it, till the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy reſpecting the lines was finiſhed, and Wentworth was eſtabliſhed in the ſeat of government, and in the office of Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyor of the Woods.<note place="margin">1744.</note> The agreement which Thomlinſon had made, was in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of the Repreſentatives of New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire; and the inſtrument was lodged in the hands of the Governor, who ſent it to the Houſe for their peruſal and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">Oct. 30.</note> It lay on their table a long time, without any formal notice.<note place="margin">Aſſembly Records.</note> Quickening

meſſages were ſent time after time; but the affairs of the war, and Maſon's ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence at ſea, and in the expedition to Louiſbourg, where he had a company, together with a diſinclination in the Houſe, which was of a different complexion from that in 1739, prevented any thing from being done.</p>
            <p>In the mean time Maſon ſuffered a fine and recovery,<note place="margin">1745.</note> by which the entail was docked, in the Courts of New-Hampſhire,<note place="margin">Feb. 22.</note> and he became entitled to the privilege of ſelling his intereſt. He alſo preſented a memorial to the Aſſembly, in which he told them that he would wait no longer;<note place="margin">1746.</note> and unleſs they would come to ſome reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, he ſhould take their ſilence as a refuſal. Intimations were given, that if they would not ratify the agreement, a ſale would be made to other perſons, who ſtood ready to purchaſe. At length the Houſe came to a reſolution,
<q>that they would comply with the agreement, and pay the price;<note place="margin">Jan. 29.</note> and that the waſte lands ſhould be <hi>granted by the General Aſſembly,</hi> to the inhabitants, as they ſhould think proper.</q>
A committee was appointed to treat with Maſon, about fulfilling his agreement, and to draw the proper inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of conveyance; but he had on the

ſame day, by deed of ſale, for the ſum of fifteen hundred pounds currency, convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his whole intereſt to twelve perſons,<note place="margin">Jan. 30.</note> in fifteen ſhares. When the Houſe ſent a meſſage to the Council to inform them of this reſolution, the Council objected to that clauſe of the reſolve,
<q>that the lands be granted by the General Aſſembly,</q>
as contrary to the royal commiſſion and inſtructions; but if the Houſe would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs the King, for leave to diſpoſe of the lands, they ſaid that they were content.</p>
            <p>Theſe tranſactions raiſed a great ferment among the people. Angry and menacing words were plentifully thrown out againſt the purchaſers; but they had prudently taken care to file in the Recorder's office a deed of quit claim to all the towns which had been ſettled and granted within the limits of their purchaſe.<note place="margin">Records of deeds.</note>

<q>excepting and reſerving our reſpective rights, titles, inheritance and poſſeſſions, which we heretofore had, in common or ſeveralty, as inhabitants or proprietors of houſes or lands, within any of the towns, precincts, diſtricts or villages aforeſaid.</q>
This precaution had not at firſt its effect. A committee of both Houſes was appointed to conſider the matter, and they reported, that

This report was accepted, concurred and conſented to, by every branch of the legiſlature.

The ſame day, this commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee met with the purchaſers, and conferred on the queſtion, whether they would ſell on the terms propoſed? At the confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, the purchaſers appeared to be divided, and agreed ſo far only, as to withdraw their deed from the Recorder's office. The committee reported that they could make no terms with the purchaſers;<note place="margin">Aug. 12.</note> 
               <note place="margin">Aug. 28.</note> in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence

            <p>Much blame was caſt on the purchaſers, for clandeſtinely taking a bargain out of the hands of the Aſſembly. They ſaid in their vindication,
<q>that they ſaw no proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of an effectual purchaſe by the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly,<note place="margin">Sept. 4.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">MS letter, in Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Office.</note> though thoſe of them who were members, voted for it, and did what they could to encourage it; that they would have gladly given Maſon as much money, for his private quit-claim to their ſeveral rights in the townſhips already granted and ſettled; that Maſon's claim had for many years hung over the Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince, and that on every turn they had been threatened with a proprietor; that Maſon's deed to a committee of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, in behalf of that Province, for a tract of land adjoining the boundary line, had been entered on the records, and a title under it ſet up, in oppoſition to grants made by the Governor and Council; that it was impoſſible to ſay where this evil would ſtop, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they thought it moſt prudent to prevent any farther effects of it, by tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up with his offer, eſpecially as they knew that he might have made a more advantageous bargain, with a gentleman
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:023166_0262_0FBC8167D191B228"/>
of fortune in the neighbouring Province; but that they were ſtill willing, to ſell their intereſt to the Aſſembly, for the coſt and charges; provided that the land be <hi>granted by the Governor and Council</hi>; and that the agreement be made within one month from the date of their letter.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Within that month, the alarm cauſed by the approach of D'Anville's fleet, put a ſtop to the negociation. After that danger was over, the affair was revived; but the grand difficulty ſubſiſted. The purchaſers would not ſell, but on condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that the lands ſhould be granted, by the Governor and Council. The Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly thought that they could have no ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that the land would be granted to the people; becauſe the Governor and Council might grant it to themſelves, or to their dependents, or to ſtrangers,<note place="margin">1747.</note> and the people who had paid for it might be excluded from the benefit which they had purchaſed.<note place="margin">Aug. 20.</note> A propoſal was afterward made, that the ſale ſhould be to feoffees in truſt for the people; and a form of a deed for this purpoſe was drawn. To this propoſal, the purchaſers raiſed ſeveral ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections; and as the Aſſembly had not voted any money to make the purchaſe, they declined ſigning the deed; and no
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:023166_0263_0FBC816AAC5A4B38"/>
farther efforts being made by the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, the purchaſe reſted in the hands of the proprietors. In 1749 they took a ſecond deed, comprehending all the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonian grants, from Naumkeag to Paſcata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qua;<note place="margin">Records of deeds.</note> whereas the former deed was confin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the lately eſtabliſhed boundaries of New-Hampſhire. This latter deed was not recorded till 1753.</p>
            <p>After they had taken their firſt deed, the Maſonians began to grant townſhips,<note place="margin">1748.</note> and continued granting them to petition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, often without fees, and always with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out quit-rents. They quieted the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etors of the towns, on the weſtern ſide of the Merrimack, which had been granted by Maſſachuſetts, before the eſtabliſhment of the line; ſo that they went on peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly with their ſettlements. The terms of their grants were, that the grantees ſhould, within a limited time, erect mills and meeting-houſes, clear out roads and ſettle miniſters. In every townſhip, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved one right for the firſt ſettled miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, another for a parſonage, and a third for a ſchool. They alſo reſerved fifteen rights for themſelves, and two for their attorneys; all of which were to be free from taxes, till ſold or occupied. By vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of theſe grants, many townſhips
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:023166_0264_0FBC816BB8700750"/>
were ſettled, and the intereſt of the people became ſo united with that of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors, that the prejudice againſt them gradually abated; and, at length, even ſome who had been the moſt violent op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers, acquieſced in the ſafety and poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of their meaſures, though they could not concede to the validity of their claim.</p>
            <p>The heirs of Allen, menaced them by advertiſements, and warned the people againſt accepting their grants. They de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on the recognition of Allen's pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe, in the Charter of Maſſachuſetts, as an argument in favor of its validity; and ſuppoſed, that becauſe the ableſt lawyers in the kingdom were conſulted, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in framing that charter, they muſt have had evidence of the juſtice of his pretenſions, before ſuch a reſervation could have been introduced into it. So ſtrong was the impreſſion, which this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument had made,<note place="margin">MS letters of Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſon.</note> on the minds of ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulators in England, that large ſums had been offered, to ſome of Allen's heirs, in that kingdom; and, Thomlinſon himſelf, the firſt mover of the purchaſe from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, in behalf of New-Hampſhire, had his doubts; and would have perſuaded the aſſociates to join in buying Allen's title al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo,
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:023166_0265_0FBC816D31B37320"/>
even at the price of two thouſand pounds ſterling, to prevent a more expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive litigation, the iſſue of which would be uncertain. But they, being veſted with the principal offices of government; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men of large property, which was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo increaſed by this purchaſe; and having ſatisfied themſelves, of the validity of their title, by the opinions of ſome principal lawyers, both here and in England, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented themſelves with the purchaſe which they had made; and by maintaining their poſſeſſion, extended the cultivation of the country within their limits.</p>
            <p>The words of the original grants to Maſon, deſcribe an extent of ſixty miles, from the ſea, on each ſide of the Province, and a line to <hi>croſs over</hi> from the end of one line of ſixty miles, to the end of the other. The Maſonian proprietors plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that this croſs line ſhould be a <hi>curve,</hi> becauſe, no other line would preſerve the diſtance of ſixty miles from the ſea, in every part of their weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern boundary. No perſon had any right to conteſt this point with them, but the King. It was not for the intereſt of his Governor and Council to object; becauſe ſeveral of them, and of their connections, were of the Maſonian propriety; and no
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:023166_0266_0FBC816F12EBB830"/>
objection was made by any other perſons, in behalf of the Crown. Surveyors were employed, at ſeveral times, to mark this curve line; but on running, firſt from the ſouthern, and then from the eaſtern boundary, to the river Pemigewaſſet, they could not make the lines meet. Contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies were thus engendered, between the grantees of Crown lands and thoſe of the Maſonians, which ſubſiſted for many years. In ſome caſes, the diſputes were compromiſed, and in others, left open for litigation; till, by the revolution, the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment fell into other hands.</p>
            <p>This was not the only controverſy, which, till that period, remained undeter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. When the extenſion of the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dary lines gave birth to a demand, for the maintenance of fort Dummer, the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor had the addreſs,<note place="margin">Printed Journal,</note> to call to that Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly,<note place="margin">Jan. 1744.</note> into which he introduced this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, ſix new members; who appeared as repreſentatives for ſix towns and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricts, ſome of which had been, by the ſouthern line, cut off from Maſſachuſetts. It was ſuppoſed that his deſign, in calling theſe members, was to facilitate the adop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of fort Dummer. Other towns, which ought to have had the ſame privilege ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to them, were neglected. When
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:023166_0267_0FBC81705FE7F030"/>
the new members appeared in the Houſe, the Secretary, by the Governor's order, adminiſtered to them the uſual oaths; af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which, they were aſked, in the name of the Houſe, by what authority they came thither? They anſwered, that they were choſen by virtue of a writ, in the King's name, delivered to their reſpective towns and diſtricts, by the Sheriff. The Houſe remonſtrated to the Governor, that theſe places had no right, by law, nor by cuſtom, to ſend perſons to repreſent them, and then debarred them from the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of voting, in the choice of a Speaker; two only diſſenting, out of nineteen. Several ſharp meſſages paſſed, between the Governor and the Houſe, on that occaſion; but the preſſing exigencies of the war, and the propoſed expedition to Cape-Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, obliged him, for that time, to give way, and ſuffer his new members to be excluded, till the King's pleaſure could be known.</p>
            <p>The Houſe vindicated their proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, by appealing to their records; from which it appeared, that all the additions, which had been made to the Houſe of Repreſentatives, were, in conſequence of their own votes, either iſſuing a precept themſelves, or requeſting the Governor to
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:023166_0268_0FBC817364782E80"/>
do it; from which they argued, that no town, or pariſh, ought to have any writ, for the choice of a Repreſentative, but by a vote of the Houſe, or by an act of the Aſſembly. On the other ſide, it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leged, that the right of ſending Repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atives was originally founded on the roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al commiſſion and inſtructions, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that the privilege might, by the ſame authority, be lawfully extended to the new towns, as the King, or his Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, by advice of Council, might think proper. The precedents on both ſides were undiſputed; but neither party would admit the concluſion drawn by the other. Had this difficulty been foreſeen, it might have been prevented when the triennial act was made in 1727. The defects of that law, began now to be ſeverely felt; but could not be remedied.</p>
            <p>The diſpute having thus ſubſided, was not revived during the war; but as ſoon as the peace was made, and be King had gone on a viſit to his German dominions,<note place="margin">Dougla<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

him to make out precepts to the towns and diſtricts, whoſe Repreſentatives had been before excluded; and that when they ſhould be choſen, the Governor ſhould ſupport their rights.</p>
            <p>Had this inſtruction extended to all the other towns in the Province, which had not been before repreſented, it might have been deemed equitable; but as it reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe only, which had been the ſubject of controverſy, it appeared to be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on partial information, and intended to ſtrengthen the prerogative of the Crown, without a due regard to the privileges of the people at large.</p>
            <p>The party in oppoſition to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor became more acrimonious than ever.<note place="margin">1749.</note> Richard Waldron,<note place="margin">Jan. 3.</note> the former Secretary, and the confidential friend of Belcher, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the new Aſſembly and was choſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en Speaker. The Governor negatived him; and ordered the Houſe to admit the new members, and chooſe another Speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. They denied his power of negativing their Speaker and of introducing new members. The ſtyle of his meſſages was peremptory and ſevere; their anſwers and remonſtrances were calm, but reſolute, and in ſome inſtances ſatyrical. Neither party would yield; no buſineſs was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acted;
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:023166_0270_0FBC81764653BC58"/>
though the Aſſembly met about once in a month, and was kept alive, by adjournments and prorogations, for three years. Had he diſſolved them, before the time for which they were choſen had ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, he knew, that in all probability, the ſame perſons would be re-elected.</p>
            <p>The effect of this controverſy was inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to the Governor, as well as to the people. The public bills of credit had depreciated ſince this adminiſtration began, in the ratio of thirty to fifty-ſix; and the value of the Governor's ſalary had declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſame proportion. The exciſe could neither be farmed nor collected; and that part of the Governor's ſalary, which was funded upon it, failed. The Treaſurer's accounts were unſettled. The ſoldiers, who had guarded the frontiers in the preceding war, were not paid; nor were their muſter-rolls adjuſted. The public records of deeds were ſhut up; for the Recorder's time having expired, and the appointment being by law veſted in the Aſſembly, no choice could be made. No authenticated papers could be obtained, though the agent was conſtantly ſoliciting for thoſe which related to the controverſy about Fort Dummer, at that time before the King and Council.</p>

<q>I am ſuppoſed by many people to be privy to all the Governor's tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions here, which is totally without foundation.

<pb n="273" facs="unknown:023166_0272_0FBC8179348C0AA8"/>
fort Dummer, and it was in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to take off a large diſtrict from the weſtern part of New-Hampſhire, and to annex it to Maſſachuſetts, to ſatisfy them for that expenſe. Beſides this, the paper money of the Colonies was under the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of Parliament; and the Province of Maſſachuſetts was riſing into favor for having aboliſhed that ſyſtem of iniquity. The ſame juſtice was expected of New-Hampſhire, ſince they had the ſame means in their power by the reimburſement granted to them by Parliament for the Cape-Breton and Canada expeditions. This money, amounting to about thirty thouſand pounds ſterling, clear of all fees and commiſſions, had lain long in the treaſury; and when it was paid to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, he would have placed it in the funds, where it might have yielded an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of three per cent; but having no directions from the Aſſembly, he locked it up in the bank. This was a clear loſs to them of nine hundred pounds per an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num. There were ſome who reflected on the agent, as if he had made an advantage to himſelf of this money. Had he done it, his own capital was ſufficient to have anſwered any of their demands; but it was alſo ſufficient to put him above the
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:023166_0273_0FBC817B39693C30"/>
neceſſity of employing their money, either in trade or ſpeculation.</p>
            <p>It had alſo been ſuggeſted, that Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſon, at the Governor's requeſt, had ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited and procured the inſtruction, which had occaſioned this unhappy ſtagnation of buſineſs. When this ſuggeſtion came to his knowledge,<note place="margin">MS letter of Thomlin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to H. Sherburne,</note> he exculpated himſelf from the charge, in a letter which he wrote to a leading member of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly;<note place="margin">Nov. 13, 1749.</note> and gave a full account of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as far as it had come to his knowledge. He ſaid, that the Governor himſelf had ſtated the facts in his letters to the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; concerning his calling of the new members, in 1745, and their excluſion from the Aſſembly, with the reaſons given for it; and had deſired to know the King's pleaſure, and to have directions how to act. That the miniſtry, without any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception or heſitation, had pronounced his conduct conformable to his duty. That nevertheleſs, the Board of Trade had ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emnly conſidered the matter, and conſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Council, and had ſummoned him, as agent of the Province, to attend their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liberation. Their reſult was, that as the Crown had an indiſputable right to incor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porate any town in England, and quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy it to ſend members to Parliament, ſo
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:023166_0274_0FBC817C31CC0430"/>
the ſame right and power had been legal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly given to all the Governors in America; by means of which, all the Aſſemblies in the King's governments had increaſed in number, as the Colonies had increaſed in ſettlements. That any other uſage in call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Repreſentatives was wrong; although it might have been indulged, when the Province was under the ſame Governor with Maſſachuſetts. This was all which paſſed before the additional inſtruction came out, which was ſent through the hands of the Agent. As it was founded on a queſtion concerning the rights and prerogatives of the Crown; he argued the abſurdity of ſuppoſing, either that it had been ſolicited, or that any attempt to have it withdrawn could be effectual. His ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice was, that they ſhould ſubmit to it; becauſe, that under it, they would enjoy the ſame rights and privileges with their fellow ſubjects in England, and in the other Colonies; aſſuring them, that the then reigning Prince had never diſcovered the leaſt inclination to infringe the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional rights of any of his ſubjects.</p>
            <p>This advice, however ſalutary, had not the intended effect. Inſtead of ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, the party in oppoſition to the Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor, framed a complaint againſt him,
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:023166_0275_0FBC817F81CA11A0"/>
and ſent it to London, to be preſented to the King. If they could have prevailed, their next meaſure would have been, to recommend a gentleman of Maſſachuſetts for his ſucceſſor. This manoeuvre came to the ears of Thomlinſon; but he was under no neceſſity to exert himſelf on this occaſion; for the perſon to whoſe care the addreſs was intruſted, conſidering the abſurdity of complaining to the King,<note place="margin">MS letters of Thom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linſon.</note> againſt his Governor, for acting agreeably to his inſtructions, was adviſed not to preſent it. This diſappointment vexed the oppoſition to ſuch a degree, that they would have gladly diſſolved the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and put themſelves under the juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction of Maſſachuſetts, had it been in their power. But, finding all their efforts ineffectual, either to have the inſtruction withdrawn, or the Governor removed, they conſoled themſelves with this thought, that it was
<q>better to have two privileges taken from them, than voluntarily to give up one.</q>

A liberal diſtribution of commiſſions, civil and military, was made, and an era of domeſtic reconciliation commenced.</p>
            <p>The controverſy reſpecting Fort Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and the fear of loſing a diſtrict in that neighbourhood, quickened the Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor to make grants of ſeveral townſhips in that quarter, on both ſides of Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut river; chiefly to thoſe perſons who claimed the ſame lands, under the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts title. The war being over, the old inhabitants returned to their planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and were ſtrengthened by additions to their number. It was in contempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to extend the ſettlements, farther up Connecticut river, to the rich meadows of Cohos. The plan was, to cut a road to that place; to lay out two townſhips, one
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:023166_0277_0FBC81823B6EA150"/>
on each ſide of the river, and oppoſite to each other; to erect ſtockades, with lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for two hundred men,<note place="margin">Atkinſon's MS letters.</note> in each town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, encloſing a ſpace of fifteen acres; in the center of which was to be a citadel, containing the public buildings and gran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aries, which were to be large enough to receive all the inhabitants, and their mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able effects, in caſe of neceſſity. As an inducement to people to remove to this new plantation; they were to have Courts of Judicature, and other civil privileges a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, and were to be under ſtrict military diſcipline. A large number of perſons engaged in this enterpriſe; and they were the rather ſtimulated to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it, becauſe it was feared, that the French, who had already begun to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach on the territory claimed by the Britiſh Crown, would take poſſeſſion of this valuable tract, if it ſhould be left unoccupied.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">MS letters of Col. Iſrael Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ams.</note>In purſuance of this plan, a party was ſent up in the ſpring of 1752, to view the meadows of Cohos, and lay out the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed townſhips. The Indians obſerved them, and ſuſpected their intentions. The land was theirs, and they knew its value. A party of the Aroſaguntacook, or St. Francis Tribe was deputed, to remonſtrate
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:023166_0278_0FBC8183B0028318"/>
againſt this proceeding. They came to the fort at Number-four, with a flag of truce; pretending that they had not heard of a treaty of peace, which had been made with the ſeveral Indian tribes. They complained to Captain Stevens, of the encroachment which was meditating on their land; and ſaid, that they could not allow the Engliſh to ſettle at Cohos, when they owned more land already than they could improve; and, that if this ſettlement were purſued, they ſhould think the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh had a mind for war, and would reſiſt them. This threatening being commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to the Governor of Maſſachuſetts, and by him to the Governor of New-Hampſhire, threw ſuch diſcouragement on the project that it was laid aſide.</p>
            <p>The Indians did not content themſelves with remonſtrating and threatning. Two of the ſame tribe named Sabatis and Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ti, came to Canterbury;<note place="margin">April.</note> 
               <note place="margin">MS depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</note> where they were entertained in a friendly manner for more than a month. At their departure, they forced away two negroes; one of whom eſcaped and returned; and the other was carried to Crown Point and ſold to a French officer. A party of ten or twelve of the ſame tribe, commanded by Captain Moſes, met with four young men who
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:023166_0279_0FBC818560C269E0"/>
were hunting on Baker's river. One of theſe was John Stark. When he found himſelf ſurpriſed and fallen into their hands,<note place="margin">May.

They carried him and his companion, Eaſtman, up Connecticut river, through ſeveral carrying places, and down the Lake Memphrimagog to the head quarters of their tribe. There they dreſſed him in their fineſt robes and adopted him as a ſon. This early captivity, from which he was redeemed, qualified him to be an expert partiſan, in the ſucceeding war; from which ſtation, he afterward roſe to the rank of Major General in the armies of the United States.</p>
            <p>The next year Sabatis, with another Indian named Plauſawa,<note place="margin">1753.</note> came to Canter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury;<note place="margin">June, MS depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</note> where, being reproached with the miſconduct reſpecting the negroes, he and his companion behaved in an inſolent manner. Several perſons treated them very freely with ſtrong liquor. One followed them into the woods, and killed them, and by the help of another, buried them;
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:023166_0280_0FBC81881E6E4498"/>
but ſo ſhallow, that their bodies were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by beaſts of prey, and their bones lay on the ground. By the treaties of peace, it had been ſtipulated, on the one part, that if any of the Indians ſhould commit an act of hoſtility againſt the Engliſh, their young men ſhould join with the Engliſh in reducing ſuch Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans to ſubmiſſion; and on the other hand, that if an Engliſhman ſhould injure any of them, no private revenge ſhould be taken; but application ſhould be made to the government for juſtice. In the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn of the ſame year, a conference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing held, with the eaſtern Indians, by the government of Maſſachuſetts, a preſent was made to the Aroſaguntacook tribe,<note place="margin">Printed confer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, 1753.</note> expreſſive of an intention to wipe away the blood.

<q>all things ſhould be reſtored,<note place="margin">Printed treaty.</note> on the foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they were before the war.</q>
The iſland of Cape-Breton was accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to France; but the limits of the French and Engliſh territories on the continent, were undetermined; and it was the policy of both nations to gain poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of important paſſes, to which each had ſome pretenſions, and to hold them, till the limits ſhould be ſettled by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners mutually choſen. Theſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners met at Paris; but came to no deciſion. By the conſtruction of charters and grants from the Crown of England, her colonies extended indefinitely weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. The French had ſettlements in Canada and Louiſiana, and they meditat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to join theſe diſtant Colonies, by a chain of forts and poſts, from the St. Lawrence to the Miſſiſippi; and to extend
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:023166_0283_0FBC82BC88298210"/>
the limits of Canada, as far eaſtward, as to command navigation in the winter, when the great river St. Lawrence is impaſſable. Theſe claims of territory, extending on the one part from eaſt to weſt, and on the other from north to ſouth, neceſſarily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfered. The Colonies of Nova-Scotia, New-York and Virginia, were principally affected by this interference; and the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croachments made on them by the French, were a ſubject of complaint, both here and in Europe.</p>
            <p>It was foreſeen that this controverſy could not be decided but by the ſword; and the Engliſh determined to be early in their preparations.<note place="margin">1754.</note> The Earl of Holder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,<note place="margin">Shirley's letters and ſpeeches.</note> Secretary of State, wrote to the Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernors of the American Colonies, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending <hi>union</hi> for their mutual protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and defence.

            <p>With the plan of union, a repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was made to the King, of the danger in which the Colonies were involved. Cop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies of both were laid before the ſeveral Aſſemblies. They were fully ſenſible of their danger from the French; but they apprehended greater danger from the plan of union. Its fate was ſingular. It was rejected in America, becauſe it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to put too much power in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the hands of the King; and it was rejected in England, becauſe it was ſuppoſed to give too much power to the Aſſemblies of the Colonies. The miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try made another propoſal; that the Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor,<note place="margin">Franklin's Examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. 1766.</note> with one or two members of the Council, of each Colony, ſhould aſſemble, and conſult for the common defence, and draw on the Britiſh treaſury for the ſums expended; which ſhould be raiſed by a
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:023166_0286_0FBC82C114E91E70"/>
general tax, laid by Parliament, on the Colonies. But this was not a time to puſh ſuch an alarming innovation; and when it was found impracticable, the miniſtry determined to employ their own troops, to fight their battles in America, rather than to let the Coloniſts feel their own ſtrength, and be directed by their own Counſels.</p>
            <p>To draw ſome aid however from the Colonies was neceſſary. Their militia might ſerve as guards, or rangers, or la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borers, or do garriſon duty, or be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in other inferior offices; but Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh troops, commanded by Britiſh officers, muſt have the <hi>honor</hi> of reducing the French dominions in North America.</p>
            <p>The ſavage nations in the French inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt were always ready, on the firſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of a rupture, to take up the hatchet. It was the policy of the French government, to encourage their depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, on the frontiers of the Engliſh Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onies, to which they had a native antipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. By this means, the French could make their enemies pay the whole expenſe of a war; for all the ſupplies, which they afforded to the Indians, were amply com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſated, by the ranſom of captives. In theſe later wars, therefore, we find the
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:023166_0287_0FBC82C2CB7CCBC0"/>
ſavages more dextrous in taking captives, and more tender of them when taken, than in former wars; which were carried on with circumſtances of greater cruelty.</p>
            <p>No ſooner had the alarm of hoſtilities, which commenced between the Engliſh and French, in the weſtern part of Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia, ſpread through the continent; than the Indians renewed their attacks on the frontiers of New-Hampſhire. A party of them made an aſſault,<note place="margin">Aug. 15.</note> on a family at Baker's-town, on Pemigewaſſet river; where they killed a woman, and took ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral captives. Within three days they killed a man and woman at Steven's town in the ſame neighbourhood;<note place="margin">Aug. 18.</note> upon which the ſettlements were broken up,<note place="margin">Council minutes.</note> and the people retired to the lower towns for ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the government was obliged to poſt ſoldiers in the deſerted places. After a few days more,<note place="margin">Aug. 29.</note> they broke into the houſe of James Johnſon, at Number-four, early in the morning, before any of the family were awake; and took him, with his wife and three children, her ſiſter Miriam Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard, and two men, Peter Laboree and Ebenezer Farnſworth. The ſurpriſal was complete and bloodleſs,<note place="margin">Olcott's MS letter.</note> and they carried them off undiſturbed. The next day Johnſon's wife was delivered of a daughter,
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:023166_0288_0FBC82C5DEA3A0C0"/>
who from the circumſtances of its birth was named <hi>Captive.</hi> The Indians halted one day, on the woman's account, and the next day reſumed their march; carrying her on a litter, which they made for the purpoſe, and afterward put her on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back. On their march, they were diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for proviſion; and killed the horſe for food; the infant was nouriſhed, by ſuck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pieces of its fleſh. When they arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Montreal, Johnſon obtained a parole, of two months, to return and ſolicit the means of redemption. He applied to the Aſſembly of New-Hampſhire, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſome delay obtained one hundred and fifty pounds ſterling.<note place="margin">Dec. 19.</note> 
               <note place="margin">Aſſembly Records.</note> But the ſeaſon was ſo far advanced, and the winter proved ſo ſevere, that he did not reach Canada till the ſpring. He was then charged with breaking his parole; a great part of his money was taken from him by violence; and, he was ſhut up with his family in priſon; where they took the ſmall pox, which they happily ſurvived. After eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen months, the woman, with her ſiſter, and two daughters, were ſent in a cartel ſhip to England; and thence returned to Boſton. Johnſon was kept in priſon three years; and then, with his ſon, returned and met his wife in Boſton; where he had
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:023166_0289_0FBC82C70121F678"/>
the ſingular ill fortune, to be ſuſpected of deſigns unfriendly to his country, and was again impriſoned; but no evidence being produced againſt him, he was libe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. His eldeſt daughter was retained in a Canadian nunnery.</p>
            <p>The fort and ſettlement at Number-four, being in an expoſed ſituation, requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aſſiſtance and ſupport. It had been built by Maſſachuſetts when it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be within its limits. It was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected by Colonel Stoddard, of Northamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and was well ſituated, in connection with the other forts, on the weſtern fron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tier,<note place="margin">Shirley's MS letters.</note> to command all the paths, by which the Indians travelled from Canada to New-England. It was now evidently in New-Hampſhire; and Shirley, by advice of his Council, applied to Wentworth, recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending the future maintenance of that poſt, to the care of his Aſſembly; but they did not think themſelves intereſted in its preſervation, and refuſed to make any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for it. The inhabitants made ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral applications for the ſame purpoſe; but were uniformly diſappointed. They then made preſſing remonſtrances to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly of Maſſachuſetts,<note place="margin">Maſſachuſ· Records.</note> who ſent ſoldiers for the defence of that poſt, and of Fort Dum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, till 1757; when they ſuppoſed that
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:023166_0290_0FBC82C8CB8FD2D8"/>
the commander in chief of the King's forces would take them under his care, as royal garriſons. It was alſo recommended to the Aſſembly of New-Hampſhire to build a fort at Cohos; but this propoſal met the ſame fate.</p>
            <p>The next ſpring, three expeditions were undertaken againſt the French forts.<note place="margin">1755.</note> One againſt Fort Duqueſne, on the Ohio, was conducted by General Braddock; who was defeated and ſlain. Another againſt Niagara, by Governor Shirley, which miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carried; and a third againſt Crown Point, by General Johnſon. For this laſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, New-Hampſhire raiſed five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, and put them under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of Col. Joſeph Blanchard. The Governor ordered them to Connecticut riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, to build a fort at Cohos, ſuppoſing it to be in their way to Crown Point. They firſt marched to Baker's-town, where they began to build batteaux, and conſumed time and proviſions to no purpoſe. By Shirley's advice they quitted that futile employment, and made a fatiguing march through the woods, by the way of Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-four, to Albany. Whilſt Johnſon lay encamped at Lake George, with his other forces, he poſted the New-Hampſhire regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at Fort Edward. On the eighth of
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:023166_0291_0FBC82C9F3D17508"/>
September, he was attacked in his camp, by Baron Dieſkau, commanding a body of French regular troops,<note place="margin">Sept. 8.</note> Canadians and Savages. On the morning of that day, a ſcouting party from Fort Edward diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed waggons burning in the road; upon which Captain Nathaniel Folſom was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered out, with eighty of the New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire regiment, and forty of New-York under Capt. McGennis. When they came to the place, they found the waggoners and the cattle dead; but no enemy was there. Hearing the report of guns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward the lake, they haſted thither; and having approached within two miles, found the baggage of the French army, under the care of a guard, whom they attacked and diſperſed. When the retreating army of Dieſkau appeared, about four of the clock in the afternoon,<note place="margin">Folſom's informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> Folſom poſted his men among the trees, and kept up a well directed fire, till night; the enemy retired, with great loſs, and he made his way to the camp, carrying his own wounded, and ſeveral French priſoners, with many of the enemy's packs. This well-timed engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,<note place="margin">

camp the next day. After this, the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of New-Hampſhire joined the army. The men were employed in ſcouting,<note place="margin">Atkinſon's MS letters.</note> which ſervice they performed in a manner ſo acceptable, that no other duty was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of them. Parties of them frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went within view of the French fort at Crown-Point; and at one time they brought off the ſcalp of a French ſoldier, whom they killed near the gate.</p>
            <p>After the engagement on the 8th of September, when it was found neceſſary to reinforce the army; a ſecond regiment, of three hundred men, was raiſed in New-Hampſhire, and put under the command of Col. Peter Gilman. Theſe men were as alert, and indefatigable as their brethren, though they had not opportunity to give such convincing evidence of it. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedition was no farther purſued; and late <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

communication by ſhort carrying-places, with which they were perfectly acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The Indians of that river, therefore, made frequent incurſions, and returned unmoleſted with their priſoners and booty.</p>
            <p>At New-Hopkinton, they took a man and a boy; but perceiving the approach of a ſcouting party,<note place="margin">Sum<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At Keene, they took Ben<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jamin Twitchel, and at Walpole they kill-Daniel Twitchel, and a man named Flynt. At the ſame place Colonel Bellows, at the head of twenty men,<note place="margin">Feſſenden's MS letter.</note> met with a party of fifty Indians; and having exchanged ſome ſhot, and killed ſeveral of the enemy, he broke through them and got into the fort; not one man of his company being killed or wounded. After a few days, theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, being joined by others to the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of one hundred and ſeventy, aſſaulted the garriſon of John Kilburne, in which were himſelf, John Pike, two boys and ſeveral women; who bravely defended the houſe and obliged the enemy to retire, with conſiderable loſs. Pike was mortally wounded. Some of theſe Indians joined Dieſkau's army, and were in the battle at Lake George. At Number-four, they killed a large number of cattle, and cut off the fleſh. At Hinſdale, they attacked a
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:023166_0294_0FBC82D0B3E051B8"/>
party, who were at work in the woods; killed John Hardiclay and John Alexan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and took Jonathan Colby;<note place="margin">Gay's MS letter.</note> the others eſcaped to the fort. Within a few days afterward, they ambuſhed Caleb Howe, Hilkiah Grout, and Benjamin Gaffield, as they were returning from their labor in the field. Howe was killed;<note place="margin">July 27.</note> Gaffield was drowned in attemping to croſs the river; and Grout made his eſcape. The Indians went directly to Bridgman's fort, where the families of theſe unfortunate men re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided. They had heard the report of the guns, and were impatient to learn the cauſe. By the ſound of feet without, it being in the duſk of the evening, they concluded that their friends had returned, and too haſtily opened the gate to receive them; when to their inexpreſſible ſurpriſe, they admitted the ſavages, and the three families, conſiſting of fourteen perſons, were made captives.<note n="*" place="bottom">

This village had been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riched with the plunder of the frontiers and the ſale of captives. The houſes were well furniſhed, and the church was adorned with plate. The ſuddenneſs of the attack, and the fear of a purſuit, did not allow much time for pillage; but the rangers brought off ſuch things as were moſt convenient for tranſportation; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong which were about two hundred guineas in money, a ſilver image weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ten pounds, a large quantity of wampum and clothing. Having ſet fire to the village, Rogers made his retreat up the river St. Francis, intending that his men ſhould rendezvous at the upper Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hos, on Connecticut river. They took with them five Engliſh priſoners, whom they found at St. Francis, and about twenty Indians; but theſe laſt they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed.

            <p>After the taking of Quebec, the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of the ſeaſon was too ſhort to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the reduction of Canada.

            <p>The conqueſt of Canada, gave peace to the frontiers of New-Hampſhire, after a turbulent ſcene of fifteen years; in which, with very little intermiſſion, they had been diſtreſſed by the enemy.

In 1755 paper bills were iſſued under the denomination of new tenor; of which, fifteen ſhillings were equal in value to one dollar. Of this currency, the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers were promiſed thirteen pounds ten ſhillings per month; but it depreciated ſo much in the courſe of the year, that in the muſter rolls, their pay was made up at fifteen pounds. In 1756 there was another emiſſion from the ſame plates, and their pay was eighteen pounds. In 1757, it was twenty-five pounds. In 1758,<note place="margin">Atkinſon's MS letters.</note> they had twenty-ſeven ſhillings ſterling. In the three ſucceeding years, they had thirty ſhillings ſterling, beſides a bounty at the time of their inliſtment, equal to one month's pay.

            <p>It ought to be remembered as a ſignal favor of divine Providence; that during this war, the ſeaſons were fruitful, and the Colonies were able to ſupply their own troops with proviſions, and the Britiſh fleets and armies with refreſhments of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery kind which they needed.

Had this calamity attended any of the preceding years of the war, the diſtreſs muſt have been extreme, both at home and in the camp. During the drought of 1761, a fire raged in the woods, in the towns of of Barrington and Roch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſter, and paſſed over into the county of York, burning with irreſiſtable fury for ſeveral weeks, and was not extinguiſhed till a plentiful rain fell, in Auguſt.

The ſucceſs which attended their operations in that quarter, brought the war to a concluſion; and by the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of peace, though many of the conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed places were reſtored, yet, the whole continent of North America remained to the Britiſh Crown, and the Colonies re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a reimburſement of their expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
            <p>The war being cloſed, a large and valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able tract of country, ſituated between New-England, New-York and Canada, was ſecured to the Britiſh dominions; and it became the intereſt of the Governors of both the royal Provinces of New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire and New-York, to vie with each other, in granting this territory and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving the emoluments ariſing from this lucrative branch of their reſpective offices. The ſeeds of a controverſy on this ſubject had been already ſown. During the ſhort peace which followed the preceding war, Governor Wentworth wrote to Governor Clinton,<note place="margin">1749.</note> that he had it in command from the King,<note place="margin">Nov. 17.</note> to grant the unimproved lands within his government;<note place="margin">Council minutes.</note> that the war had prevented that progreſs, which he had <hi>hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for</hi> in this buſineſs; but that the peace

had induced many people, to apply for grants in the weſtern parts of New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,<note place="margin">N. York printed narrative. Appendix, No. 3.</note> which might fall in the neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood of New-York. He communicated to him a paragraph of his commiſſion, deſcribing the bounds of New-Hampſhire, and requeſted of him a deſcription of the bounds of New-York. Before he receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any anſwer to this letter; Wentworth, preſuming that New-Hampſhire ought to extend as far weſtward as Maſſachuſetts; that is to the diſtance of twenty miles eaſt from Hudſon's river, granted a townſhip, ſix miles ſquare, called Bennington; ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate twenty-four miles eaſt of Hudſon's river,<note place="margin">1750.</note> and ſix miles north of the line of Maſſachuſetts. Clinton having laid Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth's letter before the Council of New-York;<note place="margin">N. Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire book of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> by their advice anſwered him, that the Province of New-York was bounded eaſterly by Connecticut river. This claim was founded on a grant of King Charles the ſecond; in which,
<q>all the land from the weſt ſide of Connecticut river, to the eaſt ſide of Delaware bay,</q>
was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed to his brother James, Duke of York; by whoſe elevation to the throne, the ſame tract merged in the crown of England, and deſcended at the Revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to King William and his ſucceſſors.
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:023166_0310_0FBC82F189A9D4C8"/>
The Province of New-York had formerly urged this claim againſt the Colony of Connecticut; but for prudential reaſons had conceded that the bounds of that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony ſhould extend, as far as a line drawn twenty miles eaſt of Hudſon's river. The like extent was demanded by Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts; and, though New-York affected to call this demand 'an intruſion,' and ſtren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uouſly urged their right to extend eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to Connecticut river; yet the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal grant of Maſſachuſetts, being prior to that of the Duke of York, was a barrier which could not eaſily be broken. Theſe reaſons, however, it was ſaid, could be of no avail to the cauſe of New-Hampſhire, whoſe firſt limits, as deſcribed in Maſon's patent, did not reach to Connecticut river; and whoſe late extent, by the ſettlement of the lines in 1741, was no farther weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward than
<q>till it meets with the King's other governments.</q>
Though it was agreed, between the two Governors, to ſubmit the point in controverſy to the King; yet the Governor of New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, continued to make grants, on the weſtern ſide of Connecticut river, till 1754; when the renewal of hoſtilities not only put a ſtop to applications; but pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented

            <p>The paſſion for occupying new lands roſe to a great height. Theſe tracts were filled with emigrants from Maſſachuſetts and Connecticut. Population and culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation began to increaſe with a rapidity hitherto unknown; and from this time

            <head>CHAP. XXIII. Beginning of the controverſy with Great-Britain. Stamp act. Reſignation of <hi>BEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NING WENTWORTH.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>FROM the earlieſt eſtabliſhment of the American Colonies, a jealouſy of their independence had exiſted among the people of Great-Britain. At firſt, this apprehenſion was perhaps no more than a conjecture founded on the viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of human affairs, or on their know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of thoſe emigrants who came away from England, diſguſted with the abuſive treatment which they had endured at home. But from whatever cauſe it aroſe, it was ſtrengthened by age; and the conduct of the Britiſh government toward America, was frequently influenced by it. In the reign of James the first,
<q>ſpeculative rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners raiſed objections to the planting of theſe Colonies; and foretold,<note place="margin">Hume.</note> that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter draining the mother country of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, they would ſhake off her yoke and erect an independent government.</q>
Some traces of this jealouſy appeared in every ſucceeding reign,<note place="margin">See vol 1. page 309.</note> not excepting that of William, whom America, as well as
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:023166_0317_0FBC82FDB85A54A0"/>
Britain, was proud to ſtyle
<q>our great deliverer.</q>
But it became moſt evident, and began to produce its moſt pernicious effects, at a time when there was the leaſt reaſon for indulging the idea.</p>
            <p>During the adminiſtration of PITT, a liberal kind of policy had been adopted toward the Colonies; which being crown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with ſucceſs, had attached us<note n="*" place="bottom">Though It may be accounted a deviation from the proper ſtyle of hiſtory, for the author to ſpeak in the firſt perſon; yet he hopes to be excuſed in expreſſing the feelings of an American, whilſt be relates the hiſtory of his own time, and his own country.</note> more firmly than ever, to the kingdom of Britain. We were proud of our connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with a nation whoſe flag was triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant in every quarter of the globe; and by whoſe aſſiſtance we had been delivered from the danger of our moſt formidable enemies, the French in Canada. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of George the third,<note place="margin">1760.</note> at this criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal and important era, was celebrated here, with as true zeal and loyalty, as in any part of his dominions. We were fond of repeating every plaudit, which the ardent affection of the Britiſh nation beſtowed on a young monarch, riſing to the throne of his anceſtors, and profeſſing to
<q>glory in the name of Briton.</q>
At ſuch a time, nothing could have been more eaſy, than by purſuing the ſyſtem of commercial reg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulation,
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:023166_0318_0FBC82FF45D462C8"/>
already eſtabliſhed, and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the indulgencies which had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, to have drawn the whole profit of our labor and trade, into the hands of britiſh merchants and manufacturers. This would have prevented a ſpirit of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe in the Colonies, and kept us in as complete ſubjection and dependence, as the moſt ſanguine friend of the Britiſh nation could have wiſhed.</p>
            <p>We had, among ourſelves, a ſet of men, who,<note place="margin">1763.</note> ambitious of perpetuating the rank of their families,<note place="margin">Bernard's ſelect let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> were privately ſeeking the eſtabliſhment of an <hi>American Nobili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi>; out of which,<note place="margin">Oliver's letters.</note> an intermediate branch of legiſlation, between the royal and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocratic powers, ſhould be appointed. Plans were drawn, and preſented to the Britiſh miniſtry, for new modelling our governments, and reducing their powers; whilſt the authority of Parliament ſhould be rendered abſolute and imperial. The military gentlemen of Britain, who had ſerved here in the war, and on whom, a profuſion of grateful attention had been beſtowed, carried home reports of our wealth; whilſt the ſons of our merchants and planters, who went to England for their education, exhibited ſpecimens of prodigality which confirmed the idea.
<pb n="320" facs="unknown:023166_0319_0FBC8300CE418558"/>
During the war, there had been a great influx of money; and at the concluſion of it, Britiſh goods were largely imported; by which means, the caſh went back again with a rapid circulation.</p>
            <p>In no age, perhaps, excepting that in which Rome loſt her liberty, was the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of venality and corruption ſo prevalent as at this time,<note place="margin">Hiſtory of the minor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Exhauſted by a long war, and diſgraced by a peace which deprived her of her moſt valuable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts, the national ſupplies were inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to the continual drain of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>checquer. A new miniſtry, raiſed on the ruin of that by which America was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered and ſecured, looked to this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as a ſource of revenue. But, neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the 'principles of law and polity, which had been early ſuggeſted to them by an officious correſpondent;<note place="margin">Bernard's ſelect let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> and by which they might have gradually and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently extended their ſyſtem of corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion into America; they planned mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures by which they ſuppoſed an addition to the revenues of Britain might be drawn from America; and the pretence was,
<q>to defray the expenſes of protecting, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending and ſecuring it.</q>
The fallacy of this pretence was eaſily ſeen. If we had not done our part toward the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:023166_0320_0FBC830230770738"/>
and defence of our country, why were our expenditures reimburſed by Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament? The truth is, that during the whole war, we had exerted ourſelves be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond our ability; relying on a promiſe from a Secretary of State, that it ſhould be recommended to Parliament to make us compenſation. It was recommended; the compenſation was honorably granted, and gratefully received. The idea of drawing that money from us again by taxes to repay the charges of our former de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, was unjuſt and inconſiſtent. If the new conqueſts needed protection or defence, thoſe who reaped the gain of their commerce, or enjoyed the benefit of grants and offices within thoſe territories, might be required to contribute their aid. Notwithſtanding this pretext, it was our opinion, that the grand object was to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for dependents, and to extend the corrupt and venal principle of crown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, through every part of the Britiſh dominions. However artfully it was thrown out, that the revenue to be drawn from us would eaſe the taxes of our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren in Britain, or diminiſh the load of national debt; it was not eaſy for us to believe that the miniſtry had either of theſe objects ſincerely in contemplation. But
<pb n="322" facs="unknown:023166_0321_0FBC8303AE559E38"/>
if it had been ever ſo equitable that we ſhould contribute to diſcharge the debt of the nation, incurred by the preceding war; we ſuppoſed that the monopoly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol of our commerce, which Britain en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed, was a full equivalent for all the advantages, which we reaped from our po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical connexion with her.</p>
            <p>The ſame gazette, which contained the definitive treaty of peace,<note place="margin">N. Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire Ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zette, May 27.</note> announced the intentions of the Britiſh miniſtry to quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter troops in America, and ſupport them at our expenſe. The money was to be raiſed by a duty on foreign ſugar and molaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and by ſtamps on all papers legal and mercantile. Theſe intentions were at firſt thrown out in the form of reſolves, and afterward digeſted into acts of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament. The firſt of theſe acts, reſtricting the intercourſe which the American Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies had enjoyed with the Weſt-India iſlands,<note place="margin">1764.</note> cauſed a general uneaſineſs and ſuſpicion, but was viewed as a regulation of trade, and was ſubmitted to, though with reluctance. The effect of this act was to call forth a ſpirit of frugality, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly in the introduction of a leſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſive mode of conducing funerals. Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions and remonſtrances were ſent to England by ſome of the Colonies; but
<pb n="323" facs="unknown:023166_0322_0FBC830819C580F0"/>
inſtead of any redreſs,<note place="margin">1765.</note> a new act of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament was made for raiſing a revenue by a general ſtamp duty through all the American Colonies. The true friends of conſtitutional liberty now ſaw their deareſt intereſts in danger; from an aſſumption of power in the parent ſtate to give and grant the property of the coloniſts at their pleaſure. Even thoſe who had been ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alterations in the colonial governments, and an eſtabliſhment of hereditary honors, plainly ſaw that the miniſtry were deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous of plucking the fruit,<note place="margin">Bernard's ſelect let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note> before they had grafted the ſtock on which it muſt grow. To render the new act leſs odious to us, ſome of our fellow citizens were appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſtribute the ſtamped paper, which was prepared in England and brought over in bales. The framers of the act <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>oaſted that it was ſo contrived as to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute itſelf; becauſe no writing could be deemed legal without the ſtamp; and all controverſies which might ariſe, were to be determined in the Courts of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, by a ſingle judge, entirely dependent on the Crown.</p>
            <p>This direct and violent attack on our deareſt privileges at firſt threw us into a ſilent gloom; and we were at a loſs how to proceed. To ſubmit, was to rivet the
<pb n="324" facs="unknown:023166_0323_0FBC8308F6C1E9F0"/>
ſhackles of ſlavery on ourſelves and our poſterity. To revolt, was to rend aſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the moſt endearing connexion, and hazard the reſentment of a powerful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In this dilemma, the Houſe of Burgeſſes in Virginia,<note place="margin">May 28.</note> paſſed ſome ſpirited reſolves, aſſerting the rights of their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and denying the claim of parliament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary taxation. The Aſſembly of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts propoſed a Congreſs of Deputies from each Colony,<note place="margin">June 6.</note> to conſult upon our common intereſt, as had frequently been practiſed in times of common danger. Several ſpeeches made in Parliament by oppoſers of the ſtamp-act were reprinted here; in one of which the Americans were ſtyled 'Sons of liberty,' and the ſpeaker ventured,<note place="margin">Col. Bar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>.</note> from his perſonal knowledge of this country, to foretel our oppoſition to the act.</p>
            <p>The ſpirit of the Virginian reſolves, like an electric ſpark, diffuſed itſelf in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly and univerſally; and the cautious propoſal of Maſſachuſetts was generally approved. The anxious mind, reſting on the bold aſſertion of conſtitutional rights, looked forward with pleaſure, to the time when an American Congreſs would unite in a ſucceſsful defence of them. The title 'Sons of liberty,' was eagerly adopted by
<pb n="325" facs="unknown:023166_0324_0FBC830AB2FCB048"/>
aſſociations in every Colony; determining to carry into execution the prediction of him, who with ſuch noble energy, had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ſpouſed the cauſe of our freedom. They began the oppoſition at Boſton; by pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licly exhibiting effigies of the enemies of America, and obliging the ſtamp-officer to reſign his employment. The popular commotions in that town were afterward carried to an unjuſtifiable exceſs; but the ſpirit of oppoſition animated the body of the people in every Colony.</p>
            <p>The perſon appointed diſtributor of ſtamps for New-Hampſhire, was George Meſſervè, ſon of the late Colonel, who died at Louiſbourg. He received his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment in England, and ſoon after embarked for America, and arrived at Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. Before he landed, he was informed of the oppoſition which was making to the act;<note place="margin">Sept. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <note place="margin">Sept. 18.</note> and at his coming to town he made a ſecond reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, on the parade, before he went to his own houſe.

meaſures. Soon after, the ſtamped paper deſtined for New-Hampſhire arrived at Boſton in the ſame veſſel with that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for Maſſachuſetts; but there being no perſon in either Province who had any concern with it, it was, by order of Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Bernard, lodged in the caſtle.</p>
            <p>The ſtamp-act was to commence its operation on the firſt day of November; previouſly to which the appointed Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs was formed at New-York, conſiſting of delegates from the Aſſemblies of Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, Rhode-Iſland, Connecticut, New-York, New-Jerſey, Pennſylvania, the Del<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aware Counties, Maryland and South-Carolina. Having, like the Congreſs at Albany in 1754, formed themſelves in geographical order; they framed a bill of rights, for the Colonies; in which the ſole power of taxation was declared to be in their own aſſemblies. They prepared three diſtinct addreſſes to the King, Lords and Commons, ſtating their grievances, and aſking for redreſs. Theſe were ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by the delegates of ſix Colonies; the others who were preſent were not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to ſign; but reported their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings to their conſtituents, who ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved them in Aſſembly, and forwarded their petitions.

the Aſſembly at their next meeting adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſame meaſures, and ſent ſimilar pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions to England, which they committed to Barlow Trecothick, their agent,<note place="margin">Aſſembly Records.</note> and John Wentworth, a young gentleman of Portſmouth, who was then in England, to be by them preſented to the King and Parliament. Theſe meaſures were the moſt reſpectful and prudent which could be deviſed; and were attended with ſome proſpect of ſucceſs from a change which had been made in the Britiſh miniſtry.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the newſpapers were filled with eſſays, in which every plea for and againſt the new duties was amply diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſſed. Theſe vehicles of intelligence were doomed to be loaded with a ſtamp; and the printers felt themſelves intereſted in the oppoſition. On the laſt day of October, the New-Hampſhire Gazette appeared with a mourning border. A body of people from the country approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the town of Portſmouth, under an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion that the ſtamps would be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed; but being met, by a number from the town, and aſſured that no ſuch thing was intended, they quietly returned. The next day, the bells tolled, and a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral proceſſion was made for the Goddeſs of Liberty;<note place="margin">Nov. 1.</note> but on depoſiting her in the

grave, ſome ſigns of life were ſuppoſed to be diſcovered, and ſhe was carried off in triumph. By ſuch exhibitions, the ſpirit of the populace was kept up; though the minds of the moſt thoughtful perſons were filled with anxiety.</p>
            <p>It was doubtful, whether the Courts of Law could proceed without ſtamps; and it was certain that none could be procured. Some licentious perſons began to think that debts could not be recovered, and that they might inſult their creditors with impunity. On the firſt appearance of this diſorderly ſpirit, aſſociations were formed at Portſmouth, Exeter and other places, to ſupport the Magiſtrates and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the peace. The fifth of November had always been obſerved as a day of hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity, in remembrance of the powder-plot. On the following night, a ſtrong guard was kept in Portſmouth. By theſe precautions, the tendency to riot was ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonably checked, and no waſte of property or perſonal inſult was committed; though ſome obnoxious characters began to trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for their ſafety.</p>
            <p>When Meſſervè arrived, the people ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that he had brought his commiſſion with him, and were content that it ſhould remain in his own hands, being rendered
<pb n="329" facs="unknown:023166_0328_0FBC83132151A5D8"/>
void by his reſignation. But, in fact, he did not receive it till after the time fixed for the operation of the act. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſhown his inſtructions to the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and ſome other public officers, it was ſuſpected that he intended
<q>to commence the execution of his office.</q>

An oath was admin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtered to him by Juſtice Claget, purport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he would neither directly nor in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>directly attempt to execute his office. The maſter of a ſhip, then ready to ſail for England, was alſo ſworn to deliver the packet containing the commiſſion and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions, as it was directed. It was firſt addreſſed to the Commiſſioners of the ſtamp-office in London; but afterward it was encloſed in a letter to the agents of the Province, refering the diſpoſal of it to their diſcretion. It happened to arrive, when great exertions were making, and a ſtrong probability exiſted, of the repeal of the ſtamp-act. The agents therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed the packet, and had the good for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to ſuppreſs the intelligence of all
<pb n="330" facs="unknown:023166_0329_0FBC831441285B30"/>
theſe proceedings; that no irritation might enſue to prevent the expected re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal.</p>
            <p>During all theſe commotions, Governor Wentworth was ſilent. The miniſtry, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther by accident or deſign, had neglected to ſend authentic copies of the ſtamp-act, to ſome of the American Governors, and to him among others. There had been no tumults, which rendered his interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion neceſſary. He was in the decline of life, and his health was much impaired. His fortune was made, and it lay chiefly in his native country. One of the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons given, for the removal of his prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor, was, that he had enjoyed his office ten years; Mr. Wentworth had been twenty-five years in the chair, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſoon to be ſuperſeded. It was therefore his intereſt, not to put himſelf forward in ſupport of unpopular mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures. His example was followed by moſt of the gentlemen in the Province, who held offices under the Crown. If any of them were ſecretly in favor of the act, they were reſtrained by fear, from con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting openly the voice of the people.</p>
            <p>The popular ſpirit was ſufficiently rouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to join in any meaſures which might be neceſſary for the defence of liberty.
<pb n="331" facs="unknown:023166_0330_0FBC8315EFA48C68"/>
All fear of the conſequence of proceeding in the public buſineſs without ſtamps, was gradually laid aſide. The courts of law, and cuſtom houſes were kept open. Newspapers circulated, and licenſes for marriage, without ſtamps, were publicly advertiſed. As it was uncertain, what might be the event of the petitions to the King and Parliament, it was thought beſt, to awaken the attention of the merchants and manufacturers of England, by an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement to import no goods, until the ſtamp-act ſhould be repealed. To pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for the worſt, an aſſociation was formed by the 'ſons of liberty' in all the northern Colonies, to ſtand by each other, and unite their whole force, for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and relief of any who might be in danger, from the operation of this, or any other oppreſſive act. The letters which paſſed between them,<note place="margin">MS letters of the ſons of liberty.</note> on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, are replete with expreſſions of loyal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and affection to the King, his perſon, family and authority. Had there been any diſaffection to the royal government, or deſire to ſhake off our allegiance, where would the evidence of it be more likely to be found, than in letters which paſſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween bodies of men, who were avowedly endeavoring, to form an union, to reſiſt
<pb n="332" facs="unknown:023166_0331_0FBC831A22B04F60"/>
the uſurped authority of the Britiſh Lords and Commons?<note n="*" place="bottom">From an intimate acquaintance with many perſons, of all ranks, who were inſtrumental of conducting the American revolution, through all its ſtages; and from a peruſal of many of their confidential letters; the author of theſe ſheets is fully ſatisfied, that the public profeſſions of loyalty, made by his countrymen, were ſincere; and that the moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined oppoſers of the claims of Parliament, were very far from de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring a diſunion of the Britiſh empire, till they were driven to it by neceſſity.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The idea which we entertained of our political connexion with the Britiſh em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, was, that the King was its ſupreme head; that every branch of it was a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect State, competent to its own internal legiſlation, but ſubject to the control and negative of the ſovereign; that taxation and repreſentation were correlative, and therefore that no part of the empire could be taxed, but by its own Repreſentatives in Aſſembly. From a regard to the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral intereſt, it was conceded, that the Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament of Great-Britain, repreſenting the firſt and moſt powerful branch of the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire, might regulate the exterior com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the whole. In Britain, the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican governments were conſidered as corporations, exiſting by the pleaſure of the King and Parliament, who had a right to alter or diſſolve them. Our laws were deemed bye-laws; and we were ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be, in all caſes of legiſlation and
<pb n="333" facs="unknown:023166_0332_0FBC831B07A6E490"/>
taxation, ſubject to the ſupreme, undefin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed power of the Britiſh Parliament. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween claims ſo widely different, there was no arbitrator to decide. Temporary expedients, if wiſely applied, might have preſerved peace; but the moſt delicate and judicious management was neceſſary, to prevent irritation.</p>
            <p>When the commotions which had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in America, were known in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, a circular letter was written to the ſeveral governors, by Secretary Conway,<note place="margin">Oct. 24. 1765.</note> in which it was
<q>
                  <hi>hoped</hi> that the reſiſtance to the authority of the mother country, had only found place among the lower and more ignorant of the people.</q>
To the conſtitutional authority (as we underſtood it) of the King and Parliament, there had been no reſiſtance; but to the aſſumed authority, of our fellow ſubjects in Britain, over our property, the reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance began, and was ſupported by the Repreſentatives of the people, in their Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies. Thoſe who appeared under the name of 'the ſons of liberty' were chiefly tradeſmen of reputation, who were occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionally aſſiſted by lawyers, clergymen, and other perſons of literary abilities. The writings of Sydney and Locke were produced, in evidence of the juſtice of our
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:023166_0333_0FBC831C798A1A40"/>
claims; and the arguments which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly been uſed in England, againſt the uſurpations of the houſe of Stuart, were adopted and repeated by us, in favor of our rights and liberties. Political inquiries were encouraged, and the eyes of the people were opened. Never was a ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment more generally adopted, on the full<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt conviction, than that we could be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutionally taxed by none but our own Repreſentatives; and that all aſſumption of this power, by any other body of men, was uſurpation which might be lawfully reſiſted.</p>
            <p>The petitions of the American Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies, enforced by the agreement for non-importation, and aided by the exertions of the Britiſh merchants and manufactur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, induced the new miniſtry to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend to Parliament, a repeal of the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſtamp-act.<note place="margin">March 18.</note> It was accordingly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed; not on the true principle of its repugnancy to the rights of America; but on that of political expediency. Even on this principle, the repeal could be obtained by no other means; than by paſſing, at the ſame time, a declaratory act, aſſerting the right and power, of the Britiſh Parliament,
<q>to <hi>bind</hi> America, in all caſes whatſoever,</q>
and annulling all
<pb n="335" facs="unknown:023166_0334_0FBC831E30D0C7C8"/>
the reſolutions of our Aſſemblies, in which they had claimed the right of exemption from Parliamentary taxation.</p>
            <p>The rejoicings which were occaſioned by the repeal of the ſtamp-act, in this country, were extravagantly diſpropor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the object. We felt a tranſient relief from an intolerable burden; but the claim of ſovereign power, in our fellow ſubjects, to take our property, and abridge our liberty at their pleaſure, was eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by law. Our only hope was, that they would profit by their recent experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; and whilſt they enjoyed the pride of ſeeing their claim exiſt on paper, would ſuſpend the exerciſe of it in future.</p>
            <p>With the repealing and declaratory acts, a circular letter came from Secretary Conway; in which,
<q>the lenity and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, the moderation and forbearance of the Parliament toward the Colonies</q>
were celebrated in the language of pane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyric, and we were called upon, to ſhow our
<q>reſpectful gratitude and cheerful obedience,</q>
in return for ſuch a
<q>ſignal diſplay of indulgence and affection.</q>
This letter encloſed a reſolution of Parli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ament, that thoſe perſons who had
<q>ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered any injury or damage,</q>
in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their aſſiſting to
<q>execute the
<pb n="336" facs="unknown:023166_0335_0FBC83214F157B10"/>
late act, ought to be compenſated, by the Colonies, in which ſuch injuries were ſuſtained.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When Governor Wentworth laid this letter before the Aſſembly, he told them
<q>with pleaſure and ſatisfaction,<note place="margin">June 25.</note> that he had <hi>no</hi> requiſition of this kind to make.</q>
Meſſervè, however, applied to the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to grant him a compenſation for the injuries which he ſaid he had ſuffered. A committee, being appointed to inquire in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ground of his petition, reported,
<q>that he had ſuffered no real damage either in perſon or property; but that when any danger had been expected, guards had been appointed to protect him.</q>
Upon this report, his petition was diſmiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He afterward went to England and obtained the office of Collector of the the Cuſtoms.</p>
            <p>At this ſeſſion, the Aſſembly prepared a reſpectful addreſs to the King and both Houſes of Parliament, on account of the repeal; which was ſent to England, at the ſame time that the ſtamped paper and parchment, which had been depoſited at caſtle in Boſton, were returned.</p>
            <p>Complaints had been made in England againſt ſome of the American Governors, and other public officers, that exorbitant

He had alſo been accuſed of negligence in correſponding with the King's miniſters; of informality and want of accuracy in his grants of land; and of paſſing acts of Aſſembly reſpecting private property, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a ſuſpending clauſe
<q>till his Majeſty's pleaſure could be known.</q>
In his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of Surveyor-General he had been charged with neglect of duty, and with indulging his deputies in ſelling and waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the King's timber. By whom theſe complaints were made, and by what evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence they were ſupported, I have not been able to diſcover. Certain it is, that ſuch an impreſſion was made on the minds of the miniſtry, that a reſolution was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken to remove him; but the difficulties attending the ſtamp-act, cauſed a delay in the appointment of a ſucceſſor. When the ferment had ſubſided, the attention of the miniſtry was turned to this object. JOHN WENTWORTH, ſon of Mark Hunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wentworth, and nephew of the Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor, was then in England. He had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared
<pb n="338" facs="unknown:023166_0337_0FBC8324AFA1C190"/>
at Court, as a joint agent with Mr. Trecothick in preſenting the petition of the Province againſt the ſtamp-act. He had become acquainted with ſeveral families of high rank and of his own name, in Yorkſhire, and in particular with the Marquis of Rockingham, then at the head of the miniſtry. By his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence, Mr. Wentworth prevailed to ſoften the rigor of government againſt his uncle. Inſtead of being cenſured and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from office, he was allowed oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to <hi>reſign,</hi> and the appearance of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning in favor of his nephew, who was deſtined by the Marquis, to be his ſucceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſor. Having received his commiſſions. as Governor of New-Hampſhire, and Surveyor of the King's woods in North America,<note place="margin">Auguſt 11.</note> Mr. Wentworth ſailed from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and arrived at Charleſtown, in South-Carolina.<note place="margin">1767.</note> Thence he travelled through the continent,<note place="margin">March.</note> regiſtering his commiſſion of Surveyor in each of the Colonies, and was received at Portſmouth, with every mark of reſpect and affection. This ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,<note place="margin">June 13.</note> made by a popular miniſtry, was peculiarly grateful to the people of New-Hampſhire, by whom Mr. Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth was well known and much eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="339" facs="unknown:023166_0338_0FBC83299D8EE500"/>In addition to what has been ſaid, of the ſuperſeded Governor, it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved; that his natural abilities were nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther brilliant nor contemptible. As a private gentleman he was obliging, and as a merchant honorable. He was gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and hoſpitable to his friends; but his paſſions were ſtrong and his reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments laſting. He was ſubject to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and long continued viſits of the gout; a diſtemper rather unfriendly to the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of patience. In his deportment there was an appearance of haughtineſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted by his reſidence in Spain, where he learned the manners of the people of rank; as well as the maxims of their gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. He thought it beſt that the higheſt offices, ſhould be filled with men of property; and though in ſome inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces he deviated from this principle, yet, in others, he adhered to it ſo cloſely, as to diſregard more neceſſary qualifications.</p>
            <p>In the former part of his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, he was ſcrupulous in obeying his inſtructions, and inflexible in maintaining the prerogative. In conducting the ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations of two ſucceſſive wars, his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſervice was very conſpicuous; and he frequently received letters of thanks, from the Generals, and other of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers
<pb n="340" facs="unknown:023166_0339_0FBC832B81E67340"/>
of the Britiſh troops employed in America.</p>
            <p>He was cloſely attached to the intereſt of the church of England; and in his grants of townſhips, reſerved a right for the ſociety for propagating the goſpel, of which he was a member. A project was formed during his adminiſtration, to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh a college in New-Hampſhire. When he was applied to for a charter, he declin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed giving it, unleſs the college were put under the direction of the Biſhop of Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don. But, when a grant was made by the Aſſembly, of three hundred pounds ſterling, to Harvard College, where he had received his education, to repair the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction which it had ſuffered by fire; he conſented to the vote, and his name is inſcribed on an alcove of the library, as a benefactor, in conjunction with the name of the Province.</p>
            <p>In his appointment of civil and milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry officers, he was frequently governed by motives of favor, or prejudice to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons. When he came to the chair he found but twenty-five Juſtices of the Peace in the whole Province; but in the firſt commiſſion which he iſſued, he nominated as many in the town of Portſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth only. In the latter part of his time, appointments of this kind became ſo num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous,
<pb n="341" facs="unknown:023166_0340_0FBC832CEF212F80"/>
and were ſo eaſily procured, that the office was rendered contemptible.<note n="*" place="bottom">The following paſquinade was publiſhed in the Portſmouth Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury of October 7, 1765.

Though he was highly cenſured, for granting the beſt lands of the Province to the people of Maſſachuſetts and Connecticut, with views of pecuniary reward; yet, the true intereſt of the country was certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly promoted; becauſe the grantees in general, were better huſbandmen than the people of New-Hampſhire.</p>
            <p>In thoſe caſes, where diſſatisfaction ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, it was chiefly owing to the nature of a royal government, in which the ariſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tocratic feature was prominent, and the democratic too much depreſſed. The people of New-Hampſhire, though in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing in numbers, had not the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of an equal repreſentation. The aim of moſt of thoſe gentlemen, who received their appointments from abroad, was rather to pleaſe their maſters, and ſecure the emoluments of their offices, than to extend benefits to the people, or condeſcend to their prejudices. They did not feel thier dependence on them, as the ſource of power; nor their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſponſibility to them for its exerciſe. And,

            <p>THE genius, as well as the intereſt of the new Governor, led him to cultivate the good will of the people.<note place="margin">1767.</note> He was grandſon, by his mother, to the late agent John Rindge, who had been inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental of eſtabliſhing the boundaries of the Province, and had advanced a large ſum for that purpoſe. His family, who had long complained of ingratitude and neglect, were now amply gratified, not only by the advancement of the new Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor, but by his recommending ſeveral other gentlemen, who were connected with it, to fill vacant ſeats at the Council board, and other offices of government.

Several gentlemen of other reſpectable fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, who had been treated with neglect, in the preceding adminiſtration, were alſo taken into favor; and a ſpirit of concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, among thoſe who had formerly been at variance, ſeemed to mark the beginning of this adminiſtration with fair omens of peace and ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>Being in the prime of life, active and enterpriſing in his diſpoſition, polite and eaſy in his addreſs, and placed in the chair by the ſame miniſter who had procured the repeal of the ſtamp-act, to which event his own agency had contributed; Mr. Wentworth enjoyed a great ſhare of pop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ular favor; which was much heightened when his conduct was viewed in contraſt with that of ſome other Governors in the neighbouring Provinces. Though bred a merchant, he had a taſte for agriculture, and en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>red vigorouſly into the ſpirit of cultivation. He frequently traverſed the foreſts; explored the ground for new roads; and began a plantation for himſelf in the townſhip of Wolfborough, on which he expended large ſums, and built an elegant houſe. His example was influential on other landholders, who alſo applied them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in earneſt to cultivate the wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>

               <pb n="346" facs="unknown:023166_0345_0FBC8336B45A5418"/>The improvement of the country at this time occupied the minds of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of New-Hampſhire, and took off their attention, in a great meaſure, from the view of thoſe political difficulties, which were occaſioned by a new act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, laying duties on paper, glaſs, paint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers' colors, and tea; and the eſtabliſhment of a board of Commiſſioners for collecting the American revenue. In the other Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, particularly in Maſſachuſetts, theſe duties had become a ſubject of altercation and ſerious alarm, being grounded on the right which the Parliament had aſſumed of
<q>binding America in all caſes whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</q>
The only remedy was to be found in frugality, non-importation, and domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic manufactures. Theſe things were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended, and, in ſome meaſure, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with; and by means of theſe exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the revenue fell ſhort of the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine expectations which its advocates had formed.</p>
            <p>The popularity of the Governor of New-Hampſhire, and the influence of his nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous friends and connexions, who were of the principal families and the richeſt merchants in the Province, prevented the adoption of a non-importation agreement

A plan of the ſame kind was then (1770) formed; and the union of ſo many Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, in this meaſure, cauſed the manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers in Great-Britain to experience diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of the ſame nature with thoſe occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the ſtamp-act; and to exert their influence for a repeal of the new rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enue law, which was in part effected. All the duties, excepting that on tea, were taken off. This relaxation, on the other ſide of the Atlantic, produced a relaxation here. The miniſtry in Great-Britain was frequently changed; and no uniform ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem either of coercion or lenity was adopted. The oppoſition on this ſide languiſhed for want of unanimity. The more candid among us were willing to ſuppoſe that Britain would never lay any more duties; and there was ſome foundation for this ſuppoſition, as far as letters from miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of ſtate, and ſpeeches from provincial Governors might be depended on. The
<pb n="348" facs="unknown:023166_0347_0FBC833B36E004F8"/>
tax on <hi>tea</hi> was reſerved as a latent ſpark to rekindle the controverſy.</p>
            <p>When the Governor, at his firſt meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Aſſembly, according to the cuſtom on ſuch occaſions, recommended to them the eſtabliſhment of an 'adequate, honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and permanent ſalary,<note place="margin">Journal of Aſſembly.</note>' they made ſome heſitation, on account of a report, that the ſalaries of the American Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors were to be paid out of the revenue. On being aſſured, that if ſuch a general eſtabliſhment ſhould take place, it would be ſo guarded as to prevent his receiving any reward from the Aſſembly; they fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a vote, granting ſeven hundred pounds per annum during his adminiſtration (dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars being then fixed at ſix ſhillings.<note place="margin">Sept. 30.</note>) The fund appropriated to the ſalary was the exciſe, and in caſe of its inſufficiency, oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er proviſion was made. But the vote was limited with an exception,
<q>unleſs provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhall be made by Parliament.</q>
When the queſtion was put, the Houſe was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly divided, and the Speaker, Peter Gilman, turned it againſt a permanent ſalary. It was therefore voted from year to year, and generally amounted to ſeven hundred pounds; beſides which an allowance was made for houſe-rent, from ſixty or ſeventy to one hundred pounds.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="349" facs="unknown:023166_0348_0FBC833CEB014318"/>Among the improvements which, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this adminiſtration, were made in the Province, one of the moſt conſpicuous, was the eſtabliſhment of a ſeminary of lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rature. It was founded on a projection of Doctor Eleazer Wheelock, of Lebanon in Connecticut, for the removal of his Indian charity ſchool.</p>
            <p>The firſt deſign of a ſchool of this kind was conceived by Mr. John Sergeant, Miſſionary to the Indians at Stockbridge.<note place="margin">Hopkins's memoirs of the Houſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonnock Indians, 1736.</note> A rambling mode of life, and a total want of letters, were ever unfriendly to the prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agation of religious knowledge among the ſavages of America. That worthy miſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary, intent on the buſineſs of his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, and having obſerved the progreſs made by ſome of the younger Indians, who reſided in the Engliſh families, in reading and other improvements, conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the benevolent idea of changing their whole habit of thinking and acting; and raiſing them from their native indolence to a ſtate of civilization; and at the ſame time, by introducing the Engliſh language, inſtead of their own barren dialect, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtil into their minds the principles of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality and religion.</p>
            <p>To accompliſh this deſign, he procured benefactions from many well diſpoſed perſons both here and in England; and
<pb n="350" facs="unknown:023166_0349_0FBC833F9838AB18"/>
began a ſchool at Stockbridge; where the Indian youth were to be maintained, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the inſtruction of two maſters; one to overſee their ſtudies, and the other their field labor; whilſt a matron ſhould direct the female children in acquiring the arts of domeſtic life.<note place="margin">(1749)</note> Death put an end to the labors of this excellent man before his plan could be accompliſhed.</p>
            <p>This deſign was revived by Wheelock. Having made ſome experiments, he was encouraged to proceed, by the tractable diſpoſition of the Indian youths,<note place="margin">(1754)</note> and their proficiency in learning; but eſpecially, by the numerous benefactions, which he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the friends of religion and humanity.<note place="margin">Whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock's prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</note> Among which, a donation of Joſhua Moor, of Mansfield, being the larg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, in the infancy of the inſtitution, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined its name 'Moor's ſchool.'</p>
            <p>To increaſe the means of improvement, charitable contributions were ſolicited in different parts of America, in England, and in Scotland. The money collected in England, was put into the hands of a Board of Truſtees, of whom the Earl of Dartmouth was at the head; and that collected in Scotland was committed to the ſociety for promoting chriſtian know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="351" facs="unknown:023166_0350_0FBC834136AF1D70"/>As an improvement on the original deſign, a number of Engliſh youths were educated with the Indians, both in lite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary and agricultural exerciſes; that their example might invite the Indians to the love of thoſe employments, and abate the prejudice which they have univerſally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed, that it is beneath the dignity of man to delve in the earth.</p>
            <p>As the number of ſcholars increaſed, it became neceſſary to erect buildings, and extend cultivation. That part of the country in which the ſchool was firſt placed, being filled with inhabitants, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval was contemplated. When this intention was publicly known, offers were made by private and public perſons in ſeveral of the neighboring Colonies. The wary foreſight of the founder, aided by the advice of the Board of Truſtees, in England, led him to accept an invita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion made by the Governor, and other gentlemen of New-Hampſhire. The townſhip of Hanover, on the eaſtern bank of Connecticut river, was finally deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined on, as the moſt convenient ſituation for the ſchool; to which the Governor annexed a charter of incorporation for an univerſity,<note place="margin">Dec. 13.</note> which took the name of Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth College, from its benefactor, the
<pb n="352" facs="unknown:023166_0351_0FBC8342AFD31A60"/>
Earl of Dartmouth. Of this univerſity, Doctor Wheelock was declared the found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er and the Preſident; with power to nom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inate his ſucceſſor, in his laſt will. A Board of twelve Truſtees was conſtituted, with perpetual ſucceſſion; and the college was endowed with a large landed eſtate, conſiſting of one whole townſhip (Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daff) beſides many other tracts of land, in different ſituations, amounting in the whole, to forty-four thouſand acres. One valuable lot, of five hundred acres, in the townſhip of Hanover, given by the late Governor, Benning Wentworth, was fixed upon as the ſite of the ſchool and college. Beſides theſe donations of land, the amount of three hundred and forty pounds ſterling, was ſubſcribed, to be paid in labor, proviſions, and materials for building. With theſe advantages, and the proſpect of a rapidly increaſing neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood, in a fertile ſoil, on both ſides of Connecticut river, Doctor Wheelock removed his family and ſchool into the wilderneſs.<note place="margin">1770.</note> At firſt, their accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ſimilar to thoſe of other ſettlers,<note place="margin">September.</note> on new lands. They built huts of green logs, and lived in them, till a proper edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice could be erected. The number of ſcholars, at this time, was twenty-four;
<pb n="353" facs="unknown:023166_0352_0FBC834505CBB808"/>
of which eighteen were whites, and the reſt Indians.</p>
            <p>Experience had taught Doctor Whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, that his Indian youths, however well educated, were not to be depended on for inſtructors of their countrymen.<note place="margin">Narrative No. 5. p. 20, 21.</note> Of forty who had been under his care, twenty had returned to the vices of ſavage life; and ſome whom he eſteemed
<q>ſubjects of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace, had not kept their garments unſpotted.</q>
It was, therefore, in his new, neceſſary that a greater proportion of Engliſh youths ſhould be educated, to ſerve as miſſionaries, and overſee the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Indian teachers. This was given as the grand reaſon, for uniting the college with the Indian ſchool, and placing it under the ſame government; though the appropriations were diſtinctly preſerved. That the general concerns of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might be better regulated, and the intruſion of vicious perſons within the purlieus of the college prevented; a diſtrict of three miles ſquare was put un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its juriſdiction, and the Preſident was inveſted with the office of a magiſtrate. In 1771, a commencement was held, and the firſt degrees were conferred, on four
<pb n="354" facs="unknown:023166_0353_0FBC83482890D3A0"/>
ſtudents; one of whom was John Whee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lock, the ſon and ſucceſſor of the founder.</p>
            <p>Another improvement was made about the ſame time, by dividing the Province into counties. This had been long ſought, but could not be obtained. The incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience to which the people in the weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern parts of the Province were ſubject, by reaſon of their diſtance from Portſmouth, where all the Courts were held, was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely burdenſome; whilſt the conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and emoluments of office were enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by gentlemen in that vicinity. Some attempts to divide the Province had been made in the former adminiſtration; but without effect. The rapid increaſe of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants for ſeveral years, made a diviſion ſo neceſſary, that it had become one of the principal ſubjects of debate, in the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, from the time of the Governor's arrival. Several ſeſſions paſſed before all points could be adjuſted. The number of counties, and the lines of diviſion, were not eaſily agreed to, and a punctilio of prerogative about the erecting of Courts, made ſome difficulty; but it was finally determined, that the number of counties ſhould be five; and the Courts were eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed by an act of the whole legiſlature. It was paſſed with a clauſe, ſuſpending its
<pb n="355" facs="unknown:023166_0354_0FBC834972616E30"/>
operation,<note place="margin">1771.</note> till the King's pleaſure ſhould be known. The royal approbation being obtained, it took effect in 1771. The five counties were named by the Governor, after ſome of his friends in England; Rockingham, Strafford, Hillſborough, Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, and Grafton. The counties of Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford and Grafton being much leſs popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous, than the others, were to remain an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed to the county of Rockingham, till the Governor, by advice of Council, ſhould declare them competent to the exerciſe of their reſpective juriſdictions; which was done in 1773.</p>
            <p>The year 1771 was alſo diſtinguiſhed by the abolition of paper currency. Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and gold had been gradually introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the paper had for ſeveral years been called in by taxes. The time limited for its exiſtence being now come, it total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſappeared.</p>
            <p>The death of the late Governor produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed conſequences which materially affected his ſucceſſor.<note place="margin">Oct. 14<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1770. Ae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tat 75.</note> This family had been for many years of the firſt rank in the Prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ince, and ſome of its members and connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions had held the principal offices. In ſuch a caſe, domeſtic union may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as neceſſary to preſerve public hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or. The late Governor, though ſuperſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="356" facs="unknown:023166_0355_0FBC834B008B9660"/>
had been treated with every mark of reſpect; and having no children, it was expected that his ſucceſſor would be his principal heir. A later will, made in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of his young widow, and unknown till after his death, cauſed a ſudden diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment; which, if it had evaporated in private reflections only, might have paſſed among the infirmities incident to humanity, and with them might have been conſigned to oblivion; for it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath the dignity of hiſtory, to record the altercations of families, unleſs they are connected with public tranſactions, or events.</p>
            <p>Antiquated claims upon the late Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's eſtate were revived; and law-ſuits were commenced, which probably would not have been agitated, if the expected diſpoſition had been made. But the moſt alarming effect of this unhappy diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was a queſtion, which the Governor moved in Council,
<q>whether the reſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of five hundred acres, in ſeveral townſhips,<note place="margin">March 19.</note> made by the late Governor, Benning Wentworth,<note place="margin">

                     </gap>
                  </note> in the charter grants, conveyed the title to him?</q>
The Council determined this queſtion in the negative. The Governor then aſked, whether they would adviſe him to grant
<pb n="357" facs="unknown:023166_0356_0FBC834C8FFE4CA0"/>
the ſaid tracts, to ſuch of his Majeſty's ſubjects, as ſhould ſettle and cultivate the ſame? To this they gave their aſſent. Seven of the Counſellors preſent on this occaſion were the Governor's relations. The eighth was Peter Livius, a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of foreign extraction, who entered his diſſent. He had for ſeveral years ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as a Juſtice of the Common Pleas; but on the diviſion of the Province into coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, it was neceſſary to iſſue new commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions. Finding himſelf overlooked in the appointment of officers, and his private affairs calling him abroad, he ſailed for England, and there exhibited to the Lords of Trade,<note place="margin">1772.</note> articles of complaint againſt the Governor and his Council.<note place="margin">July 9.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt was, that the Governor and Council, without any legal proceſs,<note place="margin">Printed compl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>n.</note> or the intervention of a jury, had deprived the grantees under the Crown of their lands, on ſuggeſtion only that the conditions had not been fulfilled.</p>
            <p>The ſecond was, that the duty paid by foreign ſhipping, commonly called pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der money, had not been accounted for, ſince the year 1741; and that the Council had refuſed to join with the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives in an inquiry into this matter in the year 1768.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="358" facs="unknown:023166_0357_0FBC83515BE78630"/>The third was, that the Governor had moved in Council, that the lands reſerved to the late Governor, in the charters of townſhips, ſhould be regranted to himſelf, through the medium of another perſon; and that the proteſt of the complainant, againſt the legality of this proceeding, was rejected.</p>
            <p>The fourth was, that in conſequence of the oppoſition, which he was in duty bound thus to make, he had been injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly treated, and had received perſonal abuſe from the Governor.</p>
            <p>The fifth was, that pending an action in the Common Pleas, brought by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, though in other names, the Judges had ſeveral times been changed, till a queſtion on a point of law was determined in favor of the Governor.</p>
            <p>The ſixth article ſtated, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainant had expected to prove ſeveral of the above facts, by referring to copies of the Council records in their Lordſhip's office; but was ſurpriſed to find that the Governor had diſobeyed his inſtructions in not ſending them.</p>
            <p>The memorial concluded with a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral charge or partiality ariſing from the family connexions of the Governor and Council.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="359" facs="unknown:023166_0358_0FBC8353311A4448"/>Copies of this memorial were ſent to the Governor and Council, who ſeparately prepared and returned diſtinct anſwers to the ſeveral articles of complaint.<note place="margin">MS copies.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To the firſt, it was ſaid, that the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

               </gap>umption of grants forfeited by non-com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the conditions of ſettlement was ſupported by the opinion of the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torney and Solicitor General, given in 1752; that the invariable uſage in theſe caſes, had been to iſſue notice to delinquent proprietors, that they ſhould appear on a ſet day, and ſhew cauſe why their ſhares ſhould not be forfeited and regranted; that their allegations had been always treated with proper reſpect, and that no complaint of injuſtice had been made by any perſons whoſe grants had been thus reſumed.</p>
            <p>To the ſecond it was anſwered, that the amount of powder-money, during the former adminiſtration, though long neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, had been lately recovered; and that ſince 1768, it had been regularly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for. The reaſon for the non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concurrence of the Council, with the vote for inquiring into this matter, was their reſpect to the royal prerogative, conceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the Houſe had no concern with the matter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="360" facs="unknown:023166_0359_0FBC8354DDC6F0A8"/>To the third article, it was ſaid, that the late Governor, conſcious of the inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiency of his title, had ſolicited his ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor for grants of theſe reſervations, which he had declined giving, unleſs a mandamus from the King could be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured; that this uncertainty had prevented his alienating them; that in conſequence, they were uncultivated and forfeited; that ſome of theſe lands had been regranted to other perſons; but that the preſent Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor had no intereſt directly or indirectly in them. The Council denied, that the Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor had ever propoſed the granting of theſe lands to himſelf, through another perſon. They alſo denied that the diſſent of the memorialiſt had been refuſed.</p>
            <p>The charge of perſonal abuſe, in the fourth article, was contradicted and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted; but it was conceded, that the Governor had told him that his reaſons of diſſent were not founded in truth.</p>
            <p>In anſwer to the fifth article, it was acknowledged, that the action was brought for the Governor's benefit; but that any unfair means were uſed to influence the Court was denied. This denial was cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roborated by the depoſitions of the Judges themſelves, and of the Attorneys who were concerned in the ſuit. It was alſo proved
<pb n="361" facs="unknown:023166_0360_0FBC8356337C86D8"/>
that the judgment of the Court on the queſtion of law, was of no moment, being reverſed by the Superior Court, before which the cauſe was carried by appeal.</p>
            <p>To the ſixth article, it was anſwered, that the Governor had directed the Secre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary to furniſh him with copies of all the public tranſactions which had uſually been ſent to England, and that he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly tranſmitted them. But it appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the affidavit of the Secretary, that in June 1760, the late Governor had or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him not to tranſcribe the minutes of the Council, when ſitting without the Aſſembly, unleſs ſpecially directed; and ſince that time it had been uſual to ſend the journal of the Council when ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting as a Houſe of Aſſembly, and not as a Council of State.</p>
            <p>In fine, the Council denied that they had ever acted, in their public capacity, from any private or family intereſt; but aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted, that they had frequently given their judgment directly againſt it; and they concluded with very ſevere reflections on the complainant.</p>
            <p>With theſe anſwers,<note place="margin">1773.</note> were tranſmitted a great number of depoſitions,<note place="margin">MS copies.</note> from perſons of all ranks and profeſſions, teſtifying in favor of the Governor, Theſe being laid

            <p>'That by the law of England, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>nds were granted, upon condition, the breach of that condition muſt be found by a jury under a commiſſion from the Court of Chancery; but that no ſuch Court exiſted in New-Hampſhire; and though the general rule was that the law of England extended to the Colonies, yet it muſt be underſtood to mean, ſuch part of the law as is adapted to the ſtate and conſtitution of them. That though the Governor had reſumed and regranted lands, yet there was no evidence that ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptions had been made without proof or public notoriety, that the conditions of former grants had not been complied with; and that no complaint had been made by any perſon ſuppoſed to be injured. That it had not been proved that reſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions had been made without notice to the proprietors; and it had not even been ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted, in caſes where time had been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, that grants were reſumed before the expiration of it. That the lands granted to the late Governor were granted in the name of the King, which was ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient
<pb n="364" facs="unknown:023166_0363_0FBC835DB7174D50"/>
to convey a title; and that the Council was miſtaken in thinking otherwiſe. That the Governor, by their advice, did reſume and regrant ſeveral tracts of land which had been granted to the late Governor; but it had not been proved that the ſaid lands were regranted in truſt for himſelf; and in many inſtances ſuch lands were regranted to different inhabitants for their own uſe and benefit; and that the late Governor's widow had not complained of any injury, by ſuch reſumption. That it appeared to have been the conſtant practice when any ſtanding Juſtice of a Court was intereſted in a ſuit, for a ſpecial Juſtice to be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed; that other cauſes were depending at the ſame Inferior Court of Common Pleas, in which the ſtanding Juſtices were intereſted, and there was no proof that ſpecial Juſtices were appointed on account of that particular cauſe in which the Gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enor was concerned; but that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was ſolicited in the common form; and that the defendant himſelf had teſtified that he had no objection to the commiſſion or to the ſpecial Juſtices. With reſpect to the tranſmiſſion of the records of Council, it was their opinion that it might be proper to revive that practice, as it had been conducted previouſly to the

               </gap>ubmitted their judgment that there
<q>was no foundation for any cenſure upon the ſaid Governor, for any of the charges contained in the complaint, and that the general conduct of his adminiſtration had tended greatly to the peace and proſperity of the ſaid Province.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This report was approved by the King in Council,<note place="margin">Oct<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>In this controverſy Mr. Livius met with great ſupport, from the intereſt of thoſe who wiſhed to diſplace the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor; and they became ſo deeply engaged to him, as to procure for him an appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be the Chief Juſtice of New-Hampſhire; but, upon more mature conſideration, this was thought too likely to produce diſcord and confuſion, and he obtained an appointment to a more lucra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive office in the Province of Quebec.</p>
            <p>When the final iſſue of the complaint was known in New-Hampſhire, a general ſatisfaction appeared among the people. At the next ſeſſion of the Aſſembly, the Houſe of Repreſentatives preſented to the
<pb n="366" facs="unknown:023166_0365_0FBC8360B05E3F78"/>
Governor, an adddreſs of congratulation, in the name of their conſtituents; and the citizens of Portſmouth gave a ſplendid ball, to which the Governor and both Houſes of Aſſembly were invited.</p>
            <p>Hitherto the Governor had preſerved his popularity; and the people, in general, were ſatisfied with his adminiſtration. But, the obligation which lay on him to ſupport the claims of Britain, and aid the plans of her miniſtry, rendered his ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion extremely delicate, and his populari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty very precarious. The controverſy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Britain and the Colonies was draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a criſis. By the reſervation of the duty on tea, the Parliament inſiſted on it as their right, to tax their American bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren without their conſent; and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mericans, by withholding the importation of tea from Britain, made uſe of the only peaceable mode, in their power, effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to oppoſe that claim. The revenue failed, and the warehouſes of the Eaſt India company were filled with an unſaleable commodity. The miniſtry and the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, thus ſeverely diſappointed, formed a plan, by which it was expected, that the one would enforce their claim, and the other ſecure their traffic.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="367" facs="unknown:023166_0366_0FBC83645C96B1F0"/>It was therefore enacted in Parliament, that the duty on the exportation of tea, from Britain, ſhould be taken off; and the Eaſt India company be enabled to ſend tea, on their own account, to America, ſubject to a duty only of three pence on the pound; by which means it would come to us, cheaper than before, or than it could be procured by illicit trade.</p>
            <p>This meaſure cauſed a general alarm, through the Colonies; and united the intereſt of the merchants, with the views of the politicians, and the general ſenſe of liberty in the people. The trading towns ſet the example, which the others follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of paſſing reſolves, not to permit tea, freighted by the Eaſt India company, to be landed or ſold. Theſe reſolutions were effectual. In ſome places the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignees were obliged to relinquiſh their appointments, and the tea was returned unladen. In other places it was depoſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ſtores, till it could be reſhipped. In Boſton, where the obſtinacy of Governor Hutchinſon drove the people to deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it was deſtroyed. In New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ſhire, the prudence of Governor Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, the vigilance of the magiſtrates and the firmneſs of the people were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined, and the hateful commodity wa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

were regarded as ſuffering in the common cauſe. But, to guard ourſelves effectual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly againſt the gathering ſtorm, a <hi>union of the Colonies</hi> was thought abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; and recourſe was had to the ſame meaſure which had formerly been tried in caſes of common danger, to hold a CONGRESS of delegates from each Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ony.</p>
            <p>The enemies of America have uniformly cenſured this meaſure as unprecedented, illegal and dangerous. That it was dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous to the deſigns of the Britiſh ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration, is admitted; but for that reaſon, it was to us the means of ſafety. Though it was not ſupported by any written law, yet it was evidently founded on ſelf preſervation, the firſt law of nature. But that it was unprecedented, is a very great miſtake. From the middle of the preceding century, the united Colonies of New-England, held annual, or ſemiannu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al meetings of Commiſſioners, on their common concerns, for above forty years.

            <p>The troops in Boſton wanted barracks, to ſecure them againſt the approaching winter. The artificers of the town, were, by the popular voice, reſtrained from working in the ſervice of government. General Gage was therefore obliged to ſend for aſſiſtance to the neighboring Governors, and, among others, to Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Wentworth. Inſtead of convening his Council for their advice, or iſſuing a proclamation, inviting help and promiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reward, he privately employed a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to hire carpenters to go to Boſton. It was impoſſible that the ſecret ſhould be kept, and when it was known, his beſt

friends reprobated his conduct. The Committee of Portſmouth, at the head of which, was his uncle, Hunking Went<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worth, bore their public teſtimony againſt it; and cenſured him, not by name, but by implication, as 'an enemy to the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,' and the men whom he had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, as 'unworthy of ſociety.' The agent in this ſecret buſineſs, was brought on his knees before the committee of Rocheſter, and made an humble acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edgment. This prudent ſtep of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, diſarmed the popular rage, and prevented any injury to his perſon or property.</p>

Not long after this advice was made public, a contingency preſented it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, in which the people of New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire gave an example of that ſpirit, by which the whole country was animated.</p>

A fair and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did repreſentation of our grievances could not be received, in the Court of Britain.

When two independent nations are in ſuch a ſtate, they generally find among their friends and allies, ſome mediating power, to bring them to terms and prevent a rup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.

            <p>The firſt ſhips, which arrived in the ſpring, brought us news that the petition of Congreſs was graciouſly received by the King; and that the merchants of England were petitioning in our favor.

Theſe tidings threw us into diſtreſs. A war ſeemed inevitable; and a gloom overſpread the whole country.

               </gap>n receiving this news, was in the higheſt degree abſurd and inconſiſtent. He had been blamed in Parliament for his inactiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. He had <hi>friends</hi> in Boſton, who con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly aſſured him, that the people in the country would not dare to face his troops. He had been informed of a magazine of proviſions and ſtores, at Concord, laid up
<pb n="382" facs="unknown:023166_0381_0FBC83840639F6B0"/>
by the Provincial Congreſs, in caſe of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity. With the news of the concilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory propoſition, he received orders to make an experiment of its ſucceſs. On the eighteenth day of April,<note place="margin">April 18</note> he iſſued writs for calling a general Aſſembly, to comply with the propoſed terms of reconciliation; and in the night following, he privately diſpatched a body of his troops, to deſtroy the magazine at Concord; and to ſeize ſome of the leaders of oppoſition, who had retired from the town. He was induced to believe, that if between the iſſuing of his writs, and the meeting of the Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, he could ſtrike a bold ſtroke; it would ſo intimidate the people, and unfit them for defence, that they would eaſily comply with the terms propoſed. But he totally miſtook the genius of the people of New-England. Nor were his deſigns carried on ſo ſecretly as he imagined. The popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar leaders were ſeaſonably appriſed of their danger, and kept themſelves out of his reach. The country was alarmed, by expreſſes ſent off in the night, before he had taken the precaution to ſhut the ave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues of the town.

            <p>On the alarm of this act of hoſtility, the people of New-Hampſhire, and of the other Colonies, took arms, and flew to the aſſiſtance of their brethren.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding this ill-adviſed and unſucceſsful attempt of Gage, Governor Wentworth had very ſanguine hopes of the good effect of the 'conciliatory propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition;' and determined, as he ſaid,
<q>to plant the root of peace in New-Hampſhire.</q> He ſummoned a new Aſſembly; and in his ſpeech, entreated them, as

The Houſe deſired a ſhort receſs, that they
<pb n="384" facs="unknown:023166_0383_0FBC84EA05CA6430"/>
might adviſe with their conſtituents on ſo momentous a queſtion; and the Governor reluctantly conſented to adjourn them to the twelfth day of June.</p>
            <p>In the mean time, the officers and men of the Scarborough began to diſmantle the fort; they alſo ſtopped two veſſels la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with proviſions, which were coming into the harbor; and notwithſtanding the moſt preſſing remonſtrances of the inhabitants, and ſolicitation of the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, refuſed to releaſe them. Upon this, a body of armed men, went to a battery on Jerry's point, at Great Iſland, and took away eight cannon of twenty-four and thirty-two pound ſhot,<note place="margin">May 26.</note> which they brought up to Portſmouth; and whilſt they were engaged in this work, the Canſeau ſloop convoyed the two proviſion veſſels to Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, for the ſupply of the fleet and army.</p>
            <p>A new convention was at this time ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Exeter; in which the Province was more fully and equally repreſented, than it ever had been before.

               <note place="margin">1775.</note>WHEN the controverſy with Britain ſhewed ſymptoms of hoſtility, and the deſign of the Miniſtry and Parliament to provoke us to arms became apparent; the people of New-Hampſhire began ſeriouſly to meditate the defence of their country. It was uncertain in what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner the ſcene would open; for this and other reaſons no regular plan of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions could be formed. By the old mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia law, every male inhabitant, from ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen years old to ſixty, was obliged to be provided with a muſket and bayonet, knap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſack, cartridge-box, one pound of powder, twenty bullets and twelve flints. Every town was obliged to keep in readineſs one barrel of powder, two hundred pounds of lead and three hundred flints, for every ſixty men; beſide a quantity of arms and ammunition for the ſupply of ſuch as were not able to provide themſelves with the
<pb n="389" facs="unknown:023166_0388_0FBC84F4F32FBAB0"/>
neceſſary articles. Even thoſe perſons who were exempted from appearing at the common military trainings, were obliged to keep the ſame arms and ammunition. In a time of peace, theſe requiſitions were neglected, and the people in general were not completely furniſhed, nor the towns ſupplied according to law. The care which the Governor had taken to appoint officers of militia and review the regiments, for ſome years before, had awakened their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the duties of the parade; which were performed with renewed ardor, after the provincial convention had recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the learning of military exerciſes and manoeuvres. Voluntary aſſociations were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

drama of war. The alarm was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately communicated from town to town through the whole country, and volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers flocked from all parts; till a body of ten thouſand men aſſembled in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood of Boſton, completely inveſted it on the land ſide, and cut off all commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication with the country.</p>
            <p>On the firſt alarm, about twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men marched from the neareſt parts of New-Hampſhire, to join their brethren, who had aſſembled in arms about Boſton. Of theſe, ſome returned; others formed themſelves into two regiments, under the authority of the Maſſachuſetts Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.<note place="margin">May 17.</note> As ſoon as the Provincial Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of New-Hampſhire met, they vot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to raiſe two thouſand men, to be formed into three regiments; thoſe which were already there to be accounted as two, and another to be inliſted immediately. Theſe men engaged to ſerve till the laſt day of December, unleſs ſooner diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

            <p>It had been a common ſentiment among the Britiſh troops, that the Americans would not dare to fight with them. This battle effectually convinced them of their miſtake. They found that fighting with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s was a ſerious thing; and the loſs which they ſuſtained in this battle, evidently had an influence on their ſubſequent opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the Scarborough frigate remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the harbour of Piſcataqua, frequent bickerings happened between her crew and the inhabitants. Captain Berkeley <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

boats belonging to the river from going out to catch fiſh. This conduct was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the orders which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to execute the reſtraining act. In return, his boats were not permitted to fetch proviſions from the town; and one of them was fired upon in the night, by ſome of the guards ſtationed on the ſhore. A compromiſe, at length, was made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween him and the committee of the town; open boats were permitted to paſs, to catch fiſh for the inhabitants; and his boats were allowed to take freſh proviſions for the uſe of the ſhip. This agreement ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted but a ſhort time, and finally all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe was cut off.</p>

One of theſe was called Fort Waſhington, and the other Fort Sullivan. The cannon which had been ſaved from the old fort and battery were mounted here, and the town was thought to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure from being ſurpriſed by ſhips of war.</p>

<q>to take un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration, all matters in which the welfare of the Province, in the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of their rights, is concerned; and to take the utmoſt care, that the public ſuſtain no damage.<note n="*" place="bottom">'Ne quid detrimenti reſpublica c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Particular inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were given to them, from time to time, as occaſion required. They were conſidered as the ſupreme executive; and during the receſs of the convention, their orders and recommendations had the ſame effect as the acts and reſolves of that whole body.</p>
            <p>By an order of the convention, the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Secretary, Theodore Atkinſon, Eſq. delivered up the Province records, to a committee which was ſent to receive them,
<pb n="396" facs="unknown:023166_0395_0FBC850401C8D920"/>
and Ebenezer Thompſon, Eſq. was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his place. The records of deeds, and of the probate office, for the county of Rockingham, were alſo remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Exeter, as a place of greater ſafety than Portſmouth. The former Treaſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, George Jaffrey, Eſq. was applied to for the public money in his hands, which, to the amount of one thouſand five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixteen pounds four ſhillings and eight pence, he delivered; and Nicholas Gilman, Eſq. was appointed Treaſurer in his room.</p>
            <p>During this year, three emiſſions of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per bills were made. The firſt, of ten thouſand and fifty pounds; the ſecond, of ten thouſand pounds; and the third, of twenty thouſand pounds. For the amount of thoſe ſums, the Treaſurer gave his ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligation in ſmall notes, which paſſed for a time, as current money, equal in value to ſilver and gold. But as emiſſions were multiplied, as the redemption of the bills was put off to diſtant periods, and the bills themſelves were counterfeited, it was impoſſible for them long to hold their value.</p>
            <p>Beſide the three regiments which made part of the American army at Cambridge,
<pb n="397" facs="unknown:023166_0396_0FBC85074FB93138"/>
a company of artillery was raiſed to do duty at the forts. A company of rangers was poſted on Connecticut river; and two companies more were appointed, to be ready to march wherever the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of ſafety ſhould direct. The whole militia was divided into twelve regiments; the field officers were appointed by the convention, and the inferior officers were choſen by the companies. Out of the militia were inſiſted four regiments of minute-men, ſo called, becauſe they were to be ready at a minute's warning. They were conſtantly trained to military duty, and when called to ſervice, were allowed the ſame pay as the regiments in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental army. In the ſucceeding winter, when the Connecticut forces had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn from the camp, becauſe their time of ſervice was expired, ſixteen companies of the New-Hampſhire militia, of ſixty-one men each, ſupplied their place, till the Britiſh troops evacuated Boſton.</p>
            <p>The convention having been appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for ſix months only; before the expira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that time, applied to the general Congreſs for their advice, reſpecting ſome mode of government for the future.

On receiving this advice, the convention took into their conſideration the mode in which a full and free repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation ſhould be called;<note place="margin">Nov. 14.</note> and finally agreed, that each elector ſhould poſſeſs a real eſtate of twenty pounds value, and every candidate for election, one of three hundred pounds; that every town, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of one hundred families, ſhould ſend one Repreſentative, and one more for every hundred families; and that thoſe towns which contained a leſs number than one hundred ſhould be claſſed.

            <p>This convention was compoſed chiefly of men who knew nothing of the theory of government, and had never before been concerned in public buſineſs. In the ſhort term of ſix months, they acquired ſo much knowledge by experience, as to be convinced, that it was improper for a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative Aſſembly to conſiſt of one Houſe only. As ſoon as the new convention came together, they drew up a temporary form of government; and,<note place="margin">Dec. 21.</note> agreeably to the truſt repoſed in them by their conſtit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uents,
<pb n="400" facs="unknown:023166_0399_0FBC850C315ABC30"/>
having aſſumed the name and au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of a Houſe of Repreſentatives,<note place="margin">1776.</note> they proceeded to chooſe twelve perſons,<note place="margin">Jan. 5.</note> to be a diſtinct branch of the legiſlature, by the name of a Council. Of theſe, five were choſen from the county of Rocking<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, two from Strafford, two from Hillſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, two from Cheſhire and one from Grafton. Theſe were empowered to elect their own Preſident, and any ſeven of them were to be a quorum. It was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained, that no act or reſolve ſhould be valid, unleſs paſſed by both branches of the legiſlature; that all money bills ſhould originate in the Houſe of Repreſentatives; that neither Houſe ſhould adjourn for more than two days, without the conſent of the other; that a Secretary, and all oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er public officers of the Colony, and of each County, for the current year, all general and field officers of militia, and all officers of the marching regiments, ſhould be appointed by the two Houſes; all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate militia officers by their reſpective companies; that the preſent Aſſembly ſhould ſubſiſt one year, and if the diſpute with Britain ſhould continue longer, and the general Congreſs ſhould give no di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections to the contrary, that precepts ſhould be iſſued annually to the ſeveral

So great was the confidence of the people in this gentleman, that they ſcrupled not to inveſt him, at the ſame time, with the higheſt offices, legiſlative, executive, and judicial; in which he was continued by annual elections during the whole war.</p>
            <p>This conſtitution was prefaced with ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral reaſons for adopting government, viz.
<pb n="402" facs="unknown:023166_0401_0FBC8511B93F1338"/>
That the Britiſh Parliament had, by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny grievous and oppreſſive acts, deprived us of our native rights; to enforce obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of our native rights; to enforce obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to which acts, the miniſtry of that kingdom had ſent a powerful fleet and army into this country, and had wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and cruelly abuſed their power, in deſtroying our lives and property; that the ſudden and abrupt departure of our late Governor, had left us deſtitute of le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlation; that no judicial Courts were open to puniſh offenders; and that the continental Congreſs had recommended the adoption of a form of government. Upon theſe grounds the convention made a declaration in theſe words,

for reconciliation to a power which ſtill claimed the right

and which held out to us unconditional ſubmiſſion, as the only terms on which we were to expect even a pardon. Subjection to a Prince who had thrown us out of his protection; who had ruined our commerce, deſtroyed our cities and ſpilled our blood; and who would not govern us at all, without the interpoſition of a legiſlative body, in whoſe election we had no voice, was an idea too abſurd to be any longer entertained.

               <pb n="406" facs="unknown:023166_0405_0FBC85183795B898"/>It is amuſing to recollect, at this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of time, that one effect of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence was an averſion to every thing which bore the name and marks of royalty. Sign boards on which were painted the King's arms, or the crown and ſceptre, or the portraits of any branches of the royal family, were pulled down or defaced. Pictures and eſcutcheons of the ſame kind in private houſes were inverted or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed. The names of ſtreets, which had been called after a King or Queen were altered; and the half-pence, which bore the name of George III, were either refuſed in payment, or degraded to farthings. Theſe laſt have not yet recovered their va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue.</p>
            <p>The new Aſſembly began their adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration by eſtabliſhing Judicial Courts, on the ſame ſyſtem as before, excepting that the Court of Appeals, which had long been eſteemed a grievance, was aboliſhed, and all appeals to Great-Britain were prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Appeals from the Probate Courts, which formerly came before the Governor and Council, were transferred to the Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior Court, whoſe judgment was now made final. Encouragement was given to fit out armed veſſels, and a maritime Court was eſtabliſhed for the trial of captures by

ſea. A law was made to puniſh the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting of the paper bills of this and of the United States; and to make them
<q>a tender for any money due by deed or ſimple contract.</q>
After the declaration of independence the ſtyle of <hi>Colony</hi> was changed for that of the STATE of New-Hampſhire. A new law was enacted to regulate the militia. More paper bills were iſſued to pay the expenſes of the war; and proviſion was made for drawing in ſome of the bills by taxes. Doubts had ariſen, whether the former laws were in force; a ſpecial act was therefore paſſed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving and re-enacting all the laws which were in force, at the time when govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was aſſumed; as far as they were not repugnant to the new form, or to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence of the Colonies, or not actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally repealed.</p>

Powder mills were erected, and the manufacture of gunpowder was, after ſome time, eſtabliſhed; but notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all our exertions, foreign ſupplies were neceſſary.</p>
            <p>For the ſervice of this year, two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men were raiſed, and formed into three regiments, under the ſame command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as in the former year. Three hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men were poſted at the forts in the harbour. Supplies of fire arms and am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition were ſent to the weſtern parts of the State, and a regiment was raiſed in that quarter, under the command of Col. Timothy Bedel, to be ready to march in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to Canada.</p>
            <p>The three regiments went with the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my under General Waſhington to New-York; and thence were ordered up the Hudſon, and down the lakes into Canada, under the immediate command of Briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier General Sullivan. The deſign of this movement was to ſuccour and reinforce the army, which had been ſent, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding year, againſt Quebec; and which was now retreating before a ſuperior force, which had arrived from Britain, as early as the navigation of the St. Lawrence was opened. Our troops having met the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating army at the mouth of the Sorel, threw up ſome ſlight works round their

camp. General Thomas, who had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the army after the fall of the brave Montgomery, was dead of the ſmall-pox. Arnold was engaged in ſtripping the merchants of Montreal, under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of ſupplying the army; and Thomp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was taken priſoner in an unſucceſsful attack on the village of Trois Rivieres. The command therefore devolved on Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livan, who, finding a retreat neceſſary, conducted it with great prudence. At this time the American troops, and in particular the regiments of New-Hampſhire, had tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the infection of the ſmall-pox. The ſick were placed in batteaux, and with the cannon and ſtores, were drawn againſt the rapid current, by the ſtrength of men on ſhore, or wading in the water; and ſo cloſe was the purſuit of the enemy, that they could ſcarcely find time to kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle a fire to dreſs their victuals, or dry their clothes.

            <p>When the danger of an attack on Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conderoga for that ſeaſon, was paſſed, the remaining part of the New-Hampſhire troops marched by the way of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinks<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> into Pennſylvania.

            <p>By this time the inconvenience of maintaining an army,<note place="margin">1777.</note> by annual inliſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and temporary levies, was ſeverely felt, and generally reprobated; and the Congreſs, though ſlow in liſtening to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrances on this head, were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to adopt a more permanent eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment. In recruiting the army for the next year, the officers were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Congreſs, during the war; and the men inliſted either for that term, or

for three years. The commanders of the three regiments of New-Hampſhire, were the Colonels Joſeph Cilley, Nathan Hale and Alexander Scammell. Theſe regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were ſupplied with new French arms; and their rendezvous was at Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conderoga, under the immediate command of Brigadier General Poor. There they remained, till the approach of the Britiſh army under General Burgoyne,<note place="margin">July 6.</note> rendered it eligible to abandon that poſt. On the retreat, Col. Hale's battalion was order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to cover the rear of the invalids, by which means, he was ſeven miles behind the main body. The next morning he was attacked, by an advanced party of the enemy at Hubberton. In this engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Major Titcomb of the New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire troops, was wounded. Col. Hale, Captains Robertſon, Carr, and Norris, Adjutant Elliot, and two other officers were taken priſoners, with about one hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men. The main body of the army continued their retreat to Saratoga. On their way they had a ſkirmiſh with the enemy at Fort Anne, in which Captain Weare, ſon of the Preſident, was mortally wounded, and died at Albany.</p>

They ordered the militia officers, to take away arms, from all perſons, who ſcrupled or refuſed to aſſiſt, in defending the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; and appointed a day of faſting and prayer, which was obſerved with great ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity.</p>

In an arrangement of general officers, in the preceding year, a junior officer had been promoted, whilſt he was neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He had written on this ſubject to Congreſs, and his letters were laid on the table. He therefore quitted the army, and retired to his own eſtate.

Having proceeded about four miles, he met Greg retreating, and the main body of the enemy purſuing, within half a mile of his rear. When they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered Stark's column, they halted in an

advantageous poſition; and he drew up his men on an eminence in open view; but could not bring them to an engagement. He then marched back, about a mile, and encamped; leaving a few men to ſkirmiſh with them; who killed thirty of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my and two of the Indian chiefs. The next day was rainy. Stark kept his poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,<note place="margin">Aug. 15.</note> and ſent out parties to harraſs the enemy.

His whole force amounted to about ſixteen hundred. He ſent Col. Nichols, with two hundred and fifty men, to the rear of the enemy's left wing; and Col.

            <p>Juſt at this inſtant, he received intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that another body of the enemy was within two miles of him. This was a reinforcement for which Baum had ſent, when he firſt knew the force which he was to oppoſe. It was commanded by Col. Breyman. Happily Warner's regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from Mancheſter came up with them and ſtopped them. Stark rallied his men and renewed the action; it was warm and deſperate; he uſed, with ſucceſs, the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non which he had taken; and at ſunſet obliged the enemy to retreat.

<q>our people behaved with the greateſt ſpirit and bravery imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Had every man been an Alexander, or a Charles of Sweden, they could not have behaved better.</q>
He was ſenſible of the advantage of keeping on the flank of the enemy's main body; and therefore ſent for one thouſand men to replace thoſe whoſe time had expired; but intimated to the committee that he himſelf ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn with the brigade. They cordially thanked him

This argument prevailed with the men to march, and with Stark to remain.</p>
            <p>The priſoners taken in this battle were ſent to Boſton. The trophies were divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between New-Hampſhire and Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts. But Congreſs heard of this vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory by accident. Having waited ſome time in expectation of letters, and none arriving<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> inquiry was made why Stark
<pb n="419" facs="unknown:023166_0418_0FBC852F77C00C88"/>
had not written to Congreſs? He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that his correſpondence with them was cloſed, as they had not attended to his laſt letters. They took the hint; and though they had but a few days before reſolved, that the inſtructions which he had received were deſtructive of military ſubordination, and prejudicial to the common cauſe; yet they preſented their thanks to him, and to the officers and troops under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, and promoted him to the rank of a Brigadier General, in the army of the United States.</p>
            <p>This victory gave a ſevere check to the hopes of the enemy, and raiſed the ſpirits of the people after long depreſſion. It whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly changed the face of affairs in the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern department. Inſtead of diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and retreat, and the loſs of men by hard labor and ſickneſs; we now were convinced, not only that our militia could fight without being covered by intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; but that they were able, even with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out artillery, to cope with regular troops in their intrenchments. The ſucceſs thus gained was regarded as a good omen of farther advantages.
<q>Let us get them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the woods,</q>
was the language of the whole country. Burgoyne was daily put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting his army into a more hazardous ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation;
<pb n="420" facs="unknown:023166_0419_0FBC853100466770"/>
and we determined that no exertion ſhould be wanting on our part to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the ruin of his boaſted enterpriſe. The northern army was reinforced by the militia of all the neighbouring States. Brigadier Whipple marched with a great part of his brigade; beſides which, volun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teers in abundance from every part of New-Hampſhire flew to the army under General Gates. Two deſperate battles were fought, the one at Stillwater and the other at Saratoga; in both of which, the troops of New-Hampſhire had a large ſhare of the honor due to the American army. In the former action, two Lieuten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant Colonels, Adams and Colburne, and Lieutenant Thomas, were ſlain in the field; and ſeveral other brave officers were wounded, one of whom, Captain Bell, died in the hoſpital. In the latter, Lieut. Col. Conner and Lieut. McClary were killed, with a great number of their men; and Col. Scammel was wounded. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of theſe battles was the ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Burgoyne's army. This grand object being attained, the New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire regiments performed a march of forty miles, and forded the Mohawk river, below the falls, in the ſpace of four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hours. The deſign of this rapid
<pb n="421" facs="unknown:023166_0420_0FBC853298A84568"/>
movement was to check the progreſs of a detachment, commanded by the Britiſh General Clinton; who threatened Albany with the ſame deſtruction which he had ſpread in the country below; but on hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fate of Burgoyne, he returned quietly to New-York. The regiments then marched into Pennſylvania and paſſed the winter in huts at Valley-ſorge. Beſide thoſe officers ſlain at the northward, we ſuſtained a loſs in the death of Major Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Sherburne, Aid de Camp to General Sullivan, who was killed in a bold, but unſucceſsful action at Germantown.</p>
            <p>After the capture of Burgoyne's army, all danger of invaſion from Canada ceaſed;<note place="margin">1778.</note> and the theatre of the war was removed to the ſouthward. The troops of New-Hampſhire, being formed into a diſtinct brigade, partook of all the ſervices and ſufferings, to which their brethren were expoſed. In the battle of Monmouth, a part of them were cloſely engaged, under the conduct of Col. Cilley and Lieut. Col. Dearborn; and behaved with ſuch bravery as to merit the particular approbation of their illuſtrious General. They continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the main body, all that campaign, and were hutted, in the following winter, at Reading.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="422" facs="unknown:023166_0421_0FBC8534029F8A10"/>In the ſummer of 1778, when a French fleet appeared on our coaſt, to aid us in the conteſt with Britain; an invaſion of Rhode-Iſland, then poſſeſſed by the Britiſh, was projected, and General Sullivan had the command. Detachments of militia and volunteers, from Maſſachuſetts and New-Hampſhire, formed a part of his troops. But a violent ſtorm, having pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the co-operation of the French fleet, and driven them to ſea; the army, after a few ſkirmiſhes, was under the diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble neceſſity of quitting the iſland; and the retreat was conducted by Sullivan with the greateſt caution and prudence.</p>
            <p>When an expedition into the Indian country was determined on,<note place="margin">1779.</note> General Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livan was appointed to the command, and the New-Hampſhire brigade made a part of his force. His route was up the river Suſquehanna into the country of the Sene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kas; a tract imperfectly known, and into which no troops had ever penetrated. The order of his march was planned with great judgment, and executed with much regularity and perſeverance. In ſeveral engagements with the Savages, the troops of New-Hampſhire behaved with their uſual intrepidity. Capt. Cloyes and Lieut. McAulay were killed, and Major Titcomb
<pb n="423" facs="unknown:023166_0422_0FBC85358DFF4850"/>
was again badly wounded. The provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of the army falling ſhort, before the object of the expedition was completed, the troops generouſly agreed to ſubſiſt on ſuch as could be found in the Indian coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. After their return, they rejoined the main army, and paſſed a third winter in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The next year, a part of them remained in the State of New-York,<note place="margin">1781.</note> and another part marched to Virginia, and were preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent at the capture of the ſecond Britiſh army, under Earl Cornwallis.

            <head>CHAP. XXVI. Paper-money. Confiſcations. State Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. Controverſy with Vermont.</head>
            <p>THE war in which we became involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Britain, found us not deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titute of reſources, but unſkilled in the art of finance. Former wars had been maintained by a paper currency; which, though it depreciated in ſome meaſure, yet was finally redeemed by the reimburſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which we received from the Britiſh Treaſury. We had been alſo uſed to iſſue bills on loan, and receive landed property as ſecurity for its redemption. To the ſame mode we had recourſe on this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, without either of the foundations on which our former currencies had been ſupported. Bills of credit were emitted with no other fund for their redemption than taxation, and that deferred to diſtant periods. It was imagined that the juſtice of our cauſe, and the united ardor and patriotiſm of the people, would preſerve the value of theſe bills during the conteſt which we were very ſanguine would be ſhort; and in fact the circulation of them
<pb n="426" facs="unknown:023166_0425_0FBC853D01244C20"/>
for the firſt year was ſupported by no other means.<note place="margin">1776.</note> But being counterfeited, they began to depreciate, and then it was thought neceſſary to enact a law againſt forging them, and to make them a legal tender in all payments.<note place="margin">
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>ly 3.</note> In ſome of the States, theſe bills were made a tender for the intereſt, but not for the principal of former debts; but in New-Hampſhire, if the creditor ſhould refuſe them when of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in payment, the whole debt was cancelled. Had this law regarded future contracts only, every man would have known on what terms to make his en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagements; but to declare it legal to pay debts, already contracted, with money of an inferior value, was altogether unjuſt. It was not in human power to prevent a depreciation of the bills; and the enforcing of their currency accelerated the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their value. The fraudulent debtor took advantage of this law to cheat his creditor, under colour of juſtice; whilſt the creditor had no other refuge, than in ſome caſes privately to transfer the written obligation; and in other caſes to refuſe the tender, at the riſque indeed of loſing the debt; but in hope that juſtice would at ſome future time have its courſe. Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandmen, who lived remote from the ſcene
<pb n="427" facs="unknown:023166_0426_0FBC853E730182A8"/>
of hoſtilities, and who had the produce of the earth at their command, were able to keep their property good. Hawkers and monopoliſers, who crept from obſcurity and aſſumed the name of merchants, could even increaſe their ſubſtance in theſe peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous times. But thoſe perſons whoſe prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty was in other men's hands; or whoſe living depended on ſtated ſalaries; or whoſe honeſt minds could not deſcend to practiſe knavery, though eſtabliſhed by law, were doomed to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>To palliate theſe evils, at one time, a law was enacted againſt monopoly and extortion; and when found impracticable,<note place="margin">1777.</note> it was repealed. At other times, the prices of different articles were ſtated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſevere penalties; but ways were ſoon found to evade theſe eſtabliſhments; and when found ineffectual, the laws were repealed. It is not conſiſtent with the nature of commerce to bear ſuch reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and the laws increaſed the evils which they pretended to cure. At another time public ſales by auction were prohibit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, becauſe it was ſaid that they were the means of depreciating the currency; but in fact they ſerved only to demonſtrate its real value. There was a diſpoſition in the governing part of the people to keep
<pb n="428" facs="unknown:023166_0427_0FBC853FF7F7E950"/>
out of ſight the true cauſe of this grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſchief. Even the general Congreſs, in a public addreſs which they ordered to be read in the congregations,<note place="margin">Circular letter of Sept. 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Had this been intended as the language of bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſque, it might have been received with a ſmile; in any other ſenſe, it was an inſult to the feelings of honeſt men.</p>
            <p>In the midſt of theſe diſtreſſes, frequent meetings of different bodies of men were held, to conſult on ſome practicable modes of relief. Committees of counties, and of different States, at various times, formed projects, and iſſued public addreſſes; but palliatives in this, as in all other caſes, ſoon loſt their efficacy. From one of theſe Conventions, holden at Springfield, and compoſed of delegates from the New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land States and New-York;<note place="margin">July and Auguſt. MS mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes of Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</note> a letter was addreſſed to the general Congreſs, which put them on deviſing means to ſurmount the exiſting difficulties. Among other ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients they recommended effectual tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, the opening of loan-offices, and that the States individually ſhould emit no more bills of credit. Theſe were ſalutary
<pb n="429" facs="unknown:023166_0428_0FBC854174991680"/>
propoſals; but the moſt notable effect of this letter was a recommendation from Congreſs to the ſeveral States
<q>to confiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and make ſale of all the real and perſonal eſtates of ſuch of their inhabitants and other perſons as had forfeited the ſame,<note place="margin">Journal of Congreſs,</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Nov. 27.</note> and the right to the protection of their reſpective States; and to inveſt the money ariſing from the ſales in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental loan certificates, to be appropria<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted as the reſpective States ſhould di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This was a delicate point, and required the moſt critical diſcuſſion. It involved a queſtion of national law; and ſome per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who were acquainted with the ſubject, thought ſuch a ſtep not only illegal, but impolitic and dangerous. In caſes of war between independent nations,<note place="margin">Vatte<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging no common ſuperior, the acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of immoveable property is not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete till confirmed by a treaty of peace. The war between America and Britain was ſo far a war between two independent na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that the common laws of war ought to have been obſerved. Had the eſtates of abſentees been taken into poſſeſſion, and the income ariſing from them been applied to the ſupport of the war; and had the queſtion of property remained undecided
<pb n="430" facs="unknown:023166_0429_0FBC8543AFD80FE8"/>
till the concluſion of a peace, there is no doubt that the State would have been a gainer both in reputation and intereſt; but when we were daily cheating and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving ourſelves with a fraudulent paper medium, it is not ſtrange that the voice of juſtice toward thoſe whom we deemed our enemies could not be heard.</p>
            <p>The firſt ſtep toward executing this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commendation of Congreſs,<note place="margin">1778.</note> was an act proſcribing certain perſons, to the number of ſeventy-ſix, who had at various times, and for various reaſons, quitted this State. Theſe were forbidden to return without leave, under the penalty of tranſportation; and in caſe of a ſecond return, they were to ſuffer death.</p>
            <p>The next ſtep, was to confiſcate the whole eſtate, real and perſonal, of twenty-eight of the proſcribed; of whom it was declared that they had
<q>juſtly forfeited all right to protection from the State; and alſo their right to any farther enjoyment of their intereſt and property within it.</q>
            </p>
            <p>In theſe acts, no diſtinction was made between thoſe perſons who had withdrawn themſelves from the State, by a ſenſe of their duty; thoſe who were in fact Britiſh ſubjects, but occaſionally reſident here; thoſe who had abſconded through timidity;
<pb n="431" facs="unknown:023166_0430_0FBC85477A270A08"/>
and thoſe who had committed crimes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt expreſs law, and had fled from juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. No conditional offer of pardon was made; no time was allowed for any to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn and enter into the ſervice of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; but the whole were put indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately into one <hi>black liſt,</hi> and ſtigmatiſed as
<q>having baſely deſerted the cauſe of lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, and manifeſted a diſpoſition inimical to the State, and a deſign to aid its ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies in their wicked purpoſes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Some perſons who had legal demands on theſe eſtates, had for the ſecurity of their debts laid attachments on them; but by another act, all attachments which had been made ſince the commencement of hoſtilities, were declared null and void, and the Courts were required to diſmiſs them.</p>
            <p>Truſtees were appointed in each county to take poſſeſſion of all theſe eſtates, real and perſonal; and to ſell the perſonal im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately at public auction; with a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretionary power to leave out of the ſale, ſuch articles as they ſhould deem neceſſary, to the ſupport of the families of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. To preſerve ſome farther appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of juſtice, the creditors of theſe eſtates, though they were not allowed to bid at the auctions without payment, were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="432" facs="unknown:023166_0431_0FBC854911207DB0"/>
to exhibit their claims to the truſtees, and in caſes of inſolvency, all claims were to be ſettled by the Judges of Probate.</p>
            <p>Whilſt the ſettlement of theſe eſtates was going on, the money was rapidly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciating. After the year 1777, the State iſſued no more bills, and the former were called in and exchanged for Treaſurer's notes on intereſt, of a value not leſs than five pounds. The Continental bills con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued paſſing and depreciating till the ſpring of 1781, when ſuddenly, and by general conſent, they went out of circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſolid coin ſucceeded in their place. Then a ſcale of depreciation for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding years of the war was framed, and all paſt payments were regulated by it. The treaty of peace obliged us to proceed no farther in the matter of confiſcations. By a ſubſequent act, the Judges of Probate were empowered to liquidate by the ſcale of depreciation,<note place="margin">March 1<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 1783.</note> the ſums paid into the Treaſury by the Truſtees; to receive claims againſt the eſtates, and to adjuſt and cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify the ſame to the Preſident, who was authoriſed to order the Treaſurer, to iſſue notes, bearing intereſt from the time when the ſaid ſums were paid into the Treaſury; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

In this manner ſome of theſe eſtates have been ſettled and the creditors paid; others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unſettled.

Sir, After conſidering the great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lays in ſettling the demands againſt the eſtate of my ſon, Governor Wentworth, and the probability, from the ill management thereof, before it fell under your direction, that it will be greatly inſolvent; and feeling for the diſtreſs of many of the creditors, and wiſhing that all may have their juſt demands paid, I have determined to remove their embarraſſment as far as I can, by withdrawing my account and claim, until theirs be fully adjuſted and diſcharged, by you or other proper officers. Reſerving to myſelf ſtill the right of claiming, if there ſhould be found a ſurplus or balance in his favor. For as proved by my account and authentic vouchers ready to be produced, that, exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of my account before, I have paid off ſeveral creditors to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable amount, ſince he left this government; and had alſo greatly augmented the value of his eſtate at Wolfborough, by my advances and care thereof, all to the benefit of his preſent creditors. I ſhall therefore be greatly obliged, by your directing that my account be ſent me; and I ſhall hope for your future <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The clear profit to the State from all theſe confiſcations, as far as it has been aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, is inconſiderable.</p>
            <p>Power, when delegated without reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and for the abuſe of which the delegate is not held accountable, has a ſtrong tendency toward deſpotiſm. The temporary conſtitution which we had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted at the beginning of the war, was found, by experience, to have many im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfections; and the neceſſity of checks and excluſions became every day more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Other States were forming conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions on certain eſtabliſhed principles, and defining their rights as a preliminary to the delegation of power. An attempt of the like kind was made in New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.<note place="margin">1779.</note> A convention of delegates, choſen for the purpoſe, drew up and ſent abroad a ſyſtem of government; but ſo deficient was it in its principles, and ſo inadequate in its proviſions, that being propoſed to
<pb n="435" facs="unknown:023166_0434_0FBC854D8A1F1080"/>
the people, in their town-meetings, it was rejected. Another convention was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, which had more advantage than the former, the neighbouring State of Maſſachuſetts having digeſted and adopted a conſtitution, which was ſuppoſed to be an improvement on all which had been framed in America. This convention had no leſs than nine ſeſſions,<note place="margin">From June 1781, to Oct. 1783.</note> and continued for more than two years. In the firſt plan of government which they compoſed, they diſtinctly ſtated the alienable and unalien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rights of the people. They divided the government into three branches, le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative, executive and judicial, and defin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the limits of each. The legiſlative branch was compoſed of a Senate and Houſe of Repreſentatives. The Senate was to conſiſt of twelve perſons,<note place="margin">1781.</note> five for the county of Rockingham, two for Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, two for Hillſborough, two for Che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire and one for Grafton. Theſe were to be voted for in town-meetings, and the votes ſealed and returned to the Secretary's office. The number of Repreſentatives was limited to fifty, and apportioned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the counties, thus; twenty for Rockingham; eight for Strafford; ten for Hillſborough; eight for Cheſhire; and four for Grafton. Theſe were to be elect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="436" facs="unknown:023166_0435_0FBC854F51015CF0"/>
by County Conventions, conſiſting of one delegate for every fifty rateable polls. This mode was recommended, to prevent thoſe intereſted views and that party ſpirit, which too often-appear in ſingle towns in the election of Repreſentatives. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecutive power was veſted in a Governor, whom the convention, in their addreſs to the people, deſcribed in the following terms:
<q>They have arrayed him with honors, they have armed him with power and ſet him on high; but ſtill he is only the right hand of your power, and the mirror of your majeſty.</q>
But though armed with power and liable to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peached for miſconduct, he was ſhrouded from reſponſibility, by a Council, without whoſe advice he could not take one ſtep of any importance. The judicial depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was to be appointed by the executive and ſupported by the legiſlative; but the Judges were removeable for miſconduct, by the Governor and Council, on the addreſs of both Houſes of the Legiſlature. Juſtices of the Peace were to hold their commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions five years only. Proviſion was made for the excluſion of perſons from holding ſeveral offices at the ſame time; the reaſon of which was thus expreſſed.
<q>Beſides the interference of ſeveral offices held by
<pb n="437" facs="unknown:023166_0436_0FBC85512DE81EF8"/>
the ſame perſon in point of time, which we have ſeen, and the difficulty of one man's giving his attention to many mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſufficiently to underſtand them all, which we have too often felt; there is a ſtill ſtronger reaſon, which is the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of a man's preſerving his integrity in diſcharging the duties of each.</q>
The encouragement of literature was alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended as eſſential to the preſervation of a free government, and it was declared to be the duty of legiſlators to cheriſh its intereſts.</p>
            <p>This plan was printed and ſent to every town.<note place="margin">Sept. 14.</note> The inhabitants were requeſted to ſtate their objections diſtinctly to any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular part, and return them at a fixed time. The objections were ſo many and ſo various, that it became neceſſary to alter the form and ſend it out a ſecond time. The name of Governor, and moſt of his powers, were ſtill retained;<note place="margin">1782.</note> but the mode of repreſentation was altered.<note place="margin">Aug. 21.</note> Inſtead of being elected, by county conventions, the Repreſentatives were to be choſen imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately by the towns; every incorporated townſhip containing one hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty rateable polls, having the privilege of chooſing one; and every one containing four hundred and fifty, of chooſing two.
<pb n="438" facs="unknown:023166_0437_0FBC8554A348CA88"/>
Particular attention was given to the mode of appointing officers of militia. Inſtead of ſuperior officers being choſen by their inferiors, and inferior officers by the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vates, as had been practiſed ſince the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the war, the order of appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was reverſed, and the privates had no power of choice at all. This was ſaid to be nece<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ary to the preſervation of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, ſubordination and diſcipline. The ſecond plan being ſent out was generally approved; but it was not completed at the time when the news of peace arrived. The old form having expired with the war, it was,<note place="margin">1783.</note> by the votes of the people in their town-meetings,<note place="margin">March and April.</note> revived and continued for one year longer. In the following autumn, the new form was finiſhed;<note place="margin">Oct. 31.</note> and the name of Governor being changed to Preſident, it was a third time printed and declared to be 'the civil conſtitution for the State of New-Hampſhire.' It took place on the ſecond day of the following June,<note place="margin">1784.</note> and was introduced at Concord by a religious ſolemnity, which has ſince been repeated at every annual election.</p>
            <p>To the convention which formed this conſtitution ſeveral towns in the weſtern part of the State did not ſend delegates. The cauſe of this omiſſion, and of ſome
<pb n="439" facs="unknown:023166_0438_0FBC8555B84E5A38"/>
other eccentricities in the conduct of the people in that quarter muſt now be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants of the diſtrict on the weſtern ſide of Connecticut river, which was ſevered from New-Hampſhire in 1764, had been engaged in a long and bitter controverſy with the government of New-York. They had even been oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have recourſe to arms in defence of their eſtates; and frequent acts of violence had been committed. There was among them a ſet of intrepid men, ready to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter dangers, and trained to hardy en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe. At the commencement of hoſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, by the advice of ſome principal op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſers of the Britiſh Government, in the other Colonies, a company of thoſe people ſtyling themſelves Green Mountain Boys, marched to Ticonderoga, and wreſted that fortreſs, together with Crown-Point,<note place="margin">1775.</note> out of the hands of the Britiſh garriſons. A regiment of them was embodied by order and in the pay of the general Congreſs. Their exertions in the common cauſe were meritorious and their ſervices were accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able.</p>
            <p>Soon after the declaration of indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,<note place="margin">1776.</note> the inhabitants of that territory aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled in convention to conſider their
<pb n="440" facs="unknown:023166_0439_0FBC8557DD19EBB0"/>
peculiar ſituation and concert meaſures for their ſafety. The opportunity which then preſented for a change in their poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical connexions, was too precious to be loſt. By the diſſolution of the bonds which had held America in ſubjection to the Crown of Britain, they conceived themſelves free from the government of New-York, to which the moſt of them had never voluntarily ſubmitted; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they ſaid, reduced to
<q>a ſtate of nature,</q>
they thought that they had a right to form ſuch connexions as were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to themſelves. Accordingly they made and publiſhed a declaration;
<q>that they would at all times conſider them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as a free and independent State;<note place="margin">1777.</note> 
                  <note place="margin">Jan. 15.</note> capable of regulating their own internal police; that they had the ſole excluſive right of governing themſelves, in ſuch manner as they ſhould chooſe, not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to the reſolves of Congreſs; and that they were ready to contribute their proportion to the common defence.</q>
Under the influence of theſe principles, they formed a plan of government and a code of laws, and petitioned Congreſs to receive them into the union.</p>
            <p>The inhabitants on the eaſtern ſide of Connecticut river were very conveniently
<pb n="441" facs="unknown:023166_0440_0FBC8558C56ED2C8"/>
ſituated to unite with thoſe on the weſtern ſide,<note place="margin">1778.</note> and many of them had the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and views. They argued that the original grant of New-Hampſhire to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon was circumſcribed by a line drawn at the diſtance of ſixty miles from the ſea; that all the lands weſtward of that line, being royal grants, had been held in ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the government of New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire by force of the royal commiſſions, which were vacated by the aſſumed inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of the American Colonies; and therefore that the inhabitants of all thoſe lands had 'reverted to a ſtate of nature.<note place="margin">Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

They aſſerted that juriſdictions eſtabliſhed by royal commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions could bind a people together no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger than the force which firſt compelled continues to operate; but when the coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive power of the King was rejected, and
<pb n="442" facs="unknown:023166_0441_0FBC855A47D6CA48"/>
its operation had ceaſed, the people had a right to make a ſtand at the firſt legal ſtage, viz. their town incorporations. T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſe by univerſal conſent were held ſacred; hence they concluded that the major part of each one of thoſe towns had a right to control the minor part; and they conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves as ſo many diſtinct corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, until they ſhould agree to unite in one aggregate body.</p>
            <p>In theſe ſentiments the people were not all united. The majority of ſome towns was in favor of their former connexion, and in thoſe towns where the majority in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined the other way, the minority claim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed protection of the government.</p>
            <p>They ſuppoſed that the exiſtence of their town-incorporations, and of the privileges annexed to them, depended on their union to New-Hampſhire; and that their accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the grants was in effect an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgment of the juriſdiction, and a ſubmiſſion to the laws of the State; from which they could not fairly be diſengaged without its conſent; as the State had never injured or oppreſſed them.</p>
            <p>Much pains, were taken, by the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er party, to diſſeminate the new ideas. Conventions were held, pamphlets were printed, and at length a petition was

            <p>The Preſident of New-Hampſhire, in the name of the Aſſembly,<note place="margin">Aug. 22.</note> wrote to the Governor of Vermont, claiming the ſixteen towns as part of the State, the limits of which had been determined prior to the revolution; reminding him that thoſe towns had ſent delegates to the convention in 1775; that they had applied to the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly for arms and ammunition, which had been ſent to them; that their military officers had accepted commiſſions and obey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed orders from the government; that the minority of thoſe towns was averſe to a diſunion, and had claimed protection of the State, which the Aſſembly thought themſelves bound to afford; and beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to uſe his influence with the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of Vermont to diſſolve the newly formed connexion.</p>
            <p>At the ſame time, the Preſident wrote to the delegates of the State in Congreſs;<note place="margin">Aug. 19.</note> deſiring them to take advice and endeavour to obtain the interpoſition of that body;
<pb n="445" facs="unknown:023166_0444_0FBC8561B92FA600"/>
intimating his apprehenſion, that without it, the controverſy muſt be decided by the ſword, as every condeſcending meaſure had been uſed from the beginning and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</p>
            <p>The Governor and Council of Vermont ſent a meſſenger to Congreſs to ſee in what light the new State was viewed by them. On his return he reported, that the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs was unanimouſly oppoſed to the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the ſixteen towns with Vermont; otherwiſe they (excepting the delegates of New-York) had no objection to the inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence of the new State.</p>
            <p>At the next ſeſſion of the Vermont Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly at Windſor,<note place="margin">October.</note> when the Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the ſixteen towns had taken their ſeats, a debate aroſe on a queſtion, whether they ſhould be erected into a new county, which paſſed in the negative. Conceiving that they were not admitted to equal pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges with their brethren, the members from thoſe towns withdrew; and were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by ſeveral others belonging to the towns adjoining the river on the weſt ſide. They formed themſelves into a convention, and invited all the towns on both ſides of the river to unite, and ſet up another State by the name of New-Connecticut. This ſeceſſion had nearly proved fatal to the
<pb n="446" facs="unknown:023166_0445_0FBC8563334123B8"/>
State of Vermont. A ridge of mountains which extends from ſouth to north through that territory, ſeemed to form not only a natural, but a political line of diviſion. A more cordial union ſubſiſted between the people on the eaſtern ſide of the Green Mountains, and the eaſtern ſide of Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut river, than between the latter and thoſe on the weſtern ſide of the mountains; but theſe alone were inſufficient, without the others, to make a State. The Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor, and other leading men of Vermont, who reſided on the weſt ſide of the Moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, wrote letters to the Aſſembly of New-Hampſhire, informing them of the ſeparation, and expreſſing their diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of a connexion with the ſixteen towns. The Aſſembly regarded theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as ambiguous, and as not expreſſing a diſinclination to any <hi>future</hi> connexion with them. Jealouſy is ſaid to be a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publican virtue; it operated on this oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, and the event proved that it was not without foundation.</p>
            <p>A convention of delegates from ſeveral towns on both ſides of the river aſſembled at Corniſh and agreed to unite,<note place="margin">Dec 9.</note> without any regard to the limits eſtabliſhed by the King in 1764; and to make the following propoſals to New-Hampſhire, viz. either
<pb n="447" facs="unknown:023166_0446_0FBC8564B0643EA0"/>
to agree with them on a dividing line, or to ſubmit the diſpute to Congreſs, or to arbitrators mutually choſen. If neither of theſe propoſals were accepted, then, in caſe they could agree with New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire on a form of government, they would conſent that
<q>the whole of the grants on both ſides of the river ſhould connect themſelves with New-Hampſhire, and become one entire State, as before the royal determination in 1764.</q>
Till one or other of theſe propoſals ſhould be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with, they determined
<q>to truſt in Providence and defend themſelves.</q>
            </p>
            <p>An attempt was made in the following year to form a conſtitution for New-Hampſhire,<note place="margin">1779.</note> in which the limits of the State were ſaid to be the ſame as under the royal government,
<q>reſerving never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs our claim to the New-Hampſhire Grants weſt of Connecticut river.</q>
Tho' this form of government was rejected by a majority of the people; yet there was a diſpoſition in a great part of the Aſſembly to retain their claim to the whole of the grants weſtward of the river. At the ſame time the State of New-York ſet up a claim to the ſame lands, and it was ſuſpected, perhaps not without reaſon, that intrigues were forming to divide Vermont between
<pb n="448" facs="unknown:023166_0447_0FBC8568430F9990"/>
New-Hampſhire and New-York, by the ridge of mountains which runs through the territory. Certain it is that the Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>montors were alarmed; and, that they might have the ſame advantage of their adverſaries, they extended their claim weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward into New-York and eaſtward into New-Hampſhire; and thus not only the ſixteen towns, but ſeveral other towns in the counties of Cheſhire and Grafton, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came incorporated with Vermont by
<q>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles of union and confederation.</q>
            </p>

               </gap>erritory as far as Connecticut River, from which there was no diſpoſition to recede. That State had been always oppoſed to the independence of Vermont. New-Hampſhire at firſt ſeemed to acquieſce in it; and ſome letters which the Preſident wrote to the Governor of Vermont, when threatened with invaſion in 1777, were underſtood as an acknowledgment of it. Had there been no attempt to unite with the towns on the eaſtern ſide of the river, New-Hampſhire would perhaps never have oppoſed the independence of Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont. But the Aſſembly was afterward in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to claim all that territory, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

This interfered with the claim of New-York; and at the ſame time Maſſachuſetts put in a claim to a part of Vermont.

            <p>It was neceſſary that nine States ſhould be preſent in Congreſs, beſide thoſe whoſe claims were to be heard.

When the members from the eaſtern ſide of Connecticut river arrived, they found themſelves excluded from a ſeat in the Aſſembly, and took their leave with ſome expreſſions of bitterneſs.</p>
            <p>After this compliance, it was expected that Vermont would be admitted into the union, and the queſtion was ſolemnly put in Congreſs;<note place="margin">April 14.</note> but a majority decided a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it; to the no ſmall diſappointment of many perſons, beſide the inhabitants of the diſputed territory. The pretence for this deciſion was, that they had exceeded the limited time; but they had complied with the 'indiſpenſible preliminary;' and the order of Congreſs, requiring it, ſtood unrepealed.</p>
            <p>Though cut off from their connexion with Vermont, the revolted towns did not at once return to a ſtate of peace; but the diviſions and animoſities which had ſo long ſubſiſted, continued to produce diſagreeable effects.

<q>that the Court might be adjourned, and that no judicial proceedings might be had, whilſt the troubles in which the country had been involved ſtill ſubſiſted.</q>
They were told that the Judges could come to no de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination on the ſubject, but in open Court. When the Court was opened, their petition was publicly read; and the conſideration of it was poſtponed to the next day. The Court then proceeded to
<pb n="458" facs="unknown:023166_0457_0FBC857B9C381F00"/>
its common buſineſs. The Grand Jury being impannelled, the doors of the houſe where they met were kept open, whilſt the Attorney General laid before them the caſe of the rioters at the inferior Court. A bill was found againſt them. They were arraigned, they pleaded guilty, and caſt themſelves on the mercy of the Court. The Court remitted their puniſhment on condition of their future peaceable beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior. This well judged combination of firmneſs and lenity diſarmed the inſurg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents; and they quietly diſperſed. From that time the ſpirit of oppoſition to gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment in that quarter gradually abated; and the people returned to their connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with New-Hampſhire.</p>

            <p>THE American revolution had been crowned with ſucceſs, as far as it reſpected our emancipation from foreign juriſdiction, the eſtabliſhment of forms of government among ourſelves, and our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from war. It remained, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commodate the mind<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and manners of the people, under the new adminiſtration, to a regular courſe of juſtice, both public and private; to perfect the union of the States; and to eſtabliſh a ſyſtem of finance. Theſe things were neceſſary to make the revolution complete.</p>
            <p>The extremes of deſpotiſm on the one hand, and of licentiouſneſs on the other, are equally to be avoided. In a juſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium between theſe, a government well balanced and executed with vigor, is capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of producing the moſt valuable bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits. To this point it was neceſſary to conduct our revolution. But it was equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="460" facs="unknown:023166_0459_0FBC857E393923B0"/>
neceſſary, that it ſhould proceed by ſlow degrees; that errors in principle ſhould be gradually reformed; and that men ſhould be taught, by their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, the folly of relying on any ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of politics, which, however ſupported by popularity, is not founded in recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude.</p>
            <p>A large debt, accumulated by the war, remained to be diſcharged. For this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, requiſitions were made by Congreſs, as well as by the State Government. Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and gold, which had circulated largely in the latter years of the war, were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning, by the uſual courſe of trade, to thoſe countries, whence large quantities of neceſſary and unneceſſary commodities had been imported. Had any general ſyſtem of import been adopted, ſome part of this money might have been retained, and ſome part of the public debt diſcharged; but the power of Congreſs did not extend to this object; and the States were not unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the expediency of delegating new and ſufficient powers to that body. The partial impoſts, laid by ſome of the States, were ineffectual, as long as others found their intereſt in omitting them. Recourſe therefore was had to the uſual mode of taxation on polls and eſtates; by which means, a heavy burden was laid on the
<pb n="461" facs="unknown:023166_0460_0FBC8580043BC168"/>
huſbandman and the labourer. Thoſe who were punctual in their payments, ſaw no probable end of their exertions, whilſt the negligence of others occaſioned re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated demands. Private creditors, who had ſuffered by long forbearance, were importunate for their dues; and the Courts of Law were full of ſuits.</p>
            <p>The people who felt themſelves diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, held conferences with a view to deviſe means of redreſs. The moſt eaſy remedy which appeared to many of them, was a new emiſſion of paper bills, funded on real eſtate, and loaned on intereſt. To effect this, petitions were addreſſed to the Legiſlature; and to remedy the grievance,<note place="margin">1785.</note> as far as it was occaſioned by a debt of the State, an act was paſſed,<note place="margin">Feb. 24.</note> to draw into the Treaſury all notes iſſued by the State, and give certificates for the intereſt, and for fifteen per cent. of the principal, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually; which certificates were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the Treaſurer for taxes,
<q>in lieu of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and equal to ſilver and gold.</q>
By this means, it was expected that the debt would gradually be extinguiſhed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that the people would eaſily be enabled to pay at leaſt one ſpecies of their taxes.</p>
            <p>This was far from ſatisfying the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plainants. The public ſecurities, they
<pb n="462" facs="unknown:023166_0461_0FBC85834BEB4CD0"/>
ſaid, were engroſſed by rich ſpeculators, and the poor were diſtreſſed for the means of paying their taxes and their private debts. The cry for paper money was inceſſant; and the people were called up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the public papers,
<q>to aſſert their own majeſty, as the origin of power, and to make their Governors know, that they are but the executors of the public will.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this clamor, the voice of reaſon and juſtice calmly anſwered; that it was not in the power of the Legiſlature to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh any fund, which ſhould ſecure paper money from depreciation; that there was ſo much paper then in circulation, and the time of its redemption was ſo diſtant, that the notes paſſed at a diſcount of ſixty, and the certificates of twenty per cent; that if the quantity were increaſed, the depreciation would increaſe in proportion; that if bills were iſſued and made a tender in all payments, it would never be in the power of government to redeem them by ſilver and gold, becauſe none could be collected; and in that caſe, no part of the continental or foreign debt could be diſcharged; that if bills were loaned on land ſecurity, it would be in the power of the public debtor to purchaſe the bills at
<pb n="463" facs="unknown:023166_0462_0FBC8584B359B4C8"/>
a reduced value, and with them to make his payment at the Treaſury, in which caſe, though the public cheſt might be filled with paper, yet the government would ſuffer all the embarraſſment of poverty. It was added, that the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture were by the Conſtitution expreſsly forbidden to make retroſpective laws, and had no right to alter the nature of private contracts; and that ſhould the majority of the people petition the government to make pap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> a lawful tender, it would be their duty to reject the petition as uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutional. When it was propoſed, that the paper ſhould not be a tender for paſt but only for future contracts; it was anſwered, that this would not relieve the debtor, who was ſuffering for his paſt engagements, and the difficulties which it pretended to cure would ſtill exiſt.</p>
            <p>In vain were agriculture and manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, induſtry and frugality recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the only adequate ſources of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; the complainants had no diſpoſition to apply a remedy ſo ſlow in its operation; and indeed it was doubtful whether the utmoſt exertions in that way would have been ſufficient, completely to extricate us out of theſe difficulties, without ſome al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration in our confederated government.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="464" facs="unknown:023166_0463_0FBC8585B23C90B0"/>Similar difficulties, at the ſame time, exiſted in the neighbouring State of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts; to remedy which, among oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er palliatives, a law was paſſed called a <hi>tender-act,</hi>
               <q>by which it was provided that executions iſſued for private demands,<note place="margin">Minot's Hiſtory of the Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections, page 15.</note> might be ſatisfied by cattle and other enumerated articles, at an appraiſement of impartial men under oath.</q>
For ſuch a law the diſcontented party in New-Hampſhire petitioned; and to gratify them the Legiſlature enacted, that
<q>when any debtor ſhall tender to his creditor,<note place="margin">Nov. 8.</note> in ſatisfaction of an execution for debt, either real or perſonal eſtate ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, the body of the debtor ſhall be exempt from impriſonment, and the debt ſhall carry an intereſt of ſix per cent; the creditor being at lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty either to receive the eſtate, ſo tendered, at a value eſtimated by three appraiſers, or to keep alive the demand by taking out an alias, within one year after the return of any former execution, and levying it on any eſtate of the debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or which he can find.</q>
At the ſame time an act was made, enlarging the power er of Juſtices of the Peace, to try and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine actions of debt and treſpaſs to the value of ten pounds. Theſe laws
<pb n="465" facs="unknown:023166_0464_0FBC85872F562DE8"/>
were complained of as unconſtitutional; the former as being retroſpective, and changing the nature of contracts; the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as depriving the creditor, in certain caſes, of a right to trial by Jury. But ſo ſtrong was the clamor for redreſs of griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances; and ſo influential was the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the neighbouring State, that ſome of the beſt men in the Legiſlature found it neceſſary to comply; whilſt another part were ſecretly in favor of worſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.</p>
            <p>The tender-act, at firſt, was made for two years only; before the expiration of which it was revived, with ſome altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and continued for three years long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. The effect of this law, in caſes where an attempt was made to execute it, was, that the moſt valuable kinds of property were either concealed or made over to a third perſon; and when the Sheriff came with an execution, it was levied on ſuch articles as were of little uſe to the credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor. But the moſt general effect of the law was to prevent any demand on the pa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> of the creditor, and to encourage the debtor in neglecting payment.</p>
            <p>The ſcarcity of money was ſtill a griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which the laws had not remedied,<note place="margin">1786.</note> but rather had a tendency to increaſe.
<pb n="466" facs="unknown:023166_0465_0FBC8588C038E280"/>
To encourage its importation into the country the Legiſlature exempted from all port duties, except light-money, every veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel which ſhould bring gold and ſilver only; and from one half of the duties, if a ſum of money equal to one half of the cargo ſhould be imported<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But it was to no purpoſe to import money, unleſs en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement were given for its circula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which could not be expected whilſt the tender-act was in force; for every man who owned money thought it more ſecure in his own hands, than in the hands of others.</p>
            <p>The clamor for paper currency increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and, like a raging fever, approached toward a criſis. In every town there was a party in favor of it, and the public pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were continually filled with decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations on the ſubject. It was ſaid that an emiſſion of bills of credit would give a ſpring to commerce and encourage agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture; that the poor would be able to pay their debts and taxes; that all the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments againſt iſſuing paper were fram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by ſpeculators, and were intended to ſerve the wealthy part of the community, who had monopoliſed the public ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, that they might raiſe their value and get all the good bargains into their own
<pb n="467" facs="unknown:023166_0466_0FBC858C9B9BE6D0"/>
hands; that other States in the union had iſſued paper bills, and were rejoicing in the happy effects of their currency <hi>without any depreciation</hi>; that the people had a right to call upon their Repreſentatives to ſtamp a value on paper, or leather, or any other ſubſtance capable of receiving an impreſſion; and that to prevent its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciation, a law ſhould be enacted to puniſh with baniſhment and outlawry, every perſon who ſhould attempt by any means to leſſen its value.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <q>
                     <p>A ſpecimen of the language uſed on this occaſion is as follows. Seven States are now bleſſed with harmony, plenty and happineſs. Worthy, induſtrious men can go to market with a penny in their pockets; their benevolent friends, the farmers, meet them half way with cheerfulneſs, and are as ready to receive as they to offer; now one greets the other with ſocial benedictions, trade flouriſhes, agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture increaſes, mutual confidence is reſtored, and harmony reigns triumphant. Elyſian fields theſe! when contraſted with the bond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age of the inhabitants of New-Hampſhire; for 'in the midst of life, they are in death,' death of the worſt kind, penury and want of the common bleſſings of Providence. How long, freemen of New-Hampſhire, can ye bear the yoke of oppreſſion!</p>

            <p>The ſame party who were ſo zealous in favor of paper currency, and againſt laws which obliged them to pay their debts, proceeded to inveigh againſt Courts and lawyers. The Inferior Courts were repreſented as ſinecures for Judges and Clerks; the defaulting, appealing, demur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, abatements, fees and bills of coſts, without any deciſion, were complained of
<pb n="468" facs="unknown:023166_0467_0FBC858DEF135888"/>
as burdens, and an abolition of theſe Courts became a part of the popular cry. But the party did not content themſelves with writing in the public papers. An attempt was made to call a convention, at Concord, whilſt the Aſſembly was ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting there, who ſhould petition the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlature in favor of the plan; and it was thought, that the preſence of ſuch a body of men, convened at the ſame time and place, would have great weight. This attempt was defeated in a manner ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar and humorous.</p>
            <p>At the firſt ſitting of the Aſſembly, when five only of the members of the propoſed convention were in town,<note place="margin">June.</note> ſome wags, among whom were ſeveral young lawyers, pretended to have been choſen by the towns in which they lived for the ſame purpoſe. In conference with the five, they penetrated their views, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded them to poſt an advertiſement, for all the members who were in town to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble immediately; it being of the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt importance to preſent their petition as early in the ſeſſion as poſſible. By this means, ſixteen pretended members, with the five real ones, formed themſelves into a convention, chooſing one of the five their Preſident, and one of the ſixteen
<pb n="469" facs="unknown:023166_0468_0FBC858F76B84D00"/>
their Clerk. They carried on their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates and paſſed votes with much apparent ſolemnity. Having framed a petition, complaining in the moſt extravagant terms of their grievances; praying for a loan of <hi>three millions</hi> of dollars, funded on real eſtate; for the abolition of Inferi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Courts, and a reduction of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of lawyers, to two only in a county; and for a free trade with all the world; they went in proceſſion to the Aſſembly, (ſome of whom had been previouſly let into the ſecret) and with great formality preſented their petition, which was ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to lie on the table, and was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward withdrawn. The convention then diſſolved; and when others, who had been really choſen by the towns arrived, they were exceedingly mortified on finding their views for that time ſo completely fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated.</p>
            <p>The next effort of the party was to call County Conventions. Of what claſs of people theſe were compoſed, ſome idea may be formed from this circumſtance. An innholder, at whoſe houſe one of theſe conventions firſt met, refuſed to take their promiſe for lumber to pay the expenſe of their meeting; upon which they adjourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to a ware-houſe, belonging to one of
<pb n="470" facs="unknown:023166_0469_0FBC8590F855D448"/>
the party, and were treated with liquor gratis.</p>
            <p>From two of theſe conventions, and from ſeveral towns in different parts of the State, petitions were preſented to the Legiſlature,<note place="margin">Sept. 13.</note> at their ſeſſion in Exeter. On calm deliberation, theſe petitions appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be inconſiſtent with each other, with the conſtitution, with juſtice and public faith. But to ſtill the clamor and collect the real ſenſe of the people on the ſubject of paper currency; the Aſſembly formed a plan for the emiſſion of fifty thouſand pounds, to be let at four per cent. on land ſecurity; to be a tender in payment of State taxes, and for the fees and ſala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of public officers. This plan was immediately printed, and ſent to the ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral towns; and the people were deſired to give their opinions in town-meetings for and againſt it, and to make return of their votes to the Aſſembly at their next ſeſſion.</p>

               </gap> views of the party; the principal directors of which endeavoured to conceal themſelves, whilſt they perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a conſiderable number of perſons of various characters, to appear openly in ſupport of the petitions. They took
<pb n="471" facs="unknown:023166_0470_0FBC85929CC40380"/>
pains to ſpread falſe reports through the country; and among other things, it was ſaid that the Aſſembly had paſſed an act, to refund the value of the confiſcated eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, which was to be immediately aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the people.</p>
            <p>It muſt be obſerved, that at this time, cauſes of a ſimilar nature had excited numbers of people in ſome counties of Maſſachuſetts, to aſſemble in arms and prevent the Judicial Courts from ſitting. This example, aided by falſe reports, and a ſenſe of grievances, partly real and part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly imaginary, operated ſo powerfully on the minds of a number of people, in the weſtern part of the county of Rockingham; that on the morning of the twentieth of September,<note place="margin">Sept. 20.</note> about two hundred men aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled at Kingſton, ſix miles from Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, where they choſe leaders and procured a drum. By the help of ſome militia offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers they formed themſelves into military order, and in the afternoon marched to Exeter; about one third of them being armed with muſkets, and the others with ſwords and clubs. Having entered the confines of the town, they halted; and ſent a paper to the Aſſembly, ſigned by one of them who ſtyled himſelf modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, demanding an anſwer to their former
<pb n="472" facs="unknown:023166_0471_0FBC859575DF4E38"/>
petition immediately. They then march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through the town, and paraded before the meeting-houſe, where both Houſes of Aſſembly were holding a conference. The doors were open, and as many of them as were diſpoſed, entered. The Preſident, in a cool and deliberate ſpeech, explained the reaſons on which the Aſſembly had proceeded in rejecting the petitions; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed the weakneſs, inconſiſtency and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice of their requeſt; and ſaid, that if it were ever ſo juſt and proper in itſelf, and if the whole body of the people were in favor of it, yet the Legiſlature ought not to comply with it, whilſt ſurrounded by an armed force. To do this, would be, to betray the rights of the people, which they had all ſolemnly ſworn to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. He concluded by declaring, that no conſideration of perſonal danger would ever compel them to violate the rights of their conſtituents.</p>
            <p>This ſpeech being ended, the drum beat to arms; as many as had guns were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to load them with balls; ſentries were placed at the doors, and the whole Legiſlature were held priſoners; the mob threatening death to any perſon who ſhould attempt to eſcape, till their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands were granted. The Aſſembly went
<pb n="473" facs="unknown:023166_0472_0FBC8597338A9C50"/>
on with their buſineſs, taking no farther notice of the rioters, till the approach of evening; when the Preſident attempted to go out, but was ſtopped by an impen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etrable column. He then reaſoned with them, and warned them of the fatal ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency of their conduct, aſſuring them, that the force of the country would ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the government. Their anſwers to him were inſolent and reproachful. They raiſed a cry for paper-money, an equal diſtribution of property, and a releaſe from debts. The inhabitants of Exeter had all this time beheld with ſilence the inſult offered to the Legiſlature; having no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders to take arms, they reſtrained their indignation, till the duſk of the evening; when ſome of them beat a drum at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and others cried,
<q>Huzza for gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment! Bring up the artillery!</q>
At the ſound of theſe words the mob were ſtruck with a panic, and began to diſperſe. Their moderator ordered them to meet again, at nine of the clock the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and they ſcattered in every direction.</p>
            <p>The Aſſembly being thus at liberty, requeſted the Preſident to call out the force of the State to quell the inſurrection. In the evening he iſſued his orders, and before morning companies of militia, well
<pb n="474" facs="unknown:023166_0473_0FBC85988B1C6410"/>
armed, began to come in from the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring towns. By ten of the clock in the morning a ſufficient body of horſe and foot,<note place="margin">Sept. 21.</note> with field-pieces and military muſic, having arrived; the Preſident put them in motion againſt the inſurgents, who were then parading, about a mile diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant. Having by their ſpies obtained in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of the motion of the militia, the unarmed part of the inſurgents re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated to a hill beyond the river; the others kept their ground till a party of light-horſe appeared in view, and then the whole body retired. Some of them were taken by the purſuers; others recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered the bridge at King's-fall, and being met by thoſe who had firſt retreated, made an appearance as if they would diſpute the paſſage. Orders were given by one of their leaders to fire; but the force of the government appeared ſo formidable that they dared not to obey. The officers of the militia ruſhed in among them, ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their moderator and others to the number of forty, the reſt fled with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipitation, and no farther purſuit was made. The priſoners were diſarmed and conducted to the town; where they were brought to an examination before the Preſident and Council. Had theſe men
<pb n="475" facs="unknown:023166_0474_0FBC8599F567B8F0"/>
been engaged in a good cauſe, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by proper officers, they would have maintained the honor of their country, and fought her battles with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and perſeverance; but, conſcious that they were oppoſing a government of their own eſtabliſhing, their native fortitude forſook them; and being taken in arms, they gave an example of the moſt humil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iating ſubmiſſion. Moſt of them pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed to be aſhamed of their conduct, and their ſhame appeared to be ſincere.</p>
            <p>The dignity of government being thus vindicated, its lenity was equally conſpic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous. Six only of the priſoners were detained, and a party of light-horſe was ſent to apprehend two others of the moſt culpable. They were taken out of their beds and brought to Exeter. This man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oeuvre had an excellent effect, for ſome, who knew themſelves equally guilty, were afraid to ſleep in their own houſes. The Superior Court being then in ſeſſion at Exeter,<note place="margin">Sept. 25.</note> theſe eight priſoners were arraigned on an indictment for treaſon. One drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping on his knees, pleaded guilty; others heſitated when they pronounced the words 'not guilty.' They were ordered to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſe for their appearance at the next Superior Court, when their bonds were

diſcharged. Some of them, who belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Preſbyterian Churches, were cited before the eccleſiaſtical ſeſſion, and there cenſured, as oppoſers of juſt gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment. Others, being militia officers, were tried by a general Court Martial; of theſe, ſome were caſhiered, but not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capacitated for future ſervice; ſome were reprimanded, and others were acquitted. The whole oppoſition was completely ſubdued; wavering minds became ſettled; converts were made to the ſide of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and the ſyſtem of knavery received a deep wound, from which it has not ſince recovered.</p>
            <p>The plan which had been iſſued by the Aſſembly,<note place="margin">1787.</note> for emitting paper-money, was in courſe referred to the people, in their town-meetings; and at the next ſeſſion the returns were made, when a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority appeared againſt it.<note place="margin">J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>whether the Legiſlature can, conſiſtently with the conſtitution, and their oaths, paſs an act making paper bills of credit, a tender to diſcharge private contracts, made prior to the paſſing ſuch act?</q>
The other was,

            <p>To obſerve the progreſs of wiſdom and virtue, and the obſtacles which are laid in the way of vice, is a moſt pleaſing enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment to the philanthropiſt; and it is but juſt, in ſuch a contemplation, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge that ſuperintending influence, which brings good out of evil. It was feared by many, that the American revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution would not produce that ſum of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical happineſs which its warmeſt advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates had fondly predicted. The efforts of faction in ſeveral of the States were very alarming. In New-Hampſhire, the aſſault being made directly at the ſupreme head of the government, the force of the State immediately roſe and cruſhed it. In Maſſachuſetts, the attacks were made on the Judicial Courts, which of themſelves had no power effectually to oppoſe them. The diſaffection there roſe to a higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree; it was more extenſively diffuſed, and with more difficulty quelled. But at length the conſtitutional powers of gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment being exerted with vigor, the ſpirit of anarchy was ſuppreſſed. In an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other neighbouring State, the ſame ſpirit reigned triumphant. A depreciating cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rency was eſtabliſhed by law, and perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naciouſly adhered to by the government.</p>

               <pb n="478" facs="unknown:023166_0477_0FBC85A14271DEA8"/>The imbecility of the confederation by which the States were united, had long been felt, and ſome attempts had been making to ſtrengthen it; but the view of our ſituation at this time demonſtrated the total inefficacy of that conſtitution, to bind together thirteen diſtinct ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignties, over which no coercive power was eſtabliſhed, which could prevent or cure ſuch evils as threatened the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all public and private credit. Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily for the American union, the remedy exiſted within itſelf. The good ſense and public virtue of the great body of our citizens readily adopted the idea of a CONVENTION OF THE STATES. The firſt propoſal came from Virginia, where American liberty was firſt publicly aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, when it was flagrantly violated by the ſtamp-act. The name of <hi>Patrick Henry</hi> will ever be illuſtrious in the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merican annals for moving the reſolves of 1765; and the name of <hi>James Madiſon</hi> will be equally diſtinguiſhed for propoſing the Convention of 1787.</p>
            <p>To this Convention, which was holden at Philadelphia, all the States, except <hi>one,</hi> ſent their delegates. After a cloſe and particular inveſtigation, they produced a new federal Conſtitution; containing ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equate
<pb n="479" facs="unknown:023166_0478_0FBC85A238F52188"/>
remedies for thoſe political diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which had threatened with extinction, the liberty and independence of the Amer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ican States.</p>
            <p>Among other wiſe proviſions, to eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh juſtice and ſecure the bleſſings of lib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, thoſe which reſpect public and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate credit are not the leaſt conſpicuous. To ſupport the former, the Congreſs has a power which, by the firſt confederation, was not delegated,
<q>to lay and collect tax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, duties, impoſts, and exciſes, to pay the debts and provide for the common defence and general welfare of the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States.</q>
For the latter it is declared, that
<q>no State ſhall coin money, emit bills of credit, make any thing but gold and ſilver coin a tender in payment of debts, paſs any bills of attainder or ex poſt facto law, or any law impairing the obligation of contracts.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When this new Conſtitution was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the people, conventions were called in each State to conſider it. In theſe bodies, compoſed of perſons who repreſented impartially every claſs and deſcription of the people, and who were themſelves equally various in their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, habits and views; the Conſtitution underwent the moſt critical and ſevere
<pb n="480" facs="unknown:023166_0479_0FBC85A3ADDEF350"/>
diſcuſſion. Whilſt it was in debate, the anxiety of all parties was extended to the utmoſt degree, and the efforts of its friends and its oppoſers were unremitted.</p>
            <p>After the Conſtitution had been, with the help of ſome propoſed amendments,<note place="margin">1788.</note> adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Maſſachuſetts,<note place="margin">Feb. 13.</note> a convention was called at Exeter in New-Hampſhire. At its firſt meeting, a debate which continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ten days ended in an adjournment for four months; at the expiration of which term, in a ſhort ſeſſion of three days only at Concord,<note place="margin">June 21.</note> the queſtion for adopting and ratifying the Conſtitution, was, with the ſame help as in Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts, carried in the affirmative, by a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jority of eleven; the whole number preſent being one hundred and three. This was the <hi>ninth</hi> State in the union which ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the Conſtitution; and thus the number was completed which was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to put in motion the political ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chine. In about a month, two more States were added. Then a Congreſs was formed, and the illuſtrious WASHINGTON,<note place="margin">1789.</note> by the unanimous ſuffrage of the people, was placed in the firſt ſeat of government. Three other States, of which one is Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, have ſince been admitted into the union; and there is now in operation a
<pb n="481" facs="unknown:023166_0480_0FBC85A6E44D9FF8"/>
general ſyſtem of energetic government,<note place="margin">1790.</note> which pervades every part of the United States, and has already produced a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing alteration for the better. By the funding of the Continental debt, and the aſſumption of the debts of the individual States, into one general maſs, a founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is laid for the ſupport of public cred<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it; by which means the American revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appears to be completed. Let it be the ſincere prayer and endeavour of every thoughtful citizen, that ſuch harmony may prevail between the general govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and the juriſdiction of each State, as the peculiar delicacy of their connexion requires; and that the bleſſings of
<q>peace, liberty and ſafety,</q>
ſo dearly obtained, may deſcend inviolate to our poſterity.</p>

                  <salute>SIR,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I RECEIVED your favor of the 14th of November, by Mr. Brownſon. You cannot be at a loſs to know why I have not heretofore, and why I cannot now, ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs you in your public character, or anſwer you in mine: But the confidence which you have been pleaſed to repoſe in me, gives me an opportunity of offering you my ſentiments, as an individual, wiſhing moſt ard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently to ſee the peace and union of his country preſerved, and the juſt rights of the people of every part of it fully and firmly eſtabliſhed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="491" facs="unknown:023166_0489_0FBC8724DCE31888"/>It is not my buſineſs, neither do I think it neceſſary now, to diſcuſs the origin of the right of a number of inhabitants to that tract of country formerly diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the name of the New-Hampſhire Grants, and now known by that of Vermont. I will take it for granted that their right was good, becauſe Congreſs, by their reſolve of the 7th of Auguſt, imply it; and by that of the 21ſt, are willing fully to confirm it, provided the new State is confined to certain deſcribed bounds. It appears, therefore, to me, that the diſpute of boundary is the only one that exiſts, and that the being removed all further difficulties would be removed alſo, and the matter terminated to the ſatisfaction of all parties. Now I would aſk you candidly, whether the claim of the people of Vermont, was not, for a long time, confined ſolely, or very nearly, to that tract of country which is deſcribed in the reſolve of Congreſs of the 21ſt of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt laſt; and whether, agreeable to the tenor of your own letter to me, the late extention of your claim upon New-Hampſhire and New-York, was not more a polit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical manoeuvre, than one in which you conceived your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves juſtifiable. If my firſt queſtion be anſwered in the affirmative, it certainly bars your new claim. And if my ſecond be well founded, your end is anſwered, and you have nothing to do but withdraw your juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the confines of your old limits, and obtain an acknowledgment of independence and ſovereignty, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the reſolve of the 21ſt of Auguſt, for ſo much ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritory as does not interfere with the ancient eſtabliſhed bounds of New-York, New-Hampſhire and Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts. I perſuade myſelf you will ſee and acquieſce in the reaſon, the juſtice, and indeed the neceſſity of ſuch a deciſion.</p>
               <p>You muſt conſider, Sir, that the point now in diſpute is of the utmoſt political importance to the future union and peace of this great country. The State of Vermont, if acknowledged, will be the firſt new one admitted into the confederacy; and if ſuffered to encroach upon the ancient eſtabliſhed boundaries of the adjacent ones, will ſerve as a precedent for others, which it may hereafter be expedient to ſet off, to make the ſame unjuſtifiable
<pb n="492" facs="unknown:023166_0490_0FBC8725EDBB7948"/>
demands. Thus, in my private opinion, while it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hoves the Delegates of the States now confederated, to do ample juſtice to a body of people ſufficiently reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectable by their numbers, and entitled by other claims to be admitted into that confederation, it becomes them alſo to attend to the intereſts of their conſtituents, and ſee, that under the appearance of juſtice to one, they do not materially injure the rights of others. I am apt to think this is the prevailing opinion of Congreſs, and that your late extenſion of claim has, upon the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple I have above mentioned, rather diminiſhed than in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed your friends; and that, if ſuch extenſion ſhould be perſiſted in, it will be made a common cauſe, and not conſidered as only affecting the rights of thoſe States immediately intereſted in the loſs of territory; a loſs of too ſerious a nature not to claim the attention of any people. There is no calamity within the compaſs of my foreſight, which is more to be dreaded than a neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of <hi>coertion</hi> on the part of Congreſs; and conſequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly every endeavour ſhould be uſed to prevent the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſo diſagreeable a meaſure. It muſt involve the ruin of that State againſt which the reſentment of the others is pointed.</p>
               <p>I will only add a few words upon the ſubject of the negociations, which have been carried on between you and the enemy in Canada and in New-York. I will take it for granted, as you aſſert it, that they were ſo far innocent, that there never was any ſerious intention of joining Great-Britain in their attempts to ſubjugate your country; but it has had this certain bad tendency, it has ſerved to give ſome ground to that deluſive opinion of the enemy, and upon which they, in a great meaſure, found their hopes of ſucceſs; that they have numerous friends among us, who only want a proper opportunity to ſhew themſelves openly; and that internal diſputes and feuds will ſoon break us in pieces. At the ſame time the ſeeds of diſtrust and jealouſy are ſcattered among ourſelves by a conduct of this kind. If you are ſerious in your profeſſions, theſe will be additional mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives for accepting the terms which have been offered, (and which appear to me equitable) and thereby con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincing
<pb n="493" facs="unknown:023166_0491_0FBC8727A0DFA640"/>
the common enemy, that all their expectations of diſunion are vain, and that they have been worſted at their own weapon—deception.</p>
               <p>As you unboſom yourſelf to me, I thought I had the greater right of ſpeaking my ſentiments openly and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly to you. I have done ſo, and if they ſhould pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the effect which I moſt ſincerely wiſh, that of an honorable and amicable adjuſtment of a matter, which, if carried to hoſtile lengths, may deſtroy the future hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of my country, I ſhall have attained my end, while the enemy will be defeated of theirs.</p>
               <p>Believe me to be, with great reſpect,</p>
