            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>That by the falſe and unjuſt Returns of ſome Sheriffs, ſeveral who at preſent ſit as Members of the Houſe) have been petitioned againſt, that their Elections and Returns may be fairly tryed and determined.</p>
            <p>That contrary to all Law, Juſtice, and the conſtant Practice of all Engliſh Aſſemblies, the ſaid diſputed Members have ſate in the Houſe, and by their Number (joyned with ſome few others) have made the greater Vote in the Houſe, &amp; thereh have conſtituted Orders how their own diſputed Elections ſhould be tryed. By which Orders they have prevented all Complainants from being heard, have unjuſtly excluded ſeveral legal Sworn Members, without hearing their Defence, and have arbitrarily obtruded themſelves upon the Houſe.</p>
            <p>That the Inſolence of the preſent Speaker, Mr. <hi>Phillip French</hi> hath been ſo great, that (being choſen Speaker by Votes of the diſputed Members) during the Diſpute about his own Election, (the Complainants being abſent &amp; unheard) he continued in the Houſe, argued and debated his own Cauſe, with Threats, Menaces and Reproachful Language to the Repreſentatives, and arbitrarily himſelf put the Queſtion about the juſtneſs of the Sheriffs Return of himſelf.</p>
            <p>By which Proceedings theſe Remonſtrants do apprehend, that the legal Rights and Priviledges of Aſſemblies are overturned and deſtroyed. Nor can they with Honour, Conſcience, or a juſt Diſcharge of the Truſt repoſed in them by their Country, ſit, joyn or act with theſe diſputed Members, until they fairly ſubmit the hearing of the ſaid Diſputes before his Excellency, the Earl of <hi>Bellomont</hi> and Council, and have their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the matter, to which theſe Remonſtrants will humbly ſubmit.</p>

            <p>WHereas we have made an humble Petition to your Lordſhip and Council, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth a Remonſtrance we had made to the Houſe of Repreſentatives, which they had rejected, &amp; therefore praying we might be heard, or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe that the preſent Aſſembly might be Diſſolved, the major Vote of which being made by the Unjuſt Returns of corrupt Sheriffs. On which Petition your Lordſhip did admit us, with the Houſe together, into your Preſence, and did, with great Piety and Juſtice, exhort us to go together and reconcile our Differences, and give and receive Satisfaction, that his Majeſties Service, and the good of the Country might be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted. Accordingly we went to the Houſe, and deſired Mr. Speaker that we might have ſome Satisfaction given us, in relation to our Remonſtrance and Petition, which he with great Violence denyed, and would not permit our Petition to your Lordſhip to be read, but inſtead thereof he himſelf, and others with him, who are not choſen by the People, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

And as we have made our Proteſts to the Houſe againſt their Proceedings, So we crave leave to aſſure your Lordſhip and Council of our Inviolable Loyalty to his Sacred Majeſty King <hi>William,</hi> (for whoſe ſake two Members of this preſent Aſſembly have been excluded the Houſe, as attainted of Treaſon for moſt early appearing in the late happy Revolution, for which they have obtained his Majeſties Gracious Pardon) That with a chearful and ready Obedience to your Lordſhips Government, under which we are aſſured our Engliſh Conſtitutions ſhall not be undermined by Wicked Men.</p>
            <p>And we laſtly crave leave to make this our Proteſt to your Lordſhip and Council, (in behalf of the Counties we repreſent againſt all manner of Acts and things that ſhall be concluded on or done by thoſe pretended Members now ſitting, that our Country may not be obliged to obey Laws made by thoſe who are not choſen by the Country, but have, ſince their ſitting, violently over-run all common Decency and Order, as well as the Rights and Liberties of the People.

            <p>HIs Excellency did acquaint the Council, that the Heats and Annimoſities in the Aſſembly were ſo great that they did altogether obſtruct the Kings Service, that the matter is unpreſidented, and no means can be found effectual to reconcile the Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferences; and his Majeſty having entruſted him with the Prerogative of Adjourning, Proroguing and Diſſolving of Aſſemblies, he muſt now make uſe of that Authority, and did declare his Reſolution to Diſſolve the Aſſembly. And order'd to be read a Proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſix Remonſtrators, in behalf of the Counties they repreſent, againſt all Laws that may be made.</p>

I am ſorry your Carriage ſince hath been ſo contrary thereto, that it is abſolutely neceſſary for the Kings Service, and the Safety and Peace of the Government that you ſhould be Diſſolved. Your Proceedings have been ſo Unwarrantable, wholly tending to Strife and Diviſion, and indeed Diſloyal to his Majeſty and his Laws, and Deſtructive to the Rights and Liberties of the People, that I do think fit to Diſſolve this preſent Aſſembly, and it is Diſſolved accordingly.</p>
