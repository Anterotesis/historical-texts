            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>SECTION III.</hi> On the Nature and Conſtitution of our Church.</head>
               <p>WE are thoroughly convinced, that the Church of England, to which we have been united, is deficient in ſeveral of the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Parts of Chriſtian Diſcipline; and that (a few Miniſters and Members excepted) it has loſt the Life and Power of Religion. We are not
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020522_0005_0FAF3A5E9AFF5C98"/>
ignorant of the Spirit and Deſigns it has ever diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in Europe, of riſing to Pre-eminence and worldly Dignities by Virtue of a national Eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by the moſt ſervile Devotion to the Will of temporal Governors: and we fear, the ſame Spirit will lead the ſame Church in theſe United States (tho' altered in its Name) to ſimilar Deſigns and Attempts, if the Number and Strength of its Members will ever afford a Probability of Succeſs; and particularly, to obtain a national Eſtabliſhment which we cordially abhor as the great Bane of Truth and Holineſs, the greateſt Impediment in the World to the Progreſs of vital Chriſtianity.</p>
               <p>For theſe Reaſons, we have thought it our Duty to form ourſelves into an Independent Church. And as the moſt excellent Mode of Church Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment according to our matureſt Judgment, is that of <hi>a moderate Epiſcopacy;</hi> and as we are perſuaded, <hi>that the uninterrupted Succeſſion of Biſhops from the Apoſtles,</hi> can be proved neither from Scripture nor Antiquity; we therefore have conſtituted ourſelves into an <hi>Epiſcopal Church,</hi> under the Direction of <hi>Biſhops, Elders, Deacons,</hi> and <hi>Preachers,</hi> according to the Forms of Ordination annexed to our Prayer Book, and the Regulations laid down in this Form of Diſcipline.</p>

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Be diligent. Never be unemployed. Never be triflingly employed. Never trifle away Time; neither ſpend any more Time at any Place than is ſtrictly neceſſary.</p>

               <p n="6">6. Speak Evil of no one: Elſe your Word eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially would eat as doth a Canker. Keep your Thoughts within your own Breaſt, till you come to the Perſon concerned.</p>
               <p n="7">7. Tell every one under your Care, what you think wrong in his Conduct and Tempers, and that plainly as ſoon as may be: Elſe it will feſter in your Heart. Make all Haſte to caſt the Fire out of your Boſom.</p>
               <p n="8">8. Do not affect the Gentleman. You have no more to do with this Character than with that of a Dancing-Maſter. A Preacher of the Goſpel is the Servant of all.</p>

               <p n="11">11. You have nothing to do but to ſave Souls. Therefore ſpend and be ſpent in this Work. And go always not only to thoſe that want, but to thoſe that want you moſt.</p>
               <p>Obſerve. It is not your Buſineſs to preach ſo many Times, and to take Care of this or that Society: But to ſave as many Souls as you can; to bring as many Sinners as you poſſibly can to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and with all your Power to build them up in that Holineſs, without which they cannot ſee the Lord. And remember! A Methodiſt Preacher is to mind every Point, great and ſmall, in the Methodiſt Diſcipline! Therefore you will need to exerciſe all the Senſe you have.</p>
               <p n="12">12. Act in all Things, not according to your own Will, but as a Son in the Goſpel. As ſuch it is your Part to employ your Time in the Manner which we direct: Partly in preaching and viſiting from Houſe to Houſe: Partly in reading, Medita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Prayer.

Life? Are you groaning after it? Are you reſolved to devote yourſelf wholly to God and his Work? Do you know the Rules of the Society? Of the Bands? Do you keep them? Do you conſtantly attend the Sacrament? Have you read the Form of Diſcipline? Are you willing to conform to it? Have you conſidered the Rules of a Preacher; eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the firſt, tenth and twelfth? Will you keep them for Conſcience Sake? Are you determined to employ all your Time in the Work of God? Will you endeavour not to ſpeak too long or too loud? Will you diligently inſtruct the Children in every Place? Will you viſit from Houſe to Houſe? Will you recommend Faſting or Abſtinence, both by Precept and Example? Are you in Debt?</p>
               <p>We may then, if he gives Satisfaction, receive him as a Probationer, by giving him the Form of Diſcipline, inſcribed thus: To A.

One on Trial, may be either admitted or rejected, without doing him any Wrong; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it would be no Trial at all. Let every Dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con explain this to them that are on Trial.</p>

Do you converſe ſeriouſly, uſefully and cloſely? To be more particular: Do you uſe all the Means of Grace yourſelf, and inforce the Uſe of them on all other Perſons?

               <p n="1">I. The Inſtituted are,</p>

               <p>Theſe Means may be uſed without Fruit. But there are ſome Means which cannot; namely, Watching, Denying ourſelves, taking up our Croſs, Exerciſe of the Preſence of God.</p>

               <p n="3">3. Wherein do you take up your Croſs daily? Do you chearfully bear your Croſs (whatever is grievous to Nature) as a Gift of God, and labour to profit thereby?</p>
               <p n="4">4. Do you endeavour to ſet God always before you? To ſee His Eye continually fixed upon you? Never can you uſe theſe Means, but a Bleſſing will enſue. And the more you uſe them, the more will you grow in Grace.</p>

them frequently and explicitly preach the Truth, but not in a controverſial Way. And let them take Care to do it in Love and Gentleneſs: Not in Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terneſs, returning Railing for Railing. 3. Anſwer all the Objections of our People as Occaſion offers.

               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. With Regard to Man's Faithfulneſs, Our Lord himſelf taught us to uſe the Expreſſion. Therefore we ought never to be aſhamed of it. We ought ſteadily to aſſert upon his Authority, that if a Man is not faithful in the unrighteouſs Mammon, God will not give him the true Riches.</p>
               <p n="2">2. With regard to working for Life, which our Lord expreſsly commands us to do. Labour <hi>(erga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zeſthe)</hi> literally <hi>work for the Meat that endureth to everlaſting Life.</hi> And in Fact every Believer till he comes to Glory, works for, as well as from Life.</p>
               <p n="3">3. We have received it as a Maxim, that "A Man is to do nothing in order to Juſtification:" Nothing can be more falſe. Whoever deſires to find Favour with God, ſhould ceaſe from Evil, and learn to do well. So God Himſelf teaches by the Prophet Iſaiah. Whoever repents, ſhould do Works meet for Repentance: And if this is not in order to find Favour, what does he do for them?</p>
               <p>Once more review the whole Affair.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Who of us is now accepted of God?</p>
               <p>He that now believes in Chriſt with a loving, obedient Heart.</p>
               <p n="2">2. But who among thoſe that never heard of Chriſt?</p>
               <p>He that according to the Light he has, ſcareth God, and worketh Righteouſneſs.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Is this the ſame with, He that is ſincere?</p>

                  <pb n="26" facs="unknown:020522_0025_0FAF3A6E1C27B3E0"/>Nearly, if not quite.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Is not this Salvation by Works?</p>
               <p>Not by the Merit of Works, but by Works as a Condition.</p>
               <p n="5">5. The grand Objection to one of the preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Propoſitions, is drawn from Matter of Fact. God does in Fact juſtify thoſe who by their own Confeſſion neither feared God, nor wrought Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs. Is this an Exception to the general Rule?</p>
               <p>It is a Doubt whether God makes any Exception at all. But how are we ſure that the Perſon in queſtion never did fear God, and work Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?</p>
               <p>His own thinking ſo, is no Proof. For we know how all that are convinced of ſin, undervalue them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in every Reſpect.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Does not talking without proper Caution of a juſtified or ſanctified State, tend to miſlead Men? Almoſt naturally leading them to truſt in what was done in one Moment?

Which of you ſpends as many Hours a Day in God's Work, as you did formerly in Man's Work? We talk, talk—or read Hiſtory, or what comes next to Hand. We muſt, abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely muſt, cure this Evil, or betray the Cauſe of God. But how? 1. Read the moſt uſeful Books, and that regularly and conſtantly. Steadily ſpend all the Morning in this Employment, or at leaſt five Hours in four and twenty. "But I have no Taſte for reading." Contract a Taſte for it by Uſe, or return to your former Employment. "But I have no Books." Be diligent to ſpread the Books, and you will have the Uſe of them.</p>

               <p>LET us ſtrongly and explicitly exhort all Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers to go on to Perfection. That we may all ſpeak the ſame Thing, we aſk once for all, Shall we defend this Perfection, or give it up? We all agree to defend it, meaning thereby (as we did from the Beginning) Salvation from all Sin, by the Love of God and Man filling our Heart. The Papiſts ſay, "This cannot be attained till we have been refined by the Fire of Purgatory." Some Profeſſors ſay, "Nay, it will be attained as ſoon as the Soul and Body part." Others ſay, "It may be attained before we die: A Moment after is too late." Is it ſo, or not? We are all agreed, we may be ſaved from all Sin before Death. The Subſtance then is ſettled. But as to the Circumſtances, is the Change gradual or inſtantaneous! It is both the one and the other. "But ſhould we in Preaching inſiſt both on one and the other?" Certainly we ſhould inſiſt on the gradual Change; and that ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly and continually. And are there not Reaſons why we ſhould inſiſt on the inſtantaneous alſo?

we not encourage all Believers to expect it? And the rather, becauſe conſtant Experience ſhews, the more earneſtly they expect this, the more ſwiftly and ſteadily does the gradual Work of God go on in their Souls; the more careful are they to grow in Grace; the more zealous of good Works, and the more punctual in their Attendance on all the Ordinances of God; (whereas juſt the contrary Effects are obſerved, whenever this Expectation ceaſes.) They are ſaved by Hope, by this Hope of a total Change, with a gradually increaſing Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation. Deſtroy this Hope, and that Salvation ſtands ſtill, or rather decreaſes daily. Therefore whoever would advance the gradual Change in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, ſhould ſtrongly inſiſt on the inſtantaneous.</p>

very ſuperficial among us. We can but juſt touch on a few Generals. How little Faith is there among us? How little Communion with God? How little living in Heaven, walking in Eternity, Deadneſs to every Creature? How much Love of the World? Deſire of Pleaſure, of Eaſe, of getting Money? How little brotherly Love? What continual Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one another? What Goſſipping, Evil-ſpeaking. Tale-bearing? What Want of moral Honeſty? To inſtance only one Particular; Who does as he would be done by, in buying and ſelling?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Family-Religion is wanting in many Branches. And what avails Public Preaching alone, though we could preach like Angels? We muſt, yea, every Travelling-Preacher muſt inſtruct them from Houſe to Houſe. Till this is done, and that in good Ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt, the Methodiſts will be little better than other People.</p>
               <p>Our Religion is not deep, univerſal, uniform; but ſuperficial, partial, uneven. It will be ſo, till we ſpend half as much Time in this Viſiting, as we now do in talking uſeleſsly. Can we find a better Method of doing this than Mr. Baxter's? If not, let us adopt it without Delay. His whole Tract, intitled, <hi>Gildas Salvianus,</hi> is well worth a careful Peruſal. Speaking of this viſiting from Houſe to Houſe, he ſays, (p. 351.)</p>
               <p>"We ſhall find many Hindrances, both in our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the People.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In ourſelves, there is much Dulneſs and Lazi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſo that there will be much ado to get us to be faithful in the Work.</p>
               <p n="2">2. We have a baſe, man-pleaſing Temper, ſo that we let Men periſh, rather than loſe their Love; we let them go quietly to Hell, leſt we ſhould offend them.</p>

               <p n="4">4. But the greateſt Hindrance is Weakneſs of Faith. Our whole Motion is weak, becauſe the Spring of it is weak.</p>

How few know how to deal with Men, ſo as to get within them, and ſuit all our Diſcourſe to their ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Conditions and Tempers: To chuſe the fitteſt Subjects, and follow them with a holy Mixture of Seriouſneſs and Terror, and Love, and Meekneſs?</p>
               <p>But undoubtedly this private Application is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in thoſe ſolemn Words of the Apoſtle, <hi>I charge thee before God and the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall judge the Quick and Dead at his appearing, preach the Word, be inſtant in Seaſon, out of Seaſon: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, rebuke, exhort, with all Long-ſuffering.</hi>

If the common Lukewarmneſs were baniſhed, and every Shop, and every Houſe buſied in ſpeaking of the Words and Works of God; ſurely God would dwell in our Habitations, and make us His Delight.</p>

Look round and ſee how many of them are ſtill in apparent Danger of Damnation. And how can you walk, and talk, and be merry with ſuch People, when you know their Caſe? Methinks when you look them in the Face, you ſhould break forth into Tears, as the Prophet did when he looked upon Hazael, and then ſet on them with the moſt vehement Exhortations.

Help to ſend forth able, willing Labourers into your Lord's Harveſt: So ſhall ye be aſſiſtant in ſaving Souls from Death, and hiding a Multitude of Sins.
