            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>PSALM CXLIV. 15.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>Yea, happy is that people whoſe GOD is the LORD.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IN this paſſage of ſacred ſcripture, that people is pronounced happy, whoſe God is the LORD. But what is the meaning of the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, "whoſe God is the LORD?" or when may it be truly ſaid, that the God of any peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is the LORD? The anſwer is, when they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, worſhip and obey the Lord or Jehovah, as the only true God, and that according to his revealed will. The Lord was the God of the Iſraelites, when they complied with the diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, under which they lived; and he is our God, when we cordially believe and comply with the goſpel. If we do ſo, the text pronoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces us happy; and it plainly implies, that we cannot be happy on any condition ſhort of this.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:026934_0005_0FD26CDACC546EE0"/>
THEREFORE the ſubject, which I beg leave to propoſe from our text for preſent conſideration, is this, The neceſſity of a belief of chriſtianity by the citizens of this ſtate, in order to our public and political proſperity. This propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is plainly implied in the text. For if that people only be happy or proſperous, whoſe God is the Lord; and if to believe and comply with chriſtianity be implied in having the Lord for our God; it follows, that the belief of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity by the citizens of this ſtate, is neceſſary to our political proſperity.</p>
            <p>POLITICAL proſperity requires the general practice of a ſtrict morality. But this cannot be ſo well ſecured by any other means, as by a belief of chriſtianity. Motives of a religious kind appear to be neceſſary to reſtrain men from vice and immorality. Civil pains and penalities alone are by no means ſufficient to this end; nor are civil honours and rewards ſufficient encouragements to the practice of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in general. The civil magiſtrate does not pretend to reward virtue in general according to its moral excellency. He does indeed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſome particular acts of virtue, which are highly beneficial to the public. But the many virtues of private life paſs without any other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward from him, than the bare protection, which is afforded in common to the perſons who prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe thoſe virtues, and to all who are free from groſs crimes.</p>
            <p>NOR does the magiſtrate pretend to puniſh vice in general. He does undertake to puniſh thoſe groſs vices, which conſiſt in the violations of the <hi>perfect</hi> rights of men, and in thoſe caſes
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026934_0006_0FD26CDEC0309D50"/>
only, in which the violations are both manifeſt and are manifeſtly proved before a proper tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bunal. But all violations of even theſe rights which are perpetrated in private, or which, though perpetrated publicly, are not legally proved, paſs entirely free from civil pains and penalties. The ſame is true of all violations of the <hi>imperfect</hi> rights, as they are called, which are violated by ingratitude, ſelfiſhneſs, neglect of kind offices, &amp;c. Yet theſe vices are in their conſequences, often as hurtful to the public good, as injuſtice, fraud or robbery; and indeed the former are the ſource of the latter. Now to reſtrain from vices of this latter deſcription, from all vices practiſed in private, and from vice in general, nothing is ſo uſeful as a full belief of a final judgment, and of a ſubſequent ſtate of rewards and puniſhments, in which all ſin not renounced by ſincere repentance, ſhall be puniſhed, and every man ſhall receive accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to that which he does in the body, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be good or evil.</p>
            <p>LET us ſuppoſe a citizen reſtrained from vice by the fear of civil penalties only. Such a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will feel himſelf under no obligation to pay either public or private debts, unleſs he expects legal judgment and execution; and under no obligation to ſpeak the truth, unleſs he fears a proſecution for fraud or defamation. He will feel himſelf at liberty to live in idleneſs, profu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, intemperance and luſt, and to take every advantage conſiſtent with law, to defraud and oppreſs his fellow citizens. He will requite no kind offices, as he has no motive to gratitude. He will have no motive to the greater part of his duty to his own children, and in a thouſand
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:026934_0007_0FD26CDFE5842040"/>
inſtances may neglect them, when he is bound by the ſtricteſt moral obligation, to aſſiſt and do them good. He may indulge himſelf in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and ill nature, in contention and violence, ſo far as not to expoſe himſelf to the law; and of courſe will take no pains to preſerve peace among his neighbours; but will rather, as his humour happens to be, foment by words and actions, animoſities, law-ſuits and contentions in every form. Ever complaining under the mild<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and juſteſt government, he will in number<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ways oppoſe meaſures, and eſpecially expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, ſubſervient and neceſſary to the public good; and will excite and ſpread diſcontent among others. Now is this a good citizen? What if the whole ſtate conſiſted of ſuch citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens? Could it enjoy political proſperity?</p>
            <p>THE beſt and perhaps the only remedy for ſuch diſeaſes, is a full belief of the divine univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal providence, of the accountableneſs of all men to God for all their conduct, and of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture equal retribution.</p>
            <p>SOME religion then, and ſome belief of a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſtate is neceſſary to our political proſperity. But what religion ſhall we adopt? and what ſyſtem concerning a future ſtate is moſt uſeful to the ſtate? It is not poſſible to introduce and give a general ſpread through the ſtate, to Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hometaniſm or Paganiſm; and it would be a work of time and of great difficulty, to lead the citizens in general into the belief of Deiſm or what is called the philoſophical religion. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſeem neceſſitated to have recourſe to chriſtianity: and this is moſt excellently adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the ends of reſtraining men from vice and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026934_0008_0FD26CE196694E00"/>
promoting that general practice of ſtrict morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, which is ſo eſſential to the political proſperity of any people. It is adapted to theſe ends by its precepts; by the moral character of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of thoſe precepts; by his abſolute ſupremacy and ſovereignty; by the motives of reward and puniſhment with which thoſe precepts are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced; by the facts which it relates, and by the examples which it exhibits. It is enforced not by the bare authority of our feeble reaſon, but by the authority of our Creator, our Judge, and our all-perfect God. It depends not on the obſcure inveſtigations, ſubtil refinements and uncertain concluſions of human intellect; but on the omniſcience, the veracity, the juſtice, the goodneſs and the will of God: And thus it is excellently adapted to the principles and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which are common to human nature, and which exiſt in the weakeſt and moſt ignorant, as well as the moſt intelligent and learned. A man who cannot follow the ſhorteſt and moſt eaſy chain of reaſoning on the nature of things and the tendency of human actions, and who will not from ſuch reaſoning feel his obligation to vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in general or to particular virtues, will at once feel the force of the poſitive and authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive declarations and requiſitions of the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: and where is the man, learned or unlearn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, of weak or ſtrong powers, who does not ſee and feel the difference between the advice and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections of ſome learned and acute philoſopher, and <hi>thus ſaith the Lord?</hi> Above all, the motives ariſing from the doctrines of the final judgment and a future ſtate, lay an inconceivably greater reſtraint on the depravity of human nature, than any thing that is or can be ſuggeſted by the phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical religion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:026934_0009_0FD26CE78C9AC6B0"/>
LET us compare this religion with chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in a few particulars, which immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late to our preſent ſubject.</p>
            <p>IT is a maxim of infidelity to follow <hi>nature.</hi> Now to follow her, is to follow all the appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and paſſions of which we are naturally the ſubjects; and this will lead to all kinds of vice. But it is a maxim of chriſtianity, to follow the divine law, the precepts of the goſpel and the example of Chriſt: and whether theſe lead to vice or virtue, I need not inform you.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER maxim of infidelity is, that man was made for his own happineſs; that is, that every man was made for his own individual hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. This then is to be the ſupreme object of every man; and this object is to be purſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as infidels themſelves teach, by gratifying his natural appetites and paſſions, which brings us juſt where we were before, to all vice and wickedneſs: And if an infidel deny his appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites and paſſions, he muſt be governed by oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er motives than any which his ſyſtem of morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſuggeſts. But chriſtianity teaches, that we were created for an end, which ſo far as we pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue, we cannot fail of ſincere piety and ſtrict morality.</p>
            <p>INFIDELS are divided into two claſſes, thoſe who deny a future ſtate of exiſtence, and thoſe who allow ſuch a ſtate. The former deny all moral government of God, and that we are at all accountable to him; and ſome of the moſt noted among them deny any evidence of his moral perfections. Now it is manifeſt, that according to this ſyſtem mankind can be under
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026934_0010_0FD26CEB8E3B2870"/>
no reſtraint from vice, by the conſideration of a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments, or by the conſideration of their accountableneſs to God, or of his commands or prohibitions. Nor does this ſyſtem admit of any motives de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from theſe ſources, to the practice of virtue. Yet theſe motives, with reſpect to mankind in the groſs, are the moſt powerful. The authors and abettors of this ſyſtem ſeem to rely on <hi>a ſenſe of honour,</hi> as the great motive to virtue and reſtraint from vice. And what is this <hi>ſenſe of honour?</hi> If it be a ſenſe of ſhame in doing wrong, and a ſenſe of the honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleneſs of doing right, it is a mere ſenſe or knowledge of right and wrong; and this ſo far as it is founded on truth, is undoubtedly a proper rule of conduct, and a man who is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to virtue, will practiſe according to this rule. But how are men in general, without the aid of revelation, to attain, in all caſes, to the knowledge of right and wrong, of virtue and vice? It is manifeſt by abundant experience both antient and modern, that mere human reaſon is inſufficient for this.</p>
            <p>IF by this ſenſe of honour be meant, as I im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine is generally meant, a ſenſe of our own ſuppoſed perſonal dignity, a pride naturally, ariſing from this ſenſe, and a diſpoſition to reſent and revenge every thing which is grating to our pride; this in many caſes is ſo far from a motive to virtue and reſtraint from vice, that it is itſelf a vice. Let this ſenſe of honour be ever ſo well limited and explained, it cannot be a motive to virtue and a reſtraint from vice to all men; becauſe it does not reach and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not influence all men. How many are there

in every nation and country, who have very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſenſe of their own dignity, and very little elevation of ſoul in a conſciouſneſs of it? How many are there, who in a proſpect of gain, would not ſcruple to betray their friends, to ſteal their neighbours property or to betray their country?</p>
            <p>IT is manifeſt therefore, that this philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal religion, could it be generally introduced and eſtabliſhed among us, would be a very great political evil, as it would weaken and even annihilate thoſe motives to virtue and reſtaints from vice, which are moſt powerful on the minds of men in general.</p>
            <p>BESIDES: this ſyſtem ſo far as it denies the evidence of the moral perfections of God, not only cuts off the motives to virtue, drawn from a future ſtate and from thoſe divine perfections; but even ſuggeſts motives to vice. If it be a matter of uncertainty, whether God be a friend to virtue or a friend to vice, it may be, that we ſhall pleaſe him moſt by an unreſtrained indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of vice, and by the practice of virtue ſhall provoke his malice and vengeance. Nay, if it be a matter of uncertainty, whether the Deity be a benevolent or malicious being, we can have no certainty, but that he will give us an exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in a future ſtate, on purpoſe to gratify his malevolence in our everlaſting torment. And to be conſiſtent, the advocates for the ſyſtem now under conſideration ſhould not ſay a word againſt the chriſtian doctrine of endleſs puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, on the ground of its ſuppoſed injuſtice or oppoſition to grace and mercy; becauſe they acknowledge, that they know not, that God is juſt, gracious or merciful.</p>

               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:026934_0012_0FD26CEEF8761618"/>
THUS this ſcheme, which was invented to avoid the fears of future puniſhment, defeats itſelf; and while it attempts to deliver us from a juſt puniſhment, leaves us expoſed to any puniſhment ever ſo unjuſt, cruel and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licious.</p>
            <p>As to that kind of infidelity, which allows the divine moral perfections and a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments; though this is more plauſible than the former; yet the motives to virtue and reſtraints from vice, which it af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords, are not to be compared with thoſe of the goſpel. Agreeably to the goſpel all men are to be rewarded according to their works done in the body, whether they be good or evil. Some are to be beaten with few ſtripes, ſome with many ſtripes, according to their ſeveral aggravations of guilt. But in the future pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment which infidels admit, there is nothing vindictive, nothing therefore which is intended to ſupport law and government. The only puniſhment which they admit, is that which is deſigned for the good of the perſon puniſhed;<note n="*" place="bottom">See Blount and Tyndal.</note> and therefore as ſoon as the perſon puniſhed repents, he is releaſed. Now it is manifeſt on the ſlighteſt reflection, that the motive to avoid ſin and vice on this plan, is exceedingly dimin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed from what it is on the plan of the goſpel. On the plan of the goſpel the motive is endleſs miſery, proportioned in degree to the demerit of the perſon puniſhed. On the infidel plan it is a merciful chaſtiſement, which is to contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue no longer than till the ſubject ſhall repent. And as every ſinner will naturally flatter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:026934_0013_0FD26CF06549E9E8"/>
that he ſhall repent as ſoon as he ſhall find his puniſhment to be intolerable; ſo all the pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, which on this plan he will expect, is one that ſhall continue but for a moment, after it ſhall have become extreme or intolerable. And whether this momentary extreme puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment be an equal reſtraint on vice, as the endleſs miſery threatened in the goſpel, let every man judge. It is plain, that in a comparative view it is as nothing. Therefore as even this, the moſt plauſible ſcheme of infidelity, cuts the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ews of morality and opens the flood-gates of vice; the prevalence of it in our ſtate would be a very great political evil.</p>
            <p>IF we take the pains to compare chriſtianity with antient paganiſm, we ſhall find, that the former has, even in a political view, the like advantage over the latter, which it has over in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity.—If in the account, which I ſhall now give of the pagan religion, ſome things ſhall be mentioned, which will be grating to thoſe of the moſt delicate feelings; I think I ſhall be entitled to the pardon of my hearers, as other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe it will be impoſſible for me to do juſtice to this important ſubject.</p>
            <p>PAGANISM, though it taught a future puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of wicked men of certain deſcriptions; yet indulged and even encouraged vice in a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of ways. It taught that there were many gods, ſome male and ſome female; ſome com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively good, others exceedingly evil; but all and even the chief god, on many occaſions acting a moſt wicked part and indulging the vileſt luſts. Some of their female deities were deceaſed women of moſt abandoned characters.

Jupiter, whom they called <hi>the father of gods and men,</hi> was himſelf the ſon of Saturn who accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ſome, was king of Crete; according to others, was Ham the ſon of Noah; according to others, was Adam; but on every hypotheſis was a mere man. This man, the antient hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens believed, had a number of children, and was wont to devour them as ſoon as they were born: but Jupiter was ſaved by an artifice of his mother. He, grown to maturity, rebelled againſt his father, who till then was ſuppoſed to be the ſupreme God, drove him from his throne, and ſeized his authority and dominions. When Jupiter had by theſe means raiſed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the place of ſupreme deity, he was wont to transform himſelf into various viſible ſhapes, to facilitate his deſigns of criminal intercourſe with women here on earth. Now how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive of the intereſts of virtue and morality muſt neceſſarily have been theſe ideas of the gods; and eſpecially theſe ideas of the charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and conduct of the ſupreme god, <hi>Jupiter the greateſt and the beſt!</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN like manner deſtructive to morality muſt have been almoſt all their other ideas of their gods; as of their animoſities and contentions among themſelves; of their intrigues and luſts<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the vicious and moſt abominable practices by which, in many inſtances, they were worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The goddeſs Venus was openly worſhipped by whoredom;<note n="*" place="bottom">Every woman among ſome nations was obliged, at leaſt once in her life, to proſtitute herſelf to any perſon, even the greateſt ſtranger, who would accept her favour. This done in honour to Venus.</note> and the feaſts called Saturna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia and Bacchinalia were celebrated by the prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026934_0015_0FD26CF362F80AA8"/>
of every lewdneſs and debauchery. The vices of drunkenneſs and whoredom in theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes were accounted, inſtead of moral evils, the higheſt acts of virtue and piety.</p>
            <p>Now as all theſe ideas and practices tended to a general depravity of morals; ſo their effects abundantly appeared in the vicious lives of the heathen world.</p>
            <p>I AM well aware, that it has been ſaid, that chriſtianity has depraved the morals of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; that vice is far more predominant among chriſtians, than ever it was among the antient heathens; and that therefore we may juſtly conclude, that chriſtianity is leſs ſubſervient to virtue and a moral life, than paganiſm. This has been urged as an argument againſt the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine original and the truth of chriſtianity; and may be urged as an argument againſt the good policy of encouraging and ſupporting it in any ſtate. The conſideration of this objection then is pertinent and neceſſary to the diſcuſſion of the ſubject now before us.</p>
            <p>IN anſwer to this objection I beg leave to obſerve in the firſt place, that if vice <hi>were</hi> more predominant in chriſtian nations, than it was among the heathens, it would not certainly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, that this increaſe of vice is the effect of chriſtianity. Chriſtianity prevails in civilized nations only; and in ſuch nations there is much more opportunity for many vices and much more temptation to them, than among thoſe who are not civilized. Nay, in civilized nations only, is there a poſſibility of the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of many vices. In proportion as civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zation
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026934_0016_0FD26CF59EC712F8"/>
is promoted, the wants of men are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed. Their food, their drink, their apparel and the education of their children, muſt be more expenſive, and more expence is in every reſpect required to their living in faſhion among their neighbours. And in proportion to the increaſe of their wants, the temptation to covetouſneſs, extortion, oppreſſion, deceit and fraud, is increaſed. Again, in proportion as civilization is promoted, the means of luxury of every kind are increaſed, and with the means, the temptations to luxury and luxury itſelf are increaſed. No wonder a ſavage, who wiſhes for nothing more than what he may take in hunting and fiſhing, and who has fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed himſelf with this, does not ſteal, rob or extort his neighbour's property; no wonder he attempts not to obtain it by falſehood or fraud. Nor is it any wonder, that living on ſuch a low and ſcanty diet as he generally does, he is very rarely guilty of a rape, of adultery or other lewdneſs. Nor ought it to be matter of wonder, that all theſe vices are far more prevalent in civilized nations, than among bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barians. But the prevalence of theſe vices in ſuch nations, is not owing to chriſtianity, but to civilization and its uſual attendants. They were at leaſt as prevalent among the antient Greeks and Romans, as they are among us. Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion does not uſually obtain among heathen, becauſe either they have no religion themſelves to inſtigate them to perſecution; or there is no religion different from their own, to be the object of their perſecution; or if there be a differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent religion, it makes no oppoſition to that which they have choſen, and therefore their religious zeal is not excited againſt it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:026934_0017_0FD26CF7A79DB940"/>
THIS affords an anſwer to an objection to chriſtianity much inſiſted on by ſome, that the heathens do not perſecute; but that chriſtians do moſt virulently perſecute even one another; and therefore that chriſtianity makes men worſe inſtead of better. The anſwer to this objection is, that the different religious ſentiments and forms of worſhip among the antient heathens did not in general oppoſe each other. They rather juſtified each other, as the heathens main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained an intercommunity of gods and religions. Though every nation had its own gods and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; yet whenever the individuals went into another nation, they joined in the worſhip of the gods and in the obſervance of the rites of the nation in which they then were. Therefore there was no opportunity for perſecution. But the nature of chriſtianity is very different. It condemns and oppoſes all other religions as falſe and ruinous. Therefore as it touches the pride of thoſe whom it condemns, it provokes oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition and the perſecution of itſelf, merely be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe it tells the truth. And the profeſſors of chriſtianity too, by a miſguided zeal, have been often led into the ſpirit and practice of perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>Now this perſecution of chriſtianity by thoſe of other religions, is not the effect of chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, but of oppoſition to it; and the perſecuting ſpirit which has appeared in ſome chriſtians, is not the effect of chriſtianity, but of the abuſe and perverſion of it; and for neither of theſe is chriſtianity itſelf anſwerable. The beſt inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the world may be oppoſed and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; and the beſt inſtitution in the world may be abuſed and perverted. But chriſtianity nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026934_0018_0FD26CF95E3AF7C8"/>
gave any juſt occaſion for either the perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or perverſion of itſelf.</p>
            <p>BESIDES, the charge of perſecution may juſtly be retorted. For no ſooner did chriſtianity make its appearance in the world, than it was violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly oppoſed and virulently perſecuted, by thoſe very heathens, who in the objection now before us are ſaid not to have been guilty of perſecution. And as long as they had the power in their hands, this oppoſition was continued or repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, under various Roman Emperors, for ten ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive and bloody perſecutions, in which thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and hundreds of thouſands were martyred in various ways, the moſt malicious and cruel.</p>
            <p>NAY, the heathens ſhowed a diſpoſition to perſecute not only chriſtians, but one another, whenever there was opportunity. No ſooner did Socrates oppoſe the religion and polytheiſm of his countrymen, than they began a perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of him, which ended in his death. And Cambyſes, the Perſian monarch, in contempt of the Egyptian god Apis, not only ſtabbed him with his dagger, but ordered the prieſts of Apis to be ſeverely whipped, and all the inhabitants of Memphis to be ſlain, who ſhould be found re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing on the occaſion of the appearance of that god.<note n="*" place="bottom">Prideaux's connection.</note> Theſe things demonſtrate, that the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient heathens did poſſeſs an high degree of the ſpirit of perſecution, and not only toward the chriſtians, but toward one another. The like ſpirit hath been manifeſted by heathens of mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern times. Paſſing other inſtances, I ſhall men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion one which took place in our own country.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:026934_0019_0FD26D0152F58018"/>
By the exertions of our anceſtors, the firſt Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean ſettlers of this country, a conſiderable number of the aborigines were converted to the chriſtian faith. The pagan Indians were diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed with this, baniſhed from their ſociety all the converts, and when they could do it with ſafety, put them to death, and would have maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacred them all, had they not been reſtrained by the fear of our anceſtors<note n="*" place="bottom">Neal's Hiſt. New-England.</note>.</p>
            <p>THE facts concerning Socrates and Cambyſes, furniſh an anſwer to that part of the objection under conſideration, which urges that chriſtians perſecute not only heathens, but one another; whereas heathens did not perſecute one another. It appears by the facts juſt mentioned, that hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens have perſecuted one another. Beſides, the ſame reaſon is to be aſſigned for chriſtians perſecuting one another, as for the heathens perſecuting chriſtians. The proteſtants ſay, that the religion of the papiſts is fundamentally wrong; on the other hand, the papiſts aſſert the ſame concerning the proteſtants. Thus by a mutual renunciation, condemnation and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>communication of each other, the falſe zeal of theſe and other different ſects among chriſtians is kindled into perſecution, on the ſame grounds on which perſecution is begun and carried on, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween chriſtians and heathens. But by reaſon of the forementioned intercommunity of gods and religions among the antient heathens, theſe grounds of perſecution did not exiſt among them in general, though in ſome caſes they did both exiſt and produce their uſual fruits.</p>
            <p>LET us now more directly attend to the charge
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:026934_0020_0FD26D040A1540C8"/>
brought againſt chriſtianity, that vice is more prevalent among chriſtians, than it was among the antient heathens.</p>
            <p>CHRISTIANS indeed have no virtue to be the ground of boaſting; on the other hand they have great reaſon to be aſhamed and humbled on account of their vices and their depravity of manners. Still I maintain, that open vice is not ſo prevalent in chriſtian nations, as it was among the antient heathens. Let us compare thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient heathens, of whom we know the moſt and who were the moſt improved and polite, with the chriſtians of whom we know the moſt; the antient Greeks and Romans with the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of the United States.</p>
            <p>HERE it is to be obſerved, that we labour un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der great diſadvantage. We know our own country and its predominant vices, both public and private. In order to this we need but open our eyes and look around us. We have not the ſame advantage to know the antients. We are entirely dependent on hiſtory for information concerning them and their vices; and this gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally relates the public tranſactions of nations on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as their wars and treaties, their laws and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic judgments; but is moſtly ſilent concerning the morals and private lives of individuals or of the people conſidered collectively; and ſo far as we are ignorant of the antients we have no right to charge them with vice. However, with all this diſadvantage, I fear not to proceed to the compariſon.</p>
            <p>LET us then inſtitute the compariſon with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to the principal moral virtues, as tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, chaſtity, truth, juſtice and humanity.</p>

1. As to temperance; though this was reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned among the virtues by the pagan moral writers, yet it is plain from their writers in gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral, that drunkenneſs was exceedingly common among them, and among all ranks, among ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates, philoſophers and prieſts, as well as oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Their prieſts in ſome of their religious feaſts were always intoxicated. Even Cato, though a Stoic philoſopher, one of their ſtrict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt moraliſts and a principal magiſtrate, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably addicted to this vice. So was Zeno, the founder of the ſect of the Stoics; and Chry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſippus, another Stoic philoſopher died in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of exceſſive drinking at a ſacrifice.<note n="*" place="bottom">Prieſtley's Inſtitutes.</note> The character of their principal magiſtrates, prieſts and philoſophers, does not appear to have ſuffered much, if at all, by this vice. It muſt therefore have been conſidered by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as a very venial fault, if any at all. Indeed this is evident by all their writers. But how it is eſteemed among us, and what would be the effect of it on the reputation of our principal ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates and divines, I need not inform you.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to chaſtity, it is manifeſt from the whole current of pagan writers, that they conſidered fornication as no crime, and therefore ran into it without reſerve. Not only is this obſervable of Homer's heroes, but even the modeſt Virgil's pious Eneas, who was meant to be a perfect character, had an amour with Dido, without the leaſt ſhame or ſenſe of indecency. Simple fornication was not only commonly practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed without reſtraint; but was allowed by all their philoſophers, and was poſitively encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:026934_0022_0FD26D0735D1C178"/>
by ſome of them.<note n="*" place="bottom">"None of the philoſophers ever repreſented ſimple forni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, eſpecially on the part of the man, as any vice at all. Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to commended a young man for frequenting the public ſtews; and Cicero expreſsly ſpeaks of it, as a thing that was never found fault with." <hi>Prieſtley's Inſtitutes.</hi> All that was enjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Epictetus, who of all the philoſophers, is perhaps the moſt celebrated for his ſtrict maxims of morality, was, "that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhould abſtain from fornication before marriage as far as they could; and that if they did not abſtain, they ſhould uſe it lawfully, and not be ſevere in reprehending thoſe who did not abſtain." Enchiridion, Chap. 47.</note> Many of the cuſtoms of the Greeks and Romans promoted lewdneſs. The manner of the appearance of women in ſome of their public exerciſes, was ſuch as directly ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to that vice; and the ideas of the lawful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and expediency of a community of wives ſo far prevailed and had ſuch an influence on practice, as not only implied the violation of chaſtity, but had a moſt baleful general tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy with reſpect to that virtue.<note n="†" place="bottom">"At Sparta, young women appeared naked in the public exerciſes; and when married women had no children, their huſbands were encouraged to conſent to a free intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and other men; a cuſtom which Plutarch vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates. This was alſo agreeable to the doctrine of the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ics; and it is well known, that that rigid Stoic, Cato of Utica, conſented to ſuch an intercourſe between his own wife and his friend Hortenſius. Plato in his book of laws, recommends a community of women; and he adviſes, that ſoldiers be not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained with reſpect to any kind of ſinful indulgence, even the moſt unnatural ſpecies of it, when they are on an expedition, <hi>Prieſtly.</hi>
               </note> Though it is hardly credible, yet unnatural vices had too much the ſanction of ſome legiſlators and philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophers, and were countenanced by many of them. Xenophon informs us, that the ſin of Sodom was encouraged by the public laws of ſeveral of the ſtates of Greece. It was more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſo among the Cretans, in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent too great an increaſe of the people. Solon, one of the ſeven wiſe men of Greece, and the celebrated law-giver of Athens, forbad this prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:026934_0023_0FD26D08611EE990"/>
to ſlaves, which neceſſarily conveys the idea of his thinking it fit for free men only. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to Cicero, the Greek philoſophers not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly generally practiſed, but even gloried in this vice: And Plutarch informs us, that many parents would not ſuffer their children to keep the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of thoſe philoſophers, who pretended to be fond of them. Diogenes was remarkable for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulging himſelf in the moſt abominable practices openly, and without a ſenſe of ſhame; affecting, according to the maxim of the Cynics, to live according to nature.<note n="*" place="bottom">Does not the forementioned deiſtic maxim of following nature, directly lead to the ſame abominable practices?</note> Theſe unnatural vices were increaſed in a moſt aſtoniſhing manner, about the time of the promulgation of chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Seneca ſays, that in his time they were practiſed openly and without ſhame at Rome."<note n="†" place="bottom">Prieſtly.</note> Theſe accounts given by heathen writers, fully juſtify the charges thrown out on this head againſt the heathens, by the writers of the New Teſtament, eſpecially by the apoſtle Paul, in his firſt chapter to the Romans: Though to chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians the inſpired writers need no authority, but do of themſelves ſufficiently prove the amazing depravity of the heathen world in this reſpect.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Truth is a moral virtue, the obligation and neceſſity of which are perhaps as evident as thoſe of any virtue whatever. Yet the Stoic philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phers taught that lying was lawful, whenever it was profitable; and Plato allowed, that a man may lie, who knows how to do it at a proper time.</p>
            <p n="4">4. LET us inquire how far juſtice was main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:026934_0024_0FD26D0B2A6EA3F0"/>
and practiſed among the antients. I now mean juſtice in matters of property. For that kind of juſtice which is oppoſed to oppreſſion and cruelty, will come into view, when we ſhall conſider the humanity of the antients. It is well known to have been a maxim at Sparta, that probity and every thing elſe was to be ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed to the good of the ſtate. The Spartans encouraged their children to ſteal, but puniſhed thoſe who were taken in the fact, as not being dextrous in the buſineſs. "We may judge of the ſtate of Greece, with reſpect to the kind of juſtice of which we are now ſpeaking, from that paſſage in a dialogue of Xenophon—in which he humourouſly ſhows the advantages of poverty and the inconveniencies of riches; and by what Tacitus ſays, that the temples were full of debt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors and criminals, as churches and monaſteries uſed formerly to be in Popiſh countries. Rome and the neighbourhood of it, in the moſt intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing period of its hiſtory, <abbr>viz.</abbr> in the time of Cice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ro, abounded with robbers. Salluſt ſays, that Cataline's army was much augmented by the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion of highwaymen about Rome. Cicero obſerved, that had Milo killed Clodius by night, it might have been imagined, that he had been killed by highwaymen, and that the frequency of ſuch accidents would have favoured the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, though he had with him thirty ſlaves completely armed and accuſtomed to blood and danger. By the law of the twelve tables, poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion for two years formed a preſcription for land, and of one year for moveables; an evident mark of frequent violences, when ſuch a law was neceſſary to ſecure a title to property."<note n="*" place="bottom">Prieſtley's letters on general policy.</note> How
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:026934_0025_0FD26D0DD7A5DD10"/>
different our ſituation is from this, and how much more ſecure our perſons and property are, I need not mention in this auditory.</p>
            <p n="5">5. WE proceed now to inquire how far the antient heathens practiſed the duties of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and how far they violated thoſe duties by outrage, oppreſſion and cruelty. The Stoics condemned all compaſſion. No wonder then that they imbibed and practiſed inhumanity. Some philoſophers, particularly Democritus, recommended revenge; and Plato owns that for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of injuries was contrary to the general doctrine of the philoſophers. Theſe ideas ſeem perfectly to coincide with thoſe among the mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erns, who are the great advocates for a ſenſe of honour.

            <p>IT was common with the Romans to make war on other nations for the end of enlarging their own dominions, and aggrandizing their empire. Generally they had no better motive to their wars than this. But what is ſuch a war, but a complication of downright robbery, cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty and murder? They practiſed equal injuſtice in the manner in which they carried on their wars. They enſlaved their captives or put them to death in cold blood, as they pleaſed. Their triumphs were moſt oppreſſive and cruel. The conquered kings and generals, loaded with chains, were driven into the city, and to the capitol before their conquerors, and were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by mimicks and buffoons, who inſulted over their misfortunes. When they arrived at the forum, they were led back to priſon and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:026934_0026_0FD26D126FC2BAF8"/>
there ſtrangled; and this under the pretence of taking full revenge of their enemies. What better is this, than the treatment which our ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age Indians give their captives?</p>
            <p>THE treatment which they gave thoſe cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives whoſe lives they ſpared, was correſpondent to this cruelty toward thoſe whom they put to death. As has been obſerved, they abſolutely enſlaved them; and by law, ſlaves were confid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not as men, but as mere things, the mere property of their maſters, and were treated, puniſhed, and put to death at any time and in any manner, as their maſters pleaſed, whether by beating, ſtarving, torture, or otherwiſe. "The Spartans having conquered a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nation, the Helots, enſlaved them, frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly butchered them in cold blood, and applau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded their youths, when they killed them by ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe." "The Romans were not aſhamed to ſuffer their old and uſeleſs ſlaves, when worn out in their ſervice, to ſtarve on an iſland in the Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, as was their common practice. Vidius Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lio uſed to throw his ſlaves, who had diſobliged him, into his fiſh ponds, to be preyed upon by his mullets."<note n="*" place="bottom">Prieſtly.</note>

            <p>THOUGH to our ſhame, to the ſhame of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and the ſcandal of chriſtianity, a ſlavery and a treatment of ſlaves ſimilar to what exiſted among the Romans, exiſt and are tolerated in ſome parts of America; yet this ſcandal cannot be thrown on chriſtendom in general. Such a ſlavery did indeed once generally obtain in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; but the benevolent and humane ſpirit of the goſpel and the principles of juſtice taught
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026934_0027_0FD26D149E9D8A28"/>
there, have long ſince generally aboliſhed it from that quarter of the world.</p>
            <p>THE proſcriptions and aſſaſſinations, which were ſo common among the antients, are a fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proof of their injuſtice, violence and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. It is well known that during the conteſts of Marius and Sylla, and during the triumvirate of Octavianus, Anthony and Lepidus, nothing was more common than to advertiſe a certain price for any man's or any number of men's heads; which was no other than hiring any cut-throat, and even a man's own domeſtics, to murder him and bring in his head. In this way the beſt men of Rome were murdered, and among the reſt Cicero the great orator, philoſopher and ornament of Rome. Amidſt all the vices juſtly imputable to chriſtians, they are not guilty of ſuch barbarity and outrage as this. Such is the ſalutary influence of chriſtianity, that even kings, who among the antients no ſooner fell into the hands of their rivals or oppoſers, than they were aſſaſſinated, are now not put to death without a formal trial; which is a clear demonſtration among many others, of our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in civilization and humanity, beyond any thing which exiſted among the moſt enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened heathens.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER inſtance of the barbarity and inhu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity of the antients, is their treatment of their children. "The antient Roman laws gave the father a power of life and death over his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, upon this principle, that he who gave, had alſo the power to take away. And a ſon could not acquire any property of his own du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the life of his father; but all his acquiſitions
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:026934_0028_0FD26D182CDB0C28"/>
belonged to his father, or at leaſt the profits, for life."<note n="*" place="bottom">Blackſtone.</note> Thus children, during the life of their fathers, were perfect ſlaves, and in a worſe condition than the ſlaves in this ſtate; for the maſter in this ſtate has not the power of life and death over his ſlaves. Nor were theſe mere ſpeculations of the Romans; but their practice was correſpondent. Hence the cuſtom of expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing children; that is, of laying them, as ſoon as born, in the ſtreets, on the banks of rivers, or in other frequented places, and unleſs ſome compaſſionate perſon ſhould take them up and provide for them, leaving them there to periſh and to be devoured by dogs. The motive to this horrid practice was, that the parents might be free from the trouble and expence of their education. Both Plato and Ariſtotle ſay, that there ſhould be laws to prevent the education of weak children. Accordingly among the other Greeks, beſide the Thebans, when a child was born, it was laid on the ground, and if the fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er deſigned to educate it, he immediately took it up. But if he forbore to do this, the child was carried away and expoſed. The Lacede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monians indeed had a different cuſtom; for with them all new born children were brought before certain triers, who were ſome of the graveſt men in their own tribes, by whom the infants were carefully viewed; and if they were found luſty and well favoured, they gave orders for their education; but if weakly and deform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, they ordered them to be caſt into a deep ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern in the earth, near the mountain Taygetus, as thinking it neither for the good of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren nor for the public intereſt, that defective children ſhould be brought up. It was the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy

            </p>
            <p>IN ſeveral nations, not only infants, but alſo the aged and the infirm, were expoſed and left to periſh.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER horrid inhumanity, prevalent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the antient heathens, was the practice of ſacrificing captives and ſlaves at the funerals of the dead. Thus Achilles ſacrificed twelve young Trojans to the manes of Patroclus; and Eneas ſent captives to Evander, to be ſacrificed at the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral of Pallas. This was firſt practiſed with reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect to perſons of great eminence only, but at length it was done at the funerals of all perſons of property, and became a neceſſary part of the ceremony.</p>
            <p>ANOTHER practice as horrid as any I have mentioned, was that of exhibiting gladiators trained to fencing and the uſe of the ſword, ſpear, &amp;c. on purpoſe that they might fight and kill one another on the ſtage, for the mere entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the ſpectators, as ſome people now bait bulls and ſet dogs to fighting. "Theſe poor wretches were made to ſwear that they would fight unto death; and if they failed of this, they were put to death by fire or ſword, clubs, whips, or the like,"<note n="†" place="bottom">Chambers Dictionary.</note> "Thoſe who have not attended to hiſtory, are apt to imagine, that the exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of gladiators was a rare thing, and that when it happened, a few pairs only were engag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. But it was far otherwiſe. Under the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man emperors this inhuman entertainment coſt

innumerable lives. Ceſar when Edile, gave three hundred and twenty gladiators. Gordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an in the time of his Edileſhip, exhibited twelve entertainments, that is, one in each month. In ſome of theſe were five hundred champions, and in none of them leſs than one hundred and fifty. Taking it at a medium, he muſt have exhibited at the very leaſt, three thouſand. Titus exhibited theſe cruel ſhows for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred days together. The good and moderate Trajan continued theſe ſpectacles for an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty three days; and in that time gave ten thouſand. When we conſider how many different ranks of people gave theſe enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainments, Ediles, Pretors, Queſtors, Conſuls, Emperors and Prieſts, beſides private perſons at funerals (which become ſo common a prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that it was an article in a laſt will) we muſt be convinced, that the numbers were vaſt. What adds to the inhumanity of this cuſtom, is, that it was deſigned for a gay entertainment and was attended as ſuch. This horrible cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom grew to ſuch an extravagance, that it was found neceſſary to moderate it by law, in the time of the heathen Emperors. Conſtantine firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited it altogether. But ſo violent was the taſte for it, that it crept in again.

            <p>I SHALL take notice of only one more vice of the antient heathens, that is <hi>ſuicide.</hi> This was recommended by many philoſophers, as an he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roic act of virtue, and was practiſed by ſome of the higheſt fame, as by Zeno the founder of the ſect of the Stoics, by Cato of Utica, and by Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus. No wonder if under ſuch inſtructors and
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:026934_0031_0FD26D1E03AE6200"/>
ſuch examples, ſuicide was very common among the antients. Beſide the wickedneſs of this in the ſight of God, the ruinous tendency of it in a political view is manifeſt on the ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt reflection. By this one vice not only any man may deprive the ſtate of his aid and throw his family and dependents on the public; but the moſt important citizens, by throwing away their own lives in the moſt important and criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal moment, may greatly endanger and entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overthrow the commonwealth. What if our <hi>Waſhington,</hi> or the moſt wiſe and influential mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our Congreſs, had deſtroyed themſelves in the moſt critical periods of the late war?</p>
            <p>FROM this brief ſurvey of the vices of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient heathens, I leave my hearers to judge how well founded the objection againſt chriſtianity is, that it has depraved the morals of mankind.</p>
            <p>I HAVE now finiſhed the obſervations which I intended, on the ſubject propoſed, which was, The neceſſity of a belief of chriſtianity by the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens of this ſtate, in order to our public and political proſperity. In ſubſerviency to this general deſign I have endeavoured to ſhow, that ſome religion is neceſſary to our political proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity; that no other religion than the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian, can be generally received and eſtabliſhed in this country; and that if ſome other religion could be eſtabliſhed among us, it would by no means be ſo uſeful in a political view, as the chriſtian. I have endeavoured to illuſtrate the laſt obſervation by a compariſon of chriſtianity with the philoſophical religion of infidelity and with antient paganiſm. I now beg leave to make two or three inferences from what has been ſaid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:026934_0032_0FD26D2151FD9F10"/>
I. IF chriſtianity be more uſeful than any other religion, even for political purpoſes, we may preſume that it is ſtill more uſeful for the other purpoſes, which are indeed its immediate objects, piety and true virtue, and peace and comfort in them. The great foundations of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and virtue are, the moral perfections of God, his moral government, the rule of our du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a future ſtate of retribution, the poſſibility of pardon and the end of our creation. Let us in theſe ſeveral particulars compare chriſtianity with the philoſophical religion, which is the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rival of chriſtianity with any among us.</p>
            <p n="1">1. AS to the moral perfections of God, chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity certainly teaches them more clearly than they can be learnt from any light afforded by the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical religion. The ſcriptures aſſure us, that holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hoſts; that he is a God of truth and without iniquity, juſt and right is he; that he is the Lord, the Lord God mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful and gracious, long ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth, keeping mercy for thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, forgiving iniquity and tranſgreſſion and ſin, and that will by no means clear the guilty. Yea, they aſſure us, that God is love. They clear up the difficulty ariſing from the evil in the world, by informing us of the end of all things, and that all things ſhall finally be overrul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for good. But the philoſophical religion gives no clear evidence at all of the moral perfections of God. This is acknowledged by ſome of the principal writers on that ſyſtem. <hi>Hume,</hi> the moſt acute of all infidels, ſays we ought to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer from the works of God, intermixed as they are with good and evil, that God is of a mixed
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:026934_0033_0FD26D24B49E8CF0"/>
character, partly good and partly evil. Alſo Lord Bolingbroke, another principal deiſtical writer, holds, that there is no evidence of the moral perfections of God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE like advantage have we by the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as to the evidence of the reality and nature of the moral government of God. On the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that we are under the influence of a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of coaction, it is denied by ſome infidels that we are moral agents, and that we are ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of either virtue or vice. Now not only is this matter cleared up by revelation, but it is to be obſerved, that to be conſiſtent, ſuch infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels ought alſo to deny, that we are capable of any crime in civil ſociety.</p>
            <p>IF we be not moral agents, we are no more capable of murder, than a ſtock or a ſtone; and a man who from malice prepenſe kills another, no more deſerves puniſhment, than the ſtone or the tree, which falls on a man and cruſhes him to death; and the man who from a wiſh to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce and eſtabliſh arbitrary government in his country, now a free and happy republic, betrays its ſhips and fortreſſes, no more deſerves puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, than the tempeſts which ſink the former, or the fire which conſumes the latter.</p>
            <p>SOME deny, that God at all concerns himſelf with human affairs or actions. But this is not only not reconcileable with the ſcriptures, but not with the moral perfections of God. If we be capable of virtue, and yet he neglect us, ſo as not to ſet before us proper motives to it, and not to ſhow by proper rewards and puniſhments his approbation of the virtuous, and diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:026934_0034_0FD26D26628ED510"/>
of the vicious; this cannot be reconciled with his moral perfection.</p>
            <p>IT is further urged, that we are not in any caſe puniſhable, as all things are right, or as the poet expreſſes it, <hi>whatever is, is right.</hi> If by this obſervation be meant, that things are by the all-wiſe and all-governing providence of God, overruled to anſwer a good purpoſe, though in many inſtances directly contrary to their natural tendency; this is granted. But if it be meant, that all things in their own nature tend to good, this is not true. Malice has no natural tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to good but a natural tendency to evil. On the other hand, benevolence has a natural ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency to good. Nor will it be pretended, that if malice reigned through the univerſe, the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe would be as happy, as if benevolence univerſally reigned. It is the natural tendency of a rational action, which determines its moral quality, and not the conſequence produced by Almighty God, contrary to its natural tendency.</p>
            <p>IF all human actions were in a moral view indifferent, we ſhould no more deſerve puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for murder, than we ſhould for ſaving our country from ruin.</p>
            <p>THIS ſcheme ſhuts all moral <hi>good</hi> out of the univerſe, as well as all moral evil. For if all the tempers and actions of men, are as to mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality alike, it muſt be becauſe there is no mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality in any of them. If there be moral good in any of thoſe tempers or actions, there muſt be moral evil in the directly oppoſite; and if there be no moral evil in the latter, there is no moral good in the former: as if there were no
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:026934_0035_0FD26D2964595BE0"/>
natural evil in pain there would be no na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural good in pleaſure.</p>
            <p>BUT while infidels confound themſelves and the principles of reaſon, in their diſcourſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the moral government of God; the ſcriptures aſſure us of the reality of that govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of our accountableneſs to God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE ſcriptures give us a plain and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent rule of duty, pointing out our duty not only in general, but in all the moſt important particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars. How extremely deficient in this inſtance alſo, is the philoſophical religion? It is indeed ſaid, that the rule of our duty is right reaſon and the law of nature, and that virtue is a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to them. But this is ſaying no more than that virtue is virtue, and that the rule of our duty is the rule of our duty. For right reaſon in this caſe means what is reaſonable and right in a moral ſenſe; and duty and what is right in a moral ſenſe are the ſame thing: and it is juſt as difficult to find out the law of reaſon and of nature, as to find out our duty.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE ſcriptures give us the moſt poſitive aſſurance of a future ſtate. But the philoſophi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal religion can never aſſure us of this, becauſe it cannot aſſure us of the moral perfections of God, by which alone he is diſpoſed to reward the righteous and puniſh the wicked. Therefore in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels are greatly divided among themſelves on this ſubject. Some as was before obſerved be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve a future ſtate, ſome diſbelieve it. Thoſe who believe ſuch a ſtate, believe that God made all men for their own perſonal happineſs, and that therefore he will make them all happy in
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:026934_0036_0FD26D2F05D28638"/>
the future world. But all this depends on the moral perfections of God, of which they, as their principal writers confeſs, have no evidence. And if there be no evidence of God's moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, there is no evidence, that he deſigns the happineſs of his creatures either here or hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: nor is there any evidence but that he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns the final <hi>miſery</hi> of all his creatures.—Or if infidels had evidence of the moral perfections of God, they would not have evidence, that God made every man for the end of his perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al happineſs. The perfect goodneſs of God doubtleſs implies, that he made all things with a deſign to promote good on the whole or on the large ſcale. So that taking the ſyſtem of intelligent creatures together, there ſhall be the greateſt poſſible happineſs in it. But this does not imply, that every individual creature ſhall be completely happy. There is no account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the calamities and ſufferings of this life on any other ſuppoſition, than that they will all finally iſſue in the greateſt happineſs of the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem: and to ſuppoſe that they conduce to the good of the ſyſtem, by making the perſons them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves who ſuffer them here, more happy hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, is a mere conjecture unſuppored by any ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument. Therefore to indulge it and to build upon it, is altogether unreaſonable and unphi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophical.</p>
            <p>ON the whole, there is no evidence but that the good of the general ſyſtem may be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the exemplary puniſhment of the wicked in the future world. And if it would be promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſuch a puniſhment, infinite goodneſs not only admits of it, but requires and demands it.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:026934_0037_0FD26D32EF8786B8"/>
5. THE ſcriptures aſſure us of a way of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don and acceptance with God; but the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical religion gives no ſuch aſſurance. Infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels do indeed expect to be pardoned on their bare repentance. But the expectation of <hi>pardon</hi> on repentance, implies an acknowledgment, that they deſerve puniſhment even though they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and that ſuch puniſhment would be juſt: otherwiſe there could be no <hi>pardon</hi> in the caſe. To pardon is to exempt from puniſhment not an innocent man, but a guilty one: and to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don a penitent implies that he deſerves puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that his puniſhment would be juſt. But if the puniſhment of the penitent would be juſt, the intereſt of the kingdom of God, the great community againſt which he has ſinned, requires his puniſhment. The very idea of a juſt puniſhment is of one which, (there being no atonement or ſubſtitution,) is due to the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or to the public good of the community, againſt which the crime puniſhed was commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. But if the public good of God's kingdom, which is the univerſe, require the puniſhment of the ſinner, it is not conſiſtent with divine goodneſs to pardon him. What ground then has the infidel to expect pardon, when both juſtice and goodneſs require his puniſhment?</p>
            <p n="6">6. CHRISTIANITY informs us of the end of our creation. It is generally holden by infidels, as was before obſerved, that we were made for our own perſonal happineſs. But if this were true, it would prove, that God does concern himſelf with human actions, and that he aims to prevent thoſe which tend to our deſtruction. It would alſo prove, that thoſe rational actions which tend to deſtroy our happineſs, are mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:026934_0038_0FD26D34B94D2C98"/>
evil, and that all actions are not in the ſame ſenſe right. The evidence that God created us for our own happineſs, muſt depend on the evidence of God's moral perfections. But as has been obſerved, the infidel has no evidence of theſe. Beſides, if God really created us all for the end of our own perſonal happineſs, it ſeems that he has in this world obtained his end, in a very imperfect degree only; and on the plan of infidelity there is no evidence of a future ſtate. Therefore on that plan there is no evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that God will ever obtain his end in our creation.</p>
            <p>OR if infidels ſhould grant, that we were made for the general good of the ſyſtem of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligences, this would be to give up the chief object of infidelity; becauſe the general good may admit of our miſery in the future world, as it does of our miſery in this.</p>
            <p>BUT chriſtianity clearly informs us, that God made all things for his glory, implying the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt happineſs and perfection of the creation as a ſyſtem; or for the glorious exerciſe and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of his power, wiſdom and goodneſs in raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his kingdom, which is the creation, as a ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, to the higheſt degree of perfection and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
            <p>THUS we ſee in what darkneſs, as to the moſt eſſential principles of religion, we ſhould have been involved, had we not been favoured with the light of divine revelation, and in what dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs they are involved, who embrace the philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophical religion of infidelity. And thus we have further proof how happy that people is,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:026934_0039_0FD26D362BA47858"/>
whoſe God is the Lord, not only as this cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance lays a foundation for their political good, but eſpecially as it lays a foundation for true virtue and piety, for peace and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort here and eternal happineſs in the favour of God hereafter.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A SECOND inference from this ſubject is, that ſince chriſtianity appears to be neceſſary to the public good of the ſtate, it ought to be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by magiſtrates and rulers of every deſcription. They are appointed to be the guardians of the public good; of courſe it is their duty to protect and promote every thing tending to it, and eſpecially every thing neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to it. Therefore as chriſtianity is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the public good, they are bound to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, promote and inculcate that, by their exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and profeſſion, by ſpeaking and acting in favour of it both in public and private, by ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting chriſtian ordinances and worſhip, and by promoting to places of truſt and profit thoſe who profeſs it and live agreeably, and who are otherwiſe properly qualified. Magiſtrates are called to do all this on the ground of the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt policy.</p>
            <p n="3">3. FOR the ſame reaſons the citizens in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral are obligated to encourage and promote chriſtianity, by being themſelves chriſtians and that not only in profeſſion, but in heart and life, and by giving their ſuffrages for thoſe who are of the ſame character. It is indeed to be confeſſed, that not all profeſſed chriſtians are good men or real chriſtians; yet among pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed chriſtians are many men, who poſſeſs good abilities and a proper ſhare of informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:026934_0040_0FD26D379F2937F8"/>
who are ſtrictly moral and upright, and who expect to give an account of their conduct to God. Such are the men to be promoted in the ſtate; and the citizens by promoting ſuch men, will encourage and promote chriſtianity, and at the ſame time promote the good of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>I BEG the further patience of the auditory, while I cloſe the diſcourſe, with the addreſſes uſual on this occaſion.</p>

               <p>IN obedience to your command I appear in the deſk this day; and I could think of no ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject more important and at the ſame time more ſuitable to the preſent occaſion, than the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of that people whoſe God is the LORD. I have therefore endeavoured to illuſtrate the neceſſity of the chriſtian faith and practice, to the proſperity of the ſtate. I may appeal to your Excellency how far this faith and practice have hitherto contributed to our political proſperity. Had not our anceſtors been firm and exempla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in this faith and practice; had they not ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken pains to hand them down to us; had they not in all their towns and ſettlements inſtituted ſchools, in which the principles of chriſtianity, as well as other things were taught; had they not provided for the ſupport of public worſhip, for the due obſervance of the Lord's day and for the public teaching of chriſtianity on that day; had they not provided for the ſupport

of a ſtudious and learned miniſtry, who being themſelves men of knowledge, ſhould be able to inſtruct others; I appeal to your Excellen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, whether our political affairs would not at preſent have worn a very different aſpect. And if our ſupreme magiſtrates had not been, both by profeſſion and apparent practice, chriſtians, it would doubtleſs have had a very baleful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence on the chriſtian and moral character of the people at large, and conſequently on our political proſperity. But we are happy in that we have had from the beginning, even to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent day, a ſeries of Governors, who have been not only an honour to the ſtate, but ornaments to our churches. May ſuch a ſeries be ſtill kept up without interruption. This, as it will be a proof of our chriſtian character, will alſo be a proof of our public proſperity in every ſucceſſive period, and a pledge of our ſubſequent proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. May God grant, that your Excellency ſhall effectually contribute to this proſperity in every way, in which your eminent ſituation affords opportunity. And when earthly ſtates and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires ſhall be no more, may your Excellency, in that ſeries of excellent men and excellent Governors, and among all real chriſtians, "ſhine forth as the ſun in the kingdom of your Father."</p>

               <p>SINCE the belief and practice of chriſtianity are ſo neceſſary to the political good of our ſtate,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:026934_0042_0FD26D3CC2604AA8"/>
and ſince you are appointed to be the guardians of our political good, I thought it not imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent to ſuggeſt to you ſome important means, by which you may obtain the end for which you are appointed. Oppoſition to chriſtianity both in faith and practice was never, at leaſt in our country, ſo great and ſo increaſing, as at the preſent day. It lies with you, gentlemen, by a ſteady belief, profeſſion and practice of chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity; by your converſation and weight; by the appointments which you ſhall make to the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous offices, civil and military, and by all your public proceedings, to withſtand this oppoſition, and to guard againſt the danger to the public good, ariſing from the depravity of manners which oppoſition to chriſtianity naturally indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. It is your province, in conjunction with his Excellency the Governour, to appoint all our executive civil authority and to confer the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er military honours. When men of licentious principles and practice are promoted either in the civil or military line, it gives a dignity and an influence to vice and irreligion. And "one ſinner deſtroys much good," eſpecially when ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted to a high ſtation of honour and authority. Now, if you give this advantage to vice, you will thereby injure the ſtate; but more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately you will injure religion and the kingdom of Chriſt. And let me beſeech you to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, that you alſo have a maſter in heaven, to whom you, as well as the reſt of men, muſt give an account. The only way to gain his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation is, to keep a conſcience void of offence, and in your political tranſactions not to act from party attachments and private connections, not to practice intrigue to ſerve your own inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſts or thoſe of your friends; but to endeav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:026934_0043_0FD26D3F620E8568"/>
to ſerve the public in the beſt manner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to your capacity and opportunity. In ſo doing you will appoint to the ſeveral execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive offices, men of knowledge and diſcretion; men that fear God and hate covetouſneſs; men who will be juſt and rule in the fear of God. By the promotion of ſuch men, virtue will be encouraged and vice will be reſtrained; by their official proceedings, law and juſtice will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecuted, and "judgment will run down as wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, and righteouſneſs as a mighty ſtream," even that righteouſneſs which exalteth a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."

               <p>WE who are employed in the work of the miniſtry, are deeply intereſted in this ſubject. We are intereſted in the proſperity of the ſtate, and are peculiarly intereſted in this mean of proſperity on which I have been inſiſting. It is our buſineſs to ſtudy and teach chriſtianity, and thus to promote the political good of the ſtate, as well as the ſpiritual good of the ſouls of our hearers. This is a noble employment, to fidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and zeal in which, not only the motives of religion call us, but even thoſe of patriotiſm. Therefore if we have any love to religion and the ſouls of men; nay if we have any public ſpirit and love to our country, let us diligently ſtudy the evidences, the nature, the doctrines
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:026934_0044_0FD26D423927D218"/>
and duties of chriſtianity, and inculcate them with all plainneſs, aſſiduity and perſeverance, giving line upon line and precept upon precept. This is to be done,</p>
               <p n="1">1. BY inſtruction. Without communicating inſtruction and information concerning the truth, we can expect to do nothing in our work to any good purpoſe. Knowledge and not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance is the mother of real devotion. The rational mind is to be led by the exhibition of the truth only.</p>
               <p n="2">2. BY every motive to perſuade, drawn from reaſon and revelation, from time and eternity; and among others this motive of the public good of the ſtate and our general happineſs, liberty and proſperity as a people, is not to be omitted.</p>
               <p n="3">3. BY a chriſtian life and converſation. If we do theſe things; if we thus inſtruct, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade and live, we ſhall at laſt ſtand in our lot, and ſhall be owned as his, when Chriſt our Lord and judge "ſhall make up his jewels."</p>
               <p n="4">4. I SHALL, in the laſt place, addreſs myſelf in a very few words to this numerous auditory collectively. Men and brethren, this ſubject nearly concerns you all. How happy would you be, if the Lord were indeed your God? Nor can you be truly happy on any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. However proſperous you may be in your private concerns, in your property, your buſineſs and your reputation; yet unleſs you are the objects of the favour of God and the heirs of eternal life, you are truly in a miſerable
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:026934_0045_0FD26D4470930F00"/>
ſituation. You have not only the motive of eternal happineſs to chooſe the Lord for your God; but the motives of the peace, good order, and happineſs of the people as a body politic, and the general proſperity of the ſtate. You all feel a firm attachment to your liberties and to the priv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ileges of a republican government. Of all forms of government a republic moſt eſſentially re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires virtue and good morals in the great body of the people, in order to its proſperity and even its exiſtence. But the way to virtue and good morals is to chooſe the Lord for your God. Nor is this all; you not only have to chooſe and ſerve the Lord yourſelves, but by the ſame reaſons by which you are obligated to chooſe the Lord for your God, you are obligated to ſeek out and by your ſuffrages to promote to legiſlative authority, ſuch as are of the ſame character. In a republic all authority is derived from the people: and ſuch as they generally are, we may expect their repreſentatives, legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lators and all their civil authority will be. If you have the Lord for your God, you will elect thoſe of the ſame character with yourſelves, to to be your legiſlators; you will encourage and ſupport them and other faithful rulers in the thorough diſcharge of their duties of civil gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment, and you will withhold your ſuffrages from thoſe who acknowledge not the Lord as their God and regard not his law. Nor can you conſiſtently and innocently give your ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages to men of this laſt diſcription: for thus you would give a ſanction and influence to ſin and vice, would be partakers of their wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and would do an injury to the ſtate.</p>
               <p>BUT if you and the good people of the ſtate
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:026934_0046_0FD26D48E0415EB8"/>
in general ſhall unite to practiſe virtue and chriſtianity, and to promote the wiſeſt and beſt men among us, we ſhall doubtleſs be that happy people deſcribed in the text, and as ſo many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of our happineſs "judgment ſhall dwell in the wilderneſs and righteouſneſs remain in the fruitful field. And the work of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhall be peace, and the effect of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs quietneſs and aſſurance for ever."</p>
