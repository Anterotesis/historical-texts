            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE candid reception of a ſmall volume of Inquiries and Obſervations, publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the year 1788, has encouraged me to offer a ſecond to the public, with the ſame ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Three of the inquiries were publiſhed ſeveral years ago; two <note n="*" place="bottom">The inquiry into the influence of phyſical cauſes on the moral faculty, and the inquiry into the influence of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous liquors upon the human body, &amp;c.</note> of them in pam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phlets, and the third<note n="†" place="bottom">The inquiry into the cauſes of the increaſe of bilious and intermitting fevers in Pennſylvania.</note> in the ſecond volume of the American Philoſophical Tranſactions. They are now republiſhed, in their preſent form, at the requeſt of ſeveral of my friends, with the addition, chiefly, of a few notes.</p>
            <p>I AM aware of the fate of every attempt to introduce new opinions into medicine. My apology for this attempt in ſome of the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing eſſays is, that I believe the want of ſucceſs in the treatment of thoſe diſeaſes
<pb n="ii" facs="unknown:026112_0004_0FCFF44F1556E7E8"/>
which are thought to be incurable, is occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, in moſt caſes, by an attachment to ſuch theories as are imperfect or erroneous. I do not ſay, by a want of theory altogether, for it is impoſſible for a phyſician to preſcribe, without a theory of ſome kind. I believe further, after all that has been ſaid againſt theory, and in favour of ſimple obſervation in medicine, that uniform and complete ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs can never be attained, but by combining with obſervation a perfect knowledge of all the cauſes of diſeaſes. Perhaps it would be equally juſt to aſſert, that obſervation will always be extenſive, accurate, and uſeful, in proportion as it is directed by principles in medicine.</p>
            <p>I HAVE one more excuſe to offer for my temerity in propoſing the new opinions which are contained in the following inquiries, and that is, they were not ſought for, but obtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon me, and that too in ſpite of a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of the certain loſs of reputation which follows a change of opinion upon any ſubject; for I well knew the world was not diſpoſed to admit as a juſtification of this change, that
<pb n="iii" facs="unknown:026112_0005_0FCFF4509AE77768"/>
it is always the neceſſary effect of the diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very or adoption of new truths; and that ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility in principles and practice, in an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſcience, is, for the moſt part, the effect of a timid or ſlothful perſeverance in ignorance or error.</p>
            <p>IN departing in ſome things from the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem of Dr. Cullen, in which I was educated, I do not relinquiſh the whole of his princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, much leſs do I reject indiſcriminately the ſyſtems of authors, whether ancient or modern, of leſs reputation. Truth in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine, as far as it has been diſcovered, like truth in religion, appears to exiſt in greater or leſs proportions in different ſyſtems; but the fabric which ſhall include a knowledge of the cauſes and cure of every diſeaſe, remains yet to be completed, by an application to its unfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed parts, of the ſucceſſive labors of Phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians in generations, or perhaps ages, yet to come.</p>
            <p>HAD I yielded to perſonal conſiderations, I ſhould have kept theſe papers a few years longer from the public eye, in order that they
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:026112_0006_0FCF4963162E15D8"/>
might have become more correct from the influence which time alone exerts upon all literary performances; but I have preferred at every hazard, fending them thus early into the world, from a deſire that my opinions and practice may be corrected, or ſupported, by the auxiliary obſervations and reaſonings of my medical brethren; and that ſeveral formidable diſeaſes may thereby be oppoſed, not by an individual only, but by the confe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derated exertions of men of different talents, and ſituations, in every part of the republic of medicine.</p>
            <p>I HAD another reaſon for committing theſe Eſſays to the preſs, in their preſent immature ſtate, and that was, I have obſerved freedom in thinking, to be neceſſarily connected with freedom in communicating the reſult of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiries after truth. I conſider this volume therefore, with all its imperfections, as a pledge of equal boldneſs, and I hope, of more ſucceſs, in all future inveſtigations.</p>

            <head>AN INQUIRY INTO THE INFLUENCE OF PHYSICAL CAUSES UPON THE MORAL FACULTY, DELIVERED BEFORE THE AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL SOCIETY, Held in Philadelphia, on the 27th of February, 1786.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>GENTLEMEN,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>IT was for the landable purpoſe of exciting a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of emulation and enquiry, among the mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of our body, that the founders of our ſociety, inſtituted an annual oration. The taſk of prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, and delivering this exerciſe, hath devolved, once more, upon me. I have ſubmitted to it, not becauſe I thought myſelf capable of fulfilling your intentions, but becauſe I wiſhed, by a teſtimony of my obedience to your requeſts, to atone for my long abſence from the temple of ſcience.</p>
            <p>THE ſubject upon which I am to have the honor of addreſſing you this evening, is <q>An enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:026112_0008_0FCFF45456F5BF20"/>
the influence of phyſical cauſes upon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral faculty.</q>
            </p>
            <p>BY the moral faculty I mean a power in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind of diſtinguiſhing and chuſing good and evil, or in other words, virtue and vice. It is a native principle, and though it be capable of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement by experience and reflection, it is not derived from either of them.—St. Paul, and Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cero, give us the moſt perfect account of it that is to be found in modern or ancient authors. <q>For when the Gentiles, (ſays St. Paul) which have not the law, do by nature the things contained in the law, <hi>theſe,</hi> having not the law, are a <hi>law</hi> unto themſelves; which ſhew the works of the law written in their hearts, their conſciences alſo bearing witneſs, and their thoughts the mean while accuſing, or elſe excuſing another.</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Rom i. 14.15.</note>
            </p>
            <p>THE words of Cicero are as follow—<q>Eſt igi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tur haec, judices, non ſcripta, ſed nata lex, quam non didicimus, accepimus, legimus, verum ex na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tura ipſa arripuimus, hauſimus, expreſſimus, ad quam non docti, ſed facti, non inſtituti, ſed imbuti ſumus.</q>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Oratio pro Milone.</note> This faculty is often confounded with ſcience, which is a diſtinct and independent power of the mind. This is evident from the paſſage
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:026112_0009_0FCFF456871BE688"/>
quoted from the writings of St. Paul, in which conſcience is ſaid to be the witneſs that accuſes or excuſes us, of a breach of the law written in our hearts. The moral faculty is what the ſchoolmen call the "regula regulans,"—the conſcience is their "regula regulata." Or, to ſpeak in more modern terms, the moral faculty performs the office of a law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giver, while the buſineſs of conſcience is to perform the duty of a judge. The moral faculty is to the conſcience, what taſte is to the judgment, and ſenſation to perception. It is quick in its opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and like the ſenſative plant, acts without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection, while conſcience follows with deliberate ſteps, and meaſures all her actions, by the unerring ſquare of right and wrong. The moral faculty exerciſes itſelf upon the actions of others. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves even in books, of the virtues of a Trajan, and diſapproves of the vices of a Marius, while conſcience confines its operations, only to its own actions. Theſe two powers of the mind are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally in an exact ratio to each other, but they ſometimes exiſt in different degrees in the ſame per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon. Hence we often find conſcience in its full vigor, with a diminiſhed tone, or total abſence of the moral faculty.</p>
            <p>IT has long been a queſtion among metaphyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, whether the conſcience be ſeated in the will or in the underſtanding. The controverſy can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:026112_0010_0FCFF4574CC0BD70"/>
be ſettled by admitting the will to be the ſeat of the moral faculty, and the underſtanding to be the ſeat of the conſcience. The myſterious nature of the union of thoſe two moral principles with the will and underſtanding, is a ſubject foreign to the buſineſs of the preſent enquiry.—</p>
            <p>AS I conſider virtue and vice to conſiſt in <hi>action,</hi> and not in opinion, and as this action has its ſeat in the <hi>will,</hi> and not in the conſcience, I ſhall confine my enquiries chiefly to the influence of phyſical cauſes upon that moral power of the mind, which is connected with volition, although many of theſe cauſes act likewiſe upon the conſcience, as I ſhall ſhew hereafter.—The ſtate of the moral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty is viſible in actions, which affect the well-be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſociety.

            <p>THE moral faculty has received different names from different authors. It is the "moral ſenſe" of Dr. Hutchiſon—the "ſympathy" of Dr. Adam Smith—the "moral inſtinct" of Rouſſeau—and "the light that lighteth every man that cometh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the world" of St John. I have adopted the term of moral faculty from Dr. Beattie, becauſe I conceive it conveys with the moſt perſpicuity, the
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:026112_0011_0FCFF45C8B47EC98"/>
idea of a power in the mind, of chuſing good and evil.</p>
            <p>OUR books of medicine contain many records of the effects of phyſical cauſes upon the memory— the imagination—and the judgment. In ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances we behold their operation only on one,— in others on two,—and in many caſes upon the whole of theſe faculties. Their derangement has received different names, according to the number or nature of the faculties that are affected. The loſs of memory has been called "amneſia"—falſe judgement upon one ſubject has been called "me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholia"—falſe judgement upon all ſubjects has been called "mania"—and a defect of all the three intellectual faculties that have been mentioned, has received the name of "amentia." Perſons who labour under the derangement, or want of theſe powers of the mind, are conſidered, very properly, as ſubjects of medicine; and there are many caſes upon record that prove, that their diſeaſes have yielded to the healing art.</p>
            <p>IN order to illuſtrate the effects of phyſical cauſes upon the moral faculty, it will be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary <hi>firſt</hi> to ſhew their effects upon the memory— the imagination and the judgment; and at the ſame time to point out the analogy between their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:026112_0012_0FCFF45D9C520BB8"/>
upon the intellectual powers of the mind, and the moral faculty.</p>
            <p n="1">1. DO we obſerve a connection between the intellectual powers, and the degrees of conſiſtency and firmneſs of the brain in infancy and child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood?—The ſame connection has been obſerved between the ſtrength as well as the progreſs of the moral faculty in children.</p>
            <p n="2">2. DO we obſerve a certain ſize of the brain, and a peculiar caſt of features, ſuch as the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent eye, and the aquiline noſe, to be connected with extraordinary portions of genius?—We ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a ſimilar connection between the figure and temperament of the body, and certain moral facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.—Hence, we often aſcribe good temper and benevolence to corpulency, and iraſcibility to ſanguineous habits. Caeſar thought himſelf ſafe in the friendſhip of the "ſleek-headed" Anthony and Dolabella; but was afraid to truſt to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of the ſlender Caſſius.</p>
            <p n="3">3. DO we obſerve certain degrees of the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tectual faculties to be hereditary in certain fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies? The ſame obſervation has been frequently extended to moral qualities—Hence we often find certain virtues and vices as peculiar to families, through all their degrees of conſanguinity, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:026112_0013_0FCFF45EE9B00710"/>
duration, as a peculiarity of voice—complexion— or ſhape.</p>
            <p n="4">4. DO we obſerve inſtances of a total want of memory—imagination—and judgment, either from an original defect in the ſtamina of the brain, or from the influence of phyſical cauſes?—The ſame unnatural defect is ſometimes obſerved, and probably from the ſame cauſes, of a moral faculty. The celebrated Servin whoſe character is drawn by the Duke of Sully in his Memoirs, appears to be an inſtance of the total abſence of the moral faculty, while the chaſm, produced by this defect, ſeems to have been filled up by a more than com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon extenſion of every other power of his mind. I beg leave to repeat the hiſtory of this prodigy of vice and knowledge.—<q>Let the reader re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſent to himſelf a man of a genius ſo lively, and of an underſtanding ſo extenſive, as rendered him ſcarce ignorant of any thing that could be known —of ſo vaſt and ready a comprehenſion, that he immediately made himſelf maſter of whatever he attempted—and of ſo prodigious a memory, that he never forgot what he once learned. He poſſeſſed all parts of philoſophy, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thematics, particularly fortification and drawing. Even in theology he was ſo well ſkilled, that he was an excellent preacher, whenever he had
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:026112_0014_0FCFF4640AC71820"/>
a mind to exert that talent, and an able diſput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, for and againſt the reformed religion indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently. He not only underſtood Greek—He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew— and all the languages which we call learned, but alſo all the different jargons, or modern dialects. He accented and pronounced them ſo naturally, and ſo perfectly imitated the geſtures and manners both of the ſeveral nations of Europe, and the particular provinces of France, that he might have been taken for a native of all, or any of theſe countries: and this quality he applied to counterfeit all ſorts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, wherein he ſucceeded wonderfully. He was moreover the beſt comedian, and the greateſt droll that perhaps ever appeared. He had a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius for poetry, and had wrote many verſes. He played upon almoſt all inſtruments—was a perfect maſter of muſic—and ſung moſt agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and juſtly. He likewiſe could ſay maſs, for he was of a diſpoſition to do, as well as to know, all things. His body was perfectly well ſuited to his mind. He was light, nimble, and dexterous, and fit for all exerciſes. He could ride well, and in dancing, wreſtling, and leap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he was admired. There are not any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creative games that he did not know, and he was ſkilled in almoſt all mechanic arts.—But now for the reverſe of the medal. Here it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:026112_0015_0FCFF46594202538"/>
that he was treacherous—cruel—cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardly—deceitful—a liar—a cheat—a drunkard and a glutton—a ſharper in play—immerſed in every ſpecies of vice—a blaſphemer—an atheiſt. —In a word, in him might be found all the the vices that are contrary to nature—honour— religion—and ſociety,—the truth of which he himſelf evinced with his lateſt breath; for he died in the flower of his age, in a common bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thel, perfectly corrupted by his debaucheries, and expired with the glaſs in his hand, curſing, and denying God<note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. III. p. 216.217.</note>.</q>

            <p>IT was probably a ſtate of the human mind ſuch as have been deſcribed, that our Saviour alluded to in the diſciple, who was about to betray him, when he called him "a devil." Perhaps the eſſence of depravity in infernal ſpirits, conſiſts in their being wholly devoid of a moral faculty.

by aſking, whether they were to be tormented be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their time: But this is the effect of conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and hence ariſes another argument in favour of this judicial power of the mind, being diſtinct from the moral faculty. It would ſeem as if the Supreme Being had preſerved the moral faculty in man from the ruins of his fall, on purpoſe to guide him back again to Paradiſe, and at the ſame time had conſtituted the conſcience, both in men and in fallen ſpirits, a kind of royalty in his moral empire, on purpoſe to ſhew his property in all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligent creatures, and their original reſemblance to himſelf. Perhaps the eſſence of moral depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity in man conſiſts in a total, but temporary ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of the power of conſcience. Perſons in this ſituation are emphatically ſaid in the ſcriptures to be "paſt feeling"—and to have their conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences feared, with a "hot iron"—they are likewiſe ſaid to be "twice dead"—that is, the ſame torpor or moral inſenſibility, has ſeized both the moral faculty and the conſcience.</p>
            <p n="5">5. DO we ever obſerve inſtances of the exiſtence of only <hi>one</hi> of the three intellectual powers of the mind that have been named, in the abſence of the other two? We obſerve ſomething of the ſame kind with reſpect to the moral faculty. I once knew a man, who diſcovered no one mark of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:026112_0017_0FCFF467DD999748"/>
who poſſeſſed the moral ſenſe or faculty in ſo high a degree, that he ſpent his whole life in acts of benevolence. He was not only inoffenſive, (which is not always the caſe with idiots) but he was kind and affectionate to every body. He had no ideas of time, but what were ſuggeſted to him by the returns of the ſtated periods for public wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, in which he appeared to take great delight. He ſpent ſeveral hours of every day in devotion, in which he was ſo careful to be private, that he was once found in the moſt improbable place in the world for that purpoſe, viz. in an oven.</p>
            <p n="6">6. DO we obſerve the memory, the imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the judgment, to be affected by diſeaſes, particularly by fevers and madneſs? Where is the phyſician, who has not ſeen the moral faculty af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected from the ſame cauſes! How often do we ſee the temper wholly changed by a fit of ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs! And now often do we hear perſons of the moſt delicate virtue, utter ſpeeches in the delirium of a fever, that are offenſive to decency, or good manners! I have heard a well atteſted hiſtory of a clergyman of the moſt exemplary moral charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who ſpent the laſt moments of a fever which deprived him both of his reaſon and his life, in profane curſing and ſwearing. I once attended a young woman in a nervous fever, who diſcovered
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:026112_0018_0FCFF46C6316A698"/>
after her recovery, a loſs of her former habit of veracity. Her memory (a defect of which, might be ſuſpected of being the cauſe of this vice) was in every reſpect as perfect as it was before the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack of the fever<note n="*" place="bottom">I have ſelected this caſe from many others, which have come under my notice, in which the moral faculty appeared to be impaired by diſeaſes, particularly by the typhus of Dr Cullen, and by thoſe ſpecies of palſy which affect the brain.</note>. The inſtances of immorality in maniacs, who were formerly diſtinguiſhed for the oppoſite character, are ſo numerous, and well known, that it will not be neceſſary to ſelect any caſes, to eſtabliſh the truth of the propoſition con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained under this head.</p>
            <p n="7">7. DO we obſerve any of the three intellectual powers that have been named, enlarged by diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes? Patients in the delirium of a fever, often diſcover extraordinary flights of imagination, and madmen often aſtoniſh us with their wonderful acts of memory. The ſame enlargement, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, appears in the operations of the moral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty. I have more than once heard the moſt ſublime diſcourſes on morality in the cell of an hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, and who has not ſeen inſtances of patients in acute diſeaſes, diſcovering degrees of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence

            <p n="8">8. DO we ever obſerve a partial inſanity, or falſe perception on one ſubject, while the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is ſound and correct, upon all others? We perceive, in ſome inſtances, a ſimilar defect in the moral faculty. There are perſons who are moral in the higheſt degree, as to certain duties, who nevertheleſs live under the influence of ſome one vice. I knew an inſtance of a woman, who was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplary in her obedience to every command of the moral law, except one. She could not refrain from ſtealing. What made this vice the more remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able was, that ſhe was in eaſy circumſtances, and not addicted to extravagance in any thing. Such was her propenſity to this vice, that when ſhe could lay her hands upon nothing more valuable, ſhe would often, at the table of a friend, fill her pockets ſecretly with bread. As a proof that her judgment was not affected by this defect in her moral faculty, ſhe would both confeſs and lament her crime, when detected in it.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:026112_0020_0FCFF476C4833278"/>9. DO we obſerve the imagination in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances to be affected with apprehenſions of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers that have no exiſtence? In like manner we obſerve the moral faculty to diſcover a ſenſibility to vice, that is by no means proportioned to its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of depravity. How often do we ſee perſons labouring under this morbid ſenſibility of the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral faculty, refuſe to give a direct anſwer to a plain queſtion, that related perhaps only to the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or to the hour of the day, leſt they ſhould wound the peace of their minds by telling a falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood!</p>
            <p n="10">10. DO dreams affect the memory—the imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation—and the judgment? Dreams are nothing but incoherent ideas, occaſioned by partial or im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſleep. There is a variety in the ſuſpenſion of the powers of the mind in this ſtate of the ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem. In ſome caſes the imagination only is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranged in dreams—in others the memory is affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—and in others the judgment.—But there are caſes, in which the change that is produced in the ſtate of the brain, by means of ſleep, affects the moral faculty likewiſe; hence we ſometimes dream of doing and ſaying things when aſleep, which we ſhudder at, as ſoon as we awake. This ſuppoſed defection from virtue, exiſts frequently in dreams where the memory and judgment are
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026112_0021_0FCFF477C7844D18"/>
ſcarcely impaired. It cannot therefore be aſcribed to the deſertion of thoſe two powers of the mind.</p>
            <p n="11">11. DO we read, in the accounts of travellers, of men, who in reſpect of intellectual capacity and enjoyments, are but a few degrees above brutes? We read likewiſe of a ſimilar degradation of our ſpecies, in reſpect to moral capacity and feeling. Here it will be neceſſary to remark, that the low degrees of moral perception, that have been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in certain African and Ruſſian tribes of men, no more invalidate our propoſition of the univerſal and eſſential exiſtence of a moral faculty in the human mind, than the low ſtate of their intellects prove, that reaſon is not natural to man. Their perceptions of good and evil are in an exact pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to their intellectual powers. But I will go further, and admit with Mr. Locke<note n="*" place="bottom">Eſſay concerning the Human Underſtanding, Book I. Chap. III.</note>, that ſome ſavage nations are totally devoid of the moral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, yet it will by no means follow, that this was the original conſtitution of their minds. The appetite for certain aliments is uniform among all mankind. Where is the nation and the individual, in their primitive ſtate of health, to whom bread is not agreeable? But if we ſhould find ſavages, or
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:026112_0022_0FCFF479D10DEFB0"/>
individuals, whoſe ſtomachs have been ſo diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by intemperance, as to refuſe this ſimple and wholeſome article of diet, ſhall we aſſert, that this was the original conſtitution of their appetites?— By no means. As well might we aſſert, becauſe ſavages deſtroy their beauty by painting and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting their faces, that the principles of taſte do not exiſt naturally in the human mind. It is with vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue as with fire. It exiſts in the mind, as fire does in certain bodies in a latent or quieſcent ſtate. As colliſion renders the one ſenſible, ſo education renders the other viſible. It would be as abſurd to maintain, becauſe olives become agreeable to many people from habit, that we have no natural appetites for any other kind of food, as to aſſert that any part of the human ſpecies exiſt without a moral principle, becauſe in ſome of them, it has wanted cauſes to excite it into action, or has been perverted by example. There are appetites that are wholly artificial. There are taſtes ſo entirely vitiated, as to perceive beauty in deformity. There are torpid and unnatural paſſions. Why, under certain unfavourable circumſtances, may there not exiſt alſo a moral faculty, in a ſtate of ſleep, or ſubject to miſtakes?</p>
            <p>THE only apology I ſhall make, for preſuming to differ from that juſtly-celebrated oracle, who firſt
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026112_0023_0FCFF47C0FB554F0"/>
unfolded to us a map of the intellectual world, ſhall be, that the eagle eye of genius often darts its views beyond the notice of facts, which are accommodated to the ſlender organs of percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of men, who poſſeſs no other talent than that of obſervation.</p>
            <p>IT is not ſurpriſing, that Mr. Locke has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded this moral principle with <hi>reaſon,</hi> or that Lord Shaftſbury has confounded it with <hi>taſte,</hi> ſince all three of theſe faculties agree in the objects of their approbation, notwithſtanding they exiſt in the mind independent of each other. The fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable influence which the progreſs of ſcience and taſte has had upon the morals, can be aſcribed to nothing elſe, but to the perfect union that ſubſiſts in nature between the dictates of reaſon—of taſte—and of the moral faculty. Why has the ſpirit of humanity made ſuch rapid progreſs for ſome years paſt in the courts of Europe? It is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe kings and their miniſters have been taught to <hi>reaſon</hi> upon philoſophical ſubjects.—Why have indecency and profanity been baniſhed from the ſtage in London and Paris? It is becauſe immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality is an offence againſt the highly cultivated <hi>taſte</hi> of the French and Engliſh nations.</p>
            <p>It muſt afford great pleaſure to the lovers of virtue, to behold the depth and extent of this
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:026112_0024_0FCFF47F5ED9C808"/>
moral principle in the human mind. Happily for the human race, the intimations of duty and the road to happineſs are not left to the ſlow opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or doubtful inductions of reaſon, nor to the precarious deciſions of taſte! Hence we often find the moral faculty in a ſtate of vigor, in perſons in whom reaſon and taſte exiſt in a weak, or in an uncultivated ſtate. It is worthy of notice like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, that while <hi>ſecond</hi> thoughts are beſt in mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of judgment, <hi>firſt</hi> thoughts are always to be preferred in matters that relate to morality. <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond</hi> thoughts, in theſe caſes, are generally parlies between duty and corrupted inclinations. Hence Rouſſeau has juſtly ſaid, that "a well regulated moral inſtinct is the ſureſt guide to happineſs."</p>
            <p>IT muſt afford equal pleaſure to the lovers of virtue to behold, that our moral conduct and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs are not committed to the determination of a ſingle legiſlative power.—The conſcience, like a wiſe and faithful legiſlative council, performs the office of a check upon the moral faculty, and thus prevents the fatal conſequences of immoral actions.</p>
            <p>AN objection, I foreſee, will ariſe to the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the influence of phyſical cauſes upon the moral faculty, from its being ſuppoſed to favor the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:026112_0025_0FCFF48443112030"/>
opinion of the <hi>materiality</hi> of the ſoul. But I do not ſee that this doctrine obliges us to decide upon the queſtion of the nature of the ſoul, any more than the facts which prove the influence of phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal cauſes upon the memory—the imagination— or the judgment. I ſhall, however remark upon this ſubject, that the writers in favor of the <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality</hi> of the ſoul have done that truth great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury, by connecting it neceſſarily with its <hi>immateri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality.</hi> The immortality of the ſoul depends upon the <hi>will</hi> of the Deity, and not upon the ſuppoſed properties of ſpirit. Matter is in its own nature as immortal as ſpirit. It is reſolveable by heat and mixture into a variety of forms; but it requires the ſame Almighty hand to annihilate it, that it did to create it. I know of no arguments to prove the immortality of the ſoul, but ſuch as are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived from the Chriſtian revelation<note n="*" place="bottom">"Life and immortality <hi>are</hi> brought to light <hi>only</hi> through the goſpel."—2 Tim. i. 10.</note>. It would be as reaſonable to aſſert, that the baſon of the ocean is immortal, from the greatneſs of its capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city to hold water; or that we are to live for ever in this world, becauſe we are afraid of dying, as to maintain the immortality of the ſoul, from the greatneſs of its capacity for knowledge and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs, or from its dread of annihilation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:026112_0026_0FCFF4856CA37D80"/>I remarked in the beginning of this diſcourſe, that perſons who were deprived of the juſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of memory—imagination—or judgment, were proper ſubjects of medicine; and that there are many caſes upon record which prove, that the diſeaſes from the derangement of theſe faculties, have yielded to the healing art.</p>
            <p>IT is perhaps only becauſe the diſorders of the moral faculty, have not been traced to a connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with phyſical cauſes, that medical writers have neglected to give them a place in their ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tems of noſology, and that ſo few attempts have been hitherto made, to leſſen or remove them by phyſical as well as rational and moral remedies.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not attempt to derive any ſupport to my opinions, from the analogy of the influence of phyſical cauſes upon the temper and conduct of brute animals. The facts which I ſhall produce in favor of the action of theſe cauſes upon morals in the human ſpecies, will, I hope, render unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary the arguments that might be drawn from that quarter.</p>
            <p>I am aware, that in venturing upon this ſubject, I ſtep upon untrodden ground.——I feel as Aeneas did, when he was about to enter the gates of A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernus, but without a Sibyl to inſtruct me in the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:026112_0027_0FCFF487537CA5C0"/>
myſteries that are before me. I foreſee, that men who have been educated in the mechanical habits of adopting popular or eſtabliſhed opinions, will revolt at the doctrine I am about to deliver— while men of ſenſe and genius will hear my propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions with candor, and if they do not adopt them, will commend that boldneſs of enquiry, that prompted me to broach them.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin with an attempt to ſupply the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of noſological writers, by naming the partial or weakened action of the moral faculty, MI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>CRONOMIA. The total abſence of this faculty, I ſhall call ANOMIA. By the law, referred to in theſe new genera of veſaniae, I mean the law of nature written in the human heart, and which I formerly quoted from the writings of St. Paul.</p>
            <p>IN treating of the effects of phyſical cauſes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moral faculty, it might help to extend our ideas upon this ſubject, to reduce virtues and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to certain ſpecies, and to point out the effects of particular ſpecies of virtue and vice; but this would lead us into a field too extenſive for the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits of the preſent enquiry. I ſhall only hint at a few caſes, and have no doubt but the ingenuity of my auditors will ſupply my ſilence, by applying the reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:026112_0028_0FCFF488DA2B9D90"/>IT is immaterial, whether the phyſical cauſes that are to be enumerated, act upon the moral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty through the medium of the ſenſes—the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions—the memory—or the imagination. Their influence is equally certain, whether they act as remote, pre-diſpoſing, or occaſional cauſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE effects of CLIMATE upon the moral faculty claim our firſt attention. Not only indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals, but nations, derive a conſiderable part of their moral, as well as intellectual character, from the different portions they enjoy of the rays of the ſun. Iraſcibility—levity—timidity—and indolence, tempered with occaſional emotions of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, are the moral qualities of the inhabitants of warm climates, while ſelfiſhneſs tempered with ſincerity and integrity, form the moral cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the inhabitants of cold countries.— The ſtate of the weather, and the ſeaſons of the year alſo, have a viſible effect upon moral ſenſibility. The month of November, in Great Britain, rendered gloomy by conſtant fogs and rains, has been thought to favor the perpetration of the worſt ſpecies of murder, while the vernal ſun, in middle latitudes, has been as gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:026112_0029_0FCF496AD707B0E0"/>
remarked for producing gentleneſs and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE effects of DIET upon the moral faculty are more certain, though leſs attended to, than the effects of climate. "Fullneſs of bread," we are told, was one of the prediſpoſing cauſes of the vices of the cities of the plain. The faſts ſo often inculcated among the Jews, were intended to leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen the incentives to vice; for pride—cruelty— and ſenſuality, are as much the natural conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of luxury, as apoplexies and palſies. But the <hi>quality</hi> as well as the quantity of aliment, has an influence upon morals; hence we find the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral diſeaſes that have been mentioned, are moſt frequently the offspring of animal food. The prophet Iſaiah ſeems to have been ſenſible of this, when he aſcribes ſuch ſalutary effects to a tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate and vegetable diet. "Butter and honey ſhall he eat," ſays he, <hi>"that</hi> he may know to refuſe the evil, and to chuſe the good."—But we have many facts which prove the efficacy of a vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diet upon the paſſions. Dr. Arbuthnot aſſures us, that he cured ſeveral patients of iraſcible tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, by nothing but a preſcription of this ſimple and temperate regimen.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:026112_0030_0FCFF48DA448E8F0"/>3. THE effects of CERTIAN DRINKS upon the moral faculty are not leſs obſervable, than upon the intellectual powers of the mind. Fermented liquors of a good quality, and taken in a mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate quantity, are favorable to the virtues of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor, benevolence and generoſity; but when they are taken in exceſs, or when they are of a bad quality, and drank even in a moderate quantity, they ſeldom fail of rouſing every latent ſpark of vice into action. The laſt of theſe facts is ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious, that when a man is obſerved to be ill-natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or quarrelſome in Portugal, after drinking, it is common in that country to ſay, that "he has drank bad wine." While occaſional fits of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxication produce ill temper in many people, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual drunkenneſs (which is generally produced by diſtilled ſpirits) never fails to eradicate veraci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and integrity from the human mind. Perhaps this may be the reaſon why the Spaniards, in an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient times, never admitted a man's evidence in a court of juſtice, who had been convicted of drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs.—Water is the univerſal ſedative of tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bulent paſſions—it not only promotes a general equanimity of temper, but it compoſes anger. I have heard ſeveral well-atteſted caſes, of a draught of cold water having ſuddenly compoſed this vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent paſſion, after the uſual remedies of reaſon had been applied to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:026112_0031_0FCFF4928C6775F8"/>4. EXTREME HUNGER produces the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly effects upon moral ſenſibility. It is imma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial, whether it acts by inducing a relaxation of the ſolids, or an acrimony of the fluids, or by the combined operation of both thoſe phyſical cauſes. The Indians in this country whet their appetites for that ſavage ſpecies of war, which is peculiar to them, by the ſtimulus of hunger; hence, we are told, they always return meagre and emaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated from their military excurſions. In civilized life we often behold this ſenſation an overbalance for the reſtraints of moral feeling; and perhaps this may be the reaſon, why poverty, which is the moſt frequent parent of hunger, diſpoſes ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally to theft; for the character of hunger is taken from that vice—It belongs to it "to break through ſtone walls." So much does this ſenſation predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate over reaſon and moral feeling, that Cardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal de Retz ſuggeſts to politicians, never to riſk a motion in a popular aſſembly, however wiſe or juſt it may be, immediately before dinner.—That temper muſt be uncommonly guarded, which is not diſturbed by long abſtinence from food. One of the worthieſt men I ever knew, who made his breakfaſt his principal meal, was peeviſh and diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to his friends and family, from the time he left his bed, till he ſat down to his morning re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt, after which, chearfulneſs ſparkled in his
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:026112_0032_0FCFF49400C99D48"/>
countenance, and he became the delight of all around him.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I hinted formerly, in proving the analogy between the effects of DISEASES upon the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects, and upon the moral faculty, that the latter was frequently impaired by fevers and madneſs. I beg leave to add further upon this head, that not only fevers and madneſs, but the hyſteria and hypochondriaſis, as well as all thoſe ſtates of the body, whether idiopathic or ſymptomatic, which are accompanied with preternatural irritability— ſenſibility—torpor—ſtupor—or mobility of the nervous ſyſtem, diſpoſe to vice, either of the body or of the mind. It is in vain to attack theſe vices with lectures upon morality. They are only to be cured by medicine,—particularly by exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,—the cold bath,—and by a cold or warm at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere. The young woman, whoſe caſe I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned formerly, that loſt her habit of veracity by a nervous fever, recovered this virtue, as ſoon as her ſyſtem recovered its natural tone, from the cold weather which happily ſucceeded her fever<note n="*" place="bottom">There is a morbid ſtate of excitability in the body during the convaleſcence from fever, which is intimately connected with an undue propenſity to venereal pleaſures. I have met with ſeveral inſtances of it. The marriage of the cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated Mr. Howard to a woman who was twice as old as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and very ſickly, has been aſcribed by his biographer, Dr. Aiken, to <hi>gratitude</hi> for her great attention to him in a fit of ſickneſs, I am diſpoſed to aſcribe it to a ſudden pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm of another paſſion, which as a religious man, he could not gratify in any other, than in a lawful way. I have heard of two young clergymen who married the women who had nurſed them in fits of ſickneſs. In both caſes there was great inequality in their years, and condition in life. Their motive was, probably, the ſame as that which I have attributed to Mr. Howard. Dr. Patrick Ruſſel takes notice of an uncommon degree of venereal excitability which fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed attacks of the plague at Meſſina, in 1743, in all ranks of people.—Marriages, he ſays, were more frequent after it than uſual, and virgins were, in ſome inſtances violated, who died of that diſorder, by perſons who had juſt recovered from it.</note>.</p>

               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:026112_0033_0FCFF495C091F348"/>6. IDLENESS is the parent of every vice. It is mentioned in the Old Teſtament as another of the the prediſpoſing cauſes of the vices of the cities of the plain. LABOR of all kinds, favors and facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates the practice of virtue. The country life is a happy life; chiefly, becauſe its laborious employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are favourable to virtue, and unfriendly to vice. It is a common practice, I have been told, for the planters in the Southern States, to conſign a houſe ſlave, who has become vicious from idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, to the drudgery of the field, in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form him. The Bridewells and workhouſes of all civilized countries prove, that LABOR is not only
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:026112_0034_0FCFF497E53CC6A0"/>
a very ſevere, but the moſt benevolent of all pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhments, in as much as it is one of the moſt ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able means of reformation. Mr Howard tells us in his Hiſtory of Priſons, that in Holland it is a common ſaying, "Make men work and you will make them honeſt." And over the raſp and ſpin-houſe at Groeningen, this ſentiment is expreſſed (he tells us) by a happy motto:
<q>"Vitiorum ſemina—otium—labore exhauriendum."</q>
The effects of ſteady labor in early life, in creating virtuous habits, is ſtill more remarkable. The late Anthony Benezet of this city, whoſe benevolence was the ſentinel of the virtue, as well as of the happineſs of his country, made it a conſtant rule in binding out poor children, to avoid putting them into wealthy families, but always preferred ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters for them who worked themſelves, and who obliged theſe children to work in their preſence. If the habits of virtue, contracted by means of this apprenticeſhip to labor, are purely mechanical, their effects are, nevertheleſs, the ſame upon the happineſs of ſociety, as if they flowed from prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple. The mind, moreover, when preſerved by theſe means from weeds, becomes a more mellow ſoil afterwards, for moral and rational improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
            <p n="7">
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:026112_0035_0FCFF499FA1A38C8"/>7. THE effects of EXCESSIVE SLEEP are intimate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly connected with the effects of idleneſs upon the moral faculty,—hence we find that moderate, and even ſcanty portions of ſleep, in every part of the world, have been found to be friendly, not only to health and long life, but in many inſtances to morality. The practice of the Monks, who of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten ſleep upon a floor, and who generally riſe with the ſun, for the ſake of mortifying their ſenſual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites, is certainly founded in wiſdom, and has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten produced the moſt ſalutary moral effects.</p>
            <p n="8">8. THE effects of BODILY PAIN upon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, are not leſs remarkable than upon the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lectual powers of the mind. The late Dr Gregory, of the univerſity of Edinburgh, uſed to tell his pupils, that he always found his perceptions quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in a fit of the gout, than at any other time. The pangs which attend the diſſolution of the body, are often accompanied with conceptions and expreſſions upon the moſt ordinary ſubjects, that diſcover an uncommon elevation of the intellectual powers. The effects of bodily pain are exactly the ſame in rouſing and directing the moral facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Bodily pain, we find, was one of the reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies employed in the Old Teſtament, for extirpat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing vice and promoting virtue: and Mr Howard tells us, that he ſaw it employed ſucceſsfully as a
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:026112_0036_0FCFF49B317F3BF0"/>
means of reformation, in one of the priſons which he viſited. If pain has a phyſical tendency to cure vice, I ſubmit it to the conſideration of parents and legiſlators, whether moderate degrees of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhments, inflicted for a great length of time, would not be more medicinal in their effects, than the violent degrees of them, which are of ſhort duration.</p>
            <p n="9">9. TOO much cannot be ſaid in favour of CLEANLINESS, as a phyſical means of promoting virtue. The writings of Moſes have been called by military men, the beſt "orderly book" in the world. In every part of them we find cleanlineſs inculcated with as much zeal, as if it was part of the moral, inſtead of the levitical law. Now, it is well-known, that the principal deſign of every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept and rite of the ceremonial parts of the Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh religion, was to prevent vice, and to promote virtue. All writers upon the leproſy, take notice of its connection with a certain vice. To this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe groſs animal food, particularly ſwine's fleſh, and a dirty ſkin, have been thought to be prediſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing cauſes—hence the reaſon, probably, why pork was forbidden, and why ablutions of the body and limbs were ſo frequently inculcated by the Jewiſh law. Sir John Pringle's remarks, in his Oration upon Captain Cook's Voyage, deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:026112_0037_0FCFF49C50586320"/>
before the Royal Society in London, are very pertinent to this part of our ſubject.— <q>Cleanlineſs (ſays he) is conducive to health, but it is not ſo obvious, that it alſo tends to good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and other virtues. Such (meaning the ſhip's crew) as were made more cleanly, became more ſober, more orderly, and more attentive to duty.</q> The benefit to be derived by parents and ſchoolmaſters from attending to theſe facts, is too obvious to be mentioned.</p>
            <p n="10">10. I hope I ſhall be excuſed in placing SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LITUDE among the phyſical cauſes which influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the moral faculty, when I add, that I confine its effects to perſons who are irreclaimable by ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional or moral remedies. Mr Howard informs us, that the chaplain of the priſon at Liege in Germany aſſured him, <q>that the moſt refractory and turbulent ſpirits, became tractable and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive, by being cloſely confined for four or five days.</q>—In bodies that are prediſpoſed to vice, the ſtimulus of cheerful, but much more of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane ſociety and converſation, upon the animal ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, becomes an exciting cauſe, and like the ſtroke of the flint upon the ſteel, renders the ſparks of vice both active and viſible. By removing men out of the reach of this exciting cauſe, they are often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, eſpecially if they are confined long enough
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:026112_0038_0FCFF49E8DB9CF28"/>
to produce a ſufficient chaſm in their habits of vice. Where the benefit of reflection, and inſtruction from books, can be added to ſolitude and confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, their good effects are ſtill more certain. To this philoſophers and poets in every age have aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented, by deſcribing the life of a hermit as a life of paſſive virtue.</p>
            <p n="11">11. CONNECTED with ſolitude, as a mechanical means of promoting virtue, SILENCE deſerves to be mentioned in this place. The late Dr Fother<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gill, in his plan of education for that benevolent inſtitution at Ackworth, which was the laſt care of his uſeful life, ſays every thing that can be ſaid in favour of this neceſſary diſcipline, in the follow-words. <q>To habituate children from their early infancy, to ſilence and attention, is of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt advantage to them, not only as a preparative to their advancement in a religious life, but as the groundwork of a well cultivated under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. To have the active minds of children put under a kind of reſtraint—to be accuſtomed to turn their attention from external objects, and habituated to a degree of abſtracted quiet, is a matter of great conſequence, and laſting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit to them. Although it cannot be ſuppoſed, that young and active minds are always engaged in ſilence as they ought to be, yet to be accuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomed
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:026112_0039_0FCF496CE8B4CAA8"/>
thus to quietneſs, is no ſmall point gained towards fixing a habit of patience, and recollec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which ſeldom forſakes thoſe who have been properly inſtructed in this entrance of the ſchool of wiſdom, during the reſidue of their days.</q>
            </p>
            <p>FOR the purpoſe of acquiring this branch of educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, children cannot aſſociate too early, nor too often with their parents, or with their ſuperiors in age, rank, and wiſdom.</p>
            <p n="12">12. THE effects of muſic upon the moral faculty, have been felt and recorded in every country. Hence we are able to diſcover the virtues and vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of different nations, by their tunes, as certainly as by their laws. The effects of muſic, when ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply mechanical, upon the paſſions, are powerful and extenſive. But it remains yet to determine the degrees of moral ecſtaſy, that may be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by an attack upon the ear, the reaſon, and the moral principle, at the ſame time, by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined powers of muſic and eloquence.</p>
            <p n="13">13. THE eloquence of the pulpit is nearly allied to muſic in its effects upon the moral faculty. It is true, there can be no permanent change in the temper, and moral conduct of a man, that is not derived from the underſtanding and the will; but
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:026112_0040_0FCFF49F5DFA9B38"/>
we muſt remember, that theſe two powers of the mind are moſt aſſailable, when they are attacked through the avenue of the paſſions; and theſe, we know, when agitated by the powers of eloquence, exert a mechanical action upon every power of the ſoul. Hence we find in every age and country, where chriſtianity has been propagated, the moſt accompliſhed orators have generally been the moſt ſucceſsful reformers of mankind. There muſt be a defect of eloquence in a preacher, who with the reſources for oratory, which are contained in the Old and New Teſtaments, does not produce in every man who hears him, at leaſt a temporary love of virtue. I grant that the eloquence of the pulpit alone, cannot change men into chriſtians, but it certainly poſſeſſes the power of changing brutes into men. Could the eloquence of the ſtage be properly directed, it is impoſſible to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the extent of its mechanical effects upon mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals. The language and imagery of a Shakeſpeare, upon moral and religious ſubjects, poured upon the paſſions and the ſenſes, in all the beauty and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of dramatic repreſentation! Who could reſiſt, or deſcribe their effects?</p>
            <p n="14">14. ODORS of various kinds have been obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to act in the moſt ſenſible manner upon the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral faculty. Brydone tells us, upon the authority of a celebrated philoſopher in Italy, that the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:026112_0041_0FCFF4A0D217D218"/>
wickedneſs of the people who live in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood of Aetna and Veſuvius, is occaſioned chiefly by the ſmell of the ſulphur and of the hot exhalations which are conſtantly diſcharged from thoſe volcanos. Agreeable odors, ſeldom fail to inſpire ſerenity, and to compoſe the angry ſpirits— Hence the pleaſure, and one of the advantages of a flower garden. The ſmoke of tobacco is likewiſe of a compoſing nature, and tends not only to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce what is called a train in perception, but to huſh the agitated paſſions into ſilence and order— Hence the propriety of connecting the pipe or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar and the bottle together, in public company.</p>
            <p n="15">15. IT will be ſufficient only to mention light and darkneſs, to ſuggeſt facts in favor of the influence of each of them upon moral ſenſibility. How of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten do the peeviſh complaints of the night in ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, give way to the compoſing rays of the light of the morning? Othello cannot murder Deſde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mona by candle-light, and who has not felt the effects of a blazing fire, upon the gentle paſſions?</p>
            <p n="16">16. IT is to be lamented, that no experiments have as yet been made, to determine the effects of all the different ſpecies of Airs, which chemiſtry has lately diſcovered, upon the moral faculty. I have authority, from actual experiments, only to declare, that Dephlogiſticated Air, when taken in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:026112_0042_0FCFF4A24F04C5B8"/>
the lungs, produces cheerfulneſs, gentleneſs, and ſerenity of mind.</p>
            <p n="17">17. WHAT ſhall we ſay of the effects of Medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cines upon the moral faculty? That many ſubſtances in the materia medica act upon the intellects, is well known to phyſicians. Why ſhould it be thought impoſſible for medicines, to act in like manner up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moral faculty? May not the earth contain in its own bowels, or upon its ſurface, antidotes? But I will not blend facts with conjectures. Clouds and darkneſs ſtill hang upon this part of my ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject.</p>
            <p>LET it not be ſuſpected from any thing that I have delivered, that I ſuppoſe the influence of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſical cauſes upon the moral faculty, renders the agency of divine influence unneceſſary to our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral happineſs. I only maintain, that the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the divine government are carried on in the moral, as in the natural world, by the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality of ſecond cauſes. I have only trodden in the footſteps of the inſpired writers; for moſt of the phyſical cauſes I have enumerated, are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with moral precepts, or have been uſed as the means of reformation from vice, in the Old and New Teſtaments. To the caſes that have been mentioned I ſhall only add, that Nebuchad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nezzar was cured of his pride, by means of ſolitude
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:026112_0043_0FCFF4A46BEE79A8"/>
and a vegetable diet.—Saul was cured of his evil ſpirit, by means of David's harp, and St. Paul ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly ſays, <q>I keep my body under, and bring it into ſubjection, leſt that by any means, when I have preached to others, I myſelf ſhould be a caſt-away.</q> But I will go one ſtep further, and add in favor of divine influence upon the moral principle, that in thoſe extraordinary caſes, where bad men are ſuddenly reformed, without the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumentality of phyſical, moral, or rational cauſes, I believe that the organization of thoſe parts of the body, which form the link that binds it to the ſoul, undergoes a phyſical change;<note n="*" place="bottom">St. Paul was ſuddenly transformed from a perſecutor into a man of a gentle and amiable ſpirit. The manner in which this change was affected upon his mind, he tells us in the following words—<q>Neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but a new creature.— From henceforth let no man trouble me; for I bear in <hi>my body,</hi> the <hi>marks</hi> of our Lord Jeſus.</q> Galatians, vi. 15.17.</note> and hence the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of a "new creature," which is made uſe of in the ſcriptures to denote this change, is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in a literal, as well as a figurative ſenſe. It is probably the beginning of that perfect renovation of the human body, which is predicted by St Paul in the following words—<q>For our converſation is in heaven, from whence we look for the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:026112_0044_0FCF496E5447FC70"/>
who ſhall change our vile bodies, that they may be faſhioned according to his own glorious body.</q> I ſhall not pauſe to defend myſelf againſt the charge of enthuſiaſm in this place; for the age is at length arrived, ſo devoutly wiſhed for by Dr. Cheyne, in which men will not be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terred in their reſearches after truth, by the ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror of odious or unpopular names.</p>
            <p>I cannot help remarking under this head, that if the conditions of thoſe parts of the human body which are connected with the human ſoul, influence morals, the ſame reaſon may be given for a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous education, that has been admitted for teaching muſic and the pronunciation of foreign languages, in the early and yielding ſtate of thoſe organs, which form the voice and ſpeech. Such is the effect of a moral education, that we often ſee its fruits in advanced ſtages of life, after the religious principles which were connected with it, have been renounced; juſt as we perceive the ſame care in a ſurgeon in his attendance upon patients, after the ſympathy which firſt produced this care, has ceaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to operate upon his mind. The boaſted moral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of the Deiſts, is I believe, in moſt caſes, the off<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpring of habits, produced originally by the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and precepts of Chriſtianity. Hence appears the wiſdom of Solomon's advice—<q>Train up a

child in the way he ſhould go, and when he is old he will not,</q> I had almoſt ſaid, he cannot "depart from it."</p>
            <p>THUS have I enumerated the principal cauſes, which act mechanically upon morals. If from the combined action of phyſical powers that are oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to each other, the moral faculty ſhould become ſtationary, or if the virtue or vice produced by them, ſhould form a neutral quality, compoſed of both of them, I hope it will not call in queſtion the truth of our general propoſitions. I have only mentioned the effects of phyſical cauſes in a ſimple ſtate.<note n="*" place="bottom">The doctrine of the influence of phyſical cauſes on mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals is happily calculated to beget charity towards the fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of our fellow creatures. Our duty to practiſe this, (it is true) is enforced by motives drawn from ſciences, as well as from the precepts of chriſtianity.</note>
            </p>
            <p>IT might help to enlarge our ideas upon this ſubject, to take notice of the influence of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſtages of ſociety, of agriculture and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, of ſoil and ſituation, of the different degrees of cultivation of taſte, and of the intellectual pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, of the different forms of government, and laſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, of the different profeſſions and occupations of mankind, upon the moral faculty; but as theſe act

indirectly only, and by the intervention of cauſes that are unconnected with matter, I conceive they are foreign to the buſineſs of the preſent enquiry. If they ſhould vary the action of the ſimple phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal cauſes in any degree, I hope it will not call in queſtion the truth of our general propoſitions, any more than the compound action of phyſical powers, that are oppoſed to each other. There remain on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a few more cauſes which are of a compound nature, but ſo nearly related to thoſe, which are purely mechanical, that I ſhall beg leave to treſpaſs upon your patience, by giving them a place in my oration.</p>
            <p>THE effects of imitation, habit and aſſociation upon morals, would furniſh ample matter for inve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtigation. Conſidering how much the ſhape, tex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and conditions of the human body, influence morals, I ſubmit it to the conſideration of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious, whether in our endeavours to imitate moral examples, ſome advantage may not be deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, from our copying the features and external manners of the originals. What makes the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of this experiment probable is, that we gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally find men, whoſe faces reſemble each other, have the ſame manners and diſpoſitions. I infer the poſſibility of ſucceſs in an attempt to imitate originals in a manner that has been mentioned, from the facility with which domeſtics acquire a
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:026112_0047_0FCFF4B1C9B179D0"/>
reſemblance to their maſters and miſtreſſes, not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in manners, but in countenance, in thoſe caſes where they are tied to them, by reſpect, and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—Huſbands and wives alſo where they poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs the ſame ſpecies of face, under circumſtances of mutual attachment, often acquire a reſemblance to each other.</p>
            <p>FROM the general deteſtation in which hypocri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy is held both by good and bad men, the mechani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal effects of habit upon virtue, have not been ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently explored. There are, I am perſuaded, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances where virtues have been aſſumed by accident, or neceſſity, which have become real from habit, and afterwards derived their nouriſhment from the heart. Hence the propriety of Hamlet's advice to his mother—</p>

            <p>THE influence of ASSOCIATION upon morals, opens an ample field for enquiry. It is from this principle, that we explain the reformation from theft and drunkenneſs in ſervants which we ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſee produced by a draught of ſpirits in which tartar emetic had been ſecretly diſſolved. The recollection of the pain and ſickneſs excited by the emetic, naturally aſſociates itſelf with the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, ſo as to render them both equally the objects of averſion. It is by calling in this principle only, that we can account for the conduct of Moſes, in grinding the golden calf into a powder, and afterwards diſſolving it (probably by means of hepar ſulphuris) in water, and compelling the children of Iſrael to drink of it, as a puniſhment for their idolatry. This mixture is bitter and nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeating in the higheſt degree. An inclination to idolatry, therefore, could not be felt without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſociated with the remembrance of this diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable mixture, and of courſe being rejected, with equal abhorrence. The benefit of corporal puniſhments, when they are of a ſhort duration, depends in part up their being connected by time and place, with the crimes for which they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted. Quick as the thunder follows the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:026112_0049_0FCF4971E98B1220"/>
if it were poſſible, ſhould puniſhments fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the crimes, and the advantage of aſſociation would be more certain, if the ſpot where they were committed, were made the theatre of their expiation. It is from the effects of this aſſociation, probably, that the change of place and company produced by exile and tranſportation, has ſo often reclaimed bad men, after moral—rational—and phyſical means of reformation had been uſed to no purpoſe.</p>
            <p>AS SENSIBILITY is the avenue to the moral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, every thing which tends to diminiſh it tends alſo to injure morals.—The Romans owed much of their corruption to the ſights of the conteſts of their gladiators, and of criminals, with wild beaſts. For theſe reaſons, executions ſhould never be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic. Indeed, I believe there are no public puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of any kind, that do not harden the hearts of ſpectators, and thereby leſſen the natural horror which all crimes at firſt excite in the human mind.</p>
            <p>CRUELTY to brute animals is another means of deſtroying moral ſenſibility. The ferocity of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages has been aſcribed in part to their peculiar mode of ſubſiſtence. Mr. Hogarth points out in his ingenious prints, the connection between cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty to brute animals in youth, and murder in man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood.
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:026112_0050_0FCFF4B59FBA0648"/>
The Emperor Domitian prepared his mind by the amuſement of killing flies, for all thoſe bloody crimes which afterwards diſgraced his reign. I am ſo perfectly ſatisfied of the truth of a a connection between morals, and humanity to brutes, that I ſhall find it difficult to reſtrain my idolatry for that legiſlature, that ſhall firſt eſtabliſh a ſyſtem of laws, to defend them from outrage and oppreſſion.</p>
            <p>IN order to preſerve the vigor of the moral fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, it is of the utmoſt conſequence to keep young people as ignorant as poſſible of thoſe crimes, that are generally thought moſt diſgraceful to human na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. Suicide, I believe, is often propagated by means of news-papers. For this reaſon, I ſhould be glad to ſee the proceedings of our courts kept from the public eye, when they expoſe, or puniſh monſtrous vices.</p>
            <p>THE laſt mechanical method of promoting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality that I ſhall mention, is to keep ſenſibility alive, by a familiarity with ſcenes or diſtreſs from poverty and diſeaſe. Compaſſion never awakens in the human boſom, without being accompanied by a train of ſiſter virtues—hence the wiſe man juſtly remarks, that "By the ſadneſs of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, the heart is made better."</p>

Here the feeling heart—the tearful eye—and the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritable hand, may always be connected together, and the flame of ſympathy, inſtead of being extin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in taxes, or expiring in a ſolitary blaze by a ſingle contribution, may be kept alive, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant exerciſe. There is a neceſſary connection be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween animal ſympathy and good morals. The prieſt and the levite, in the New Teſtament, would probably have relieved the poor man who fell among thieves, had accident brought them near enough to his wounds.

            <p>LASTLY, ATTRACTION, COMPOSITION, and DECOMPOSITION, belong to the paſſions as well as to matter. Vices of the ſame ſpecies attract each other with the moſt force—hence the bad conſequences of crouding young men (whoſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſities are generally the ſame) under one roof, in our modern plans of education. The effects of compoſition and decompoſition upon vices, appear in the meanneſs of the ſchool-boy, being often cured by the prodigality of a military life, and by the precipitation, of avarice, which is often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by ambition and love.<note n="*" place="bottom">A citizen of Philadelphia had made many unſucceſsful attempts to cure his wiſe of drinking ardent ſpirits.

               <pb n="48" facs="unknown:026112_0054_0FCFF4C3E0FE0798"/>THE extent of the moral powers and habits in man is unknown. It is not improbable, but the human mind contains principles of virtue, which have never yet been excited into action. We be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold with ſurpriſe the verſatility of the human bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in the exploits of tumblers and rope-dancers. Even the agility of a wild beaſt has been demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated in a girl in France, and an amphibious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture has been diſcovered in the human ſpecies, in a young man in Spain. We liſten with aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the accounts of the <hi>memoirs</hi> of Mithri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates, Cyrus, and Servin.

From what has been ſaid, the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of this is obvious. Hitherto the cultivation of the moral faculty has been the buſineſs of pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, ſchoolmaſters and divines<note n="*" place="bottom">The people commonly called Quakers and the Metho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſts, make uſe of the greateſt number of phyſical remedies in their religious and moral diſcipline, of any ſects of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians—and hence we find them every where diſtinguiſhed for their good morals. There are ſeveral excellent <hi>phyſical</hi> inſtitutions in other churches; and if they do not produce the ſame moral effects, that we obſerve from phyſical inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions among thoſe two modern ſects, it muſt be aſcribed to their being more neglected by the members of thoſe churches.</note>. But if the

To encourage us to undertake experiments for the improvement of morals, let us recollect the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of philoſophy in leſſening the number, and mitigating the violence of incurable diſeaſes. The intermitting fever, which proved fatal to two of the monarchs of Britain, is now under abſolute ſubjection to medicine. Continual fevers are much leſs fatal than formerly.

Should the ſame induſtry and ingenuity, which have produced theſe triumphs of medicine over diſeaſes and death, be applied to the moral ſcience, it is highly probable, that moſt of thoſe baneful vices, which deform the the human breaſt, and convulſe the nations of the earth, might be baniſhed from the world. I am not ſo ſanguine as to ſuppoſe, that it is poſſible for man to acquire ſo much perfection from ſcience, religion, liberty and good govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as to ceaſe to be mortal; but I am fully perſuaded, that from the combined action of cauſes, which operate at once upon the reaſon, the moral faculty, the paſſions, the ſenſes, the brain, the nerves, the blood and the heart, it is poſſible to produce ſuch a change in his moral character, as ſhall raiſe him to a reſemblance of angels—nay more, to the likeneſs of GOD himſelf. —The State of Pennſylvania ſtill deplores the loſs of a man, in whom not only reaſon and reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,

literary ſocieties in Europe and America, to add the SCIENCE of MORALS to their experiments and enquiries. The godlike ſcheme of Henry the IV. of France, and of the illuſtrious Queen Elizabeth of England, for eſtabliſhing a perpetual peace in Europe, may be accompliſhed without a ſyſtem of juriſprudence, by a confederation of learned men, and learned ſocieties. It is in their power, by mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplying the objects of human reaſon, to bring the monarchs and rulers of the world, under their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, and thereby to extirpate war—ſlavery— and capital puniſhments, from the liſt of human evils. Let it not be ſuſpected that I detract by this declaration, from the honour of the chriſtian reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. It is true—Chriſtianity was propagated without the aid of human learning; but this was one of thoſe miracles, which was neceſſary to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh it, and which, by repetition, would ceaſe to be a miracle.

And perhaps one reaſon, why ſome parts of the Chriſtian revelation are ſtill involved in obſcurity, may be occaſioned by our imperfect knowledge of the phaenomena, and laws of nature. The truths of philoſophy and Chriſtianity, dwell alike in the mind of the Deity, and reaſon and religion are equally the offspring of his goodneſs. They muſt, therefore, ſtand and fall together. By reaſon, in the preſent inſtance, I mean the power of judging of truth, as well as the power of comprehending it.

            <p>BY Spirits I mean all thoſe liquors which are obtained by diſtillation from fermented jui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces or ſubſtances of any kind.

            <p>SINCE the introduction of ſpirituous liquors into ſuch general uſe, phyſicians have remarked that a number of new diſeaſes have appeared among
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:026112_0065_0FCFF4E09DA65CD0"/>
us, and have deſcribed many new ſymptoms as common to old diſeaſes. Spirits in their firſt ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration are ſtimulating upon the ſyſtem. They quicken the circulation of the blood, and produce ſome heat in the body. Soon afterwards, they become what is called ſedative; that is, they di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſh the action of the vital powers, and thereby produce languor and weakneſs.</p>
            <p>THE effects of ſpirituous liquors upon the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body, are ſometimes ſlow in their appearance. A ſtrong conſtitution, eſpecially if it be aſſiſted with conſtant and hard labour, will counteract the deſtructive effects of ſpirits for many years, but in general they produce the following diſeaſes:</p>
            <p>1. <hi>A ſickneſs at the ſtomach,</hi> and <hi>vomiting</hi> in the morning. This diſorder is generally accompanied by a want of appetite for breakfaſt. It is known by tremors in the hands, inſomuch that perſons who labour under it, are hardly able to lift a tea cup to their heads, till they have taken a doſe of ſome cordial liquor. In this diſorder, a peculiar paleneſs, with ſmall red ſtreaks, appear in the cheeks. The fleſh of the face, at the ſame time, has a peculiar fulneſs and flabbineſs, which are very different from ſound and health ſat.</p>

AN <hi>univerſal dropſy.</hi> This diſorder begins firſt in the lower limbs, and gradually extends itſelf throughout the whole body. I have been told that the merchants in Charleſton, South-Carolina, never truſt the planters when ſpirits have produced the firſt ſymptom of this diſorder upon them. It is very natural to ſuppoſe that induſtry and virtue have become extinct in that man, whoſe legs and feet are ſwelled, from the uſe of ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors.</p>
            <p>3. <hi>Obſtruction of the liver.</hi> This diſorder pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces other diſeaſes, ſuch as an inflammation, which ſometimes proves ſuddenly fatal—the jaun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice—and a dropſy in the belly.</p>

            <p>5. <hi>Pains in the limbs,</hi> accompanied by a ſenſe of burning in the palms of the hands and ſoles of the feet. This diſeaſe has ſometimes been called the Jamaica Rheumatiſm.</p>

               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:026112_0067_0FCFF4E514AC9A40"/>I do not aſſert that theſe diſorders are never produced by any other cauſes, but I maintain that ſpirituous liquors are the moſt frequent cauſes of them, and that when a prediſpoſition to them is produced by other cauſes, they are rendered more certain and more dangerous by the intemperate uſe of ſpirits.</p>
            <p>I have only named a few of the principal diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders which are produced by ſpirituous liquors. It would take up a volume to deſcribe how much other diſorders natural to the human body, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed and complicated by them. Every ſpecies of inflammatory and putrid fever, is rendered more frequent and more dangerous by the uſe of ſpirituous liquors.</p>
            <p>THE danger to life from the diſeaſes which have been mentioned is well known. I do not think it extravagant therefore to repeat here, what has been often ſaid, that ſpirituous liquors deſtroy more lives than the ſword. War has its intervals of deſtruction—but ſpirits operate at all times and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon human life. The ravages of war are
<pb n="63"
                   facs="unknown:026112_0068_0FCFF4E81C9C7298"

confined to but one part of the human ſpecies, <hi>viz.</hi> to men; but ſpirits act too often upon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who are exempted from the dangers of war by age or ſex; and laſtly, war deſtroys only thoſe perſons who allow the uſe of arms to be lawful, whereas ſpirits inſinuate their fatal effects among people, whoſe principles are oppoſed to the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of human blood.</p>
            <p>BUT the effects of ardent ſpirits upon the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man body, do not end in the deſtruction of life. They derange and even deform a <hi>dead</hi> body ſo as to render it a loathſome addition to the clay which conceals it from human view after death. This has been frequently demonſtrated in the diſſection of perſons who have been deſtroyed by the uſe of ardent ſpirits. They harden and contract the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bres of the ſtomach and bowels, or induce in them abſceſſes and gangrene—they produce ſchirri in the viſcera—they contract the diameter of the ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiferous and bronchial veſſels—they induce o<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications in the tendons, arteries, and pleura, and laſtly—they produce a peculiar criſpneſs in the hair of the head, inſomuch that the wig-makers in London give much leſs for it, than for the hair of ſober people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:026112_0069_0FCFF4EDEF6262E8"/>IF we advance a ſtep further and examine the effects of ſpirituous liquors upon the <hi>mind,</hi> the proſpect will be ſtill more diſtreſſing and terrible. Their firſt effects here, ſhew themſelves in the <hi>tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.</hi> I have conſtantly obſerved men who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxicated in any degree with ſpirits, to be peeviſh and quarrelſome; after a while they loſe by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees the <hi>moral</hi> ſenſe. They violate promiſes and engagements without ſhame or remorſe. From theſe deficiencies in veracity and integrity, they paſs on to crimes of a more heinous nature. It would diſhonour human nature only to name them.</p>
            <p>THE next operation of ardent ſpirits is upon the <hi>underſtanding.</hi> This ſublime power of the mind is firſt <hi>debilitated</hi> in hard drinkers.—They diſcover a torpor in every mental exertion, even when they are not under the immediate influence of ſpirits. To this debility in the underſtanding ſucceed the loſs of <hi>memory,</hi> and the <hi>perverſion</hi> of all the intellectual powers in <hi>melancholy</hi> and <hi>mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and in ſome caſes the total <hi>extinction</hi> of them in <hi>idiotiſm.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>LET us next turn our eyes from the effects of ſpirits upon the body and mind, to their effects up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>property</hi>; and here freſh ſcenes of miſery open to our view. Among the inhabitants of cities, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:026112_0070_0FCF497853E21A68"/>
debts, diſgrace, and bankruptcy. Among farmers, they produce idleneſs with its uſual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, ſuch as houſes without windows, barns without roofs, gardens without encloſures, fields without fences, hogs without yokes, ſheep without wool, meagre cattle, feeble horſes, and half clad dirty children, without principles, morals, or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners. This picture is not exaggerated. I appeal to the obſervations of my countrymen, whether ſuch ſcenes of wretchedneſs do not follow the tracks of ſpirituous liquors, in every part of the United States.</p>
            <p>THUS have I in a few words pointed out the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſpirituous liquors upon the bodies, minds, and eſtates of my fellow-citizens.—Their miſchiefs may be ſummed up in a few Words. They fill our church-yards with premature graves, they deface the image of God in the ſoul, they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>range or deſtroy the intellectual powers, they fill the ſheriff's docket with executions, they croud our hoſpitals with patients, and our jails with cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minals, they lead to places of public ignomy and puniſhment, and laſtly, they people the regions— but it belongs to another profeſſion to ſhew their terrible conſequences in the future world.</p>
            <p>AFTER this melancholy detail of the pernicious ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſpirituous liquors upon the body, it may not be
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:026112_0071_0FCFF4EFCA376AE0"/>
improper to enumerate the uſual cauſes which lead to their intemperate uſe. They are, 1. Expoſure to exceſſive heat and cold. 2. Hard labour, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proportioned to the ſtrength of the body. 3. Hunger, more eſpecially thoſe degrees of it which have been excited by long intervals between meals. 4. Long ſpeaking, or long ſittings in company. 5. Smoking and chewing tobacco. 6. Taking me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines in ardent ſpirits. 7. Breeding ſickneſs. 8. Great domeſtic care. I have of obſerved this cauſe to produce it, in ſeveral inſtances in women. 9. Domeſtic vexations, more eſpecially conjugal infelicity. 10. The infection of company that is addicted to ſtrong drink. 11. Debt. 12. The corrodings of a guilty conſcience; and, 13. Soli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude where the mind does not poſſeſs reſources in itſelf, in books, or religion. It is remarkable that an intemperate uſe of ardent spirits is ſeldom pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by that grief which follows the death of relations or friends.</p>
            <p>IN the uſe of ſpirits, there are certain progreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſtages which deſerve to be mentioned. Men begin generally by drinking them in a diluted ſtate, at dinner only. They next drink them in the ſame ſtate in the afternoon and evening. In the courſe of a few years, they call for them in the forenoon, and ſoon afterwards before breakfaſt, encreaſing their ſtrength from time to time until they finally
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:026112_0072_0FCFF4F333D535F8"/>
drink them in a undiluted ſtate during every hour of the night. I have known ſeveral perſons who have paſſed through all the above ſtages of intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, in whom the pulſe of life ſeemed to be ſupported for ſeveral months before their death, only by drinking from one to two quarts of raw ſpirits every night.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now proceed to combat ſome prejudices in favour of the uſe of ſprituous liquors.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>three</hi> occaſions in which ſpirits have been thought moſt neceſſary and uſeful are the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing:</p>
            <p n="1">1. IN very cold weather.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IN very warm weather. And,</p>
            <p n="3">3. IN times of hard labour.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THERE cannot be a greater error than to ſuppoſe that ſpirituous liquors leſſen the effects of cold upon the body. On the contrary, I main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that they always render the body more liable to be affected and injured by cold. The tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary warmth they produce, is always ſucceeded by chillineſs. If any thing, beſides warm cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and exerciſe, be neceſſary to warm the body in cold weather, a plentiful meal of wholſome food is
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:026112_0073_0FCFF4F44BDDCBC8"/>
at all times ſufficient for that purpoſe. This, by ſtimulating the ſtomach, invigorates the whole ſyſtem, and thus renders it leſs ſenſible of the cold.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT is equally abſurd to ſuppoſe that ſpirituous liquors leſſen the effects of heat upon the body. So far from it, they rather encreaſe them. They add an internal heat to the external heat of the ſun; they diſpoſe to fevers and inflammations of the moſt dangerous kind; they produce preterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſweats which weaken, inſtead of an uniform and gentle perſpiration, which exhilarates the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy. Half the diſeaſes which are ſaid to be produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by warm weather, I am perſuaded are produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced by the ſpirits which are ſwallowed to leſſen its effects upon the ſyſtem.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>"I aver from my own knowledge and cuſtom (ſays Dr. Moſely<note n="*" place="bottom">Diſeaſes of tropical climates.</note>) as well as the cuſtom and obſervations of many other people, that thoſe who drink nothing but <hi>water,</hi> or make it their principal drink, are but little affected by the climate, and can undergo the greateſt fatigue without inconvenience. Thoſe who uſe water for their common drink will never be ſubject to troubleſome or dangerous diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, and the only inconvenience attending water drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers is, that their appetite is ſo keen that they eat more than they ought."</p>
                  <p>"Rum (ſays Dr. Bell<note n="†" place="bottom">Inquiry into the cauſes which produce, and the means of preventing diſeaſes among Britiſh officers, ſoldiers, and others in the Weſt-Indies.</note>) whether uſed habitually, mode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately, or in exceſſive quantities, in the Weſt-Indies, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways diminiſhes the ſtrength of the body, and therefore renders the men more ſuſceptible of diſeaſe, and unfit for any ſervice in which vigor or activity are required.'</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="69" facs="unknown:026112_0074_0FCFF4F84532AC58"/>3. I maintain with equal confidence, that ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquors do not leſſen the effects of hard labour upon the body. Look at the horſe, with every muſcle of his body ſwelled from morning till night in the plough, or the team, does he make ſigns for ſpirits to enable him to cleave the earth, or to climb a hill?—No. He requires nothing but cool water and ſubſtantial food. There is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtrength nor nouriſhment in ſpirituous liquors. If they produce vigour in labour, it is of a tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent nature, and is always ſucceeded by a ſenſe of weakneſs and fatigue. Theſe facts are founded in obſervation; for I have repeatedly ſeen thoſe men perform the greateſt exploits in work both as to their degrees and duration, who never taſted ſpirituous liquors.</p>
            <p>BUT are there no conditions of the human bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy in which ſpirituous liquors are required? Yes,
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:026112_0075_0FCFF4FAAAB5CAC8"/>
there are; 1ſt. In thoſe caſes where the body has been exhauſted by any cauſes, and faintneſs, or a ſtoppage in the circulation of the blood has been produced, the ſudden ſtimulus of ſpirits may be neceſſary. In this caſe we comply ſtrictly with the advice of Solomon, who confines the uſe of "ſtrong drink," only to him "that is ready to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh!" and 2dly. When the body has been long expoſed to wet weather, and more eſpecially if cold be joined with it, a moderate quantity of ſpirits is not only proper but highly uſeful to obviate debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, and thus to prevent a fever. I take theſe to be the only two caſes that can occur, in which ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous liquors are innocent or neceſſary.</p>
            <p>BUT if we reject ſpirits from being part of our drinks, what liquors ſhall we ſubſtitute in the room of them? For cuſtom, the experience of all ages and countries, and even nature herſelf, all ſeem to demand drinks more grateful and more cordial than ſimple water.</p>
            <p>TO this I ſhall reply, by recommending in the room of ſpirits, in the firſt place,</p>
            <p n="1">1. CYDER. This excellent liquor contains a ſmall quantity of ſpirit, but ſo diluted and blunted, by being combined with an acid and a large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ſacharine matter and water, as to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:026112_0076_0FCFF4FBDBF16588"/>
inoffenſive and wholeſome. It diſagrees on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly with perſons ſubject to the rheumatiſm, but it may be rendered inoffenſive to ſuch people by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing a red hot iron in it, or by diluting it with water. It is to be lamented that the late froſts in the ſpring often deprive us of the fruit which affords this liquor. But the effects of theſe froſts have been in ſome meaſure obviated, by giving an orchard a north-weſt expoſure, ſo as to check too early vegetation, and by kindling two or three large fires of bruſh and ſtraw to the windward of the orchard, the evening before we expect a night of froſt. This laſt expedient, has in many inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces within the compaſs of my knowledge, preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the fruit of an orchard, to the great joy and emolument of the ingenious huſbandman.</p>
            <p n="2">2. BEER is a wholſome liquor compared with ſpirits. The grain from which it is obtained is not liable like the apple, to be affected by froſt, and therefore it can always be procured at a moderate expenſe. It abounds with nouriſhment—hence we find many of the common people in Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, endure hard labour with no other food than a quart or three pints of this liquor, with a few pounds of bread a-day.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WINE is likewiſe a wholeſome liquor, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with ſpirits. The low wines of France, I
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:026112_0077_0FCF49799576E368"/>
believe, could be drank at a leſs expence than ſpirits, in this country. The peaſants in France, who drink theſe liquors in large quantities, are a healthy and ſober body of people. Wines of all kinds yield, by chemical analyſis, the ſame principles as cyder, but in different proportions; hence they are both cordial and nouriſhing. It has been remarked, that few men ever become <hi>habitual</hi> drunkards up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on wine. It derives its reliſh principally from company, and is ſeldom, like ſpirituous liquors, drank in a chimney corner, or in a cloſet. The effects of wine upon the <hi>temper</hi> are likewiſe in moſt caſes, directly oppoſite to thoſe that were men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned of ſpirituous liquors. It muſt be a bad heart, indeed, that is not rendered more chearful and more generous, by a few glaſſes of wine<note n="*" place="bottom">If two barrels of cyder freſh from the preſs, are boiled into one, and afterwards fermented, and kept for two or three years in a dry cellar, it affords a liquor which (accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the quality of the apple from which the cyder is made) has the taſte of Malaga or Rheniſh wine. This liquor, when mixed with water, affords a very agreeable drink in ſummer. I have taken the liberty to call it <hi>Fomona wine.</hi> Another me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of obtaining a pleaſant wine from the apple, is to add to four and twenty gallons of new cyder, three gallons of a ſyrup made from the expreſſed juice of ſweet apples. When thoroughly fermented, and kept for ſome time, it becomes fit for uſe.</note>.</p>
            <p n="4">4. MELASSES and WATER compoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:026112_0078_0FCFF4FEB98D0070"/>
other excellent ſubſtitute for ſpirits. It is both cordial and nouriſhing.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The SUGAR MAPLE tree affords a thin JUICE in ſummer, which is cooling and refreſhing. It has long been uſed in Connecticut, for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the time of harveſt. The ſettlers in the weſtern counties of Pennſylvania and New-York, will do well to ſuffer a few of the trees which yield this pleaſant juice, to remain in all their fields. They may prove the means, not only of ſaving their children and grand-children many hundred pounds, but of ſaving their bodies from diſeaſe and death, and their ſouls from miſery beyond the grave.</p>
            <p n="6">6. VINEGAR and WATER ſweetened with ſugar or melaſſes, is an agreeable drink in warm weather. I beg leave to recommend this whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome liquor to reapers in a particular manner. It is pleaſant and cooling. It promotes perſpiration, and reſiſts putrefaction. Vinegar and water con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted the only drink of the ſoldiers of the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man republic; and it is well known that they marched and fought in a warm climate, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath a load of arms that weighed 60lbs. Boaz, a wealthy farmer in Paleſtine, we find, treated his reapers with nothing but bread dipped in vinegar.
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:026112_0079_0FCFF50489CCED28"/>
Under this head, I ſhould not neglect to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend BUTTER MILK and WATER, or SOUR MILK (commonly called bonneclabber) and WATER. It will be rendered more grateful by the addition of a little ſugar. PUNCH is likewiſe calculated to leſſen the effects of heat, and hard labour upon the body. The ſpirit in this liquor is blunted by its union with the vegetable acid. Hence it poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes, not only the conſtituent parts, but moſt of the qualities of cyder and wine. To render this liquor perfectly innocent and wholeſome, it muſt be drank <hi>weak,</hi> in <hi>moderate</hi> quantities, and <hi>only</hi> in warm weather. Say not, that ſpirits have become neceſſary in harveſt, from habit and the cuſtom of the country. The cuſtom of ſwallowing this li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quid fire, is a bad one, and the habit of it may be broken. Let half a dozen farmers in a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bourhood, combine to allow higher wages to their reapers than are common, and a ſufficient quantity of <hi>any</hi> of the liquors I have recommended, and they may ſoon aboliſh the practice of giving them ſpirits. They will in a little while be delighted with the good effects of their aſſociation. Their grain will be ſooner and more carefully gathered into their barns, and an hundred diſagreeable ſcenes of ſickneſs and contention will be avoided, which always follow in a greater or leſs degree the uſe of ſpirituous liquors.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="unknown:026112_0080_0FCFF50A264CFA38"/>TO enable the body to ſupport the waſte of its ſtrength by labour, the ſtomach ſhould be <hi>conſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,</hi> but <hi>moderately,</hi> ſtimulated by aliment of a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular kind. Labourers bear with great difficulty long intervals between their meals. They ſhould always eat four or five times a-day in time of har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, or at other ſeaſons of great bodily exertion. The food at theſe times ſhould be <hi>ſolid,</hi> conſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chiefly of ſalted meat. The vegetables uſed with it ſhould poſſeſs ſome activity. Onions and garlic are of a moſt cordial nature. Theſe vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables compoſed part of the diet which enabled the Iſraelites to endure, in a warm climate, the heavy taſks impoſed upon them by their Egyptian maſters. They were likewiſe eaten by the Roman farmers to repair the waſte of their ſtrength by the toils of harveſt. But further; There are certain SWEET SUBSTANCES which ſupport the body in labour. The negroes in the Weſt Indies grow fat and ſtrong by drinking the juice of the ſugar cane in the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of grinding it. The Jewiſh ſoldiers were invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gorated by occaſionally eating raiſins and figs. A bread compoſed of wheat flour, melaſſes, and gin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, (compoſing what is called ginger bread), and taken in ſmall quantities, during the day, is hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily calculated to obviate the debility which is ſo apt to be brought on by labour. All theſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, whether of an animal or vegetable nature,
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:026112_0081_0FCFF50C423892B0"/>
which have been mentioned, ſhould be uſed by la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring people. They leſſen the neceſſity for cordial drinks, and they impart <hi>equal</hi> and <hi>durable</hi> ſtrength to every part of the ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>THERE are certain claſſes of people to whom I beg leave to ſuggeſt a caution or two upon the uſe of ſpirituous liquors.</p>
            <p n="1">1. VALETUDINARIANS, eſpecially thoſe who la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour under diſorders of the ſtomach and bowels, are very apt to fly to ſpirits for relief. Let ſuch people be cautious how they repeat this dangerous re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy. I have known many men and women, of excellent characters and principles, who have been betrayed by occaſional doſes of gin or brandy to eaſe the cholic, into a love of ſpirituous liquors, inſomuch that they have afterwards fallen ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices to their fatal effects. The different prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of opium are a thouſand times more ſafe and innocent than ſpirituous liquors, in all ſpaſmodic affections of the ſtomach and bowels. So appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive am I of the danger of contracting a love for ſpirituous liquors, by accuſtoming the ſtomach to their ſtimules, that I think the fewer medicines we exhibit in ſpirituous vehicles the better.</p>
            <p n="2">2. SOME people, from living in countries ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the intermitting fever, endeavour to fortify
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:026112_0082_0FCF49806E7B75B8"/>
themſelves againſt it by two or three glaſſes of bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters made with ſpirits every day. There is great danger of men becoming ſots from this practice. Beſides, this mode of preventing intermittents is by no means a certain one. A much better ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt them is to be found in the Jeſuits bark. A tea-ſpoonful of this excellent medicine taken every morning during the ſickly ſeaſon, has in many inſtances preſerved whole families, in the neighbourhood of rivers and mill-ponds, from fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers of all kinds. If Jeſuits bark cannot be had, a gill or half a pint of a ſtrong infuſion of centaury, camomile, wormwood, or rue, in <hi>water,</hi> with a little calamus mixed with it, may be taken with nearly the ſame advantage as the bark, every morning. Thoſe who live in a ſickly pan of the country, and cannot procure the bark, or any of the bitters which have been mentioned, I would adviſe to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the morning and evening air in the ſickly months—to kindle fires in their houſes on damp days, and in cool evenings throughout the whole ſummer, and to put on woollen clothing about the firſt week in September. The laſt part of theſe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections applies only to the inhabitants of the middle ſtates. Theſe cautions, I am perſuaded, will be more effectual in preventing autumnal fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers than the beſt preparations that can be made from bitters in ſpirits.</p>

MEN, who follow profeſſions that require a conſtant exerciſe of the mind or body, or perhaps both, are very apt to ſeek relief from fatigue in ſpirituous liquors. To ſuch perſons I would beg leave to recommend the uſe of TEA inſtead of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits. This gentle ſtimulus, by reſtoring excite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, removes fatigue, and invigorates the whole ſyſtem. I am no advocate for the general or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive uſe of tea. When drank too ſtrong, it is hurtful, eſpecially to the female conſtitution; but when drank of a moderate degree of ſtrength, and in moderate quantities, with ſugar and cream, or milk, I believe it is in general innocent, and at all times to be preferred to ſpirituous liquors. An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thony Benezet, one of the moſt induſtrious ſchool-maſters I ever knew, told me that he had been preſerved from the love of ſpirituous liquors by contracting a love for tea in early life. Three or four diſhes taken in an afternoon, carried off the fatigue of a whole day's labour in his ſchool.

               <pb n="79" facs="unknown:026112_0084_0FCFF50FD0EAA0A0"/>TO every claſs of my readers, I beg leave to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt a caution againſt the uſe of TODDY. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that I have known ſome men, who, by limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its ſtrength conſtantly by meaſuring the ſpirit and water, and who by drinking it <hi>only</hi> at their <hi>meals,</hi> have drunken toddy for many years without ſuffering in any degree from it: but I have known many more who have been inſenſibly led from drinking toddy for their conſtant drink, to take drams in the morning, and have afterwards paid their lives as the price of their folly. I ſhall ſelect one caſe from among many, to ſhew the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary progreſs of intemperance in the uſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous liquors.—A gentleman, once of a fair and ſober character, in the city of Philadelphia, for many years drank toddy as his conſtant drink. From this he proceeded to drink grog. After a while nothing would ſatisfy him but ſlings made of equal parts of rum and water, with a little ſugar. From ſlings he advanced to raw rum—and from
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:026112_0085_0FCFF5130B01F288"/>
common rum to Jamaica ſpirits. Here he reſted for a few months; but at laſt, he found even Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica ſpirits were not ſtrong enough to warm his ſtomach, and he made it a conſtant practice to throw a table ſpoonful of ground pepper into each glaſs of his ſpirits, in order (to uſe his own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion) "to take of their coldneſs." It is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary to add, that he ſoon afterwards died a martyr to his own intemperance.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude what has been ſaid of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſpirituous liquors with two obſervations— 1. A people corrupted by ſtrong drink cannot long be a <hi>free</hi> people. The rulers of ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity will ſoon partake of the vices of that maſs from which they were ſecreted, and all our laws and governments will ſooner or later bear the ſame marks of the effects of ſpirituous liquors which were deſcribed formerly upon individuals. I ſubmit it therefore to the conſideration of our rulers, whether more laws ſhould not be made to increaſe the expenſe and leſſen the conſumption of ſpirituous liquors, and whether ſome mark of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic infamy ſhould not be inflicted by law upon every man, convicted before a common magiſtrate of drunkenneſs.</p>
            <p>THE ſecond and laſt obſervation I ſhall offer, is of a
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:026112_0086_0FCFF5145C60F420"/>
ſerious nature. It has been remarked, that the Indians have diminiſhed every where in America ſince their connections with the Europeans. This has been juſtly aſcribed to the Europeans having introduced ſpirituous liquors among them. Let thoſe men, who are every day turning their backs upon all the benefits of cultivated ſociety, to ſeek habitations in the neighbourhood of Indians, conſider how far this wandering mode of life is produced by the ſame cauſe which has ſcattered and annihilated ſo many Indian tribes. Long life, and the ſecure poſſeſſion of property, in the land of their anceſtors, were looked upon as bleſſings among the ancient Jews. For a ſon to mingle his duſt with the duſt of his father, was to act worthy of his inheritance; and the proſpect of this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour often afforded a conſolation even in death. However exalted, my countrymen, your ideas of liberty may be, while you expoſe yourſelves by the uſe of ſpirituous liquors to this conſequence of them, you are nothing more than the pioneers, or in more ſlaviſh terms, "the hewers of wood" of your more induſtrious neighbours.</p>
            <p>IF the facts that have been ſtated, have produced in any of my readers, who have ſuffered from the uſe of ſpirituous liquors, a reſolution to abſtain from them hereafter, I muſt beg leave to inform
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:026112_0087_0FCFF5176CAB1EA0"/>
them, that they muſt leave them off <hi>ſuddenly</hi> and <hi>entirely.</hi> No man was ever <hi>gradually</hi> reformed from drinking ſpirits. He muſt not only avoid taſting, but even ſmelling them, until long habits of abſtinence have ſubdued his affection for them. To prevent his feeling any inconveniences from the ſudden loſs of their ſtimulus upon his ſtomach, he ſhould drink plentifully of camomile or of any other bitter tea, or a few glaſſes of ſound old wine every day. I have great pleaſure in adding, that I have ſeen a number of people who have been <hi>effectually</hi> reſtored to health—to character—and to uſefulneſs to their families and to ſociety, by fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing this advice.</p>

            <head>INQUIRY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IN an Eſſay, entitled "Thoughts on the Pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Conſumption,"<note n="*" place="bottom">Medical Inquiries and Obſervations.</note> I attempted to ſhew that this diſorder was the effect of cauſes which indu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced general debility, and that the only hope of diſcovering a cure for it ſhould be directed to ſuch remedies as act upon the whole ſyſtem. In the following inquiry, I ſhall endeavour to eſtabliſh the truth of each of thoſe opinions, by a detail of facts and reaſonings, at which I only hinted in my former eſſay.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="86" facs="unknown:026112_0090_0FCFF52208AF9A30"/>THE method I have choſen for this purpoſe, is to deliver, and afterwards to ſupport, a few gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral propoſitions.</p>
            <p>I ſhall begin by remarking,</p>
            <p n="1">I. THAT the Pulmonary Conſumption is a diſeaſe of debility.</p>
            <p>THIS I infer, 1ſt, From the remote and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing cauſes which produce it. The remote cauſes are pneumony, catarrh, haemoptyſis, rheumatiſm, gout, aſthma, ſcrophula, nervous and intermitting fevers, meaſles, repelled humors from the ſurface of the body, the venereal diſeaſe, obſtructed men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſudden growth about the age of puberty, grief, and all other debilitating paſſions of the mind; hypochondriaſis, improper lactation, exceſſive eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of all kinds, more eſpecially by ſtool<note n="*" place="bottom">Sir George Baker relates in the ſecond volume of the Medical Tranſactions, that Dr. Blanchard had informed him that he had ſeen the conſumption brought on ten per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons out of ninety, by exceſſive purging uſed to prepare the body for the ſmall-pox. I have ſeen a caſe of conſumption in a youth of 17, from the ſpitting produced by the intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate uſe of ſegars.</note>, cold and damp air, external violence acting upon
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:026112_0091_0FCFF5234F48CFB0"/>
the body; <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Lind ſays that out of 360 patients whom he attended between July 1ſt, 1758, and July 1ſt, 1760, in conſumptions, the diſorder was brought on <hi>one fourth</hi> of them, by falls, bruiſes, and ſtrains received a year or two before the diſeaſe made its appearance.</note> and finally every thing that tends directly or indirectly to impair the vigor of the ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>THE moſt frequent exciting cauſe of conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is the alternate application of heat and cold to the whole external ſurface of the body, but all the remote cauſes which have been enumerated, ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate as exciting cauſes of conſumption when they act on previous debility. Original injuries of the lungs ſeldom induce this diſorder except they firſt induce a debility of the whole ſyſtem by a trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleſome and obſtinate cough.</p>
            <p n="2">2. FROM the occupations and habits of perſons who are moſt liable to this diſorder. Theſe are ſtudious men, and mechanics who lead ſedentary lives in confined places; alſo women, and all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of irritable habits, whether of body or mind.</p>
            <p n="3">3. FROM the period in which perſons are moſt liable to be affected by this diſorder. This is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:026112_0092_0FCFF524E87A78F8"/>
between the 18th and 36th year of life, a period in which the ſyſtem is liable in a peculiar manner to moſt diſeaſes which induce the diſorder, and in which indirect debility is oftener produced than in any other ſtage of life, by the exceſſive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of the body and mind in the purſuits of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs or pleaſure.</p>
            <p>I have conformed to authors, in fixing the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of conſumptions between the 18th and 36th year of life—but it is well known that it ſometimes appears in children, and frequently in perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the 40th, or even 50th year of life.</p>
            <p n="2">II. THE pulmonary conſumption is a primary diſeaſe of the <hi>whole</hi> ſyſtem. This I infer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. FROM the cauſes which produce it, acting upon the whole ſyſtem.</p>
            <p n="2">2. FROM the ſymptoms of general debility which always precede the affection of the lungs. Theſe ſymptoms are a quick pulſe, eſpecially to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards evening; a heat and burning in the palms of the hands; faintneſs, head-ach, ſickneſs at ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, and an occaſional diarrhoea. I have fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently obſerved each of theſe ſymptoms for ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral months before I have heard of a ſingle com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint in the breaſt.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="89" facs="unknown:026112_0093_0FCFF52F771E7170"/>3. FROM the pulmonary conſumption alterna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting with other diſeaſes which obviouſly belong to the whole ſyſtem. I ſhall briefly mention theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
            <p>THE RHEUMATISM. I have ſeen many caſes in which this diſeaſe and the conſumption have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternately, in different ſeaſons or years, affected the ſyſtem. In the winter of 1792, three clinical patients in the Pennſylvania hoſpital exemplified by their complaints the truth of this obſervation. They were relieved ſeveral times of a cough by pains in their limbs, and as often, the pains in their limbs ſeemed for a while to promiſe a cure to their pulmonic complaints.</p>
            <p>THE GOUT has often been obſerved to alternate with the pulmonary conſumption, eſpecially in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in the decline of life. Dr. Sydenham deſcribes a ſhort cough continuing through the whole win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as a ſymptom of gouty habits. A gentleman from Virginia died under my care in the ſpring of 1788, in the 45th year of his age, with all the ſymptoms of pulmonary conſumption, which had frequently alternated with pains and a ſwelling in his feet.</p>
            <p>THE pulmonary conſumption has been obſerved to alternate with MADNESS. Of this I have ſeen
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:026112_0094_0FCFF53222B2BC78"/>
two inſtances, in both of which, the cough, and expectoration were wholly ſuſpended during the continuance of the derangement of the mind. Dr. Mead mentions a melancholy caſe of the ſame kind in a young lady; and ſimilar caſes are to be met with in other authors. In all of them the diſeaſe proved fatal. In one of the caſes which came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my notice, the ſymptoms of conſumption re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned before the death of the patient.</p>
            <p>I have likewiſe witneſſed two caſes in which the return of reaſon after madneſs, was ſuddenly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by a fatal pulmonary conſumption. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the falſe hopes, and even the cheerfulneſs which ſo univerſally occur in this diſorder, may be reſolved into a morbid ſtate of the mind, produced by a general derangement of the whole ſyſtem. So univerſal are the deluſion and hopes of patients with reſpect to the nature and iſſue of this diſorder, that I have never met with but one man, who, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on being aſked what was the matter with him, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered unequivocally, "that he was in a conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion!"</p>
            <p>AGAIN—Dr. Bennet mentions a caſe of "A phthiſical patient who was ſeized with a violent PAIN IN THE TEETH for two days, and in whom, during that time, every ſymptom of a conſumption, except the leanneſs of the body, altogether van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed;"
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:026112_0095_0FCFF533DBA6F6D8"/>
and he adds further, "that a deſluxion on the lungs had often been relieved by SALIVA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RY EVACUATIONS."<note n="*" place="bottom">Treatiſe of the Nature and Cure of Conſumptions— Exercitation X.</note>
            </p>
            <p>I have ſeen ſeveral inſtances in which the pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monary ſymptoms have alternated with HEAD<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ACH and DYSPEPSIA,—alſo with pain and noiſe in one of the EARS. This affection of the ears ſometimes continues throughout the whole diſeaſe without any remiſſion of the pulmonary ſymptoms. I have ſeen one caſe of a diſcharge of matter from the left ear without being accompani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by either pain or noiſe.</p>
            <p>IN all our books of medicine are to be found caſes of conſumption alternating with ERUPTIONS ON THE SKIN.</p>
            <p>AND who has not ſeen the pulmonary ſymptoms alternately relieved, and reproduced by the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance or ceſſation of a diarrhoea, or pains in the BOWELS?</p>
            <p>TO theſe facts I ſhall only add, under this head, as a proof of the conſumption being a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of the whole ſyſtem, that it is always more or
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:026112_0096_0FCFF33B10331C28"/>
leſs relieved by the change which is induced in the ſyſtem by pregnancy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. I infer that the pulmonary conſumption is a diſeaſe of the whole ſyſtem from its analogy with ſeveral other diſeaſes which, though accompanied by local affections, are obviouſly produced by a morbid ſtate of the whole ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>THE Rheumatiſm, the Gout, the Meaſles, Small-pox, the different ſpecies of Cynanche—all furniſh examples of the connection of local affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with a general diſeaſe; but the APOPLEXY, and the PNEUMONY furniſh the moſt ſtriking analogies of local affection, ſucceeding a general diſorder of the ſyſtem in the pulmonary conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>THE moſt frequent cauſe of apoplexy is a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral debility of the ſyſtem, produced by intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in eating and drinking. The phaenomena of the diſeaſe are produced by an effuſion of blood or ſerum, in conſequence of a morbid diſtenſion, or of a rupture of the veſſels of the brain. The pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monary conſumption begins and ends in the ſame way, allowing only for the difference of ſituation and ſtructure of the brain and lungs. After the production of prediſpoſing debility from the action of the remote cauſes formerly enumerated, the fluids are determined to the weakeſt part of the
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:026112_0097_0FCFF33EC38BFD50"/>
body. Hence effuſions of ſerum or blood take place in the lungs. When ſerum is effuſed, a pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuitous or purulent expectoration alone takes place; —when blood is diſcharged, a diſeaſe is produced which has been called Haemoptyſis. An effuſion of blood in the brain, brought on by the operation of general debility, has been called by Dr. Hoff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, with equal propriety, a haermorrhage of the brain. The effuſion of blood in the lungs in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of the rupture of a blood veſſel is leſs fatal than the ſame accident when it occurs in the brain, only becauſe the blood in the former caſe is more eaſily diſcharged from the ſyſtem. Where no rupture of a blood veſſel is produced, death is nearly as ſpeedy and certain in the one caſe as in the other.<note n="*" place="bottom">I have ſeen two caſes of ſudden death from Hemoptyſis. In one of them there was very little blood diſcharged through the mouth.</note> Diſſections ſhow many caſes of ſuffocation and and death, from the lungs being preternaturally fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with blood or ſerum. From this great analo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy between the remote and proximate cauſes of the two diſeaſes which have been deſcribed, I have taken the liberty to call them both by the name of apoplexy. The only ſymptom which does not accord with the derivation of the term, is, that in the apoplexy of the lungs, the patient does not fall
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:026112_0098_0FCFF34273F711F0"/>
down as if by an external ſtroke, which is moſt frequently the caſe in the apoplexy of the brain.</p>
            <p>THE hiſtory of the remote and proximate cauſes of pneumony will furniſh us with a ſtill more re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable analogy of the connection between a <hi>lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal</hi> affection, and a <hi>general</hi> diſeaſe of the ſyſtem. The pneumony is produced by remote exciting cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, which act on the whole ſyſtem. The whole arterial ſyſtem is frequently agitated by a fever in this diſorder before a pain is perceived in the breaſt or ſides, and this fever generally conſtitutes the ſtrength and danger of the diſeaſe. The expectoration which terminates the diſorder in health, is always the effect of effuſions pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by a general diſeaſe, and even the vomicas, which ſometimes ſucceed a deficiency of bleeding in this diſorder, always depend upon the ſame ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral cauſe. From this view of the analogy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween pneumony and pulmonary conſumption, it would ſeem that the two diſeaſes differed from each other only by the ſhorter or longer operation of the cauſes which induce them, and by the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or leſs violence and duration of their ſymptoms. The pnuemony appears to be an <hi>acute</hi> conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the conſumption a <hi>chronic</hi> pneumony. From the analogy of the pulmonary conſumption
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:026112_0099_0FCFF345C6478758"/>
with the diminutive term of certain fevers, I have taken the liberty of calling it a PNEUMONICULA.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I infer that the pulmonary conſumption is a diſeaſe of the whole ſyſtem, from its exiſtence without ulcers in the lungs. Of this there are many caſes recorded in books of medicine.</p>
            <p>DR. Leigh informs us in his natural hiſtory of Lancaſhire, that the conſumption was a very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon diſeaſe on the ſea coaſt of that country; but that it was not accompanied either by previous inflammation or ulcers in the lungs. It was general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attended, he ſays, by an unuſual peeviſhneſs of temper.</p>
            <p n="6">6. AND laſtly, I infer, that the pulmonary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is a diſeaſe of the whole ſyſtem, from its being relieved, or cured, only by remedies which act upon the whole ſyſtem. This will appear, I hope, hereafter, when we come to treat of the cure of this diſorder.</p>
            <p>LET us now inquire how far the principles I have laid down will apply to the ſuppoſed proximate cauſes of conſumption. Theſe cauſes have been ſaid to be—an abſceſs in the lungs, haemoptyſis, tubercles, catarrh, hereditary diatheſis, contagion, and the matter of cutaneous eruptions or ſores re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled,
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:026112_0100_0FCFF34868E7EC80"/>
and thrown upon the lungs. I ſhall make a few obſervations upon each of them.</p>
            <p n="1">1. AN abſceſs in the lungs is generally the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of a neglected, or half cured pneumony. It is ſeldom fatal, where it is not connected with a prediſpoſition to conſumption from general debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, or where general debility is not previouſly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the want of appetite, ſleep, and exerciſe, which ſometimes accompanies that diſorder of the lungs. This explanation of the production of conſumption by an abſceſs in the lungs, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive further ſupport from attending to the effects of wounds in the lungs. How ſeldom are they followed by pulmonary conſumption; and this only becauſe they are as ſeldom accompanied by prediſpoſing general debility. I do not recollect a ſingle inſtance of this diſorder having followed a wound in the lungs, either by the bayonet, or a bullet, during the late war. The recoveries which have ſucceeded ſuch wounds, and frequently un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the moſt unfavorable circumſtances, ſhew how very improbable it is that a much ſlighter affection of the lungs ſhould become the cauſe of a pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conſumption.</p>
            <p>A Britiſh officer, whom I met in the Britiſh camp, a few days after the battle of Brandywine, in
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:026112_0101_0FCFF34C2D7AD280"/>
September, 1777, informed me that the ſurgeon general of the royal army had aſſured him, that out of twenty-four ſoldiers who had been admitted into the hoſpitals, during the campaign of 1776, with wounds in their lungs, twenty-three of them had recovered. Even primary diſeaſes of the lungs often exiſt with peculiar violence, or conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue for many years without inducing a conſumpti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. I have never known but one inſtance of the hooping cough ending in conſumption, and all our books of medicine contain records of the aſth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma continuing for 20 and 30 years without termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating in that diſorder. The reaſon in both caſes, muſt be aſcribed to thoſe two original diſorders of the lungs not being accompanied by general debility. One fact more will ſerve to throw ſtill further light upon the ſubject. Millers are much afflicted with a cough from floating particles of flour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly irritating their lungs, and yet they are not more ſubject to conſumptions than other labouring people. Hence "a miller's cough," is proverbial in ſome places, to denote a cough of long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance without danger.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE haemoptyſis is either a local diſeaſe, or it is the effect of general debility of the whole ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem. When it is local, or when it is the effect of cauſes which induce a <hi>temporary</hi> or <hi>acute</hi> debility
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:026112_0102_0FCFF34DD281D6B8"/>
only in the ſyſtem, it is ſeldom followed by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. The accidental diſcharge of blood from the lungs, from injuries, and from an obſtruction of the menſes in women, is of this kind. Many perſons are affected by this ſpecies of haemorrhage once or twice in their lives, without ſuffering any inconvenience from it afterwards. I have met with ſeveral caſes in which it has occurred for many years every time the body was expoſed to any of the cauſes which induce <hi>ſudden,</hi> direct, or indirect debility, and yet no conſumption has fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed it. The late king of Pruſſia informed Dr. Zimmerman that he had been frequently attacked by it during his ſeven years war, and yet he lived notwithſtanding above twenty years afterwards without any pulmonary complaints. It is only in perſons who labour under <hi>chronic</hi> debility, that an haemoptyſis is neceſſarily followed by conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p n="3">3. I yield to the popular mode of expreſſion when I ſpeak of a conſumption being produced by tubercles. But I maintain that they are the <hi>effects</hi> of general debility communicated to the bronchial veſſels which cauſe them to effuſe a preternatural quantity of mucus. This mucus is ſometimes poured into the trachea from whence it is diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by hawking, more eſpecially in the morning;
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:026112_0103_0FCFF34F81D0D030"/>
for it is effuſed more copiouſly during the languid hours of ſleep than in the day time. But this mucus is frequently effuſed into the ſubſtance of the lungs, where it produces thoſe tumours we call tubercles. When this occurs, there is either no cough<note n="*" place="bottom">See Med. Com. Vol. II.</note> or a very dry one. That tubercles are formed in this way, I infer from the diſſections and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Dr. Stark<note n="†" place="bottom">Clinical and Anatomical Obſervations, p. 26, 27. See alſo Morgagni, letter xxii. 21.</note>, who tells us, that he found them to conſiſt of inorganic matter—that he was unable to diſcover any connection between them and the pulmonary veſſels, by means of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croſcope or injections, and that they firſt opened into the trachea through the bronchial veſſels. It is remarkable that the color and conſiſtence of the matter of which they are compoſed, is nearly the ſame as the matter which is diſcharged from the trachea, in the moſt cough which occurs from a relaxation of the bronchial veſſels.</p>
            <p>I am aware that theſe tumours in the lungs have been aſcribed to ſcropula. But the frequent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of conſumptions in perſons in whom no ſcrophulous taint exiſted, is ſufficient to refute this opinion. I have frequently directed my enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries after this diſorder in conſumptive patients, and
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:026112_0104_0FCF4948D7BDF508"/>
have met with very few caſes which were produced by it. It is probable that it may frequently be a prediſpoſing cauſe of conſumption in Great Britain, but I am ſure it is not in the United States of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE catarrh is of two kind—acute and chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic, both of which are connected with general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, but this debility is moſt obvious in the chronic catarrh: hence we find it encreaſed by every thing which acts upon the whole ſyſtem, ſuch as cold and damp weather, fatigue, and above all by old age, and relieved or cured by exerciſe, and every thing elſe which invigorates the whole ſyſtem. This ſpecies of catarrh often continues for twenty or thirty years without inducing pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conſumption, in perſons who purſue active occupations.</p>
            <p n="5">5. IN the hereditary conſumption there is either an hereditary debility of the whole ſyſtem, or an hereditary mad-conformation of the breaſt. In the latter caſe, the conſumption is the effect of weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs communicated to the whole ſyſtem, by the long continuance of difficult reſpiration, or of ſuch injuries being done to the lungs as are incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with health and life. It is remarkable, that
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:026112_0105_0FCFF3549374E948"/>
the conſumptive diatheſis is more frequently deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from paternal than maternal anceſtors.</p>
            <p n="6">6. PHYSICIANS the moſt diſtinguiſhed for accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate obſervations have agreed, that the pulmonary conſumption may be communicated by contagion. However doubtful it may be in temperate, it can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be controverted in warm climates. Morgagni informs us that, Valſalva (who was prediſpoſed to the conſumption) was ſo ſatisfied of its contagious nature, that he conſtantly avoided being preſent at the diſſection of the lungs of perſons who had died of that diſorder. I know that its progreſs in whole families has been aſcribed to a ſameneſs of original conſtitution, or mal-conformation of the breaſt in the members of the ſame family, or the fatigue which is incurred by attending, and the grief which follows the loſs of relations who periſh by that diſorder. Perhaps many of the caſes of conſumption, which have been aſcribed to conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, may be accounted for by calling in the debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litating operation of one or both of thoſe cauſes; but there are caſes of the diſeaſe being communicated by contagion, which cannot be reſolved into the influence of either fatigue or grief.</p>
            <p>THE late Dr. Beardſley, of Connecticut, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me that he had known ſeveral black ſlaves,
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:026112_0106_0FCFF35E6F3484B8"/>
affected by a conſumption which had previouſly ſwept away ſeveral of the white members of the family to which they belonged. In thoſe ſlaves no ſuſpicion was entertained of the moſt diſtant relationſhip to the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from whom they had had contracted the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; nor had fatigue or grief, from the cauſes be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forementioned, been ſuppoſed to have had the leaſt ſhare in debilitating their bodies. Admitting then contagion to act as a remote cauſe of conſumption, it does not militate againſt the theory which I have aimed to eſtabliſh; for if the contagion follow the analogy of all the other contagions that we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with, it muſt act by debilitating the whole ſyſtem. The approach of the jail fever and the plague is often indicated by general languor. The influenza and the meaſles are always accompanied by general debility, but the ſmall pox furniſhes an analogy to the caſe in queſtion more directly in point. The contagion of this diſorder, whether received by the medium of the air or the ſkin, never fails of producing a diſeaſe of the whole ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem, before it diſcovers itſelf in affections of thoſe parts of the body on which the contagion pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced its firſt operation.—I am diſpoſed to believe, from ſeveral caſes which have come under my no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, that the contagion which produces the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption ſeldom acts in leſs than two or three months after it is received into the ſyſtem. I once
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:026112_0107_0FCFF360F042EF48"/>
attended a lady, in whom the contagion did not diſcover itſelf in the lungs for nearly a year after ſhe had been expoſed to it, by attending a ſiſter who had died of the conſumption. In this caſe the effects of fatigue, and of grief were entirely worn away from the ſyſtem by time, as well as by chearful ſociety.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I GRANT that cutaneous humors, and the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of old ſores, when repelled, or ſuddenly healed, have in ſome caſes fallen upon the lungs, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced conſumption. But I believe, in every caſe where this has happened, the conſumption was preceded by general debility, or that it was not induced, until the whole ſyſtem had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly debilitated by a tedious and diſtreſſing cough.</p>
            <p>IF the reaſonings founded upon the facts which have been mentioned be juſt, then it follows,</p>
            <p n="3">III. THAT the cough, tubercles, ulcers, and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rulent or bloody diſcharges which occur in the pulmonary conſumption, are the <hi>effects</hi> and not the <hi>cauſes</hi> of the diſeaſe; and, that all attempts to cure it, by inquiring after tubercles and ulcers, or into the quality of the diſcharges from the lungs, are as fruitleſs as an attempt would be to diſcover the cauſes or cure of dropſies, by an examination of the
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:026112_0108_0FCFF36636492FB0"/>
qualities of collections of water, or to find out the cauſes and cure of fevers by the quantity or qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the diſcharges which take place in thoſe diſeaſes from the kidneys and ſkin. I admit that the cough, ulcers, and tubercles, after they are formed, increaſe the danger of the diſeaſe, by be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming new cauſes of ſtimulus to the ſyſtem, but in this they are upon a footing with thoſe effuſions in the viſcera, which take place in the intermitting fever, which though they conſtitute no part of its cauſe, frequently produce ſymptoms and a termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which are wholly unconnected with the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>THE tendency of general debility to produce a diſeaſe of the lungs appears in many caſes, as well as in the pulmonary conſumption. Dr. Lind tells us, that the laſt ſtage of the jail fever was often marked by a cough. I have ſeldom been diſappointed in looking for a cough and a copious excretion of mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus and phlegm after the 14th or 15th days of the nervous fever. Two caſes of hypocondriaſis under my care, ended in fatal diſorders of the lungs. The debility of old age is generally accompanied by a troubleſome cough, and the debility which precedes death, generally diſcovers its laſt ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms in the lungs,—hence, moſt people die with what are called the <hi>Rattles.</hi> They are produced
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:026112_0109_0FCFF36752BFF510"/>
by a ſudden and copious effuſion of mucus in the bronchial veſſels of the lungs.</p>
            <p>SHOULD it be aſked, why does general debility terminate by a diſorder in the lungs, rather than in any other part of the body?—I anſwer,—that it ſeems to be a law of the ſyſtem, that general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility ſhould always produce as a ſymptom ſome local diſeaſe. This local diſeaſe ſometimes mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſts itſelf in dyſpepſia, as in the general debility which follows grief;—ſometimes it diſcovers it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in a diarrhoea as in the general debility which ſucceeds to fear.—Again it appears in the brain,—as in the general debility which ſucceeds intemperance, and the conſtant or violent exerciſe of the underſtanding, or of ſtimulating paſſions; but it more frequently appears in the lungs, as the conſequence of general debility. It would ſeem as if the debility in the caſes of conſumption is ſeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chiefly in the blood veſſels, while that debility which terminates in diſeaſes of the ſtomach and bowels, is confined chiefly to the nerves,—and that the local affections of the brain ariſe from a debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, invading alike the nervous and arterial ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtems. What makes it more probable, that the arterial ſyſtem is <hi>materially</hi> affected in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption is, that the diſorder moſt frequently oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs in thoſe periods of life, and in thoſe habits in
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:026112_0110_0FCFF369A562C148"/>
which a peculiar ſtate of irritability or excitability is ſuppoſed to be preſent in the arterial ſyſtem; alſo in thoſe climates in which there are the moſt frequent viciſſitudes in the temperature of the weather. It is remarkable, that that the debility in the inhabitants of the Weſt Indies, whether produced by the heat of the climate, or the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive purſuits of buſineſs or pleaſure, generally terminates in dropſy, or in ſome diſorder of the alimentary canal.</p>
            <p>I HAVE ſaid, that it ſeemed to be a law of the ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem, that general debility ſhould always produce as a ſymptom ſome local affection. But to this law there are ſometimes exceptions: The Atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy appears to be a conſumption without an affection of the lungs.—This diſorder is frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly mentioned by the writers of the 16th and 17th centuries by the name of Tabes. I have ſeen ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtances of it in adults, but more in children, and a greater number in the children of black than of white parents. The hectic fever, and even the night ſweats, were as obvious in ſeveral of theſe caſes, as in thoſe conſumptions where general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility had diſcovered itſelf in an affection of the lungs.</p>
            <p>I COME now to make a few obſervations upon
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:026112_0111_0FCFF36E29BC20B8"/>
the CURE of conſumption; and here I hope it will appear, that the theory which I have delivered admits of an early and very important application to practice.</p>
            <p>IF the conſumption be a diſeaſe of general de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, it becomes us to attempt the cure of it in its firſt ſtage,—that is, before it produce the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of cough, bloody or purulent diſcharges from the lungs, and inflammatory or hectic fever. The ſymptoms which mark this firſt ſtage, are too ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom obſerved; or if obſerved, they are too often treated with equal neglect by patients and phyſici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans. I ſhall briefly enumerate theſe ſymptoms. They are a ſlight fever encreaſed by the leaſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe,—a burning and dryneſs in the palms of the hands, more eſpecially towards evening,—rheumy eyes upon waking from ſleep,—an encreaſe of urine,—a dryneſs of the ſkin, more eſpecially of the feet in the morning,<note n="*" place="bottom">The three laſt mentioned ſymptoms are taken notice of by Dr Bennet, in his Treatiſe upon the Nature and Cure of the Conſumption as <hi>precurſors</hi> of the diſorder. Dr. Boerhaave uſed to tell his pupils that they had never deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him.</note>—an occaſional fluſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in one, and ſometimes in both cheeks,—
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:026112_0112_0FCF494D761B0B30"/>
a hoarſeneſs<note n="†" place="bottom">I have ſeen the <hi>hoarſeneſs</hi> in one caſe the firſt ſymptom of approaching conſumption. In this ſymptom it preſerves the analogy of pneumony, which often comes on with a hoarſeneſs, and ſometimes with paraphonia.</note>—a ſlight or acute pain in the breaſt, —a fixed pain in one ſide, or ſhooting pains in both ſides,—head-ach,—occaſional ſick and fainty fits,—a deficiency of appetite, and a general indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to exerciſe or motion of every kind.</p>
            <p>IT would be eaſy for me to mention caſes in which every ſymptom that has been enumerated has occurred within my own obſervations. I wiſh them to be committed to memory by young prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titioners; and if they derive the ſame advantages from attending to them, which I have done, I am ſure they will not regret the trouble they have taken for that purpoſe. It is probable, while a morbid ſtate of the lungs is ſuppoſed to be the proximate cauſe of this diſorder, they will not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive much reputation or emolument from curing it in its forming ſtage; but let them remember, that in all attempts to diſcover the cauſes and cures of diſeaſes, which have been deemed incurable, a phyſician will do nothing effectual until he acquire a perfect indifference to his own intereſt and fame.</p>
            <p>THE remedies for conſumption in this ſtage of the diſorder are ſimple and certain. They conſiſt,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:026112_0113_0FCFF370CC0550F8"/>
in a deſertion of all the remote, and exciting cauſes of the diſorder, particularly ſedentary em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, damp or cold ſituations, and whatever tends to weaken the ſyſtem. When the diſeaſe has not yielded to this deſertion of its remote and exciting cauſes, I have recommended the <hi>cold bath, ſteel,</hi> and <hi>bark</hi> with great advantage. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever improper or even dangerous theſe remedies may be after the diſeaſe aſſumes an inflammatory or hectic type, and produces an affection of the lungs, they are perfectly ſafe and extremely uſeful in the ſtate of the ſyſtem which has been deſcrib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The uſe of the bark will readily be admitted by all thoſe practitioners who believe the pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conſumption to depend upon a ſcrophulous diatheſis. Should even the lungs be affected by ſcrophulous tumors, it is no objection to the uſe of the bark; for there is no reaſon why it ſhould not be as uſeful in ſcrophulous tumors of the lungs, as of the glands of the throat, provided it be given before thoſe tumors have produced inflammation; and in this caſe, no prudent practitioner will ever preſcribe it in ſcrophula when ſeated even in the external parts of the body. To theſe remedies ſhould be added a diet moderately ſtimulating, and gentle exerciſe. I ſhall hereafter mention the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſpecies of exerciſe, and the manner in which each of them ſhould be uſed ſo as to derive the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:026112_0114_0FCFF3724D808EE8"/>
advantage from them. I can ſay nothing of the uſe of ſalt-water, or ſea-air in this ſtage of the conſumption from my own experience. I have heard them commended by a phyſician of Rhode-Iſland; and if they be uſed before the diſeaſe has diſcovered itſelf in pulmonary affections, I can eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conceive they may do ſervice.</p>
            <p>IF the ſimple remedies which have been men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned have been neglected, in the firſt ſtage of the diſorder, it generally terminates in different peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods of time, in pulmonary affections; which ſhew themſelves under one of the three following forms.—</p>
            <p n="1">1. A fever, accompanied by a cough, a hard pulſe, and a diſcharge of blood, or mucous mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the lungs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A fever of the hectic kind, accompanied by chilly fits, and night ſweats, and a pulſe full, quick, and occaſionally hard. The diſcharges from the lungs in this ſtate of the diſorder, are frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purulent.</p>
            <p n="3">3. A fever with a weak quick pulſe, a trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome cough, and copious purulent diſcharges from the lungs, a hoarſe and weak voice, and chilly fits
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:026112_0115_0FCFF3736381FF10"/>
and night ſweats, alternating occaſionally with a diarrhoea.</p>
            <p>THESE three different forms of the pulmonary affection have been diſtinguiſhed by the names of the firſt, ſecond, and third ſtages of the conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but as they do not always ſucceed each other in the order in which they have been mentioned, I ſhall hereafter diſtinguiſh them by the name of ſpecies, in conformity to our modern nomencla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of medicine, although it would be more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, on ſome accounts, to conſider them as differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſtates of the ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>THE firſt I ſhall call the INFLAMMATORY—the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond the HECTIC, and the third the TYPHUS ſpecies. I have ſeen the pulmonary conſumption come on ſometimes with all the ſymptoms of the ſecond, and ſometimes with the moſt of the ſymptoms of the third ſpecies; and I have ſeen two caſes in which a hard pulſe, and other ſymptoms of inflammatory ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion appeared in the laſt hours of life. It is agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to purſue the analogy of this diſorder with a pneumony, or an acute inflammation of the lungs. They both make their firſt appearance in the ſame ſeaſons of the year. It is true, the pneumony moſt frequently attacks with inflammatory ſymptoms; but it ſometimes occurs with ſymptoms which for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:026112_0116_0FCFF374F93441B0"/>
blood-letting, and I have more than once ſeen it attended by ſymptoms which required the uſe of wine and bark. The pneumony is attended at firſt by a dry cough, and an expectoration of ſtreaks of blood—the cough in the conſumption, in like manner, is at firſt dry, and attended by a diſcharge of blood from the lungs, which is more copious than in the pneumony, only becauſe the lungs are more relaxed in the former than in the latter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. There are caſes of pneumony in which no cough attends. I have ſeen caſes of pulmona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſumption, in which nothing but a difficulty of breathing diſcovered a morbid ſtate of the lungs, and one in which there was an entire abſence of cough.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>In the year 1785, I attended a young lady who had complained of a pain in her right ſide, and had frequent chills with a fever of the hectic kind. They all gave way 10 frequent and gentle bleedings. In the ſummer of 1786, ſhe was ſeized with the ſame complaints, and as ſhe had great objections to bleeding, ſhe conſulted a phyſician who grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied her, by attempting to cure her by recommending exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and country air. In the autumn ſhe returned to the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty much worſe than when ſhe left it. I was again ſent for, and found her confined to her bed with a pain in her right ſide, but without the leaſt cough or fever. Her pulſe was preternaturally ſlow. She could lie only on her left ſide. She ſometimes complained of acute flying pains in her head, bowels, and limbs. About a month before her death, which was on the 3d of May 1787, her pulſe became quick, and ſhe had a little hecking cough, but without any diſcharge from her lungs. Upon my firſt viſit to her in the preceding autumn, I had told her friends that I believed ſhe had an abſceſs in her lungs. The want of fever and cough afterwards how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever gave me reaſon to ſuſpect that I had been miſtaken. The morning after her death, I received a meſſage from her father, informing me that it had been among the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts of his daughter, that the cauſe of her death ſhould be aſcertained by my opening her body. I complied with this requeſt, and in company with Dr. Hall, examined her tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rax. We found the left lobe of the lungs perfectly ſound; the right lobe adhered to the pleura, in ſeparating of which, Dr. Hall plunged his hand into a large ſac which contained about half a pint of purulent matter, and which had nearly deſtroyed the whole ſubſtance of the right lobe of the lungs.</p>
                  <p>I have met with only two other caſes of conſumption in which there was an abſence of a <hi>quick</hi> pulſe. In both of them the pulſe was regular to the laſt day of life.</p>

               <pb n="113" facs="unknown:026112_0117_0FCFF3764E4D1E18"/>THE pneumony terminates in different periods according to the degrees of inflammation, or the nature of the effuſions which take place in the lungs—the ſame obſervation applies to the pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conſumption. The ſymptoms of the different ſpecies of pneumony frequently run into each o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſo do the ſymptoms of the three ſpecies of conſumption which have been mentioned. In ſhort, the pneumony and conſumption are alike in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:026112_0118_0FCFF37804B36268"/>
particulars, that they appear to reſemble ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows of the ſame ſubſtance. They differ only as the protracted ſhadow of the evening does from that of the noon-day ſun.</p>
            <p>I KNOW that it will be objected here that the conſumption is ſometimes produced by ſcrophula, and that this creates an eſſential difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween it and pneumony. I formerly admitted ſcrophula to be one of the <hi>remote</hi> cauſes of the conſumption; but this does not invalidate the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel which has been given of the two diſeaſes. The phenomena produced in the lungs are the ſame as to their nature, whether they be produced by the remote cauſe of ſcrophula, or by the ſudden action of cold and heat upon them.</p>
            <p>NO more happens in the caſes of acute and chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic pneumony, than what happens in dyſentery and rheumatiſm. Theſe two laſt diſeaſes are for the moſt part ſo acute, as to confine the patient to his bed or his room, yet we often meet with both of them in patients who go about their ordinary bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and, in ſome inſtances, carry their diſeaſes with them for two or three years.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="unknown:026112_0119_0FCFF37969E82258"/>THE parallel which has been drawn between the pneumony and conſumption, will enable us to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the reaſon why the latter diſorder termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nates in ſuch different periods of time. The leſs it partakes of pneumony, the longer it continues, and vice verſa. What is commonly called in this country a <hi>galloping</hi> conſumption, is a diſeaſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded of different degrees of conſumption and pneumony. It terminates frequently in two or three months, and without many of the ſymptoms which uſually attend the laſt ſtage of pulmonary conſumption. But there are caſes in which pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients in a conſumption are ſuddenly ſnatched away by an attack of pneumony. I have met with one caſe only, in which, contrary to my expectation, the patient mended after an attack of an acute in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the lungs, ſo as to live two years afterwards.</p>
            <p>IT would ſeem from theſe facts, as if nature had preferred a certain gradation in diſeaſes, as well as in other parts of her works. There is ſcarcely a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in which there is not a certain number of grades, which mark the diſtance between health and the loweſt ſpecific deviation from it. Each of theſe grades has received different names, and has been conſidered as a diſtinct diſeaſe, but more accurate ſurveys of the animal oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:026112_0120_0FCFF37B536149D8"/>
have taught us, that they frequently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the ſame original cauſes, and that they are only greater or leſs degrees of the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe.</p>
            <p>I SHALL now proceed to ſay a few words upon the cure of the different ſpecies of pulmonary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. The remedies for this purpoſe are of two kinds, viz. PALLIATIVE and RADICAL. I ſhall firſt mention the palliative remedies which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to each ſpecies, and then mention thoſe which are alike proper in them all. The palliative re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies for the</p>
            <p n="1">I. OR INFLAMMATORY SPECIES, ARE</p>
            <p n="1">1. BLOOD-LETTING. It may ſeem ſtrange to recommend this debilitating remedy in a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe brought on by debility. Were it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in this place, I could prove that there is no diſeaſe in which bleeding is preſcribed, which is not induced by prediſpoſing debility in commmon with the pulmonary conſumption. I ſhall only remark here, that in conſequence of the exciting cauſe acting upon the ſyſtem (rendered extremely excitable by debility) ſuch a morbid and exceſſive excitement is produced in the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries as to render a diminution of the ſtimulus of
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:026112_0121_0FCFF37D0FE13750"/>
the blood, abſolutely neceſſary to reduce it. I have uſed this remedy with great ſucceſs in every caſe of conſumption, attended by a hard pulſe, or a pulſe rendered weak by a laborious tranſmiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the blood through the lungs. In the months of February and March in the year 1781, I bled a Methodiſt miniſter, who was affected by this ſpecies of conſumption, fifteen times in the courſe of ſix weeks. The quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of blood drawn at each bleeding was never leſs than eight ounces, and it was at all times co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered with an inflammatory cruſt. By the addition of country air, and moderate exerciſe, to this copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous evacuation, in the enſuing ſpring he recovered his health, ſo perfectly as to diſcharge all the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of his profeſſion for many years, nor was he ever afflicted afterwards with a diſorder in his breaſt. I have in another inſtance, bled a citizen of Philadelphia eight times in two weeks, in this ſpecies of conſumption, and with the happieſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects. The blood drawn at each bleeding was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ſizy, and never leſs in quantity than ten ounces. To theſe caſes I might add many others of conſumptive perſons who have been perfectly cured by frequent, and of many others whoſe lives have been prolonged by occaſional bleedings.— But I am ſorry to add, that I could relate many more caſes of conſumptive patients, who have died
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:026112_0122_0FCFF37F55A99BC8"/>
martyrs to their prejudices againſt the uſe of this invaluable remedy. A common objection to it is, that it has been uſed without ſucceſs in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order. When this has been the caſe, I ſuſpect that it has been uſed in one of the other two ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of pulmonary conſumption which have been mentioned, for it has unfortunately been too fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhionable among phyſicians to preſcribe the ſame remedies in every ſtage and ſpecies of the ſame diſorder; and this I take to be the reaſon why the ſame medicines, which in the hands of ſome phyſicians, are either inert, or inſtruments of miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief, are, in the hands of others, uſed with more or leſs ſucceſs in every caſe in which they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. Another objection to bleeding in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory ſpecies of conſumption, is derived from the apparent and even ſenſible weakneſs of the patient. The men who urge this objection, do not heſitate to take from ſixty to an hundred ounces of bood from a patient in a pneumony in in the courſe of five or ſix days, without conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the debility in the latter caſe is ſuch as to confine a patient to his bed, while in the former caſe, the patient's ſtrength is ſuch as to enable him to walk about his houſe, and even to attend to his ordinary buſineſs. The difference between the debility in the two diſeaſes, conſiſts in its being <hi>acute</hi> in the one, and <hi>chronic</hi> in the other. It is
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:026112_0123_0FCFF380D09481C0"/>
true, the preternatural or convulſive action of the arteries is ſomewhat greater in the pneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, than in the inflammatory conſumption; but the plethora on which the neceſſity of bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is partly founded, is certainly greater in the inflammatory conſumption than in pneumony.— This is evident from women, and even nurſes, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging from four to ſix ounces of menſtrual blood every month, while they are labouring with the moſt inflammatory ſymptoms of the diſorder; nor is it to be wondered at, ſince the appetite is frequently unimpaired, and the generation of blood continues to be the ſame, as in perfect health.</p>
            <p>DR. CULLEN recommends the uſe of bleeding in conſumptions in order to leſſen the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ulcers in the lungs, and thereby to diſpoſe them to heal. From the teſtimonies of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief which bleeding affords in external ulcers and tumors accompanied by inflammation, I am diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to expect the ſame benefit from it in inflamed ulcers and tumors in the lungs: Whether, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we adopt Dr Cullen's theory of conſumption, and treat it as a local diſeaſe, or aſſent to the one which I have delivered, ſtill repeated bleedings ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to be equally neceſſary and uſeful.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="120" facs="unknown:026112_0124_0FCFF3825DA41AB0"/>I HAVE ſeen two caſes of inflammatory con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, attended by an hoemorrhage of a quart of blood from the lungs. I agreed at firſt with the friends of theſe patients in expecting a rapid termination of their diſorder in death, but to the joy and ſurpriſe of all connected with them, they both recovered. I aſcribed their recovery wholly to the inflammatory action of their ſyſtems being ſuddenly reduced by a ſpontaneous diſcharge of blood. Theſe facts, I hope, will ſerve to eſtabliſh the uſefulneſs of blood-letting in the inflammatory ſtate of conſumption, with thoſe phyſicians who are yet diſpoſed to truſt more to the fortuitous operations of nature, than to the deciſions of reaſon and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience.</p>
            <p>I HAVE always found this remedy to be more neceſſary in the winter and firſt ſpring months, than at any other ſeaſon. We obtain by means of repeated bleedings, ſuch a mitigation of all the ſymptoms as enables the patient to uſe exerciſe with advantage as ſoon as the weather becomes ſo dry and ſettled, as to admit of his going abroad every day.</p>
            <p>THE relief obtained by bleeding, is ſo certain in this ſpecies of conſumption, that I often uſe it
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:026112_0125_0FCFF38481A63208"/>
as a palliative remedy, where I do not expect it will perform a cure. I was lately made happy in finding, that I am not ſingular in this practice. Dr. Hamilton, of Lynn Regis, uſed it with ſucceſs in a conſumption, which was the effect of a moſt deplorable ſcrophula, without entertaining the leaſt hope of its per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming a cure<note n="*" place="bottom">Obſervations on ſcrophulous affection.</note>. In thoſe caſes where inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory action attends the laſt ſcene of the diſorder, there is often more relief obtained by a little bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than by the uſe of opiates, and it is always a more humane preſcription, in deſperate caſes, than the uſual remedies of vomits and bliſters.</p>
            <p>I ONCE bled a ſea captain, whom I had declared to be within a few hours of his diſſolution, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to relieve him of uncommon pain, and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty in breathing. His pulſe was at the ſame time hard. The evacuation, though it conſiſted of only four ounces of blood, had the wiſhed for effect, and his death, I have reaſon to believe, was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered more eaſy by it. The blood, in this caſe, was covered with a buffy coat.</p>
            <p>THE quantity of blood drawn in every caſe of inflammatory conſumption, ſhould be determined
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:026112_0126_0FCFF385813D8910"/>
by the force of the pulſe, and the habits of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. I have ſeldom taken more than eight, but more frequently only ſix ounces at a time. It is much better to repeat the bleeding once or twice a week, than to uſe it leſs frequently, but in larger quantities.</p>
            <p>FROM many years experience of the efficacy of bleeding in this ſpecies of conſumption, I feel my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf authoriſed to aſſert, that where a greater pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of perſons die of conſumption when it makes it firſt appearance in the lungs, with ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of inflammatory diatheſis, than die of ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary pneumonies, (provided exerciſe be uſed after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards) it muſt in nine caſes out of ten, be aſcribed to the ignorance, or erroneous theories of phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, or to the obſtinacy or timidity of patients.</p>
            <p>IN ſpeaking thus confidently of the neceſſity and benefits of bleeding in the inflammatory ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of conſumption, I confine myſelf to obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made chiefly in the ſtate of Pennſylvania. It is poſſible the inhabitants of European countries and cities, may ſo far have paſſed the ſimple ages of inflammatory diſorders, as never to exhibit thoſe ſymptoms on which I have founded the indication of blood-letting. I am diſpoſed to believe more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over that in moſt of the ſouthern ſtates of America,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:026112_0127_0FCFF38795006F30"/>
the inflammatory action of the arterial ſyſtem is of too tranſient a nature to admit of the repeated bleedings in the conſumption which are uſed with ſo much advantage in the middle and northern ſtates.</p>
            <p>IN reviewing the prejudices againſt this excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent remedy in conſumptions, I have frequently wiſhed to diſcover ſuch a ſubſtitute for it as would with equal ſafety and certainty take down the morbid excitement, and action of the arterial ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem. I believe in the exiſtence of ſuch a remedy; but until it be diſcovered, it becomes us to combat the prejudices againſt bleeding; and to derive all the advantages from it which have been mentioned.</p>
            <p n="2">2. A SECOND remedy for the inflammatory ſpecies of conſumption ſhould be ſought for in a MILK and VEGETABLE DIET. In thoſe caſes where the milk does not lie eaſy on the ſtomach, it ſhould be mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with water, or it ſhould be taken without its cheeſy or oily parts, as in whey, or butter-milk, or it ſhould be taken without ſkimming; for there are caſes in which milk will agree with the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach in this ſtate, and in no other. The oil of the milk probably helps to promote the ſolution of its curds in the ſtomach. It is ſeldom in the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of phyſicians to preſcribe aſſes or goats milk in
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:026112_0128_0FCFF38E301CB238"/>
this diſorder; but a good ſubſtitute may be prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for them by adding to cows milk a little ſugar, and a third or fourth part of water, or of a weak infuſion of green tea. The vegetables which are eaten in this ſtate of the diſorder, ſhould contain as little ſtimulus as poſſible. It would ſeem if the moderate portion of ſacharine matter which is contained in certain fruits ſuch as ſtrawberries, grapes, and ſweet apples were peculiarly agreeable and uſeful, for each of theſe fruits has been ſaid to have cured the conſumption. In thoſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes where the ſtomach is diſpoſed to dyſpepſia, a little animal food, alſo ſoft boiled eggs, may be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken with ſafety, mixed with vegetable aliment. Where there is no morbid affection of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach, I have ſeen the white meats eaten without encreaſing the inflammatory ſymptoms of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe. The tranſition from a full diet to milk and vegetables ſhould be gradual, and the addition of animal to vegetable aliment, ſhould be made with the ſame caution. From the neglect of this direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, much error, both in theory and practice, has ariſen in the treatment of conſumptions.</p>
            <p>IN every caſe it will be better for the patient to eat four or five, rather than only two or three meals in a day. A leſs ſtimulus is by this means communicated to the ſyſtem, and leſs chyle is
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:026112_0129_0FCFF390579BB380"/>
mixed with the blood in a given time. Of ſo much importance do I conceive this direction to be, that I ſeldom preſcribe for a chronic diſeaſe of any kind without enforcing it.</p>
            <p n="3">3. VOMITS have been much commended by Dr. Read in this diſorder. From their indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate uſe in every ſpecies of conſumption, I am ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied they have oftener done harm than good. In caſes where a patient objects to bleeding, or where a phyſician doubts of its propriety, vomits may always be ſubſtituted in its room with great advantage.</p>
            <p n="4">4. NITRE in moderate doſes of ten or fifteen grains taken three or four times a day, has ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times done ſervice in this diſorder; but I believe it has been only when the diſeaſe has appeared with inflammatory ſymptoms. Care ſhould be taken not to perſevere too long in the uſe of this remedy as it is apt to impair the appetite. I have known one caſe in which it produced an obſtinate dyſpep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſia, and a diſpoſition to the colic; but it removed at the ſame time, the ſymptoms of pulmonary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
            <p n="5">5. COLD and dry air, when combined with the exerciſe of <hi>walking,</hi> deſerves to be mentioned as an antiphlogiſtic remedy. I have repeatedly
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:026112_0130_0FCFF3949B80DCF0"/>
preſcribed it in this ſpecies of the conſumption with advantage, and have often had the pleaſure of find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a ſingle walk of two or three miles in a clear cold day, produce nearly the ſame diminution of the force and frequency of the pulſe, as the loſs of ſix or eight ounces of blood.</p>
            <p>I COME now to treat of the palliative remedies which are proper in the</p>
            <p n="2">II. OR HECTIC SPECIES of Conſumption. Here we begin to behold the diſorder in a new and more diſtreſſing form than in the ſpecies which has been deſcribed. There is in this ſpecies of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption the ſame complication of inflammatory and typhus diatheſis which occurs in the typhoid and puerperile fevers, and of courſe the ſame dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty in treating it ſucceſsfully; for the ſame re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies do good and harm, according as the former or latter diatheſis prevails in the ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>ALL that I ſhall ſay upon this ſpecies is, that the treatment of it ſhould be accommodated to the predominance of inflammatory or typhus ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, for the hectic ſpecies preſents each of them alternately every week, and ſometimes every day to the hand or eye of a phyſician. When a hard pulſe with acute pains in the ſide and breaſt occur, bleeding and other remedies for the inflammatory
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:026112_0131_0FCF49511705FF48"/>
ſpecies muſt be uſed; but when the diſeaſe exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits a predominance of typhus ſymptoms, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies for that ſpecies to be mentioned immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, ſhould be preſcribed in moderate doſes. There are ſeveral palliative medicines which have been found uſeful in the hectic ſpecies, but they are ſuch as belong alike to the other two ſpecies; and therefore will be mentioned hereafter in a place aſſigned to them.</p>
            <p>I AM ſorry, however, to add, that where bleed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing has not been indicated, I have ſeldom been able to afford much relief by medicine in this ſpecies of conſumption. I have uſed alternately the moſt gentle, and the moſt powerful vegetable and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallic tonics to no purpoſe. Even arſenic has failed in my hands of affording the leaſt alleviation of the hectic fever. I conceive the removal of this fever, to be the great deſideratum in the cure of conſumption, and ſhould it be found after all our reſearches to exiſt only in exerciſe, it will be no departure from a law of nature; for I believe there are no diſeaſes of equal degrees of chronic debility, in which medicines are of any more effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, than they are in the hectic fever of the pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conſumption.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="128" facs="unknown:026112_0132_0FCFF395DD3BDF18"/>I PROCEED now to ſpeak of the palliative reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies which are proper in the</p>
            <p n="3">III. OR, TYPHUS SPECIES of the Pulmonary Conſumption.</p>
            <p>THE firſt of theſe are STIMULATING MEDICINES. However juſt the complaints of Dr. Fothergill may be againſt the uſe of balſams in the inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and mixed ſpecies of conſumption, I am ſatisfied that they are not only ſafe, but uſeful likewiſe in mitigating the ſymptoms of weak action in the arterial ſyſtem. I have therefore frequently preſcribed the balſam of copaivae, of Peru, the oil of amber, and different preparations of turpentine and tar in moderate doſes with obvious advantage. Garlic, the juice of dandelyon, a ſtrong tea made of horehound, and a decoction of the inner bark of the wild cherry tree;<note n="*" place="bottom">Prunus Virginiana.</note> alſo bitters of all kinds, have all been found ſafe and uſeful tonics in this ſpecies of the conſumption. Even the Peruvian bark itſelf ſo often and ſo generally condemned in conſumptions is always an innocent and frequently an active medicine where there is a total abſence of inflammatory diatheſis in this diſorder. With theſe medicines ſhould be combined</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="129" facs="unknown:026112_0133_0FCFF39814B37BF8"/>2. A CORDIAL and STIMUMATING DIET. Milk and vegetables ſo proper in the inflammatory, are improper when taken alone in this ſpecies of conſumption. I believe they often accelerate that decay of appetite and diarrhoea, which form the cloſing ſcene of the diſorder. I think I have ſeen advantages from the uſe, not only of freſh, but of ſalted animal food when preſcribed in the total ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of inflammatory diatheſis. Oyſters, it has been ſaid, have performed cures of conſumption. If they have, it muſt have been only when they were eaten in that ſpecies of it which is now under conſideration. They are a moſt ſavoury and whole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome article of diet in all diſeaſes attended with ſymptoms of general debility. I have found the ſame advantage from dividing the meals here that I mentioned under a former head. The exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of food in this caſe, ſhould not be left to the calls of appetite, any more than the exhibition of a medicine. Indeed food may be made to ſupply the place of cordial medicines, by keeping up a conſtant and gentle action in the whole ſyſtem. For this reaſon, I have frequently adviſed my patients never to ſuffer their ſtomachs to be empty, even for a ſingle hour. I have ſometimes aimed to keep up the influence of a gentle action in the ſtomach upon the whole ſyſtem, by adviſing them to eat in the night, in order to obviate the increaſe of the
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:026112_0134_0FCFF39D6E07F368"/>
excretion in the lungs and of the cough in the morning, which are brought on in part by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of debility from the long abſtraction of the ſtimulus of aliment during the night.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER ſafe and even uſeful the cordial me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines and diet which have been mentioned may appear, yet I am ſorry to add, that I have never ſeen any other advantages from them than a miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of diſtreſſing ſymptoms, except when they have been combined with ſuitable and long con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued exerciſe. Even under this favourable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, they are often ineffectual; for there frequently occurs in this ſpecies of conſumption, ſuch a deſtruction of the ſubſtance and functions of the lungs, as to preclude the poſſibility of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery by the uſe of any of the remedies which have been diſcovered.</p>
            <p>I HAVE ſaid formerly that the three ſpecies of conſumption do not obſerve any regular courſe in ſucceeding each other. They are not only com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated in ſome inſtances, but they often appear and diſappear half a dozen times in the courſe of the diſeaſe, according to the influence of the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, dreſs, diet, and the paſſions, upon the ſyſtem. The great ſecret, therefore, of treating this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſiſts in accommodating all the remedies that
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:026112_0135_0FCFF3A2256DB9E0"/>
have been mentioned to the predominance of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the three ſpecies, or to the different ſtates of the ſyſtem, as manifeſted chiefly by the pulſe. It is in conſequence of having obſerved the evils which have reſulted from the ignorance or neglect of this practice, that I have ſometimes wiſhed that it were poſſible to aboliſh the ſeducing nomencla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of diſeaſes altogether, in order thereby to o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blige phyſicians to conform exactly to the fluctuating ſtate of the ſyſtem in all their preſcriptions; for it is not more certain, that in all cultivated languages, every idea has its appropriate word, than that eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtate of a diſeaſe has its appropriate doſe of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, the knowledge and application of which, can alone conſtitute rational, or enſure uniformly, ſucceſsful practice.</p>
            <p>I COME now to ſay a few words upon thoſe pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liative remedies which are alike proper in every ſpecies of the Pulmonary Conſumption.</p>
            <p>THE firſt Remedy under this head is a DRY SITUATION. A damp air, whether breathed in a room, or out of doors, is always hurtful in every ſpecies of this diſorder. A kitchen or a bed room below the level of the ground has often produced, and never fails to increaſe a pulmonary conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I have often obſerved a peculiar paleneſs,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:026112_0136_0FCFF3A4AECD5E78"/>
(the firſt ſymptom of general debility) to ſhew itſelf very early in the faces of perſons who work or ſleep in cellar kitchens or ſhops.</p>
            <p n="2">2. COUNTRY AIR. The higher and dryer the ſituation which is choſen for the purpoſe of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the benefit of this remedy, the better. Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions expoſed to the ſea, ſhould be carefully avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for it is a ſingular fact, that while conſumptive perſons are benefited by the ſea air, when they breathe it on the ocean, they are always injured by that portion of it which they breathe on the ſea-ſhore. I ſhall not pauſe to inquire, why a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of land and ſea-air is ſo hurtful in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption, and at the ſame time ſo agreeable to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in health, and ſo medicinal in many other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, but ſhall diſmiſs this head by adding a fact which was communicated to me by Dr. Matthew Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine of South-Carolina, and that is, That thoſe ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations which are in the neighbourhood of Bays or Rivers, where the ſalt and freſh waters mix their ſtreams together, are more unfavourable to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive patients than the ſea-ſhore; and therefore ſhould be more carefully avoided by them in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changing city for country air.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="133" facs="unknown:026112_0137_0FCFF3A591DF6C98"/>3. LOOSE DRESSES, AND A CAREFUL ACCOMMO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DATION OF THEM TO THE CHANGES IN THE WEA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>THER. Many facts might be mentioned to ſhew the influence of compreſſion and of tight ligatures of eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry kind, upon the different parts of the body; alſo of too much, or too little cloathing, in producing, or increaſing diſeaſes of every kind, more eſpecially thoſe which affect the lungs. Tight ſtays, garters, waiſtbands, and collars, ſhould all be laid aſide in the conſumption, and the quality of the cloathing ſhould be ſuited to the weather. A citizen of Maryland informed me, that he had twice had a return of a cough and ſpitting of blood, by wearing his ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer cloaths a week after the weather became cool in the month of September. But it is not ſufficient to vary the weight or quality of dreſs with the ſeaſons. It ſhould be varied with the changes which take place in the temperature of the air every day, even in the ſummer months, in middle latitudes. I know a citizen of Philadelphia, who has laboured under a conſumptive diatheſis near thirty years, who believes that he has leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the frequency and violence of pulmonic com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints during that time, by a careful accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his dreſs to the weather.

               <pb n="134" facs="unknown:026112_0138_0FCFF3A81A5CB7E0"/>A REPETITION of colds, and thereby an increaſe of the diſorder, will be prevented by wearing flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel next to the ſkin in winter, and muffin in the ſummer, either in the form of a ſhirt or a waiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coat: where theſe are objected to, a piece of flan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, or of ſoft ſheepſkin, ſhould be worn next to the breaſt. They not only prevent colds, but fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently remove chronic pains from that part of the body.</p>
            <p n="4">4. ARTIFICIAL EVACUATIONS by means of BLIS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERS and ISSUES. I ſuſpect the uſefulneſs of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies to be chiefly confined to the inflammatory and hectic ſpecies of conſumption. In the typhus ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the ſyſtem is too weak to ſuſtain the diſcharges of either of them. Freſh bliſters ſhould be preferred to ſuch as are perpetual, and the iſſues, to be uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſhould be large. They are ſuppoſed to afford relief by diverting a preternatural ſecretion and excretion of mucus or pus from the lungs, to an artificial emunctory in a leſs vital part of the body.</p>
            <p n="5">5. CERTAIN FUMIGATIONS and VAPORS. An accidental cure of a pulmonary affection by the ſmoke of roſin, in a man who bottled liquors, raiſed for a while the credit of the firſt of thoſe remedies. I have tried it, but without much permanent
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:026112_0139_0FCFF3AFB484FA10"/>
effect. I think I have ſeen the pain in the breaſt relieved by receiving the vapor from a mixture of equal parts of tar, bran, and boiling water into the lungs. The ſulphureous and ſaline air of Stabiae, between Mount Veſuvius and the Mediterranean ſea, and the effluvia of the pine foreſts of Lybia, were ſuppoſed in ancient times to be powerful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies in conſumptive complaints; but it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, the exerciſe uſed in travelling to thoſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, contributed chiefly to the cures which were aſcribed to foreign matters acting upon the lungs.</p>
            <p n="6">6. LOZENGES, SYRUPS, and DEMULCENT TEAS. Theſe are too common and too numerous to be mentioned.</p>
            <p n="7">7. OPIATES. It is a miſtake in practice, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon a partial knowledge of the qualities of opium, to adminiſter it only at night, or to ſuppoſe that its efforts in compoſing a cough, depend upon its inducing ſleep. It ſhould be given in ſmall doſes during the day, as well as in larger ones at night. The doſe ſhould be proportioned to the degrees of action in the arterial ſyſtem. The leſs this action, the more opium may be taken with ſafety and advantage.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="136" facs="unknown:026112_0140_0FCFF3B3C64BD100"/>8. DIFFERENT POSITIONS OF THE BODY have been found to be more or leſs favourable to the abatement of the cough. Theſe poſitions ſhould be carefully ſought for, and the body kept in that which procures the moſt freedom from coughing. I have heard of an inſtance, in which a cough which threatened a return of an hoemorrhage from the lungs, was perfectly compoſed for two weeks, by keeping the patient nearly in one poſture in bed; but I have known more caſes in which relief from coughing was to be obtained only by an erect poſture of the body.</p>
            <p n="9">9. CONSIDERABLE relief will often be obtained from the patient's SLEEPING BETWEEN BLANKETS in winter, and on a MATRASS in ſummer. The former prevent freſh colds from night ſweats; the latter frequently checks them altogether. In caſes, where a ſufficient weight of blankets, to keep up an agreeable warmth, cannot be borne without reſtraining eaſy and full acts of inſpiration,—the patient ſhould ſleep under a light feather bed, or an eider down coverlit. They both afford more warmth than double or treble their weight of blankets.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER comfortable this mode of producing warmth in bed may be it does not protect the
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:026112_0141_0FCFF3B7E03963C0"/>
lungs from the morbid effects of the diſtant points of temperature of a warm parlour in the day time, and a cold bed-chamber at night. To produce an equable temperature of air at all hours, I have frequently adviſed my patients, where going to a warm climate, was not practicable, to paſs their nights as well as days in an open ſtove room, in which nearly the ſame degrees of heat were kept up at all hours. I have found this practice, in ſeveral caſes, a tolerable ſubſtitute for a warm cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate.</p>

<pb n="138" facs="unknown:026112_0142_0FCFF3B91B1ACFF0"/>
relapſed, and died in conſequence of burſting a blood-veſſel in her lungs, by a ſudden fit of laugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
            <p n="11">11. ARE there any advantages to be derived from the excitement of certain PASSIONS in the treatment of conſumptions? Dr. Blane tells us, that many conſumptive perſons were relieved, and that ſome recovered, in conſequence of the terror which was excited by a hurricane in Barbadoes, in the year 1780. It will be difficult to imitate, by artificial means, the accidental cures which are recorded by Dr. Blane; but we learn enough from them to inſpire the invigorating paſſions of hope and confidence in the minds of our patients, and to recommend to them ſuch exerciſes as pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce exertions of body and mind analogous to thoſe which are produced by terror. Van Swieten and Smollet relate cures of conſumptions, by pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients falling into ſtreams of cold water. Perhaps in both inſtances, the cures were performed only by the fright and conſequent exertion produced by the fall. This is only one inſtance out of many which might be mentioned, of partial and unequal action being ſuddenly changed into general and equal excitement in every part of the ſyſtem. The cures of conſumptions which have been performed
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:026112_0143_0FCFF3BAA50F7128"/>
by a camp life<note n="*" place="bottom">Medical Inquiries and Obſervations.</note>, have probably been much aſſiſted by the commotions in the paſſions which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited by the various and changing events of war.</p>
            <p>BEFORE I proceed to ſpeak of the radical cure of the conſumption, it will be neceſſary to obſerve, that by means of the palliative remedies which have been mentioned, many perſons have been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and ſome have had their lives prolonged by them for many years. In all theſe caſes I have found, upon inquiry, that the diſorder was attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with but little general debility, and that it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently recurred as ſoon as the patient left off the uſe of his remedies, unleſs it were prevented by ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary or voluntary exerciſe.</p>
            <p>IT is truly ſurpriſing to obſerve how long ſome perſons have lived, who have been affected by a conſumptive diatheſis, and by frequent attacks of many of the moſt troubleſome ſymptoms of this diſorder. Van Swieten mentions the caſe of a man, who had lived thirty years in this ſtate. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton relates the hiſtory of a man, in whom the ſymptoms of conſumption appeared with but little variation or abatement from his early youth till the 70th year of his age; and Bennet ſays, he
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:026112_0144_0FCFF3BCB3E9F290"/>
knew an inſtance of this diſorder which continued ſixty years. I preſcribed for one of my pupils four and twenty years ago, in a conſumption, who, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the greateſt part of the time that has clapſed ſince, has ſeldom paſſed a year without ſpitting blood, nor a week without coughing, who now en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys a tolerable ſhare of health. In this caſe, the fatal tendency of the diſorder was conſtantly op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by rural exerciſes, by a cordial, but tempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate diet, and (during the abſence of inflammatory action in his pulſe) by the occaſional uſe of Peru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vian bark.</p>
            <p>I AM led here to mention another inſtance of the analogy between pneumony and the pulmonary conſumption. We often ſee the ſame frequency of recurrence of both diſorders in habits which are prediſpoſed to them. I have attended a Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man citizen of Philadelphia, in ſeveral fits of the pneumony, who has been confined to his bed eight and twenty times, by the ſame diſorder, in the courſe of the ſame number of years. He has, for the moſt part, enjoyed good health in the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals of thoſe attacks, and always appeared, till lately, to poſſeſs a good conſtitution. In the caſes of the frequent recurrence of pneumony, no one has ſuſpected the diſeaſe to have originated in a morbid ſtate of the lungs; on the contrary, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:026112_0145_0FCFF3BFE113D988"/>
evidently to be produced by the <hi>ſudden</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the ſame cauſes, which by acting with leſs force, and for a <hi>longer</hi> time, produce the pulmona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry conſumption. The name of pneumony is taken from the principal ſymptom of this diſorder, but it is as certainly a diſeaſe of the whole arterial ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem as the conſumption; and I add further, that it is as certainly produced by general prediſpoſing debility. The hardneſs and fulneſs of the pulſe do not militate againſt this aſſertion, for they are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together the effects of a morbid and convulſive ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement of the ſanguiferous ſyſtem. The ſtrength manifeſted by the pulſe is moreover partial, for every other part of the body diſcovers, at the ſame time, ſigns of extreme debility.</p>
            <p>IT would be eaſy, by purſuing this ſubject a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle further, to mention a number of facts which, by the aid of principles in phyſiology and pathology, which are univerſally admitted, would open to us a new theory of fevers, but this would lead us too far from the ſubject before us. I ſhall only re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark, that all that has been ſaid of the influence of <hi>general</hi> debilitating cauſes upon the lungs, both in pnuemony and conſumption, and of the alternation of the conſumption with other general diſeaſes, will receive great ſupport from conſidering the lungs only as a part of the whole external ſurface of the
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:026112_0146_0FCFF3C157B6C918"/>
body, upon which moſt of the remote and exciting cauſes of both diſeaſes produce their firſt effects. This extent of the ſurface of the body, not only to the lungs, but to the alimentary canal, was firſt taken notice of by Dr. Boerhaave; but was unhappily neglected by him in his theories of the diſeaſes of the lungs and bowels. Dr. Keil ſuppoſes, that the lungs, from the peculiar ſtructure of the bronchial veſſels, and air veſicles, expoſe a ſurface to the action of the air, equal to the extent of the whole external and viſible ſurface of the body.</p>
            <p>THUS have I mentioned the uſual palliative re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies for the conſumption. Many of theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies have, under certain circumſtances, been ſaid to have cured the diſeaſe, but I ſuſpect that ſuch cures have taken place only when the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der has partaken of an intermediate nature be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a pnuemony and a true pulmonary conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Such connecting ſhades appear between the extreme points of many other diſeaſes. In a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer eſſay,<note n="*" place="bottom">Inquiry into the diſeaſes and remedies of the Indians of North America; and a comparative view of their diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and remedies with thoſe of civilized nations. P. 43.</note> I endeavoured to account for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mutation (if I may be allowed the expreſſion) of the pneumony into the conſumption, by aſcribing
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:026112_0147_0FCFF3C2E53694B0"/>
it to the increaſe of the debilitating refinements of civilized life. This opinion has derived conſtant ſupport from every obſervation I have made con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with this ſubject, ſince its firſt publication, in the year 1772.</p>
            <p>I COME now to treat of the RADICAL REMEDIES for the pulmonary conſumption.</p>
            <p>In an eſſay formerly alluded to<note n="*" place="bottom">Thoughts upon the pulmonary conſumption. Med. Inq. and Obſervations.</note>, I mentioned the effects of labour, and the hardſhips of a camp or naval life, upon this diſorder. As there muſt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occur ſuch objections to each of thoſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, as to forbid their being recommended or adopted, it will be neceſſary to ſeek for ſubſtitutes for them in the different ſpecies of exerciſe. Theſe are, <hi>active, paſſive,</hi> and <hi>mixed.</hi> The <hi>active,</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes walking, and the exerciſe of the hands and feet in working or dancing. The <hi>paſſive</hi> includes rocking in a cradle, ſwinging, ſailing, and riding in carriages of different kinds. The <hi>mixed</hi> is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined chiefly to riding on horſe-back.</p>
            <p>I HAVE mentioned all the different ſpecies of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, not becauſe I think they all belong to the
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:026112_0148_0FCFF3C44D8263A8"/>
claſs of radical remedies for the conſumption, but becauſe it is often neceſſary to uſe thoſe which are paſſive, before we recommend thoſe of a mixed or active nature. That phyſician does not err more who adviſes a patient to take phyſic, without ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying its qualities and doſes, than the phyſician does who adviſes a patient, in a conſumption, to uſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe, without ſpecifying its ſpecies and degrees. From the neglect of this direction, we often find conſumptive patients injured inſtead of being reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by exerciſes, which, if uſed with judgment, might have been attended with the happieſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
            <p>I HAVE before ſuggeſted that the ſtimulus of every medicine, which is intended to excite action in the ſyſtem, ſhould always be in an exact ratio to its excitability. The ſame rule ſhould be applied to the ſtimulus of exerciſe. I have heard a well atteſted caſe of a young lady, upon whoſe conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the firſt ſalutary impreſſion was made by rocking her in a cradle; and I know another caſe in which a young lady, in the loweſt ſtate of that debility which precedes an affection of the lungs, was prepared for the uſe of the mixed and active exerciſes, by being firſt moved gently back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forwards in a chariot without horſes, for an hour every day. Swinging appears to act
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:026112_0149_0FCF4953D9D3E870"/>
in the ſame gentle manner. In the caſe of a gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diner, who was far advanced in a conſumption, in the Pennſylvania hoſpital, I had the pleaſure of obſerving its good effects, in an eminent degree. It ſo far reſtored him, as to enable him to complete his recovery by working at his former occupa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>IN caſes of extreme debility, the following or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould be recommended in the uſe of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſpecies of exerciſe.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Rocking in a cradle, or riding on an elaſtic board—commonly called a chamber horſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Swinging.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Sailing.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Riding in a carriage.</p>
            <p n="5">5. Riding on horſeback.</p>
            <p n="6">6. Walking.</p>
            <p n="7">7. Running—Dancing, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>IN the uſe of each of thoſe ſpecies of exerciſe great attention ſhould be paid to the <hi>degree</hi> or <hi>force</hi> of action with which they are applied to the body.
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:026112_0150_0FCFF3C9974D7058"/>
For example,—in riding in a carriage, the exerciſe will be leſs in a four-wheel carriage than in a ſingle horſe chair, and leſs when the horſes move in a walking, than a trotting gait. In riding on horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back, the exerciſe will be leſs or greater according as the horſe walks, paces, canters, or trots, in paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing over the ground.</p>
            <p>I HAVE good reaſon to believe, that an Engliſh ſea captain, who was on the verge of the grave with the conſumption, in the ſpring of the year 1790, owed his perfect recovery to nothing but the above gradual manner, in which, by my advice, he made uſe of the exerciſes of riding in a carriage and on horſeback. I have ſeen many other caſes of the good effects of thus accommodating exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe to debility; and I am ſorry to add, that I have ſeen many caſes in which from the neglect of this manner of uſing exerciſe, moſt of the ſpecies and degrees of it, have either been uſeleſs, or done harm. However careleſsly this obſervation may be read by phyſicians, or attended to by patients, I conceive to direction to be more neceſſary in the cure of conſumptions. I have been thus particular in detailing it, not only becauſe I believe it to be important, but that I might atone to ſociety for that portion of evil which I might have prevented
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:026112_0151_0FCFF3CC308FF220"/>
by a more ſtrict attention to it in the firſt years of my practice.</p>
            <p>THE more the arms are uſed in exerciſe the better. One of the proprietary governors of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, who laboured for many years under a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive diatheſis, derived great benefit from fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently rowing himſelf in a ſmall boat, a few miles up and down the river Schuilkill. Two young men, who were prediſpoſed to a conſumption, were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly cured by working ſteadily at a printing preſs in this city. Perhaps the ſuperior advantages of riding on horſeback, in this diſorder, may ariſe in part from the conſtant and gentle uſe of the arms in the management of the bridle and the whip.</p>
            <p>MUCH has been ſaid in favour of ſea voyages in conſumptions. In the mild degrees of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order they certainly have done ſervice,—but I ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the relief given, or the cures performed by them, ſhould be confined chiefly to ſeafaring people, who add to the benefits of a conſtant change of pure air, a ſhare of the invigorating exerciſes of navigating the ſhip. I have frequently heard of conſumptive patients reviving at ſea, probably from the tranſient effects of ſea ſickneſs upon the whole ſyſtem, and growing worſe as ſoon as they
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:026112_0152_0FCFF3CF8D5289A8"/>
came near the end of their voyage. It would ſeem as if the mixture of land and ſea airs was hurtful to the lungs in every ſituation and condition in which it could be applied to them. Nor is this peculiar and morbid operation of land and ſea airs upon the human body confined only to conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive people. I croſſed the Atlantic ocean in the year 1766, with a ſea captain, who announced to his paſſengers the agreeable news that we were near the Britiſh coaſt before any diſcovery had been made of our ſituation by ſounding, or by a change in the colour of the water. Upon aſking him upon what he founded his opinion,—he ſaid, that he had been ſneezing, which he added, was the ſign of an approaching cold, and that in the courſe of upwards of twenty years, he had never made the land (to uſe the ſeaman's phraſe) with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being affected in a ſimilar manner. I have viſited many ſick people in Philadelphia ſoon after their arrival from ſea, who have informed me, that they had enjoyed good health during the greateſt part of their voyage, and that they had contracted their indiſpoſitions after they came within ſight of the land. I mention theſe facts only to ſhew the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of adviſing conſumptive patients, who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take a ſea voyage for the recovery of their health, not to expoſe themſelves upon deck in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and at night, after they arrive within the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:026112_0153_0FCFF3D86D6C8270"/>
in which the mixture of the land and ſea airs may be ſuppoſed to take place.</p>
            <p>I SUBSCRIBE, from what I have obſerved, to the bold declaration of Dr. Sydenham, in favor of the efficacy of <hi>riding on horſeback,</hi> in the cure of conſumption. I do not think the exiſtence of ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, or even tubercles in the lungs, when recent, or of a moderate ſize, the leaſt objection to the uſe of this excellent remedy. Ulcers in the lungs are not neceſſarily fatal, and tubercles have no ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity in them which ſhould render their removal impracticable by this ſpecies of exerciſe. The firſt queſtion, therefore, to be aſked by a phyſician who viſits a patient in this diſorder ſhould be, not, what is the ſtate of his lungs, but, is he able to ride on horſeback.</p>
            <p>THERE are two methods of riding for health in this diſorder. The firſt is by ſhort excurſions; the ſecond is, by long journies. In ſlight con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptive affections, and after a recovery from an acute illneſs, ſhort excurſions are ſufficient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move the exiſting debility; but in the more advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced ſtages of conſumption, they are ſeldom effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual, and frequently do harm by exciting an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional appetite without adding to the digeſtive powers. They moreover keep the ſyſtem con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:026112_0154_0FCFF3DB84607FA8"/>
vibrating by their unavoidable inconſtancy, between diſtant points of tone and debility<note n="*" place="bottom">The bad effects of <hi>inconſtant</hi> exerciſe have been taken notice of in the goat. Dr. Sydenham ſays, when it is uſed only by fits and ſtarts in this diſorder, it does harm.</note>, and they are unhappily accompanied at all times from the want of a ſucceſſion of freſh objects to divert the mind, by the melancholy reflection that they are the ſad, but neceſſary conditions of life.</p>
            <p>IN a conſumption of long continuance or of great danger, long journies on horſe back are the the moſt effectual modes of exerciſe. They afford a conſtant ſucceſſion of freſh objects and company, which divert the mind from dwelling upon the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of the exiſting malady; they are moreover at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by a conſtant change of air, and they are not liable to be interrupted by company, or tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent changes in the weather, by which means ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite and digeſtion, action and power all keep pace with each other. It is to be lamented that the uſe of this excellent remedy is frequently op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by indolence and narrow circumſtances in both ſexes, and by the peculiarity of ſituation and temper in the female ſex. Women are attached to their families by ſtronger ties than men. They cannot travel alone. Their delicacy, which is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:026112_0155_0FCFF3DC5276E9D8"/>
by ſickneſs, is liable to be offended at every ſtage,—and laſtly, they ſooner relax in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions to prolong their lives than men. Of the truth of the laſt obſervation, Sir William Hamil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton has furniſhed us with a ſtriking illuſtration. He tells us, that in digging into the rums pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the late earthquake in Calabria, the wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who periſhed in it, were all found with their arms folded as if they had abandoned themſelves immediately to deſpair and death; whereas, the men were found with their arms extended, as if they had reſiſted their fate to the laſt moment of their lives. It would ſeem from this fact, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others of a ſimilar nature which might be rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted; that a capacity of bearing pain and diſtreſs with fortitude and reſignation, was the diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing characteriſtic of the female mind; while a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to reſiſt and overcome evil belonged in a more peculiar manner to the mind of man. I have mentioned this peculiarity of circumſtances and temper in female patients, only ſo the ſake of convincing phyſicians that it will be neceſſary for them to add all the force of eloquence to their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, when they recommend journies to women in preference to all other remedies, for the recovery of their health.</p>

               <pb n="152" facs="unknown:026112_0156_0FCF495768C3F190"/>PERSONS, moreover, who purſue active employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, frequently object to undertaking journies, from an opinion that their daily occupations are ſufficient to produce all the ſalutary effects we expect from artificial exerciſe. It will be highly neceſſary to correct this miſtake, by aſſuring ſuch perſons that, however uſeful the habitual exerciſe of an active, or even a laborious employment may be to <hi>preſerve</hi> health, it muſt always be exchanged for one which excites new impreſſions, both upon the mind and body in every attempt to <hi>reſtore</hi> the ſyſtem from that debility which is connected with pulmonary conſumption.</p>
            <p>AS travelling is often rendered uſeleſs, and even hurtful in this diſeaſe from being purſued in an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper manner, it will be neceſſary to furniſh our patients with ſuch directions as will enable them to derive the greateſt benefit from their journies. I ſhall therefore, in this place, mention the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the directions which I have given in wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting for many years to ſuch conſumptive patients as undertake journies by my advice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. TO <hi>Avoid Fatigue.</hi> Too much cannot be ſaid to enforce this direction. It is the hinge on which the recovery or death of a conſumptive pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient frequently turns. I repeat it again, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:026112_0157_0FCF49A2D98FABB0"/>
that patients ſhould be charged over and over when they ſet off on a journey, as well as when they uſe exerciſe of any kind to avoid fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue. For this purpoſe, they ſhould begin by travelling only a few miles in a day, and increaſe the diſtance of their ſtages as they increaſe their ſtrength. By neglecting this practice, many per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have returned from journies much worſe than when they left home, and many have died in ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verns, or at the houſes of their friends on the road. Travelling in ſtage-coaches is ſeldom ſafe for a conſumptive patient. They are often crouded; they give too much motion; and they afford by their ſhort delays and diſtant ſtages, too little time for reſt, or for taking the frequent refreſhment which was formerly recommended.</p>
            <p n="2">2. TO <hi>Avoid travelling too ſoon in the Morning,</hi> and after the <hi>Going down of the Sun in the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi>; and if the weather be hot, never to travel in the middle of the day. The ſooner a patient breakfaſts after he leaves his bed the better; and in no caſe ſhould he leave his morning ſtage with an empty ſtomach.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IF it ſhould be neceſſary for a patient to lie down, or to ſleep in the day time, he ſhould be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> to <hi>undreſs</hi> himſelf, and to cover his body
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:026112_0158_0FCFF3DED24D6108"/>
between ſheets or blankets. The uſual ligatures of garters, ſtocks, kneebands, waiſtcoats and ſhoes, are very unfriendly to ſound ſleep; hence perſons who lie down with their cloaths on, often awake from an afternoon's nap in terror from dreams, or in a profuſe ſweat, or with a head-ach or ſick ſtomach; and generally out of humor. The ſurveyors are ſo ſenſible of the truth of this remark, that they always undreſs themſelves when they ſleep in the woods. An intelligent gentleman of this profeſſion informed me that he had fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſeen young woodſmen who had refuſed to conform to this practice, ſo much indiſpoſed in the morning, that after the experience of a few nights, they were forced to adopt it.</p>
            <p>GREAT care ſhould be taken in ſleeping, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the day time, or at night, never to lie down in damp ſheets. Dr. Sydenham excepts the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger from this quarter, when he ſpeaks of the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of riding on horſeback in curing the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption.</p>
            <p n="4">4. PATIENTS who travel for health in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order ſhould avoid all <hi>large companies,</hi> more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally <hi>evening</hi> and <hi>night parties.</hi> The air of a contaminated room, phlogiſticated by the breath of fifteen or twenty perſons, and by the ſame number
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:026112_0159_0FCFF3E0ACBF5A50"/>
of burning candles, is poiſon to a conſumptive pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient. To avoid impure air from every other ſource, he ſhould likewiſe avoid ſleeping in a croud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed room, or with curtains around his bed, and even with a bed-fellow.</p>
            <p n="5">5. TRAVELLING, to be effectual in this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, ſhould be conducted in ſuch a manner as that a patient may eſcape the <hi>extremes</hi> of <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>cold.</hi> For this purpoſe he ſhould paſs the winter, and part of the ſpring in Georgia or South-Carolina, and the ſummer in New Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Maſſachuſetts, or Vermont, or if he pleaſes, he may ſtill more effectually ſhun the ſummer heats by croſſing the lakes, and travelling along the ſhores of the St. Lawrence to the city of Quebec. He will thus eſcape the extremes of heat and cold, particularly the leſs avoidable one of heat; for I have conſtantly found the hot month of July to be as unfriendly to conſumptive patients in Pennſylvania, as the variable month of March. By theſe means too he will enjoy nearly an equable temperature of air in every month of the year; and his ſyſtem will be free from the inconvenience of the alternate ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of heat and cold upon it. The autumnal months ſhould be ſpent in New-Jerſey or Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="156" facs="unknown:026112_0160_0FCFF3E284685F48"/>IN theſe journies from north to ſouth, or from ſouth to north, he ſhould be careful, for reaſons before mentioned, to keep at as great a diſtance as poſſible from the ſea coaſt. Should this inquiry fall into the hands of a Britiſh phyſician, I would beg leave to ſuggeſt to him, whether more advantages would not acrue to his conſumptive patients from adviſing them to croſs the Atlantic ocean, and afterwards to purſue the tour which I have recommended, than by ſending them to Portugal, France, or Italy—Here they will arrive with ſuch a mitigation of the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence of the diſorder, in conſequence of the length of their ſea voyage, as will enable them immediately to begin their journies on horſeback. Here they will be expoſed to fewer temptations to intemperance, or to unhealthy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſements, than in old European countries. And, laſtly, in the whole courſe of this tour, they will travel among a people related to them by a ſame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of language and manners, and by ancient or modern ties of citizenſhip. Long journies for the recovery of health under circumſtances ſo agreeable, ſhould certainly be preferred to travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling among ſtrangers of different nations, langua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, and manners on the continent of Europe.</p>
            <p n="6">6. TO render travelling on horſeback effectual in a conſumption, it ſhould be continued with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:026112_0161_0FCFF3E3CFD5FC50"/>
intervals from <hi>ſix to twelve months.</hi> But the cure ſhould not be reſted upon a ſingle journey. It ſhould be repeated every <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three years,</hi> till our patient has paſſed the conſumptive ſtages of life. Nay,—he muſt do more, he muſt acquire a <hi>habit</hi> of riding conſtantly, both at home and abroad, or to uſe the words of Dr. Fuller "he muſt, like a Tartar, learn to live on horſeback, by which means he will acquire in time the conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a Tartar<note n="*" place="bottom">Medicina Gymnaſtica, p. 116.</note>."</p>
            <p>WHERE benefit is expected from a change of climate, as well as from travelling, patients ſhould reſide at leaſt two years in the place which is choſen for that purpoſe. I have ſeldom known a reſidence for a ſhorter time in a foreign climate do much ſervice.</p>
            <p>TO ſecure a perfect obedience to medical advice, it would be extremely uſeful if conſumptive pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients could always be acompanied by a phyſician. Celſus ſays, he found it more eaſy to cure the dropſy in ſlaves than in freemen, becauſe they more readily ſubmitted to the reſtraints he im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon their appetites. Madneſs has become a curable diſorder in England, ſince the phyſicians of that country have opened private mad-houſes,
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:026112_0162_0FCFF3E55D454558"/>
and have taken the entire and conſtant direction of their patients into their own hands. The ſame ſucceſsful practice would probably follow the treatment of conſumptions, if patients were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly kept under the eye and authority of their phyſicians.—The keenneſs of appetite, and great ſtock of animal ſpirits, which thoſe perſons frequently poſſeſs, hurry them into many exceſſes which defeat the beſt concerted plans of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery;—or, if they eſcape theſe irregularities, they are frequently ſeduced from our direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by every quack remedy which is recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to them. Unfortunately the cough be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a ſignal of their diſorder, at every ſtage of their journey, and the eaſy or pleaſant preſcriptions of even hoſtlers and ferrymen, are often ſubſtituted to the ſelf-denial and exertion which have been im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by phyſicians. The love of life in theſe caſes ſeems to level all capacities; for I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved perſons of the moſt cultivated underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings to yield in common with the vulgar to the uſe of theſe preſcriptions.</p>
            <p>I CANNOT conclude this inquiry without ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, that the author of it derived from his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal anceſtors a prediſpoſition to the pulmonary conſumption, and that between the 18th and 43d years of his age, he has occaſionally been afflicted
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:026112_0163_0FCFF3E7E90776B8"/>
with many of the ſymptoms of that diſorder which he has deſcribed:—By the conſtant and faithful uſe of moſt of the remedies which he has recommended, he has enjoyed for ſeveral years nearly an uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted exemption from pulmonary complaints. In humble gratitude, therefore, to that BEING, who condeſcends to be called the preſerver of men, he thus publicly devotes the reſult of his experience and inquiries to the benefit of ſuch of his fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures as may be afflicted with the ſame diſorder, ſincerely wiſhing that they may be as uſeful to them, as they have been to the author.</p>

            <head>OBSERVATIONS, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>WHETHER we admit the exhaling and abſorbing veſſels to be affected in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral dropſies by preternatural debility—palſy—or rupture, or by a retrograde motion of their fluids, it is certain that their exhaling and abſorbing pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er is materially affected by too much, or too little action in the arterial ſyſtem. That too little action in the arteries ſhould favour dropſical effuſions, has been long obſerved, but it has been leſs obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous that the ſame effuſions are ſometimes promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and their abſorption prevented, by too much action in theſe veſſels. That this fact ſhould have eſcaped our notice, is the more remarkable, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering how long we have been accuſtomed to ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſerous ſwellings in the joints in the acute
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:026112_0166_0FCFF3EC2E1272E8"/>
rheumatiſm, and copious, but partial effuſions of water in the form of ſweat, in every ſpecies of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory fever.</p>
            <p>IT is nothing new that the healthy action of one part, ſhould depend upon the healthy action of another part of the ſyſtem. We ſee it in many of the diſeaſes of the nerves and brain. The tetanus is cured by exciting a tone in the arterial ſyſtem; madneſs is cured by leſſening the action of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries by copious bloodletting, and epilepſy and hyſteria are often mitigated by the moderate uſe of the ſame remedy.</p>
            <p>BY too much action in the arterial ſyſtem, I mean a certain morbid excitement in the arteries, accompanied by preternatural force, which is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the ſenſe of touch. It differs from the morbid excitement of the arteries, which takes place in inflammatory fevers, in being of a leſs ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular or convulſive nature, and in being attended by leſs febrile heat, and with little or no pain in the head or limbs. The thirſt is nearly the ſame in this ſpecies of dropſy, as in inflammatory fevers. I include here thoſe dropſies only in which the whole ſyſtem is affected by what is called an hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dropic diatheſis.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="165" facs="unknown:026112_0167_0FCFF3EDAD2B2028"/>THAT debility ſhould, under certain circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, diſpoſe to exceſſive action, and that exceſſive action ſhould occur in one part of the body, at the ſame time that debility prevailed in every other, are abundantly evident from the hiſtory and phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena of many diſeaſes. Inflammatory fever, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive haemorrhages, tonic gout, aſthma, apoplexy, and palſy, however much they are accompanied by exceſſive action in the arterial ſyſtem, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways preceded by original debility, and are always accompanied by obvious debility in every other part of the ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>BUT it has been leſs obſerved by phyſicians that an undue force or exceſs of action occurs in the arterial ſyſtem in certain dropſies, and that the ſame theory which explains the union of prediſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and nearly general debility, with a partial ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement and preternatural action in the arterial ſyſtem, in the diſeaſes before mentioned, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain the ſymptoms and cure of certain dropſies.</p>
            <p>THAT debility prediſpoſes to every ſpecies of dropſy, is evident from the hiſtory of all the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and occaſional cauſes which produce them. It will be unneceſſary to mention theſe cauſes, as they are to be found in all our ſyſtems of phyſic. Nor will it be neceſſary to mention any proofs of the exiſtence of debility in nearly every part of the
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:026112_0168_0FCFF3EF719C9F60"/>
body. It is too plain to be denied. I ſhall only mention the ſymptoms which indicate a morbid ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citement and preternatural action in the arterial ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem. Theſe are</p>
            <p n="1">1. A <hi>hard, full,</hi> and quick pulſe. This ſymptom I believe, is more common in dropſies than is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuppoſed, for many phyſicians viſit and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>examine patients in theſe diſorders, without feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pulſe. Dr. Home mentions the <hi>frequency</hi> of the pulſe, in the patients whoſe cures he has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded,<note n="*" place="bottom">Medical Facts.</note> but he takes no notice of its force except in two caſes. Dr. Zimmerman, in his account of the dropſy which terminated the life of the late king of Pruſſia, tells us that he found his pulſe <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>full.</hi> I have repeatedly found it full and hard in every ſpecies of dropſy, and more eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially in the firſt ſtage of the diſorder. Indeed I have ſeldom found it otherwiſe in the beginning of the dropſy of the breaſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. SIZY BLOOD. This has been taken notice of by many practical writers, and has very juſtly been aſcribed under certain circumſtances of bloodlet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, to an exceſſive action of the veſſels upon the blood.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="167" facs="unknown:026112_0169_0FCFF3F0A101E7C8"/>3. ALTERNATION <hi>of dropſies with certain diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which were evidently accompanied by exceſs of action in the arterial ſyſtem.</hi> I have ſeen anaſarca alternate with vertigo, and both aſcites and ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarca alternate with tonic madneſs. A caſe of nearly the ſame kind is related by Dr. Mead.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE <hi>occaſional connection of certain dropſies with diſeaſes evidently of an inflammatory nature,</hi> particularly pneumony, rheumatiſm, and gout.</p>
            <p n="5">5. SPONTANEOUS <hi>haemorrhages,</hi> from the lungs, haemorrhoidal veſſels, and noſe, caſes of which ſhall be mentioned hereafter, when we come to treat of the cure of dropſies.</p>
            <p n="6">6. THE <hi>appearance of dropſies in the winter and ſpring, in habits previouſly affected by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termitting fever.</hi> The debility produced by this ſpecies of fever, frequently diſpoſes to inflammatory diatheſis, as ſoon as the body is expoſed to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternate action of heat and cold, nor is this inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory diatheſis always laid aſide, by the tranſition of the intermitting fever into a dropſy, in the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding cold weather.</p>
            <p n="7">7. THE <hi>injurious effects of ſtimulating medicines in certain dropſies,</hi> prove that there exiſts in them,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:026112_0170_0FCFF3F399E9AAC0"/>
at times, too much action in the blood veſſels. Dr. Tiſſot, in a letter to Dr. Haller, <q>De Vario<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lis, apoplexia, et hydrope,</q> condemns in ſtrong terms, the uſe of opium in the dropſy. Now the bad effects of this medicine in dropſies, muſt have ariſen from its having been given in caſes of too much action in the arterial ſyſtem; for opium, we know, increaſes, by its ſtimulating qualities, the action and tone of the blood veſſels, and hence we find, it has been preſcribed with ſucceſs in drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of too little action in the ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>BUT the exiſtence of too much action in the arterial ſyſtem in certain dropſies, will appear more fully from the hiſtory of the effects of the remedies which have been employed either by deſign or ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident in the cure of theſe diſorders. I ſhall firſt mention the remedies which have been uſed with ſucceſs in tonic dropſies; and afterwards mention thoſe which have been given with ſucceſs in drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies of a contrary ſtate of the ſyſtem. I have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly purpoſed to treat only of the theory and cure of dropſies in general, without ſpecifying any of the numerous names it derives from the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parts of the body in which they may be ſeated; but in ſpeaking of the remedies which have been uſed with advantage in both the tonic and atonic ſpecies, I ſhall occaſionally mention the name
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:026112_0171_0FCFF3F76D161188"/>
or ſeat of the dropſy in which the remedy has done ſervice.</p>
            <p>THE Iſt. Remedy that I ſhall mention for drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies is <hi>Blood Letting.</hi> Dr. Hoffman and Dr. Home both cured dropſies accompanied by pulmonic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion by means of this remedy. Dr. Monroe quotes a caſe of dropſy from Sponius, in which bleeding ſuceeeded, but not till after it had been uſed twenty times<note n="*" place="bottom">Treatiſe on the Dropſy.</note>. Mr. Cruikſhank relates a caſe<note n="†" place="bottom">Treatiſe on the Lymphatics.</note> of accidental bleeding, which confirms the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of blood-letting in theſe diſorders. He tells us that he attended a patient with dropſical ſwellings in his legs, who had had a hoarſeneſs for two years. One morning in ſtooping to buckle his ſhoes, he burſted a blood-veſſel in his lungs, from which he loſt a quart of blood; in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which, both the ſwellings and the hoarſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs went off gradually, and he continued well two years afterwards. I have known one caſe in which ſpontaneous haemorrhages from the haemorrhoidal veſſels, and from the noſe, ſuddenly reduced uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal dropſical ſwellings. In this patient there had been an uncommon tenſion and fullneſs in the pulſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="170" facs="unknown:026112_0172_0FCFF3F8D36C84D8"/>TO theſe facts, I can with pleaſure add, that I have cured one perſon of aſcites, and three of anaſarca, (in the courſe of the three laſt years) by means of blood-letting. It has been uſed with equal ſucceſs by Dr. Rawlings, of Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, in a caſe of anaſarca which had reſiſted nitre, and other powerful medicines commonly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed for that diſorder.</p>
            <p>IN thoſe deplorable caſes of Hydrothorax, which do not admit of a radical cure, I have given temporary relief, and thereby protracted life by taking away occaſionally a few ounces of blood.— Had Dr. Zimmerman uſed this remedy in the caſe of the king of Pruſſia, I cannot help thinking from the account which the Doctor gives us of the diet, and pulſe of his royal patient, that he would have leſſened his ſufferings much more than by plentiful doſes of dandelyon; for I take it for granted, from the candor and integrity which the Doctor diſcovered in all his viſits to the king, that he did not expect that dandelyon, or any other medicine would cure him.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH a <hi>full</hi> and <hi>tenſe</hi> pulſe is always an indication of the neceſſity of bleeding; yet I can eaſily conceive there may be ſuch congeſtions, and ſuch a degree of ſtimulus to the arterial ſyſtem,
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:026112_0173_0FCFF3FC06DD7628"/>
as to produce indirect debility, and a <hi>low</hi> or <hi>weak</hi> pulſe. Two caſes of this kind are related by Dr. Monroe, one of which was cured by bleeding. The ſame ſymptom of a low and weak pulſe is often met with in the <hi>firſt</hi> ſtage of pneumony, and apoplexy, and is only to be removed by the plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful uſe of the ſame remedy.</p>
            <p n="2">II. VOMITS have often been given with advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage in dropſies. Dr. Home ſays, that ſquills were uſeful in theſe diſorders only when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced a vomiting. The ultimate action of vomits is certainly debilitating; but in producing a dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution of excitement and action in the arterial ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem, they diſpoſe the lymphatics to abſorb and diſcharge large quantities of water.—The ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficacy of vomits in promoting the abſorption of ſtagnating fluids is not confined to dropſies. Mr. Hunter was once called to viſit a patient in whom he found a bubo in ſuch a ſtate that he purpoſed to open it the next day. In the mean while, the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient went on board of a veſſel where he was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely affected by ſea-ſickneſs and vomiting; in conſequence of which the bubo diſappeared, and the patient recovered without the uſe of the knife.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="172" facs="unknown:026112_0174_0FCFF3FD8AE590E8"/>MR. CRUIKSHANK further mentions a caſe<note n="*" place="bottom">Letter to Mr. Clare, p. 16<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>
               </note> of a ſwelling in the knee being nearly cured by a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient vomiting eight and forty hours in conſequence of his taking a large doſe of the ſalt of tartar in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſoluble tartar.</p>
            <p n="3">III. PURGES. The efficacy of this remedy in the cure of dropſies, has been acknowledged by phyſicians in all ages and countries. Jalap, calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, ſcammony and gamboge, are often preferred for this purpoſe; but I have heard of two caſes of aſcites being cured by a table ſpoonful of ſweet oil taken every day. It probably acted only as a gentle laxative. The cream of tartar ſo highly commended by Dr. Home, ſeems to act <hi>chiefly</hi> in the ſame way. Gherlius, from whom Dr. Home learned the uſe of this medicine, ſays, that all the perſons whom he cured by it were in the vigor of life, and that their diſeaſes had been only of a few months continuance. From theſe two circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, it is moſt probable they were dropſies of exceſſive action in the arterial ſyſtem. He adds further that the perſons who were cured by this medicine, were reduced very low by the uſe of it. Dr. Home ſays that it produced the ſame effect upon the patients whom he cured by it, in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmary

of Edinburgh. Dr. Sydenham prefers gentle to draſtic purges, and recommends the exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of them every day. Both draſtic and gentle purges act by diminiſhing the action of the arterial ſyſtem, and thereby promote the abſorption and diſcharge of water. That purges promote ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſorption, we learn not only from their effects in dropſies, but from an experiment related by Mr. Cruikſhank<note n="*" place="bottom">Letter to Mr. Clare, p. 117.</note>, of a man who acquired ſeveral ounces of weight after the operation of a purge. The abſorption in this caſe was from the atmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſphere. So great is the effect of purges in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting abſortion, that Mr. Hunter ſuppoſes the matter of a gonorrhoea, or of topical venereal ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to be conveyed by them in ſome inſtances into every part of the body.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>Certain Medicines,</hi> which by leſſening the <hi>action of the arterial ſyſtem,</hi> favour the abſorption and evacuation of water. The only medicines of this claſs which I ſhall name are <hi>nitre, cream of tartar,</hi> and <hi>foxglove.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. TWO ounces of nitre diſſolved in a pint of water, and a wine-glaſs full of it taken three times a-day have performed perfect cures, in two caſes of aſcites, which have come under my notice. I
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:026112_0176_0FCFF401137523E0"/>
think I have cured two perſons of anaſarca, by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one ſcruple of the ſame medicine three times a-day for ſeveral weeks. The two laſt cures were evidently dropſies of too much action in the arte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial ſyſtem. Where nitre has been given in ato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic dropſies it has generally been uſeleſs, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times done harm. I have ſeen one inſtance of an incurable diarrhoea after tapping, which I ſuſpected aroſe from the deſtruction of the tone of the ſtomach and bowels, by large and long continued doſes of nitre, which the patient had previouſly taken by the advice of a perſon who had been cured by that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>remedy. To avoid this, or any other inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence from the uſe of nitre in dropſies, it ſhould be given at firſt in ſmall doſes, and ſhould always be laid aſide, if it ſhould prove ineffectual after having been given two or three weeks.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I CAN ſay nothing of the efficacy of cream of tartar in dropſies from my own experience, where it has not acted as a purge. Perhaps my want of deciſion upon this ſubject has ariſen only from my not having perſiſted in the uſe of it for the ſame length of time which is mentioned by Dr. Home.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THERE has been much inquiry into the manner in which foxglove acts in curing dropſies. It has been ſuppoſed to exert a ſpecific action on
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:026112_0177_0FCFF408436239E8"/>
the kidneys as a diuretic; but I am rather diſpoſed to believe, that it acts only by leſſening the action of the arterial ſyſtem by a ſedative quality which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears to reſide in it. I am led to adopt this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion by the facts which are related by Dr. Darwin, who ſays, that he had ſeen it do ſervice in the dropſy, without producing any immediate dicharge of water, and that it ſeldom ſucceeded until it had previouſly debilitated the body.</p>
            <p>DR. WARREN ſays, that he ſeldom found tonics neceſſary after he had diſcharged the water in the dropſy by this medicine, probably becauſe he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the arterial ſyſtem by it, from an exceſſive to a healthy ſtate of action. And even Dr. Withering, who ſuppoſes the foxglove to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper in plethoric habits, confeſſes that tonics, after its uſe "very often deceived his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions," probably by reproducing the ſame morbid and exceſſive action in the arterial ſyſtem, which he had juſt before removed by means of the fox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glove. I am the more diſpoſed to adopt this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of the manner in which this medicine acts, from obſerving the good effects which are aſcribed to it in vertigo—madneſs—hoemorrhages<note n="*" place="bottom">Ferria<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>.</note>—and pulmonary conſumption, when theſe diſeaſes are
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:026112_0178_0FCFF40B0F8FDF18"/>
accompanied by too much action in the arterial ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>THERE are different opinions concerning the efficacy of this medicine in dropſies. From the the caſes related by Dr. Withering, it appears to have done good; but from thoſe related by Dr. Lettſom<note n="*" place="bottom">Medical Memoirs, vol. II.</note> it ſeems to have done harm. I ſuſpect the different accounts of thoſe two gentlemen have ariſen from their having given it in different ſtates of the ſyſtem. In dropſies of too much action, I believe it has ſometimes been uſed with ſucceſs, but in atonic dropſies, I am ſatisfied that it is not only an uſeleſs but a dangerous medicine. I am ſorry to add further, that after many trials of this me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine I have failed in moſt of the caſes in which I have given it. I have diſcharged the water in three inſtances by it, but the diſeaſe returned, and my patients finally died.—I can aſcribe only one com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete cure to its uſe which was in the year 1789, in a young man in the Pennſylvania hoſpital, of five and thirty years of age, of a robuſt habit, and plethoric pulſe.</p>
            <p>WHERE medicines have once been in uſe, and afterwards fall into diſrepute, as was the caſe with
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:026112_0179_0FCFF40D95BD0488"/>
the Foxglove, I ſuſpect the caſes in which they were uſeful, to have been either few or doubtful, and that the caſes in which they had done harm, were ſo much more numerous and unequivocal, as juſtly to baniſh them from the materia medica.</p>
            <p n="5">V. HARD LABOR, or exerciſe in ſuch a degree as to produce fatigue, have in ſeveral inſtances cured the dropſy. A diſpenſary patient in this city was cured of this diſorder by ſawing wood, And a patient in an aſcites under my care in the Pennſylvania hoſpital, had his belly reduced ſeven inches in circumference in one day, by the labor of carrying wood from the yard into the hoſpital. A ſecond patient belonging to the Pennſylvania Diſpenſary was cured by walking to Lancaſter, 66 miles from the city, in the middle of winter. The efficacy of travelling in this diſorder in cold weather, is taken notice of by Dr. Monroe, who quotes a caſe from Dr. Haller, of a French mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, who was cured of a dropſy by a journey from Paris to England, in the winter ſeaſon. It would ſeem, that in theſe two caſes, the <hi>cold</hi> co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operated as a ſedative with the fatigue produced by labor or exerciſe, in reducing the tone of the arterial ſyſtem.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="178" facs="unknown:026112_0180_0FCFF40EF9CB2E68"/>VI. LOW DIET. I have heard of a woman who was cured of a dropſy by eating nothing but boiled beans for three weeks, and drinking no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but the water in which they had been boiled. Many other caſes of the good effects of low diet in dropſies are to be found on the records of medicine.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. THIRST. This cruel remedy acts by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitating the ſyſtem in two ways; 1ſt, By abſtract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the ſtimulus of diſtention; and, 2dly, By pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting a freſh ſupply of water to replace that which is diſcharged by the ordinary emunctories of nature.</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. FASTING. An accidental circumſtance related by Sir John Hawkins, in the life of Dr. Johnſon, firſt led me to obſerve the good ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of faſting in the dropſy. If the fact alluded to ſtood alone under the preſent head of this eſſay, it would be ſufficient to eſtabliſh the exiſtence of too much action, and the efficacy of debilitating remedies in certain dropſies. I am the more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to lay a good deal of ſtreſs upon this fact, as it was the clue which conducted me out of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byrinth of empirical practice, in which I had been bewildered for many years, and finally led me to adopt the principles and practice which I am now endeavoring to eſtabliſh. The paſſage which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:026112_0181_0FCFF416C8733928"/>
this intereſting fact is as follows. <q>A few days after (ſays Sir John) he [meaning Dr. John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon] ſent for me, and informed me, that he had diſcovered in himſelf the ſymptoms of a dropſy, and indeed, his very much increaſed bulk, and the ſwollen appearance of his legs, ſeemed to indicate no leſs. It was on Thurſday that I had this converſation with him, in the courſe thereof, he declared that he intended to devote the whole of the next day to <hi>faſting,</hi> humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and ſuch other devotional exerciſes as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a man in his ſituation. On the Saturday following I made him a viſit, and upon entering his room, I obſerved in his countenance ſuch a ſerenity as indicated, that ſome remarkable criſis of his diſorder had produced a change in his feelings. He told me, that purſuant to the reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution he had mentioned to me, he had ſpent the preceding day in an abſtraction from all worldly concerns—that to prevent interruption he had in the morning ordered <hi>Frank,</hi> [his ſervant] not to admit any one to him, and the better to enforce the charge, had added theſe awful words, <hi>for your maſter is preparing himſelf to die.</hi> He then men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to me, that in the courſe of this exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe he found himſelf relieved from the diſorder which had been growing upon him, and was becoming very oppreſſive, viz. the <hi>dropſy,</hi> by
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:026112_0182_0FCFF41A1D92E470"/>
the gradual evacuation of water, to the amount of <hi>twenty pints,</hi> a like inſtance whereof he had never before experienced.</q> Sir John Hawkins aſcribes this immenſe diſcharge of water to the influence of Dr. Johnſon's prayers; but he neglects to take notice, that theſe prayers were anſwered in this inſtance, us they are in many others, in a perfect conſiſtence with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon and eſtabliſhed laws of nature.</p>
            <p>TO ſatisfy myſelf that this diſcharge of water, in the caſe of Dr. Johnſon, was produced by the faſting only, I recommended it ſoon after I read the above account to a gentlewoman whom I was then attending in an aſcites. I was delighted with the effects of it. Her urine, which for ſome time be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had not exceeded half a pint a-day, amounted to <hi>two quarts</hi> on the day ſhe faſted. I repeated the ſame preſcription once a week for ſeveral weeks, and each time was informed of an increaſe of urine, though it was conſiderably leſs in the laſt experiments than in the firſt. Two patients in an aſcites, to whom I preſcribed the ſame remedy, in the Pennſylvania Hoſpital, the one in the winter of 1790, and the other in the winter of 1792, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited proofs in the preſence of many of the ſtudents of the univerſity, equally ſatisfactory of
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:026112_0183_0FCFF41DF2C9A9C8"/>
the efficacy of faſting in ſuddenly increaſing the quantity of urine.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. FEAR. This paſſion is evidently of a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitating nature, and therefore, it has frequently afforded an accidental aid in the cure of dropſies, of too much action. I ſuſpect, that the fear of death, which was ſo diſtinguiſhing a part of the character of Dr. Jonhſon, added a good deal to the efficacy of faſting, in procuring the immenſe diſcharge of water beforementioned. In ſupport of the efficacy of fear ſimply applied, in diſcharging water from the body in dropſies, I ſhall mention the following facts.</p>
            <p>IN a letter which I received from Dr. John Pennington, dated Edinburgh, Auguſt 3. 1790, I was favoured with the following communication. <q>Since the converſation I had with you on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the dropſy, I feel more and more inclined to adopt your opinion. I can furniſh you with a fact which I learned from a Daniſh ſailor, on my paſſage to this country, which is much in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of your doctrine. A ſailor in an aſcites, fell off the end of the yard into the ſea; the wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther being calm, he was taken up unhurt, but to uſe the ſailor's own words, who told me the ſtory, he was <hi>frightened half to death,</hi> and as
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:026112_0184_0FCFF41F98D7E4D0"/>
ſoon as he was taken out of the water, he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged a gallon of urine or more. A doctor on board aſcribed this large evacuation to ſea bath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and accordingly ordered the man to be dipped in the ſea every morning, much againſt his will, for my informant adds, that he had not forgotten his fall, and that in four weeks he was perfectly well. I think this fact can only be explained on your principles. The ſedative operation of <hi>fear,</hi> was no doubt the cauſe of his cure<note n="*" place="bottom">There is an account of an aſcites being cured by a fall from an open chaiſe recorded in the third volume of the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dical Memoirs by Mr. Lowdell. I have heard of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete recovery from cropſy, having ſuddenly followed a fall from a horſe. In both theſe caſes may not fear have contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted very much to the cures?</note>.</q>
            </p>
            <p>DR. HALL, of York-town in Pennſylvania, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me, that he had been called to viſit a young woman of 19 years of age, who had taken all the uſual remedies for aſcites without effect. He at once propoſed to her the operation of tapping. To this ſhe objected, but ſo great was the <hi>fear</hi> of this operation, which the propoſal of it ſuddenly excited in her mind, that it brought on a plentiful diſcharge of urine, which in a few days perfectly removed her diſorder.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="183" facs="unknown:026112_0185_0FCFF42153448A78"/>On the 27th of Auguſt, 1790, I viſited a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>woman in this city with the late Dr. Jones, in an aſcites. We told her for the firſt time, that ſhe could not be relieved without being tapped. She appeared to be much terrified upon hearing our opinion, and ſaid that ſhe would conſider of it. I ſaw her two days afterwards, when ſhe told me with a ſmile on her countenance, that ſhe hoped ſhe ſhould get well without tapping, for that ſhe had diſcharged two quarts of water in the courſe of the day after we had adviſed her to ſubmit to that operation. For many days before, ſhe had not diſcharged more than two or three gills in twenty-four hours. The operation, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, was ſtill indicated, and ſhe ſubmitted to be tapped a few days afterwards.</p>
            <p>I TAPPED the ſame gentlewoman a ſecond time in January 1791- She was much terrified while I was preparing for the operation, and fainted im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the puncture was made. The ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time that I viſited her after the operation was performed, ſhe told me (without being interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated on that ſubject) that ſhe had diſcharged a pint and an half of urine, within twenty minutes after I left the room on the day I tapped her. What made this diſcharge the more remarkable
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:026112_0186_0FCFF4276BB09DB8"/>
was, ſhe had not made more than a table ſpoonful of water in a day for ſeveral days before ſhe was tapped.</p>
            <p>I HAVE ſeen ſimilar diſcharges of urine in two other caſes of tapping which have come under my notice, but they reſembled ſo nearly thoſe which have been mentioned, that it will be unneceſſary to record them.</p>
            <p>BUT the influence of fear upon the ſyſtem in the dropſy, extends far beyond the effects which I have aſcribed to it. Dr. Currie, of this city, informed me that he called about four years ago, by appointment to tap a woman. He no ſooner entered the room than he obſerved her, as he thought, to faint away. He attempted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover her, but to no purpoſe. She died of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den paroxyſm of fear.</p>
            <p>IT is a matter of ſurpriſe, that we ſhould have remained ſo long ignorant of the influence of fear upon the urinary organs in dropſies, after having been ſo long familiar with the ſame effect of that paſſion in the hyſteria.</p>
            <p>IN recommending the antiphlogiſtic treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of certain dropſies, I muſt here confine my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the dropſies of ſuch climates as diſpoſe to
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:026112_0187_0FCFF42AAADC6598"/>
diſeaſes of too much action in the ſyſtem. I am ſatisfied that it will often be proper in the middle and eaſtern ſtates of America; and I have lately met with two obſervations, which ſhew that it has been uſed with ſucceſs at Vienna in Germany. Dr. Stoll tells us, that in the month of January, 1780, <q>Hydropic and aſthmatic patients diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed more or leſs marks of inflammatory diatheſis, and that blood was drawn from them with a ſpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring hand with advantage;</q> and in the month of November of the ſame year, he ſays, <q>The ſtronger diuretics injured dropſical patients in this ſeaſon; but an antiphlogiſtic drink, compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed of a quart of the decoction of graſs, with two ounces of ſimple oxymel, and nitre and cream of tartar of each a drachm did ſervice.</q>

               </note> It is probable that the ſame difference ſhould be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved between the treatment of dropſies in warm and cold climates that is obſerved in the treatment of inflammatory fevers. The tonic action probably exiſts in the ſyſtem in both countries. In the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer it reſembles the tides which are ſuddenly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by a ſhower of rain, and as ſuddenly diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear; whereas, in the latter, it may be compared to thoſe tides which are produced by the ſlow and
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:026112_0188_0FCFF42D4C68BE18"/>
gradual addition of water from numerous ſtreams, and which continue for days and weeks together to exhibit marks of violence in every part of their courſe.</p>
            <p>I COME now to ſay a few words upon Atonic Dropſies. They may eaſily be diſtinguiſhed from thoſe which have been deſcribed, by occurring in habits naturally weak; by being produced by the operation of chronic cauſes; by a weak and quick pulſe, and by little or no preternatural heat or thirſt.</p>
            <p>THE Remedies for Atonic Dropſies are all ſuch ſtimulating ſubſtances as increaſe the action of the arterial ſyſtem, or determine the fluids to the uri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary organs. Theſe are,</p>
            <p n="1">I. BITTER and AROMATIC ſubſtances of all kinds exhibited in ſubſtance or in infuſions of wine, ſpirit, beer or water.</p>
            <p n="2">II. CERTAIN ACRID VEGETABLES, ſuch as ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy-graſs, horſe-radiſh, muſtard, water-creſſes, and garlic. I know an old man who was perfectly cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of an anaſarca, by eating water-creſſes, on bread and butter.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="187" facs="unknown:026112_0189_0FCFF42F99FEB190"/>III. OPIUM. The efficacy of this medicine in dropſies has been atteſted by Dr. Willis, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral other practical writers. It ſeems to poſſeſs almoſt an excluſive power of acting alike upon the arterial, the lymphatic, the glandular, and the ner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſyſtems.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. METALLIC TONICS, ſuch as chalybeate medicines of all kinds, and the mild preparations of copper and mercury. I once cured an incipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent aſcites and anaſarca by large doſes of the ruſt of iron; and I have cured many dropſies by giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing mercury in ſuch quantities as to excite a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful ſalivation. I have, it is true, often given it without effect, probably from my former ignorance of the tonic action of the arteries, which ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently occurs in dropſies, and in which caſes, mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cury muſt neceſſarily have done harm.</p>
            <p n="5">V. DIURETICS, conſiſting of alkaline ſaits, ni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre, and the oxymels of ſquills and colchicum. It is difficult to determine how far theſe medicines produce their ſalutary effects by acting directly up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the kidneys. It is remarkable that theſe organs are ſeldom affected in dropſies, and that their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes are rarely followed by dropſical effuſions in any part of the body.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <pb n="188" facs="unknown:026112_0190_0FCF4961C84654F8"/>VI. GENEROUS DIET, conſiſting of animal food, rendered cordial by ſpices; alſo ſound old wine.</p>
            <p n="7">VII. DILUTING DRINKS taken in ſuch large quantites as to excite the action of the veſſels by the ſtimulus of diſtenſion. This effect has been produced, Sir George Baker informs us, by means of large draughts of ſimple water, and of cyder and water<note n="*" place="bottom">The remark upon this fact by Sir George, is worthy of notice, and implies much more than was probably intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it. <q>When common means have failed, ſucceſs has ſometimes followed a method <hi>directly contrary</hi> to the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed practice.</q>——Medical Tranſactions, Vol. II.</note>. The influence of diſtention in promoting abſorption is evident in the urinary and gall blad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, which frequently return their contents to the blood by the lymphatics, when they are unable to diſcharge them through their uſual emunctories. Is it not probable that the diſtention produced by the large quantities of liquids which we are direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to adminiſter after giving the foxglove, may have been the means of performing ſome of thoſe cures of dropſies, which have been aſcribed to that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy?</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="189" facs="unknown:026112_0191_0FCFF431D9FE0D80"/>VIII. PRESSURE. Bandages bound tightly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>round the belly and limbs, ſometimes prevent the increaſe or return of dropſical ſwellings. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of preſſure upon the action of the lympha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics appears in the abſorption of bone which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently follows the preſſure of contiguous tumors, alſo in the abſorption of fleſh which follows the long preſſure of certain parts of the body upon a ſick bed.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. FRICTIONS, either by means of a dry, or oiled hand, or with linen or flannel impregnated with volatile and other ſtimulating ſubſtances. I have found evident advantages from following the advice of Dr. Cullen, by rubbing the lower extre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities <hi>upwards,</hi> and that only in the <hi>morning.</hi>— I have been at a loſs to account for the manner in which ſweet oil acts when applied to dropſical ſwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings. If it act by a ſedative power upon the blood-veſſels, it will be more proper in tonic than atonic dropſies; but if it act by cloſing the pores, and thereby preventing the abſorption of moiſture from the air, it will be very proper in the ſpecies of drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy which is now under conſideration. It is in this manner that Dr. Cullen ſuppoſes that ſweet oil, when applied to the body, cures that ſpecies of diabetes in which nothing but inſipid water is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged from the bladder.</p>
            <p n="10">
               <pb n="190" facs="unknown:026112_0192_0FCFF437E9058A88"/>X. HEAT applied either ſeparately or combined with moiſture in the form of warm or vapor baths, has often been uſed with ſucceſs in dropſies of too little action. Dampier in his voyage round the world was cured of a dropſy by means of a copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſweat excited by burying himſelf in a bed of warm ſand. Warm fomentations to the legs ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered moderately ſtimulating by the addition of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>line or aromatic ſubſtances, have often done ſervice in the atonic dropſical ſwellings of the lower ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremities.</p>
            <p n="11">XI. THE COLD-BATH. I can ſay nothing in favor of the efficacy of this remedy in dropſies, from my own experience. Its good effects ſeem to depend wholly on its encreaſing the excitability of the ſyſtem to common ſtimuli, by the diminution of its excitement. If this be the caſe, I would aſk, whether FEAR might not be employed for the ſame purpoſe, and thus become as uſeful in atonic, as it was formerly proved to be in tonic dropſies.</p>
            <p n="12">XII. WOUNDS, whether excited by cutting in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments, or by fire, provided they excite inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and action in the arteries, frequently cure atonic dropſies. The good effects of inflammation, and action in theſe caſes appear in the cure of hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drocele by means of the needle, or the cauſtic.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="191" facs="unknown:026112_0193_0FCFF43F77AAFA00"/>XIII. EXERCISE. This is probably as neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in the atonic dropſy, as it is in the conſumption, and ſhould never be omitted when a patient is able to take it. The paſſive exerciſes of ſwinging, and riding in a carriage are moſt proper in the loweſt ſtage of the diſorder; but as ſoon as the patient's ſtrength will admit of it, he ſhould ride en horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>back. A journey ſhould be preferred in this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, to ſhort excurſions from home.</p>
            <p>IN the application of each of the remedies which has been mentioned for the cure of both tonic and atonic Dropſies, great care ſhould be taken to uſe them in ſuch a manner, as to accommodate them to the ſtrength and excitability of the patient's ſyſtem. The moſt powerful remedies have often been ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered <hi>hurtful</hi> by being given in too large doſes in the beginning; and <hi>uſeleſs</hi> by being given in too ſmall doſes, in the ſubſequent ſtages of the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
            <p>I HAVE avoided ſaying any thing of the uſual o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations for diſcharging water from different parts of the body, as my deſign was to treat only of the ſymptoms and cure of thoſe dropſies which affect the whole ſyſtem. I ſhall only remark, that if tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and punctures have been more ſucceſsful in the early, than in the late ſtage of theſe diſorders,
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:026112_0194_0FCFF245D1499920"/>
it is probably becauſe the ſudden or gradual eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of water takes down that exceſſive action in the arterial ſyſtem, which is moſt common in their early ſtage, and thereby favours the ſpeedy reſtoration of healthy action in the exhaling or lymphatic veſſels.</p>
            <p>THUS have I endeavoured to prove, that two diſtinct and oppoſite ſtates of action take place in dropſies, and have mentioned the remedies which are proper for each of them under ſeparate heads. But I ſuſpect that dropſies are often connected with a certain intermediate or mixed action in the arterial ſyſtem analogous to the typhoid action which takes place in certain fevers. I am led to adopt this opinion, not only from having obſerved mixed action to be ſo univerſal in moſt of the diſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of the arterial and nervous ſyſtem, but becauſe I have ſo frequently obſerved dropſical ſwellings to follow the ſcarlatina, and the puerperile ſever, two diſeaſes which appear to derive their peculiar cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter from a mixture of exceſs and deficiency of <hi>force,</hi> combined with irregularity of action in the arterial <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>. In dropſic, of mixed action where too much force prevails in the action of ſome, and too little in the action of other of the arterial fibres, the remedies muſt be debilitating or ſtimulating,
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:026112_0195_0FCFF2475045D520"/>
according to the greater or leſs predominance of to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic or atonic diatheſis in the arterial ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>I SHALL conclude this hiſtory of dropſies, and of the different and oppoſite remedies which have cured them, by the follewing obſervations.</p>
            <p>WE learn, in the firſt place, from what has been ſaid, the impropriety and even danger of preſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing ſtimulating medicines indiſcriminately in every caſe of dropſy.</p>
            <p n="2">2. WE are taught by the facts which have been mentioned, the reaſon why phyſicians have differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo much in their accounts of the ſame remedies, and why the ſame remedies have operated ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferently in the hands of the ſame phyſicians. It is becauſe they have been given without a refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the two different ſtates of the ſyſtem, which have been deſcribed. Dr. Sydenham ſays, that he cured the firſt dropſical patient he was call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, by frequent purges. He began to exult in the diſcovery, as he thought, of a certain cure for dropſies, but his triumph was of ſhort duration. The ſame remedy failed in the next caſe in which he preſcribed it. The reaſon probably was, the dropſy in the firſt caſe, was of a tonic, but in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, of an atonic nature; for the latter was an aſcites from a quartan ague. It is agreeable, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to diſcover, from the theory of dropſies which has been laid down, that all the different remedies
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:026112_0196_0FCFF24CD86F9D80"/>
for theſe diſorders have been proper in their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and improper only in the ſtate of the ſyſtem in which they have been given. As the diſcovery of truth in religion reconciles the principles of the moſt oppoſite ſects; ſo the diſcovery of truth in medicine, reconciles the moſt oppoſite modes of practice. It would be happy if the inquirers after truth in medicine ſhould be taught by ſuch diſcove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, to treat each other with tenderneſs and reſpect, and to wait with patience till accident, or time, ſhall combine into one perfect and conſiſtent ſyſtem, all the contradictory facts and opinions about which phyſicians have been ſo long divided.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IF a ſtate of exceſſive action in the arteries has been demonſtrated in dropſies, both from its ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms and remedies, and if theſe dropſies are evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently produced by previous debility, who will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the exiſtence of exceſſive action in certain hae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrhages, in gout, palſy, apoplexy, and madneſs, notwithſtanding they are all the offspring of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſing debility? And who will deny the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of bleeding, purges, and other debilitating medicines in certain ſtates of thoſe diſorders, that has ſeen the ſame medicines adminiſtered with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in certain dropſies? To reject bleeding, pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging, and the other remedies for exceſſive action in the ſyſtem, in either of the above diſeaſes, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that action was preceded by general debility,
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:026112_0197_0FCFF251D38B2898"/>
will lead us to reject them in the moſt acute inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory fevers, for theſe are as much the offspring of previous debility as dropſies or palſy. The previous debility of the former, differs from that of the latter diſeaſes, only in being of a more ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute, or, in other words, of a ſhorter duration.</p>
            <p n="4">4. FROM the ſymptoms of tonic dropſy which have been mentioned, it follows, that the diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of apoplexy into ſerous and ſanguineous, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fords no rational indication for a difference in the mode of treating that diſorder. If an effuſion of ſerum in the thorax, bowels, or limbs, produce a hard and full pulſe, it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe that the ſame ſymptom will be produced by the effuſion of ſerum in the brain. But the diſſections collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Lieutaud,<note n="*" place="bottom">Hiſtoria Anatomico Medica. Vol. ii.</note> place this opinion beyond all controverſy. They prove that the ſymptoms of too much, and too little action, as they appear in the pulſe, follow alike the effuſion of ſerum and blood in the brain. This fact will admit of an important application to the diſeaſe, which is to be the ſubject of the next inquiry.</p>
            <p n="5">5. FROM the influence which has been deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed, of the different ſtates of action of the arterial ſyſtem, upon the lymphatic veſſels, in dropſies, we are led to reject the indiſcriminate uſe of bark,
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:026112_0198_0FCFF25357A58338"/>
mercury, and ſalt water, in the ſcrophula. When the action of the arteries is weak, thoſe remedies are proper; but when an oppoſite ſtate of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial ſyſtem occurs, and above all, when ſcro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phulous tumours are attended with inflammatory ulcers, ſtimulating medicines of all kinds are hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. By alternating the above remedies with a milk and vegetable diet, according to the tonic, or atonic ſtates of the arterial ſyſtem, I have lately ſucceeded in a caſe of ſcrophula, attended by large ulcers in the inguinal glands, which had for ſeveral years reſiſted the conſtant uſe of the three ſtimulating remedies which have been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p n="6">6. NOTWITHSTANDING I have ſuppoſed drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies to be connected with a peculiar ſtate of force in the blood veſſels, yet I have not ventured to aſſert, that dropſies may not exiſt from an exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive affection of the exhaling and abſorbing veſſels. I conceive this to be as poſſible, as for a fever to exiſt from an excluſive affection of the arteries, or an hyſteria, from an excluſive affection of the nervous ſyſtem. Nothing, however, can be ſaid upon this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, until phyſiology and pathology have taught us more of the ſtructure and diſeaſes of the lymphatic veſſels. Nor have I ventured further to aſſert, that there are not medicines which may act ſpecifically upon the lymphatics independently of the arteries.
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:026112_0199_0FCFF254E91741B0"/>
This, I conceive to be as poſſible as for affafoetida to act chiefly upon the nerves, or ipecacuana and jalap upon the alimentary canal, without affecting other parts of the ſyſtem. Until ſuch medicines are diſcovered, it becomes us to avail ourſelves of the acceſs to the lymphatics, which is furniſhed us through the medium of the arteries by means of moſt of the remedies which have been mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p n="7">7. IF it ſhould appear hereafter, that we have leſſened the mortality of certain dropſies by the theory and practice which have been propoſed, yet many caſes of dropſy muſt ſtill occur in which they will afford us no aid. The caſes I allude to, are dropſies from encloſing cyſts, from the oſſifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of certain arteries, from ſchirri of certain viſcera, from large ruptures of exhaling or lym<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phatic veſſels, from a peculiar and corroſive acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of the fluids, and laſtly, from an exhauſted ſtate of the whole ſyſtem. The records of medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine furniſh us with inſtances of death from each of the above cauſes. But let us not deſpair. It becomes a phyſician to believe, that there is no diſeaſe neceſſarily incurable; and that there exiſt in the womb of time, certain remedies for all thoſe diſorders which elude the preſent limits of the healing art.</p>

            <p>AN INQUIRY INTO THE CAUSES AND CURE OF THE <hi>INTERNAL DROPSY OF THE BRAIN.</hi>

         <div type="inquiry">
            <pb facs="unknown:026112_0201_0FCFF25E02C75590"/>
            <head>INQUIRY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>HAVING for many years been unſucceſsful in all the caſes, except two, of internal dropſy of the brain, which came under my care, I began to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain doubts of the common theory of this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and to ſuſpect that inſtead of being conſidered as an idiopathic dropſy, the effuſion of water ſhould be conſidered only as the effect of a primary inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation or congeſtion of blood in the brain.</p>
            <p>I MENTIONED this opinion to my colleague Dr. Wiſtar in the month of June 1788, and taught it the winter following in my lectures. The year afterwards I was confirmed in it by hearing that the
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:026112_0202_0FCFF25F5D4FEFD0"/>
ſame idea had occurred to Dr. Quin. I have ſince read Dr. Quin's treatiſe on the dropſy of the brain with great pleaſure, and conſider it as the firſt dawn of light which has been ſhed upon the the<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ory of this diſorder. In purſuing this ſubject, therefore, I ſhall avail myſelf of Dr. Quin's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries, and endeavour to arrange the facts and obſervations I have collected in ſuch a manner, as to form a connected theory from them, which I hope will lead to a new and more ſucceſsful mode of treating this diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>I SHALL begin this Inquiry by delivering a few general propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE Internal Dropſy of the Brain is a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der confined chiefly to children.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IN children the brain is larger in proportion to other parts of the body, than it is in adults; and of courſe a greater proportion of blood is ſent to it in childhood, than in the ſubſequent periods of life.—The effects of this determination of blood to the brain appear in the mucous diſcharge from the noſe, and in the ſores on the head and behind the ears, which are ſo common in childhood.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="203" facs="unknown:026112_0203_0FCF49342AD3EDA0"/>3. IN all febrile diſeaſes there is a preternatural determination of blood to the brain. This occurs in a more eſpecial manner in children; hence the reaſon why they are ſo apt to be affected by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vulſions in the eruptive fever of the ſmall-pox, in dentition, in the diſeaſes from worms, and in the firſt paroxyſm of intermitting fevers.</p>
            <p n="4">4. IN fevers of every kind, and in every ſtage of life, there is a diſpoſition to effuſion in that part to which there is the greateſt determination. Thus in inflammatory fever, effuſions take place in the lungs and in the joints. In the bilious fever they occur in the liver, and in the gout in every part of of the body. The matter effuſed is always influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced by the ſtructure of the part in which it takes place.</p>
            <p>THESE propoſitions being premiſed, I ſhould have proceeded to mention the remote cauſes of this diſorder; but as this inquiry may poſſibly fall into the hands of ſome gentlemen who may not have acceſs to the deſcription of it as given by Dr. Whytt, Dr. Fothergill, and Dr. Quin, I ſhall intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce a hiſtory of its ſymptoms taken from the laſt of thoſe authors. I prefer it to the hiſtories by Dr. Whytt and Dr. Fothergill, as it accords moſt
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:026112_0204_0FCFF261E0C38708"/>
with the ordinary phaenomena of this diſorder in this country.</p>
            <q>
               <p>IN general the patient is at firſt languid and inactive, often drowſy and peeviſh, but at inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vals cheerful and apparently free from complaint. The appetite is weak, a nauſea, and in many caſes a vomiting occurs once or twice in the day, and the ſkin is obſerved to be hot and dry towards the evenings: ſoon after theſe ſymptoms have appeared, the patient is affected with a ſharp head-ach, chiefly in the fore-part, or if not there, generally in the crown of the head: it is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, however, confined to one ſide of the head, and, in that caſe, when the poſture of the body is erect, the head often inclines to the ſide affected. We frequently find alſo, that the head-ach alternates with the affection of the ſtomach; the vomiting being leſs troubleſome when the pain is moſt violent, and <hi>vice verſâ</hi>; other parts of the body are likewiſe ſubject to temporary at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacks of pain, viz. the extremities, or the bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els, but more conſtantly the back of the neck, and between the ſcapulae; in all ſuch caſes the head is more free from uneaſineſs.</p>
               <p>THE patient diſlikes the light at this period; cries much, ſleeps little, and when he does ſleep, he grinds his teeth, picks his noſe, appears to be
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:026112_0205_0FCFF263CF9C0478"/>
uneaſy, and ſtarts often, ſcreaming as if he were terrified; the bowels are in the majority of ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes very much confined, though it ſometimes happens that they are in an oppoſite ſtate: the pulſe in this early ſtage of the diſorder, does not uſually indicate any material derangement.</p>
               <p>WHEN the ſymptoms above mentioned have continued for a few days, ſubject as they always are in this diſeaſe to great fluctuation, the axis of one eye is generally found to be turned in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the noſe; the pupil on this ſide is rather more dilated than the other; and when both eyes have the axes directed inwards, (which ſometimes happens,) both pupils are larger than they are obſerved to be in the eyes of healthy perſons: the vomiting becomes more conſtant, and the head-ach more excruciating; every ſymptom of fever then makes its appearance, the pulſe is frequent, and the breathing quick; exacerbations of the fever take place towards the evening, and the face is occaſionally fluſhed; uſually one cheek is much more affected than the other; temporary perſpirations likewiſe break forth, which are not followed by any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviation of diſtreſs; a diſcharge of blood from
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:026112_0206_0FCFF269D9BD9598"/>
the noſe, which ſometimes appears about this period, is equally inefficacious.</p>
               <p>DELIRIUM, and that of the moſt violent kind, particularly if the patient has arrived at the age of puberty, now takes place, and with all the preceding ſymptoms of fever, continues for a while to increaſe, until about fourteen days, often a much ſhorter ſpace of time ſhall have elapſed ſince the appearance of the ſymptoms, which were firſt mentioned in the above detail.</p>
               <p>THE diſeaſe then undergoes that remarkable change, which ſometimes ſuddenly points out the commencement of, what has been called its ſecond ſtage: the pulſe becomes ſlow but une<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual, both as to its ſtrength, and the intervals between the pulſations; the pain of the head; or of whatever part had previouſly been affected, ſeems to abate, or at leaſt the patient becomes apparently leſs ſenſible of it; the interrupted ſlumbers, or perpetual reſtleſſneſs which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed during the earlier periods of the diſorder, are now ſucceeded by an almoſt lethargic tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>por, the ſtrabiſmus, and dilatation of the pupil increaſe, the patient lies with one, or both eyes half cloſed, which, when minutely examined, are often found to be completely inſenſible to
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:026112_0207_0FCFF26C8D6B1EA0"/>
light; the vomiting caſes; whatever food or medicine is offered is uſually ſwallowed with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent voracity; the bowels at this period ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally remain obſtinately coſtive.</p>
               <p>IF every effort made by art fails to excite the ſinking powers of life, the ſymptoms of what has been called the ſecond ſtage are ſoon ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by others, which more certainly an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce the approach of death.—The pulſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain becomes equal, but ſo weak and quick, that it is almoſt impoſſible to count it; a difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of breathing, nearly reſembling the <hi>Ster<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Apoplecticus,</hi> is often obſerved; ſometimes the eyes are ſuffuſed with blood, the fluſhing of the face is more frequent than before, but of ſhorter duration, and followed by a deadly pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; red ſpots, or blotches ſometimes appear on the body and limbs; deglutition becomes difficult, and convulſions generally cloſe the ſcene. In one caſe, I may obſerve, the jaws of a child of four years of age were ſo firmly look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for more than a day before death, that it was impoſſible to introduce either food or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine into his mouth; and in another caſe, an haemiplegia, attended with ſome remarkable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, occurred during the two days pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding diſſolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="208" facs="unknown:026112_0208_0FCF49355EC4E460"/>HAVING thus given as exact an hiſtory of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poplexia Hydrocephalica</hi> as I could compile from the writings of others, and from my own obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, I ſhould think myſelf guilty of impoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on my readers if I did not caution them that it muſt be conſidered merely as a general outline; the human brain ſeems to be ſo ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely capricious (if the expreſſion may be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed) in the ſignals it gives to other parts of the ſyſtem, of the injury it ſuffers throughout the courſe of this diſeaſe, that although every ſymptom above mentioned does occaſionally oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, and indeed few caſes of the diſeaſe are to be met with, which do not exhibit many of them; yet it does not appear to me, that any one of them is conſtantly, and inſeparably connected with it.</p>
            </q>
            <p>TO this hiſtory I ſhall add a few facts, which are the reſult of obſervations made by myſelf, or communicated to me by my medical brethren.— Theſe facts will ſerve to ſhew that there are many deviations from the hiſtory of the diſorder which has been given, and that it is indeed as Dr Quin has happily expreſſed it, of "a truly proteiform" nature.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="209" facs="unknown:026112_0209_0FCFF26D9BA22860"/>I HAVE not found the dilated and inſenſible pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pil, the puking, the delirium, or the ſtrabiſmus, to attend univerſally in this diſeaſe.</p>
            <p>I SAW one caſe in which the appetite was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>impaired from the firſt to the laſt ſtage of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.</p>
            <p>I HAVE met with one caſe in which the diſorder was attended by blindneſs, and another by double viſion.</p>
            <p>I HAVE obſerved an uncommon acuteneſs in hearing to attend two caſes of this diſorder. In one of them the noiſe of the ſparks which were diſcharged from a hiccory fire, produced great pain and ſtartings which threatened convulſions.</p>
            <p>I HAVE ſeen three caſes in which the diſeaſe terminated in hemiplegia. In two of them it proved fatal in a few days—in the third it has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued for nearly eighteen months.</p>
            <p>I HAVE met with one caſe in which no preter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural ſlowneſs, or intermiſſion was ever perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the pulſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="210" facs="unknown:026112_0210_0FCFF271CCC25798"/>I HAVE ſeen the diſeaſe in children of nearly all ages. I once ſaw it in a child of ſix weeks old. It was preceded by the cholera infantum.</p>
            <p>IN the month of March 1771, I obtained a gill of water from the ventricles of the brain of a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ero girl of nine years of age, who died of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, who complained in no ſtage of it of a pain in her head or limbs, nor of a ſick ſtomach. The diſorder in this caſe was introduced ſuddenly by a pain in the breaſt, a fever, and the uſual ſymptoms of a catarrh.</p>
            <p>DR. WISTAR informed me that he had likewiſe met with a caſe of internal dropſy of the brain, in which there was a total abſence of pain in the head.</p>
            <p>DR. CARSON informed me that he had attended a child in this diſorder that diſcovered, for ſome days before it died, the ſymptom of hydrophobia.</p>
            <p>DR.

            <p>MY former pupil, Dr. Woodhouſe, has furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me with a diſſection in which the diſeaſe was evidently the effect of the remitting fever. That ſpecies or ſtate of continual fever which has been diſtinguiſhed by the name of typhus, is often the
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:026112_0212_0FCFF27534F52CB8"/>
remote cauſe of this diſorder. The languor and weakneſs in all the muſcles of voluntary motion, the head-ach, the inclination to reſt and ſleep, and the diſpoſition to be diſturbed, or terrified by dreams, which are ſaid to be the precurſors of wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the brain, I believe are frequently ſymptoms of a typhus fever which terminates in an inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or effuſion of water in the brain.—The hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry which is given of the typhus ſtate of fever in children by Dr. Butter<note n="*" place="bottom">Treatiſe on the Inſantile Remitting Fever.</note>, ſeems to favor this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>

with unuſual pains in her head. Theſe rapidly increaſed ſo as to occaſion frequent ſcreamings. The cough, which had before been extremely violent, and was attended with ſtitches in the breaſt, now abated, and in a few days ceaſed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt entirely. The pupils of the eyes became dilated, a ſtrabiſmus enſued, and in about a week death put an end to her agonies. Whether this affection of the head aroſe from the effuſion of water or of blood, is uncertain, but its influence on the ſtate of the lungs is worthy of notice.</q> Dr. Quin likewiſe mentions a caſe from Dr. Cullen's private practice, in which an internal dropſy of the brain followed a pulmonary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption. Lieutaud mentions, three caſes of the ſame kind<note n="†" place="bottom">Hiſtoria Anatomica-Medica, Vol. II. Lib. tertius.

            <p n="6">6. FROM the diſſections of Lieutaud, Quin, and others, it appears further, that the internal dropſy of the brain has been obſerved to ſucceed each of the following diſorders—viz. The colic— palſy—melancholly—dyſentery—dentition—inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation—ſcrophula—and the ſudden healing of old ſores. I have ſeen two caſes of it from the laſt cauſe, and one in which it was produced by the action of the vernal ſun alone upon the ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>FROM the facts which have been enumerated, and from diſſections to be mentioned hereafter, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that the diſeaſe in its firſt ſtage is the effect of cauſes which produce a leſs degree of that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation which conſtitutes phrenitis, and that its ſecond ſtage is the effect of a leſs degree of that ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion, which produces ſerous apoplexy in adults.
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:026112_0215_0FCFF2830C2C93C0"/>
The former partakes of the nature of the chronic inflammation of Dr. Cullen, and of the aſthenic inflammation of Dr. Brown. I have taken the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to call it <hi>Phrenicula,</hi> from its being a dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutive ſpecies or ſtate of phrenitis. It bears the ſame relation to phrenitis when it ariſes from indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect cauſes, which pneumonicula does to pneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony,—and it is produced nearly in the ſame manner as the pulmonary conſumption, by debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating cauſes which act primarily on the whole ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem. The peculiar ſize and texture of the brain, ſeem to invite the inflammation and effuſions which follow debility, to that organ in childhood, juſt as the peculiar ſtructure and ſituation of the lungs invite the ſame morbid phaenomena, after the body has acquired its growth, in youth and middle life. In the latter ſtage which has been mentioned, the internal dropſy of the brain par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes of ſome of the properties of apoplexy. It differs from it in being the effect of a <hi>ſlow,</hi> inſtead of a <hi>ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den</hi> effuſion of water or blood, and in being the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of cauſes which are of an acute inſtead of a chronic nature. The more advanced perſons are in life who are affected by this diſorder, the more it approaches to the nature of the common apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy, by a ſpeedy termination in life or death. Dr. Cullen has called it ſimply by the name of "apoplexia hydrocephalica." I have preferred for
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:026112_0216_0FCFF284146F9140"/>
this ſtage of the diſorder the term of <hi>chronic apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy</hi>; for I believe with Dr. Quin, that it has no connection with an hydropic diatheſis of the whole ſyſtem. I am forced to adopt this opinion, from my having never ſeen it accompanied by dropſical effuſions in other parts of the body, nor a general dropſy accompanied by an internal dropſy of the brain. No more occurs in this diſeaſe than takes place when hydrothorax follows an inflammation of the lungs, or when ſerous effuſions follow a in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammation of the joints. I do not ſuppoſe that both inflammation, and effuſion always attend in this diſorder; on the contrary, diſſections have ſhewn ſome caſes of inflammation, with little or no effuſion, and ſome of effuſion without inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Perhaps this variety may have been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the different ſtages of the diſeaſe in which death and the inſpection of the brain took place. Neither do I ſuppoſe, that the two ſtages which have been mentioned, always ſucceed each other in the common order of inflammation and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. In every caſe where the full tenſe—ſlow and intermitting pulſe occurs, I believe there is inflammation; and as this ſtate of the pulſe occurs in moſt caſes in the beginning of the diſorder, I ſuppoſe the inflammation, in moſt caſes, to precede the effuſion of water. I have met with only one caſe in which the ſlow and
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:026112_0217_0FCFF28590BBFF20"/>
tenſe pulſe was abſent; and out of ſix diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſections of patients whom I have loſt by this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, the brains of four of them exhibited marks of inflammation.</p>
            <p>HAVING adopted the theory of this diſeaſe, which I have delivered ſeveral years ago, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved upon ſuch a change in my practice as ſhould accord with it. The firſt remedy indicated by it was</p>

               <p>ON the 15th of November, 1790, I was called to viſit the daughter of W— W——, aged four years, who was indiſpoſed with a cough—a pain in her bowels—a coma—great ſenſibility of her eyes to light—coſtiveneſs—and a ſuppreſſion of urine—a ſlow and irregular, but tenſe pulſe—di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated pupils, but no headach. I found upon inquiry, that ſhe had received a hurt on her head by a fall, about ſeven weeks before I ſaw her. From this information, as well as from her ſymptoms, I had no doubt of the diſorder being the internal dropſy of the brain. I adviſed the loſs of five ounces of blood, which gave her ſome relief. The blood

was ſizy. The next day ſhe took a doſe of jalap and calomel, which operated twelve times. On the 18th ſhe loſt four ounces more of blood, which was more ſizy than that drawn on the 15th. From this time ſhe mended rapidly. Her coma left her on the 20th, and her appetite returned; on the 21ſt, ſhe made a large quantity of turbid dark co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loured urine. On the 22d her pulſe became again a little tenſe, for which ſhe took a gentle puke. On the 23d ſhe had a natural ſtool.

               <head>CASE VII.</head>
               <p>A YOUNG woman of 18 years of age—a hired ſervant in the family of Mrs. E. S. had been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a head-ach every ſpring for ſeveral years. The unuſually warm days which occurred in the beginning of April 1793, produced a return of this periodical pain. On the eighth of the month, it was ſo ſevere as to confine her to her bed. I was called to viſit her on the 9th. I found her comatoſe, and when awake, delirious. Her pupil was unuſually dilated, and inſenſible to the light. She was conſtantly ſick at her ſtomach, and vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed frequently. Her bowels were obſtinately co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtive, and her pulſe was full, tenſe, and ſo ſlow as ſeldom to exceed, for ſeveral days, from 56 to 60 ſtrokes in a minute. I ordered her to looſe ten ounces of blood every day for three days ſucceſſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and gave her, on each of thoſe days, ſtrong doſes of jalap and aloes. The laſt blood which was drawn from her was ſizy. The purges procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from three to ten diſcharges every day from her bowels. On the 12th, ſhe appeared to be much better. Her pulſe was leſs tenſe, and beat 80 ſtrokes in a minute. On the 14th, ſhe had a fainting fit. On the 15th, ſhe ſat up, and called for food. The pupils of her eyes now recovered their ſenſibility
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:026112_0223_0FCFF2939FBA3528"/>
to light, as well as their natural ſize. Her head-ach left her, and on the 17th, ſhe appeared to be in good health. Her pulſe, however, continued to beat between 50 and 60 ſtrokes only in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute, and retained a ſmall portion of irregular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſeveral days after ſhe recovered.</p>
               <p>I AM the more diſpoſed to pronounce the caſes which have been deſcribed to have been internal dropſy of the brain, from my having never been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in a ſingle caſe in which I have examined the brains of patients whom I have ſuſpected to have died of it.</p>
               <p>I BELIEVE, with Dr. Quin, that this diſorder is much more frequent than is commonly ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. I can recollect many caſes of anomalous fever and head-ach in children, which have exci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the moſt diſtreſſing apprehenſions of an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching internal dropſy of the brain, but which have yielded in a few days to bleeding, or to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges and bliſters. I think it probable, that ſome, or perhaps moſt of theſe caſes, might have termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in an effuſion of water in the brain, had they been left to themſelves, or not been treated with the above remedies. I believe further, that it is often prevented by all thoſe phyſicians who treat the firſt ſtage of febrile diſeaſes in children with
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:026112_0224_0FCFF294C804CBA0"/>
evacuations, juſt as the pulmonary conſumption is prevented by bleeding, and low diet, in an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matory catarrh.</p>
               <p>I AM ſorry, however, to add in this place, that I have failed in five caſes, in which I uſed the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy of blood-letting in the phrenicula, or in the inflammatory ſtage of this diſorder; perhaps it was not uſed ſo copiouſly as the diſeaſe required. If the relation of this diſorder to pneumonicula be the ſame in its cure, that I have ſuppoſed it to be in its cauſe, then I am perſuaded, that the ſame ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in blood-letting is indicated in it, above what is neceſſary in phrenitis, that has been practiſed in pneumonicula, above what is neceſſary in the cure of an acute inflammation of the lungs. The continuance, and in ſome inſtances, the increaſe of the appetite in the internal dropſy of the brain, would ſeem to favour this opinion no leſs in this diſorder, than in the inflammatory ſtate of pulmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary conſumption. Where the internal dropſy is obviouſly the effect of a fall, or of any other cauſe which acts <hi>directly</hi> on the brain, there can be no doubt of the ſafety of very plentiful bleeding; all practical writers upon ſurgery concur in adviſing it. Dr. Penington has favoured me with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from Mr Cline's manuſcript lectures upon anatomy, delivered in London in the winter of 1792, which places the advantage of blood-letting,
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:026112_0225_0FCFF29DD12A8BE8"/>
in that ſpecies of inflammation which follows a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal injury of the brain, in a very ſtrong point of light. <q>I know (ſays he) that ſeveral practition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers object to the uſe of evacuations, as remedies for concuſſions of the brain, becauſe of the weakneſs of the pulſe, but in theſe caſes, the pulſe is <hi>depreſſed.</hi> Beſides experience ſhews, that evacuations are frequently attended with very great advantages. I remember a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able caſe of a man in this [St. Thomas's hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal] who was under the care of Mr. Baker. He lay in a comatoſe ſtate, for three weeks after an injury of the head. During that time, he was bled <hi>twenty</hi> times, that is to ſay, he was bled once every day upon an average. He was bled twice a day <hi>plentifully,</hi> but towards the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion, he was bled more ſparingly, and only every other day; but at each bleeding, there were taken, upon an average, about ſixteen oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of blood. In conſequence of this treatment, the man perfectly recovered his health and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon.</q>
               </p>
               <p>A II. remedy to be uſed in the firſt ſtage of this diſorder is PURGES. I have conſtantly obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved all the patients whoſe caſes have been related, to be relieved by plentiful and repeated evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the bowels. I was led to the uſe of
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:026112_0226_0FCFF29F1EC6CCA8"/>
frequent purges, by having long obſerved their good effects in palſies, and other caſes of congeſtion in the brain, where blood letting was unſafe, and where it had been uſed without benefit. In the Leipſic Commentaries,<note n="*" place="bottom">Vol. xxix. p. 139.</note> there is an account of a caſe of internal dropſy of the brain, which follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the meaſles, being cured by no other medicines than purges and diuretics. I can ſay nothing in favor of the latter remedy, in this diſorder, from my own experience. The digitalis purpurea, has been uſed in this city, by ſeveral reſpectable practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioners, but I believe, in no one inſtance with any advantage.</p>
               <p n="3">III. BLISTERS have been uniformly recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by all practical writers upon this diſeaſe. I have applied them to the head, neck and temples, and generally with obvious relief to the pain in the head. They ſhould be omitted in no ſtage of the diſorder; for even in the inflammatory ſtage, the diſcharge they occaſion from the veſſels of the head, greatly overbalances their ſtimulating effects upon the whole ſyſtem.</p>

Out of all the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes in which I gave it, before the year 1790, I ſucceeded in only two—one of them was a child of three years old, the other was a young woman of 26 years of age. I am the more ſatisfied that the latter caſe was internal dropſy of the brain, from my patient having relapſed, and died between two and three years afterwards, of the ſame diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Perhaps my repeated failures in the uſe of this remedy, were occaſioned by my giving it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the inflammatory action of the ſyſtem was ſufficiently ſubdued, by previous evacuations. The ſame rule ſhould probably be obſerved in giving it in this diſorder, which is practiſed in adminiſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in effuſions of water in other parts of the body, and in all other diſeaſes of diminiſhed action in the ſyſtem. In none of the caſes, except the 5th, in which I uſed bleeding and purging with ſucceſs, did I preſcribe calomel with any other view than to encreaſe the evacuation from the bowels.</p>
               <p n="5">V. LINEN CLOTHS wetted with cold vinegar or water, and applied to the forehead, contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute very much to relieve the pain in the head. In the caſe of I. C.<note n="*" place="bottom">Caſe II.</note> the ſolution of ice in the vinegar appeared to afford the moſt obvious relief of this diſtreſſing ſymptom.</p>

                  <pb n="228" facs="unknown:026112_0228_0FCFF2A280437D58"/>A PUNCTURE in the brain has been propoſed by ſome writers to diſcharge the water from its ventricles. If the theory I have delivered be true, the operation promiſes nothing, even though it could always be performed with perfect ſafety. In caſes of local injuries, or of inflammation from any cauſe, it muſt neceſſarily increaſe the diſorder; and in caſes of effuſion only, the debilitated ſtate of the whole ſyſtem forbids us to hope for any relief from ſuch a local remedy.</p>
               <p>BARK, wine, and opium promiſe much more ſucceſs in the laſt ſtage of the diſorder. I can ſay nothing in their favor from my own experience; but from the aid they afford to mercury in other diſeaſes, I conceive they might be made to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany it with advantage.</p>

            <head>AN ACCOUNT OF THE MEASLES, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE weather, in December 1788, and in Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary 1789, was variable, but ſeldom very cold. On the firſt of February 1789, at 6 oclock in the morning, the mercury in Farenheit's ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometer, fell five degrees below 0 in the city of Philadelphia. At twenty miles from the city, on the Schuylkill, it fell 12<hi rend="sup">0</hi> below 0, at the ſame
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:026112_0231_0FCFF2B129A915B8"/>
hour. On the 19th and 20th of this month, there fell a quantity of ſnow, the depth of which, upon an average, was ſuppoſed to be about eight or ten inches. On the 23d, 24th, 25th and 27th, the weather was very cold. The mercury fluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated during theſe days between 4 and 10<hi rend="sup">0</hi> above 0.</p>
            <p>IN the intervals between theſe cold days, the weather frequently moderated, ſo that the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware was frozen and thawed not leſs than four times. It was not navigable till the eighth of March. There were in all, during the winter and month of March, ſixteen diſtinct falls of ſnow.</p>
            <p>IN April and May there were a few warm days; but upon the whole, it was a very cold and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſpring. The peaches failed almoſt univerſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. There were no ſtrawberries or cherries on the 24th of May, and every other vegetable pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct was equally backward. A country woman of 84 years of age, informed me, that it was the coldeſt ſpring ſhe had ever known. It was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable to ſit without fire till the firſt of June.</p>
            <p>THE meaſles appeared firſt in the Northern Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, in December. They ſpread ſlowly in Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuary,
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:026112_0232_0FCFF2B29649FA78"/>
and were not univerſal in the city till February and March.</p>
            <p>THIS diſeaſe, like many others, had its <hi>precurſor.</hi> It was either a gum-boil, or a ſore on the tongue. They were very common, but not univerſal. They occurred in ſome inſtances, ſeveral days before the fever, but in general, they made their appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance during the eruptive fever, and were a ſure mark of the approaching eruption of the meazles. I was firſt led to obſerve this fact, from having read Dr. Quin's accurate account of the meaſles in Jamaica. I ſhall now proceed to mention the ſymptoms of the meaſles as they appeared in the different parts of the body.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IN the HEAD, they produced great pain, ſwelling of the eye-lids, ſo as to obſtruct the eye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight, tooth-ach, bleeding at the noſe, tinnitus au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rium, and deafneſs; alſo coma for two days, and convulſions. I ſaw the laſt ſymptom only in one inſtance. It was brought on by a ſtoppage of a running from the ear.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IN the THROAT and LUNGS, they produced a ſoreneſs and hoarſeneſs, acute or dull pains in the breaſt and ſides, and a painful or diſtreſſing cough. In one caſe, this cough continued for two hours without any intermiſſion, attended by copious
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:026112_0233_0FCFF2B4220E46E8"/>
expectoration. In two caſes, I ſaw a conſtant in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voluntary diſcharge of phlegm and mucus from the mouth, without any cough. One of them terminated fatally. Spitting of blood occurred in ſeveral inſtances. The ſymptoms of pneumonia vera notha and typhoides were very common. I ſaw two fatal caſes from pneumonia notha, in both of which, the patients died with the trunk of the body in an erect poſture. I met with two caſes in which there was no cough till the eruption made its appearance on the fourth day, and one which was accompanied by all the uſual ſymptoms of the cynanche trachealis humoralis.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IN the STOMACH the meaſles produced, in many inſtances, ſickneſs and vomiting. And,</p>
            <p n="4">4. IN the BOWELS, griping, diarrhoea, and in ſome inſtances, bloody ſtools. The diarrhoea oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in every ſtage of the diſorder, but it was bloody and moſt painful in its decline. I attended a black girl who diſcharged a great many worms, but without the leaſt relief of any of her ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms.</p>
            <p>THERE was a great variety in this diſeaſe—1ſt, In the <hi>time</hi> of the attack of the fever, from the <hi>time</hi> of the reception of the contagion. In gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:026112_0234_0FCF493B5C01B168"/>
the interval was fourteen days, but it frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appeared before and ſometimes later than that period.</p>
            <p n="2">2nd. IN the time of the eruption, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the fever. It generally appeared on the third and fourth days. In one caſe, Dr. Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters informed me, it did not appear till the eighth day.</p>
            <p n="3">3d. IN the abatement or continuance of the fever after the eruption.</p>
            <p n="4">4th. IN the colour and figure of the eruption. In ſome it put on a <hi>pale</hi> red, in others a <hi>deep,</hi> and in a few a <hi>livid</hi> colour, reſembling an incipient mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification. In ſome there appeared red blotches, in others an equally diffuſed redneſs, and in a few, eruptions like the ſmall pox, called by Dr. Cullen, rubiola varioloides.</p>
            <p n="5">5. IN the duration of the eruption on the ſkin. It remained in moſt caſes only three or four days; but in one, which came under my care, it remained nine days.</p>
            <p n="6">6. IN the manner of its retroceſſion. I ſaw very few caſes of its leaving the branny appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:026112_0235_0FCFF2B879D9EFC0"/>
ſo generally ſpoken of by authors on the ſkin.</p>
            <p n="7">7. IN not affecting many perſons, and even fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies who were expoſed to it.</p>
            <p>THE ſymptoms which continued in many after the retroceſſion of the meaſles, were cough,— hoarſeneſs,—or complete aphonia, which continued in two caſes for two weeks; alſo diarrhoea, op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalmy, a bad taſte in the mouth, a defect or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of appetite, and a fever, which in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances was of the intermitting kind, but which in more aſſumed the more dangerous form of the typhus mitior. I attended two caſes of internal dropſy of the brain ſoon after it. One was evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently excited by a fall. They both ended fatally.</p>
            <p>DURING the prevalence of the diſeaſe, I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved ſeveral perſons (who had had the meaſles, and who were cloſely confined to the rooms of perſons ill with them) to be affected with a ſlight cough, ſore throat, and even ſores in the mouth. I find the ſame fact taken notice of by Dr. Quier.</p>
            <p>BUT I obſerved further, many children to be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by a fever, cough, and all the other ſymptoms of the meaſles which have been mentioned, except a general eruption, for, in ſome, there was a trifling effloreſcence about the neck and breaſt. I ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:026112_0236_0FCFF2B959083018"/>
the ſame thing in 1773 and 1783. In my note book, I find the following account of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of this diſeaſe in children in the year 1773. <q>The meaſles appeared in March, a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarrh (for by that name I then called it) ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at the ſame time, and was often miſtaken for them, the ſymptoms being nearly the ſame in both. In the catarrh there was in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances a trifling eruption. A lax often attended it, and ſome who had it, had an extremely ſore mouth.</q>
            </p>
            <p>I WAS the more ſtruck with this diſeaſe, from finding it was taken notice of by Dr. Sydenham. He calls it a morbillous fever. I likewiſe find an account of it in the 2d article of the 5th volume of the Edinburgh Medical Eſſays. The words of the author who is anonymous, are as follow. <q>During this meaſley ſeaſon, ſeveral perſons, who never had the meaſles, had all the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of meaſles, which went off in a few days without any eruptions. The ſame perſons had the meaſles months or years afterwards.</q> Is this diſeaſe a common fever, marked by the reigning epidemic, and produced in the ſame manner, and by the ſame cauſes, as the variolous fever deſcribed by Dr. Sydenham, which he ſays prevailed at the
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:026112_0237_0FCFF2BAF08660E8"/>
ſame time with the ſmall pox? I think it is not. My reaſons for this opinion are as follow.</p>
            <p n="1">1. I NEVER ſaw it affect any but children, in the degree that has been mentioned, and ſuch only as had never had the meaſles.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IT affected whole families at the ſame time. It proved fatal to one of three children whom it affected on the ſame day.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IT terminated in a pulmonary conſumption in a boy of ten years old, with all the ſymptoms which attend that diſeaſe when it follows the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular meaſles.</p>
            <p n="4">4. IT affected a child in one family on the ſame day that two other members of the ſame family were affected by the genuine meaſles.</p>
            <p n="5">5. IT appeared on the uſual days of the genuine meaſles, from the time the perſons affected by it were expoſed to its contagion. And,</p>
            <p n="6">6. It communicated the diſeaſe in one family, in the uſual time in which the diſeaſe is taken from the genuine meaſles.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="239" facs="unknown:026112_0238_0FCFF2BC56811008"/>THE meaſles then appear to follow the analogy of the ſmall pox, which affects ſo ſuperficially as to be taken a ſecond time, and which produce on per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have had them what are called the nurſe pock. They follow likewiſe the analogy of another diſeaſe, viz. the ſcarlatina anginoſa. In the account of the epidemic for 1773, publiſhed in the third volume of the Edinburgh Medical Eſſays, we are told, that ſuch patients as had previouſly had the ſcarlet fever without ſore throats, took the ſore throat, and had no eruption, while thoſe who had previouſly had the ſore throat had a ſcarlet eruption, but the throat remained free from the diſtemper. All other perſons who were affected had both.</p>
            <p>FROM theſe facts, I have taken the liberty of calling it the <hi>Internal Meaſles,</hi> to diſtinguiſh it from that ſpecies which is <hi>external.</hi> I think the diſcovery of this new ſpecies of this diſorder of ſome application to practice.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT will lead us to be cautious in declaring any diſeaſe to be the external meaſles in which there is not a general eruption. From my ignorance of this, I have been led to commit ſeveral miſtakes which were diſhonourable to the profeſſion. I was called during the prevalence of the meaſles in the above-named ſeaſon, to viſit a girl of twelve
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:026112_0239_0FCFF2C21B519F30"/>
years old, with an eruption on the ſkin. I called it the meaſles. The mother told me, it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible, for that I had in 1783 attended her for the ſame diſorder. I ſuſpect the anonimous author before-mentioned has fallen into the ſame error. He adds to the account before quoted the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words. <q>Others who had undergone the meaſles formerly, had at <hi>this time,</hi> a fever of the eriſipelatous kind, with eruptions like to which nettles cauſe, and all the <hi>previous</hi> and concomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant ſymptoms of the meaſles from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to the end of the diſeaſe.</q>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. IF inoculation, or any other mode of leſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the violence of the diſeaſe ſhould be adopted, it will be of conſequence to know what perſons are ſecure from the attacks of it, and who are ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to it.</p>
            <p>I SHALL now add a ſhort account of my method of treating this diſorder.</p>
            <p>MANY hundred families came through the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe without the help of a phyſician. But in many caſes it was attended with peculiar danger, and in ſome with death. I think it was much more fatal than in the years 1773 and 1783, probably owing to the variable weather in the winter, and the coldneſs and dampneſs of the ſucceeding ſpring. Dr. Huxham ſays, he once ſaw the meaſles attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:026112_0240_0FCFF2C40C562460"/>
with peculiar mortality, during a late cold and damp ſpring in England. It was much more fatal (caeteris paribus) to adults than to young people.</p>
            <p>THE remedies I uſed were,</p>
            <p n="1">1. BLEEDING, in all caſes where great pain and cough with a hard pulſe attended. In ſome I found it neceſſary to repeat this remedy. But I met with many caſes in which it was forbidden by the weakneſs of the pulſe, and by other marks of great debility.</p>
            <p n="2">2. VOMITS. Theſe were very uſeful in remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a nauſea; they likewiſe favoured the eruption of the meaſles.</p>
            <p n="3">3. DEMULCENT and DILUTING drinks. Theſe were barley water, bran, and flaxſeed tea, dried cherry and raw apple water, alſo beverage, and cyder and water. The laſt drink I found to be the moſt agreeable to my patients of any that have been mentioned.</p>
            <p n="4">4. BLISTERS to the neck, ſides, and extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, according to the ſymptoms. They were uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in every ſtage of the diſorder.</p>
            <p n="5">
               <pb n="242" facs="unknown:026112_0241_0FCFF2C6D4D9A968"/>5. OPIATES. Theſe were given not only at night, but in ſmall doſes during the day, when a troubleſome cough or diarrhoea attended.</p>
            <p n="6">6. WHERE a catarrhal fever enſued, I uſed bleeding and bliſters. In thoſe caſes in which this fever terminated in an intermittent, or in a typhus, I gave the bark with evident advantage. In that caſe of meaſles, formerly mentioned, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by ſymptoms of cynanche trachialis hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moralis, I gave calomel with the happieſt effects. In the admiſſion of <hi>freſh air</hi> I obſerved a medium as to its temperature, and accommodated it to the degrees of action in the ſyſtem. In different parts of the country, in Pennſylvania and New-Jerſey, I heard with great pleaſure of the <hi>cold air</hi> being uſed as freely and as ſucceſsfully in this diſorder as in the inflammatory ſmall pox. The ſame people who were ſo much benefited by <hi>cool air,</hi> I was informed, drank plentfully of cold water during every ſtage of the diſorder. One thing in favor of this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try practice deſerves to be mentioned, and that is, evident advantage aroſe in all the caſes which I at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, from patients leaving their beds in the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brile ſtate of this diſeaſe. But this was practiſed only by thoſe in whom inflammatory diatheſis prevailed, for theſe alone had ſtrength enough to bear it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="243" facs="unknown:026112_0242_0FCFF2D05B3E5998"/>THE convaleſcent ſtate of this diſeaſe required particular attention.</p>
            <p n="1">1. A DIARRHAEA often continued to be trouble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome after other ſymptoms had abated. I relieved it by opiates and demulcent drinks. Bleeding has been recommended for it, but I did not find it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary in a ſingle caſe.</p>
            <p n="2">2. AN OPTHALMIA which ſometimes attended, yielded to aſtringent collyria and bliſters.</p>
            <p n="3">3. WHERE a cough or fever followed ſo ſlight as not to require bleeding, I adviſed a milk and vegetable diet, country air, and moderate warmth; for whatever might have been the relation of the lungs in the beginning of the diſeaſe to cold air, they were now evidently too much debilitated to bear it.</p>
            <p n="4">4. IT is a common practiſe to preſcribe purges after the meaſles. After the aſthenic ſtate of this diſorder they certainly do harm. In all caſes, the effects of them may be better obviated by diet, full or low, ſuitable clothing, and gentle exerciſe, or country air. I omitted them in ſeveral caſes, and no eruption or diſeaſe of any kind fallowed their diſuſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="244" facs="unknown:026112_0243_0FCFF2D2DE6766C8"/>I SHALL only add to this account of the meaſles, that in ſeveral families, I ſaw evident advantages from preparing the body for the reception of the contagion, by means of a vegetable diet.</p>

            <p>THE latter end of the month of Auguſt in the ſummer of 1789, was ſo very cool that fires became agreeable. The month of September was cool, dry, and pleaſant. During the whole of this month, and for ſome days before it began, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter it ended, there had been no rain. In the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of October, a number of the members of the
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:026112_0246_0FCFF2DA4F1469A0"/>
firſt Congreſs, that had aſſembled in New-York, under the preſent national government, arrived in Philadelphia, much indiſpoſed with colds. They aſcribed them to the fatigue and night air to which they had been expoſed in travelling in the public ſtages; but from the number of perſons who were affected, from the uniformity of their complaints, and from the rapidity with which it was propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted through our city, it ſoon became evident that it was the diſeaſe ſo well known of late years, by the name of the Influenza.</p>
            <p>THE ſymptoms which uſhered in the diſeaſe, were generally a hoarſeneſs, ſore-throat, a ſenſe of wearineſs, chills, and a fever. After the diſeaſe was formed, it affected more or leſs the following parts of the body. Many complained of acute pains in the HEAD. Theſe pains were frequently fixed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the eye-balls, and in three caſes which came under my notice, they were terminated by abſceſſes in the frontal ſinus, which diſcharged themſelves through the noſe. The pain, in one of theſe ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, before the rupture of the abſceſs, was ſo exquiſite, that my patient informed me, that he felt as if he ſhould loſe his reaſon. Many com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of a great itching in the EYE-LIDS. In ſome, the eye-lids were ſwelled. In others, a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious effuſion of water took place from the EYES;
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:026112_0247_0FCF494159DD3B28"/>
and in a few, there was a true ophthalmia. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny complained of great pains in one EAR, and ſome of pains in both EARS. In ſome theſe pains termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated in abſceſſes, which diſcharged for ſome days a bloody or purulent matter. In others, there was a ſwelling behind each ear without a ſuppuration. SNEEZING was an univerſal ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom. In ſome it occurred not leſs than fifty times in a day. The matter diſcharged from the noſe, was ſo acrid as to inflame the noſtrils, and the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per-lip, in ſuch a manner as to bring on ſwellings, ſores, and ſcabs in many people. In ſome, the noſe diſcharged drops, and in a few, ſtreams of blood, to the amount, in one caſe, of twenty oun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. In many caſes, it was ſo much obſtructed, as to render breathing through it difficult. In ſome there was a total defect of TASTE. In others there was a bad taſte in the mouth, which fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently continued through the whole courſe of the diſeaſe. In ſome there was a want of APPE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TITE. In others it was perfectly natural. Some complained of a ſoreneſs in their mouths, as if they had been inflamed by holding pepper in them. Some had SWELLED JAWS, and many complained of the TOOTH-ACH. I ſaw only one caſe in which the diſeaſe produced a COMA.</p>

               <pb n="250" facs="unknown:026112_0248_0FCFF2E190581118"/>MANY were affected with pains in the BREAST and SIDES. A difficulty of breathing attended in ſome, and a COUGH was univerſal. Sometimes this cough alternated with a pain in the head. Sometimes it preceded this pain, and ſometimes it followed it. It was at all times diſtreſſing. In ſome inſtances it reſembled the chin cough. One perſon expired in a fit of coughing, and many perſons ſpat blood in conſequence of its violence. I ſaw ſeveral patients in whom the diſeaſe affected the trachea chiefly, producing great difficulty of breathing, and, in one caſe, a ſuppreſſion of the voice, and I heard of one caſe in which the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, by falling on the trachea, produced a cynan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>che trachealis. In moſt of the caſes which termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated fatally, the patients died of pneumonia no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tha.</p>
            <p>THE STOMACH was ſometimes affected by nau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſea, and vomiting; but this was far from being an univerſal ſymptom.</p>
            <p>I MET with four caſes in which the whole force of the diſeaſe fell upon the BOWELS and went off in a diarrhoea; but in general the bowels were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular or coſtive.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="251" facs="unknown:026112_0249_0FCFF2E4776E1810"/>THE LIMBS were affected with ſuch acute pains as to be miſtaken for the rheumatiſm, or for the break-bone-fever of 1780. The pains were moſt acute in the back and thighs.</p>
            <p>PROFUSE SWEATS appeared in many over the whole body in the beginning, but without afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any relief. It was in ſome inſtances accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by eryſipelatous, and in four caſes which came to my knowledge, it was followed by miliary erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>THE pulſe was ſometimes tenſe, and quick, but ſeldom full. In a great majority of thoſe whom I viſited it was quick, weak, and ſoft.</p>
            <p>THERE was no appearance in the urine differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from what is common in all fevers.</p>
            <p>THE diſeaſe had evident remiſſions, and the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſeldom continued above three or four days; but the cough, and ſome other troubleſome ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, ſometimes continued two or three weeks.</p>
            <p>IN a few perſons, the fever terminated in a te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious and dangerous typhus.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="252" facs="unknown:026112_0250_0FCFF2E630B30A80"/>IN ſeveral pregnant women it produced uterine haemorrhages and abortions.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is remarkable that abortions are produced chiefly by contagious fevers, ſuch as the plague, the ſmall-pox, and the meaſles, while inflammatory and bilious fevers, and even the dyſentery which frequently agitate the female ſyſtem more violently, ſeldom induce thoſe effects.</note>
            </p>
            <p>IT affected adults of both ſexes alike. A few old people eſcaped it. It paſſed by children un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der eight years old with a few exceptions. Out of five and thirty maniacs in the Pennſylvania hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, only three were affected by it. No profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion or occupation eſcaped it. The ſmell of tar and tobacco did not preſerve the perſons who worked in them from the contagion—nor did the uſe of tobacco, in ſnuff, ſmoking, or chewing af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford a ſecurity againſt it.<note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. Howard informs us that the uſe of tobacco is not a preſervative againſt the plague as has formerly been ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; of courſe that apology for the uſe of an offenſive weed ſhould not be admitted.</note>
            </p>
            <p>EVEN previous and exiſting diſeaſes did not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect patients from it. It inſinuated into ſick cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and blended itſelf with every ſpecies of chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic complaint.</p>
            <p>IT was remarkable that perſons who worked in
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:026112_0251_0FCFF2E7102FAD40"/>
the open air, ſuch as ſailors, and long-ſhore-men (to uſe a mercantile epithet) had it much worſe than tradeſmen who worked within doors. A body of ſurveyors in the eaſtern woods of Pennſylvania, who caught it all at once from one of their attendants, ſuffered extremely from it. Even the vigor of conſtitution, which is imparted by the ſavage life, did not mitigate its violence. Mr. Andrew Ellicot, the geographer of the United States, informed me that he was a witneſs of its affecting the Indians in the neighbourhood of Niagara with peculiar force. The cough which attended this diſorder, was ſo new and ſo irritating a complaint among them, that they aſcribed it to witchcraft.</p>
            <p>IT proved moſt fatal on the ſea-ſhore of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States.</p>
            <p>MANY people who had recovered, were affected a ſecond time with all the ſymptoms of the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. I ſhould have aſcribed this ſecond attack to the ſenſible qualities of the atmoſphere, had I not obſerved it to affect thoſe perſons chiefly who had occaſionally changed their place of reſidence du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the prevalence of the diſorder. I met with a woman, who after recovering from it in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, took it a ſecond time in New-York, and a third time upon her return to Philadelphia.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="254" facs="unknown:026112_0252_0FCFF2EA2D7A3640"/>MANY thouſand people had the diſorder who were not confined to their houſes, but tranſacted buſineſs as uſual out of doors.—A perpetual coughing was heard in every ſtreet of the city.— Buying and ſelling were rendered tedious by the coughing of the farmer and the citizen who met in market places. It even rendered divine ſervice ſcarcely intelligible in the churches.</p>
            <p>A FEW perſons who were expoſed to the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion eſcaped it, and ſome had it ſo lightly as ſcarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to be ſenſible of it. Of the perſons who were confined to their houſes, not a fourth part of them kept their beds.</p>
            <p>IT proved fatal (with few exceptions) only to old people, and to perſons who had been previouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly debilitated by conſumptive complaints. It like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe carried off ſeveral hard drinkers. It termina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in aſthma in three perſons whoſe caſes came un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der my notice, and in pulmonary conſumption, in many more. I met with an inſtance in a lady, who was much relieved of a chronic complaint in her liver; and I heard of another inſtance of a clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man whoſe general health was much improved by a ſevere attack of this diſorder.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="255" facs="unknown:026112_0253_0FCFF2EB9D726FD8"/>THE contagion was not wholly confined to the human ſpecies. It affected two cats, two houſe-dogs, and one horſe within the ſphere of my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations. One of the dogs diſturbed his miſtreſs ſo much by coughing at night, that ſhe gave him ten drops of laudanum for ſeveral nights, which perfectly compoſed him. One of the cats had a vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting with her cough. The horſe breathed as if he had been affected by the cynanche trachialis.</p>
            <p>THE ſcarlatina anginoſa, which prevailed during the ſummer, diſappeared after the firſt of October; but appeared again after the influenza left the city. Nor was the remitting fever ſeen during the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of the reigning epidemic.</p>
            <p>I INOCULATED about twenty children for the ſmall-pox during this prevalence of the Influenza, and never ſaw that diſeaſe exhibit a more favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able appearance.</p>
            <p>IN the treatment of the Influenza I was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by the ſtate of the ſyſtem. Where inflammatory diatheſis diſcovered itſelf by a full or tenſe pulſe, or where great difficulty of breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occurred, and the pulſe was low and weak in the beginning of the diſorder, I ordered moderate bleeding. In a few caſes in which the ſymptoms
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:026112_0254_0FCFF2EE946340E8"/>
of pneumony attended, I bled a ſecond time with advantage. In all theſe inſtances of inflammatory affection I gave the uſual antiphlogiſtic medicines. I found that vomits did not terminate the diſorder, as they often do a common catarrh, in the courſe of a day, or of a few hours.</p>
            <p>IN caſes where no inflammatory action appeared in the ſyſtem, I preſcribed cordial drinks and diet, and forbad every kind of evacuation. I ſaw ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral inſtances of perſons who had languiſhed for a week or two with the diſorder, who were ſuddenly cured by eating a hearty meal, or by drinking half a pint of wine, or a pint of warm punch. In all theſe caſes of debility, liquid laudanum gave great relief, not only by ſuſpending the cough, but by eaſing the pains in the bones.</p>
            <p>I MET with a caſe of an old lady who was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly and perfectly cured of her cough by a fright.</p>
            <p>THE duration of the diſorder in our city was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſix weeks—It ſpread from New-York and Philadelphia in all directions, and in the courſe of a few months pervaded every ſtate in the union. It was carried from the United States to ſeveral of the Weſt India iſlands. It prevailed in the iſland
<pb n="257" facs="unknown:026112_0255_0FCFF2F03615DEF8"/>
of Grenada in the month of November 1789, and it was heard of in the courſe of the enſuing winter in the Spaniſh ſettlements in South America.</p>
            <p>THE following winter was unuſually mild, inſomuch that the navigation of the Delaware was not interrupted during the whole ſeaſon, only from the 7th to the 24th of February. The wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the 3d and 4th days of March was very cold, and on the 8th and 9th days of the ſame month, the mercury in Fahrenheit's thermometer ſtood at 4° at 7 o'clock in the morning. On the 10th and 11th, there fell a deep ſnow. The wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther during the remaining part of the month was cold, rainy, and variable. It continued to be vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able during the month of April. About the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the month, there fell an unuſual quantity of rain. The ſhowers which fell on the night of the 17th, will long be connected in the memories of the citizens of Philadelphia with the time of the death of the celebrated Dr. Franklin. Several pleu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſies appeared during this month; alſo a few ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of meaſles. In the laſt week of the month, the influenza made its appearance. It was brought to the city from New-England, and affected, in its courſe, all the intermediate ſtates. Its ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms were nearly the ſame as they were in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding autumn, but in many people it put on ſome
<pb n="258" facs="unknown:026112_0256_0FCFF2F1B1C48A20"/>
new appearances. Several perſons who were af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by it, had ſymptoms of madneſs, one of whom deſtroyed himſelf by jumping out of a win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. Some had no cough, but very acute pains in the back and head. It was remarked that thoſe who had the diſeaſe chiefly in the breaſt the laſt year, complained now chiefly of their heads, while thoſe whoſe heads were affected formerly, now complained chiefly of their breaſts. In many, it put on the type of an intermitting fever. Several complained of conſtant chills, or conſtant ſweats; and ſome were much alarmed by an uncommon blue and dark colour in their hands. I ſaw one caſe of iſchuria, another of an acute pain in the rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum, a third of anaſarca, and a fourth of a palſy in the tongue and arms; all of which appeared to be anomalous ſymptoms of the Influenza. Sneezing, and pains in the ears and frontal ſinus, were leſs common now than they were in the fall; but a pain in the eye-balls was an univerſal ſymptom. Some had a pain in the one eye only, and a few had ſore eyes, and ſwellings in the face. Many women who had it, were affected by an irregular appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the catamenia. In two perſons whom I ſaw, the cough was inceſſant for three days, nor could it be compoſed by any other remedy than plentiful bleeding. A patient of Dr. Samuel Duf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field's informed me after his recovery, that he had
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:026112_0257_0FCFF2F325A9F7C0"/>
had no other ſymptom of the diſeaſe than an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>floreſcence on his ſkin, and a large ſwelling in his groin, which terminated in a tedious abſceſs.</p>
            <p>THE priſoners in the goal who had it in the autumn, eſcaped it this ſpring.</p>
            <p>DURING the prevalence of this diſorder, I ſaw no ſign of any other epidemic.</p>
            <p>IT declined ſenſibly about the firſt week in June, and after the 12th day of this month, I was not called to a ſingle patient in this diſorder.</p>
            <p>THE remedies for it were the ſame as were uſed in the fall.</p>
            <p>I USED bleeding in ſeveral caſes on the ſecond, third, and fourth days of the diſorder, where it had appeared to be improper in its firſt ſtage. The caſes which required bleeding were far from being general. I ſaw two inſtances of ſyncope of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larming nature, after the loſs of ten ounces of blood; and I heard of one inſtance of a boy who died in half an hour after this evacuation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="260" facs="unknown:026112_0258_0FCFF2F495354E58"/>I REMARKED that purges of all kinds worked more violently than uſual in this diſorder.</p>
            <p>THE convaleſcence from it was very ſlow, and a general languor appeared to pervade the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens for ſeveral weeks after it left the city.</p>
            <p>THE month of December 1790 was extremely and uniformly cold. In the beginning of the month of January 1791, the weather moderated, and continued to be pleaſant, till the 17th, on which day the navigation of the Delaware, which had been completely obſtructed by the ice, was opened ſo as to admit of the arrival of ſeveral veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels. During the month of December many peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple complained of <hi>Colds</hi>; but they were aſcribed wholly to the weather. In January four or five perſons in a family were affected by colds at the ſame time; which created a ſuſpicion of a return of the influenza. This ſuſpicion was ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by accounts of its prevailing in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring counties of Cheſter and Montgomery in Pennſylvania, and in the diſtant ſtates of Virginia and Rhode-Iſland. It did not affect near ſo gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally as in the two former times of appearance. There was no difference in the method of treating it. While the common inflammatory diſeaſes of the winter, bore the lancet as uſual, it was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:026112_0259_0FCFF2F647896D98"/>
that patients who were attacked by the influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za, did not bear bleeding in a greater proportion, or in a larger quantity than in the two former times of its appearance in the city.</p>
            <p>I SHALL conclude this account of the Influenza by the following obſervations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IT is as certainly a contagious diſeaſe as the meaſles or ſmall pox, and exiſts independently of the ſenſible qualities of the air. This is proved by its prevailing in every ſpecies of weather, and in ſucceſſive periods in neighbourhoods, which have been expoſed in the ſame inſtant to the ſame atmoſphere; alſo by whole families, and the tenants of gaols and hoſpitals frequently eſcaping it. It is not peculiar to the influenza not to be affected by the different ſtates of the weather. Dr. Patrick Ruſſel has proved, that the contagion of the plague is equally independent of the influence of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſphere.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE Influenza infects at the greateſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, paſſes with the utmoſt rapidity through a country, and affects the greateſt number of people in a given time, of any contagious diſeaſe in the world.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="262" facs="unknown:026112_0260_0FCFF2F7952E12C8"/>3. IT appears from the hiſtories of it which are upon record, that neither climate, nor the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſtates of ſociety, have produced any <hi>material</hi> change in the diſorder. This will appear from comparing the account I have given, with the hiſtories of it which have lately been given by Dr. Grey, Dr. Hamilton, Dr. A. Fothergill, Mr. Chiſholm, and other modern phyſicians. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears further, that even time itſelf has not been able materially to change the type of this diſorder. This is evident, from comparing modern accounts of it with thoſe which have been handed down to us by ancient phyſicians.</p>
            <p>I HAVE hinted in a former eſſay at the <hi>diminu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives</hi> of certain diſeaſes. There is a ſpecies of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenza, which is leſs violent and more local, than that which has been deſcribed. It generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vails in the winter ſeaſon. It ſeems to originate from a morbid matter, generated in crowded and heated churches, and other aſſemblies of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. I have ſeen a cold, or influenza, frequently univerſal in Philadelphia, which I have diſtinctly traced to this ſource. It would ſeem as if the ſame ſpecies of diſeaſes reſembled pictures, and that while ſome of them partook of the deep and vivid nature of moſaic work, others appeared like the feeble and tranſient impreſſions of water colours.</p>

            <head>AN INQUIRY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT has been remarked, that Pennſylvania for ſome years paſt, has become more ſickly than formerly. Fevers, which a few years ago appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed chiefly on the banks of creeks and rivers, and in the neighborhood of mill-ponds, now appear in parts remote from them all, and in the higheſt ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuations. This change with reſpect to the heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of our country, may be traced to the three following cauſes.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE eſtabliſhment and increaſe of mill-ponds. There are whole counties in Pennſylvania in which
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:026112_0263_0FCFF2FE5CA7A9B0"/>
intermittents were unknown, until the waters in them were dammed, for the purpoſe of erecting mill-ponds.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE cutting down of wood, under certain circumſtances, tends to render a country ſickly. It has been remarked, that intermittents on the ſhores of the Suſquehannah, have kept an exact pace with the paſſages which have been opened for the propagation of marſh effluvia, by cutting down the wood which formerly grew in its neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. I remember the time, when intermittents were known only within half a mile, in ſome pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, of that river. They are now to be met with ten miles from it, in the ſame parts of the ſtate.</p>
            <p>I BEG a diſtinction to be made here between <hi>clearing</hi> and <hi>cultivating</hi> a country. While clearing a country makes it ſickly, in the manner that has been mentioned, <hi>cultivating</hi> a country, that is, draining ſwamps, deſtroying weeds, burning bruſh, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haling the unwholſome and ſuperfluous moiſture of the earth, by means of frequent crops of grain, graſſes, and vegetables of all kinds, render it heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy. I could mention, in ſupport of theſe facts, ſeveral countries in the United States, which have paſſed through each of the ſtages that have been deſcribed. The firſt ſettlers received theſe coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:026112_0264_0FCFF30394C1B880"/>
from the hands of nature pure and healthy.<note n="*" place="bottom">A Phyſician who travelled through part of Bedford county, in Pennſylvania, in the year 1782, informed me that he was witneſs of ſome country people having travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led twenty miles, to ſee whether it was poſſible for a Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man girl, who laboured under an intermittent, to be HOT and COLD at the ſame time. Even the ſwamps in the Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted States are healthy before they are cleared. In the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware State, labourers paſs whole ſummers and autumns in making ſhingles in the cedar ſwamps, without being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by fevers or ſickneſs of any kind. Perſons who ſpend the warm months in the cedar and pine ſwamps in North-Carolina, are likewiſe equally free from diſeaſes.</note> Fevers ſoon followed their improvements, nor were they finally baniſhed, until the higher degrees of cultivation that have been named took place. I confine myſelf to thoſe countries only where the ſalutary effects of cultivation were not rendered abortive by the neighbourhood of mill-ponds.</p>
            <p>A third cauſe of the late increaſe of bilious and intermitting fevers, muſt be ſought for in the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and unequal quantities of rain which have fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en within theſe laſt ſeven years. While our creeks and rivers, from the uniformity of our ſeaſons, were confined to ſteady bounds, there was little or no exhalation of febrile miaſmata from their ſhores. But the dry ſummers of 1780, 1781,
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:026112_0265_0FCFF306EE2589A0"/>
and 1782, by reducing our creeks and rivers far below their ancient marks; while the wet ſprings of 1784 and 1785, by ſwelling them both beyond their natural heights, have, when they have fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, as in the former caſe, left a large and extenſive ſurface of moiſt ground expoſed to the action of the ſun, and of courſe to the generation and exha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of febrile miaſmata. The hiſtory of epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mics in foreign countries, favours this opinion of the cauſe of their increaſe in Pennſylvania. The inhabitants of Egypt are always healthy during the overflowing of the Nile. Their fevers appear only after the receſs of the river. It is remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able that a wet ſeaſon is often healthy in low, while it is ſickly in hilly countries. The reaſon is obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. In the former the rains entirely cover all the moiſt grounds, while in the latter, they fall only in ſufficient quantity to produce thoſe degrees of moiſture which favour febrile exhalations. The rains which fall in the ſummer are rendered harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs only by covering the <hi>whole</hi> ſurface of marſhy ground. The rains which fall in our ſtate after the middle of September, are ſo far from produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing fevers, that they generally prevent them. The extraordinary healthineſs of the laſt autumn, I believe, was occaſioned by nothing but the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary quantity of rain that fell during the autumnal months. The rain probably acts at this
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:026112_0266_0FCFF30ABA89AFF0"/>
ſeaſon by diluting, and thus deſtroying, the febrile miaſmata that were produced by the heat and moi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſture of the preceding ſummer. In ſupport of the truth of this third cauſe of the increaſe of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers in Pennſylvania, I have only to add a fact lately communicated to me by Dr. Franklin. He informed me, that in his journey from Paſſey to Havre de Grace, laſt ſummer, he found the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try through which he travelled, unuſually ſickly with fevers. Theſe fevers, it was generally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, were produced by the extrordinary dry weather, of which the public papers have given us ſuch melancholy and frequent accounts.</p>
            <p>I COME now to ſuggeſt a few hints for obviating and preventing fevers, and for rendering our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try again healthy. For this purpoſe, I beg leave to recommend, in the firſt place, the planting of trees around all our mill ponds, (beſides cleaning them occaſionally) in order to prevent the diſeaſes that have juſtly been aſcribed to them. Let the trees be planted in the greateſt number, and cloſeſt together, to leeward of the ordinary current of the ſummer and autumnal winds. I have known ſeveral inſtances of families being preſerved from fevers by an accidental copſe of wood ſtanding between a mill-pond and a dwelling-houſe, and that in caſes too where the houſe deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved

no advantage from an high ſituation. The trees <hi>around</hi> or <hi>near</hi> a mill-pond, act perhaps in a ſmall degree <hi>mechanically.</hi> By ſheltering the pond from the action of the ſun, they leſſen exhalation, as well as obſtruct the paſſage of the vapors that are raiſed, to the adjacent parts. But they act likewiſe <hi>chemically.</hi> It has been demonſtrated that trees abſorb unhealthy air, and diſcharge it in a highly purified ſtate in the form of what is now called "dephlogiſticated" air. The willow tree, according to Mr. Ingenhauzs, has been found to purify air the moſt rapidly of any tree that he has ſubjected to his experiments. The ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity of its growth, its early verdure, and the late fall of its leaf, all ſeem to mark it likewiſe as a tree highly proper for this purpoſe.</p>
            <p>A SECOND method of preventing fevers, is to let the cultivation always keep pace with the <hi>clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> of our lands. Nature has in this inſtance, connected our duty, intereſt, and health together. Let every ſpot covered with moiſture from which the wood has been cut, be carefully drained, and afterwards ploughed and ſowed with graſs ſeed; let weeds of all kinds be deſtroyed, and let the waters be ſo directed as to prevent their ſtagnating in any part of their courſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="271" facs="unknown:026112_0268_0FCFF30E2AC3FF80"/>THESE are the two principal means of extirpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting intermitting and bilious fevers from our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, but as theſe means are ſlow in their operation, I ſhall ſubjoin a few directions for preventing fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers till the above remedies can take effect.</p>
            <p n="1">1. WHETHER the matter which produces fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers be of an organic nature, I do not pretend to determine, but it is certain, that <hi>fire,</hi> or the <hi>ſmoke</hi> or <hi>heat</hi> which iſſue from it, deſtroy the effects of marſh miaſmata upon the human body; hence we find cities more healthy than country places, and the centre of cities more healthy than their ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urbs in the ſickly months. To derive the utmoſt poſſible benefit from this method of preventing ſickneſs, I would adviſe large fires to be made every evening, of bruſh, between the ſpots from whence the exhalations are derived, and the dwelling houſe, and as near to the latter as is ſafe, and not diſagreeable. This practice ſhould be continued till the appearance of two or three froſts, for froſts, as well as heavy rains in the autumnal months, ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver fail to put a ſtop to the progreſs of intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents.</p>
            <p>DURING the ſickly ſeaſon, fires ſhould be like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe kept in every room in the dwelling houſe, even in thoſe caſes where the heat of the weather
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:026112_0269_0FCFF312C96CF2D8"/>
makes it neceſſary to keep the doors and windows open.</p>
            <p n="2">2. LET me adviſe my countrymen in ſickly ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, to prefer woollen and cotton to linen clothes in the ſummer and autumnal months. The moſt ſickly parts of the iſland of Jamaica have been ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered more healthy, ſince the inhabitants have adopted the uſe of woollen and cotton garments inſtead of linen.</p>
            <p>DURING the late war, I knew many officers, both in the Britiſh and American armies, who eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped fevers in the moſt ſickly places, by wearing woollen ſhirts or waiſtcoats conſtantly next to their ſkins. I have heard the preſent diminution of the human body in ſtrength and ſize, compared with its ancient vigor and form, aſcribed in part to the introduction of linen garments. I am not diſpoſed to controvert this opinion, but I am ſure of the efficacy of woollen clothes in wet and cold climates in preventing fevers of all kinds. The parliament of Great Britain compels every body that dies within the iſland to be buried in a woollen ſhirt or winding ſheet. The law would be much wiſer if it compelled every body to wear woollen garments next to their ſkins during life, and linen after death.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="273" facs="unknown:026112_0270_0FCFF318C4B5DF20"/>3. THE diet in the ſickly months ſhould be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous. Wine and beer ſhould be the drinks of this ſeaſon inſtead of ſpirits and water. I do not think that fruit and vegetables of any kind produce fevers, but as the ſeaſon of the year produces lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guor and weakneſs, a larger quantity of animal food than uſual is beſt calculated to oppoſe them. Salt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed meat, for this reaſon, is preferable to freſh meat. Food of all kinds eaten during the ſickly months, ſhould be well ſeaſoned.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE evening air ſhould be avoided as much as poſſible. Even the morning air before the ſun riſes, ſhould not be breathed, until the body has been fortified with a little ſolid aliment, or a <hi>draught</hi> of bitters. Theſe bitters ſhould be made of centaury, wormwood, camomile, or the bark of the willow or dogwood trees infuſed in <hi>water.</hi> Bit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters made with ſpirits, or even wine, cannot be taken in a ſufficient quantity to do ſervice without producing intoxication, or the deadly habit of lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and drinking ſpirituous liquors.</p>
            <p n="5">5. TOO much cannot be ſaid in favour of clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, as means of preventing fevers. The body ſhould be bathed or waſhed frequently. It has been proved in the highlands of Jamaica, that add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſalt to water, renders it more powerful in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting
<pb n="274" facs="unknown:026112_0271_0FCFF31B3AB6FD98"/>
diſeaſes when applied to the body. Equal pains ſhould be taken to promote cleanlineſs in every ſpecies of apparel. Offal matters, eſpecially thoſe which are of a vegetable nature, ſhould be removed from the neighbourhood of a dwelling houſe. The dung of domeſtic animals, during its progreſs towards manure may be excepted from this direction. Nature, which made man and theſe animals equally neceſſary to each others ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence, has kindly prevented any inconvenience from their living together. On the contrary, to repay the huſbandman for affording a ſhelter to theſe uſeful and helpleſs animals, nature has done more. She has endowed their dung with a power of deſtroying the effects of marſh exhalations, and of preventing fevers. The miſerable cottagers in Europe who live under the ſame roof, and in ſome inſtances in the ſame room with their cattle, are always healthy. In Philadelphia, fevers are leſs known in the neighbourhood of livery ſtables, than in any other part of the city. I could mention a family that has lived near thirty years near a livery ſtable in a ſickly part of the city, that has never known a fever but from the meaſles or ſmall-pox.</p>

            <head>AN INQUIRY, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>HOWEVER trifling theſe complaints may appear, they compoſe a large claſs of the diſeaſes of a numerous body of people. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto the perſons afflicted by them have been too generally abandoned to the care of empirics, either becauſe the diſeaſe was conſidered as beneath the notice of phyſicians, or becauſe they were unable to cure it. I would rather aſcribe it to the latter, than to the former cauſe, for pride has no natural fellowſhip with the profeſſion of medicine.</p>
            <p>THE difficulty of curing ſore legs has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed by phyſicians in every country. As far as my obſervations have extended, I am diſpoſed to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe this difficulty to the uniform and indiſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:026112_0274_0FCFF32026315BE8"/>
mode of treating them, occaſioned by the want of a theory which ſhall explain their proxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate cauſe. I ſhall attempt in a few pages to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver one, which however imperfect, will I hope lay a foundation for more ſucceſsful inquiries upon this ſubject hereafter.</p>
            <p>I SHALL begin my obſervations upon this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order, by delivering and ſupporting the following propoſitions.</p>
            <p n="1">I. SORE LEGS are a diſeaſe of general debility, which, for the moſt part, is of the indirect kind. This I infer from the occupations and habits of the perſons who are moſt ſubject to them. They are day-labourers, and ſailors, who are in the habit of lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing great weights; alſo waſher-women, and all other perſons, who paſs the greateſt part of their time upon their feet. The blood veſſels, and muſcular fibres of the legs are thus overſtretched, by which means either a rupture, or ſuch a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid action in the veſſels is induced, as that an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidental wound from any cauſe, even from the ſcratch of a pin or the bite of a moſquito, will not eaſily heal. But labourers, ſailors, and waſher-women, are not the only perſons who are afflicted with ſore legs. Hard-drinkers of every rank and deſcription are likewiſe ſubject to them. Where
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:026112_0275_0FCFF32329322868"/>
ſtrong drink, labour, and ſtanding long on the feet are united, they more certainly diſpoſe to ſore legs, than when they act ſeparately. In China, where the labour which is performed by brutes in other countries is performed by men, varices on the legs are very common among the labouring people. Perhaps, the reaſon why the debility induced in the legs produces varices inſtead of ulcers in theſe people, may be owing to their not adding the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilitating ſtimulus of ſtrong drink to that of exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive labour.</p>
            <p>IT is not extraordinary that the indirect debi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity produced by intemperance in drinking ardent ſpirits, ſhould appear firſt in the lower extremities. The indirect debility produced by intemperance in the uſe of wine, makes its firſt appearance in the form of gout, in the ſame part of the body. The gout, it is true, diſcovers itſelf moſt frequently in pain only, but there are caſes in which it has terminated in ulcers, and even mortifications on the legs.</p>
            <p n="2">II. SORE LEGS are a diſeaſe of the whole ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtem. This I infer,</p>
            <p n="1">1. From the cauſes which induce them, all of
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:026112_0276_0FCFF3249E09E160"/>
which act more or leſs upon every part of the body.</p>
            <p n="2">2. FROM their following or preceding diſeaſes which obviouſly belong to the whole ſyſtem. Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers and dyſenteries often terminate critically in this diſorder; and the pulmonary conſumption and apoplexy have often been preceded by the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of an habitual diſcharge from a ſore leg. The two latter diſeaſes have been aſcribed to the tranſlation of a morbific matter to the lungs or brain: But it is more rational to aſcribe them to a previous debility in thoſe organs, by which means their veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels were more eaſily excited into action and effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the ſtimulus of the plethora, induced upon the ſyſtem in conſequence of the confinement of the fluids formerly diſcharged from the leg in the form of pus. This plethora can do harm only where there is previous debility; for I maintain that the ſyſtem (when the ſolids are exactly toned) will always relieve itſelf of a ſudden preternatural accumulation of fluids by means of ſome natural emunctory. This has been often obſerved in the menorrhagia, which accompanies plentiful living in women, and in the copious diſcharges from the bowels and kidneys which follow a ſuppreſſion of the perſpiration.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="281" facs="unknown:026112_0277_0FCFF3261F53AF10"/>3. I INFER it, from their appearing almoſt uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally in one diſeaſe, which is evidently a diſeaſe of the whole ſyſtem, viz. the ſcurvy.</p>
            <p n="4">4. FROM their becoming in ſome caſes the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets of menſtrual blood, which is diſcharged in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of a plethora which affects more or leſs every part of the female ſyſtem.</p>
            <p n="5">5. I INFER it from the <hi>ſymptoms</hi> of ſore legs, which are in ſome caſes febrile, and affect the pulſe in every part of the body with preternatural fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quency or force. Theſe ſymptoms were witneſſed, in an eminent degree, in two of the patients who furniſhed ſubjects for clinical remarks in the Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania hoſpital in the courſe of the laſt winter.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I INFER that ſore legs are a diſeaſe of the whole ſyſtem, from the manner in which they are ſometimes cured by nature and art. They often prove the outlets of many general diſeaſes, and all the remedies which cure them, act more or leſs up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the whole ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>IN all caſes of ſore legs there is a tonic and atonic ſtate of the whole ſyſtem. The ſame ſtate of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive or deficient action takes place in the parts
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:026112_0278_0FCF4946D1CAFE20"/>
which are affected by the ſores. The remedies to cure them, therefore, ſhould be <hi>general</hi> and <hi>local.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN caſes where the arterial ſyſtem is affected by too much tone, the general remedies ſhould be,</p>
            <p n="1">I. BLOOD-LETTING. Of the efficacy of this remedy in diſpoſing ulcers ſuddenly to heal, the two clinical patients beforementioned, exhibited re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable proofs laſt winter, in the preſence of all the ſtudents of medicine in the univerſity. The blood drawn was ſizy in both caſes. I have not the merit of having introduced this remedy into practice in the cure of ulcers. I learned it from Sir John Pringle. I have known it to be uſed with equal ſucceſs in a ſore breaſt, attended by pain and inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, after all the uſual remedies for that diſorder had been uſed to no purpoſe. I anticipate here a repetition of an objection to this remedy by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who cannot, at firſt ſight, reconcile exceſſive action in the arterial ſyſtem with the debility which prediſpoſes to it. I refer the reader for a defence of it, to what was ſaid upon the ſubject of bleeding in the inflammatory ſpecies of conſumption. It will only be neceſſary to add in this place, that indirect, like direct debility, when of ſhort duration, never fails to produce ſuch a degree of excitability, or vibratility (if I may be allowed to coin a word) in
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:026112_0279_0FCFF327AEBEE758"/>
the blood-veſſels, as to diſpoſe them to be thrown into exceſſive action by the leaſt increaſe in the force or number of the ſtimuli which act upon the human body.</p>
            <p n="2">II. GENTLE PURGES.</p>
            <p n="3">III. NITRE. From fifteen to twenty grains of this medicine ſhould be given three times a-day.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. A TEMPERATE diet, and a total abſtinence from fermented and diſtilled liquors.</p>
            <p n="5">V. COOL and pure air.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>local</hi> remedies in this ſtate of the ſyſtem ſhould be,</p>
            <p n="1">I. COLD water. Dr. Rigby has written largely in favour of this remedy when applied to local in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammations. From its good effects in allaying the inflammation which ſometimes follows the punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which is made in the arm in communicating the ſmall pox, and from the ſudden relief it affords in the inflammatory ſpecies of the ophthalmia and in the piles, no one can doubt of its efficacy in ſore legs, accompanied by inflammation in thoſe veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, which are the immediate ſeat of the diſorder.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="284" facs="unknown:026112_0280_0FCFF3294D7E9AE8"/>II. SOFT poultices of bread and milk, or of bread moiſtened with lead water. Dr. Underwood's method of making a poultice of bread and milk ſhould be preferred in this caſe. He directs us firſt to boil the milk, then to powder the bread, and throw it into the milk, and after they have been intimately mixed, by being well ſtirred and boiled together, they ſhould be poured out and ſpread upon a rag, and a knife dipped in ſweet oil or lard, ſhould be run over them. The ſolidity and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence of the poultice is hereby better preſerved, than when the oil or lard is mixed with the bread and milk over the fire.</p>
            <p n="3">III. When the inflammation ſubſides, dry lint ſhould be applied to the ſore, and confined by means of a ſoft plaſter of wax and ſweet oil.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. ABOVE all, reſt, and an horizontal poſture of the leg. Too much cannot be ſaid in favor of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy in this ſpecies of ſore legs. Nannoni, the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Italian ſurgeon, ſums up the cure of ſore legs in three words, viz. "Tempo, ripoſo, e pazienza;" that is, in time, reſt and patience. A friend of mine, who was cured by this ſurgeon, of a ſore leg, about thirty years ago, informed me, that he confined him to his bed, during the greateſt part of the time that he was under his care.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="285" facs="unknown:026112_0281_0FCFF32A92F27E90"/>IN ſore legs, attended by too little general and local action, the following remedies are proper.</p>
            <p n="1">I. BARK. It ſhould be uſed plentifully, but with a conſtant reference to the ſtate of the ſyſtem; for the changes in the weather, and other acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal circumſtances often produce ſuch changes in the ſyſtem, as to render its diſuſe for a ſhort time fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently neceſſary.</p>
            <p n="2">II. MERCURY. This remedy has been ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to act by altering the fluids, or by diſcharging a morbid matter from them, in curing ſore legs. But this is by no means the caſe. It appears to act as an univerſal ſtimulant; and if it prove moſt uſeful when it excites a ſalivation, it is only becauſe in this way it excites the moſt general action in the ſyſtem.</p>
            <p n="3">III MINERAL TONICS—ſuch as the different preparations of iron, copper, and zinc.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. GENTLE EXERCISE. Reſt, and a recum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent poſture of the body, ſo proper in the tonic, are both hurtful in this ſpecies of ſore legs. The efficacy of exerciſe, even of the active kind, in the cure of ſore legs, accompanied by deficient ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the veſſels, may eaſily be conceived from
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:026112_0282_0FCFF32C1893AFE0"/>
its good effects after gun-ſhot wounds which are mentioned by Dr. Jackſon.<note n="*" place="bottom">Medical Journal, 1790.</note> He tells us, that thoſe Britiſh ſoldiers who had been wounded at the battle of Guilford, in North-Carolina, who were turned out of the military hoſpitals and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed the army, ſooneſt recovered of their wounds. It was remarkable that if they delayed only a few days on the road, their wounds grew worſe, or ceaſed to heal.</p>
            <p>IN the uſe of the different ſpecies of exerciſe the ſame regard ſhould be had to the ſtate of the ſyſtem which was recommended in a former diſorder.</p>
            <p n="5">V. A NUTRITIOUS and moderately ſtimulating diet, conſiſting of milk, ſaccharine vegetables, ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal food, malt-liquors, and wine.</p>
            <p>WORT has done great ſervice in ſore legs. I am at a loſs to determine whether it acts by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veying a quantity of gently ſtimulating and nutri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious matter into the ſyſtem, or by correcting a ſcorbutic diatheſis in the blood. The manner in which I have directed it to be prepared and taken is as follows—To three or four <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> table-ſpoonsful of the malt, finely powdered and ſifted,
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:026112_0283_0FCFF32DDEFB1B48"/>
add two table ſpoonsful of brown ſugar, and three or four of Madeira, Sherry, or Liſbon wine, and a quart of boiling water. After they have ſtood a few hours, it may be drunken liberally by the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, ſtirring it each time before he takes it, ſo that the whole ſubſtance of the malt may be conveyed into the ſtomach. A little lime-juice may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, if the patient requires it, to make it more pleaſant. The above quantity may be taken once, twice, or three times a day at the pleaſure of the patient, or according to the indication of his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order.</p>
            <p n="5">VI. OPIUM. This remedy is not only uſeful in eaſing the pain of a ſore leg, but co-operates with other cordial medicines in invigorating the whole ſyſtem.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>local</hi> applications ſhould conſiſt of ſuch ſubſtances as are gently eſcarotic, and which excite an action in the torpid veſſels of the affected part. Arſenic, precipitate, and blue vitriol, have all been employed with ſucceſs for this purpoſe. Dr. Grif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitts informed me, that he has frequently accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed the ſame thing in the Diſpenſary by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications of tartar emetic. They ſhould all be uſed, if neceſſary, in ſucceſſion to each other; for there is often the ſame idioſyncraſy in a ſore leg to cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain topical applications, that there is in the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:026112_0284_0FCFF32FCDD0D998"/>
to certain aliments. After the uſe of theſe remedies, aſtringents and tonics ſhould be applied, ſuch as an infuſion of Peruvian, or white-oak bark; the water in which the ſmiths extinguiſh their irons, lime-water, bread dipped in a weak ſolution of green vitriol (ſo much commended by Dr. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwood) and compreſſes wetted with brandy, or ardent ſpirits of any kind.</p>
            <p>TIGHT bandages are likewiſe highly proper here. The laced ſtocking has been much uſed. It is made of ſtrong coarſe linen. Dr. Underwood gives ſeveral good reaſons for preferring a flannel roller to the linen ſtocking. It ſets eaſier on the leg, and yields to the ſwelling of the muſcles in walking.</p>
            <p>IN ſcorbutic ſores on the legs, navy ſurgeons have ſpoken in high terms of an application of a mixture of lime-juice and melaſſes. Mr. Gilleſpie commends the uſe of lime or lemon-juice alone, and aſcribes many cures to it in the Britiſh navy during the late war, after every common application had been uſed to no purpoſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">Medical Journal, Vol. VI.</note>
            </p>
            <p>IT is of the utmoſt conſequence in the treatment of ſore legs, to keep them clean, by frequent dreſſings
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:026112_0285_0FCFF3355460B878"/>
and waſhings. The ſucceſs of old women is oftener derived from their great attention to cleanlineſs, in the management of ſore legs, than to any ſpecifics they poſſeſs which are unknown to phyſicians.</p>
            <p>WHEN ſore legs are kept from healing by affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the bone, the treatment ſhould be ſuch as is recommended by practical writers on ſurgery.</p>
            <p>I SHALL conclude this inquiry by four obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which are naturally ſuggeſted by what has been delivered upon this diſorder.</p>
            <p n="1">1. IF it has been proved that ſore legs are, in moſt caſes, diſeaſes of the whole ſyſtem, is it not proper to inquire, whether many other diſeaſes ſuppoſed to be local are not in like manner diſeaſes of the whole ſyſtem? And if ſore legs have been cured by general remedies, is it not proper to uſe them more frequently in other local diſeaſes?— I am led to make this remark by having ſeen two inſtances of tumors, the one on the breaſt, and the other in the proſtate gland, nearly cured by long journies.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IF there be two ſtates of action in the arteries in ſore legs, it becomes us to inquire, whether the ſame oppoſite ſtates of action do not take place in many diſeaſes in which they are not ſuſpected. I have
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:026112_0286_0FCFF3369464CF58"/>
before obſerved, that they occur in the ſcrofula. It would be eaſy to prove, that they exiſt in ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral other local diſeaſes.</p>
            <p n="3">3. IF the efficacy of the remedies for ſore legs which have been mentioned, depends upon their being accommodated exactly to the ſtate of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial ſyſtem, and if this ſyſtem be liable to fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent changes, does it not become us to be more attentive to the ſtate of the pulſe in this diſorder than is commonly ſuppoſed to be neceſſary by phyſicians?—Indeed, if one of the principles I have aimed to eſtabliſh in this and ſeveral of the foregoing eſſays be juſt, that is, that all preſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould be ſuited to the <hi>ſtate,</hi> and not to the <hi>name,</hi> of a diſeaſe, it follows that ſucceſs in the practice of phyſic will depend chiefly upon the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſional change of the doſe, or quality of a medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cine with the changing ſtate of the whole ſyſtem.</p>
            <p n="4">4. IT has been a misfortune in medicine, as well as in other ſciences, for men to aſcribe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects to one cauſe, which ſhould be aſcribed to many. Hence diſeaſes have been attributed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſively to morbid affections of the fluids by ſome, and of the muſcles, and nerves by others. Unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately the morbid ſtates of the arterial ſyſtem, and the influence of thoſe ſtates upon the brain—
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:026112_0287_0FCFF33A45FC64F8"/>
the nerves—the muſcles—the lymphatics—the glands—the viſcera—the alimentary canal—and the ſkin, as well as the reciprocal influence of the morbid ſtates of each of thoſe parts of the body upon the arteries, and upon each other, have been too much neglected in moſt of our ſyſtems of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſic. I conſider the pathology of the arterial ſyſtem as a mine. It was firſt diſcovered by Dr. Cullen. The man who attempts to explore it, will probably impoveriſh himſelf by his reſearches; but the men who come after him, will certainly obtain from it a treaſure which cannot fail of adding greatly to the riches of medicine.</p>

            <head>An ACCOUNT, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>MOST of the facts which I ſhall deliver upon this ſubject, are the reſult of obſervations made during the laſt five years, upon perſons of both ſexes, who had paſſed the 80th year of their lives. I intended to have given a detail of the names—manner of life—occupations—and other circumſtances of each of them; but, upon a review of my notes, I found ſo great a ſameneſs in the hiſtory of moſt of them, that I deſpaired, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailing them, of anſwering the intention which I have purpoſed in the following eſſay. I ſhall, therefore, only deliver the facts and principles which are the reſult of the inquiries and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions I have made upon this ſubject.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="296" facs="unknown:026112_0290_0FCF49302E6A1868"/>I. I SHALL Mention the circumſtances which favour the attainment of longevity.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I SHALL mention the phaenomena of bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and mind which attend it: and,</p>
            <p n="3">III. I SHALL enumerate its peculiar diſeaſes, and the remedies which are moſt proper to remove, or moderate them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE circumſtances which favour longevity, are,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Deſcent from long-lived Anceſtors.</hi> I have not found a ſingle inſtance of a perſon, who has lived to be 80 years old, in whom this was not the caſe. In ſome inſtances I found the deſcent was only from one, but in general, it was from both parents. The knowledge of this faſt may ſerve, not only to aſſiſt in calculating what are called the chances of lives, but it may be made uſeful to a phyſician. He may learn from it to cheriſh hopes of his patients in chronic, and in ſome acute diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, in proportion to the capacity of life they have derived from their anceſtors.<note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. Franklin, who died in his 84th year, was deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from long-lived parents. His father died at 89, and his mother at 87. His father had 17 children by two wives. The Doctor informed me that he once ſat down as one of 11 adult ſons and daughters at his father's table. In an excur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion he once made to that part of England from whence his family migrated to America, he diſcovered in a grave-yard, the tomb-ſtones of ſeveral perſons of his name, who had li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be very old. Theſe perſons he ſuppoſed to have been his anceſtors.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="297" facs="unknown:026112_0291_0FCFF1FE32D31FA8"/>2. <hi>Temperance in Eating and Drinking.</hi> To this remark I found ſeveral exceptions. I met with one man of 84 years of age, who had been intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate in eating; and four or five perſons who had been intemperate in drinking ardent ſpirits. They had all been day-labourers, or had deferred drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing until they began to feel the languor of old age. I did not meet with a ſingle perſon who had not, for the laſt forty or fifty years of their lives, uſed tea, coffee, and bread and butter twice a day as part of their diet. I am diſpoſed to believe that thoſe articles of diet do not materially affect the duration of human life, although they evidently impair the ſtrength of the ſyſtem. The duration of life does not appear to depend ſo much upon the ſtrength of the body, or upon the quantity of its excitability, as upon an exact accommodation of ſtimuli to each of them. A watch ſpring will laſt as long as an anchor, provided the forces which
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:026112_0292_0FCFF20010340E58"/>
are capable of deſtroying both, are always in an exact ratio to their ſtrength. The uſe of tea and coffee in diet ſeems to be happily ſuited to the change which has taken place in the human body, by ſedentary occupations, by which means leſs nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhment and ſtimulus are required than formerly, to ſupport animal life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE <hi>Moderate exerciſe of the Underſtanding.</hi> It has long been an eſtabliſhed truth, that literary men (other circumſtances being equal) are longer lived than other people. But it is not neceſſary that the underſtanding ſhould be employed upon philoſophical ſubjects to produce this influence upon human life. Buſineſs, politics, and religion, which are the objects of attention of men of all claſſes, impart a vigour to the underſtanding, which, by being conveyed to every part of the body, tends to produce health and long life.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Equanimity of temper.</hi> The violent and ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular action of the paſſions tends to wear away the ſprings of life.</p>
            <p>PERSONS who live upon annuities in Europe have been obſerved to be longer lived, in equal circumſtances, than other people. This is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably occaſioned by their being exempted, by the certainty of their ſubſiſtence from thoſe fears of
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:026112_0293_0FCFF20214442BE0"/>
want which ſo frequently diſtract the minds, and thereby weaken the bodies of old people. Life-rents have been ſuppoſed to have the ſame i<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>
               <g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ence in prolonging life. Perhaps the <hi>deſire of life,</hi> in order to enjoy for as long a time as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that property which cannot be enjoyed a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time by a child or relation, may be another cauſe of the longevity of perſons who live upon certain incomes. It is a fact, that the deſire of life is a very powerful ſtimulus in prolonging it, eſpecially when that deſire is ſupported by hope. This is obvious to phyſicians every day. Deſpair of recovery, is the beginning of death in all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes.</p>
            <p>BUT obvious and reaſonable as the effects of equanimity of temper are upon human life, there are ſome exceptions in favor of paſſionate men and women having attained to a great age. The morbid ſtimulus of anger, in theſe caſes, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably obviated by leſs degrees, or leſs active exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſes of the underſtanding, or by the defect, or weakneſs of ſome of the other ſtimuli which keep up the motions of life.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Matrimony.</hi> In the courſe of my inquiries, I met with only one perſon beyond eighty years of age who had never been married.—I met with ſeveral women who had borne from 10
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:026112_0294_0FCFF2034A005938"/>
to 20 children, and ſuckled them all. I met with one woman, a native of Herefordſhire in England, who is now in the 100th year of her age, who bore a child at 60, menſtruated till 80, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently ſuckled two of her children (though born in ſucceſſion to each other) at the ſame time. She had paſſed the greateſt part of her life over a waſhing-tub.</p>
            <p n="6">6. I HAVE not found <hi>Sedentary Employments</hi> to prevent long life, where they are not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied by intemperance in eating or drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. This obſervation is not confined to literary men, nor to women only, in whom longevity with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out much exerciſe of body has been frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. I met with one inſtance of a weaver; a ſecond of a ſilver-ſmith; and a third of a ſhoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maker, among the number of old people, whoſe hiſtories have ſuggeſted theſe obſervations.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I HAVE not found that <hi>acute,</hi> nor that all <hi>chronic</hi> diſeaſes ſhorten human life. Dr. Franklin had two ſucceſſive vomicas in his lungs before he was 40 years old. I met with one man beyond 80, who had ſurvived a moſt violent attack of the yellow fever; a ſecond who had had ſeveral of his bones fractured by falls, and in frays: and many who had been frequently affected by intermittents. I
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:026112_0295_0FCFF204B8AE3548"/>
met with one man of 86, who had all his life been ſubject to ſyncope; another who had for 50 years been occaſionally affected by a cough;<note n="*" place="bottom">This man's only remedy for his cough, was the fine powder of dry Indian turnip, and honey.</note> and two inſtances of men who had been afflicted for forty years with obſtinate head-achs.<note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. Thiery ſays, That he did not find the itch, or ſlight degrees of the leproſy to prevent longevity. Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations de Phyſique, et de Medicine faites en differens leaux de L'Eſpagne. Vol. II. p. 171.</note> I met with only one perſon beyond 80, who had ever been affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a diſorder in the <hi>ſtomach</hi>; and in him, it aroſe from an occaſional rupture. Mr. John Strangeways Hutton, of this city, who died laſt year, in the 109th year of his age, informed me, that he had never puked in his life. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance is the more remarkable as he paſſed ſeveral years at ſea when a young man.<note n="‡" place="bottom">The venerable old man, whoſe hiſtory firſt ſuggeſted this remark, was born in New-York in the year 1684— His grandfather lived to be 101, but was unable to walk for thirty years before he died, from an exceſſive quantity of fat. His mother died at 91. His conſtant drinks were wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, beer, and cyder. He had a fixed diſlike to ſpirits of all kinds. His appetite was good, and he ate plentifully during the laſt years of his life. He ſeldom drank any thing be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween his meals. He was never intoxicated but twice in his life, and that was when a boy, and at ſea, where he remembers perfectly well to have celebrated by a feu de joye the birth day of Queen Ann. He was formerly afflicted with the head-ach, and giddineſs, but never had a fever, except from the ſmall-pox, in the courſe of his life. His pulſe was ſlow, but regular. He had been twice married. By his firſt wife he had 8, and by his ſecond 17 children. One of them lived to be 83 years of age. He was about five feet nine inches in height, of a ſlender make, and carried an <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> to the laſt year of his life</note> Theſe facts may ſerve to extend our ideas of the importance
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:026112_0296_0FCFF2089A3C9938"/>
of a healthy ſtate of the ſtomach in the animal oeco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomy; and thereby to add to our knowledge in the prognoſis of diſeaſes, and in the choices of human life.</p>
            <p n="8">8. I HAVE not found the <hi>loſs of teeth</hi> to affect the duration of human life, ſo much as might be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. Edward Drinker, who lived to be 103 years old, loſt his teeth thirty years before he di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from drawing the hot ſmoke of tobacco into his mouth through a ſhort pipe.</p>
            <p>DR. SAYRE, of New-Jerſey, to whom I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>debted for ſeveral very valuable hiſtories of old perſons, mentions one man aged 81, whoſe teeth began to decay at 16, and another of 90, who loſt his teeth thirty years before he ſaw him. The
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:026112_0297_0FCFF20E0B893B58"/>
gums, by becoming hard, perform, in part, the office of teeth: But may not the gaſtric juice of the ſtomach, like the tears and urine, become acrid by age, and thereby ſupply, by a more diſſolving power, the defect of maſtication from the loſs of teeth? Analogies might eaſily be adduced from ſeveral operations of nature, which go forward in the animal oeconomy, which render this ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion highly probable.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I HAVE not obſerved <hi>Baldneſs,</hi> or <hi>Grey Hairs,</hi> occurring in early or middle life, to prevent old age. In one of the hiſtories furniſhed me by Dr. Sayre, I find an account of a man of 81, whoſe hair began to aſſume a ſilver colour when he was only one and twenty years of age.</p>
            <p>I SHALL conclude this head by the following remark—</p>
            <p>NOTWITHSTANDING there appears in the human body a certain capacity of long life, which ſeems to diſpoſe it to preſerve its exiſtence in every ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation; yet this capacity does not always protect it from premature deſtruction; for among the old peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple whom I examined, I ſcarcely met with one who had not loſt brothers or ſiſters, in early and middle
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:026112_0298_0FCFF20FD93D3E20"/>
life, who were born under circumſtances equally favourable to longevity with themſelves.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I COME now to mention ſome of the phae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomena of the body and mind which occur in old age.</p>
            <p n="1">1. THERE is a great ſenſibility to <hi>cold</hi> in all old people. I met with an old woman of 84, who ſlept conſtantly under three blankets and a coverlit du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the hotteſt ſummer months. The ſervant of prince de Beaufremont, who came from Mount Jura to Paris at the age of 121, to pay his reſpects to the firſt national aſſembly of France, ſhivered with cold in the middle of the dog days, when he was not near a good fire. The national aſſembly directed him to ſit with his hat on, in order to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend his head from the cold.</p>
            <p n="2">2. IMPRESSIONS made upon the <hi>ears</hi> of old people, excite ſenſation and reflexion much quicker than when they are made upon their eyes. Mr. Hutton informed me, that he had frequently met his ſons in the ſtreet without knowing them until they had ſpoken to him. Dr. Franklin informed me that he rcognized his friends, after a long ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence from them, firſt by their voices. This fact
<pb n="305" facs="unknown:026112_0299_0FCFF2115A8F6488"/>
does not contradict the common opinion, upon the ſubject of memory, for the recollection in theſe inſtances, is the effect of what is called reminiſcence, which differs from memory in being excited only by the renewal of the impreſſion which at firſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced the idea which is revived.</p>
            <p n="2">2. THE <hi>appetite</hi> for food is generally increaſed in old age. The famous Parr, who died at 152, ate heartily in the laſt week of his life. The kindneſs of nature, in providing this laſt portion of earthly enjoyments for old people, deſerves to be noticed. It is remarkable, that they have, like children, a frequent recurrence of appetite, and ſuſtain with great uneaſineſs the intervals of regular meals. The obſervation, therefore, made by Hippocrates, that middle-aged people are more affected by ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinence than thoſe who are old, is not true. This might eaſily be proved by many appeals to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords of medicine; but old people differ from children, in preferring <hi>ſolid</hi> to liquid aliment. From inattention to this fact, Dr. Mead has done great miſchief by adviſing old people, as their teeth decayed or periſhed, to leſſen the quantity of their ſolid, and to increaſe the quantity of their liquid food. This advice is contrary to nature, and experience, and I have heard of two old per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who deſtroyed themſelves by following it. The circulation of the blood is ſupported in old
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:026112_0300_0FCFF21480A4EEA8"/>
people chiefly by the ſtimulus of aliment. The action of liquids of all kinds upon the ſyſtem is weak, and of ſhort continuance, compared with the durable ſtimulus of ſolid food. There is a gradation in the action of this food upon the body. Animal matters are preferred to vegetable; the fat of meat, to the lean, and ſalted meat to freſh, by moſt old people. I have met with but few old people who retained an appetite for milk. It is remarkable, that a leſs quantity of <hi>ſtrong drink</hi> produces intoxication in old people than in perſons in the middle of life. This depends upon the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of the ſame ſtate of the ſyſtem, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to excitability, which takes place in childhood. Many old people, from an ignorance of this fact, have made ſhipwreck of characters which have commanded reſpect in every previous ſtage of their lives. From the ſame recurrence of the excitability of childhood in their ſyſtems, they commonly drink their tea and coffee much weaker than in early or middle life.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE <hi>pulſe</hi> is generally full, and frequently affected by pauſes in its pulſations when felt in the wriſts of old people. A regular pulſe in ſuch per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons indicates a diſeaſe, as it ſhews the ſyſtem to be under the impreſſion of a preternatural ſtimulus of ſome kind. This obſervation was ſuggeſted to me
<pb n="307" facs="unknown:026112_0301_0FCFF2166B328478"/>
above twenty years ago by Morgagni, and I have often profited by it in attending old people. The pulſe in ſuch patients is an uncertain mark of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture or degree of an acute diſeaſe. It ſeldom partakes of the quickneſs or convulſive action of the arterial ſyſtem, which attends fever in young or middle-aged people. I once attended a man of 77 in a fever of the bilious kind, which confined him for eight days to his bed, in whom I could not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the leaſt quickneſs or morbid action in his pulſe until four and twenty hours before he died.</p>
            <p n="4">4. THE marks of old age appear earlier, and are more numerous in perſons who have combined with hard labour, a vegetable or ſcanty diet, than in perſons who have lived under oppoſite circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. I think I have obſerved theſe marks of old age to occur ſooner, and to be more numerous in the German, than in the Engliſh or Iriſh citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens of Pennſylvania. They are likewiſe more common among the inhabitants of country places, than of cities, and ſtill more ſo among the Indians of North America, than among the inhabitants of civilized countries.</p>
            <p n="5">5. OLD men tread upon the <hi>whole baſe</hi> of their feet at once in <hi>walking.</hi> This is perhaps one reaſon why they wear out fewer ſhoes, under the ſame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:026112_0302_0FCFF21E49EAE120"/>
of conſtant uſe, than young people, who by treading on the poſterior, and riſing on the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terior part of their feet, expoſe their ſhoes to more unequal preſſure and friction. The advantage de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived to old people from this mode of walking is very obvious. It leſſens that diſpoſition to totter which is always connected with weakneſs:—hence we find the ſame mode of walking is adopted by habitual drunkards, and is ſometimes from habit practiſed by them, when they are not under the influence of ſtrong drink.</p>
            <p n="6">6. THE <hi>memory</hi> is the firſt faculty of the mind which fails in the decline of life. While recent events paſs through the mind without leaving an impreſſion upon it, it is remarkable that the long forgotten events of childhood and youth are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>called and diſtinctly remembered.</p>
            <p>I MET with a ſingular inſtance of a German wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, who had learned to ſpeak the language of our country after ſhe was forty years of age, who had forgotten every word of it after ſhe had paſſed her 80th year, but ſpoke the German language as flu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently as ever ſhe had done. The memory decays ſooneſt in hard drinkers. I have obſerved ſome ſtudious men to ſuffer a decay of their memories, but never of their underſtandings. Among theſe,
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:026112_0303_0FCFF220CA5FFD98"/>
was the late Anthony Benezet of this city. But even this infirmity did not abate the chearfulneſs, or leſſen the happineſs of this pious philoſopher, for he once told me, when I was a young man, that he had a conſolation in the decay of his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, which gave him a great advantage over me. "You can read a good book (ſaid he) with plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure but <hi>once,</hi> but when I read a good book, I ſo ſoon forget the contents of it, that I have the plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of reading it over and over; and every time I read it, it is alike new and delightful to me."— The celebrated Dr. Swift was one of thoſe few ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious men, who have exhibited marks of a decay of underſtanding in old age; but it is judiciouſly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed by Dr. Johnſon to two cauſes which reſcue books, and the exerciſe of the thinking powers, from having had any ſhare in inducing that diſeaſe upon his mind. Theſe cauſes were, a raſh vow which he made when a young man, never to uſe ſpectacles, and a ſordid ſecluſion of himſelf from company, by which means he was cut off from the uſe of books, and the benefits of converſation, the abſence of which left his mind without its uſual ſtimulus—hence it collapſed into a ſtate of fatuity. It is probably owing to the conſtant exerciſe of the underſtanding, that literary men poſſeſs that faculty of the mind in a vigorous ſtate in extreme old age. The ſame cauſe accounts for old people preſerving
<pb n="310" facs="unknown:026112_0304_0FCFF222FB7BB8E0"/>
their intellects longer in cities, than in country places. They enjoy ſociety upon ſuch eaſy terms in the former ſituation, that their minds are kept more conſtantly in an excited ſtate by the acquiſition of new, or the renovation of old ideas, by means of converſation.</p>
            <p n="7">7. I DID not meet with a ſingle inſtance in which the moral or religious faculties were impaired in old people. I do not believe, that theſe faculties of the mind are preſerved, by any ſupernatural power, but wholly by the conſtant and increaſing exerciſe of them in the evening of life. In the courſe of my inquiries, I heard of a man of 101 years of age, who declared that he had forgotten every thing he had ever known, except his GOD. I found the moral faculty, or a diſpoſition to do kind offices, to be exquiſitely ſenſible in ſeveral old peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in whom there was ſcarcely a trace left of me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory or underſtanding.</p>
            <p n="8">8. DREAMING is univerſal among old people. It appears to be brought on by their imperfect ſleep, of which I ſhall ſay more hereafter.</p>
            <p n="9">9. I MENTIONED formerly the ſign of a <hi>ſecond childhood</hi> in the ſtate of the appetite in old people. It appears further,—1. In the marks which ſlight
<pb n="311" facs="unknown:026112_0305_0FCFF224152C0F28"/>
contuſions or impreſſions leave upon their ſkins. 2. In their being ſoon fatigued by walking or exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, and in being as ſoon refreſhed by reſt. 3. In their diſpoſition, like children, to detail immediately every thing they ſee and hear. And, 4. In their aptitude to ſhed tears; hence they are unable to tell a ſtory that is in any degree diſtreſſing without weeping. Dr. Moore takes notice of this pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarity in Voltaire, after he had paſſed his 80th year. He wept conſtantly at the recital of his own tragedies. This feature in old age did not eſcape Homer. Old Menelaus wept ten years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he returned from the deſtruction of Troy, when he ſpoke of the death of the heroes who periſhed before that city.</p>
            <p n="10">10. IT would be ſufficiently humbling to human nature, if our bodies exhibited in old age the marks only of a ſecond childhood; but human weakneſs deſcends ſtill lower. I met with an inſtance of a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man between 80 and 90, who exhibited the marks of a <hi>ſecond infancy,</hi> by ſuch a total decay of her mental faculties as to loſe all conſciouſneſs in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging her alvine and urinary excretions. In this ſtate of the body, a diſpoſition to ſleep, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds the wakefulneſs of the firſt ſtages of old age. Dr. Haller mentions an inſtance of a very old man
<pb n="312" facs="unknown:026112_0306_0FCFF2295D7AE7D0"/>
who ſlept twenty, out of every twenty-four hours during the few laſt years of his life.</p>
            <p n="11">11. THE diſpoſition in the ſyſtem to <hi>renew</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain parts in extreme old age, has been mentioned by ſeveral authors. Many inſtances are to be met with in the records of medicine of the ſight<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>There is a remarkable inſtance of the ſight having been reſtored after it had been totally deſtroyed in an old man near Reading in Pennſylvania. My brother, Jacob Ruſh, fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed me with the following account of him in a letter from Reading, dated June 23, 1792.—</p>
                  <p>"AN old man of 84 years of age, of the name of Adam Riffle, near this town, gradually loſt his ſight in the 68th year of his age, and continued entirely blind for the ſpace of twelve years. About four years ago his ſight returned, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out making uſe of any means for the purpoſe, and without any viſible change in the appearance of the eyes, and he now ſees as well as ever he did. I have ſeen the man, and have no doubt of the fact. He is at this time ſo hearty, as to be able to walk from his houſe to Reading, (about three miles) which he frequently does in order to attend church. I ſhould obſerve, that during both the gradual loſs, and recovery of his ſight, he was no ways affected by ſickneſs, but on the contrary enjoyed his uſual health. I have this account from his daughter and ſon in-law, who live within a few doors of me."</p>
               </note> and hearing having been reſtored, and even of the teeth having been renewed in old people a few years be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore death. Theſe phenomena have led me to ſuſpect,
<pb n="313" facs="unknown:026112_0307_0FCFF22ACF19F780"/>
that the antediluvian age was attained by the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent renovation of different parts of the body, and that when they occur, they are an effort of the cauſes which ſupport animal life, to produce antediluvian longevity, by acting upon the revived excitability of the ſyſtem.</p>
            <p n="12">12. THE <hi>fear</hi> of death appears to be much leſs in old age, than in early, or middle life. I met with many old people who ſpoke of their diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with compoſure, and with ſome who expreſſed earneſt deſires to lie down in the grave. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference to life, and deſire for death (whether they ariſe from ſatiety in worldly purſuits and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, or from a deſire of being relieved from pain) appear to be a wiſe law in the animal oeconomy, and worthy of being claſſed with thoſe laws which accommodate the body and mind of man to all the natural evils, to which, in the common order of things, they are neceſſarily expoſed.</p>
            <p n="3">III. I COME now briefly to enumerate the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of old age, and the remedies which are moſt proper to remove, or to mitigate them.</p>
            <p>THE diſeaſes are chronic and acute. The CHRONIC are,</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="314" facs="unknown:026112_0308_0FCFF23338349878"/>1. WEAKNESS of the <hi>knees</hi> and <hi>ankles,</hi> a leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſened ability to walk, and tremors in the head and limbs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. PAINS <hi>in the bones,</hi> known among noſologi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal writers by the name of rheumitalgia.</p>
            <p n="3">3. INVOLUNTARY <hi>flow of tears,</hi> and of mucus from the noſe.</p>
            <p n="4">4. DIFFICULTY <hi>of breathing,</hi> and a ſhort <hi>cough,</hi> with copious expectoration. A weak, or hoarſe voice generally attends this cough.</p>
            <p n="5">5. COSTIVENESS.</p>
            <p n="6">6. AN <hi>inability to retain the urine</hi> as long as in early or middle life. Few perſons beyond 60 paſs a whole night without being obliged to diſcharge their urine<note n="*" place="bottom">I met with an old man who informed me, that if from any accident he retained his urine after he felt an inclination to diſcharge it, he was affected by a numbneſs, accompanied by an uneaſy ſenſation in the palms of his hands.</note>. Perhaps the ſtimulus of this liquor in the bladder may be one cauſe of the univerſality of dreaming among old people. It is certainly a frequent cauſe of dreaming in perſons in early and
<pb n="315" facs="unknown:026112_0309_0FCFF235CDDFA2C0"/>
middle life: this I infer, from its occurring chiefly in the morning when the bladder is moſt diſtended with urine. There is likewiſe an inability in old people to diſcharge their urine as quickly as in early life. I think I have obſerved this to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the firſt ſymptoms of the declenſion of the ſtrength of the body by age.</p>
            <p n="7">7th. WAKEFULNESS. This is probably produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in part by the action of the urine upon the bladder; but ſuch is the excitability of the ſyſtem in the firſt ſtages of old age, that there is no pain ſo light, no anxiety ſo trifling, and no ſound ſo ſmall, as not to produce wakefulneſs in old people. It is owing to their imperfect ſleep, that they are ſometimes as unconſcious of the moment of their paſſing from a ſleeping to a waking ſtate, as young and middle aged people are of the moment in which they paſs from the waking to a ſleeping ſtate. Hence we ſo often hear them complain of paſſing ſleepleſs nights. This is no doubt fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently the caſe, but I am ſatisfied, from the reſult of an inquiry made upon this ſubject, that they often ſleep without knowing it, and that their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints in the morning, of the want of ſleep, ariſe from ignorance, without the leaſt intention to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive.</p>
            <p n="8">
               <pb n="316" facs="unknown:026112_0310_0FCFF236DB7CFCC0"/>8. <hi>Giddineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Deafneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="10">10. <hi>Imperfect viſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE ACUTE diſeaſes moſt common among old people, are</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Imflammation of the eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. THE <hi>pnuemonia notha,</hi> or baſtard peripneu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</p>
            <p n="3">3. THE <hi>colic.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Palſy</hi> and <hi>apoplexy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. THE <hi>piles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="6">6. A <hi>difficulty</hi> in <hi>making water.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Quartan fever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>ALL the diſeaſes of old people, both chronic and acute, originate in debility. The remedies for the former, where no morbid action takes place in the ſyſtem, are ſtimulants. The firſt of theſe is,</p>
            <p n="1">I. HEAT. The ancient Romans prolonged life by retiring to Naples, as ſoon as they felt the infirmities of age coming upon them. The aged Portugueſe imitate them, by approaching the mild ſun of Brazil, in South America. But
<pb n="317" facs="unknown:026112_0311_0FCF49319B490BE0"/>
heat may be applied to the torpid bodies of old people artificially—1ſt. By means of the <hi>warm bath.</hi> Dr. Franklin owed much of the cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and general vigor of body and mind which characterized his old age, to his regular uſe of this remedy. It diſpoſed him to ſleep, and even produced a reſpite from the pain of the ſtone, with which he was afflicted during the laſt years of his life.</p>
            <p n="2">2. HEAT may be applied to the bodies of old people by means of <hi>ſtove rooms.</hi> The late Dr. De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wit of Germantown, who lived to be near an 100 years of age, ſeldom breathed an air below 72°, after he became an old man. He lived conſtantly in a ſtove room.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Warm cloathing,</hi> more eſpecially warm bed-clothes, are proper to preſerve or increaſe the heat of old people. From the neglect of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, they are often found dead in their beds in the morning, after a cold night, in all cold countries. The late Dr. Chovet, of this city, who lived to be 85 ſlept in a baize night gown, under eight blank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, and a coverlet, in a ſtove room, many years before he died. The head ſhould be defended in old people by means of woollen, or fur caps, in the night, and by wigs and hats during the day, in
<pb n="318" facs="unknown:026112_0312_0FCFF238ABC765C0"/>
cold weather. Theſe artificial coverings will be the more neceſſary, where the head has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of its natural covering. Great pains ſhould be taken likewiſe to keep the feet dry and warm, by means of thick ſhoes.<note n="*" place="bottom">I met with one man above 80, who defended his feet from moiſture by covering his ſhoes in wet weather with melted wax; and another who, for the ſame purpoſe, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his ſhoes every morning with a mixture compoſed of the following ingredients melted together—Lintſeed oil a pound, mutton ſuet eight ounces, bees-wax ſix ounces, and roſin four ounces. The mixture ſhould be moderately warmed, and then applied not only to the upper leather, but to the ſoles of the ſhoes. This compoſition, the old gentleman informed me, was extracted from a book entitled "The complete Fiſherman," publiſhed in England in the reign of queen Elizabeth. He had uſed it for twenty years in cold and wet weather, with great benefit, and ſeveral of his friends who had tried it, ſpoke of its efficacy in keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the feet dry, in high terms.</note> To theſe modes of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying and confining heat to the bodies of old people, a young bed-fellow has been added; but I conceive the three artificial modes which have been recommended, will be ſufficient without the uſe of one, which cannot be ſucceſsfully employed without a breach of delicacy or humanity.</p>
            <p n="2">II. TO keep up the action of the ſyſtem, <hi>gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous diet</hi> and <hi>drinks</hi> ſhould be given to old people.
<pb n="319" facs="unknown:026112_0313_0FCFF23AADA082F0"/>
For a reaſon mentioned formerly, they ſhould be indulged in eating between the ordinary meals of families. Wine ſhould be given to them in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. It has been emphatically called the milk of old age.</p>
            <p n="3">III. YOUNG COMPANY ſhould be preferred by old people to the company of perſons of their own age. I think I have obſerved old people to enjoy better health and ſpirits, when they have paſſed the evening of their lives in the families of their children, where they have been ſurrounded by grand children, than when they lived by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Even the ſolicitude they feel for the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of their deſcendants contributes to invigorate the circulation of the blood, and thereby to add fuel to the lamp of life.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. GENTLE EXERCISE. This is of great conſequence in promoting the health of old peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. It ſhould be moderate, regular, and always in fair weather.</p>
            <p n="5">V. CLEANLINESS. This ſhould by no means be neglected. The dreſs of old people ſhould not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be clean, but more elegant than in youth or middle life. It ſerves to divert the eye of ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors from obſerving the decay and deformity of
<pb n="320"
                   facs="unknown:026112_0314_0FCFF23C4116A020"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
the body, to view and admire that which is always agreeable to it.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. TO abate the pains of the chronic rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, and the uneaſineſs of the old man's cough (as it is called); alſo to remove wakefulneſs, and to reſtrain, during the night, a troubleſome inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to make water, OPIUM may be given with great advantage. Chardin informs us, that this medicine is frequently uſed in the eaſtern countries to abate the pains and weakneſſes of old age, by thoſe people who are debarred the uſe wine by the religion of Mahomet.</p>
            <p>I HAVE nothing to ſay upon the acute diſeaſes of old people, but what is to be found in moſt of our books of medicine, except to recommend BLEEDING in thoſe of them which are attended with plethora, and an inflammatory action in the pulſe. The degrees of appetite which belong to old age, the quality of the food taken, and the ſeden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary life which is generally connected with it, all concur to produce that ſtate of the ſyſtem, which requires the above evacuation. I am ſure that I have ſeen many of the chronic complaints of old peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple mitigated by it, and I have more than once ſeen it uſed with obvious advantage in their inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory diſeaſes. Theſe affections I have obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="321" facs="unknown:026112_0315_0FCFF240C25507D8"/>
to be more fatal among old people than is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally ſuppoſed. An inflammation of the lungs, which terminated in an abſceſs, deprived the world of Dr. Franklin. Dr. Chovet died of an inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation in his liver. The blood drawn from him a few days before his death was ſizy, and ſuch was the heat of his body, produced by his fever, that he could not bear more covering, (notwithſtanding his former habits of warm cloathing) than a ſheet in the month of January.</p>
            <p>DEATH from old age is the effect of a gradual palſy. It ſhews itſelf firſt in the eyes and ears in the decay of ſight and hearing—it appears next in the urinary bladder, in the limbs and trunk of the body, then in the ſphincters of the bladder and rectum, and finally in the nerves and brain, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying in the laſt, the exerciſe of all the faculties of the mind.</p>
            <p>FEW perſons appear to die of old age. Some one of the diſeaſes which have been mentioned, generally cuts the laſt thread of life.</p>
