            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               </gap> 
               <hi>End,</hi> and wherein this Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge does conſiſt.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Shew whereto this ſame Knowledge of our Mortality ſerveth, and what Benefits accrue therefrom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Conſider who it is that muſt furniſh us with his Wiſdom, and diſpoſe us by his Grace,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000833_0003_0FAB40B629312E68"/>
to know our Mortality? namely, God; imply'd in theſe words: <hi>Lord make me to know,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Enquire what Courſe is to be taken, and what to be done on our parts, that we may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with the Lord to beſtow that Wiſdom and Grace upon us.</p>
            <p n="5">5thly and Laſtly, Make ſome ſuitable Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
            <p>I began with the firſt thing propoſed, which was to explain more particularly, what 'tis <hi>to know our End,</hi> and wherein this Knowledge do's conſiſt.</p>
            <p>And therefore to know our End, do's as I take it, imply theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ſerious Thoughts and Conſideration of Death.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The good Effects which thoſe Thoughts, and that Conſideration ought to have on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining part of our Lives.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The ſerious thoughts and conſideration of Death, <hi>i. e</hi> of our Departure into another World, or of the Souls deſerting the Body.</p>
            <p>And concerning this, there are three things chiefly which we are concerned to take notice of.</p>
            <p n="1">1. That our Lives are in the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> God, which he may either prolong or abbreviate as in his <hi>Godly Wiſdom</hi> he ſeeth convenient, either continue to us, or take from us, when and by what means ſoever He pleaſeth.</p>
            <p n="2">2. That how long ſoever our End or Remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:000833_0004_0FAB40B6E93C2700"/>
hence be delay'd, we have great reaſon to prepare immediately for't.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That whether we make a due Preparation for Death, or whether we forbear, 'tis certain it will come, and that in no long time neither. The firſt of theſe, I ha' already diſpatcht. I paſs therefore immediately to the Second Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on: Which is,</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>That how long,</hi> &amp;c. Multitudes we daily ſee are ſuddenly ſnacht away; ſo ſuddenly, that they are ſcarce <hi>ſpared a little while,</hi> to take leave of their Surviving Friends, <hi>before they go hence, and are no more ſeen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And therefore O man, whoſoever thou art, whether aged and decriped, or even in thy young and healthful days, flatter not thy ſelf with ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary hopes that thou ſhalt have time enough to make thy ſelf ready for <hi>another</hi> State, when Sick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs comes and fairly warns thee to depart out of <hi>This</hi>; for thou knoweſt not how ſoon the <hi>King of Terrors</hi> may ſurprize thee; and by how much the more ſecure thou art, by ſo much the more unexpected and aſtoniſhing will his coming be.</p>
            <p>But farther, ſuppoſe Death ſhould lay hold on thee when thou thinkeſt not of him, what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability is there that thou ſhouldeſt in that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſternation which is common in theſe Caſes, be ſo much thy ſelf, or retain ſuch Preſence of Mind, as to make a ſufficient Preparation? Alas! Vain man! How ſhall I expoſtulate this Matter with thee? Shall I ſhew thee the Danger and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:000833_0005_0FAB40B7A8FD4D28"/>
folly of delaying to put thy ſelf in a readineſs? I fear thou wilt look on this as a needleſs work, ſhould I undertake it; for if the Almighty can Cut us off when he's minded, and when we are not in the leaſt aware of it, (as ſurely he can) it muſt undoubtedly be the greateſt Wiſdom and Safety in us to make a timely Proviſion, &amp; to be always on our Guard, if we mean ſo to <hi>Finiſh our Courſe,</hi> that from thenceforth there may be <hi>Laid up for us a Crown of Life.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Or rather, ſhall I Inſtruct thee in the miſchie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous Conſequences of truſting to a late Proviſion? Why this is the main Concern of our Lives, and is Old Age that State that is generally attended with continual Infirmities, Aches and Defects, a proper Seaſon to begin the Greateſt and moſt Difficult Task in? In our temporal Concerns, tho' of infinite leſs Moment, we act with greater Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and more like our ſelves; 'tis only in the management of our Spiritual Affairs, and things of the higheſt Concernment, that we ſo ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully Expoſe our ſelves. Do we not for Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple when the Caſe of ſome urgent, weighty Bui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs lies upon us, endeavour to diſpatch it with all the Expedition poſſible? How ſeldom do we fail, when a long and tedious Journey is to be taken, to be before-hand with the Sun, at leaſt to ſet out betimes in the Morning?</p>
            <p>Now does any Buſineſs in the World require ſo much haſte and care in the Execution of it, as that of, <hi>Working out our own Salvation with
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:000833_0006_0FAB40B868EF7E00"/>
Fear and Trembling,</hi> ſince this Task is extreamly difficult, and this ſhort Life the only time we have to perform it in; and why then do you not immediately ſet about it.</p>
            <p>Again, Are we not all Travelling to a better Country? and are we not all <hi>Strangers</hi> and <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journers</hi> here, and bound for Heaven, <hi>as all our Fathers were</hi>; nay, and is not the <hi>Gate ſtrait,</hi> and the <hi>Way narrow that leadeth</hi> to't; are there not multitudes of Hardſhips to be encountred, and innumerable Difficulties to be rubb'd through, before we can come to poſſeſs that <hi>Good Land:</hi> And why then (in Gods Name) do ye loiter? Why do ye put off the Journey from one time to another? as tho' 'twere a matter indifferent whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you advance or no; or as tho' God in His Superabundant Mercy would bring Happineſs to you, when by reaſon of Age, and Weakneſs you are leſs fit and diſpoſed to ſeek after That. Sirs, be not deceived, for tho' God muſt be confeſſed to be of great Kindneſs, and rich in Love; yet ſeeing his Goodneſs, does not ſwallow up his Juſtice and Truth, ſeeing he has Ordain'd, that by <hi>Running the Race that is ſet before us,</hi> we ſhould only preſume to obtain the promiſed Reward; ſeeing we cannot hope to procure this any other way; nay laſtly, ſeeing we have been idle, and laviſhed away that Time, and thoſe bleſſed Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities which were afforded on Purpoſe that we might prepare for our <hi>Change</hi>; we by truſting to a Late, or <hi>Death-bed Repentance,</hi> do not only
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:000833_0007_0FAB40B92A022680"/>
run the Risk of having our Sun ſet before our Work be done; but alſo of provoking God to accelerate and haſten our End, to abridge his Long-ſufferance, and to plung us down quick in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to <hi>Unſpeakable and Endleſs Miſery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It highly concerns us therefore moſt ſeriouſly to obſerve that wholeſome Admonition of our Lord and Saviour, Mat. 24.42, 43, 44. <hi>Watch therefore, for ye know not what Hour your Lord doth come. But know this, that if the Good man of the Houſe had known in what Watch the Thief would come, he would have watched, and would not have ſuffered his Houſe to be broken up. Therefore be ye alſo ready; for in ſuch an Hour as ye think not, the Son of Man cometh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Farther yet, ſuppoſe, which nevertheleſs we cannot poſſibly be well aſſured of, that we ſhall not be immaturely taken hence, but have ſome monitory ſymptoms of approaching Death, ſome friendly Sickneſs advertiſe us of our Danger; yet 'tis very uncertain, whether we ſhall then be in a Capacity to prepare our ſelves or not. For (the truth is) the very Diſtemper, which we depend upon, to forewarn us of our hazzardous Condition, and to Summon us to our Duty, may peradventure inpiſpoſe us too. Was you ever brought down to a Sick-bed? or do you know what it is to labour under the Pains and Throws, and Agonies of a Diſeaſed Body? If any among you will ſay they do, and can call to mind what the Effects of your Sufferings of this nature
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000833_0008_0FAB40B9E9CFF2F0"/>
have been, let me appeal to the Conſciences of thoſe People, whether the extremity of Anguiſh did not altogether unfit them for the underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, proſecuting or effecting any manner of Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, be it of greater or leſſer Moment.</p>
            <p>Take any man that's in preſent Torture, let it be the Girds and Twitches of the Gout or Stone, or ſome ſuch Tormenting Evil, engage him on a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Concern of your own, and put the Buſineſs wholly into his hands; let him but try for once how well he can manage it: &amp; you'l be ſatisfied in a little while that ſuch an one is utterly incapable of minding any thing but the Accuteneſs of his Miſery. If he that has a ſwimming Head, and an aching Heart, a diſturbed Brain, and unreliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Palate, feeble Hands, and trembling Joynts; and in ſhort, no ſound Part in his whole Body: If I ſay ſuch a diſtempered creature can be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to act rightly and commendably according to the nature of the Concern he is driving at, and the Exigency of the Occaſion that moves him to it, then I confeſs I have hitherto enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd a wrong notion of Sickneſs. But if on the contrary, he cannot be allow'd to act thus, as I am ſure he cannot, what ſhould make us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that they are not bewitcht, and given up to Sin, forſaken of their Reaſon, and to be deſpaired of, who will not repent nor think of their Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality in their Health, in their blooming Strength, and beſt Days?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:000833_0009_0FAB40BAA8FCEB80"/>I rather think we have greater Reaſon to upbraid and exclaim bitterly againſt them, but that they may too ſoon find an opportunity to ſave us that trouble, and be their own Accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers. May be the next time ſuch an one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tires into his Cloſet, or lays down his reſtleſs Body on his Couch; nothing but Satyr and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vective and disjoynted Complaints will come of it. Go hide thy ſelf in ſome private Corner, and hearken what he'll ſay then; See with what melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words he begins to wiſh now that he had em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy'd his early Time, his gay and briskeſt Days in preparing his accounts for a future Life: con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the miſchief and unreaſonableneſs of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferring <hi>ſo neceſſary,</hi> and withal <hi>ſo difficult</hi> a work to Sickneſs, the unfitteſt and moſt impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Time; appealing to himſelf, whom he alſo condemns for the heinouſneſs and preſumption of ſo doing: looking back on this his Negligence and Careleſsneſs, with Remorſe and Regret, and obſerving before him the terrible Proſpect of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Miſery with Horror and Diſtraction.</p>
            <p>Now the Graceleſs Wretch is brought to know himſelf, and to ſpeak his Thoughts; being under the awful ſenſe or his lamentable Condition; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſing from the conſideration of his own Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, chiding and rating him <hi>within</hi> for his Wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedneſs, and the Puniſhment awarded to his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pious Practices <hi>without</hi>; of his reſiſting the Checks and Reſtraints of Nature, before he contracted
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000833_0010_0FAB40BB68DFF188"/>
his Guilt, and of his being juſt ready to be conſign'd over to inſufferable Torments for e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver after.</p>
            <p>To conclude then; if it be true, that to delay our Reformation, or making ready for another World, till Sickneſs or Old Age for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceth us unto it, be a fooliſh and dangerous Adventure: if a ſudden and unexpected Death may come and defeat all treacherous Hopes of this kind; if ſuppoſe we do live to be Old, and had a long warning given us before we dy, (which yet is no good Policy to truſt to:) we cannot tell by reaſon of <hi>the deceitful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Sin,</hi> and our own Hearts together, and our often, contemning the Divine Grace alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, whether we ſhall be in our right Senſes, and capable to prepare for our <hi>Change</hi> or not; or whether God will uouchſafe to follow us with his deſpiſed Grace any longer: It muſt be confeſt on the force of all theſe Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations, that we ought <hi>to day while it is called to day,</hi> without either Demur or Procraſtinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to ſet about our Duty in good earneſt; and that becauſe, whether we do this or not, we muſt certainly Dy, and be called to a ſtrict Judgment in a very ſhort Time: which brings me to my next Particular, to ſhew.</p>
            <p n="3">3. That whether we make a due prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for Death, or whether we forbear, 'tis
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000833_0011_0FAB40BCE0A02088"/>
certain that will come, and indeed very quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly too. I am ſenſible, 'twere impertinent to prove, that all muſt <hi>once Dy</hi>; this is ſo well known, that it never was, nor ever will be doubted by any man in his right mind: but to tell people that they ſhall Dy e're long, in I know not how ſhort a Space, before they have time perhaps to confeſs their Sins, or to cry out for Mercy, is thought <hi>a hard ſaying,</hi> and few there be that are both able and willing <hi>to bear it.</hi> 'Tis uſual for men of diſſolute lives and Manners to disbelieve thoſe things that they do not like; they are firmly reſolved to put nothing in their Creed, but what makes for them. And this in ſome mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure is the reaſon why many are ſo hardly perſwaded of the Propinquity or Nearneſs of their <hi>Dying Day.</hi> They know they muſt part with their darling Vices, let it come when it will. They fear contrary to that falſe Confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and forced Bravery wherewith they were wont to deny the chief Articles of the Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian Faith, that things may prove in the End quite otherwiſe then was deſired; that there is a Judge to Condemn, and a Devil to torment, an Heaven loſt and forfeited, and an Hell which they muſt unavoidably and irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be caſt into</p>
            <p>From hence therefore we may conclude that the Reaſon why men wont entertain the Belief of theſe things, is becauſe it goes Counter to
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000833_0012_0FAB40BCE9A164F8"/>
their Wiſhes; (for Affection you know, is too apt to Byaſs Reaſon) and interfers with their Fancied Intereſt.</p>
            <p>But after all, it matters not how ſecure and confident ſuch Atheiſtical Perſons are, that all Things will be <hi>Hereafter</hi> as they Suppoſe and Hope for <hi>Here.</hi> Nay (to come cloſer to the preſent Deſign) it ſignifies nothing what a Strong Preſumption they pretend to have, that Death is a great way off; for 'tis impoſſible that any Man barely fancying things to be at ſuch or ſuch a Diſtance from him, ſhould preſently make 'em Vaniſh <hi>When,</hi> and <hi>Whither</hi> He wou'd have them. 'Tis common for Children to imagine that the Tops of Mountains touch the very Skies, but the Mountains will never be removed to that height by Virtue of that Childiſh Imagination No more can He, that (being in perfect Health) preſumes moſt on a long Life, if Death is nearly tho' inviſibly advancing towards him, either drive the haſty Meſſenger back, or make him keep at a remoter Diſtance, by the Strength and Peremp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torineſs of his Conceit. Alas! Death is as reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute as we can be for our Lives, whatever we think of him, and will by little and little Steal upon us.</p>
            <p>Men of twenty or thirty may Phancy that Death is in all likelihood far enough from them, and therefore will ſcorn to diſturb their Heads

about it yet; eſteeming it a point of Gallantry to defie it, and endeavour to blot out of their Minds all Apprehenſions, Fears and Jealouſies, at leaſt to ſtiffe them for a while; but notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Sand in the Glaſs runs down apace, without Stop or Intermiſſion; and Time, Deaths Subſtitute and chief Officer, whoſe Power no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can reſiſt or ſcape, may for ought any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy can tell mow them down in the prime of their Days, and <hi>midſt of their Journey.</hi> By com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Experience, we may be convinc't upon how weak and infirm a Thread our Lives are hung, and what a perfect Hair it is that holds us from dropping into our Grave. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the very Tombs of our deceas't Relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons we may read if we will, our own Frail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; They <hi>Inſtruct</hi> as well as <hi>Grieve</hi>; the Conſideration of our Friends being there laid in a cold Bed of Earth, directs us to infer that we ſhall ſoon ly by his Side; and the Thoughts of his having been but a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle before, perhaps more young and lively and brisk then we are, ſuppoſeth that we have no Certainty that we ſhall tarry long behind.</p>
            <p>But beſides, how frequently do we ſee with our own Eyes, many a ſtrong, healthy, robuſt Youth attended to his Burial by thoſe Companions, whoſe weak and ſickly Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution he was us'd to pitty? What a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:000833_0014_0FAB40BE691C3738"/>
thing is it for the beſt and moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>likely to Dy firſt? How many ſtrange In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of this Nature have we heard of within the Compaſs of ſome few Years? Nay, how many can our own Knowledge and Memory furniſh us withal? By odd and unaccountable Accidents are Multitudes brought to an unexpected End. 'Tis conſiderable, that the finer and more curious any thing is, the more eaſily it may be corrupted and ſpoiled. We ſee this conſtantly verified in moſt Caſes; but in no one more apparently, than in that of Life and Health, which, (next to the Watchful Providence of God) depend principally on the good Decorum of this beautiful and regular Frame of Humane Nature, I mean the Body: So Numerous, and yet ſo Nearly Linkt together, are all the Parts, ſo various and ſo neceſſary their Functions, that the ſmalleſt matter almoſt can diſorder, and this again go near to deſtroy the admirable Contexture of it. A Blow upon the Head, or a Bruiſe in the Fleſh, the Spraining of a Limb, or breaking a Vein, can Shatter the whole Frame into a Confuſion, fatal and incurable. The Inflamation of the Spirits, or Defect of Vital Heat; an Empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Veſſels that ſhou'd contain the Blood, or even a Superfluity of the Blood it ſelf; a Diſeaſe, or a Wound may pall our Courage, Enervate our Strength, Stop our

Breath, and contrary to Expectation, put a quick Period to our Lives. Many a man has died in his Sleep, when all the while ſuch as lay with him, knew nothing of the Matter; others have Died at Meals, when the Food, which they received into their Throats to nouriſh and ſtrengthen the Body, ſtuck immoveably in the Paſſage, and choaked them. Others moreover have been taken a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in the very Act of Sinning. So we read, <hi>Act.</hi> 5. that <hi>Ananias</hi> and <hi>Saphira his Wife</hi> were ſtruck dead with a Ly in their Mouths.</p>
            <p>And there are not wanting later Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of thoſe who have been ſurprized in the very utterance of an Oath, an Impre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, a Calumny, or a Falſhood. Who knows not that ſome have gone inſtantly from the heat of a Debauch, to the Fire of Hell; from wallowing in Voluptuouſneſs to be tormented for ever; from Soaking in Drun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kenneſs, to <hi>Dwell with Everlasting Burnings</hi>; as it fared with the <hi>Rich man</hi> in the Goſpel, of whom it is recorded in Scripture, that Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in the greateſt Splendour, and the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of all good things whatever his heart cou'd deſire, he in the midſt of all his Plenty, Died, and was <hi>turned into Hell</hi>; where we af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards find him crying out, and begging earneſtly for one drop of Water <hi>to Cool</hi> his Scorched <hi>Tongue,</hi> and to extinguiſh the Flames
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000833_0016_0FAB40BFEB800068"/>
that occaſioned his Pain; and yet he cou'd not with all his Entreaties and Tears, nor with all his former Riches neither, (ſuppoſing he might have been reſtored once more to the Poſſeſſion of them) purchaſe one Minutes ceſſation from Torment, or ſo much as a drop of Water to allay it.</p>
            <p>I mention theſe things to repreſent to you, as faithfully as I can, the Uncertainty, Empti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and inconſiderable Vanity of our preſent State; that ſo you may divert your Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and Mind from it, and find a more proper Entertainment for them in preparing for a New <hi>Scene,</hi> a New and Laſting <hi>Scene,</hi> to be Shortly enter'd on; Laſting as the vaſt incommenſurate Space of Eternity; and New as well becauſe we are Strangers to it yet, as that it will not Commence till our <hi>Acting</hi> here is ended.</p>
            <p>But here it may not be amiſs to conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der further, that over and above this frailty (hitherto Chiefly diſcours't of) which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geneal with us, and proceeds immediately from the very Principles of our Conſtituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, there are innumerable accidental Caſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that may happen to Come from abroad, and bring Deſtruction along with them.</p>
            <p>So that let a man be temperate, and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

and chaſt, and not given to any of thoſe Vices, which in their own Nature, haſten Death; yet even then he cannot be ſecure with reſpect to his Temporal Safety; though to his great Comfort his Spiritual Part be out of Danger. The beſt of men are liable to deſperate Chances, and though theſe do not happen to <hi>All,</hi> yet <hi>all</hi> are in danger of them. And therefore the Queſtion which the Apoſtle puts in the caſe of the Reſurrection, is no leſs applicable to this, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15.30. Elſe (ſaith he) <hi>Why Stand we in Jeopardy every Hour? i e.</hi> in conſtant Dread of ſome Unſeen Accident or other that may befal us, and preſently end our days, before we can be ſenſible of what has happened; or perceive by what means the Affliction came.</p>
            <p>But if you be of Opinion, that all thoſe Diſquiets and Fears are the Effect of a deep Melancholly, or a diſturbed Imagination; ſuch as ha' no Foundation in Nature, but are groundleſs and unreaſonable (which yet no man of Wiſdom or Sobriety can be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to think.) I ſhall take no other Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod to convince you, ſave only to deſire you to examine your Memories, how fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently you have both heard and read of many Excellent and Worthy Perſons that ha' been either Murthered, or Drown'd or Poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon'd,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:000833_0018_0FAB40C1696B7C30"/>
or even by more uncouth and ſtrange Misfortunes then theſe brought to an Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timely Death.</p>
            <p>There are many Undeniable Inſtances of this kind to be met with in <hi>Holy Scripture.</hi> Shall I put you in Mind of <hi>Abel,</hi> who (the Sacred Story tells us) received a Sudden but Mortal Wound from the bloody Hands of his own cruel Brother, and that for no other reaſon for ought we can find, but becauſe He and his Offering were reſpected by God? Or ſhall I bring to your Remembrance the Violent diſpatch of <hi>Abner</hi> the Renowned Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of <hi>Sauls</hi> Hoſt, <hi>Whom Joab took aſide in the Gate, to ſpeak with him quietly and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and ſmote him under the Fifth Rib, that he died, as a Fool dieth</hi>; nay, <hi>as a man falleth before Wicked men:</hi> So fell this Great and Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous General. In the 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 3 <hi>Chap.</hi> is the whole Relation to be found, which you may peruſe at your leiſure. In the like manner, I may ask you, if you never read how <hi>Uz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>za</hi> was ſmote down dead upon the place, becauſe he endeavoured to hold up the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteady Ark from falling? 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> 13.9, 10. How all the innocent <hi>Children from two years Old and Under, that were in Bethlehem, and in all the Coaſts thereof,</hi> fell in one night a Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the Malice and Cruelty of an en<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>raged <hi>Tyrant</hi>? St. <hi>Math.</hi> 2.16. Or laſtly, how
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:000833_0019_0FAB40C22929A8A0"/>
(not long after that Execrable <hi>Tragical</hi> Mur<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther was committed on the poor <hi>Infants,</hi> who had neither deſerv'd, nor cou'd hinder the Villanous Execution) <hi>John Baptist</hi> was Beheaded by the Command of the ſame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable Perſecuter. Thus while the <hi>Good man</hi> was Preaching Repentance, and endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to Save the <hi>Lives of others,</hi> his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Auditors deprived him of <hi>his own.</hi> verſ. 20.</p>
            <p>There might be produced, were it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, a Multitude of ſuch like Examples; and too frequent Inſtances of Excellent Men, who have thus by ſome unthought of Calamity, or other, been ſpeedily and without Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; tranſlated from a <hi>bad</hi> to a <hi>better</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion.</p>
            <p>And here we are not to imagine that theſe Hiſtorical Relations are now imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, becauſe of a very ancient ſtanding; and that they do not at all concern us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe we are removed ſo many Centuries from the reſpective Times when thoſe ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rall Facts were committed; for 'tis the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles affirmation, <hi>Whatſoever things were writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten aforetime, were written for our learning.</hi> Rom. 15.4.</p>
            <p>But the truth is, 'tis no rare infrequent
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:000833_0020_0FAB40C2E92E5FA8"/>
thing for good men to be catcht away on a ſudden, even in theſe latter days: what the <hi>Wiſe man</hi> ſays in another Caſe, I may ſay in this, <hi>It is an evil that I have ſeen un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Sun, and it is common among Men.</hi> Nay, not among the Vicious and Prophane only, but even the better and more Religious ſort of them.</p>
            <p>And yet granting for once, what howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver can't be allow'd that there are few or no Modern Examples of theſe diſcernable Misfortunes, yet (we know) whatſoever has been, may be; and ſurely if an Ill thing may betide any, and does frequently betide ſome, then every one is inſecure.</p>
            <p>So that they are extreamly to blame (if any ſuch there be) who tho' they can't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny the Truth and Reality of the Obſervation in <hi>Former</hi> Ages, have yet the Confidence to preſume on an Indemnity in the <hi>Preſent</hi>; Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially conſidering that the World as it grows in Age, ſo it decayeth in Strength, and wax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth worſe and worſe every day; and ſeeing this is no leſs true of every particular thing in Nature, then of Nature it ſelf: From hence it is but reaſonable to infer that we who come upon the <hi>Stage</hi> towards the Concluſion, and live in the declining State of the World, ſhould be obnoxious to as <hi>many</hi> if not <hi>more</hi>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:000833_0021_0FAB40C3A9A05388"/>
Evils, and Miſchiefs, and ſudden Deaths then thoſe were liable to, who came on the <hi>Stage</hi> very early, and acted but one or two <hi>Scenes,</hi> while as yet Sin the Curſed Patent of all, had not Exerted its Power and Impire ſo prodigiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nor ſo miſerably Enſlav'd Mankind as it has done of Late; nor perhaps did Mankind (the more is our ſhame) ſo tamely and Univerſally ſubmit.</p>
            <p>Let therefore thoſe who look back on the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals of Antiquity be ſo far from thinking (if common Experience do not preclude ſuch a Thought) that the things we ſpeak of are out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated, that they ſhou'd make an Experiment of the Truth of them (as far as poſſible) upon themſelves by <hi>Dying Daily, i. e.</hi> by providing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Death, and looking conſtantly for him every day, one after another, that ſo the main Chance may be ſecured whatever happen, and that whether he Steals in, and lays his cold hands on them e're they perceive it, or whether he knocks before hand at their Doors, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moniſheth them of his coming for them by and by, they may have no Buſineſs lying on their Hands to diſpatch, no Will to make, nor Affairs to Settle in this World, nor any Accounts to make ready for a Future; yea, indeed not any thing to do, but to thank God for diſcharging them from a troubleſome hazardous Condition ſo ſoon, which they are now to Exchange for an
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:000833_0022_0FAB40C46AE78D10"/>
Unchangeable Happineſs, for a continuance in the Preſence of God, and Converſation with Glorious Angels and Glorified Saints above, and ſo with a chearful and ready Complyance to embrace the Opportunity of <hi>Departing in Peace.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And now, 'tis no doubt expected, I ſhou'd diſcourſe ſomething concerning the Party De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceas't. I am not ignorant this Employment is not without Peril, as has been long ago obſerv'd; for Friends, and thoſe that Lov'd their Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry will think <hi>too Little,</hi> when others, either out of Ignorance or Envy will think <hi>too much</hi> is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; and I may on the <hi>One</hi> Hand be blamed for <hi>Partiality,</hi> and on the <hi>Other</hi> be charged with <hi>Flattery.</hi> And indeed it may be ſometimes Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to be Sparing in ſuch Exerciſes, referring the Commendation of the Dead to the Words of <hi>Solomon, Let her own Works praiſe her.</hi> But nevertheleſs it cannot be denied but that this Ceremony is both ancient and imitable, as might be plentifully prov'd from Scripture, and the Writings of the Ancient Fathers. So that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the Infirmities of Chriſtians ought to be buried, yet the Memorial of their Virtues is a Part of that civil Honour which we owe to thoſe who are departed this Life, and are at <hi>Reſt with God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But then it cannot be reaſonably expected, that I ſhou'd diſcourſe <hi>much</hi> of One whom I but
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000833_0023_0FAB40C52B6B3C00"/>
               <hi>lately knew,</hi> or relate ancient Paſſages of her <hi>Life,</hi> when mine Acquaintance was but of a Modern Date.</p>
            <p>But ſince her coming to this place, I muſt confeſs, I obſerv'd in Her a Kind and Affable and Virtuous Demeanour; and I charitably conclude a Vital Principle of true Piety and Virtue; a Love to God and Religion, and attendance on the Sacrament and other <hi>Means of Grace.</hi> During the Time of her Sickneſs, let none Uncharitably, and Unchriſtianly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute that to the <hi>Perſon,</hi> which was juſtly char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geable on the <hi>Diſeaſe</hi>: I'm ſure while I atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, ſhe manifeſted a Patient and Contented Frame of Spirit under Gods afflicting Hand, earneſtly deſired <hi>my conſtant Prayers for Her; told me ſhe was very ready to reſign her ſelf to Gods diſpoſal, and willing to Dy, if it pleaſed God, ſhe ſhou'd ſo now,</hi> ſtill praying to the laſt, that Almighty God wou'd Pitty and Pardon Her. And ſoon after my Departure, calmly and eaſily, without thoſe Struglings and Ago<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies that ſome Deaths are attended with, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned up her Spirit to God that Gave it, and as (I charitably Conclude, is now Entered into <hi>Reſt,</hi> and Lodged in the Manſions of the <hi>Bleſſed.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What then remains, but that we all <hi>Redeem the Time</hi>; earneſtly beg of God, <hi>to teach us
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:000833_0024_0FAB40C69A76EAE8"/>
ſo to number our days, that we may apply our Hearts to wiſdom</hi>; and Vigorouſly and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly reſolve and endeavour by the Grace of God to lead ſuch Pious and Virtuous Lives in this World, that we may at the Period of this Mortal Life, arrive to the Fruition of that <hi>Fulneſs of Joy</hi> and ineſtable <hi>Pleaſures</hi> that are <hi>at Gods Right-hand for Evermore.</hi>
