            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE treatiſe of which the following is an extract, was written in the German language, about two hundred and fifty years ago, and ſince tranſlated into the French.— Tho' the reader is not to expect elegancy of language, in writings of that age; yet, it is thought, the plainneſs and honeſt ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of the author, who had ſolely the amendment of the hearts of his readers in view; and the divine unction which attends his writings, will make it acceptable and profitable to the awakened, unprejudiced inquirers, of every religious denomination.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt ages of chriſtianity, humility and contrition of heart towards God, and love towards men, were taught to be the moſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable ſacrifice; and a compliance with thoſe practical precepts ſo ſtrongly enjoined, by our Saviour, was looked upon as the foundation of true diſcipleſhip and certain teſt of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to him, <hi>John</hi> xiv. 15. <hi>If ye love me</hi> (ſaith this bleſſed Redeemer), <hi>keep my commandments.</hi> John xv. 14. <hi>Ye are my friends, if ye do what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever I command you.</hi> Again, <hi>John</hi> xv. 8. <hi>Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in is my heavenly Father glorified, that ye bring forth much good fruit.</hi> And that none might

miſtake the true way to everlaſting life, he concludes the precepts he delivered con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it, with theſe remarkable words, <hi>Mat.</hi> vii. 24.—<hi>Whoſoever heareth theſe ſayings of mine, and doth them, I will liken him unto a wiſe man, who built his houſe upon a rock,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>This continued to be the ſtate of the church, till in after-ages the life of religion having much declined, the plain belief and practice of piety, founded ſolely on the power of the goſpel, fell to decay; in the place of which pomp and ſhew, ſtrange modes of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip and confuſed and dark opinions, till then unknown in the church, were introduced; the teachers and leaders aſſumed an autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and reſpect from their offices, which before was paid only to their virtues. Hence diviſions and contentions enſued, by which that pure charity, which before had united and adorned the chriſtian church, was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually loſt to the generality of profeſſors. Nevertheleſs true religion ſtill remains to this day, to be the power of God to ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, changing and purifying the heart, and bringing it into true contrition and a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive reſignation to the will of God. This has, ever, been found to be the effect of its operation on all thoſe, who by devoting themſelves to God, are become the true fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers and diſciples of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the many inſtances of this kind,

which might be mentioned, a particular one appeared, ſome years ago, in theſe parts, thro' the effectual workings of grace, on a number of our neighbouring Indians. Theſe people were very earneſt for the promotion of piety among themſelves, which they ap<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>prehended to be the effect of an inward work, whereby the heart became changed from bad to good <note n="*" place="bottom">

                     </note>. When they were ſolicited to join the other Indians in the war againſt the Engliſh, they abſolutely refuſed, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever might be the conſequence to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, even if the fighting Indians ſhould make <hi>ſlaves,</hi> or as they expreſſed it, <hi>negroes of them,</hi> rendering this reaſon for it, <hi>That when God made men, he did not intend they ſhould hurt or kill one another.</hi> Upon being farther converſed with, in reſpect to their religious proſpect, he who had been the principal inſtrument in raiſing them to a ſenſe of good, gave in ſubſtance, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accounts. That being by a particular providence brought under difficulty and ſorrow, he was led into a deep conſideration of the ſtate of things in the world, when ſeeing the folly and wickedneſs which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:013145_0005_0F8EC33CA2E15240"/>
amongſt men, his ſorrows encreaſed. Nevertheleſs, being impreſſed with a belief that there was a great power, who had cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated all things, his mind was turned from beholding this lower world, to look towards him who had created it, and ſtrong deſires were begot in his heart for a further know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Creator. He was then made ſenſible, that evil not only prevailed in the world, but that he himſelf partook much of its baneful influence, and he at laſt found that his own heart was bad and hard. Upon this great dejection and trouble ſeized his mind, with an inquiry, What would become of his ſoul? In this ſituation he cried unto that powerful Being who he was ſenſible had made the heart of man; and after a long time of ſorrow and perſeverance in ſeeking for help, God was pleaſed to reveal himſelf to his mind, and to put his goodneſs in his heart:—He found he was, as he expreſſed it, raiſed above himſelf and above the world, and felt that his heart had undergone ſome great change; the hardneſs and badneſs he had ſo long groaned under, was taken away,<note n="*" place="bottom">

he found ſo much love to prevail in it, to all men, that he thought he could bear with their revilings and abuſes without reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, appearing ſenſible that as the hearts of all men were bad and hard, till God made them good; the ill uſage he received from them, proceeded from the ſame evil ſeed under which he himſelf had ſo long groaned. This ſenſe of the corruption of the human heart, accompanied with a conſtant applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to his Maker, to take away the bad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and hardneſs of the heart, and make it ſoft and good, was what he called religion; and what, upon feeling the power of God to his comfort in his heart, he was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to exhort his brethren to ſeek the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of, in themſelves. And farther ſaid, that under this diſpenſation he was made ſenſible that the ſpirit of religion, was a ſpirit of love, which led thoſe who obeyed it, into love to all men <note n="*" place="bottom">That this Indian had a true proſpect of the happy effect of the power of the goſpel-ſtate, upon thoſe who ſubmit to its requirings, appears from many parts of ſcripture, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly from the propheſy of the evangelick prophet, <hi>Iſa. chap. xxxv. 1—9.</hi> 
                        <q>The wilderneſs and the ſolitary places ſhall be glad for them, and the deſerts ſhall rejoice, and bloſſom as the roſe:</q>—It ſhall bloſſom abundantly and rejoice even with joy and ſinging.—They ſhall ſee the glory of the Lord and the excellency of our God.—An high way ſhall be there, and it ſhall be called the way of holineſs. The way-fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing men, though fools, ſhall not err therein. No lion ſhall be there, nor any ravenous beaſts ſhall go up thereon, it ſhall not be found there; but the redeemed ſhall walk there. <hi>Chap. lx. 17.</hi> I will make thy officers peace, and thine exactors righteouſneſs; violence ſhall no more be heard in the land, nor deſtruction within thy borders; but thou ſhall call thy wall ſalvation, and thy gates praiſe.</note>; but that men not keeping
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:013145_0006_0F8EC33DC02D5578"/>
to this ſpirit of love, an oppoſite ſpirit got entrance, in their hearts; that it was from hence, that aroſe all thoſe diſorders which ſo much prevail amongſt men. That he was alſo ſenſible there was ſtill an evil ſpirit la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring to get the maſtery in his heart, in oppoſition to the goſpel ſpirit; but that thoſe who had been viſited by a power from God, and were obedient to the degree of light and love, he was pleaſed to favour them with, would be more and more ſtrengthened and eſtabliſhed therein. He had alſo a proſpect of the neceſſity of that baptiſm of ſpirit and fire which the ſcriptures and the experience of the faithful, in all ages, have teſtified every true diſciple of Chriſt muſt undergo; whereby, thro' mortification, and death to ſelf, the root of ſin is deſtroyed. This he deſcribed by the proſpect he had of ſomething, like as an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward fire would be to the natural body; which he muſt paſs thro' in order to attain to that purity of heart he deſired to attain. He farther obſerved, that whilſt he was anxiouſly beholding this fire, he ſaw a very ſmall path cloſe to the fire, by walking in
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:013145_0006_0F8EC33DC02D5578"/>
which, he might go round the fire, and the painful tryal be avoided.—This he underſtood to repreſent the way by which thoſe who were eſteemed wiſe had ſound means to avoid that probation they ought to have paſſed thro' and yet retained a name amongſt men, as though they had been puri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by it. Thus this Indian, untaught by books and unlearned in what is called divinity, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained the myſtery of godlineſs in a plain and ſenſible manner, and in that child-like ſimplicity, which our Saviour recommends as the badge of acceptance with God. This is the wiſdom which on account of its plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſimplicity, has in all ages been hid from the wiſe and prudent, and revealed only to babes, who in honeſt ſincerity of heart look ſolely to God in their diſtreſs.</p>
                  <p>Another inſtance of the like kind, has lately appeared in the caſe of the converſion of a conſiderable number of the Indian natives of Greenland <note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>David Grantz's</hi> Hiſtory of Greenland, printed 176.</note>. Thoſe people were, during a long time, ſtrongly ſolicited to become converts to chriſtianity but with little or no ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>As long as the poor natives had no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception nor feeling of the corruption of their hearts; nor any longing for a better condition, but only apprehended chriſtiani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

to conſiſt in the repetition of creeds and confeſſions of truths contained in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, little or no impreſſion was made upon them. But as ſoon, as they became ſenſible of the corruption and hardneſs of their hearts, and believed the publication of the goſpel, to contain in it itſelf, a power thro' which they might be delivered from that burden of ſin and corruption which lay upon them, they embraced it with joy, and crying to God for power, many became the objects of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming grace; experiencing the ſtony heart to be taken away, and a heart of fleſh to be given them. And indeed the grace which prevailed amongſt theſe ſimple, ignorant people, was cauſe of amazement, and ſuch as muſt, by its ſurprizing effect, oblige peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to riſe to the firſt cauſe, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge it could not proceed but from God alone. The author of the hiſtory, who was on the ſpot, obſerves, that he could not help thinking that thoſe ſceptics, who incline to doubt of every thing, which their reaſon cannot comprehend, and who deny the effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the grace, or at leaſt judge it inſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient, towards effecting a total change of the minds and morals of men, might be clearly convinced of their error, in behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe Indians, who had been born and brought up in an uncontrouled licence, like wild beaſts, deſtitute of education, totally

                  <p>From theſe and many more inſtances which might be given, it evidently appears, that the goſpel is the power of God to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation in all thoſe who believe, and in honeſt ſimplicity of heart reſign themſelves up to God <note n="*" place="bottom">

                  <head>THE AUTHOR's PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE narrow path which leads to chriſtian perfection, doth not conſiſt in the attainment of much knowledge, neither in ſubtility of argument, nor yet in the practice of many outward works: but it conſiſts in this, that through grace we crucify our fleſh, with all its ſins and diſorderly affections, reſign ourſelves with ſubmiſſion to the will of God in all things, and patiently bear with the ſlights and abuſes which may befal us from our fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low men. That we daily take up our croſs, and follow our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in his life and ſufferings, and in the love of our enemies: It alſo requires that we renounce all inordinate love of parents, children, or friends; and that the love
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:013145_0009_0F8EC34266382248"/>
and deſire of riches and other earthly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lights be mortified in us: Thus we may attain to purity of heart, and be enabled to love the Lord our God, with all our hearts, with all our ſouls and ſtrength, and our neighbour as ourſelves, <hi>Mat.</hi> xxii. 37, 38. But this narrow and infallible path is become ſo deſert, and ſo much ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected, and the love of God waxed ſo cold, that there are very few who are found walking therein. People are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally looking towards ſenſible objects, their principal deſire being that their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural appetites, their covetouſneſs, and their luſts may be ſatisfied: Too many being content with knowing, but not complying with, their Maſter's Will.</p>
                  <p>The reader will find in this abſtract, a ſummary of the chriſtian religion, and of the means whereby we may attain to that purity of heart and intimate union with God, to which we all are called, and for which we were created.</p>
                  <p>If this little book ſhould, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning appear too cloſe and ſevere; never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs let the reader take courage and beg for divine help, and if he perſeveres in doing that which God will manifeſt in his heart to be his duty; he will infallibly meet with divine aid.</p>

                     <hi>CHAPTER I.</hi> Wherein is ſhewn, that if we are deſirous to live a truly chriſtian life, we muſt die unto ſin, and withdraw our affections from the creatures.</head>
                  <p>EVERY perſon who ſincerely deſires to be converted to God, muſt, thro' di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine help, begin by forſaking all groſs ſins, and dying to every vicious inclination, ſuch as pride, impurity, anger, covetouſneſs, hatred, ſelf-love, &amp;c. and to all other ſins, which are committed in thought, word or action. We muſt turn away from all ſenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al pleaſures, renounce our attachment and dependance on the creatures, and from eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing that tends to encreaſe our natural corruption, and attachment to the world and the things of it, and every thing where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the good pleaſure and ſervice of God is not our principal aim. We ought alſo, to be careful not to ſuffer our affections to fix on particular perſons, as we are too eaſily led aſide, by conforming to other people's natural diſpoſitions; but let our regard be to all men, even as the ſun equally enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the evil and the good, <hi>Mat.</hi> v. 45. All thoſe good things which God in his provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013145_0010_0F8EC34351830458"/>
favours us with, ſhould be uſed with diſcretion for neceſſities, but by no means, to indulge our fleſhly appetites and deſires, either in eating, drinking, ſleeping, or other corporeal wants.</p>
                  <p>And when we are thus diſpoſed, we may be aſſured God will freely afford every ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary ſupply, in order to enable us to ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fil the duties he requires of us.</p>
                  <p>If we ſincerely deſire to love God, we muſt, with fervent and humble ſighs, beg for di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine help, carefully watch over our thoughts, words and actions, in whatever we ſee, do or omit, upon all that paſſes both within and without us, ſhunning, with the greateſt care, all occaſions of ſin, ſuch as needleſs company, idle converſation, &amp;c. &amp;c. ſo as continually to keep our hearts in the fear of God, which is as a fountain of ſpiritual ſtrength, with the eye of the mind bent to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards him in reverence and love. For he who neglects theſe divine and powerful ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, will be left as a city open on all ſides, and become a prey to worldly mindedneſs and ſenſuality, and will finally be brought to ruin. For this reaſon we muſt exert our utmoſt ſtrength againſt thoſe things which we are ſenſible have the greateſt hold of our affections, that our hearts being preſerved in liberty, ſimplicity and purity, free from agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013145_0010_0F8EC34351830458"/>
and uneaſineſs, may not become a prey to any of thoſe evil deſires, ſo apt to diſſipate the ſpirit and engroſs the affections. Thus may we, thro' timely care, overcome all temptations; for he that is not careful to avoid ſmall evils, will gradually fall into greater, in which the farther he ſinks, the more difficult will his converſion to God be.</p>
                  <p>Let us be particularly careful to ſhun all occaſion of ſuperfluous diſcourſe, and watch over our words, that we utter nothing but what may tend to the glory of God, or the good of our neighbour. Our bleſſed Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our himſelf has declared, <hi>"That in the day of Judgment we muſt give an account for every idle word."</hi> Mat. xii. 36. wherefore when we ſpeak, let it be done with an heart full of charity; in meekneſs of expreſſion, and with deep humility.</p>
                  <p>Endeavour to avoid all occaſions of ſtrife, rather ſuffer loſs than contend. Maintain thy peace with God, and be careful not to give occaſion of ſtumbling to any one. Have alſo a ſpecial care over thy eyes, for it is by them thou art drawn into temptation, and expoſed to many hurtful ſnares.</p>
                  <p>In all tryals and contradictions look up to God, earneſtly begging for ſtrength, courage and patience; ſo thou mayſt, by perſevering in the exerciſe of virtue, be enabled to bring thy body in ſubjection, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> ix. 27.
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013145_0011_0F8EC34364F2EC60"/>
Thoſe who practice theſe precepts have good reaſon to hope that the ſpirit of God will abide with and operate in them, and that often in a wonderful manner.</p>
                  <p>The operation of the divine power is much prevented, and the love of God extinguiſhed in us, by thoſe ſins which we, knowingly, ſuffer to prevail over us; ſuch as pride, hatred, preſumption, ſelf-will, evil deſires, and an unwarrantable attachment to chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren and relations; the deſire of riches, of a name amongſt men, wrong indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in the gratification of our appetites, and the like, which carry our thoughts and affections away from God, and to which our hearts are ſo attached, that we are not able to free ourſelves from them, nor forſake them, for the love of God's ſake. Here the creatures are poſſeſſed of that ſeat which God ought to occupy in the heart. Alas! how many things do we ſuffer to take hold of our minds, and how many things have we in our intentions to do, wherein we nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſee nor ſeek God; thus it is that the meaſure of our ſins are filling up, and that ſo many people are ſo long conſumed by the fire of a troubled conſcience, and will finally be caſt into eternal ſufferings, if they die without repentance.</p>
                  <p>There is a ſtrong will in moſt people to live in a manner agreeable to their natural
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013145_0011_0F8EC34364F2EC60"/>
will, to gather abundance of wealth, and live in affluence, without ever making ſincere and upright inquiry whether their conduct is agreeable to God, or tends to his glory.</p>
                  <p>There are others who appear virtuous in the ſight of men, yet are ſtill under the power of evil habits, which they conclude to be but ſmall failings, not thinking them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound to forſake them, but look upon their ſtate as good, becauſe they abſtain from groſs ſins; nevertheleſs, theſe people not being willing to give up their hearts wholly to God, the work of religion is hindred; and theſe very trifles which they indulge themſelves in, and of which they think God takes no account, become a wall of ſeparation between God and them. Theſe, tho' they apprehend themſelves ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, yet are walking as on the very brink of hell, and frequently fall into ſuch grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous ſins as border on deſtruction. Ah! how great will the lamentation of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite number of theſe kind of people be at the laſt day, when the thoughts of all hearts will be laid open, and every one ſhall clearly ſee whether in the courſe of their lives they have choſen to ſerve God or themſelves. But how few are affected with theſe things; moſt men are, as it were, ſunk into a deep lethargic ſtate of mind, heedleſs of the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013145_0012_0F8EC344421274E0"/>
dangers that ſurround them, which, if they were ſenſible of, would raiſe ſuch deep diſtreſs of mind within them, as would not allow them reſt day or night till they were delivered from this deplorable condition.</p>
                  <p>As to thoſe failings which ſometimes pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail in perſons otherwiſe ſincerely diſpoſed to pleaſe God, which proceed from weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and are not the effect of an unwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantable attachment to the creatures, but happen thro' ſurpriſe, or that weakneſs ſo prevalent in our nature, ſuch as ſudden anger, indiſcreet expreſſions, or the like, they are not ſo hurtful as when they are the effect of indulgence or habit; the ground of the heart of ſuch being good, when ever they are made ſenſible of their fault, they are ready to condemn themſelves with true humility, and, from a lively ſenſe of their weakneſs, to implore the divine mercy to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> that which is very prejudicial to us, and prevents our being poſſeſſed with a true love to God, is a deſire which prevails in many people to ſerve both God and the creatures at one and the ſame time; this is very hurtful to them, and prevents their being poſſeſſed of a true love to God: this the lip of truth has declared to be impoſſible, <hi>Mat.</hi> vi. 24. For in that degree that the heart is ſuffered to be filled with the love of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013145_0012_0F8EC344421274E0"/>
the creatures, in that degree it is emptied of God and of his grace.</p>
                  <p>We muſt ſuffer ourſelves to be ſtripped from all love and ſolicitude after terreſtrial things, 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> v. 7. and be habituated, even from our youth, to ſerve God in ſpirit and truth, if we are deſirous to rejoice in old age. It muſt be allowed that the beginning is difficult, but, thro' divine help, all things will become eaſy. Our kingdom is not of this world, <hi>John</hi> xviii. 36. therefore we may at leaſt take as much pains and expoſe ourſelves to as much inconveniency for the attainment thereof, which conſiſts in the knowledge of, and an union with, God, as an infinite number of people do to poſſeſs thoſe honours and delights which belong to this world, and which are ſought after by its votaries with ſo much labour, patience and danger.</p>

                  <p>The truly humble ſoul who loves God, is always ready to give him the glory which is his due; and, when under a ſight of his own nothingneſs, will freely acknowledge that God's goodneſs is purely the effect of his love to his creatures, as they cannot add to his happineſs. Such a ſoul, from a feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſenſe of his miſery, will freely acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that from its own nature, it is as no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, yea leſs than nothing, being become as a deſiled veſſel, which corrupts every
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013145_0015_0F8EC3466D8AEB98"/>
thing which is poured into it; that he is a child of wrath, and under the curſe, ready every day to fall back into his fearful no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingneſs. Nay, he cannot but acknowledge himſelf ſo filled with evil, and ſo unable to help himſelf, that if God did not continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prevent him, by his grace, he would be liable, each moment, to fall into the moſt enormous ſins, and precipitate himſelf with the devil into eternal fire. In this humble ſtate the ſoul ſenſibly perceives how many ſins it has committed, in thought, word and action; how unfaithful and ungrateful he has been towards ſo good and ſo faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a God, having omitted to ſeek, with ſincerity, his glory to whom alone it is due, and thus miſerably loſt his time; that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs God has been ſo good as to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give his ſins, even ſo fully as never to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member them any more, <hi>Mich.</hi> vii. 3. and to cauſe him to paſs from a life of ſin to a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine life; that thus from an enemy he is become his friend, which is a more excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent work than to have created a world.

humility, we enter into ourſelves, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the wonders which God has diſplay'd in our favour, we muſt acknowledge that we are not only unworthy of the leaſt of his benefits, but that if he ſhould deal with us in the rigour of his juſtice, and according to our deſerts, <hi>Pſ.</hi> cxxx. iii. we could ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect nothing but to experience his juſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation. Under this conſideration we ought patiently and reſignedly to bear every diſpenſation of his will, tho' ever ſo hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, from a ſenſibility that we have no juſt cauſe of complaint, but rather reaſon for continually returning thanks to God for the multiude of his benefits, of which we have been ſuch unworthy receivers, with fervent deſires that the will of God may be done in and by us, and all other creatures, both in time and eternity. In this ſituation a man will eaſily bear to be deſpiſed and reputed what he indeed eſteems himſelf to be. Thoſe who are truly humble are not afraid of being looked upon as unworthy of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour; theſe equally rejoice under the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that juſtice of God which ſuffers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to come upon them, as under the ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of that mercy which will cauſe every thing, even that which may be eſteemed deep afflictions, to work for good to all thoſe who love and fear him.</p>

                     <pb n="16" facs="unknown:013145_0016_0F8EC34724534D18"/>When we contemplate on one hand our own nothingneſs, and on the other view the majeſty of God and his goodneſs ſo abound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in grace and love, it is aſtoniſhing that we are not wholly taken up in the exerciſe of humility, this being the foundation of our perfection, and of that true peace of heart which it is out of the reach and power of any creature to diſturb.</p>
                  <p>Many are the ſtraits and difficulties to which we are reduced, and the temptations and frailties under which we are liable to fall; but when any thing of this afflictive nature is ſuffered to attend, if we did but ſink into our nothingneſs, we might, thro' divine help, ſuffer the whole vehemence of the ſtorm to fall on us, without hurting of us; for if the devil, and all the creatures, ſhould fall on us, in this humble reſigned ſtate, they would not hurt us, but all would work for our good, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 18. When a man thus ſinks into his nothingneſs, thro' an humble reſignation and ſubmiſſion to God, and for his ſake humbles himſelf be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore men, God will neceſſarily be united to him; for tho' God is as nothing to man, yet he is not ſo in himſelf, he is the Jehovah, in whom are all things; yet he is as nothing with reſpect to the creatures, whilſt their thoughts do not tend to this ſovereign good, as is written, <hi>Pſ.</hi> xliii. <q>
                        <hi>The fool has ſaid in
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013145_0016_0F8EC34724534D18"/>
his heart there is no God.</hi>
                     </q> Wherefore when we are in a ſtate of true contrition, from a ſenſe of our nothingneſs, with reſpect to God, we muſt be obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge the nothingneſs of all our works, and that tho' God has ſo long been as nothing to us, yet we muſt, in eternity, be ſomething to God, in his wrath, except we become ſomething to him in time, thro' Jeſus Chriſt. This is the thing principally neceſſary, that thou know thyſelf, and the neceſſity thou art under to refrain from a purſuit after vain ſcience and needleſs la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, avoiding all diſputes and ſolicitude af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter earthly things, but carefully make thy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf fully acquainted with the virtue of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, and thou wilt be wiſe and learned enough; for the excellency of humility, and the favours and grace it draws down from God is ſo great, that the tongue of man can ſcarcely utter it to the full.</p>
                  <p>In a truly humble ſtate we remain empty and paſſive before God, as an inſtrument or tool, which ſuffers itſelf to be handled and led by the hand of God juſt as it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good unto the maſter workman.</p>
                  <p>A perſon thus humbled, receives all things as coming immediately from the hands of God, <hi>Lament.</hi> iii. 37.38. looking upon himſelf as unworthy of the leaſt favour; if ſick, or in any other afflicting diſpenſation,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013145_0017_0F8EC347DE98BF98"/>
he accepts of his ſickneſs and trouble as a meſſenger ſent from God for his good, thanks him for it, making this very afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion an occaſion of awakening his zeal for his ſervice. If deſpiſed, he ſubmits, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he deſerves; if he is in honour, he eſteems himſelf unworthy, humbling himſelf the more on that account; ſo great a ſenſe of his nothingneſs prevails, that he is ready to confeſs himſelf unworthy of all the benefits he has received, and that he has well deſerved all the afflictions and ſufferings which are come upon him.</p>
                  <p>It is by thus ſetting the virtue of humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as a baſis, that we ſhall attain to that which is really and ſubſtantially good.</p>
                  <p>We muſt, with one of old, <hi>Job</hi> xlii. 6. be diſpleaſed with, yea <hi>abhor ourſelves,</hi> before a right amendment will take place in us, for how ſhall I amend in that which does not diſpleaſe me. In every afflictive diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation, there is nothing more effectual than this ſalutary diſlike of ourſelves, <hi>Luke</hi> xv. 21. This will cauſe us to bear in patience the ſlights and ſcorns of men; indeed nothing is of more advantage than thoſe ſlights and afflictions, provided we are capable and willing to make a proper uſe of them.</p>
                  <p>When a man acknowledges both with heart and mouth, that he is full of guilt, and deſerving of eternal death, ſuch a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013145_0017_0F8EC347DE98BF98"/>
acknowledgment goes a great way to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his juſtification and reconciliation with God, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xii. 13. who is always ready to forgive and deliver a truly contrite ſinner; but he that ſaith <hi>He has no ſin, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives himſelf, and the truth is not in him,</hi> 1 John i. 8. Our natural as well as ſpiritual pride is an obſtacle to our receiving abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of divine grace; for in the degree wherein we humble ourſelves, in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree God exalts us; and in the degree that we exalt and love ourſelves, in that degree we are abaſed, <hi>Mat.</hi> xxiii. 12. Nature muſt paſs thro' many deaths, before true humili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty becomes ſo rooted in our hearts that we can bear to be deſpiſed, and that honour from men becomes a burden to us, <hi>Mat.</hi> v. 11.12. There are people who may, in ſome degree, be ſaid to be naturally diſpoſed to humility and other virtues, but God does not eſteem theſe people more holy on that account. He only may be ſaid to be truly humble who, thro' the effect of grace, is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to renounce himſelf, and do the will of God in word and deed, <hi>Mat.</hi> xii. 50. It is not what a man has been, nor the good works he has performed, for God regards ſolely the love he bears, the inclination he has to pleaſe him, thro a pure diſintereſted love. True love to God is never fruitleſs; where ever it dwells it brings forth moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013145_0018_0F8EC34A39E5E258"/>
fruit; where there is no fruit, there is no true love, 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> i. 8. Thus a man may have a natural bent towards what is called virtue, but we are no farther truly virtuous and agreeable to God, than ſo far as we love him, and that is only according to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of our humiliation or willingneſs to die to ourſelves, and all that is eſteemed valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in this world.</p>

                  <p>A MAN muſt intirely renounce his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural will, committing himſelf, and all that he is poſſeſſed of to God's holy will, both in time and eternity, <hi>Mat.</hi> x. 37. carefully attending to the inſpiration of truth, <hi>Heb.</hi> iii. 15. taking up the croſs to his own inclination, to that degree of ability and knowledge which, thro' grace, is af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded him, <hi>John</hi> vi. 65. ſubmitting himſelf to all men, agreeable to the example left us by our Saviour, with humility and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>Pet.</hi> v. 5. cauſing his wilful diſorderly ſpirit to ſubmit, ſaying with the Apoſtle, <hi>Acts</hi> ix. 6. <hi>Lord what wilt thou have me to do.</hi> God, the infinite good, is nearer to each creature than they are to themſelves, <hi>Acts</hi>

xvii. 28. for nothing can happen nor ſubſiſt one moment but thro' his will; wherefore they who are continually reſiſting him, and ſeeking only to fulfil their own wills, are like a troubled ſea, never at reſt, and have nothing to expect but miſery hereafter.—God dwells with him that is of a ſubmiſſive reſigned ſpirit, making him partaker of his grace, and cauſing his peace to flow into his heart. The truly reſigned, meek ſpirited, man has not only to expect happineſs in a life to come, but to him it is began, even, here already, upon earth, for he enjoys ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial comfort, with an aſſurance that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can ſeparate him therefrom, but that all that happens to him will in the end work for his good.</p>
                  <p>True renunciation requires that we chearfully ſubmit our wills to God's will. Our whole ſalvation depends upon our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing brought into the diſpoſition expreſſed, by our dear Saviour, when he ſaid, <hi>Never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs, Father, not my will but thine be done,</hi> Luke xxii. 42. The beſt ſupplication we can offer to God is, <hi>Lord let thy will be done in me; let me be in all things conformable to thy will.</hi> This prayer exceeds all others, and reaches even unto heaven.</p>
                  <p>Ah! how ſweet a ſtate is it to live always in ſubmiſſion to the divine will; to ſeek him in all things, and above all things! A
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013145_0019_0F8EC34B2366E1A8"/>
man who dwells in his ſelfiſhneſs is neither in fellowſhip with God nor his children; what he once undertakes he will not quit or give up; this ſprings from a bottom of pride; he always prefers his own choice; he enjoys no peace, not being diſpoſed to receive God's grace. For diſquiet always ſprings from an indulgence of our own wills. Wherefore, if we deſire peace, the firſt ſtep we ought to take is to ceaſe from all diſorderly love of ourſelves; till then we will not find true freedom, nor be maſters of ourſelves. The world and our other ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies attack us, only thro' ourſelves; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if we have gained a victory over our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, we ſhall have ſubdued all our other enemies. Nothing more worthy of hatred than ſelf-love; this is the cauſe of all our griefs, and this is what hinders us from enjoying God, with all the treaſures of his grace.</p>
                  <p>The leſs we have of ſelfiſhneſs, the more agreeable we are to God, and the more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to receive his grace. As a man who lives in ſelf-love cannot deny himſelf, and had rather lead others, than be led by them; in the ſame manner, a man who has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken all things, is more inclined to ſuffer and follow others, than to command them; for ſuch an one ſeeks to die to all pride, and
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013145_0019_0F8EC34B2366E1A8"/>
God readily compleats his work in him and leads him to perfection.</p>
                  <p>If a man ſhould forſake a kingdom, and all the world, if he cannot renounce himſelf, he has hardly done any thing.</p>
                  <p>Wilt thou know if thou art in the true nothingneſs, if thou art not yet under the dominion of a diſorderly love, obſerve if thou art more moved at thoſe revilings, injuſtice or other accidents, which happen to thyſelf, than thoſe which happen to others. He who is afflicted at the loſs of temporal goods, ſhews thereby that he is unworthy of poſſeſſing them, as claiming them in his own right: Whereas God alone is the true owner and maſter of all. So alſo he who reſents affronts, ſhews that he indeed de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves to be deſpiſed, becauſe he arrogates to himſelf that vengeance which belongs alone to God, and plainly diſcovers that ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and the love of the creatures are yet deeply rooted in his heart.</p>
                  <p>Our Saviour ſays, <hi>Mat.</hi> xvi. 24. <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf,</hi> (that is, his own inclination and will) and <hi>let him take up his croſs and follow me.</hi> This is the infallible way to ſalvation: therefore give diligent heed to thyſelf, in this matter; the ſooner and more thou art in the practice of this eſſential duty, the eaſier it will become to thee. Here it is thou muſt begin, if thou
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013145_0020_0F8EC34C30099B80"/>
deſireſt to attain to any degree of ſolid virtue. In that degree thou renounceth thyſelf, and the creatures; ſo far God will viſit and dwell in thee, by his grace, and thou wilt be enabled to become comformable to him. The more thou dieth to thyſelf, the more thou wilt feel the good ſpirit predominant within thee; for in the degree that thou art unclothed from ſin in the ſelf-ſame degree wilt thou be raiſed up to the love of God, and make advances in the way of holineſs.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore give all, <hi>for all,</hi> ſell all that thou haſt, (i. e. thyſelf) to obtain all, and thou wilt find <hi>that all,</hi> in every thing, and withal a conſtant peace in thy heart, for nothing can alter and affect that peace which has its foundation in God. That happineſs and peace which we are purſuing with ſo much pain and difficulty, whilſt ſelf is only in view, will be abundantly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed on us, if we renounce ourſelves, and fix our love ſolely upon God. We muſt not ſo much look, at what we do, as at what we are; if the bottom of our heart was good, all our deeds would be upright and good; for a heart, whoſe centre is ſanctified and diſpoſed to glorify God is always favoured by him.</p>
                  <p>If we gave up ourſelves and were willing to hazard all, as well that which is within, as that which is from without, we need fear
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013145_0020_0F8EC34C30099B80"/>
no danger, and ſhould poſſeſs true content of ſpirit. There are but few who entirely give themſelves up to the will of God, for no one can ſo fully renounce himſelf, but what he may ſtill find ſomething to renounce, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiii. 10.</p>
                  <p>The Lord's prayer expreſſed, even but once, in true ſelf-denial, for the glory of God, is of more worth than thouſands of prayers proceeding from our own will, and under the dominion of ſelf.</p>
                  <p>An upright man, who endeavours to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce himſelf, in whatever he does, is fixed in God; and God ſo far protects him, that to attack him is in effect to attack God. All that this man does, and all that happens to him, neceſſarily comes from God; hence he enjoys the greateſt delight. Nothing can hurt ſuch a man; ſcorn, injuſtice, the devil, death or hell itſelf, can do him no harm. Hence it appears that ſubmiſſion to the will of God both inward and outward, is the ſhorteſt way to attain to the higheſt pitch of truth and perfection.</p>
                  <p>When a man truly becomes ſo far con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to the will of God, as entirely to renounce himſelf, ceaſing from ſeeking his own honour and advantage; deſiring no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but barely that the honour and good pleaſure of God may, in all things, be eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed; ſuch an one will be freed from the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013145_0021_0F8EC34C90B32198"/>
guilt of his ſins, even tho' they were of the deepeſt dye. For <hi>what a</hi> drop of water is when compared with the ſea; ſuch are the ſins of a truly reſigned penitent man, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the ocean of God's mercy. But this is a mighty work, to be thus entirely given up to do, and ſuffer the will of God; nature will be always ſeeking to ſatisfy her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and is very unwilling, totally, to ſubmit and die.</p>

<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013145_0021_0F8EC34C90B32198"/>
let us demean ourſelves towards all men, in that manner in which we deſire they ſhould act towards us; agreeable to our bleſſed Saviour's injunction, <hi>Mat.</hi> vii. 12. Our hearts ought always to be diſpoſed to ſuccour every man, whom we perceive to be under ſufferings, either of body or mind. We ought to pray, earneſtly, to God, that he would beſtow on us the gifts of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion and brotherly love. If it is in our power to aſſiſt our fellow-creature, either in word or deed, we ought to do it to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt of our power, with a free and willing heart; if much is not in our power, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, let us do what we can, with a lively and ſincere compaſſion: at leaſt give him ſome comfort, and we ſhall find God will alſo extend his mercy to us.</p>
                  <p>It is our duty to reſpect the image of God, and to regard his divine majeſty in all men, and without delay, to uſe our beſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours that every degree of bitterneſs or ſlight may be removed out of our hearts, which may have inſenſibly ſlipped into them, againſt any perſon, whether high or low, rich or poor, for God is no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpector of perſons. Let us forgive and not condemn others, as we deſire God ſhould alſo forgive and not condemn us. We ought always to keep a ſevere eye on ourſelves, not eſteeming ourſelves above

meaſure, rather magnifying than extenu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our own failing: On the other hard we ſhould look with tenderneſs and compaſſion on the failings of our neighbours; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring to behold them with an eye of indulgence; and let us be particularly careful never to ſpeak evil of any in their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, <hi>James</hi> iv. 11.

Thus endeavouring to make the beſt of things.</p>
                  <p>Some people are ſo much inclined to judge, that they are always ready to cenſure and correct others; theſe inſtead of repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, are often loſt and do great hurt to thoſe that hear them, by raiſing in their minds a ſlight and ſcorn of their neighbours; this generally proceeds from pride and an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warrantable eſteem of themſelves.

wiſdom of God to guide him, in order to bring him to a participation of his grace. And ſhall ſuch a poor worm be weak enough to think, that, that which is only known of God, muſt be conducted agreeable to thy fancy; hence thou haſt reaſon to bluſh, as before God and his ſaints.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who preſume to judge, in matters which God has reſerved to himſelf, draw on themſelves unexpreſſible evil.

and hereupon abandon thyſelf to him, with a true faith and confidence in his holy will, and thou wilt experience, that the promiſes of Chriſt will be fulfilled, <hi>viz.</hi> that he will not reject the truly repenting ſinner. And ſhouldeſt thou ſurvive, be careful to watch during the remaining part of thy life, againſt ſin, and ſerve God with all thy power, that on thy death bed, thou mayeſt have a ſenſe of peace and reconciliation with God, which will be of more value to thee than if thou ſhouldeſt gain the whole world.</p>
                  <p>The ſufferings of Chriſt ought not to be meditated on in a ſuperficial manner, but with a lively inward ſenſibility and an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent and conſtant love. If thou can'ſt not do it with tears and dolorous ſight, do it with praiſe and thankfulneſs, under a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of the infinite goodneſs of thy Saviour. And tho' thou can'ſt not attain to ſuch ſenſible feelings as thou deſireſt, and thy heart ſhould remain dry and hard: Yet ceaſe not from ſuch meditation; keep thy mind in ſubmiſſion, and this offerings will be agreeable to God.</p>
                  <p>Thou art not only to conſider thy Saviour as being perfect in holineſs, as a man, but alſo as an Almighty God, who by his word created the heavens and the earth, and who can alſo bring them to nothing: Who, tho' he is infinite and incomprehenſible, has con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:013145_0024_0F8EC34EAE4663C8"/>
to abaſe himſelf ſo far, for the ſake of ſo poor a creature. From this ſight thou oughteſt to be covered with confuſion, in that thou dareſt give way to the leaſt degree of pride. The ſufferings of Chriſt may be conſidered in a three-ſold manner, Firſt, In themſelves, to move us with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, at the ſight of his poverty, his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, his perſecutions, his ſorrows and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful death upon the croſs. Secondly, By his obedience, his patience, his humility and charity, in a word all thoſe virtues which we are called to imitate. Thirdly, In the cauſe of his ſufferings, which was the ardent love he bore to us, which he manifeſted in ſo ſtriking a manner. It was thro' the effect of this love, to us his creatures, that he lived in ſo deſtitute a ſtate, as not to have whereon to lay his head, <hi>Mat.</hi> viii. 20. and finally ended his life in pain, ſo that he ſpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing, but gave up all freely and wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly for us. There is no mortal man who has ſo vehement a deſire for life as Jeſus Chriſt had to redeem ſinners, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them from that ſin, by which they had ſeparated themſelves from him. Ought not this conſideration to incite us to reciprocal love towards him. It is ſurprizing, that the conſideration of our Saviour's moſt bitter ſufferings, doth not inflame our hearts with his love, and penetrate even to the very
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:013145_0025_0F8EC34F7770FE40"/>
bottom of our ſouls. But none do teſtify more gratitude to God, nor compaſſion for the ſufferings of our Saviour, than he who labours to imitate him; this is as agreeable to God, as if we gave our life for him. If we ſubmit to his croſs, either outwardly or inwardly, this will cauſe our proud ſpirit to bend, under his <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> of thorns, and our ſufferings will produce living fruit in us.</p>
                  <p>If thou art really deſirous to manifeſt thy gratitude for the infinite goodneſs of God, and to bear in thy body the marks of the dying of the Lord Jeſus, before the world, and in the face of the celeſtial armies, <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 17. thou muſt ſubmit to God, without reſerve; thou muſt die to thy wandering eyes, thy curious ears, thy vain talk, and to all thy fleſhly luſts, <hi>Col.</hi> iii. 5. thus wilt thy feet be, as it were, nailed to the croſs. Neither thy ſpiritual nor thy corporeal ſtrength muſt be overcome by ſloth, but thou muſt, agreeable to the example of Chriſt, ſuffer thy arms to be extended in the ſervice of God; and thy body to perſevere in ſpiritual exerciſes for the glory of thy Redeemer, and to fulfil his will. Thoſe ſpiritual ſufferings, thro' which thou finds thyſelf ſo preſſed, ought to drive thee towards the Lord, then wilt thou ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear as it were clothed with his righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and lovely in the ſight of God and his holy angels. Thy willingneſs to ſuffer,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:013145_0025_0F8EC34F7770FE40"/>
ought to be as a bed for thy Saviour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe himſelf on: Thy reſiſtance againſt ſin, and thy efforts to ſurmount thy evil nature will rejoice his ſpirit, and thy prayers allay his grief.</p>
                  <p>And if when thou haſt done to the beſt of thy power, and art nevertheleſs deſpiſed, abuſed, perſecuted, and ranked with ſinners, and thereby brought thee more to die to thyſelf; and that thou freely forgives and prays for thoſe who abuſe thee, then art thou, indeed, with Chriſt under his croſs. When thou art willing to be deprived of thy friends and of all that can be as a wall of ſeparation between God and thee, it is then thou (as it were) helps thy Saviour to bear his croſs. When God will permit thee to be deprived of all comfort; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in an inward dryneſs, without any ſenſe of grace, in which ſtate thou art ready to cry out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken me;</hi> and when, in this ſituation, thou ſeeks no ſtrange conſolation, but looks to God alone in humble ſubmiſſion to his will, then the more bitter thy ſufferings are, and thyſelf given up to God; the more thou art conformable and agreeable to him; for this is the laſt trial of God's children.</p>
                  <p>Break off from thoſe deſires which thirſt for any thing elſe but God, and turn them entirely towards him; then, indeed, wilt
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013145_0026_0F8EC350211FA510"/>
thou ſatisfy that longing of thy Saviour, which cauſes him to weep over the ſtubborn and obſtinate. Sigh for the ſalvation of all men, commit thy ſoul into the hands of thy heavenly father, with a mind turned from time to eternity, as tho' each hour was to be thy laſt, and here thou wilt be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formable to thy Saviour, who <hi>thro' much tribulation has entered into the glory of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</hi> This is the path thro' which thou art to follow him, if thou expecteſt to become a partaker of his eternal glory, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 17.</p>

                     <hi>CHAP. VII.</hi> Of the advantage of outward ſuffering.</head>
                  <p>THERE are three ſorts of croſſes which the Almighty diſpenſes to his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren. The firſt is, when a man is converted to God from the courſe of the world, dies to his evil luſts, and forſakes thoſe ſins to which he is inclined. This is hard to the fleſh, for in this caſe that which was before his pleaſure, now becomes his grievous pain. This is one of the heavieſt croſſes he has to bear, <hi>Mat.</hi> v. 29, 30.</p>
                  <p>The other kind of croſs is that which God himſelf diſpenſes, when he ſends to a man many ſorts of inward and outward
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013145_0026_0F8EC350211FA510"/>
tryals and croſſes. If we could receive theſe tryals as proceeding from the depth of God's love, from which they indeed proceed, <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 7, 8. then would we be happy; for God cannot beſtow on thee a more precious gift, than when he brings any kind of ſufferings on thee, this being the only way to cure thy wounds, and heal thee of the plague and leproſy of ſin, <hi>Iſa.</hi> xlv. 7. Whether thou haſt deſerved theſe evils or not? Whether thro' thy own fault or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thy having contributed thereto: Know this, that it is God who ſends them to thee; therefore ſuffer them patiently, and return him thanks for having thus accompliſhed his will in thee.</p>
                  <p>And that we ſhould not be left without a witneſs, of the neceſſity of adverſity, and ſuffering, all the creatures, and the very elements declare the ſame. The wild beaſts, the hail, ſnow, cold, heat, ſtorms, plagues, war, famine and ſickneſs, teſtify to man, that it is thro' many tribulations that he muſt enter the kingdom. Theſe are the lively paints, colours, and drapery where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with God animates and perfects his glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous picture of meekneſs and humility in his beloved creature man. Let all kinds of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions and ſufferings therefore be patiently endured by thee, if thou deſireſt God to perform his good pleaſure in thee.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="unknown:013145_0027_0F8EBA81B05805B8"/>There are people who being convinced of this doctrine, are not ſatisfied with thoſe croſſes which are allotted them, but are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirous to impoſe more upon themſelves; theſe do but torment themſelves without reaping much fruit, as they are building on their own will and fancy, <hi>Mat.</hi> xv. 9. they hinder God's work, and, as it were, oblige him to wait their time. Thus it happens, that when God would work, on ſuch, their nature being depraved, cannot follow God's draught; and when great temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons come, they have no ſtrength to reſiſt. Wherefore it is ſufficient that thou mortify thy evil luſts, and thy corruption without tormenting thyſelf, but rather dwell in the patience, which is moſt agreeable to God. The third kind of croſſes are very bitter, for they conſiſt in hard temptation, in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs and frighful darkneſs, which at times preſs ſo hard on a man, that he chooſes death rather than life. Theſe tryals alter a man's nature more than the hardeſt outward ſuffering; for God ſometimes ſo viſits him with ſtrange inward temptations, darkneſs and dryneſs, that none can apprehend them, but he who paſſes thro' them. Nevertheleſs God knows well to what end he does theſe things. They are certainly the effect of his love; ſo that if we bear them as we ought, they will be of unexpreſſible benefit unto us.
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013145_0027_0F8EBA81B05805B8"/>
For all ſufferings will be productive of good to thee, if thou canſt but ſilently ſubmit to them, and reſign thyſelf up to God; he will cauſe good to ſpring up to thee from theſe very ſufferings; but if thou ſeekeſt for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort any other way; comforts of another kind will alſo ſpring up in thee. Wherefore we ought freely to offer up ourſelves to God, as being willing to ſuffer all thoſe afflictions with which he ſhall pleaſe to viſit us, whether inward or outward, that we may therein be made conformable to Chriſt. For God even alſo ſuffers with him, who wholly reſigns himſelf to the divine will. And when ſufferings thus proceed from God, they are ſweet in the end, and turn to great advantage to us. Wherefore we ought rather to prefer ſcorn before honour, grief rather than joy; for he who is aſſured he ſuffers for God's glory, cannot but feel a lively joy proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from it.</p>
                  <p>All thoſe ſufferings which we ſuffer pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently, and from which we do not, even, deſire to be delivered, but agreeable to God's will, are more agreeable to him, than the beſt of our works, and all burnt offerings, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xv. 22.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo more agreeable to God, and of more advantage to us, in our religious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, to ſuffer with pure reſignation, than to be employed in many good works; for ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013145_0028_0F8EC350DE9D43D8"/>
being more oppoſite to nature, it is thereby more abaſed and the ſpirit the more exalted; for this reaſon that God requires of a ſtrong and vigorous beginner bodily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes, altho' with diſcretion, in ſuch ſort that ſpiritual exerciſe may be thereby help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but from old men already humbled by ſubmiſſion and reſignation, he expects that they ſuffer, in patience and reſignation all that may befall them.</p>
                  <p>To be willing to ſuffer in and according to the will of God is ſo excellent a thing, that our frail nature could not ſupport, in this life, the fruition and reward which God intends to give, in eternity, for the moſt ſlight ſufferings, to which we have been willing to be ſubject, for his ſake. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is ſaid, <hi>That the ſufferings of this time is not to be compared with the glory that ſhall be revealed in us,</hi> Rom. viii. 18. ſo that we cannot ſufficiently return thanks to God for thoſe ſufferings he permits to come upon us. All the ſaints have drank of this cup, and have teſtified that it has not been hurtful but ſalutary to them, <hi>Pſal.</hi> cxix. 67. <hi>James</hi> i. 12. ſo that they have not refuſed to expoſe themſelves thereto, and often even to ſpill their blood for that cauſe. Let us remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that the ſaints were men as well as we, and that we may obtain the ſame help that they were favoured with, <hi>James</hi> v. 17.—
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:013145_0028_0F8EC350DE9D43D8"/>
When in ſeeking for reſt, we turn from God and ſeek comfort in the creatures, we expoſe ourſelves to fall into enormous ſins, in dangerous temptations, and finally into eternal death; wherefore God at ſuch times viſits us with affliction, that our luſts may be ſubdued, and that we may return to him with a ſincere ſenſe and confeſſion of our ſins. Wherefore let us not fear ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, but rather give thanks to God when he ſends them, <hi>Job</hi> v. 17. It is a pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient bearing of ſufferings which ſits us for the poſſeſſion of ſupernatural gifts. Many have fallen by proſperity, but few have been hurt thro' adverſity; the one as it were, undermines the foundations of virtue and goodneſs, but the other lays it ſtedfaſtly ſure in a profound humility, <hi>Iſa.</hi> xxvi. 16.</p>
                  <p>When we receive chaſtiſement; when we are deſpiſed and perſecuted, and bear theſe tryals without complaint; and that ſo far from allowing ourſelves in any thoughts of vengeance, we are not even anxious to vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate ourſelves, leaving the whole to God; we ſhall, thro' divine goodneſs, receive a plentiful reward of peace and comfort; and ſhall experience thoſe earthly chains which bind us to the world to be much looſened; and a deſire will prevail that we may, even, be more abaſed before God and men, <hi>Sam.</hi> vi. 22. To ſuffer patiently thoſe afflictions
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:013145_0029_0F8EC3536A803BD8"/>
which God ſends, is a principal means to obtain his grace, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 12. And let us be particularly careful not to give way to reſentment againſt ſuch perſons as God may make uſe of as a rod, for our amendment. But ſeriouſly conſider in what ſpirit we ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that it be done with patience and reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, then will all things work for our good. It is often our impatience, under ſufferings, which cauſes our greateſt hurt.</p>
                  <p>There are thoſe who faſt, who watch, and aſſiſt the poor, or give themſelves up to other outward exerciſes; but we meet with very few, who can, with patience, ſuffer to be deſpiſed and treated with injuſtice. Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are generally full of hidden pride, holding themſelves in much eſteem; and are deſirous to be thought well of by others. But to what purpoſe is it to appear clean without, and yet to permit anger, revenge, and other impurities to remain in the heart; this is but the whited ſepulchre of a religious Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee. For altho' outward purity is ſo far well, yet it cannot be accounted of any worth, in the ſight of God, whilſt ſin and the love of the creatures defile the inward part; which ought to be God's dwelling place; wherefore firſt ſee that the inſide be cleanſed, and the outſide will ſoon become clean alſo. It's rather a mark of divine diſpleaſure that we ſhould paſs the whole
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:013145_0029_0F8EC3536A803BD8"/>
time of our life in peace and happineſs, without affliction, as the apoſtle witneſſeth, <hi>Heb.</hi> xii. 8. <hi>If you are without chaſtiſement, you are baſtards and not ſons.</hi> Lazarus had his evil things in this life, and the rich man his good things; but obſerve how it fared with each after death. The one is comforted, the other tormented; thus each received the reward meet for him, and ſuch as his humility or pride had ſitted him for; thus every man receiving according to his works. It is almoſt the higheſt degree of the ſpiritual life, to be deſtitute of comfort, either from God or man, and to bear ſuch a ſtate, with patience and ſubmiſſion.</p>
                  <p>We may become martyrs without paſſing thro' the ſword of perſecution from the world, provided we maintain true patience in ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>Let us then ſuffer with joy, ſince none will be crowned <hi>if he has not warred,</hi> 2 Tim. ii. 5. A man may attain to a knowledge of himſelf by ſpiritual exerciſes; but it is thro' ſuffering alone that he manifeſts what his growth in religion is.</p>
                  <p>The Lord our God is with us in our ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, and will deliver us from them in his own time; for he is faithful and will not ſuffer that we ſhould be tempted beyond our ſtrength; but with the temptation will make ſuch way, as that we may be able to

                  <p>IT is neceſſary, as much as poſſible, to keep our minds diſengaged from outward things, looking with ardent deſires towards God, our good and beneficient Lord; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually watching, with prayer, againſt all vain and needleſs thoughts; otherwiſe we ſhall make but little progreſs in virtue. We muſt alſo be careful to avoid all ſloth and idleneſs; for theſe ſoften the heart, and cool charity; but let us endeavour to keep, continually, as in the preſence of God, with deep and ſerious recollection, remembering, that he is near us, always beholding and ready to aſſiſt us with his grace and love. Wherefore let us caſt ourſelves often, as at the feet of his divine majeſty, in deep humi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, begging for the forgiveneſs of our ſins; often meditating on the life and ſufferings of Chriſt, with grateful acknowledgements of his benefits, and ſincere deſires to imitate him.

wonderful works in his creatures; as alſo, on his infinite wiſdom and inexpreſſible love.</p>
                  <p>We ought alſo, with deep reverence, to conſider that God is in himſelf, the ſovereign God, incomprehenſible, unmovable and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite; that he, only, is worthy to be ſought and embraced with an entire and conſtant love: In him ought all the deſires of every heart to be reunited, without meaſure; the more he is known, the more he is loved; and the more we draw near to him, the greater evidence we have of his love. The moſt feeble ray of joy which a chaſte ſoul, who loves God, feels of his divine preſence ſurpaſs all the pleaſures the creatures can produce; they are but bitterneſs compared with divine joy. He who gives up his heart wholly to God, abides in joy, and dies with an aſſurance of its everlaſting continuance. He is already poſſeſſed of heaven and earth, and will enjoy it to all eternity: <hi>For the things which God has prepared for thoſe who love him, are ſuch as never entered into the heart of man to conceive,</hi> 1 Cor. ii. 9. There is no compariſon to be made between the love of God and the love of the creatures; all that appears amiable in the world will be ſeen to be mere illuſion, when the inward eye is opened in us.

praiſe, to renounce thyſelf, to do good to all men, even as thou would'ſt have them to do to thee; in fine, to live as holy as it is poſſible; if this is indeed thy caſe ſo that nothing is wanting, but ſtrength to fulfil theſe good deſires, God will take pleaſure in thee, and with them will alſo give ability to fulfil his will agreeable to his good pleaſure, for he is faithful, <hi>Phil.</hi> ii. 13. 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> v. 24.</p>
                  <p>The foundation of our love to God, lies in the ſincerity of our will, and is perfected by good works, which if they are ſincere, will be conſtantly maintained, to the utmoſt of our power, even in the midſt of ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. Love is as it were, imprinted in our nature, and when this love is under proper government; man loves God more than all the creatures, and even more than himſelf. It is a deplorable caſe, that we ſhould have ſo perverted the excellent order of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, as not to direct this moſt precious trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of love towards the ſovereign good, but fix it on ourſelves and on the poor fleeting creatures of this world. This ſo much afflicts thoſe who are indeed the friends of God, that they could, as it were, pour down floods of tears, under a ſenſe, that our bleſſed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer is thus drove away, with ſo much indignity, from thoſe hearts, for whom he laid down his life, and on whoſe behalf he is ſtill pouring forth his prayers to his Father.</p>

                     <hi>Where thy treaſure is, there will thy heart be alſo,</hi> Mat. vi. 21. Inquire carefully where that treaſure which thou loveſt the moſt is, if in God or the creatures. If thou loveſt God with uprightneſs, thou wilt continually ſigh after him, as one oppreſſed with a burning thirſt. <hi>As the hunted hart panteth after the water-brooks, ſo doth my ſoul after thee O God,</hi> is the language of all truly longing hearts. We cannot more acceptably ſerve God, than in thus deſiring to keep near him, always keeping watch over our hearts, <hi>Prov.</hi> iv. 23. God loves the heart; he looks not at what is outward; he looks not as man looks, who ſees that only which the natural eye perceives; but he looks even into the bottom of the heart, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xvi. 16. He regards only a lively inclination for divine and virtuous things. Thoſe works done by men with eſteem and complaiſancy of themſelves, are diſagreeable to God. Wherefore all thy works ſhould proceed from an heart ſincerely given up to God; having the good pleaſure of him, to whom all things belong, ſolely in view. Wherefore in the uſe of thoſe gifts and comforts which he affords us, we ought to ſeek nothing but his glory and moſt holy will, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 31. It is ſcarce to be expreſſed, how much God loves a man ſo diſpoſed, and how abundant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly he opens to him his hidden treaſures. God
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:013145_0033_0F8EC357CC46A3A0"/>
is always inclined and ready to receive every one who in ſincerity of heart, is willing to be converted to him, who empties and frees himſelf from the creatures; he, as it were, runs to meet ſuch a man, and embraces him, with ſweetneſs and love, <hi>Luke</hi> xv. 20.</p>
                  <p>We can wiſh for nothing, but what is to be found in God. Doſt thou wiſh for love, for fidelity, for truth, for comfort, all theſe are found without meaſure, and in the moſt perfect manner in him? Doſt thou deſire beauty; he is beauty itſelf? Doſt thou deſire almightineſs; he is the Almighty? Doſt thou wiſh for riches; he is the maſter of all things? Thus thou wilt find in the only ſovereign good, which is God, all thy heart can deſire in the moſt accompliſhed manner. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore drive far from thee all the creatures, in order that thou mayeſt, without ceaſing, raiſe up thy ſpirit to the Creator, and thus abide in his preſence. For whilſt the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſtill remain, with affection, imprinted in thy mind; whilſt thou yet eſteemeſt theſe uncertain things, as matters of weight, thou haſt but very little love for God, and art ſtill much a ſtranger to that which is heavenly, 1 <hi>John</hi> ii, 15.</p>
                  <p>Turn thyſelf each moment towards God, for he is ſo good, that all thoſe who ſeek him with ſincerity, will obtain all things from him, <hi>Pſalm</hi> clxv. 19. He not only clears them

                  <p>IF thou deſires to attain to that purity and perfection which the goſpel propoſes, thou muſt keep in ſilence and retirement as much as thy ſeveral duties will permit, avoiding the converſation of men; always ſeeking for time and opportunity to medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate on God and heaven. Keep the door of thy ſenſes ſhut to all vanity; and the door of thy heart and reaſon cloſed to all images, and impreſſions from paſſing objects. Thou oughteſt alſo to hold the power of thy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires at liberty from all that can bind thy freedom, and engage thy will in affectionate ſolicitude oranxious care for the things of this

life; and having thus gathered together thy deſires and thy reaſon, turn them towards the ſovereign and only good, and reſt quiet there; thus thy mind will be raiſed above temporal things, and ſet upon God, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual contemplation of him, <hi>Pſalm</hi> cxxi. We muſt, as it were, bind ourſelves to God, in an entire reſignation to his holy will, keeping our eyes upon him, and receiving every thing as coming from his immediate hand. But as we cannot always dwell in a ſteady contemplation of God, we ought, as much as is in our power, to perſevere in ſuch a ſtate. And when we find ourſelves de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the ſight of God, don't let us reſt ſatisfied under this deprivation, but turn into ourſelves, gather all our inward ſtrength in order to ſeek after God; even tho' it ſhould be an hundred times in a day, and we ſhall find daily more eaſe and ſatisfaction in this labour; ſo that it will be eaſier for us to think on God in retirement, than it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to be ſcattered in the multitude of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.</p>
                  <p>If thou deſires to make any progreſs in this way, remember that God is every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſaying unto thee, <hi>My child enter into thyſelf, watch thy heart, that it may be kept pure from every vice, and thy deſires free from all ſolicitude and love of earthly things.</hi> Hold the ſtrength of thy imagination directed towards

God, and attach thyſelf to him, as to the ſovereign good, with fervent love; that ſo thy whole ſoul, with all its faculties, may be gathered in God, and become one ſpirit with him. This is in ſhort, an abſtract of the foundation of all happineſs. It is by this means thou ſhalt receive all that is moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lime and perfect, to which very few attain, becauſe moſt people are ſo much taken up with ſolicitude and love of earthly comforts.</p>
                  <p>But ſeek thou the hidden wiſdom, which the heavenly doctor himſelf has inſcribed, thro' his divine inſpiration, in the hearts of thoſe who ſeek him, with an humble confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and ſerious deſires, in a quiet ſilence, and renouncing all fleſhly freedoms, to the utmoſt of their power. God often manifeſts more of himſelf to a ſimple country man, or to a weak woman who are in this frame of mind, than to thoſe wiſe ones of the world, whoſe knowledge is not founded on a true humility of heart, <hi>Mat.</hi> xi. 25. It is a moſt deplorable caſe, that we who were created for to be partakers of this ſublime grace; who are called to it, who may receive it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually, from God, ſhould neglect it in this life, to ſuch a degree as may occaſion our being eternally deprived of it.</p>

In this world the body is, as it were, in its own country, ſurrounded with natural conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, which are as its friends, by whom it is continually ſerved, as meat, drink, and all terreſtrial things! But the ſpirit is here be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low in miſery, its friends having their reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in heaven, <hi>Phil.</hi> iii. 20.

                  <p>It is better, for thee, that God ſhould be thy friend and thy protector againſt all men, who may be againſt thee, than if all the creatures were on thy ſide, and God ſhould on that account be againſt thee.</p>
                  <p>Keep thy outward man in tranquillity, and thy ſoul in purity; for purity and innocen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy afford more knowledge and wiſdom than great ſtudy. <hi>Pſalm</hi> cxi. 10. <hi>Wiſ.</hi> 1.4. Turn

                  <p>If thou deſireſt to be united to God, thou muſt reſign thy own will, thy carnal cares and delights, in order to obtain this ſovereign good: If thou expecteſt that God will take his reſidence in thy heart, it muſt be empty and naked, and thou muſt be poor in ſpirit and preſerved free from ſolidtude, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> ii. 4, 5. then will the ſun of righteouſneſs mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velouſly operate therein. Keep out of thy mind all thoſe images and figures which will be preſenting themſelves to take poſſeſſion of thy mind and heart, retain them not with thee, and they will ſoon vaniſh away; for all images of the creatures muſt be eraſed out of thy mind, that the mind of Chriſt may be imprinted therein: Neither ſuffer thy will to be fixed in any thing, but let it reſt upon God alone, <hi>Pſalm</hi> lxxiii. 25.

And if thou ſhould apprehend thou haſt loſt this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, bend all thy ſtrength to remove all ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacles, in order to its return to thee. Thoſe who are eſpouſed to God, ought rather to ſuffer death than voluntarily to do any thing which may diſpleaſe God: Nothing ought to give joy to ſuch an one, but God alone, and that which pleaſes him: For to his pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating eyes all things are preſent. As often as a man turns his heart towards God in true confidence, ſo often, tho' ſometimes inſenſibly, does he receive of the holy ſpirit, a freſh ſupply of grace. When a man, in deep humility, ſincerely labours to draw near to God, this real and ſincere return to God, will infallibly be rewarded: Whilſt for all other works, where the honour of God is not the principle end, we muſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect but a ſlight recompence.

Some undertake mighty things, ſo that it appears as tho' they were like to become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary people; yet many of theſe are apt to return to their old courſe of life, to join with nature and to ſeek comfort in the creatures. Others come on with courage and paſs, as it were, thro' fire and water, but not having paſſed thro' death, tho' they endeavour to gather inward, cannot come to any ſettlement, but meet with much an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh and pain; the ſooner theſe people die to themſelves, the ſooner they attain to peace.</p>
                  <p>As many diverſities of diſpoſitions as there are amongſt men, ſo many different means doth God uſe to lead us to peace.

Nevertheleſs attend to thy reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious call, and inquire what God requires of thee.

<pb n="63" facs="unknown:013145_0039_0F8EBA81493A0B98"/>
receives all which happens to him, whether inward or outward, as coming from the hand of God. He ſubmits to God's hidden judgment, having the will of God and not himſelf ſincerely in view. He will not be in doubt what he ought to do, and will ſoon overcome all obſtacles, however ſtrange and difficult they may be; ſuch a ſtate is of more worth than the moſt ſublime exerciſes. God will not permit ſuch a man to go aſtray, however dangerous his way may be.</p>
                  <p>A continual attention to one's ſelf is dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult in the beginning, but it becomes eaſy. When a man truly proves his whole life, his ways, his words and habits, in order to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover if they are agreeable to the will of God, he will learn to know himſelf and will diſcover his ſins and be painfully deſirous to be delivered from them.</p>
                  <p>A man of God ſhould accuſtom himſelf to have God, as much as poſſible, preſent in his mind. Keep thy ſpirit in the ſame diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, both in the time and out of the time of prayer.

Thou muſt not be ſatisfied with having thought upon God, as a paſſing object, for ſuch thoughts ſoon vaniſh, and where there is one thought of God, there will be ten others relating to temporal things, which drive away the firſt. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it is neceſſary that we labour vigorouſly to turn our minds entirely towards God, to preſerve a ſenſe of God's preſence within, with a ſimple and ſweet inclination towards him; ſo that whatever happens to us, we may always maintain an equality of ſoul, a fidelity and conſtant ſincerity to God, that he in all things may be the principle object of all our actions. Thus none will be able to turn, or ſeparate us from God. And he who remains thus united to him, will not eaſily be drawn into ſin.

                  <p>Wherefore it is not neceſſary to be very ſolicitous for the enjoyment of inward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation, it is ſufficient that thou remain united to God, from a ſincere deſire of pleaſing him; for a ſincere will of pleaſing God exceeds all gifts and endowments.

                  <p>THE ſtrong will of man acting in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the divine will, is a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal obſtruction to our progreſs towards the land of reſt, in proportion as a man is more or leſs given up to do and ſuffer the will of God, ſo is he the more or leſs ſenſibly touched with things that happen to him.</p>
                  <p>He that is truly given up receives all things as coming from the hand of God, eſteeming the creatures only as God's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments. Hence his labour is, that neither

To ſuch a man nothing is an evil, all is equal. He is not caſt down by diſgrace nor exalted in proſperity. He is able to bear pleaſure and grief, ſweet and bitter, honour and ſhame, health and ſickneſs, elevation and abaſement with an equality of mind, <hi>Phil.</hi> iv. 11, 13. He is always giving thanks to God, and his eye is ever upon him from a ſenſe of his goodneſs, and an aſſurance that all the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are under his direction. The heavens and the earth are as his book in which he reads and meditates on the mighty wonders of God; ſuch a man being delivered from his own will, reſts in God, in an inward peace of mind, for in that degree that we dwelt truly in God, in that degree we find ourſelves in peace; and in that degree we are out of him, in that degree we are in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude, <hi>John</hi> xvi. 33. It is in this peace of the ſoul that God dwells, and it is in him who is, indeed, poſſeſſed of this peace that God works, and makes uſe of as his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrument; Oh! how happy is ſuch a man, thus truly given up to God, his heart is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved from ſin, and he enjoys much divine comfort.

is abſolutely neceſſary to watch continually over the roots of ſin, in the heart, of which great numbers often remain, tending to diſorderly paſſions, even in thoſe who have been long exerciſed in the practice of piety; ſuch as anger, hatred, luxury and other vices, which have often drawn away and ſunk into perdition, even perſons who had made great progreſs in piety and had been much favoured by God, for want of having carefully watched over theſe dangerous roots. Evil thoughts and looſe imaginations alſo greatly hinder the divine operation, trouble the heart and drive from it the holy ſpirit, which cannot dwell with impure or vain thoughts; theſe the more they are given way to, the deeper roots they take in the heart.</p>
                  <p>The devil is always about us and mixes with that to which he knows our nature is moſt inclined, in order to ſtrengthen ſin in us. <hi>He walketh about as a roaring lion ſeeking whom he may devour,</hi> 1 Pet. v. 8.

                  <p>A SERVANT of Chriſt has ſaid, <hi>If thou wilt gather thyſelf into God, thou muſt be divorced from thy ſenſes, for God is a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit,</hi> John iv. 24. Obſerve if thou haſt not ſuffered ſomething to come betwixt thee and God, by giving way to a ſelf-ſeeking diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Be careful to obſerve by his light and grace, the preſence of the divine eſſence in thee, how God reveals himſelf to thee in himſelf, and in all creatures. <hi>Go continually forth from thy ſelfiſhneſs and activity;</hi> (much is contained in theſe expreſſions) and in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der more diſtinctly to underſtand them, thou muſt obſerve that the more thy ſoul is pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, thro' the force of reaſon and the ſenſes, the more it is filled with imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. The more it labours for that which is outward, the more it is weakened and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes inwardly ſick as to God. For when the inferior faculties attend on their own operations, the ſoul is obliged to co-operate with them. Here the creatures darken the
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:013145_0045_0F8EC271A97290B0"/>
ſpirit, and ſo fill it with other objects, that the ſoul cannot ſee God, nor give itſelf up entirely to him.</p>
                  <p>We muſt ſeek God in ourſelves, by the ſtrength of a chaſte love, which gathers up all the powers of the ſoul, and draws them from all outward diſſipations and operations; that we may re-enter the inward reſt, and the door may be ſhut to every figure and image which may diſturb the mind.— Wherefore let us turn our ſenſes, our reaſon and our memory with love towards God, in the center of the ſoul, and there cleave to him, in humble ſilent adoration, where all thoughts and imaginations are brought down and ſilenced; it is in this interior recollecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that grace begins its operation and from whence this pure ſpirit flows into the facul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>Turn thyſelf in this manner towards God, amend thy evil practices, abſtract thy ſenſes, as much as poſſible from exterior objects. It is by ſubmiſſion of the will, by draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off from the creatures and a proper ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of God's gifts, that thou wilt be clothed with true humility, and receive the ſpirit. For in order to do God's work, he requires a ſoul empty and freed from care; depending on him alone: God has no want of any thing elſe to do his work in us, but
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:013145_0046_0F8EC272A9D3C768"/>
that we be truely emptied and ſtand in pure nothingneſs before him.</p>
                  <p>Dwell under a ſenſe of thy proper no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingneſs, thy natural nothingneſs, thy ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful nothingneſs, and there remain firm.— And if, at any time, thou feeleſt thy heart raiſed in love and gratitude towards God, and finds a diſpoſition to celebrate his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty and goodneſs towards thee, do it with humility and return immediately into thy nothingneſs, there to meditate on this won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful bounty as well to mankind in general, as to thee in particular; alſo, to contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plate with awe on his humanity and his ſufferings. Return him hearty thanks for all theſe benefits.—Aſk of him all thoſe virtues which thou ſtandeſt in need of; ſubmit thyſelf, with all thy heart to his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret will, in an entire ſubmiſſion of thyſelf; thus flow, as it were, entirely into God.— Embrace him, in a full confidence; repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to thyſelf, at all times, thy bloody ſpouſe, and thus paſs from the wounds of his humanity into the light of his divinity; in this exerciſe adhere ſtrongly to the adviſe given in ſcripture, <hi>Pſalm</hi> xxxvii, 5, 7. <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit thy way unto the Lord; truſt alſo in him; and he ſhall bring it to paſs. And he ſhall bring forth thy righteouſneſs as the lights and thy judgment as the noon-day. Reſt in the Lord and wait patiently for him.</hi>

                     <pb n="77" facs="unknown:013145_0046_0F8EC272A9D3C768"/>The creatures as they come out of the hand of God are good and amiable, but they are not the goodneſs itſelf; nor are they that on which we ought to fix our love.—God is alone the eſſence of goodneſs and of love. Conſider that he, tho' ſo great and good is always with thee; that he looks upon thee in his inexpreſſible love, that he ſees thee, in all thy actions, thy words and thy thoughts; even a thouſand times better than thou ſeeſt thyſelf, and withal is always, thro' his benignity, waiting upon thee and willing to receive thee. Wherefore labour with all thy ſtrength and deſire to be united to him, in a perfect and efficacious love; that thy nothingneſs and weakneſs may be quite ſwallowed up and reformed, ſo may thou become ſomething in him, who is the only true and truly exiſting being.</p>

                  <p>And yet he is nearer to all things than they are to themſelves, who altho' he dwells in the center of the ſoul, nevertheleſs is hid

to all the ſenſes and unknown to all outward things, yet there is nothing ſo eaſy to be obtained as God, where a good will and ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere deſire prevails, we may reach his im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſity with a poor and broken ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Thou oughteſt to enter upon the work of thy ſalvation, with a reſolute and unſhaken mind, which in a lively and chaſte love of God, as it were, hates itſelf and dying to all creatures, renounces earthly loves, that it may eternally poſſeſs God, in a pure and faithful love. And when thy merciful Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther perceives thy heart thus purified and tending towards him, he will pour himſelf into thy ſoul, as the ſun pours out its rays into the open air.</p>
                  <p>When the ſpirit is ſenſible of the preſence of God, it goes, as it were, out of itſelf, all that it has leaves it, and it plunges itſelf into its own nothingneſs, even ſometimes ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gining that its intelligence is more ſtupid than that of the brute creation. But then the King upholds it by his divine virtue, for the more we are abaſed, the more we are exalted, and we do not properly ſee the height of God but in the valley of humility.</p>
                  <p>Here a man receives ſo great light, and ſo much knowledge of the truth, that all that is not God is irkſome to him, <hi>Pſalm</hi> lxxiii. 15. The more humility he maintains in his heart, the more light he receives. Hence
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:013145_0047_0F8EC27306CDAF18"/>
proceeds great joy in ſpirit. The whole world cannot hurt him that is fixed in this ſtate; neither can he ever fall from it, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept he ſhould take a delight in himſelf, or ſhould attribute to himſelf thoſe graces he has received, as tho' he was the author of them.</p>

                  <p>WHEN a man finds himſelf deeply exerciſed and nature is quite poor, he is, as it were, ſurpriſed and would have ſomething to himſelf; he would willingly look into and underſtand the work of God; but be careful of ſuch an an inquiry, elſe the Lord may leave thee in this time of need.— Before nature becomes wholly mortified many ſorrowful things come to paſs, for ſhe is ſo corrupted ſince the fall of our firſt fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and has ſo vehement an inclination to ſatisfy herſelf, that ſhe would willingly have always before her ſome object, wherein to delight herſelf, either in words or actions amongſt men or in ſolitude; and when over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come on one ſide, ſhe raiſes on the other, always ſeeking to ſatisfy ſelf, even in the

gifts of God; ſo that ſhe prefers herſelf to God in appropriating all things to herſelf, by which ſhe deprives God of his praiſes and glory, and imperceptibly hinders his gifts and graces from operating in the ſoul.</p>
                  <p>This immoderate love of one's ſelf reigns at this time in a deplorable manner in all ſtates, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> iii. 2. Nevertheleſs it muſt periſh and be entirely extinguiſhed. We muſt die to ourſelves and be entirely ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of our own will, of a vain complacency in ſurveying our own attainments, with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, as well as of all other ſins, if we are ſincerely willing to be united to God; but this will not come to paſs without ſuſtaining ſeveral grievous combats, by many victories obtained, and by renewedly making a ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of our ſelfiſhneſs. This is not the work of a day, it will require much pains and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour before the mind can be drawn away from temporal things; and our own wills ſo reduced as to ſubmit to God's will as well in proſperity as in adverſity.—Contrary things cannot ſubſiſt together. If we will have fire the wood muſt be conſumed. The ſeed muſt die before we can reap fruit: If thou deſires that God may always operate in thee, thou muſt remain in a paſſive ſtate, and keep thy faculties from their own ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, in a full and entire renunciation of ſelf from a ſenſe of thy inability and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thingneſs.
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:013145_0048_0F8EC273A646EB70"/>
The deeper this nothingneſs is, the more real is the divine operation; <hi>for our own righteouſneſs is as filthy rags,</hi> Iſa. lxiv. 6. When God ſpeaks, all the faculties of thy ſoul muſt keep ſilence and muſt ceaſe from action. This death and deſtruction of ſelf is ſo heavy to him that bears it and his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſo preſſed thereby, that he knows not what to do; this pain proceeds from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willingneſs in the creature to die, neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs we muſt neceſſarily paſs thro' it by vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the death of Chriſt. The more there is of ſin and ſelfiſhneſs in our natural ſtate, the more ſenſible is the pain. Our ſalvation is ſooner perfected in ſuffering and in ceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of action, than in activity. In this ſtate we meet with many hinderances, for nature is active and would willingly co-operate and have ſome object wherewith to eaſe her pain, as pious readings, religious converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the like; but in this ſtate it is better to deny ourſelves of ſuch comforts, if able to ſupport without it. For the new ſpiritual birth will not attain its perfection, if not preceeded by deadly anguiſh; and every thing that alleviates theſe ſufferings, will prevent that birth which would have been attained thro' a conſtant perſervance therein.</p>
                  <p>Our dear Saviour conducts thoſe of his friends whom he would bring into the

greateſt perfection, by a path ſo ſtrait and deſert that they are often fearful what will become of them. He proves them for their greater advantage, as he did that good man Job. Sometimes he withholds, from them all ſenſe of his grace, of his union and of his love, leaving them thus ſtripped and barren; as tho' he had never known nor loved them. This was the ſtate of deſertion wherein our dear Saviour was in, when upon the croſs he cried out, <hi>My God, my God, why haſt thou forſaken me,</hi> Mat. xxvi. 39. From whence we learn, that in whatever ſtate we be, either of joy or grief, we ought to remain quiet, and to labour, truly, to give ourſelves up, even tho' all ſenſe of grace ſhould be taken from us: Our virtues moſtly proceed from our afflictions as patience proceeds from perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution; humility from diſgrace; and ſo of all the reſt.</p>
                  <p>Sometimes God permits his friends to be expoſed to many ſorts of temptations, as pride, luxury, helliſh envy and other ſins which they thought they had already over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come.—They are ſometimes expoſed to checks of conſcience, to doubts, incredulity, blaſphemy and hatred of God and to other like terrible aſſaults, which it ſeems impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to ſupport. Theſe temptations are at times ſo preſſing that they ſeem to <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> find ourſelves.—This pain be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes the harder when the faculties of the ſoul moſt ſtrongly reſiſts ſin; eſpecially in fleſhly liberties, for he who is preſſed down with ſorrow, willingly ſeeks for comfort from nature; except when forbidden by the ſpirit. But whatever may be thy trials, whether light or hard, bear them with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, don't endeavour to withdraw from under them; but remain in quiet, don't turn away from the preſence of God, however diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing may be the thoughts which trouble thee; let them return as they come, don't notice them. For tho' all the devils in hell and the whole world ſhould pour into thy ſoul and body, all their malice and all their impurities, if thou art truly ſincere before God, and thy reſolution be to die rather than voluntarily to commit any one ſin, they will purify thee in the virtue of Chriſt, and will prepare thee for the moſt excellent gifts! If thou couldſt only remain in humility and be truly given up, thy heavenly Father would not fail to deliver thee in a ſuitable time and ſend thee comfort, from himſelf, in a manner which would infinitely exceed all thy afflictions. All accidents, whatever they be, will prepare thee for God, if thou
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:013145_0050_0F8EC2753825FA48"/>
wilt only note and make proper uſe of them in ſilence and patience.</p>
                  <p>It is thus God often tries his children, and they alſo meet with tryals from thoſe with whom they live, by hard words and violent reproaches, condemning their ways and actions, as mere folly and dangerous hereſy and error, that thereby, they may be truly humbled, as well in their own ſpirits, as in the eyes of the world. For they muſt be faſtened to the croſs with Chriſt, naked and deſtitute of all ſupport, and freed from every thing they were naturally attached to; ſo that their own will may be truly brought under ſubjection. Wherefore ſuffer with patience; forſake thyſelf, be circumſpect and keep ſilence, ſaying in thyſelf, <hi>Lord thou knoweſt I ſeek thee alone,</hi> then God will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat for thee. Be thou ſilent. Ah! if thou kneweſt the inexpreſſible good which reſults from this ſtate and how great is the love of God to thee, even in the pains he brings thee under, and with how much eaſe theſe tryals drive away the evil ſpirit, thou wouldſt run to meet the croſs and wouldſt look upon that day as loſt, wherein thou ſhouldſt have no occaſion of ſuffering.</p>
                  <p>He who can ſuffer in patience, with an humble truſt, under the ſecret judgments of God, as long as it pleaſeth him, is ſure
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:013145_0050_0F8EC2753825FA48"/>
of his protection, God draws him to himſelf and fills him with his love.</p>
                  <p>Turn thyſelf towards God, with all thy ſtrength, verify in acts what thou haſt now read; retire into the inward center of thy heart, it is there that truth reſides; it will not be thro' a multitude of words that thou wilt attain it, but rather in keeping ſilent, in ſuffering and remaining quiet, in deny<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thyſelf, and confiding in God. Ever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member, what thou art, where thou art, from whence thou ſprung, and where thou wouldſt go. Take alſo care what thou doſt, why thou doſt it, and perſevere conſtantly in virtue and truth until death.</p>

                  <p>OUR ſpiritual progreſs is much hinder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thro' giving way to ſelf-love of any kind, as alſo to an unwarrantable affection for any creature whatever. Every love that takes poſſeſſion of the heart of man, and which kindles in him the deſire of ſeeing, hearing, or poſſeſſing any thing, that does
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:013145_0051_0F8EC2790EA085A8"/>
not tend to the glory of God, is a diſorderly love of the creatures; ſuch as is the love and deſire after earthly things; money, wealth, houſes, clothes, books, furniture and ſuch things which we may poſſeſs, or make uſe of, for neceſſity, or for ſuperfluity; and which we often ſeek after thro' fleſhly liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; ſetting our affections thereon, in ſuch ſort, that we bear with impatience to have them taken from us. Such perſons, as theſe, are eſteemed to have a propriety in thoſe things, as they hold them without regard, whether their poſſeſſing of them is, or is not agreeable to the will of God; this ſituation is by ſome ſpiritual writers called PROPRI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ETY the will of the creature not being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the divine will, which requires of thoſe who are truly poor in ſpirit, that their deſires be ſo diſengaged from what they poſſeſs, as <hi>that they poſſeſs them, as tho' they poſſeſſed them not,</hi> 1 Cor. vii. 29, 31. being ready, freely to give up and forſake all, when God requires it; ſo that if theſe things are taken from them, by God's permiſſion, their underſtanding and will ſhould conſent thereto, without murmur.</p>
                  <p>Another hinderance ariſes from the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of riches and honour; from ſenſuality and immoderate indulgence, in eating, drinking, &amp;c. giving way to vain, needleſs and uncharitable words and actions; alſo in
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:013145_0051_0F8EC2790EA085A8"/>
vain curioſity and other diſſipations and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſions of our ſenſes. It is by means of theſe things, that we loſe a taſte to ſpiritual ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes; for a ſenſual man has no reliſh for thoſe things which belong to the ſpirit: Here the inferior powers debaſe the ſpirit, and turn it away from the ſovereign good, cauſing it to take its reſt in things that are ſenſible and vile. Truth allows us all that is neceſſary, provided we do not deſire to ſatisfy our fleſhly appetites; for the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the ſpiritual life is a death to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural ſenſes; and requires that we turn away from all the creatures in whom we uſed to confide; in order that we may attach our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to that which is eternal and divine.</p>
                  <p>A further hinderance in our ſpiritual pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs lies in <hi>the good opinion we have of our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and our hidden pride,</hi> this often ariſes from the eſteem we have of our good works, and other religious exerciſes; as alſo from the ſweetneſs and inward joy we are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſenſible of. Here the very progreſs ſuch make in virtue is itſelf a cauſe of ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling to them; this falſe eſteem of their vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues becomes their chief hinderance, as it proceeds from an heart unmortified, impure and proud; ſuch perſons poſſeſs all they have in propriety. They depend more on their own works than on the freedom of the children of God, purchaſed by the precious
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:013145_0052_0F8EC27922AF3A08"/>
ſufferings of Chriſt, in which alone, they ought to ſeek for peace and reſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> iii. 24, 25. Hence they fall into pride; ſeek a vain reputation; look upon themſelves as of conſequence and are too ready to judge other people with ſourneſs and paſſion.— There is nothing ſo hurtful in a ſpiritual life as pride and ſelf-love; this caſts many into perdition who had made a good begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and been once divinely favoured.</p>
                  <p>There alſo ariſes a great obſtruction to an eſtabliſhment in religion from a deſire which prevails in ſome to be eſteemed and favoured by men, <hi>James</hi> iv. 4. Many, from a deſire of theſe things, do that which they ought not to do, and omit to do what they ought, in order to gain favour, or avoid being ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the jeſt, the ſcorn and hatred of men; theſe forget the apoſtolick advice, <hi>Gal.</hi> i. 10. <hi>Do I ſeek to pleaſe men? for if I yet pleaſed men, I ſhould not be the ſervant of Chriſt.</hi> Such if they do not humble themſelves and amend, will ſuffer an irreparable damage.</p>
                  <p>An inordinate care for and deſire of earthly things, is alſo often a conſiderable hinderance; the apoſtle tells the believers, <hi>That he that goeth to war does not entangle himſelf in the affairs of this life,</hi> Tim. ii. 2, 4. Nevertheleſs moſt are ſolicitous, and even torment themſelves to attain to many things they do not really ſtand in need of: In theſe the inclination is
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:013145_0052_0F8EC27922AF3A08"/>
ſo much on outward things, and the deſire of the ſoul ſo filled therewith, that it is pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for them, to think of, and confide in God as they ought to do. We are indeed, exhorted in ſcripture to labour and be care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for that which is neceſſary, nevertheleſs leſt the heart ſhould be carried away with ſuch cares, diſtruſt and ſolicitude is wholly forbidden to the diſciples and believers in Chriſt, <hi>Mat.</hi> vi. 25, 28. Theſe things obſcure our faith in, and dependance on God; leſſen our charity to our neighbour, and expoſe us to many temptations and ſnares of the devil, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> vi. 9.—We muſt alſo be very careful to preſerve our hearts from bad or vain thoughts, and even from ſuch thoughts, which tho' not evil in themſelves, yet are not of uſe. Indulgences of this kind ſhew the heart to be relaxed and vain; and to have but little love to God. Thoſe bad thoughts and ſuggeſtions proceed from the enemy and altho' we may not wholly give ourſelves up to them, yet where they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulged, they are a great hinderance to true piety and tend to drive away the holy ſpirit. They manifeſtly ſhew that there is a want of mortification, and that a ſufficient watch is not kept. If a ſufficient degree of zeal prevailed we could not thus abuſe our time; but theſe thoughts would, thro' divine help, be drove away and the heart continually
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:013145_0053_0F8EC279EFCB3EA8"/>
recur to the contemplation of Chriſt, and meditation of his ſufferings.</p>
                  <p>Theſe hinderances and many more, which might be mentioned, muſt ſooner or later be mortified, and entirely ſtripped off, thro' the divine power, <hi>Eph.</hi> iv. 12. The reaſon that they ſtill live in us, is becauſe we do not cloſely enough obſerve and watch over the inward ſtate of our hearts. The foundation of the heavenly life lies in retirement, ſilence, tranquillity and a continual attention to the voice of God ſpeaking inwardly to our hearts.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who voluntarily indulge themſelves in theſe evil diſpoſitions, either in whole, or in part, will ſtill remain alive, unto ſin, nor will they be delivered, notwithſtanding their confeſſion of them, <hi>Prov.</hi> xxviii. 13. Even the good works of ſuch people are defiled with ſin; they can make no progreſs in the ſpiritual life: For the vices to which they are ſtill attached, are like ſo many thick veils, black and hard, which cover the eyes of the ſoul, ſo that they know not themſelves; for the light of grace cannot enlighten them, becauſe this covering of their inward eyes and ears hinders them, ſo from ſeeing and hearing that they will excuſe and even vindicate their practice, which occaſions their ſtill remaining under captivity to ſin. The tye by which they are united to the light is ſo ſmall, that they eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fall into great ſins, and there is ſcarce one amongſt an hundred of ſuch perſons, but are
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:013145_0053_0F8EC279EFCB3EA8"/>
carried away by death, before they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared. If we could but ſenſibly feel the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable ſtate of ſuch ſouls, who after they have been in a good degree enlightened, give way to ſuch evil indulgences, we ſhould very much dread the dangerous conſequences of voluntarily giving way to commit even one ſin. On the other hand, how happy is that ſoul who dies to itſelf; how pure, how chaſte and free from ſin and of all inordinate deſire; how quiet and free from pain and fear; united to God in ſpirit here and eternally hereafter.</p>
                  <p>The ſum of what has been ſaid, is contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in two expreſſions, that is in <hi>ſelf-love</hi> and in <hi>the love of God.</hi> Self-love ſeeks its own advantage. The love of God ſeeks his will and glory, and the advantage of others. So much love as a man has to God ſo much does he deſpiſe himſelf, and ſo much does he renounce his own will, thro' the power of God. Self-love can go ſo far as to cauſe us to deſpiſe God; and the love of God can ſo encreaſe, that we come ſo to hate ourſelves, and our own will, that in all things we wholly renounce ourſelves for the love of God:—Hence it clearly appears that <hi>ſelf-love</hi> and the <hi>love of the creatures</hi> and of <hi>ſin,</hi> is the ſpring which defileth the heart, and caſts it into trouble and diſorder. God give us grace, with entire ſincerity, to enter into this labour, and to love him, in time, and dwell with him in an happy eternity.</p>

we are, we have a being, we are ſomething.</p>
                  <p>Why, what are we? Saith the other.</p>
                  <p>Why, brother drop! Doſt thou not know? We, even we, as ſmall and contemptible as we are, in ourſelves, yet we are members of the ſea: Poor drops though we be, yet let us not be diſcouraged: We, even we, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the vaſt ocean.</p>
                  <p>How? Saith the other, we belong to the ſea, to the ocean: How can that be? We have heard of the mighty greatneſs of the ocean.—We have heard that the ſea is great and wide wherein are things creeping innumerable.—That they who go down in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the ſea, in ſhips they ſee the wonders of Lord in the deep.—In the ſea alſo we hear, there be theſe mighty rocks, whoſe founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are unmoveable.

                  <p>No, 'tis true, ſaith the other; for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent we are not of the ocean, becauſe we are not yet joined to the ocean: And except we periſh, and be diſſolved, as it were, to nothing; we are nothing, but if the ſun draws us up, ſcatters us and diſſolves us to nothing; ſo that we are not ſeen to be ſo much as drops, then are we like to be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing; for then we ſhall return into the

What are we? ſays the one: We are nothing ſays the other; we are but a ſhadow, a dream, a bubble; not ſo much as the drop of a bucket, or as the duſt of the balance, we are but as the morning dew before the ſun, and as ſtubble before the ſire, and as ſmoke before the wind, ready to be conſumed, ſcattered and diſſolved to nothing.</p>
                     <p>Oh! ſays the other: Though in ourſelves we are but ſhadows, bubbles and poor drops, and as thou ſayeſt, we are no more than a drop, a bubble, ſoon up and ſoon down: We have no power in ourſelves, yet we are, we have a being. Nay, we are more than thou
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:013145_0055_0F8EC27A7197BD60"/>
canſt imagine.—Why brother, what are we? Why? I'll tell thee what we are: We are members of the very body of Jeſus Chriſt, we are (as I may ſay) fleſh of his fleſh, and bone of his bone; and we ſhall be made one ſpirit with him, and therefore be contented: Though we in ourſelves are poor and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temptible, and apart from him nothing, yea worſe than nothing: Yet by the grace of God we are, what we are: We (in ourſelves) cannot ſay, I am, or I live: We cannot call ourſelves I:—<hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me;</hi> and in time I ſhall ſee myſelf to live in him, and then I may, and thou mayeſt claim the ſame life, the ſame power with him; for we ſhall return into him who is almighty; 'tis truth, we ſhall be diſſolved in ourſelves, but we ſhall be emptied into him, who is infinitely vaſter than ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſeas or oceans.</p>
                     <p>Ah brother! ſays the other, ſayeſt thou ſo, how can theſe things be? We have heard, that Jeſus Chriſt is God equal with his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; that he is almighty, incomprehenſible, immenſe, &amp;c. We have heard, that he hath all power given him in heaven and in earth, that he rules over all his enemies, and treads them all under his feet; that he rules them with a rod of iron, and cruſhes them in pieces like a potter's veſſel.—In us, behold, there is none of theſe things; we are poor drops and weak creatures; as little as we

Oh! ſaith the other be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented; Corn cannot bring forth fruit ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it die, but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit: Neither can a drop return to the ocean, except it be diſſolved in itſelf, and from its own proper being: So, even ſo we, poor drops in ourſelves, we are nothing, empty, poor deſpiſed nothings, leſs than nothing, apart from the immenſe ocean; but if we can be content to die, and forſake ourſelves, then ſhall we return, and be made one with that immenſe ocean.— Could we but be contented to ſuffer our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be annihilated, and be brought to nothing we ſhould be made ſomething. If that bleſſed ſun of righteouſneſs would but ariſe, diſſolve us, and draw us up into him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, then we, even we, as poor as we be, ſhould be united and made one with the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty. The only reaſon, why we remain ſuch empty drops, is becauſe we eſteem our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be ſomewhat, when indeed we are nothing. Oh theſe high ſwelling towering thoughts muſt be brought down, that ſo God himſelf may take poſſeſſion of us, that we may be joined to the Lord himſelf and ſo be made partakers of his life and glory.

long as thou art ſomething in thyſelf, ſo long thou art nothing, and when thou beginneſt to be nothing in thy own eſteem, then thou beginneſt to be really ſomething; then is Jeſus Chriſt beginning to ariſe and to exalt himſelf in thee—till this work is done. Chriſt is kept under and thyſelf is exalted, and it rules and governs thee and terminates all thy actions, however they may ſeem to thee and to other men, as much lifted up in themſelves as thou art (I ſay) to thee and to others in the ſame ſphere with thee, they ſeem never ſo glorious and beautiful; yet Chriſt is crucified and SELF is alive, and ſet in the throne.

ſtrength we can do nothing; but by his wiſdom and by the communication thereof; by his power of Chriſt, and by his ſtrength in us, we ſhall be more than conquerors; and we ſhall find the words of our Saviour true in ourſelves: <hi>All power is given to me in heaven and earth.</hi>—Then is the day come that God ſhall wipe away tears from thine eyes, and thou ſhalt hear Chriſt himſelf in thee proclaiming, <hi>Behold I make all things new.</hi> Then alſo art thou that bleſſed meek one, ſpoken of, <hi>Mat.</hi> v. <hi>That ſhall inherit the earth.</hi>

that can hold nothing:—Pour riches into him, pour health, pour wealth, pour praiſe, pour honour into him, or pour into him the contrary; whatever ye give to him or take from him, he is all one; if thou ſtrikeſt him on one the cheek, he cannot revenge, he will rather turn the other; curſe him, and he will pray for thee; and this he learns of his dear Saviour Jeſus Chriſt; and this he hath attained by being united, and by being made <hi>one</hi> with him; whoſe practice and command you know it was ſo to do, and whoſe nature and life he partakes of, knowing aſſuredly (by real experience) that there is no other way to find reſt to his ſoul, but by forſaking his own will, and living free in the world and dead unto it and to his own proper will and affections; <hi>dead to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety.</hi> This is the throne of peace and reſt, where <hi>God raiſeth up the poor from the duſt, and lifted up the needy from the dunghill, that he may ſet them with princes, even with the princes of his people,</hi> Pſalm cxiii. 7, 8.—Oh!

But this man is delivered, ſet free from all ſuch things. What a comfort is it, not to fear death, to account death his gain (for this man dies daily) not to fear to anſwer all our enemies in the gate; for death is but one of God's bailiffs? And what care I, which of his collectors, or toll-gatherers ſeize upon me? To look boldly, undauntedly on death, on ſatan, on ſin, as knowing them all overcome and brought under? What a comfort is it to feel and ſee our graces, faith, hope and patience, &amp;c. to revive, to live and flouriſh, which in former times flagged and died? What a comfort is this to ſee, that when either the north wind or the ſouth wind blow, yet ſtill he is ſafe. Let him be in any kind of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, yet his garden proſpers, his ſoul flouriſhes, and the ſpices thereof flow out; nay I will be bold to ſay to this man: No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing is a rod, nothing a judgment; let God do what he will with him, he can ſee no anger, no frowns in any thing, but all that comes, is to him mercies and loving-kindneſſes; he can ſee a great deal of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort in God's rod: <hi>Thy rod and thy ſtaff</hi> (ſaith David) <hi>they comfort me.</hi> Then the rod is no rod, but a favour and a mercy; for he hath expanded, opened and given up him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſolely to God and his will: This is the ſoul that lives with God and lives in God, this ſoul is at reſt, and none elſe but this
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:013145_0059_0F8EC27D672FEFC8"/>
ſoul; for he hath in part poſſeſſion of the kingdom of heaven already, and the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven poſſeſſion of him, he having received the firſt fruits, even while he is in the body: And now is fulfilled, and the days are come, that the bride ſpeaks of, Cant. ii. 11, 12. <hi>For lo!

                     <p>AN eminent ſervant of God, who had known deliverance from the dark powers, and experimentally felt the powers of the world to come, a few hours before his death, expreſſed himſelf in the following words: <q>There is a ſpirit which I feel, that delights to do no evil, nor to revenge any wrong, but delights to endure all things, in hopes to enjoy its own in the end; its hope is to outlive all wrath and conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to weary out all exaltation and cruelty, or whatſoever is of a nature con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to itſelf; it ſees to the end of all temptations; as it bears no evil in itſelf, ſo it conceives none in thought to any other; for its ground and ſpring is the mercies and forgiveneſs of God; its crown is meekneſs; its life is everlaſting love

unfeigned, and takes its kingdom with intreaty, and not with contention, and keeps it by lowlineſs of mind; in God alone it can rejoice, though none elſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard it, or can own its life; 'tis con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in ſorrow, and brought forth with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any to pity it, nor doth it murmur at grief and oppreſſions; it never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joiceth but through ſufferings, for with the world's joy it is murdered.

                  <p>IN the life of the lady ELIZABETH HASTINGS, <note n="*" place="bottom">A very amiable account is given of the extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary charity, piety, &amp;c of this lady, by Sir RICHARD STEEL in the <hi>Tatler,</hi> No. 42, under the character of ASPASIA. She died in 1789.</note> we meet with an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary inſtance of the happy effects, which chriſtianity has upon thoſe who, by
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:013145_0060_0F8EC27E74C333C0"/>
joining with the calls of grace, become will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to give up their whole hearts to follow its dictates. This pious lady's firſt principle appears to have been the glory of God, and the purity of her own heart; next to this, a continual ſolicitude and labour to hold all her capacities, all her power, and all her fortunes continually upon the ſtretch for the good of all men, weeping with thoſe that wept; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing with thoſe that rejoiced; given to the hoſpitality; diſtributing to the neceſſities of ſaints, and to thoſe that were leſs ſo, having joy at the converſion of a ſinner, or the leaſt appearance of it; but the care of all her cares was the ſtranger; the fatherleſs and the widow; the needy, and he that hath no helper; the lame, the halt and the blind.— And in this place, ſays the author of her life, what ſhall I ſay! or how can I expect to be believed! The bent of her ſpirit ever lay to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards theſe: She had a ſhare in all their ſufferings; ſhe would often converſe with them, and enquire into their hiſtory with as much poverty of ſpirit, as they were in of outward condition; ſhe would ſtudy their particular caſes, and put them in the way of better welfare; ſome of theſe were ever in her houſe, and frequently in great numbers; and it was no neglect of her's, if any one went away unrelieved with meat, phyſic, raiment or money; many of theſe that lived
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:013145_0061_0F8EC2820BD24690"/>
remote, had yearly allowances, and large ſums iſſued out into diſtant parts of the kingdom. Her ſtill larger applications were fixed penſions upon reduced families, the maintenance of her own charity-ſchool, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributions to others, &amp;c. &amp;c. She was a great miſtreſs of all parts of oeconomy with reſpect to what ſhe laid out upon herſelf; her body, ſhe knew, was the temple of the Holy Ghoſt, which the believer muſt poſſeſs in ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and honour, wherefore her ſupport of it in meat, drink and ſleep, was ever bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by neceſſity; for they that walk in the ſpirit, as this pious lady did, die progreſſively to every vanity, and dare not indulge the hurtful gratifications of the fleſh, but labour to keep it under, as knowing it to be the ſeat and repoſitory of their moſt dangerous and deadly enemy. Nevertheleſs ſhe ſought not her ſalvation by the force of her alms, highly affluent as they were; for theſe, though neceſſary duties, yet, ſhe well knew, were not the charity of the goſpel; not that charity which the apoſtle Paul ſo divinely deſcribes at 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> xiii. 3. She was ſenſible, that Jeſus Chriſt muſt be revealed in the heart, before we can have any juſt claim to diſcipleſhip, and that it is his ruling and bringing all things therein ſubjection to his ſpirit, that was the great and only principle of chriſtian charity.—She knew, that the
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:013145_0061_0F8EC2820BD24690"/>
great ſcene of religion lay within, in the right government of the heart; accordingly her eye was ever upon her heart, to ſee that all its principles were cleanſed from evil mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, had no taint from ſelf-love, were not ſullied with vain-glory; her care was to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the tendency of all its motions, how its ſtruggles weakened in ſinful deſires, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring continually to nouriſh it by acts of faith in the blood of her Redeemer. She had well learnt to overcome evil with good, to ſuffer long, and be kind, to bear all things, and if ever by ſpeech, carriage or otherwiſe, ſhe ſuſpected that ſhe had diſturbed the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of any, ſhe had no peace with herſelf, till ſhe had taken care for the recovery of theirs.</p>
                  <p>Much more might be ſaid of the endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and virtues of this true diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt, more eſpecially of her patience under ſufferings, and reſignation to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine will; under the painful diſpenſation ſhe paſſed through, during the laſt eighteen months of her life, occaſioned by a cancer in her breaſt, which, notwithſtanding ſhe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered it to be ſeparated from her body, yet in the end occaſioned her death. This pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful operation ſhe not only bore with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, but even rejoiced, that ſhe was count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed worthy to ſuffer, knowing her Saviour had ſuffered in his fleſh, and that as ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings was the way to his perfection, it muſt
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:013145_0062_0F8EC282E3626920"/>
alſo be the way to ours, this being the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared condition of our being glorified with him, the trueſt marks of adoption, and the moſt ſovereign medicine ſent from heaven for our cure. Theſe truths this truly pious lady was ſo well acquainted with, that ſhe declared, <hi>She would not wiſh to be out of her preſent ſituation, nor exchange it for any other at any price.</hi> Thus with great meekneſs and tranquillity, with chearfulneſs ſcarce to be believed, in perfect ſerenity and freedom, ſhe continued her uſual life, till the time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for the operation. When that time of deep trial came, ſhe ſhewed no reluctance or ſtruggle, but endured all even without complaint; only towards the end ſhe drew ſuch a ſigh, as the compaſſionate reader who reads this, may do. Hence it appears, how thoſe that follow the Lamb with ſincerity, are endowed with virtue and power reſulting from the true ſpirit of his religion, which others are unacquainted with. The night following the operation was not indeed a night of much ſleep, but of truly celeſtial reſt; a night of thankſgiving to her God, for the viſible demonſtration of his power in her, and about her, for his ſtretched-out arm in her great deliverance, for the bountiful proviſion he had made for the body and ſoul, holding all the powers of her ſpirit exerciſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in acts of love, gratitude and adoration.
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:013145_0062_0F8EC282E3626920"/>
She ſooner than was expected got upon her feet, and with every improvement that could be made, into the ſame way of life, that ſhe had been in before, wholly intent upon the glory of God, and the good of her fellow-creatures. But the diſtemper only repreſſed for a time, roſe up with new malignity, to the much greater affliction of numbers in the world, than of her that bore it; for ſhe had now been, for ſome time, in the ſchool of affliction, exerciſed with its ſharp diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline, and found its ſalutary effects. Under theſe ſentiments her hope was full of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortality, and the eternal weight of glory, now in full view, made all her afflictions light. In this near and certain approach of death, her cheriſhing warmth, like that of the ſun, tho' it might be moſt felt by thoſe neareſt, yet alſo reached thoſe at greater diſtance; witneſs the great number of letters ſhe writ, and dictated to others, when ſhe became unable to write, full of ſweet counſel, having for their argument the bleſſedneſs of piety; preſſing home the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it, and ſetting forth its true na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; witneſs alſo the number of perſons of all conditions, who reſorted at her houſe, to behold the living power of religion in her, and to be benefited by her wiſdom. With ſome of theſe ſhe continued in heavenly conferences as long as ſhe had ſtrength. Her
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:013145_0063_0F8EC2836782CAB8"/>
life was near drawing to its laſt ſtage, but her lamp and her life muſt be extinguiſhed together, and ſhe muſt occupy till her Lord comes.—Accordingly ſhe convened her houſhold, to ſtrengthen and enforce every thing that ſhe had done or ſhewn them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by her dying counſels; and would have extended this care to the whole village, but was reſtrained by the phyſician. <hi>The path of the juſt is as a ſhining light, which ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth more and more unto the perfect day.</hi> 
                     <q>The truly religious, whoſe evidences for hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven are clear, rational, and well grounded, have a tide of joy ſpringing up in their minds beyond expreſſion; ſomething more moving and ſatisfactory than any one can imagine, but they that perceive it.—When they are juſt entering upon the promiſed land, the ſplendor of the eternal day dawns upon them, and ſhines as thro' the breaches of their ſhattered bodies, and raiſes in the inward man ſuch earneſt of happineſs, ſuch foretaſtes of joy, as enables them to paſs thro' the val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley of death in peace and triumph.</q> As death drew near, ſhe was in tranſport, quite melted down with the impreſſion of glory, broke out with a raiſed accent into theſe words: <hi>Bleſs me,</hi> Lord! <hi>What is that I ſee! Oh! the greatneſs of the glory that is revealed
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:013145_0063_0F8EC2836782CAB8"/>
in me,—that is before me.</hi> And ſome time after ſhe had ſo ſaid, ſhe fell aſleep.</p>
                  <p>And now, reader, let me aſk, What miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes or deluſions did this lady live under; or what wrong judgment did ſhe make of the nature and obligation of our common chriſtianity? Common I call it, for it is one and the ſame to every man, and to every woman, wherever it is known, and to the practice of the eſſential and life-giving part of it, is every man and every woman tied down at their utmoſt peril. And if it be aſked, what theſe are? The anſwer is, That they cannot here indeed be well drawn out in particulars; but two principal ones, to which the reſt are reducible, are, <hi>A firm faith in, and dependance upon,</hi> Chriſt—<hi>And under the help and power of his ſpirit, a mighty labour to perfect that holineſs which he hath taught us.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>All indeed have not this lady's poſſibilities, and cannot give in alms ſevenfold more than they expend upon themſelves; but there is ſcarce one, but may give a cup of cold water, and great things are promiſed even to that, if it is done in a right manner, and with a devont ſpirit. Again, all have not near the ſame diſengagements and leiſure that ſhe had, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

And that all may obtain the grace of God, is certain; for it is common to all. Our gracious and merciful Saviour, the ſure and faithful friend of thoſe who are helpleſs and heavy laden, repeatedly declares it to be ſo, and the whole tenor of the goſpel contains a gracious offer of ſalvation to every ſoul, who in ſincerity prays to God for it.</p>

                     </gap> very inſtructive, and a moſt ſhining pattern of a true ſpiritual conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. 'Tis remarkable, that this perſon who ſerved God with ſuch unwearied prayer and watchfulneſs, was ſo ignorant, that ſhe could neither read nor write, and was in the ſtation of a ſervant, conſtantly employed in buſineſs and hard labour. Hence we ſee, that the true ſervice of God is ſpiritual, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal, plain and eaſy, ſo that no perſon can be excuſed from it by any pretence whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
                  <p>'Tis not ſo much the changing of places, or names, or modes and forms, of any thing without us, as the changing of our will and heart, that will render our ſervice acceptable to God.—Hence the ſcripture declaring, what ſort of change is to be wrought in a ſoul, requires a tranſlation from darkneſs to light, (<hi>Acts</hi> xxvi. 18.) from death to life, (<hi>Eph.</hi> ii. 5.) and from being loſt to be found again.</p>

with a deſign to ſerve and pleaſe him, and if I have time to pray, I fall upon my knees in his holy preſence, and ſpeak to him as if I really ſaw him with my bodily eyes. I give myſelf up wholly to him, and deſire him to fulfil all his holy will in me, and that he would not ſuffer me that day to do the leaſt thing which might be offenſive to him. In ſhort, I love and praiſe him as much and as long as my affairs permit; though very often I have hardly ſo much time as to ſay the Lord's prayer. But I do not trouble myſelf about that; for I have God always in my heart, as well when I am about my buſineſs, which I do in obedience to his will, as when I retire on purpoſe to pray to him. This he himſelf has taught me, that whatever I do out of love to him, is a real prayer.</p>
                  <p>I dreſs myſelf in his preſence, and he ſhews me that his love ſupplies me with raiment. And when I go about my buſineſs, even then doth he not forſake me, nor I him, but he converſes with me; yea, I am then as much united to him, as when I am at my prayers, ſet apart on purpoſe for my ſpiritual recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection. Oh! how ſweet and eaſy is all la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour and toil in ſuch good company!

                  <p>If God at any time hides his face, making as if he would go away from me, I tell him, O! 'tis no matter, my love, conceal thyſelf as much as thou pleaſeſt, nevertheleſs I'll ſerve thee; for I know thou art my God. And then I ſtand upon my guard more than ever, to be faithful to him, for fear of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſing my love.

But he never lets me continue long under theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and if I may venture ſo to ſpeak, he cannot forbear loving me, any more than I can live without him.</p>
                  <p>If I am perſuaded on holidays to be merry in company, I excuſe myſelf. For nothing can be compared to the pleaſures of my love, which are ſo much the ſweeter and greater for my withdrawing from all company whatſoever.

I ſay, I go to ſleep, but being ſtill buſied about the love and praiſes of my God, till I fall quite aſleep. Many times this love rouſes up all my ſenſes, ſo that I cannot ſleep the greateſt part of the night, but I ſpend it in the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces of the grace of God, which never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſakes ſuch a poor miſerable creature as I am, but preſerves me, and takes ſpecial care of me.</p>
                  <p>If in the night the evil ſpirits hover about, to torment or to ſurpriſe me, (which often happens) this divine love guards me, and fights for me. Yea, he gives me grace too, to reſiſt them courageouſly, as if I were awake. For they ſeldom continue long to aſſault me, unleſs it be in my ſleep.</p>
                  <p>And this is the life I have led for theſe twenty years paſt, without perceiving the leaſt change of that love which was poured out into my heart, after my ſincere conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion unto him. Nay, I have obſerved its daily increaſe, tho' every day it ſeemed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to endure any addition to what I already enjoy. But truly, it is an infinite love, which ſatisfies and nouriſhes me, ſo that every day I have a new hunger, tho'
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:013145_0067_0F8EC2891ED02348"/>
methinks I can receive no more, than what I poſſeſs already every moment.</p>
                  <p>THE author of her life ſays, concerning the manner of her expreſſions, that they were always very modeſt, without any noiſe or vehemence: her common diſcourſes were always holy and edifying; whereas others too commonly mis-ſpend their time in uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs converſation and unprofitable talk.</p>
                  <p>For a long while ſhe could bear no other diſcourſe but of God and his holy love. <hi>I I cannot imagine,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>how a ſoul, created for heaven, can be concerned about the droſs of this world.</hi> From that time, if ſhe happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be in company, where the ſubject of the diſcourſe was but indifferent, either ſhe did not mind it at all, entertaining herſelf in the mean while with God; or, as ſoon as ſhe thought it proper, ſhe diverted and changed the diſcourſe; thinking it but loſt time, which was ſpent in the trifles of this world.</p>
                  <p>To every body that had a mind to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with God Almighty ſhe gave this advice: To be ſilent, and to learn to keep their thoughts together in the center of the heart: for this (ſaid ſhe) is the beginning of our union with God, and by theſe means the ſoul forgets earthly things, and raiſes herſelf up to the contemplation of heavenly
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:013145_0067_0F8EC2891ED02348"/>
objects. We ought to loſe our familiarity with the creatures, if we deſire to enjoy the converſation of the Creator; a moment of which doth afford more delight and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, than all the fineſt diſcourſes in the world.</p>
                  <p>The real experience ſhe had of the inward and ſpiritual life of grace, and of the mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold operations it was attended with, doth abundantly appear from the larger account of her life and converſion.</p>
                  <p>One time when her miſtreſs was afraid that Armelle was like to run quite mad by an exceſs of devotion, ſhe forbad her all ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual exerciſes, and would not let her go even to church, except on the Lord's day only: Armelle, being ſenſible of the falſe ſtep her miſtreſs took, ſmiled within herſelf, ſaying, Truly, I am not mad, after I have found my beloved, whom I now love with all my heart. I remember a time, when I was ſeeking only God without me, and then I was mad indeed.—This miſtreſs of hers being of a ſour and moroſe humour, ſhewed a deal of ill-nature to Armelle, of which, however, ſhe never complained, but rather thanked God, that he was pleaſed to make this a means of her fuller purification. Some ſeeing what ſhe ſuffered in that houſe, adviſed her entirely to quit that place; ſhe replied, according to her uſual earneſtneſs:
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:013145_0068_0F8EC28A0762E268"/>
Why ſhould you have me to flee from the croſs which the Lord himſelf has entailed upon me? No, by no means: I ſhall never do it, except they turn me away by force. In which unexpected anſwer her friends en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely aquieſced, never prompting her again to quit a place where ſhe had daily opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to practiſe patience and ſelf-denial; vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues ſo much contrary to the whole bent of corrupt nature, and yet ſo neceſſary for rightly framing a chriſtian life and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation. At another time ſhe ſaid: If the ſoul be but well grounded in the favour of God, and lively affected with the operations of his grace, all the inſults of the devil, and of the creatures, are borne with joy and comfort. But this is miſery indeed, when the Lord himſelf withdraws from the ſoul, and lets her ſhift for herſelf.</p>
                  <p>In what company ſoever ſhe was, ſhe talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of nothing more, than of being <hi>faithful to God.</hi> Nothing dropped more from her mouth, than, <hi>Let us be faithful, let us be faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to the Lord.</hi> This word ſhe thought ſit for any time, and ſuitable to every company. Being aſked by her friends, whether ſhe had nothing elſe to ſay, ſhe anſwered: Don't wonder at my ſaying this over and over again. If I ſhould live a thouſand years, I ſhould ſtill tell you the ſame thing. For 'tis faithfulneſs, wherein the perfection of a chriſtian life conſiſts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="121" facs="unknown:013145_0068_0F8EC28A0762E268"/>Of the conſtraining power of the divine love ſhe has the following expreſſion: When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I happened to adhere a little too much to my natural inclinations, (apt to ſteal in upon the mind under the ſpecious pretence of neceſſity) I was immediately reproved by the love of God. This divine love is like a careful tutor, who takes all the pains imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable for advancing his pupil in the way of learning he is engaged in; and for this rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon keeps his eye conſtantly fixed on him, both to correct his failings, though never ſo ſmall, and to prevent his being led away by any thing that might divert him from his chief employment. Thus, <hi>ſays ſhe,</hi> dealt the Lord with me. He kept me cloſely confined to an holy awe and warineſs; and when I happened by one overſight or other to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw, as it were, from his eye, he in that very moment purſued after me, and recalled me to my duty. But all this was done with ſo much love and tenderneſs, that it muſt be a heart of braſs, if not mollified by ſuch endearing marks of love and kindneſs.</p>
                  <p>She often wondered at ſome people's dila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory doings in the ſervice of God, and ſaid, it was a cunning fetch and ſtratagem of the devil, to make people put off from one day to another ſuch deſigns as might ſerve to advance the glory of God, and the good of our fellow-creatures. <hi>For,</hi> ſaid ſhe, <hi>if often
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:013145_0069_0F8EC28AE8DD22C8"/>
happens that grace which at one hour offers itſelf to a man, in order to ſupport him under ſome diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult enterpriſes, is not ſo eaſily met with at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther time.</hi> And beſides this, how uncertain is our life! nay, if we were ſure to live longer, yet ought we not to linger upon that account at all, nor to defer from one day to another what might be done this day. A man that is full of delays in the ſervice of God, muſt needs have but little love at the bottom. <hi>Wherever love is raiſed to any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable degree, there the ſoul can't reſt, whilſt there remains any thing to be done required by the beloved.</hi>—And this dilatory temper, <hi>ſhe ſaid,</hi> was a great impediment in the way of perfection. Many ſouls were convinced of the will of God, but being too backward conſtantly to ſtruggle againſt the corrupt propenſities of their dull and lazy temper, they made but a ſlow progreſs in the work of religion. They ſay, to-morrow, to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row it ſhall be done in good earneſt; but that to-morrow never comes. The conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence whereof is, that the longer they flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter themſelves in their diſorderly and wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cuſtoms, the leſs able they are to reſiſt them at laſt at all: the Lord leaves them now to their own will, ſince they did not improve faithfully what once they had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="123" facs="unknown:013145_0069_0F8EC28AE8DD22C8"/>Her humility was alſo grounded on a true and ſolid foundation. She confeſſes, that the infinite love of God kept her undefiled as to the vanity of pride. I was aſtoniſhed, ſays ſhe, when I was told to watch againſt pride, for I thought whilſt I was well in my wits, I could not poſſibly be proud. I was ſo fully convinced that every thing really good was from God, that if all angels and men had offered to perſuade me to the contrary, I ſhould never have believed them.—And this ſenſe fortified me againſt every kind of pride.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe her love to God was ſo great and fervent, the love ſhe bore to her fellow-crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures was alſo wonderfully influenced and inflamed thereby.—When ſhe conſidered the woful ſtate of the wicked, and the dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful judgment that is like to befal them at laſt, ſhe then felt a more tender and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſerating love, and her very bowels began to yearn for compaſſion. When ſhe looked upon the happy ſtate ſhe was arrived to, and the ſevere doom attending ſuch proſli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate wretches, ſhe uſed to ſay, ſhe ſeemed unto herſelf like one that had been in a great ſtorm at ſea, and by ſtreſs of weather like to be caſt away every minute; but getting off at laſt ſafe and ſound, remembered now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhore the dangers his brethren and near re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations were ſtill expoſed to, being toſſed up
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:013145_0070_0F8EC28B0FA9E340"/>
and down in the huge ocean, and left to the mercy of the roaring billows. Alas! ſaid ſhe, thus it is with me, when I lay to heart the the danger ſinners run themſelves into. For the more endearing marks of divine grace the Lord has been pleaſed to beſtow upon me, the more fervent is my deſire, that alſo others might partake of the ſame with me.</p>
                  <p>AND now, ye learned men, and refined wits of the age, come hither and admire the ignorance and ſimplicity of this poor coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try-maid! Conſider how far ſhe exceeds your high flown ſuperficial wiſdom, and the dark flaſhes of human wit and learning? And was it poſſible for her to attain to this <hi>heavenly wiſdom and divine knowledge,</hi> to ſuch a nobleneſs and elevation of mind, without the ſcraps and aſſiſtance of artificial learning and philoſophy? then truly there muſt be another ſchool wherein thoſe that <hi>flow unto the Lord,</hi> (Pſ. xxxiv. 5.) <hi>are lighted.</hi> Indeed <hi>to know the love of Chriſt, paſſeth all knowledge,</hi> Eph. iii. 19. Concerning which our Saviour was pleaſed thus to expreſs his grateful ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents with hearty joy and heavenly tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph: <hi>I thank thee, O Father, Lord of heaven and earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes. Even ſo, Father, for ſo it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed good in thy ſight,</hi> Matth. xi. 25, 26.</p>

                  <head>A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE PLAGUE.</head>
                  <p>AMONGST the many calamities with which the Almighty is pleaſed to viſit the children of men, in order to reduce them to a juſt ſenſe of their own weakneſs and entire dependence upon him, there is ſcarce any that are more productive of true penitent humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of a ſight of what is really good and truly evil, than thoſe contagious diſtempers, which an offended God ſometimes ſuffers to rage amongſt the people. In the year 1665 the city of <hi>London</hi> was ſorely viſited by the plague: An account of the progreſs and effects of that viſitation was kept by a citizen who remained there during the whole time of the ſickneſs, and appears to have been candid and judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in his remarks thereon. I truſt my read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers may, in a ſhort deſcription of that memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable judgment, meet with ſuch leſſons of beſt wiſdom, which nothing can ſo effectually pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, as a cloſe and ſerious converſe with death and the grave. The introduction of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion in <hi>London</hi> was by ſome goods imported from <hi>Holland,</hi> which had been brought thither from the <hi>Levant.</hi> It firſt broke out in the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:013145_0072_0F8EC28C783B3F98"/>
houſe where thoſe goods were opened, from whence it ſpread to other houſes. In the firſt houſe that was infected there died four perſons: A neighbour who went to viſit them returning home, gave the diſtemper to her family, and died with all her houſhold. The pariſh officers who were employed about the ſick perſons be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing alſo infected, the phyſicians perceived the danger, and, upon narrow inſpection, aſſured, that it was indeed the plague with all its terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying particulars, and that it threatened a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral infection. The people began now to be alarmed all over the town; the uſual number of burials within the bills of mortality for a week were generally about 240 to 300, but from the 17th to the 24th Jan. the printed bill was 474. However this went off again, and the froſt continuing very ſevere till near the end of February, the bills decreaſed again, and people began to look upon the danger as good as over; but in May the bills greatly increaſed, and the weather becoming hot, the infection ſpread again, in a dreadful manner.</p>
                  <p>I lived, ſays the author, without Aldgate, and as the diſtemper had not reached to that ſide of the city, our neighbourhood continued eaſy; but at the other end of the town the conſternation was very great, and the nobility and gentry thronged out of the town with their families in an unuſual manner; nothing was to be ſeen but waggons, carts and coaches with goods and people, and horſe-men attending them, hurrying away; then empty waggons
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013145_0073_0F8EC28D63AD9B20"/>
and carts appeared, who were apparently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to fetch more people, beſides innumer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able numbers of people on horſeback, fitted out for travelling. This was a very melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly proſpect; indeed there was nothing elſe of moment to be ſeen; it filled my mind with very ſerious thoughts of the miſery that was coming upon the city, and the unhappy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of thoſe that would be left in it. By the end of July the contagion had ſpread and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed to a great degree: Sorrow and ſadneſs ſat upon every face; and though ſome parts were not yet overwhelmed, all looked deeply concerned. <hi>London</hi> might well be ſaid to be all in tears, the mourners did not go about the ſtreets, for nobody made a formal dreſs of mourning for their neareſt relations, but the voice of mourning was indeed heard in the ſtreets; the ſhrieks of women and children at the windows and doors of their houſes where their deareſt relations were dying, were ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent to be heard as we paſſed the ſtreets, that it was enough to pierce the ſtouteſt heart in the world. Tears and lamentations were ſeen almoſt in every houſe, eſpecialiy in the firſt part of the viſitation; for towards the latter end people did not ſo much concern themſelves for the loſs of their friends, expecting that themſelves would be ſummoned the next hour.</p>
                  <p>It was a time of very unhappy breaches a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us; in matters of religion, diviſions and ſeparate opinions prevailed; the Church of <hi>England</hi> was lately reſtored, and the Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>byterians
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013145_0073_0F8EC28D63AD9B20"/>
and other profeſſions had ſet up their meetings for worſhip, apart, in which they were frequently diſturbed, the government endeavouring to ſuppreſs their meetings. But this dreadful viſitation reconciled the different parties, and took away all manner of prejudice and ſcruple from the people. But after the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs was over, that ſpirit of charity ſubſided, and things returned to their own channel again. Here we may obſerve, that a nearer view of death would ſoon reconcile men of good prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to one another, and that it is chiefly owing to our eaſy ſituations in life, and our putting theſe things far from us, that our breaches are ſomented, and that there is ſo much prejudice and want of chriſtian charity and union amongſt us. A cloſe view and converſe with death, or with diſeaſes that threaten death, would ſcum off the gall of our temper, remove our animo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities, and bring us to ſee with different eyes. On the other ſide of the grave we ſhall all be brethren again.</p>
                  <p>The inns of court were now all ſhut up, there was but few lawyers to be ſeen in the city, indeed there was no need of them, for quarrels and diviſions about intereſt had ceaſed; every body was at peace.</p>
                  <p>It was alſo worthy of obſervation, as well as fruitful of inſtruction, to obſerve with what alacrity the people of all perſuaſions embraced the opportunities they had of attending upon the publick worſhip, and other appointed times of devotion, as humiliations, faſtings and pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013145_0074_0F8EC28DDFC37070"/>
confeſſions of ſins, to implore the mercy of God, and avert the judgment which hung over their heads. The churches were ſo throng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that there was often no coming near, no, not to the very door of the largeſt churches. There was alſo daily prayers appointed morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and evening, at which the people attended with uncommon devotion.</p>
                  <p>All plays and interludes which had lately began to increaſe amongſt us, were forbid to act; the gaming-tables, publick dancing-rooms and muſick-houſes, which multiplied and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to debauch the manners of the people, were ſhut up and ſuppreſſed, finding indeed no trade; for the minds of the people were generally humbled and agitated with other things, death was before their eyes, and every body began to think of their graves.</p>
                  <p>The infection ſtill gradually increaſed till the middle of Auguſt, when there died a thouſand a day, by account of the weekly bills, though they never gave a full account by many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands; many of the pariſh officers were taken ſick themſelves and died when their account was to be given in. The pariſh of Stepney alone had within the year, one hundred and ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen ſextons, grave-diggers and carriers of the dead, &amp;c. Indeed the work was not of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to allow them leiſure to take an exact tale of the dead bodies, which were all thrown to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the dark in a pit, to which no man could come near without the utmoſt peril.</p>
                  <p>I had, ſays the author, the care of my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013145_0074_0F8EC28DDFC37070"/>
houſe, which obliged me ſometimes to go abroad. In theſe walks I had diſmal ſcenes before my eyes, as, particularly, of perſons falling dead in the ſtreets, terrible ſhrieks of women, who in their agonies would throw open their chamber-windows, and cry out in a diſmal ſurpriſing manner; it is impoſſible to deſcribe the variety of poſtures in which the paſſions of the poor people would expreſs themſelves. Paſſing through Token-Houſe yard, of a ſudden a caſement violently opened juſt over my head, and a woman gave three frightful ſcreeches, and then cry'd: <hi>Oh! Death, Death, Death,</hi> which ſtruck me with horror and a chilneſs in my very blood. There was nobody to be ſeen in the whole ſtreet, neither did any window open, for people had no curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity now in any caſe. I went on to paſs into <hi>Bell-Alley,</hi> where there was a greater cry than that; I could hear women and children run ſcreaming about the rooms like diſtracted, when a garret-window opened, and ſomebody from a window on the other ſide aſked, <hi>What is the matter?</hi> Upon which it was anſwered, <hi>Oh Lord! my old maſter has hanged himſelf.</hi> The other aſked again, <hi>Is he quite dead?</hi> And the firſt anſwered, <hi>Ay, ay quite dead and cold.</hi> This perſon was a Deputy-Alderman and very rich. But this is but one inſtance; it is ſcarce credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble what dreadful caſes happened in particular families every day. People in the rage of the diſtemper or in the torment of the ſwelling, which was indeed intolerable, becoming raving
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013145_0075_0F8EC2918C8F1A68"/>
and diſtracted, oftentimes laid violent hands upon themſelves, throwing themſelves out of windows, or breaking out of the houſes, would dance naked about the ſtreets, not knowing one extaſy from another; others, if not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, would run directly down to the river, and plunge into the water. Some dying of mere grief as a paſſion, and ſome of fright and ſurprize, without having received the infection. It often pierced my very ſoul, to hear the groans and cries of thoſe who were thus tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented; but this of the ſwellings was account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the moſt promiſing particular in the whole infection; for if theſe ſwellings could be brought to break and run, the patient generally reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered. Whereas thoſe who were ſtruck with death at the beginning of the diſtemper, and had ſpots come upon them, often went about indifferent eaſy, till a little before they died, and ſome till the moment they dropt down; ſuch would be taken ſuddenly very ſick, and would run to ſome convenient place, or to their own houſes if poſſible, and there ſit down, grow faint and die.</p>
                  <p>Death did not now hover over every one's head only, but looked into their houſes and chambers, and even ſtared in their very faces; and though there was ſome ſtupidity and dul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind, yet there was a great deal of juſt alarm ſounded in the inmoſt ſoul: Many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences were awakened; many hard hearts melted into tears; many a penitent confeſſion was made of crimes long concealed. People
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013145_0075_0F8EC2918C8F1A68"/>
might be heard even in the ſtreets as we paſſed along calling upon God for mercy, through Jeſus Chriſt, and ſaying: I have been a thief; I have been an adulterer; I have been a mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer, and the like; and none durſt ſtop to make inquiry into ſuch things, or to admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter comfort to the poor creature, who in the anguiſh both of ſoul and body thus cried out. Many were the warnings that were then given by dying penitents to others, not to put off and delay their repentance to a day of diſtreſs, that ſuch a time of calamity as this was no time for repentance. I wiſh, ſays the author, I could repeat the very ſound of thoſe groans and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations that I heard from ſome poor dying creatures, when in the height of their agonies and diſtreſs, and that I could make him that reads this, hear as I imagine, I now hear them, for the ſound ſeems ſtill to ring in my ears. In the beginning of September the number of burials increaſing, the church-wardens of Ald<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate pariſh ordered a large pit to be dug, to hold all the dead which might die in a month, it was about forty feet long and ſixteen broad; ſome blamed the church-wardens for ſuffering ſuch a frightful gulf to be dug; nevertheleſs in two weeks they had thrown more than eleven hundred bodies into it, when they were obliged to fill it up, as the bodies were come within ſix feet of the ſurface. My curioſity drove me to go and ſee this pit, when there had been near four hundred people buried in it. I got admittance into the church-yard, by
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013145_0076_0F8EC292560BC898"/>
means of the ſexton, who was a ſenſible, reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious man. He would have perſuaded me not to go, ſaying, <hi>That it was indeed their duty to venture, and in it they might hope to be preſerved; but that, as I had no apparent call, he thought, my curioſity could not juſtify my running that hazard.</hi> I told him, <hi>I had been preſſed in my mind to go, and that perhaps it might be an inſtructing ſight. Nay,</hi> ſays the good man, <hi>if you will venture upon that ſcore, in the name of</hi> God <hi>go in; it will be a ſermon to you, it may be the beſt you ever heard in your life.</hi> His diſcourſes had ſhock'd my reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution, and I ſtood wavering for a good while; but juſt then I heard the bell-man, and the cart, loaded with dead bodies, appearing, I went in. There was nobody, as I could perceive, at firſt with the cart but the buriers, and the man that led the cart; but when they came to the pit, they ſaw a man muffled in a cloak who appeared in great agony; the buriers immediately gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about him, ſuppoſing he was one of thoſe poor delirious or deſperate creatures, that would ſometimes run to the pit, wrapt in blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets, and throw themſelves in, and as they ſaid, bury themſelves. When the buriers came to him, they ſoon found he was neither deſperate nor diſtempered in mind, but one oppreſſed with a dreadful weight of grief, having his wife and ſeveral children all in the cart, that was juſt come in with him, and he followed in agony and exceſs of ſorrow. He calmly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired the buriers to let him alone, ſaid he would only ſee the bodies thrown in, and go away;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013145_0076_0F8EC292560BC898"/>
ſo they left importuning him. But no ſooner was the cart turned round, and the bodies ſhot into the pit promiſcuouſly, which was a ſurpriſe to him, for he at leaſt expected, they would have been decently laid in, though indeed he was afterwards convinced that was impracti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, I ſay, no ſooner did he ſee the ſight, but he cryed out aloud, unable to contain himſelf, and fell down in a ſwoon; the buriers ran to him, and took him up, and when he was come to himſelf, led him to a place where he was taken care of. He looked into the pit again, as he went away, but the buriers had covered the bodies ſo immediately with throwing earth, that nothing could be ſeen. The cart had in it ſixteen or ſeventeen bodies. Some were wrapt up in linen ſheets, ſome in rugs, ſome little other than naked, or ſo looſe, that what covering they had fell from them, in the ſhooting out of the cart, and they fell quite naked among the reſt; but the matter was not much to them, or the indecency much to any one elſe, ſeeing they were to be huddled to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether into the common grave of mankind; for here was no difference made, but poor and rich went together; there was no other way of burials, neither was it poſſible there ſhould.</p>

                     <hi>John Hayward,</hi> under-ſexton, that is, grave digger and bearer of the dead, never had the diſtemper at all, but lived about twenty years after it. His wife was employed to nurſe the infected people; yet ſhe herſelf never was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected. The only preſervative he uſed againſt
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013145_0077_0F8EC292694BDA88"/>
the infection, was holding garlick and rue in his mouth, and ſmoaking tobacco; this I had from his own mouth. His wife's remedy was waſhing her head in vinegar, and ſprinkling her head-clothes ſo with vinegar, as to keep them always moiſt; and if the ſmell of any of thoſe ſhe waited on was more than ordinary offenſive, ſhe ſnuffed vinegar up into her noſe, ſprinkled her head-clothes and held a hanker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief wetted with vinegar to her mouth.</p>
                  <p>And here I muſt not omit mentioning the diſpoſition of the people of that day, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their charity to the poor, which indeed was very large both in a publick and a private way. Some pious ladies were ſo zealous in this good work, and ſo confident in the protection of providence, in the diſcharge of this great duty, that they went about themſelves diſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buting alms, and viſiting the poor families that were infected, in their very houſes, appointing nurſes and apothecaries to ſupply them with what they wanted; thus giving their bleſſings to the poor in ſubſtantial relief, as well as hearty prayers for them. I will not undertake to ſay, that none of theſe charitable people were ſuffered to die of the plague, but this I may ſay, that I never knew any of them miſcarried, which I mention for the encouragement of others in caſe of like diſtreſs; and doubtleſs, if they, <hi>that give to the poor, lend to the Lord, and he will repay it,</hi> thoſe that hazard their lives to give to the poor, and to comfort and aſſiſt them in ſuch a miſery as this, may hope to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected therein.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="unknown:013145_0077_0F8EC292694BDA88"/>From the middle of Auguſt to the middle of September the infection ſtill increaſed and ſpread itſelf, with an irreſiſtible fury; it was reckoned, that during that time there died no leſs than ſixteen hundred a day, one day with another. It was then that the confuſion and terror was inexpreſſible; the courage of the people appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to carry away the dead, began to fail them; the vigilance of the magiſtrates was now put to the utmoſt trial. At laſt the violence of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temper came to ſuch a height that the people ſat ſtill looking at one another, and ſeemed quite abandoned to deſpair. In a word, people began to give themſelves up to fear, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to be expected but a univerſal deſolation. This deſpair made people bold and venturous, they were no more ſhy of one another, as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting there was now no avoiding the diſtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, but that all muſt go, this brought them to crowd into the churches, they inquired no more what condition the people who ſat near them were in, but looking upon themſelves alſo as ſo many dead corps, they came to the churches without the leaſt caution, and crowded together, as if their lives were of no conſequence, compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to the work which they were come about: Indeed, their zeal in coming, and the earneſtneſs and affectionate attention they ſhewed to what they heard, made it manifeſt what value peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple would put upon the worſhip of God, if they thought, every day they attended at the church, would be their laſt. It was in the height of this deſpair, that it pleaſed God to
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013145_0078_0F8EC29323E262D8"/>
ſtay his hand, and to ſlacken the fury of the contagion, in a manner as ſurpriſing as that of its beginning, and which demonſtrated it to be his own particular hand above the agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of means; nothing but omnipotent power could have done it; the contagion, deſpiſed all medicine; death raged in every corner, and had it gone on as it did then, a few weeks more would have cleared the town of all its inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. In that very moment when thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand were dead in three weeks, nay, when it was reported three thouſand died in one night, and an hundred thouſand more were taken ſick, when we might well ſay, <hi>Vain was the help of man,</hi> it pleaſed God to cauſe the fury of it to abate, and by his immediate hand to diſarm the enemy. It was wonderful! The phyſicians were ſurpriſed, wherever they viſited, to find their patients better, and in a few days every body was recovering: Nor was this by any medicine found out, or any new method of cure diſcovered, but it was evidently from the ſecret inviſible hand of him that had at firſt ſent this diſeaſe, as a judgment upon us. Let the philoſophers ſearch for reaſons in nature to account for it, and labour as much as they will to leſſen the debt they owe to their maker; thoſe phyſicians who had the leaſt ſhare of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in them, were obliged to acknowledge, that it was all ſupernatural. The ſtreets were now full of poor recovering creatures, who appeared very ſenſible and thankful to God for their unexpected deliverance: Yet I muſt own,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013145_0078_0F8EC29323E262D8"/>
that as for the generality of the people, it might too juſtly be ſaid of them, as was ſaid of the children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> after they had been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered from the hoſt of <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> that <hi>they ſung his praiſe, but they ſoon forgot his works.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The author, who was preſerved unhurt with his whole family, during the time of the ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, gives in his memoirs a particular account of the many reaſonings and fears which affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his mind, before he could come to a fixed concluſion, whether to ſtay, and take his lot in the ſtation in which God had placed him, or by leaving the city, run the hazard of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettling himſelf, and loſe his effects which lay ſcattered among the merchants. At the earneſt ſolicitations of his brother he had concluded to go; but being always croſſed in this deſign by ſeveral accidents, it came one morning, as he expreſſes it, very warmly in his mind, whether theſe repeated diſappointments were not intimations to him, that it was the will of heaven he ſhould not go, which was ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a further thought, that if this ſuggeſtion was from God, he was able effectually to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve him in the midſt of all deaths and dangers that would ſurround him, and that if he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſecure himſelf, by fleeing from his habitation, and acted contrary to theſe intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which he believed to be divine, it was a kind of flying from God, who could cauſe his juſtice to overtake him, when and where he thought fit.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="16" facs="unknown:013145_0079_0F8EC293E070CF40"/>But what finally ſixed him in a reſolution to ſtay, and caſt himſelf entirely upon the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and good pleaſure of the Almighty, was, that at a time, when his thoughts were more than commonly ſerious upon this weighty ſubject, turning over the bible which lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him, he cried out, <hi>Well, I know not what to do, Lord direct me!</hi> at that juncture happening to ſtop and caſting his eye on the ſecond verſe of the 91ſt Pſalm, he read to the 10th, as follows, viz. <hi>I will ſay of the Lord, he is my refuge and my fortreſs, my God, in him will I truſt. Surely he ſhall deliver thee from the ſnare of the fowler, and from the noiſome peſtilence. He ſhall cover thee with his feathers, and under his wings ſhalt thou truſt: His truth ſhall be thy ſhield and buckler. Thou ſhalt not be afraid for the terror by night, nor for the arrows that flieth by day, nor for the peſtilence that walketh in darkneſs, nor for the deſtruction that waſteth at noon-day. A thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſhall fall at thy ſide, and ten thouſand at thy right hand; but it ſhall not come nigh thee. Only with thine eyes ſhalt thou behold and ſee the reward of the wicked. Becauſe thou haſt made the Lord which is thy refuge, even the moſt high thy habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: There ſhall no evil befall thee, neither ſhall any plague come nigh thy dwelling,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>OBSERVING ſome years ago the dreadful havock made by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive uſe of diſtilled ſpirituous liquors in this part of the world, I was induced to inſert in one of the almanacks an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of what had been written on that ſubject by Dr. Hales, fellow of the Royal Society, containing his own remarks, with the ſentiments of ſeveral perſons of note in the phyſical way; whoſe knowledge of the nature of diſtilled liquors, as well as of their effects on the human frame, beſt qualified them to give a right judgment thereon. And as the exceſſive and indeed miſtaken uſe of theſe liquors continues, and rather increaſes, on this Continent, 'tis thought a republication of thoſe ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013145_0082_0F8EC2998F8D1058"/>
with ſome additions, may, thro' divine bleſſing, be beneficial to many; particularly to ſome well-minded people, who are under miſtaken prejudices on this moſt intereſting ſubject. "My principal and indeed only motive," ſays this bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent author, <q>is to endeavour to rouſe the caution and indignation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, againſt thoſe mighty deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and debaſers of the human ſpecies, <hi>fermented diſtilled ſpirituous liquors;</hi> thoſe worſe than infernal ſpirits, which bewitch and infatuate the nations with their ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceries.</q>—An evil ſo amazingly great, that did not woeful experience too fully prove it, it ſeems incredible, that any whom it concerns could poſſibly be ſo neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent, as not to uſe their utmoſt endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſuppreſs this deſtructive <hi>man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bane.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That eminent phyſician Dr. Hoffman expreſly cautions againſt the uſe of diſtil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſpirituous liquors. "Becauſe," ſays he, <q>they are, above all things, moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wholeſome, being cauſtic burning ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits; which, by inflaming the ſolids, and thickening the fluids, cauſe obſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, which bring on many fatal diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, ſuch as hectick fevers, jaundices, dropſies, &amp;c. whereby multitudes are yearly and daily deſtroyed.</q> He alſo
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013145_0082_0F8EC2998F8D1058"/>
obſerves, <q>that they rot the entrails, ſuch as the liver, ſtomach and bowels; as it is evident, not only by opening the bodies of thoſe who are killed by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, but alſo by what is obſerved in Germany of the effect which the cauſtic, fiery, remaining waſh of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtillers, has on the guts of hogs; which are thereby ſo tendered, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make puddings with them.</q>—He farther obſerves, <q>That the fleſh of ſuch hogs will not keep, even when ſalted, ſo well as the fleſh of other hogs.</q> Dr. Cheyne, in his eſſay of health and long life, ſays, <q>All people, who have any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to their health and lives, ought to tremble at the firſt cravings for ſuch poiſonous liquors. The maladies begot by them, bring forth neceſſity upon ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of drams and gills; till, at laſt, a kind dropſy, nervous convulſion, flux, if not a fever, or phrenzy, ſets the poor ſoul free. It has often raiſed in me the moſt melancholly reflections, to ſee the virtuous and ſenſible, bound in ſuch chains and fetters, as nothing leſs than omnipotent grace or the unrelenting grave could releaſe them from.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doctor Short, in his hiſtory of mineral waters, page 225. ſays, <q>The oftner I reflect on the miſchief done by diſtilled
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013145_0083_0F8EC29A840501C8"/>
ſpirits, the more I am confirmed, that the human race had been happier had drams never been known: and I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not help cordially joining with Doctor Allen, in his Synopſis Medici, A. 1633. <hi>That the plentiful devouring of thoſe ſpirits has killed as many thouſands of men, as there are ſtars in the ſky. Nay, ten times ten thouſands have died by theſe, more than all the reſt of the poiſons what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi>
                     </q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doctor Lind, in his treatiſe on the ſcur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy, ſays, <q>He obſerved moſt deſtructive diſtempers to be much increaſed, even to mortality, by diſtilled ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors; which ſailors are too apt gree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily to ſwallow down.</q> And Doctor Hales obſerves, from the remarks made to him by an eminent ſurgeon, <q>That the ſtomachs of great dram-drinkers were contracted into half the common natural ſize, and hard; ſomewhat like leather, that had been held to the fire. The conſequence of which was, loſs of appetite, and a waſting conſumption.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>It is pretended, that drams comfort, warm, and defend from the ſeverity of weather, to which men are ſometimes ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed; without which, they ſay, they ſhould periſh with cold; which is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, in a great meaſure, true of thoſe
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013145_0083_0F8EC29A840501C8"/>
who are habituated to drink them; the blood of ſuch being thereby ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed, that it is well known many of the drinkers of drams are cold and lifeleſs in the midſt of ſummer, without frequent repetitions: this is what ſome of them have owned. But on the other hand, how much more able are ſober per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to endure cold and hardſhips? their vital heat not being extinguiſhed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance, does, by its kindly genial warmth, more effectually ſecure them from the inclemency of the weather, than the falſe flaſh of a dram. Beſides, it is well known, that men did not periſh in the coldeſt countries for want of drams formerly, when they were not to be had. Of the undoubted truth of this, Captain Ellis gives a full proof in the account of his voyage to Hudſon's Bay, page 199. Where he obſerves, <q>That the natives on the very cold coaſt, of that Bay, to whom the French are kinder than to ſell diſtilled ſpirituous liquors, are tall, hardy, robuſt and active; whereas thoſe of them that are ſupplied with drams from the Engliſh, are a meagre, dwarf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh, indolent people, hardly equal to the ſeverity of the country, and ſubject to many diſorders.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="8" facs="unknown:013145_0084_0F8EBA88D0BBA548"/>And as to the pernicious effects of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous liquors in very hot climates, (as on the coaſt of Guinea) it is obſerved, that the French and Portugueſe, who do not indulge in diſtilled ſpirits, are healthy compared with the Engliſh; who, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing freely of ſpirits, &amp;c. die faſt. Thus, alſo, it is obſerved of the women in the Weſt-Indies, that being ſober, they live long; but it is often otherwiſe with the men, who are more generally intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate.</p>
                  <p>The unhappy dram-drinkers are ſo ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely bound in ſlavery to theſe infernal ſpirits, that they ſeem to have loſt the power of delivering themſelves from this worſt of bondage. How much then is it the bounden duty of thoſe, who have it in their power, to with-hold this deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive <hi>man-bane,</hi> either as parents, maſters, or rulers to the people committed to their truſt.</p>
                  <p>Since then the evil is become ſo noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly epidemical as to debilitate and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy multitudes, in moſt parts of the world; it behoves all, who have any bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els of pity for their fellow-creatures, more eſpecially the governors of the nations, as guardians and tender fathers, to guard the people committed to their charge from this <hi>mighty deſtroyer.</hi> Can there be any
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013145_0084_0F8EBA88D0BBA548"/>
conſideration, of ſufficient weight, to the contrary. Is it ſound policy to encourage vice in the people, becauſe a preſent re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue ariſes from their debaucheries? Where will the revenue be, when the people, who ſhould pay them, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed? Are not a hardy, induſtrious healthy people, always found to be the moſt able to contribute amply to the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of government? And will not tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, in the end, be found a more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual means to increaſe the real wealth and ſtrength of a nation, than to make drunkenneſs the cheapeſt of vices? But if the conſideration of the inhumanity of being inſtrumental to the deſtruction of multitudes, and in a manner, in ſome parts of the world, of whole nations, is not of weight enough to influence; yet, ſure, the awful conſideration, that it muſt needs be highly diſpleaſing to our merci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Creator, to have his favourite creature man thus debaſed, diſgraced, and deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed both in body and ſoul, ought to have its due weight. Can it in reaſon be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that he will always remain an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned ſpectator of ſuch aſtoniſhing proceedings? And will he not in mercy viſit the nations for theſe things, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the ſtill much greater ruin of future generations, in conformity to his uſual
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013145_0085_0F8EC29ADA2C3200"/>
method of proceeding, when irregulari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties are arrived to great exceſſes? This diſeaſe has now attained to ſo enormous a pitch, that it is much to be feared no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing leſs than God's ſevere fatherly cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, will effectually cure it in many of the nations; who ſeem as ſupine and unconcerned about it, as if only ſo many thouſands of locuſts were deſtroyed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by: for if in fifty or ſixty years this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive peſt has ſpread thus far and wide, how vaſtly greater will the havock a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt mankind be in an hundred years more, if ſome check be not put to its career?</p>
                  <p>If it had been ſaid, an hundred years ago, to any of the rulers of the nations, that they ſhould patiently, and even un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concernedly, ſee ſuch multitudes of their ſubjects deſtroyed both body and ſoul, and that only for ſiltny lucre; would they not, with indignation, have ſaid as Hazael did to Eliſha, 2 Kings viii. 13. <q>
                        <hi>But what is thy ſervant a dog, that he ſhould do this great thing?</hi>
                     </q> The plain truth is, that it is with the nations as it fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently happens to private perſons, that when they grow gradually from bad to worſe, they, at the ſame time, become more and more hardened, ſo as to be even reconciled to practices for which they had
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013145_0085_0F8EC29ADA2C3200"/>
at firſt the utmoſt deteſtation and abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence; for familiarity takes away our at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, and robs things of their power to ſtrike ſtrongly upon us.</p>
                  <p>Though thouſands and tens of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands periſh every year by diſtilled ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous liquors, yet few appear to lay it effectually to heart. I muſt here except the heads of the poor wild Indians, of the Six Nations ſituate back of New-York, and other parts of North-America, who being ſenſible of the great deſtruction made a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt them by diſtilled ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, have long ſince, and do ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, earneſtly to deſire, that no ſuch ſpirit ſhould be ſold to their people. At a treaty held at Carliſle in this province, with the deputies of the Six Nations, the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares and other weſtern Indians, in the year 1753, Scarrooyady, one of the chiefs of the Six Nations, ſpeaking on behalf of all the Indians preſent, expreſſed himſelf to the following effect, viz. <q>The rum ruins us: we beg you would prevent its coming in ſuch quantities, by regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the traders. We never under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the trade was for whiſkey <note n="*" place="bottom">A ſpirit made of grain.</note>. We deſire it may be forbidden, and none
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013145_0086_0F8EC29B608C7560"/>
ſold in the Indian country; but that if the Indians will have any, they may go amongſt the inhabitants, and deal with them for it. When theſe whiſkey tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders come, they bring thirty or forty cags, puts them down before us, and make us drink, and get all the ſkins that ſhould go to pay the debts we have contracted, for goods bought of the fair trader; and by theſe means, we not only ruin ourſelves, but them too. Theſe wicked whiſkey ſellers, when they have once got the Indians in liquor, make them ſell their very clothes from their backs. In ſhort, if this practice be continued, we muſt be inevitably ruined. We moſt earneſtly, therefore, beſeech you to remedy it.</q> The Indian ſpeaker gave, as is uſual with them in matters of moment, a treble ſtring of wampum, in confirmation of this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. The deſtructive effect of diſtilled ſpirits, have alſo extended their baneful influence amongſt the people of Africa. It is, in a great meaſure, through the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction of thoſe infernal ſpirits, that the poor negroes have been as it were bewitched, and prevailed upon to capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate their unhappy country people, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to bring them to the European mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket: hence devaſtation, bloodſhed and mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013145_0086_0F8EC29B608C7560"/>
have ſpread in their land; many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, and hundreds of thouſands, have been doomed to a miſerable thraldom; and many, very many, brought to a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el and untimely end: innumerable in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances might be mentioned, to confirm this melancholy truth; of which I ſhall mention two, <hi>viz.</hi> Andrew Brue, the noted French factor, who reſided ſixteen years in Guinea, tells us, <q>That, in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, brandy is the beſt commodity amongſt the negroes, as they love it to exceſs: that it is eaſy, from hence, to eſtimate the vaſt profit made by the company, when its ſtore-houſe is well provided with this liquor.</q> And Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis Moor, the Engliſh factor, in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of Africa, ſays, <q>That it was to the king of Barſailly's inſatiable thirſt for brandy, that his ſubjects freedom and families were in ſo precarious a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation,</q> &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>It is no uncommon thing for habitual rum-drinkers, when a fit of ſickneſs comes on, which they conclude will be their laſt, to deſire to have plenty of rum by them; by which means, they continue intoxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated till death: to ſo aſtoniſhing and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plorable a ſottiſh condition have they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced themſelves! This is a caſe ſo cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitous to mankind, that to have a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013145_0087_0F8EC29C387CEC18"/>
ſenſe of it, and yet not to remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate, nor earneſtly caution againſt it, is certainly as criminal as it is unfriendly not to warn a blind perſon of a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous precipice or pit; yet, alas! how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned are the greateſt part of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind at this moſt enormous ruin of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes! In trials for life, what diligence is uſed to find the occaſion of the loſs of one ſubject! What care will not a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful phyſician beſtow for the preſervation of one life! How did the wiſe Romans honour him, who ſaved the life of one Roman citizen! But in the preſent caſe, it is not one, nor one hundred, nor one thouſand, but probably no leſs than a million that periſh, yearly, by this worſt of plagues. How then dare the gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors of nations be unconcerned or ſilent in a cauſe in which humanity, virtue, and the real welfare of mankind, both civil and religious, are ſo deeply concerned? A cauſe, which tends not only to the weakening the faculties, enervating the bodies of men, but alſo in debaſing the ſpecies, and ſhortening the lives of mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes.</p>
                  <p>But the moſt afflictive and dreadful ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect of the common uſe of diſtilled ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquors, are, that it not only height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens the paſſions of men and depraves their
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013145_0087_0F8EC29C387CEC18"/>
morals; but what is infinitely worſe, and ought to be <hi>an awakening</hi> conſideration, they become prophane and abandoned, and to the laſt degree regardleſs of their duty to God and man; the feelings of the mind are gradually benumb'd, and an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſibility to the healing influence of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion enſues.</p>
                  <p>The Almighty who has ſo curiouſly wrought our wonderful frame out of the duſt, knowing how prone we are to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order it by irregularities, hath of his ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der fatherly care of us, not only implant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in us a ſtrong deſire of life and ſelf-pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, but has alſo ſtrictly warned us to avoid all deſtructive irregularities and vices, and to practiſe thoſe virtues which are ſo well adapted to our nature, that they have a direct tendency to give health to the ſoul, as well as marrow to the bones, Prov. cxi. 8. Yet how is this delicate, this curiouſly wrought frame, abuſed and diſordered by repeated irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities of many kinds, but never be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the enormous degree that it has of late years arrived at by the exceſſive abuſe of theſe fermented, diſtilled ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquors, which, by their miſchievous effects, ſeem to claim Satan himſelf for their author. The benevolent author firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned from whoſe collection great part of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013145_0088_0F8EC29CF816A480"/>
the foregoing is collected, obſerves, <q>That if any of his readers ſhould think the ſubject is overpreſſed, ſuch are deſired to conſider that the calamitous urgency of the caſe abſolutely requireth the moſt pathetical expoſtulation, to rouſe the attention and indignation of mankind, againſt this greateſt of all plagues that ever befel unhappy man, which is both our ſin and our moſt ſevere puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Dr. Cheyne farther obſerves, <q>That if only the profligate, the ſcoundrel, the abandoned run into theſe exceſſes, it were as vain to endeavour to reclaim them, as it were to ſtop a tempeſt, or calm a ſtorm: But that now the vice is become epidemical, ſince it has got not only among mechanics and tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, but among perſons of the bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt genius, the fineſt taſte, and the moſt accompliſhed parts. And oh! that I could (adds the doctor) give my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience the lye in not mentioning them, even among the firſt and leaſt fallen part of the creation itſelf, and thoſe of them too, of the moſt elegant parts and the ſtricteſt virtue, even of thoſe who are in other reſpects blameleſs. Since the caſe is ſo, it will not be amiſs to ſhew, to the evidence of a demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013145_0088_0F8EC29CF816A480"/>
the folly as well as fruitleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſuch a courſe. A fit of the colick, or of the vapours; a family misfortune; the death of a child, or of a friend, with the aſſiſtance of the nurſe or the next neighbour, often gives riſe and becomes the weighty cauſes of ſo fatal an effect. A little lowneſs requires drops, which paſs readily down under the notion of phyſic: Drops beget drams, and drams beget more drams, till they come to be without weight and without meaſure—did this bewitching poiſon ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually cure or relieve them from time to time, ſomething might be ſaid to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenuate the folly and the frenzy of ſuch a courſe, but on the contrary, it height<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens and enrages all their ſymptoms and ſufferings ever afterwards, excepting the few moments immediately after taking it down; and every dram be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gets the neceſſity of two more to cure the ill effects of the firſt, and one mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute's indulgence they purchaſe with many hours of greater pain and miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, beſides making the malady more incurable. Low ſpiritedneſs itſelf is no diſeaſe; beſides there are remedies that will relieve it ſo long as there is any oil remaining in the lamp.—Exerciſe, abſtinence and proper evacuations, with
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013145_0089_0F8EC29DE1E11C68"/>
time and patience, will continually make it tolerable; very often they will perfectly cure. The running into drams is giving up the whole at once, for neither laudanum nor arſenick will kill more certainly, altho' more quickly.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>The miſtaken uſe and grievous abuſe of rum and other diſtilled ſpirits, perhaps in no caſe appear more palpably than at the time of harveſt, a buſineſs which, under the Moſaic Diſpenſation, was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly enjoined to be carried on with humiliation and thankſgiving, and ought by all means, to be obſerved as ſuch under the goſpel; but through the abuſe of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous liquors, is made an occaſion of a greater abuſe of the creature and diſhonour of the Creator; this ariſes, in many, from a miſtaken perſuaſion that hard labour, particularly that of the harveſt field, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be carried on without a quantity of rum or other diſtilled ſpirits; and in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of this opinion, we are frequently told of the many people who have died in the field through extream heat and fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, and it is ſuppoſed that many more would die, if a plentiful uſe of ſpirituous liquors was not allowed. But this I am perſuaded is a great miſtake, it being much more likely that the free uſe of rum occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned the death of thoſe people; the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013145_0089_0F8EC29DE1E11C68"/>
quantity they had ſwallowed down, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a greater flow of ſpirits into the head than the ſtrength of the body could ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port. Indeed the repeated large quantities of rum commonly drank during the whole time of harveſt, keeps up the blood in a continual ſerment and fever, in which ſtate people cannot have a proper reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſleep; their conſtitutions are thereby enervated, their lives ſhortened, and an unfitneſs for religious impreſſions general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly prevails.</p>
                  <p>Theſe moſt ſolemn and weighty conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, have induced ſome well-mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people to endeavour to lead, by their example <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> their friends and neighbours into a contrary practice; and under theſe attempts, experience has made it manifeſt, that very little or no ſtrong liquor is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary at thoſe times; indeed they have been convinced that the harveſt and other laborious work, can be very well manag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without making uſe of any ſpirituous liquors at all. If ſuch labour was carried on with ſteadineſs and proper moderation, there would certainly be no need of a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit of ſtrength being ſought for by that means; more frequent intervals of reſt, with a little food, oftener allowed the reapers, and ſmall drinks; ſuch as molaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and water made agreeable with a little
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013145_0090_0F8EC1FB0B572320"/>
cyder, ſmall beer, or even milk and wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, would fully enable them to perform their work to their employer's ſatisfaction and their own advantage; and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plus wages they would receive, inſtead of the ſpirituous liquors uſually given, might be ſufficient to purchaſe bread for their families.</p>
                  <p>This ſober and moderate manner of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding was certainly the general practice in this province, for a conſiderable num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of years after its firſt ſettlement, when but ſmall quantities of ſtrong liquors, and often none at all could be procured<note n="*" place="bottom">In a printed oration, not long ſince pronounced by Dr. Ruſh, before the Philoſophical Society of this city, we are told at page 65, <q>Some of you may remember the time, and your fathers have told thoſe of us who do not, when the diſeaſes of Pennſylvania were as few and as ſimple as thoſe of the Indians. The food of the inhabitants was then ſimple; their only drink was water; their appetites were reſtrained by labour: religion ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded the influence of ſickening paſſions: private hoſpitality ſupplied the want of public hoſpitals: nature was their only nurſe: temperance their principal phyſician.</q>
                     </note>, The people in thoſe early times maintained their health, and were enabled to perform their labour to ſatisfaction. But this did not long continue, the great call for our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions

viſions brought us into connections with thoſe countries from whence rum was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured; and the deſire of gain has ſince in a progreſſive encreaſe, induced our traders to bring us plenty of diſtilled ſpirits, and together with them <hi>diſeaſes and death</hi> in return for our flour, and other uſeful pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce. So early as the year 1728,<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>Extract from the Pennſylvania Gazette, for the year 1728. Philadelphia, the 7th of the 11th month, 1728, we have the following ſurprizing tho' authentick account of rum imported in Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania the laſt year.</p>
                        <list>
                           <item>6 Puncheons,</item>

                        <p>Which, by computation is 224,500 gallons, of which there was exported but 11400 gallons.</p>
                        <p>So that by a modeſt computation there <hi>has been</hi> conſumed in one year, at leaſt twenty five thouſand pounds in rum. This exceſſive drinking of rum, as it has ſlain its thouſands, is likely to deſtroy its ten thouſands, for by its corroſive and fiery property, it debauches the ſtomach, dries up the radical moiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, poiſons the juices, inflames the blood; un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheaths the bowels, debilitates the nerves and ſtupi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies the brain.</p>
                     </note> we find the introduction and conſumption, of rum had made an amazing progreſs, and began to rouſe the attention of ſome of the conſiderate, may I not ſay, of the lovers of their country in that day. And from the too apparent general uſe, there is
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013145_0091_0F8EC1FBA37DA9B0"/>
no room to ſuppoſe but that it has gone on in an increaſed proportion to our numbers; tho' not now ſo eaſily aſcertained, from the additional numbers of ports, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious means of procuring it: Nor ought we to omit, in ſuch accounts, the large quantities of whiſky and other liquors diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilled amongſt ourſelves from grain, fruit, and molaſſes, which cannot well be calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated.</p>
                  <p>I have heard of ſeveral thoughtful peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple who, from a perſuaſion that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon method of giving ſpirituous liquors to labourers was exceeding hurtful, have made it a condition with thoſe they have employed, not to uſe any ſpirituous liquors in their fields; theſe have had their work performed to good ſatisfaction, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any damage enſuing to their labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Nay, where they have remained any conſiderable time with ſuch employers, they have generally acknowledged them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves ſenſible of the benefit ariſing from having thus totally refrained the uſe of thoſe liquors. A particular inſtance of this kind occurred laſt ſummer, in the caſe of Joſhua Evans, of Haddonfield; this conſiderate perſon being convinced that the uſe of rum and other ſpirituous liquors, was extreamly hurtful to the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring people; more eſpecially during
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013145_0091_0F8EC1FBA37DA9B0"/>
the time of harveſt, apprehended it to be his duty, to become an example in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to this pernicious cuſtom; and he concluded to run all riſques of loſs and da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, which might happen to himſelf by the delay of bringing in his harveſt, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than comply with a cuſtom which he apprehended to be ſo deſtructive of his fellow <hi>men.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>He therefore offered ſix-pence per day more than other farmers, to ſuch labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers as were willing to aſſiſt in bringing in his harveſt, on condition that no ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous liquors ſhould be uſed in his fields. Notwithſtanding the ſingularity of ſuch a propoſal, a ſufficient number of labour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers offered themſelves, to whom he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, That the hurrying manner in which the people drove on their labour in the harveſt field, cauſed an unnatural fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and heat in their bodies, and of courſe an exceſſive thirſt enſued, which often occaſioned their drinking water, or ſmall liquors, in ſuch immoderate degree as to become hurtful and very dangerous, that this was generally aſſigned as a rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for the uſe of ſpirituous liquors: That, in order to avoid theſe extremes, he propoſed to lead them himſelf in the harveſt work, deſiring they would go no faſter than he did; they acted according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013145_0092_0F8EC20140DFFBD8"/>
and his corn was cut down and brought in as well, if not better, than ever it had been before; and tho' the people drank little but water or milk and water, chuſing it rather than cyder and water, or ſmall beer, which they were not uſed to; they went thro' their buſineſs with ſatisfaction to him and themſelves. This perſon has purſued the ſame courſe with labourers he has hired for other work; who, tho' ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to ſpirituous liquors, after having ſerved him ſeveral days, have frankly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged they had done very well <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out them,</hi> finding themſelves in a better ſtate both of body and mind, than when they began to work for him.</p>
                  <p>This is a plain inſtance in contradiction to the common prejudice, that labouring people cannot with ſafety perform their work without uſing thoſe liquors. Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral more examples might be inſtanced of ſome conſiderate people who have made it a rule not to make any uſe of ſpirituous liquors, either amongſt their workmen in the proſecution of their trades, or on their plantations. To theſe experience has ſhewn, that their people could not only do as well without it, but found themſelves much better in health, and well ſatisfied in mind.</p>
                  <p>Several phyſicians of eminence have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared themſelves in favour of this ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;

amongſt others, the celebrated doctor Buchan, in his Domeſtic Medicine, or Family Phyſician, a work ſo well e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteemed as to have been, within theſe two years, twice reprinted in this city. At page 71, of the Engliſh edition, he ſays, <q>Many imagine that hard labour could not be ſupported without drinking ſtrong liquors. This, tho' a common, is a very erroneous notion. Men who never taſted ſtrong liquors are not only able to endure more fatigue, but alſo live much longer than thoſe who uſe them daily<note n="*" place="bottom">The few of theſe, who notwithſtanding their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, may have attained to a conſiderable age, it is moſt reaſonable to ſuppoſe, would have lived much longer, had they been temperate.</note>. But ſuppoſe ſtrong liquors did enable a man to do more work, they muſt nevertheleſs waſte the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of life, and of courſe occaſion pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mature old age. They keep up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant fever, which waſtes the ſpirits, heats and inflames the blood, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſes the body to numberleſs diſeaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>At page the ſame, the author tells us, <q>That all intoxicating liquors may be conſidered as poiſons. However diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſed,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013145_0093_0F8EC20277A5CDC8"/>
that is their real character, and ſooner or later they will have their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</q> It is a prevailing opinion in ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of drinking ſpirituous liquors at har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt, and other hard labour, that it gives relief by throwing out the ſweat. Now, moderate quantities of any ſmall liquor, even water itſelf, if not drank too cold, and particularly if ſweetned with molaſſes, and a little ſour'd with ſome proper acid, would certainly anſwer the purpoſe, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the bad effects which attend the uſe of ſpirits.</p>
                  <p>It is well known that a pint of good mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſes will, in diſtillation, afford rather more than a pint of good proof rum; therefore muſt contain as much, if not more real ſtrength than the ſame quantity of rum, without any of its noxious qualities; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing then in the ſtate the Almighty firſt formed it, the fiery property ſo clothed and united with the earthy and balſamick parts, as to cauſe it to be quite friendly to our nature, and not liable to intoxicate; as the ſpirit alone will, when ſeparated by diſtillation from the other parts.</p>
                  <p>Small beer or water mixed with ſome of our home-made wines; or, as before ſaid, water mixed with a due quantity of molaſſes, made agreeably acid, to ſuch as chuſe it, by mixing it with a due propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of cyder, or ſome other acid liquor, or even good vinegar<note n="*" place="bottom">
                        <p>We find by hiſtory, that the Roman ſoldiers in their long marches, often thro' parching deſerts, loaded with heavy armour, uſed vinegar and water as the moſt ſuitable refreſhment, they carried with them two veſſels, either of tin or leather, the one filled with water, the other with vinegar. It alſo appears from ſcripture, in the caſe of Ruth, when in the harveſt field of Boaz, that it was cuſtomary to make uſe of vinegar, as a ſuitable refreſhment in that la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. Ruth, chap. ii.</p>
                        <p>I was informed by a perſon who reſided ſome time with the Indians, that they made a drink with parched corn, which was very agreeable and refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The corn, after being parched, is pounded and ſifted, the mealy part mixed in water, with mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſſes or ſugar, to this ſome proper acid might be added, which would make it yet more agreeable and wholſome.</p>
                     </note>; milk and water, or even water itſelf, if uſed with caution, will anſwer all the purpoſes of common drink for labouring people.</p>
                  <p>Amongſt the ſeveral prejudices in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of the miſtaken uſe of ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, there is none gives it a greater ſanction or ſupport, than the prevailing opinion, even with perſons of reputation, that what they term a moderate quantity of rum mixed with water, is the beſt and ſafeſt liquor that can be drank; hence confirming it, that ſpirit in one form
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013145_0094_0F8EC2032A0464B8"/>
or other is neceſſary. To ſuch who have not been accuſtomed, and think they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not habituate themſelves to drink water, there may appear to be ſome kind of plea in this argument, eſpecially to travellers, who often meet with beer, cyder, or other fermented liquors that are dead, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

But I believe if thoſe perſons ſuffered the weight of the ſubject, and the conſequence of the encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they thereby give to the uſe of theſe deſtructive ſpirits, to take proper place with them, it might ſuggeſt the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, if not neceſſity, of introducing a more ſalutary practice to themſelves and fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies. That pure fluid (water) which the benevolent father of the family of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind points out for general uſe, is ſo ana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logous to the human frame, that except in a very few caſes, people might with ſafety gradually uſe themſelves to it: And as to ſuch well diſpoſed people who ſtill retain a favourable opinion for the uſe of ſpirit mixed with water, ought they not, even from love to mankind, to endeavour to refrain from, and example others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt it, (on account of the prodigious havock made by the uſe of ſpirits) agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the example ſet us by the Apoſtle

Paul, Cor. viii. 13. <hi>If meat make my bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to offend, I will eat no fleſh while the world ſtandeth, leſt I make my brother to of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend;</hi> how much more then ought they to refrain from that which may tend to eſtabliſh mankind in a practice ſo general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtructive; more eſpecially when they conſider the danger themſelves are in, of encreaſing the quantity of ſpirit with their water; as it has been obſerved, that the uſe of this mixture is particularly apt, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt imperceptibly, to gain upon thoſe who uſe it; ſo that many otherwiſe good and judicious people, have, unwarily to themſelves and others, fallen with the common herd, a ſacrifice to this mighty devourer. And where water is met with, as is ſometimes the caſe, which is ſcarce fit to drink; its vain to think to remove the noxious qualities by mixing it with ſpirit; for tho' bad water may be made more palatable by mixing ſpirit with it, yet all the bad qualities of the water will remain, to which will only be ſuperadd<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the bad qualities of the ſpirit. There are many ways propoſed by which water may be helped without any ſuch additions, as by filtration, thro' porous ſtones, or thro' an earthen veſſel, in the bottom of which there is a quantity of ſand, which retains the noxious mixture. Hard water
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013145_0095_0F8EC204184AE328"/>
may be made ſoft by boiling, or by being expoſed to the ſun and air. Some propoſe mixing water, which is impure, with loam; this being well ſtirred and left to ſettle, the noxious parts will ſubſide with the loam, and the water may be drawn off clear and fit for uſe.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Cheyne in his treatiſe before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned, obſerves, That without all perad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venture, water is the primitive original beverage; as it is the only ſimple fluid fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for diluting, moiſtening and cooling— the ends of drink, appointed by nature, and happy had it been for the race of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, if other mixed and artificial liquors had never been invented. <q>It has been an agreeable appearance to me, ſays this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, to obſerve with what freſhneſs and vigour thoſe who, tho' eating freely of fleſh meat, yet drank nothing but this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lement, have lived in health, indolence, and chearfulneſs to a great age. Water alone is ſufficient and effectual for all the purpoſes of human want in drink. Strong liquors were never deſigned for common uſe. They were formerly kept in England, as other medicines are, in apothercaries ſhops.</q> Speaking of the effects of wine (a liquor in general much leſs hurtful than diſtilled ſpirits) which he ſays to have been ſo much in uſe at the time he wrote,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013145_0095_0F8EC204184AE328"/>
that the better ſort of people ſcarcely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted their food with any other liquor, he remarks, <q>That as natural cauſes will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways produce their proper effects, their blood was inflamed into gout, ſtone, and rheumatiſm, raging fevers, pleuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies, &amp;c. Water is the only diſſolvent or menſtruum, and the moſt certain di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luter of all bodies proper for food.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doctor Short, in his diſcourſe of the inward uſe of water, ſpeaks much in its commendation. He ſays, we can draw a very convincing argument of the excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of water, from the longevity and healthfulneſs of thoſe who at firſt had no better liquor, and the health and ſtrength of body and ſerenity of mind of thoſe who at this day have no other common liquor to drink. Of this the common people amongſt the Highlands of Scotland, are a ſufficient inſtance, amongſt whom it is no rarity to find perſons of eighty, ninety, yea an hundred years of age, as healthy, ſtrong, and nimble, as wine or ale bibbers are at thirty-ſix or forty<note n="*" place="bottom">I was informed by a perſon of credit, from his own obſervations in Scotland, of the ſtrength and hardineſs of the common people there; and of their ability to bear cold and fatigue; tho' the cold is great in winter, and their ſupport in ſome parts principally, if not wholly when abroad, confined to oatmeal and water; he has ſeen a ſhepherd laid down to reſt or ſleep on the mountain, without any ſhelter, wrapt up in his plaid in cold ſnowy weather, ſuch as would have froze moſt other people.</note>. The excellency of

water, the doctor ſays, may be argued from the great ſucceſs people, otherwiſe deſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable, have attained over other nations, while they remained content with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of nature for drink. Of this the Perſian, Grecian, and Roman monarchies are inſtances. This was alſo the caſe of our anceſtors, the Saxons, Danes, and Normans, whilſt their manners remained ſimple, and their food and drink ſuch as nature had provided, they encreaſed to ſuch a degree, that their country not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to contain them, they were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſend out ſwarms of people to ſeek for ſettlements in the more ſouthern parts of the world; theſe gradually ſettled them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in the different parts of the Roman empire: But ſince thoſe Northern King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms have forſaken the wholſome cuſtoms of their forefathers, and habituated them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the uſe of ſtrong liquors, they are ſo enfeebled, and their numbers have ſo much decreaſed, that many parts of
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:013145_0096_0F8EC204B585F338"/>
their own country now remain unculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated. The rulers eaſy under the pecuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary advantages which ariſe, themſelves en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſlaved to the practice of drinking to exceſs, look without concern on this enormous ruin of multitudes of their fellow men. Thus it is in Ruſſia, where a vaſt revenue is raiſed from diſtilled ſpirituous liquors, and a multitude of people proportionably large, are deſtroyed thereby. Again ſays the doctor, <q>There is a ridiculous maxim uſed by drinkers, that water makes but thin blood, not fit for buſineſs—I ſay it is water only that can endue its drinkers with the ſtrongeſt bodies and moſt robuſt conſtitutions, where exerciſe or labour is joined with it, ſince it beſt aſſiſts the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach and lungs to reduce the aliments into the ſmalleſt particles, that they may better paſs the ſtrainers of the body, which ſeparates the nutritious parts of the blood to be applyed to the ſides of the veſſels, and exerciſe invigorates the fibres and muſcles; whereas the rapid motion of the blood excited by drinking ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, can not fail of being prejudicial to the body, it will cauſe the watery parts to diſſipate and the remaining grow thick and tough, and the event be obſtructions, inflammations, impoſthumations, &amp;c.— and tho' ſtrong liquors afford a greater
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:013145_0097_0F8EC20574D252D8"/>
flow of ſpirit for a ſhort time, yet this is always followed with as much low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit; ſo that to gain a neceſſary ſtock of ſpirits, the perſon is obliged to repeat the ſame force, till he learns a cuſtom of drinking drams. In this we are confirmed, if we conſider the great ſtrength and hardineſs of poor ruſticks in many parts of the world, whoſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions is moſtly vegetable food, and their drink water.</q> The doctor adds, <q>That it often happens that perſons of tender, weakly, crazy conſtitutions, by refrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtrong liquors and accuſtoming them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to drink water, make ſhift to ſpin out many years.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Doctor Cadogan, in his treatiſe on the gout, lately printed in this city, tells us, <q>That water is the only liquor nature knows of, or has provided for all ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mals, and whatſoever nature gives we muſt depend upon it, is beſt and ſafeſt for us; accordingly we ſee that when we have committed any exceſs or miſtake of any kind, and ſuffer for it, 'tis water that relieves. Hence the chief good of bath, ſpa, and many other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicinal waters, eſpecially to hard drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. It is that element that dilutes and carries off crudities and indigeſtions, &amp;c. the mineral virtues they contain may
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:013145_0097_0F8EC20574D252D8"/>
make them tolerable to the ſtomach in their paſſage, but do, as I believe, little more in the body, it is the water that cures. Wine was given us as a cordial.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>Cheyne ſays he has known men of weak and tender conſtitutions, who could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther eat nor digeſt upon drinking wine, who, by drinking at meals common water heated, have recovered their appetites and digeſtion, &amp;c. have thriven and grown plump. Speaking of malt liquors, he gives it as his ſentiment, that a weak ſtomach can as readily, and with leſs pain, digeſt pork and peaſe ſoup, as Yorkſhire or Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tingham ale: he adds, That they are of ſo glutinous a nature as to make excellent bird lime, and when ſimmered ſometime over a gentle fire, make the moſt ſticking, and the beſt plaſter for old ſtrains that can be contrived. Even the ſmall beer that is commonly drank at London, if it be not well boiled, very clear, and of a due age, muſt be hurtful to perſons of weak nerves and ſlow digeſtion.</p>
                  <p>Doctor Buchan tells us, The great quantity of viſcid malt liquor drank by the common people of England, cannot fail to render the blood ſizy and unfit for circulation, from whence proceed obſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and inflammations of the lungs. Thoſe who drink ardent ſpirits or ſtrong
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:013145_0098_0F8EC2065DE46B88"/>
wine, do not run leſs hazard; theſe li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors heat and inflame the blood, and tear the tender veſſels of the lungs in pieces.</p>
                  <p>Doctor Short, page 33, after deſcribing the many diſtempers produced by drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of malt and other fermented liquors, adds, That ſeeing conſtitutions differ, it is not to be expected that ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors ſhould produce all the ſame ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms in one and the ſame perſon, yet that all drinkers have ſeveral of them; and if they come not to that height, its becauſe they afterwards uſe great exerciſe or hard labour, with ſometimes thin diluting li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, which prevent their immediate hurting<note n="*" place="bottom">Doctor Edward Bancroft, in his natural hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of Guiana, which includes the colonies of Suri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, Barbices, &amp;c. writes, That the inhabitants derive no ſmall aſſiſtance from the Indians—ſome of whom reſide on almoſt every plantation.—Theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians however, are debauched by luxury and intem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, and their manners but ill agree with thoſe of the Indians who have preſerved their natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence and ſimplicity. They are encouraged in their propenſity to intemperance by the whites, who freely ſupply them with rum, thereby to attach them more firmly to their ſervice, which conſiderably im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs their health and diminiſhes their numbers.— Speaking of the diſeaſes incident to the country, he ſays, Theſe are as numerous as in other countries, where they have been augmented by cookery, with its ſtimulating, provocative arts, exciting inordinate appetites, by multiplying the variety of diſhes, which blended in the ſtomach, compoſe ſuch an incongru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous medly, that the digeſtive organs cannot poſſibly aſſimilate the pernicious maſs to wholeſome chyle. Nor has intemperate luxury been confined to this ſingle innovation. <hi>Water,</hi> the natural drink of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as of all other animals, is now contaminated by the mixture of pernicious ſpirits, which have poiſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed one of the principal bleſſings of life. From this ſource are derived thoſe tribes of diſeaſes which op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs humanity.</note>.</p>

This is generally of two kinds, very different in their nature and effect, <hi>viz.</hi> The one is a mixture of ſpirituous liquors, as punch, grog, &amp;c. or fermented liquors, as cyder, beer, &amp;c. The other is mild and diluting, ſuch as tea, or coffee, &amp;c. The uſe of ſpirituous or fermented liquors, for the reaſons already given, are hurtful and dangerous; more eſpecially, as the ſorrowful experience of many within knowledge, has taught that there is very great danger of even ſober
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013145_0099_0F8EC2071862DBE0"/>
people who uſe them, with what is termed moderation, becoming habituated and gradually encreaſing their ſtrength and quantity, till it proves the ruin of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and families.</p>
                  <p>This caution can ſcarcely be too often repeated, as it has been ſo frequently the melancholy ſituation of perſons, otherwiſe valuable members of ſociety. But the uſe of mild diluting drinks, ſuch as cof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fee, or the ſeveral ſorts of teas, either of our own produce or thoſe brought from the Indies, may be truly termed innocent and friendly to our natures, and very proper to promote a good perſpiration and recruit our ſpirits when diſſipated thro' application or labour. And as the uſe of theſe innocent dilutors have not eſcaped cenſure, more eſpecially from perſons who are attached to the uſe of ſpirituous or fermented liquors; it may be agreeable to the reader, to hear the ſentiments of doctor Cheyne on the ſubject. And here it may be well to remark that theſe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations were addreſſed to the people of England, where the heat not being ſo great as in theſe parts, thoſe reſtorative dilutent drinks are not ſo frequently ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. A diſh or two of coffee, the doctor ſays, with a little milk to ſoften it, in raw or damp weather, or on a wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teriſh
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013145_0099_0F8EC2071862DBE0"/>
and flegmatick ſtomach, is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly innocent but a preſent relief.—Tea <note n="*" place="bottom">The middling priced is eſteemed the moſt wholſome.</note>, particularly Green, when light and ſoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a little milk, if neither too ſtrong nor too hot, he looks upon as a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per dilutent, very ſuitable to cleanſe the alimentary paſſages, and waſh of the ſcorbutick and urinous ſalts: He alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends tea made of ſliced orange or lemon, as one of the beſt promoters of digeſtion after a full meal, or when peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are dry between meals. As to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons of weak and tender nerves, who find that upon uſing of theſe drinks with free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, or in too great quantity, they fall into lowneſs and trembling; ſuch ought to uſe them with moderation and caution.</p>
                  <p>Again we know, ſays he, that warm wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter will moſt of any thing, promote and aſſiſt digeſtion in perſons of weak ſtomachs and tender nerves; by this alone I have ſeen ſeveral ſuch perſons recover to a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle, when cold mineral waters, bitters, cordials, and drams have done rather harm than good.—Tea is but an infuſion in water of an innocent plant: Innocent, he ſays, becauſe we find by its taſte, it has
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013145_0100_0F8EC20B743693C0"/>
neither poiſonous, deleterious, nor acri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious qualities; and we are certain from its uſe, in the countries it come from <note n="†" place="bottom">Chambers in his dictionary of arts and ſciences, tells us, That the Chineſe are always taking tea, eſpecially at meals; it is the chiefeſt treat wherewith they regale their friends. The moſt moderate take it at leaſt thrice a day.</note>, (which are larger than Europe) that they receive no damage from it; but on the contrary, that it promotes both digeſtion and perſpiration. The arguments for its relaxing the coats of the ſtomach and bow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>els by its heat, are of no force; for unleſs it be drank much hotter than the blood, it can do no hurt that way.—However, I would adviſe thoſe who drink tea plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, not to drink it much hotter than blood warm, whereby they will receive all its benefits, and be ſecure againſt all the harm it can poſſibly do.</p>
                  <p>Doctor Engelbertus Kaempfer, phyſician of the Dutch embaſſy to the emperor of Japan, in his account of that country, giving a particular account of the growth, preparation, and uſe of tea; ſays, It is ſo common in Japan, that travellers drink ſcarce any thing elſe upon the road.—The freſh gathered leaves are dried or roaſted
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:013145_0100_0F8EC20B743693C0"/>
over the fire in an iron pan, and when hot, rolled with the palm of the hand on a matt, till they become curled. They have public roaſting houſes built for this very purpoſe, and contrived ſo that every body may bring their leaves to be roaſted. The doctor makes no diſtinction between green and bohea; the only difference from his account, ariſes from the different time of gathering. The firſt, gathered whilſt the leaves are tender, has the beſt flavour and is moſt valuable; the ſecond is leſs ſo: the laſt, gathered when the leaves are full grown is the cheapeſt. He gives it as his ſentiments, from his obſervations of the effect of tea, that when properly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared and of a due age, it gently refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es the animal ſpirits, and wonderfully chears and comforts the mind; it opens obſtructions, cleanſes the blood, and more particularly removes that tartarous matter which is the efficient cauſe of gravelly and gouty diſtempers. This he ſays it does ſo effectually, that he never met with any who was troubled either with the gout or ſtone, amongſt the tea-drinkers of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pan. He adds that he is wholly of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that the uſe of teas would be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the ſame ſucceſs in the like caſes, even in Europe, were it not for an here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary diſpoſition, for either of theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempers derived to ſome perſons from their
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:013145_0101_0F8EC20CF67BF7B0"/>
anceſtors; and which is frequently che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed and fomented by a too plentiful uſe of wine, beer, ſtrong liquors and fleſh meats. It appears the uſe of tea meets with oppoſition in the Eaſt countries, as well as amongſt ourſelves, from thoſe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons whoſe practice contradicts the uſe of theſe kinds of innocent diluting drinks: for the doctor remarks, That in Japan the uſe of tea is very much cried down by thoſe perſons who are lovers of ſakki beer, which is there brewed from rice.</p>
                  <p>All the good qualities aſcribed by the above mentioned phyſicians, to foreign tea, may be as truly applied to teas made of our own country produce, ſuch as ſage, balm, burnet, ſaſſafraſs, &amp;c. &amp;c. theſe I am perſuaded would anſwer all, if not more and better purpoſes than the foreign teas. But I ſpare to ſay much on this head at preſent, leſt by diſcouraging the uſe of any mild diluting drink, (eſpecially one in ſuch general uſe, and which ſimply conſidered as a diluent, muſt be acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged a good ſubſtitute,) any ſtrength ſhould be given to the uſe of ſpirituous or fermented liquors in its ſtead.</p>
                  <p>We may alſo make a very good refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drink of the nature of coffee; from roaſted wheat, barley, rye, or cheſnuts, full as agreeable, wholeſome, and nouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, if not much more ſo than coffee it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</p>

To this I ſhall reply with the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable author firſt mentioned. Let ſuch lawmakers, governors, and rulers, who retain any love and pity for their fellow men; let <hi>theſe</hi> be earneſtly requeſted ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly, and ſolemnly to conſider, whether it is not <hi>their</hi> indiſpenſable duty to uſe their utmoſt endeavours, that a ſtop may be put to this dreadful calamity; let not the apprehenſion of loſs or any preſent incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniency, deter any from doing their duty in this reſpect, becauſe there cannot any inconveniencies poſſibly ariſe from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs of this grievance, which deſerves to be named with thoſe evils which will be the undoubted conſequence of its conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance. The reaſons that have hitherto prevailed to the countenancing of this moſt deſtructive practice, ought ſurely to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected with ſcorn and indignation, when the welfare of ſuch vaſt numbers are ſo deeply concerned. What multitudes of lives would thereby be ſaved, and what innumerable outrages, as theft, murder, &amp;c. prevented: To rectify which, were an apparently vain and fruitleſs attempt, while drunkenneſs is made the cheapeſt of all vices. A vice which can no otherwiſe be
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:013145_0102_0F8EC20DA874CBD8"/>
effectually prevented from raging with its preſent exceſſive enormity, and ſpreading devaſtation all around, but by laying ſuch high taxes upon diſtilled ſpirituous liquors, as well thoſe made amongſt us, as thoſe imported from abroad, as will make the drinking it ſufficiently expenſive to put it out of the reach of ſo great a number of inſatiable drinkers, to uſe it; at leaſt in its preſent degree of ſtrength.—<q>Alas, ſays he, how aſtoniſhing a calamity is this, depraving the morals and ſhorten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and deſtroying the lives of ſuch multitudes, probably no leſs than a mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion yearly all over the world—were but one fourth of this number yearly deſtroyed by raging peſtilence, with what earneſt ſupplications would man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind deprecate ſo terrifying and ſore an affliction.</q> How ſevere a judgment is it, when God leaves men to be their own ſcourgers? with how unrelenting and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merciful a heart do they execute the moſt ſevere puniſhment upon themſelves!—Particulars who view this matter in its full importance, will query, What can an individual or private man do in the caſe? To theſe it may be obſerved, That as po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular amendments conſiſt wholly of the actions of individuals, every one who is ſincere in his deſires, that a remedy may be applied to this mighty evil, muſt, to
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:013145_0102_0F8EC20DA874CBD8"/>
the utmoſt of his power, diſcourage the encreaſe of ſpirituous liquors either by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation, diſtillation, or otherwiſe, and not deceive themſelves, or rather ſuffer the God of this world to deceive them by means of the ſpecious pretences common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly advanced; ſuch as, That other people will be active in augmenting the quantity if they do not; or, That however people may abuſe themſelves thro' exceſs, yet what is deemed a moderate quantity, may lawfully be uſed; but it may eaſily be ſhewn, that theſe and other arguments commonly advanced, are vain, tho' plau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible pretences; that the true motive is the deſire of gain: That every new importer and diſtiller, (and oh that the vender alſo may bring his ſituation to the true ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance) becomes a party to the evil; gives freſh ſtrength to the practice, by holding out an additional quantity, and of courſe making it in ſome degree cheaper, at leaſt eaſier for their fellow men to come at, to the deſtruction of their brethren, children of the ſame father, and who as chriſtians they profeſs to love as themſelves.</p>
                  <p>And as for ſuch who, tho' convinced of the impropriety of the practice, yet for fear of not having their labour performed, or for other reaſons, cannot prevail upon themſelves to refrain giving it to their ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants and labourers, let theſe at leaſt ſo
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:013145_0103_0F8EC20E94403C10"/>
weaken and qualify it, as to prevent its immediate deſtructive effects.</p>
                  <p>A very eminent phyſician has given the following direction for the benefit of thoſe who have not wiſdom enough left at once to abandon the odious and pernicious practice of drinking diſtilled ſpirituous li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quors, <hi>viz.</hi> By degrees to mix water with the ſpirit; to leſſen the quantity every day, and keep to the ſame quantity of water, till in about the courſe of a week, nothing of the dram kind be uſed along with the water. By this means the perſon will ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer no inconveniency, but reap great be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit upon leaving off drams or ſpirits, as has been tried by many. If any gnawing be left in the ſtomach upon quite leaving it off, a little warm broth, weak tea, or any thing of that kind, will be of ſervice. The appetite always increaſes in a few days after leaving off drams, unleſs by the too long continuance of them, the tone of the ſtomach is deſtroyed. And when the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach is thus affected, a cup of carduus, camomile tea, wormwood or centaury every morning faſting and every evening, will be found a good remedy.</p>

                     <pb n="47" facs="unknown:013145_0103_0F8EC20E94403C10"/>Some GENERAL MAXIMS, moſtly drawn from the foregoing, which as they cannot be too obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly held up in the view of the young and inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate, its hoped the obſervant reader will excuſe the repetition.</p>
                  <p>THE great rule of diet is to ſtudy ſimplicity: Nature delights in the moſt plain and ſimple food; and every animal, except man, follows her dictates.</p>
                  <p>Nothing conduces more to health and long life, than abſtinence and plain food, with due labour.</p>
                  <p>Water alone is ſufficient and effectual for all the purpoſes of human want in drink: It is the univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal diſſolvent nature has provided, and the moſt cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain diluter of all bodies proper for food; quickens the appetite and ſtrengthens digeſtion moſt. Doctor Cheyne and doctor Cadogan.</p>
                  <p>Strong and ſpirituous liquors were never deſigned for common uſe: They were formerly kept in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, as other medicines are, in apothecaries ſhops: If freely indulged, they become a certain tho' ſlow poiſon. Cheyne.</p>
                  <p>All intoxicating liquors may be conſidered as poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; however diſguiſed, that is their real charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and ſooner or later they will have their effect. Doctor Buchan.</p>
                  <p>Every act of intoxication puts nature to the expence of a fever, in order to diſcharge the poiſonous draught; when this is repeated almoſt every day, it is eaſy to foreſee the conſequence.</p>
                  <p>Fevers occaſioned by drinking, do not always go off in a day, they frequently end in an inflammation of the breaſt, liver, or brain, and produce fatal effects.</p>
                  <p>There is no danger in leaving off drinking ſtrong liquors at once, the plea for continuing them being falſe and groundleſs. Cheyne.</p>
                  <p>Strong liquors do not prevent the miſchiefs of a
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:013145_0104_0F8EC20F3ADE09B0"/>
ſurfeit, nor carry it off ſo ſefely as water, tho' they ſeem to give preſent relief. Cheyne.</p>
                  <p>Many imagine that hard labour could not be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported without drinking ſtrong liquors. This tho' a common, is a very erroneous opinion: Men who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver taſted ſtrong liquors, are not only able to endure more fatigue, but alſo live much longer than thoſe who uſe them daily. Buchan.</p>
                  <p>Every thing that has paſt the fire, ſo that it has had due time to divide and penetrate its parts, as in diſtillation, as far as it poſſibly can, retains a cauſtic corroſive and burning quality ever afterwards.</p>
                  <p>In the continued diſtillation of ſpirits, the action of fire is ſo ſtrong as to reduce them to liquid fire at laſt; which will of themſelves evaporate in viſible flames and fumes, Cheyne.</p>
                  <p>The great quantity of viſcid malt liquor drank by the common people of England, cannot fail to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the blood ſizy and unfit for circulation, from whence proceed obſtructions and inflammations of the lungs, &amp;c. Buchan.</p>
                  <p>Malt liquors (excepting clear ſmall beer of due age) are extreamly hurtful to tender and ſtudious perſons. Cheyne.</p>
                  <p>There are few great ale drinkers who are not phthiſical, nor is that to be wondered at, conſidering the glutinous and almoſt indigeſtible nature of ſtrong ale. Buchan.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe who drink ardent ſpirits or ſtrong wines do not run leſs hazard; theſe liquors heat and inflame the blood, and tear the tender veſſels of the lungs in pieces. Buchan.</p>
                  <p>Doctor Cadogan in his late treatiſe on the gout, ſays, He cannot allow him to be ſtrictly temperate, who drinks any wine or ſtrong liquors at all, unleſs it be medicinally.</p>

                  <head>THOUGHTS UPON SLAVERY.</head>
                  <p n="1">I. BY <hi>ſlavery</hi> I mean domeſtic ſlavery, or that of a ſervant to a maſter. A late ingenious writer well obſerves, "The variety of forms in which ſlavery appears, makes it almoſt impoſſible to convey a juſt notion of it, by way of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finition. There are however certain pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perties which have accompanied ſlavery in moſt places, whereby it is eaſily diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from that mild domeſtic <hi>ſervice</hi> which obtains in our own country<note n="*" place="bottom">See Mr. <hi>Hargrave's</hi> plea for <hi>Somerſet</hi> the negro.</note>."</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Slavery</hi> imports an obligation of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual ſervice, an obligation which only
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013145_0106_0F8EC210B05561F0"/>
the conſent of the maſter can diſſolve. Neither in ſome countries can the maſter himſelf diſſolve it, without the conſent of judges appointed by law. It generally gives the maſter an arbitrary power of any correction not affecting life or limb.— Sometimes even theſe are expoſed to his will: or protected only by a ſine, or ſome ſlight puniſhment, too inſiconderable to reſtrain a maſter of an harſh temper. It creates an incapacity of acquiring any thing, except for the maſter's benefit. It allows the maſter to alienate the ſlave, in the ſame manner as his cows and horſes. Laſtly, it deſcends in its full extent from parent to child, even to the lateſt gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The beginning of this may be dated from the remoteſt period, of which we have an account in hiſtory. It commenced in the barbarous ſtate of ſociety, and in proceſs of time ſpread into all nations. It prevailed particularly among the <hi>Jews,</hi> the <hi>Greeks,</hi> the <hi>Romans,</hi> and the antient <hi>Germans:</hi> And was tranſmitted by them to the various kingdoms and ſtates, which aroſe out of the ruins of the <hi>Roman</hi> em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire. But after chriſtianity prevailed, it gradually fell into decline in almoſt all parts of <hi>Europe.</hi> This great change began in <hi>Spain,</hi> about the end of the eighth cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury:
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013145_0106_0F8EC210B05561F0"/>
And was become general in moſt other kingdoms of <hi>Europe,</hi> before the mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle of the fourteenth.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. From this time ſlavery was nearly extinct, till the commencement of the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth century, when the diſcovery of <hi>America,</hi> and of the weſtern and eaſtern coaſts of <hi>Africa,</hi> gave occaſion to the revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of it. It took its riſe from the <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe,</hi> who to ſupply the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with men, to cultivate their new poſſeſſions in <hi>America,</hi> procured negroes from <hi>Africa,</hi> whom they ſold for ſlaves to the <hi>American</hi> Spaniards. This began in the year 1508, when they imported the firſt negroes into <hi>Hiſpaniola.</hi> In 1540 <hi>Charles</hi> the fifth, then king of <hi>Spain,</hi> determined to put an end to <hi>negro-ſlavery:</hi> Giving poſitive orders, That all the negro ſlaves in the Spaniſh dominions ſhould be ſet free. And this was accordingly done by <hi>Lagaſca,</hi> whom he ſent and impowered to free them all, on condition of continuing to labour for their maſters. But ſoon after <hi>Lagaſca</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to <hi>Spain,</hi> ſlavery returned and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed as before. Afterwards other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as they acquired poſſeſſions in <hi>America,</hi> followed the examples of the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> and ſlavery has now taken deep root in moſt of our <hi>American</hi> colonies.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <pb n="6" facs="unknown:013145_0107_0F8EC21160BEEF40"/>II. Such is the nature of ſlavery: Such the beginning of negro-ſlavery in <hi>America.</hi> But ſome may deſire to know, what kind of country it is, from which the negroes are brought? What ſort of men, of what temper and behaviour are they in their own country? And in what manner they are generally procured, carried to, and treated in <hi>America?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. And firſt, What kind of country is that from whence they are brought? Is it ſo remarkably horrid, dreary and barren, that it is a kindneſs to deliver them out of it? I believe many have apprehended ſo: But it is an entire miſtake, if we may give credit to thoſe who have lived many years therein, and could have no motive to miſrepreſent it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. That part of <hi>Africa</hi> whence the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes are brought, commonly known by the name of <hi>Guinea,</hi> extends along the coaſt, in the whole, between three and four thouſand miles. From the river <hi>Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negal,</hi> (ſeventeen degrees north of the line) to Cape <hi>Sierra Leona,</hi> it contains ſeven hundred miles. Thence it runs eaſtward about fifteen hundred miles, including the <hi>Grain-Coaſt,</hi> the <hi>Ivory-Coaſt,</hi> the <hi>Gold-Coaſt,</hi> and the <hi>Slave-Coaſt,</hi> with the large king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of <hi>Benin.</hi> From thence it runs ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, about twelve hundred miles, and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013145_0107_0F8EC21160BEEF40"/>
contains the kingdoms of <hi>Congo</hi> and <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gola.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Concerning the firſt, the <hi>Senegal-Coaſt,</hi> Monſ. <hi>Brue,</hi> who lived there ſixteen years, after deſcribing its fruitfulneſs near the ſea, ſays, "The farther you go from the ſea, the more fruitful and well-im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved is the country, abounding in pulſe, Indian corn, and various fruits. Here are vaſt meadows, which feed large herds of great and ſmall cattle. And the villages which lie thick, ſhew the country is well peopled." And again: "I was ſurprized, to ſee the land ſo well cultivated; ſcarce a ſpot lay un-improved: The low lands divided by ſmall canals, were all ſowed with rice: The higher grounds were plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with Indian corn, and peas of different ſorts. Their beef is excellent; poultry plenty and very cheap, as are all the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries of life."</p>
                  <p n="4">4. As to the <hi>Grain</hi> and <hi>Ivory Coaſt,</hi> we learn from eye witneſſes, that the ſoil is in general fertile, producing abundance of rice and roots. Indigo and cotton thrive without cultivation.—Fiſh is in great plenty; the flocks and herds are numerous, and the trees loaded with fruit.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The <hi>Gold-Coaſt</hi> and <hi>Slave-Coaſt,</hi> all who have ſeen it agree, is exceeding fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and pleaſant, producing vaſt quantities
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013145_0108_0F8EC21632E42320"/>
of rice and other grain, plenty of fruit and roots, palm-wine, and oil, and fiſh in great abundance, with much tame and wild cattle. The very ſame account is given us of the ſoil and produce of the kingdoms of <hi>Benin, Congo</hi> and <hi>Angola.</hi>— From all which it appears, That <hi>Guinea</hi> in general, far from being an horrid, dreary, barren country, is one of the moſt fruitful, as well as the moſt pleaſant countries in the known world. It is ſaid indeed to be unhealthy. And ſo it is to ſtrangers, but perfectly healthy to the native inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. Such is the country from which the negroes are brought. We come next to enquire, What ſort of men they are, of what temper and behaviour, not in our plantations, but in their native country. And here likewiſe the ſureſt way is to take our account from eye and ear witneſſes. Now thoſe who have lived in the <hi>Senegal</hi> country obſerve, it is inhabited by three nations, the <hi>Jalofs, Fulis,</hi> and <hi>Mandingos.</hi> The king of the <hi>Jalofs</hi> has under him ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral miniſters, who aſſiſt in the exerciſe of juſtice. The chief juſtice goes in cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuit through all his dominions, to hear complaints and determine controverſies. And the viceroy goes with him, to inſpect the behaviour of the <hi>Alkadi,</hi> or Governor
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013145_0108_0F8EC21632E42320"/>
of each village. The <hi>Fulis</hi> are a numerous people; the ſoil of their country repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as rich, affording large harveſts, and the people laborious and good farmers: Of ſome of theſe <hi>Fuli</hi> blacks who dwelt on the river <hi>Gambia, William Moor</hi> the <hi>Engliſh</hi> factor gives a very favourable account.— He ſays, they are governed by their chief men, who rule with much moderation. Few of them will drink any thing ſtronger than water, being ſtrict <hi>Mahometans.</hi> The government is eaſy, becauſe the people are of a good and quiet diſpoſition; and ſo well inſtructed in what is right, that a man who wrongs another is the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all.—They deſire no more land than they uſe, which they cultivate with great care and induſtry: If any of them are known to be made ſlaves by the white men they all join to redeem them. They not only ſupport all that are old, or blind, or lame among themſelves; but have frequently ſupplied the neceſſities of the <hi>Mandingos,</hi> when they were diſtreſt by famine.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The <hi>Mandingos,</hi> ſays Monſ. <hi>Brue,</hi> are rigid <hi>Mahometans,</hi> drinking neither wine nor brandy. They are induſtrious and laborious, keeping their ground well cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated, and breeding a good ſtock of cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle. Every town has a governor, and he
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013145_0109_0F8EC2174DB523D8"/>
appoints the labour of the people. The men work the ground deſigned for corn; the women and girls, the rice-ground.— He afterwards divides the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> rice among them: And decides all quarrels if any ariſe. All the Mahometan negroes conſtantly go to public prayers thrice a day: there being a prieſt in every village, who regularly calls them together: Some authors ſay, it is ſurprizing to ſee the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and reverence which they obſerve during their worſhip.—Theſe three nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons practiſe ſeveral trades; they have ſmiths, ſadlers, potters and weavers. And they are very ingenious at their ſeveral occupations.—Their ſmiths not only make all the inſtruments of iron, which they have occaſion to uſe, but likewiſe work many things neatly in gold and ſilver. It is chiefly the women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren who weave fine cotton cloth, which they dye blue and black.</p>
                  <p n="8">8. It was of theſe parts of <hi>Guinea,</hi> that Monſ. <hi>Adanſon,</hi> correſpondent of the royal academy of ſciences at <hi>Paris</hi> from 1749 to 1753, gives the following account, both as to the country and people. "Which way ſoever I turned my eyes, I beheld a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect image of pure nature: An agreeable ſolitude, bounded on every ſide by a charming landſcape; the rural ſituation
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013145_0109_0F8EC2174DB523D8"/>
of cottages, in the midſt of trees; the eaſe and quietneſs of the negroes, reclined un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſhade of the ſpreading foliage, with the ſimplicity of their dreſs and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners: The whole revived in my mind the idea of our firſt parents, and I ſeemed to contemplate the world in its primitive ſtate. They are generally-ſpeaking, very good-natured, ſociable and obliging. I was not a little pleaſed with my very firſt reception, and it fully convinced me, that there ought to be a conſiderable abate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made, in the accounts we have of the ſavage character of the <hi>Africans.</hi>" He adds, "It is amazing that an illiterate people ſhould reaſon ſo pertinently con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the heavenly bodies. There is no doubt, but that with proper inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, they would become excellent aſtro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomers."</p>
                  <p n="9">9. The inhabitants of the <hi>Grain</hi> and <hi>Ivory-Coaſt</hi> are repreſented by thoſe that deal with them, as ſenſible, courteous, and the faireſt traders on the coaſts of <hi>Guinea.</hi> They rarely drink to exceſs: If any do, they are ſeverely puniſhed by the king's order. They are ſeldom troubled with war: If a difference happen between two nations, they commony end the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute amicably.</p>
                  <p>The inhabitants of the <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Slave-Coaſt</hi> likewiſe, when they are not artfully
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013145_0110_0F8EC2178B277030"/>
incenſed againſt each other, live in great union and friendſhip, being generally well-tempered, civil, tractable, and ready to help any that need it. In particular, the natives of the kingdom of <hi>Whidah</hi> are civil, kind, and obliging to ſtrangers.—And they are the moſt gentleman-like of all the negroes, abounding in good man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners towards each other. The inferiors pay great reſpect to their ſuperiors:— So wives to their huſbands, children to their parents. And they are remarkably induſtrious: All are conſtantly employ'd; the men in agriculture, the women in ſpinning and weaving cotton.</p>
                  <p n="10">10. The <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Slave Coaſts</hi> are divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into ſeveral diſtricts, ſome governed by kings, others by the principal men, who take care each of their own town or vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lage, and prevent or appeaſe tumults.— They puniſh murder and adultery ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely; very frequently with death.—Theft and robbery are puniſhed by a fine proportionable to the goods that were taken. —All the natives of this coaſt, though heathens, believe there is one GOD, the author of them and all things. They appear likewiſe to have a confuſed appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of a future ſtate. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly every town and village has a place of public worſhip.— It is remarkable that
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013145_0110_0F8EC2178B277030"/>
they have no beggars among them: Such is the care of the chief men, in every city and village, to provide ſome eaſy labour, even for the old and weak. Some are employ'd in blowing the ſmiths bellows; others in preſſing palm-oil; others in grinding of colours. If they are too weak even for this, they ſell proviſions in the market.</p>
                  <p n="11">11. The accounts we have of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the kingdom of <hi>Benin</hi> is, that they are a reaſonable and good-natured people, ſincere and inoffenſive, and do no injuſtice either to one another or to ſtrangers.— They are civil and courteous: If you make them a preſent, they endeavour to repay it double. And if they are truſted, till the ſhip returns next year, they are ſure honeſtly to pay the whole debt.—Theft is puniſhed among them, altho' not with the ſame ſeverity as murder. If a man and woman of any quality, are taken in adultery, they are certain to be put to death, and their bodies thrown on a dunghill, and left a prey to wild beaſts. They are punctually juſt and honeſt in their dealings; and are alſo very charitable: The king and the great lords taking care to employ all that are capable of any work. And thoſe that are utterly helpleſs they keep for GOD's ſake; ſo that here alſo are
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:013145_0111_0F8EC21827FF1ED8"/>
no beggars. The inhabitants of <hi>Congo</hi> and <hi>Angola</hi> are generally a quiet people. They diſcover a good underſtanding, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have in a friendly manner to ſtrangers, being of a mild temper and an affable car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage.—Upon the whole therefore the negroes who inhabit the coaſt of <hi>Africa,</hi> from the river <hi>Senegal</hi> to the ſouthern bounds of <hi>Angola,</hi> are ſo far from being the ſtupid, ſenſeleſs, brutiſh, lazy barba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rians, the fierce, cruel, perfidious ſavages they have been deſcribed, that on the contrary, they are repreſented by them who had no motive to flatter them, as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably ſenſible, conſidering the few advantages they have for improving their underſtanding:—As very induſtrious, perhaps more ſo than any other natives of ſo warm a climate.—As fair, juſt and honeſt in their dealings, unleſs where whitemen have taught them to be otherwiſe:—And as far more mild, friendly and kind to ſtrangers, than any of our forefathers were. Our forefathers! Where ſhall we find at this day, among the fair-faced natives of <hi>Europe,</hi> a nation generally practiſing the juſtice, mercy, and truth, which are related of theſe poor black <hi>Africans?</hi> Suppoſe the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing accounts are true, (which I ſee no rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon on pretence to doubt of) and we may
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013145_0111_0F8EC21827FF1ED8"/>
leave <hi>England</hi> and <hi>France,</hi> to ſeek genuine honeſty in <hi>Benin, Congo,</hi> or <hi>Angola.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">III. We have now ſeen, what kind of country it is, from which the negroes are brought: And what ſort of men (even whitemen being the judges) they were in their own country. Enquire we, Thirdly, In what manner are they generally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, carried to, and treated in <hi>America.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt.</hi> In what manner are they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured? Part of them by fraud. Captains of ſhips from time to time, have invited negroes to come on board, and then car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them away. But far more have been procured by force. The chriſtians land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon their coaſts, ſeized as many as they found, men, women and children, and tranſported them to <hi>America.</hi> It was about 1551, that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> began trading to <hi>Guinea:</hi> At firſt, for gold and elephants teeth, but ſoon after, for men. In 1566, Sir <hi>John Hawkins</hi> ſailed with two ſhips to Cape <hi>Verd,</hi> where he ſent eighty men on ſhore to catch negroes. But the natives flying, they fell farther down, and there ſet the men on ſhore, "to burn their towns and take the inhabitants." But they met with ſuch reſiſtance, that they had ſeven men killed, and took but ten negroes. So they went ſtill farther down,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013145_0112_0F8EC218F6F89608"/>

                        <p>Here it may be well to give a particular ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that tranſaction in the very words in which it is tranſmitted to us by early hiſtorians, as it is a clear proof, that it was ſolely from a deſire of gain that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> firſt undertook to ſeize and bring the unhappy <hi>Africans</hi> from their native country; and is a clear and poſitive refutation of thoſe falſe arguments frequently advanced in vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of the ſlave trade, viz. That the firſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of negro ſlaves by the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> was from mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of compaſſion, with views of ſaving the lives of ſome of thoſe blacks who being taken priſoners in battle, would, if not thus purchaſed, have been ſacrificed to the revenge of their conquerors: but this plea is manifeſtly falſe; from all the accounts we have of the diſpoſition of the negroes in thoſe early times, they appear to have been an innocent people, gentle and eaſy in their nature; rather averſe to war, as is the general diſpoſition of the natives of theſe warm climates; till being corrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by an intercourſe with the <hi>Europeans,</hi> and ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by the exceſſive uſe of ſpirituous liquors, they were induced to join them in their cruel deprada<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt their unhappy countrymen. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given of that tranſaction by <hi>Thomas Lediard</hi> in his naval hiſtory, at page 141, is in the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing words: <q>That Sir <hi>John Hawkins</hi> in his ſeveral voyages to the <hi>Canary</hi> iſlands, underſtanding that negroes were a very good commodity in <hi>Hiſpani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ola,</hi> (then ſettling by the <hi>Spaniards</hi>) and that they were eaſy to be had in great numbers on the coaſt of <hi>Guinea.</hi> Having opened his mind to his friends, he ſoon found adventurers for his undertaking; amongſt whom were Sir <hi>Lionel Docket,</hi> Sir <hi>Thomas Lodge,</hi> and others: and having fitted out three ſmall veſſels, manned only with 100 men, he departed from the coaſt of <hi>England</hi> in <hi>October</hi> 1562, and ſailed firſt to <hi>Teneriſſe,</hi> where he took in ſeveral refreſhments; from thence to the coaſt of <hi>Guinea,</hi> where he got in poſſeſſion, partly by the ſword, and by other means, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of three hundred of the natives, beſides ſeveral commodities which that country afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: with this booty he ſet ſail for the iſland of <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi> in the <hi>Weſt-Indies,</hi> where he diſpoſed of his negroes. Two years after, he went another voyage on the coaſt of <hi>Guinea;</hi> there he ſtaid ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral days at the iſland <hi>Sabula,</hi> where every day they took ſome of the inhabitants; burning and ravaging their towns: when having compleated their number of negroes, they ſet ſail for the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi>

It was ſome time before the <hi>Europeans</hi> found a more compendious way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing <hi>African</hi> ſlaves, by prevailing upon them to make war upon each other, and to ſell their priſoners,—Till then they ſeldom had any wars: But were in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral quiet and peaceable. But the white men firſt taught them drunkenneſs and avarice, and then hired them to ſell one another. Nay, by this means, even their kings are induced to ſell their own ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects.

So Mr. <hi>Moore</hi> (factor of the <hi>African</hi> company in 1730) informs us, "When the king of <hi>Barſalli</hi> wants goods or brandy, he ſends to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> governor at <hi>James'</hi> ſort, who immediately ſends a ſloop.—Againſt the time it arrives, he plunders ſome of his neighbours towns, ſelling the people for the goods he wants. At other times he falls upon one of his own towns, and makes bold to ſell his own ſubjects." So Monſ. <hi>Brue</hi> ſays, "I wrote to the king (not the ſame) "if he had a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient number of ſlaves I would treat with him. He ſeized three hundred of his own people, and ſent word, he was ready to deliver them for the goods." He adds, "Some of the natives are always ready" (when well paid) "to ſurprize and carry off their own countrymen. They come at night without noiſe, and if they find any lone cottage, ſurround it and carry off all the people."—<hi>Barbot,</hi> (another <hi>French</hi> factor) ſays, "Many of the ſlaves ſold by the negroes are priſoners of war, or taken in the incurſions they make into their enemy's territories.—Others are ſtolen. Abundance of little blacks of both ſexes, are ſtolen away by their neighbours, when found abroad on the road, or in the woods, or elſe in the corn-fields, at the time of year when their parents keep

                  <p>"SESTRO, Dec. 29, 1724. No trade to day, though many traders came on board. They informed us, that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are gone to war within land, and will bring priſoners enough in two or three days; in hopes of which we ſtay.</p>
                  <p>"The 30th. No trade yet: but our traders came on board to-day, and inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us the people had burnt four towns: So that to-morrow we expect ſlaves off.</p>
                  <p>"The 31ſt. Fair weather: but no trading yet. We ſee each night towns burning. But we hear, many of the <hi>Seſtro</hi> men are killed by the inland Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes: So that we fear this war will be unſucceſsful.</p>
                  <p>"The 2d. of January. Laſt night we ſaw a prodigious fire break out about eleven o'clock, and this morning ſee the town of <hi>Seſtro</hi> burnt down to the ground." (It contained ſome hundred houſes.) "So that we find their enemies are too hard

for them at preſent, and conſequently our trade ſpoiled here. Therefore about ſeven o'clock we weighed anchor, to proceed lower down."</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The ſecond extract taken from the journal of a Surgeon, who went from <hi>New-York</hi> on the ſame trade, is as follows. "The Commander of the veſſel ſent to acquaint the king, that he wanted a car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go of ſlaves. The king, promiſed to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh him, and in order to it, ſet out, deſigning to ſurprize ſome town, and make all the people priſoners. Some time after, the king ſent him word, he had not yet met with the deſired ſucceſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Having attempted to break up two towns, but having been twice repulſed: But that he ſtill hoped to procure the number of ſlaves. In this deſign he perſiſted, till he met his enemies in the field. A battle was fought, which laſted three days. And the engagement was ſo bloody, that four thouſand five hundred men were ſlain upon the ſpot." Such is the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner wherein the Negroes are procured! Thus the chriſtians preach the goſpel to the heathens!</p>
                  <p n="5">5. Thus they are <hi>procured.</hi> But in what numbers and in what manner are they carried to <hi>America?</hi>—Mr. <hi>Ander<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> in his Hiſtory of trade and commerce,

obſerves, "<hi>England</hi> ſupplies her Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can colonies with Negro-ſlaves, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in number to about an hundred thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand every year." That is, ſo many are taken on board our ſhips; but at leaſt ten thouſand of them die in the voyage: About a fourth part more die at the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Iſlands, in what is call the Seaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.

When they are brought down to the ſhore in order to be ſold, our ſurge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons thoroughly examine them, and that quite naked, women and men, without any diſtinction: Thoſe that are approved are ſet on one ſide. In the mean time a burning iron, with the arms or name of the Company, lies in the fire, with which they are marked on the breaſt. Before they are put into the ſhips, their maſters ſtrip them of all they have on their backs: So that they come on bord ſtark naked, women as well as men. It is common for ſeveral hundreds of them to be put on board one veſſel; where they are ſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together in as little room, as it is poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for them to be crowded. It is eaſy to ſuppoſe what a condition they muſt

                           <hi>Thomas Philips</hi> in his account of a voyage he made to <hi>Guinea,</hi> and from thence to <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> with, a cargo of ſlaves relates, "That they took ſeven hundred ſlaves on board. When they were brought in the veſſel, the men were all put in irons, two and two ſhackled together, to prevent their mutinying or ſwimming aſhore. The negroes, he ſays, are ſo loath to leave their own country, that they have often leaped out of the canoe, boat and ſhip, into the ſeas, and kept under water till they were drowned, to avoid being taken up, and ſaved by the boats which purſue them."—They had about twelve negroes who willingly drowned themſelves; others ſtarved themſelves to death— <hi>Philips</hi> was adviſed to cut off the legs and arms of ſome to terrify the reſt; (as other captains had done) but this he refuſed to do: From the time of his taking the negroes on board, to his arrival at <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> no leſs than three hundred and twenty died of various diſeaſes: Which the author ſays. "was to their great regret, after enduring much miſery and ſtench, ſo long, among a parcel of creatures naſtier than ſwine: No gold-finder, ſays <hi>Philips,</hi> can ſuffer ſuch noiſome drudgery as they do who carry negroes, having no reſpite from their afflictions ſo long as any of their ſlaves are alive." How unreaſonable was it in <hi>Philips,</hi> thus to reflect on negroes; could ſuch a number be crowded together in ſo warm a climate, even if they had all been healthy, without being extremely offenſive: How much more when ſo many lay ſick, dead and dying. He ſpeaks of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> people's great ſufferings by naſtineſs, ſtench, &amp;c. but he forgets the ſufferings of the poor blacks, which muſt have been incomparably greater than their's; not to mention the painful ſorrow, and anxiety of mind theſe diſtreſſed creatures muſt have laboured under.</p>

When the veſſels arrive at their deſtined port, the Negroes are again expoſed naked, to the eyes of all that flock together, and the examination of their purchaſers: Then they are ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated to the plantations of their ſeveral maſters, to ſee each other no more. Here you may ſee mothers hanging over their daughters, bedewing their naked breaſts with tears, and daughters clinging to their parents, till the whipper ſoon oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es them to part. And what can be more wretched than the condition they then enter upon? Baniſhed from their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, from their friends and relations for ever, from every comfort of life, they are reduced to a ſtate ſcarce any way preferable to that of beaſts of burthen. In general a few roots, not of the niceſt kind, uſually yams or potatoes, are their

food, and two rags, that neither ſcreen them from the heat of the day, nor the cold of the night their covering. Their ſleep is very ſhort, their labour continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al, and frequently above their ſtrength; ſo that death ſets many of them at liberty, before they have lived out half their days. The time they work in the <hi>Weſt Indies,</hi> is from day break to noon, and from two o'clock till dark: During which time they are attended by overſeers, who, if they think them dilatory, or think any thing not ſo well done as it ſhould be, whip them moſt unmercifully, ſo that you may ſee their bodies long after whealed and ſcarred uſually from the ſhoulders to the waiſt. And before they are ſuffered to go to their quarters, they have commonly ſomething to do, as collecting herbage for the horſes, or gathering fewel for the boilers. So that it is often paſt twelve, before they can get home. Hence if their food was not prepared, they are ſometimes called to labour again, before they can ſatisfy their hunger. And no excuſe will avail. If they are not in the field immediately, they muſt expect to feel the laſh. Did the Creator intend, that the nobleſt creatures in the viſible world, ſhould live ſuch a life as this!</p>

"For Rebellion," (that is, aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their native Liberty, which they have as much right to as to the air they breathe) "they faſten them down to the ground with crooked ſticks on every limb, and then applying fire by degrees, to the feet and hands, they burn them gradually upward to the head." <note n="*" place="bottom">

                        <p>How <hi>Britons</hi> can ſo readily admit of a change in their diſpoſition and ſentiments, as to practice in <hi>America</hi> what they abhor and deteſted in <hi>Britain,</hi> can be accounted for on no other principle, but as being the natural effect of ſlave-keeping, which as the celebrated <hi>Monteſquieu</hi> obſerves, "inſenſibly accuſtoms thoſe who are in the practice of it, to want all moral virtues, to become haughty, haſty hard hearted, paſſionate, voluptuous and cruel. The evil attendant on the condition of the poor ſlaves will end with their lives, and the merciful fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the family of mankind will doubtleſs look on their deep affliction, and where their hearts are thereby humbled, requite them good in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtate of exiſtence for their ſufferings in this: but with reſpect to their lordly oppreſſors, this horrible abuſe of their fellow men, will doubtleſs extend its baneful influence even into the regions of eternity. It is ſurpriſing that the thoughtful people, where ſlavery prevails ſhould ſo little ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert to its dreadful conſequent effects to themſelves and families, particularly on the neceſſity they are in of ſending away their offspring from under their own paternal care, in very early life, leſt their tender minds ſhould be corrupted, and every noble and generous ſentiments eradicated by the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion and cruelty they are daily witneſſes of.— That parents ſhould be thus incapacitated and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prived of the opportunity and ſatisfaction of form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the minds of their offspring to virtue and happineſs, but that this moſt ſacred and delightful truſt muſt be left to the care of the hireling and the ſtranger, muſt to every tender thinking parent, appear an evil of ſo afflictive a nature, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the divine order, that no human advantage can compenſate for.</p>
                        <p>The author of the hiſtory of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> wrote a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the year 1740, in his account of the ſufferings of the negroes, ſays, The people of that iſland have indeed the ſevereſt ways of puniſhing; no country exceeds them in a barbarous treatment of their ſlaves, or in the cruel methods by which they are put to death. After confirming what is before ſaid<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> he adds, "They ſtarve them to death, with a loaf hanging over their mouths. I have ſeen theſe unfortunate wretches gnaw the fleſh off their ſhoulders, and expire in all the frightful agonies of one under the moſt horrible tortures. He adds, I incline to touch the hardſhip which theſe poor creatures ſuffer in the tendereſt manner, from a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular regard which I have to many of their maſters; but I cannot conceal their ſad circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances entirely: the moſt trivial error is puniſhed with terrible whipping. I have ſeen ſome of them treated in that cruel manner, for no other reaſon but to ſatisfy the brutiſh pleaſure of an overſeer, who has their puniſhment moſtly at his diſcretion. I have ſeen their bodies all in a gore of blood, the ſkin torn off their backs with the cruel whip, beaten pepper and ſalt rubbed in the wounds, and a large ſtick of ſealing-wax dropped leiſurely upon them. It is no wonder, (adds this author) if the horrid pain of ſuch inhuman tortures incline them to rebel." The ſame author gives us extracts of ſome of the laws of <hi>Jamaica</hi> relating to the puniſhment of ſlaves, taken as he ſays, from a general collection of the plantation laws, the printed ſtatutes, or the ſecre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary's-office, viz.</p>
                        <p>"If any ſlave by puniſhment from his owner for running away, or other offence, ſuffer in life or limb, none ſhall be liable to the law for the ſame; but whoſoever ſhall kill a ſlave out of wilfulneſs, wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonneſs, or bloody mindedneſs, ſhall ſuffer three months impriſonment, and pay fifty pounds to the owner of the ſlave. If the party ſo offending be a ſervant, he or ſhe ſhall have on the bare back thirty-nine laſhes, and alſo (after the expiration of the term with his or her maſter or miſtreſs) ſhall ſerve the owner of the deceaſed ſlave the full term of four years. If any perſon kill a ſlave ſtealing or running away, or found by night out of his owner's ground, road, or common path, ſuch perſon ſhall not be ſubject to any damage or action for the ſame.</p>
                        <p>"Thoſe that go out in parties to reduce the negroes, ſhall receive from the treaſurer for every rebellious negro that ſhall be killed, bringing in his head to any juſtice, forty pounds; for every negro taken and brought in alive, and not maimed, ten pounds, to be paid by the owner, who is hereby obliged under the penalty of fifty pounds, to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſuch ſlave ſo taken; and in caſe the owner cannot be found, then the treaſurer ſhall pay the ten pounds, receive the ſlave, ſell and tranſport him, and retain the produce to be employed in the ſaid ſervice."</p>
                        <p>The following advertiſement was taken from one of the <hi>North-Carolina</hi> news papers. "Run-away laſt <hi>November,</hi> from the ſubſcriber, a negro fellow named <hi>Zeb,</hi> about 36 years of age, about 5 feet 8 inches high, a very good cooper by trade &amp;c.—As he is outlawed, I will pay twenty pounds proclamation money out of what the act of aſſembly allows in ſuch caſes, to any perſon who ſhall produce his head ſevered from his body, and five pounds pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation money if brought home alive."</p>

                        <p>An advertiſement of the ſame kind was printed in <hi>London,</hi> in the general evening-poſt, <hi>Jan</hi> 1, 1774, ſaid to be taken from the <hi>Williamſburgh</hi> gazette, where after deſcribing the negro, the maſter adds, "The ſaid fellow is outlawed, and I will give ten pounds reward for his head ſevered from his body, or forty ſhillings if brought alive." As ſtrange as ſuch publications may appear to ſuch whoſe hearts as are not hardned by the practice of ſlavery, yet I am informed advertiſements of this kind are fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent in the ſouthern colonies.</p>
                        <p>It is alledged by the planters in excuſe for theſe unnatural, theſe monſtrous cruelties, that the greateſt ſeverity, the moſt cruel puniſhments, are abſolutely neceſſary for the management of ſlaves, on account of thoſe train of vices which ſlavery neceſſarily introduces. A late author remarks how ſhocking it is to think that thoſe unhappy victims muſt from the nature of the thing become danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and refactory, in proportion to the greatneſs and generoſity of their minds.</p>
                        <p>Can there be a more dangerous maxim, than that neceſſity is a plea for injuſtice? For who ſhall fix the degree of this neceſſity? What villain ſo atrocious who may not urge this excuſe? or as <hi>Milton</hi> expreſſes it—</p>

A particular inſtance of the deſtruction of human beings, under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of neceſſity, is related by captain Cook, in his voyage round the world, in company with meſſieurs <hi>Banks</hi> and <hi>Solander,</hi> in the year 1768, being at <hi>Rio Janiero,</hi> one, if not the principal town of <hi>Brazil;</hi> he relates, page 29, "That the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, who are very numerous, conſiſts of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe, Negroes</hi> and <hi>Indians.</hi> The townſhip of <hi>Rio Janiero,</hi> which he was told was but a ſmall part of the province, is ſaid to contain thirty-ſeven thouſand white people, and ſix hundred and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty nine thouſand blacks, many of whom are free, in the proportion of ſeventeen to one."</p>

                  <p n="4">IV. 1. This is the plain, un-aggravat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed matter of fact. Such is the manner wherein our <hi>African</hi> ſlaves are procured: Such the manner wherein they are remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their native land, and wherein they are treaed in our Plantations. I would now enquire, whether theſe things can be defended, on the principles of even hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then honeſty? Whether they can be recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled (ſetting the Bible out of the queſtion) with any degree of either juſtice or mercy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The grand plea is, "They are au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thorized by law." But can law, human law, change the nature of things? Can
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:013145_0121_0F8EC2283AB27958"/>
it turn darkneſs into light, or evil into good? By no means. Notwithſtanding ten thouſand laws, right is right, and wrong is wrong ſtill. There muſt ſtill remain an eſſential difference between juſtice and injuſtice, cruelty and mercy. So that ſtill I aſk, Who can reconcile this treatment of the negroes, firſt and laſt, with either mercy or juſtice.</p>
                  <p>Where is the juſtice of inflicting the ſevereſt evils, on thoſe that have done us no wrong? Of depriving thoſe that ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver injured us in word or deed, of every comfort of life? Of tearing them from their native country, and depriving them of liberty itſelf? To which an <hi>Angolan,</hi> has the ſame natural right as an <hi>Engliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man,</hi> and on which he ſets as high a value? Yea where is the juſtice of taking away the lives of innocent, inoffenſive men? Murdering thouſands of them in their own land, by the hands of their own countrymen: Many thouſands, year after year, on ſhipboard, and then caſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them like dung into the ſea! And tens of thouſands in that cruel ſlavery, to which they are ſo unjuſtly reduced?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. But waving, for the preſent, all other conſiderations, I ſtrike at the root of this complicated villainy. I abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deny all ſlave-holding to be conſiſtent
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:013145_0121_0F8EC2283AB27958"/>
with any degreee of even natural juſtice.</p>
                  <p>I cannot place this in a clearer light, than that great ornament of his profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, judge <hi>Blackſtone</hi> has already done. Part of his words are as follows:</p>
                  <p>"The three origins of the right of ſlavery aſſigned by <hi>Juſtinian,</hi> are all built upon falſe foundations. 1. Slavery is ſaid to ariſe from captivity in war. The conqueror having a right to the life of his captive, if he ſpares that, has then a right to deal with him as he pleaſes. But this is untrue, if taken generally, That by the law of nations, a man has a right to kill his enemy. He has only a right to kill him in particular caſes in caſes of abſolute neceſſity for ſelf-defence. And it is plain, this abſolute neceſſity did not ſubſiſt, ſince he did not kill him, but made him priſoner. War itſelf is juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiable only on principles of ſelf-preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Therefore it gives us no right o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver priſoners, but to hinder their hurt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us by confining them. Much leſs can it give a right to torture, or kill, or even to enſlave an enemy when the war is over. Since therefore the right of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our priſoners ſlaves, depends on a ſuppoſed right of ſlaughter, that found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation failing, the conſequence which is drawn from it muſt fail likewiſe."</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="unknown:013145_0122_0F8EC228A2BF7260"/>"It is ſaid, Secondly, ſlavery may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, by one man's ſelling himſelf to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. And it is true, a man may ſell him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to work for another: But he cannot ſell himſelf to be a ſlave, as above defined. Every ſale implies an equivalent given to the ſeller, in lieu of what he transfers to the buyer. But what equivalent can be given for life or liberty? His property likewiſe, with the very price which he ſeems to receive, devolves <hi>ipſo facto</hi> to his maſter, the inſtant he becomes his ſlave: In this caſe therefore the buyer gives nothing, and the ſeller receives nothing. Of what validity then can a ſale be, which deſtroys the very principles upon which all ſales are founded?"</p>
                  <p>"We are told, Thirdly, that men may be <hi>born ſlaves,</hi> by being the children of ſlaves. But this being built on the two former rights, muſt fall together with them. If neither captivity, nor contract can by the plain law of nature and reaſon, reduce the parent to a ſtate of ſlavery, much leſs can they reduce the offspring." It clearly follows, that all ſlavery is as ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reconcileable to juſtice as to mercy.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. That ſlave-holding is utterly incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with mercy, is almoſt too plain to need a proof. Indeed it is ſaid, "That theſe negroes being priſoners of war, our
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:013145_0122_0F8EC228A2BF7260"/>
captains and factors buy them merely to ſave them from being put to death. And is not this mercy?" I anſwer, 1. Did Sir <hi>John Hawkins,</hi> and many others, ſeize upon men, women and children, who were at peace in their own fields or houſes, merely to ſave them from death? 2. Was it to ſave them from death, that they knock'd out the brains of thoſe they could not bring away? 3. Who occaſioned and fomented thoſe wars, wherein theſe poor creatures were taken priſoners? Who excited them by money, by drink, by every poſſible means, to fall upon one another? Was it not themſelves? They know in their own conſcience it was, if they have any conſcience left. But 4. To bring the matter to a ſhort iſſue. Can they ſay before GOD, That they ever took a ſingle voyage, or bought a ſingle negro from this motive? They cannot. They well know, to get money, not to ſave lives, was the whole and ſole ſpring of their motions.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. But if this manner of procuring and treating negroes is not conſiſtent either with mercy or juſtice, yet there is a plea for it which every man of buſineſs will acknowledge to be quite ſufficient. Fifty years ago, one meeting an eminent ſtateſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man in the lobby of the houſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:013145_0123_0F8EC22970DD8968"/>
ſaid, "You have been long talking about juſtice and equity. Pray which is this bill? Equity or juſtice?" He anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, very ſhort, and plain, "D—n juſtice: It is neceſſity." Here alſo the ſlave-holder fixes his foot: Here he reſts the ſtrength of his cauſe. "If it is not quite right, yet it <hi>muſt</hi> be ſo: There is an abſolute <hi>neceſſity</hi> for it. It is neceſſary we ſhould procure ſlaves: And when we have procured them, it is neceſſary to uſe them with ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity, conſidering their ſtupidity, ſtub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bornneſs and wickedneſs."</p>
                  <p>I anſwer, You ſtumble at the threſhold: I deny that villany is ever neceſſary. It is impoſſible that it ſhould ever be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, for any reaſonable creature to violate all the laws of juſtice, mercy, and truth. No circumſtances can make it neceſſary for a man to burſt in ſunder all the ties of humanity. It can never be neceſſary for a rational being to ſink himſelf below a brute. A man can be under no neceſſity, of degrading himſelf into a wolf. The abſurdity of the ſuppoſition is ſo glaring, that one would wonder any one can help ſeeing it.</p>
                  <p n="6">6. This in general. But to be more particular, I aſk, 1. What is neceſſary? And, ſecondly, To what end? It may be be anſwered, "The whole method now
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013145_0123_0F8EC22970DD8968"/>
uſed by the original purchaſers of negroes, is neceſſary to the furniſhing our colonies yearly with an hundred thouſand ſlaves." I grant, this is neceſſary to that end. But how is that end neceſſary? How will you prove it neceſſary, that one hundred, that one of thoſe ſlaves ſhould be procured? "Why, it is neceſſary to my gaining an hundred thouſand pounds." Perhaps ſo: But how is <hi>this</hi> neceſſary? It is very poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible you might be both a better and an happier man, if you had not a quarter of it. I deny that your gaining one thouſand is neceſſary, either to your preſent or eternal happineſs. "But however you muſt allow, theſe ſlaves are neceſſary for the cultivation of our iſlands; inaſmuch as white men are not able to labour in hot climates<note n="†" place="bottom">
                        <p>It is not propoſed to remove the negroes from labouring in the ſeveral provinces and iſlands where they are now employed; in order to employ white men in their ſtead, what is propoſed, is only to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any farther import of negroes, except thoſe who may come voluntarily and in a free condition; and to fall upon ſuch juſt regulations and proper encouragement with reſpect to thoſe already a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt us, that from dangerous grudging ſlaves, they may become willing hearted labourers, who having an intereſt in the peace and welfare of the country, will be parties in its ſtrength and ſupport. But whilſt deficiencies by the death of the labouring ſlaves can be ſo eaſily made up by the continual freſh imports from <hi>Guinea,</hi> and the planters find it cheaper to make new purchaſes than to raiſe the children, or ſpare and cheriſh the parents at thoſe already in their ſervice, little amendment can be expected in the hardſhip they are put to, and the cruelties exerciſed upon them. Surely the number already in our colonies and iſlands, which on a calculation made four or five years paſt, was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween eight and nine hundred thouſand, beſides that there has been a vaſt number, ſaid to be about <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

                        <p>If an end was put to the import of negroes, and the odious and cruel diſtinction of maſter and ſlaves, with all its attendant horrors ſhould ceaſe, many labouring people from <hi>Europe,</hi> who are new diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged from an apprenſion of being put on a level with ſlaves, would probably be willing to come over and engage in the ſervice.</p>
                        <p>
                           <hi>John Miller,</hi> profeſſor of law at <hi>Glaſgow,</hi> in his late <hi>obſervations concerning diſtinction of ranks in ſociety,</hi> obſerves, "That the ſlavery eſtabliſhed in our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies is an object of great importance, and is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with difficulties which cannot be eaſily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. It has been thought that the manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our plantations requires a labour in which free men would not be willing to engage, and which the white people are from their conſtitution in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>capable of performing. How far this opinion is well founded according to the preſent manner of labouring in that part of the world, ſeems difficult to determine, as it has never been properly examin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by thoſe who are in a condition to aſcertain the facts in queſtion. But there is ground to believe, that the inſtitution of ſlavery is the chief circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance that has prevented thoſe contrivances to ſhorten and facilitate the more laborious employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the people, which takes place in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, where freedom has been introduced. With regard to the planting of ſugar, experiments have been made in ſome of the iſlands, from which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, that in ſome ſpecies of cultivation, cattle might be employed with advantage, and that the number of ſlaves might be greatly diminiſhed But theſe experiments have been little regarded, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to the former uſage, and in oppoſition to a lucrative branch of trade which theſe innovaſions would in a great meaſure deſtroy. At any rate, the intereſt of our colonies ſeems to demand, that the negroes ſhould be better treated, and even that they ſhould be raiſed to a better condition.—The author of a late elegant account of our <hi>American</hi> ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, has propoſed, that ſmall wages ſhould be given them, as an encouragement to induſtry. If this meaſure were once begun, it is probable that the maſter would ſoon find the utility of puſhing it to a greater extent. Nothing can appear more aſtoniſhing than the little attention that has hitherto been paid to any improvement of this nature, after the good effects of them have been ſo fully illuſtrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the caſe of the villains in <hi>Europe.</hi> At the ſame time, it affords a curious ſpectacle to obſerve, that the ſame people who talk in ſo high a ſtrain of political liberty, and who conſider the privilege of impoſing their own taxes, as one of the unalien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able rights of mankind, ſhould make no ſcruple of reducing a great proportion of the inhabitants into circumſtances by which they are not only deprived of property, but almoſt of every right whatſoever. Fortune, perhaps never produced a ſituation more calculated to ridicule a grave and even a liberal hypotheſis, or to ſhow how little the conduct of men is at bottom directed by any philoſophical principles."</p>
                        <p>We have accounts from <hi>England</hi> of ſome regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that have taken place in the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> colonies, which do the <hi>Spaniards</hi> much honour, and are cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly worthy our imitation; they are to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing effect:—"As ſoon as a ſlave is landed, his name, price, &amp;c. are regiſtered in a public regiſter, and the maſter is obliged by law, to allow him <hi>one working day</hi> in every week to himſelf, beſides ſundays: ſo that if the ſlave chuſes to work for his maſter on that day, he receives the wages of a freeman for it; and whatever he gains by his labour on that day, is ſo ſecured to him by law, that the maſter cannot deprive him of it. As ſoon as the ſlave is able to purchaſe <hi>another working day,</hi> the maſter is obliged to ſell it to him at a proportion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able price, viz. one fifth part of his original coſt, and ſo likewiſe the remaining four days at the ſame rate, as ſoon as the ſlave is able to redeem them; after which <hi>he is abſolutely free.</hi>" This is ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to induſtry, that even the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dolent would be tempted to exert themſelves. Men who have thus worked out their freedom, are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ured to the labour of the country, and are certainly the moſt uſeful ſubjects that a colony can acquire.</p>
                     </note>." I anſwer, 1. It were bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013145_0124_0F8EC22A2A8F7648"/>
that all thoſe iſlands ſhould remain uncultivated for ever, yea, it were more deſirable that they were all together ſunk in the depth of the ſea, than that they ſhould be cultivated at ſo high a price, as the violation of juſtice, mercy, and truth. But, Secondly, the ſuppoſition on which
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:013145_0124_0F8EC22A2A8F7648"/>
you ground your argument is falſe. For white men, even <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> are well able to labour in hot climates: provided they are temperate both in meat and drink, and that they inure themſelves to it by degrees. I ſpeak no more than I know by experience. It appears from the ther<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mometer,
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:013145_0125_0F8EC22AE2E19C78"/>
that the ſummer heat in <hi>Georgia,</hi> is frequently equal to that in <hi>Barbadoes,</hi> yea to that under the line. And yet I and my family, (eight in number) did em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy all our ſpare time there, in felling of trees and clearing of ground, as hard labour as any negro need be employed in. The <hi>German</hi> family likewiſe, forty in number,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:013145_0125_0F8EC22AE2E19C78"/>
were employed in all manner of labour. And this was ſo far from impairing our health, that we all continued perfectly well, while the idle ones all round about us, were ſwept away as with a peſtilence. It is not true therefore that white men are not able to labour, even in hot climates, full as well as black. But if they were not, it would be better that none ſhould
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:013145_0126_0F8EC22BD31D20A0"/>
labour there, that the work ſhould be left undone, than that myriads of innocent men ſhould be murdered, and myriads more dragged into the baſeſt ſlavery.</p>

To take that opportunity, of rub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing pepper and ſalt into their raw fleſh? To drop burning ſealing wax upon their ſkin? To caſtrate them? To cut off half their foot with an axe? To hang them on gibbets, that they may die by inches, with heat, and hunger, and thirſt? To pin them down to the ground, and then burn them by degrees, from the feet, to the head? To roaſt them alive? When did a Turk or a Heathen find it neceſſary to uſe a fellow-creature thus?</p>
                  <p>I pray, to what end is this uſage neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary? "Why, to prevent their running away: And to keep them conſtantly to their labour, that they may not idle away their time. So miſerably ſtupid is this race of men, yea, ſo ſtubborn, and ſo wicked." Allowing them to be as ſtupid as you ſay, to whom is that ſtupidity owing? Without queſtion it lies altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther at the door of their inhuman maſters:
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:013145_0127_0F8EC23049362780"/>
Who give them no means, no opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of improving their underſtanding: And indeed leave them no motive, either from hope or fear, to attempt any ſuch thing. They were no way remarkable for ſtupidity, while they remained in their own country: The inhabitants of <hi>Africa</hi> where they have equal motives and equal means of improvement, are not inferior to the inhabitants of <hi>Europe:</hi> To ſome of them they are greatly ſuperior. Impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially ſurvey in their own country, the natives of <hi>Benin</hi> and the natives of <hi>Lap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land.</hi> Compare, (ſetting prejudice aſide) the <hi>Samoeids</hi> and the <hi>Angolans.</hi> And on which ſide does the advantage lie, in point of underſtanding? Certainly the <hi>African</hi> is in no reſpect inferior to the <hi>European.</hi>— Their ſtupidity therefore in our planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is not natural; otherwiſe than it is the natural effect of their condition.— Conſequently it is not their fault, but <hi>your's:</hi> You muſt anſwer for it, before GOD and man.</p>
                  <p n="9">9. "But their ſtupidity is not the only reaſon of our treating them with ſeverity. For it is hard to ſay, which is the greateſt, This, or their ſtubbornneſs and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs."—It may be ſo:—But do not theſe, as well as the other, lie at <hi>your</hi> door? Are not ſtubbornneſs, cunning, pilfering, and
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:013145_0128_0F8EC2316B901980"/>
divers others vices, the natural, neceſſary fruits of ſlavery? Is not this an obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on which has been made, in every age and nation.—And what means have you uſed to remove this ſtubbornneſs? Have you tried what mildneſs and gentleneſs would do? I knew one that did: That had prudence and patience to make the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment: Mr. <hi>Hugh Bryan,</hi> who then lived on the borders of <hi>South-Carolina.</hi>— And what was the effect? Why, that all his negroes (And he had no ſmall number of them) loved and reverenced him as a father, and chearfully obeyed him out of love. Yea, they were more afraid of a frown from <hi>him,</hi> than of many blows from an overſeer. And what pains have <hi>you</hi> taken, what method have you uſed, to reclaim them from their wickedneſs? Have you carefully taught them, "That there is a GOD, a wiſe, powerful, merciful Being, the Creator and Governor of Heaven and Earth? That he has appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a day wherein he will judge the world, will take an account of all our thoughts, words and actions? That in that day he will reward every child of man according to his works: That "then the righteous ſhall inherit the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world: And the wicked ſhall be caſt into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:013145_0128_0F8EC2316B901980"/>
fire, prepared for the devil and his angels." If you have not done this, if you have taken no pains or thought about the matter, can you wonder at their wickedneſs? What wonder, if they ſhould cut your throat? And if they did, whom could you thank for it but yourſelf? You firſt acted the villain in making them ſlaves, (whether you ſtole them or bought them.) You kept them ſtupid and wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by cutting them off from all appor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities of improving either in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge or virtue: And now you aſſign their want of wiſdom and goodneſs as the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon for uſing them worſe than brute beaſts!</p>
                  <p n="5">V. 1. It remains only, to make a little application of the preceding obſervations. —But to whom ſhould that application be made? That may bear a queſtion. Should we addreſs ourſelves to the public at large? What effect can this have? It may inflame the world againſt the guilty, but is not likely to remove that guilt. Should we appeal to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> nation in general? This alſo is ſtriking wide: And is never likely to procure any redreſs, for the ſore evil we complain of.—As little would it in all probability avail, to apply to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament. So many things, which <hi>ſeem</hi> of greater importance lie before them that
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:013145_0129_0F8EC231A66C97F8"/>
they are not likely to attend to this. I therefore add a few words to thoſe who are more immediately concerned, whether captains, merchants or planters.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. And, firſt, to the captains employed in this trade. Moſt of <hi>you</hi> know, the country of <hi>Guinea:</hi> Several parts of it at leaſt, between the river <hi>Senegal</hi> and the kingdom of <hi>Angola.</hi> Perhaps now, by <hi>your</hi> means, part of it is become a dreary uncultivated wilderneſs, the inhabitants being all murdered or carried away, ſo that there are none left to till the ground. But you well know, how populous, how fruitful, how pleaſant it was a few years ago. You know the people were not ſtupid, not wanting in ſenſe, conſidering the few means of improvement they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed. Neither did you find them ſavage, fierce, cruel, treacherous, or unkind to ſtrangers. On the contrary, they were in moſt parts a ſenſible and ingenious people. They were kind and friendly, courteous and obliging, and remarkably fair and juſt in their dealings. Such are the men whom you hire their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen, to tear away from this lovely country; part by ſtealth, part by force, part made captives in thoſe wars, which you raiſe or foment on purpoſe. You have ſeen them torn away, children from
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:013145_0129_0F8EC231A66C97F8"/>
their parents, parents from their children: Huſbands from their wives, wives from their beloved huſbands, brethren and ſiſters from each other. You have drag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged them who had never done you any wrong, perhaps in chains, from their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſhore. You have forced them into your ſhips like an herd of ſwine, them who had ſouls immortal as your own: (Only ſome of them have leaped into the ſea, and reſolutely ſtayed under water, till they could ſuffer no more from you.) You have ſtowed them together as cloſe as ever they could lie, without any regard either to decency or convenience. —And when many of them had been poiſoned by foul air, or had ſunk under various hardſhips, you have ſeen their remains delivered to the deep, till the ſea ſhould give up his dead. You have carried the ſurvivors into the vileſt ſlavery, never to end but with life: Such ſlavery as is not found among the <hi>Turks</hi> at <hi>Algiers,</hi> no, nor among the heathens in <hi>America.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. May I ſpeak plainly to you? I muſt. Love conſtrains me: Love to <hi>you,</hi> as well as to thoſe you are concerned with.</p>
                  <p>Is there a GOD? You know there is. Is He a juſt GOD? Then there muſt be a ſtate of retribution: A ſtate wherein the juſt GOD will reward every man according to
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:013145_0130_0F8EC2326180EF50"/>
his works. Then what reward will he render to <hi>you?</hi> O think betimes! Before you drop into eternity! Think now, <hi>He ſhall have judgment without mercy, that ſhewed no mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Are you <hi>a man?</hi> Then you ſhould have an <hi>human</hi> heart. But have you indeed? What is your heart made of? Is there no ſuch principle as compaſſion there? Do you never <hi>feel</hi> another's pain? Have you no ſympathy? No ſenſe of human woe? No pity for the miſerable? When you ſaw the flowing eyes, the heaving breaſts, or the bleeding ſides and tortured limbs of your fellow-creatures, was you a ſtone, or a brute? Did you look upon them with the eyes of a tiger? When you ſqueezed the agonizing creatures down in the ſhip, or when you threw their poor mangled remains into the ſea, had you no relent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing? Did not one tear drop from your eye, one ſigh eſcape from your breaſt? Do you feel no relenting <hi>now?</hi> If you do not, you muſt go on, till the meaſure of your iniquities is full. Then will the great GOD deal with <hi>you,</hi> as you have dealt with <hi>them,</hi> and require all their blood at your hands. And at that day it ſhall be more tolerable for <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gemorrah</hi> than for <hi>you!</hi> But if your heart does relent, though in a ſmall degree, know it is a call from
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:013145_0130_0F8EC2326180EF50"/>
the GOD of love. And to day, if you hear his voice, harden not your heart.— To day reſolve, GOD being your helper, to eſcape for your life.—Regard not money! All that a man hath will he give for his life? Whatever you loſe, loſe not your ſoul: nothing can countervail that loſs. Immediately quit the horrid trade: At all events, be an honeſt man.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. This equally concerns every mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, who is engaged in the ſlave-trade. It is <hi>you</hi> that induce the <hi>African</hi> villain, to ſell his countrymen; and in order there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, to ſteal, rob, murder men, women and children without number: By enabling the <hi>Engliſh</hi> villain to pay him for ſo doing; whom you over pay for his execrable labour. It is <hi>your</hi> money, that is the ſpring of all, that impowers him to go on: So that whatever he or the <hi>African</hi> does in this matter, is all <hi>your</hi> act and deed. And is your conſcience quite reconciled to this? Does it never reproach you at all? Has gold entirely blinded your eyes, and ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pified your heart? Can you ſee, can you <hi>feel</hi> no harm therein? Is it doing as you would be done to? Make the caſe your own. "Maſter, (ſaid a ſlave at <hi>Liverpool</hi> to the merchant that owned him) "what if ſome of my countrymen were to come here, and take away my miſtreſs, and maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter

His an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was worthy of a man: "I will never buy a ſlave more while I live." O let his reſolution be yours! Have no more any part in this deteſtable buſineſs. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly leave it to thoſe unfeeling wretches, "Who laugh at human nature and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion!" Be <hi>you</hi> a man! Not a wolf, a devourer of the human ſpecies! Be mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful, that you may obtain mercy!</p>
                  <p n="5">5. And this equally concerns every gentleman that has an eſtate in our <hi>Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can</hi> plantations: Yea all ſlave-holders of whatever rank and degree; ſeeing <hi>men-buyers</hi> are exactly on a level with <hi>men-ſtealers.</hi> Indeed you ſay, "I pay honeſtly for my goods: and I am not concerned to know how they are come by." Nay, but you are: You are deeply concerned, to know they are honeſtly come by. Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe you are partaker with a thief, and are not a jot honeſter than him. But you know, they are not honeſtly come by: You know they are procured by means, nothing near ſo innocent as picking of pockets, houſe-breaking, or robbery upon the highway. You know they are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured by a deliberate ſeries of more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicated villany, of fraud, robbery and

murder) than was ever practiſed either by <hi>Mahometans</hi> or <hi>Pagans:</hi> in particular by murders, of all kinds; by the blood of the innocent poured upon the ground like water. Now it is <hi>your</hi> money that pays the merchant, and thro' him the captain, and the <hi>African</hi> butchers. <hi>You</hi> therefore are guilty, yea, principally guilty, of all theſe frauds, robberies and murders. You are the ſpring that puts all the reſt in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: they would not ſtir a ſtep without <hi>you:</hi>—Therefore the blood of all theſe wretches, who die before their time, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in their country, or elſewhere lies upon <hi>your</hi> head. <hi>The blood of thy brother,</hi> (for, whether thou wilt believe it or no, ſuch he is in the ſight of him that made him) <hi>crieth againſt thee from the earth,</hi> from the ſhip, and from the waters. O, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it coſts, put a ſtop to its cry before it be too late. Inſtantly, at any price, were it the half of your goods, deliver thyſelf from blood-guiltineſs! Thy hands, thy bed, thy furniture, thy houſe, thy lands are at preſent ſtained with blood. Surely it is enough; accumulate no more guilt: ſpill no more the blood of the innocent! Do not hire another to ſhed blood: Do not pay him for doing it! Whether you are a chriſtian or no, ſhew yourſelf a man; be not more ſavage than a lion or a bear!</p>
                  <p n="6">
                     <pb n="56" facs="unknown:013145_0132_0F8EC233F188B1D0"/>6. Perhaps you will ſay, "I do not <hi>buy</hi> any negroes: I only <hi>uſe</hi> thoſe left me by my father."—So far is well: but is it enough to ſatisfy your own conſcience? Had your father, have <hi>you,</hi> has any man living, a right to uſe another as a ſlave? It cannot be, even ſetting revelation aſide. It cannot be, that either war, or contract, can give any man ſuch a property in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther as he has in his ſheep and oxen. Much leſs is it poſſible, that any child of man, ſhould ever be <hi>born a ſlave.</hi> Liberty is the right of every human creature, as ſoon as he breathes the vital air. And no human law can deprive him of that right, which he derives from the law of nature.</p>
                  <p>If therefore you have any regard to juſtice, (to ſay nothing of mercy, nor of the revealed law of GOD) render unto all their due. Give liberty to whom liberty is due, that is to every child of man, to every partaker of human nature. Let none ſerve you but by his own act and deed, by his own voluntary choice.— Away with all whips, all chains, all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſion! Be gentle towards all men. And ſee that you invariably do unto every one, as you would he ſhould do unto <hi>you.</hi>

                  <argument>
                     <p>SIMILAR cauſes will produce ſimilar effects; the dreadful conſequence of ſlavery is the ſame amongſt every people and in every nation where it prevails: this truth is verified in the following accounts of the inhuman treatment the negroes met with both from the <hi>Hollanders</hi> and the <hi>French.</hi>
                     </p>
                  </argument>
                  <p>The firſt is taken from the late writings of <hi>Edward Bancroft,</hi> an <hi>Engliſh</hi> phyſician, who reſided ſome years in that part of <hi>America,</hi> called <hi>Dutch Guiana,</hi> which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cludes the ſeveral ſettlements of <hi>Surinam, Barbices, Demarara,</hi> &amp;c. The inſenſibility with which this author relates and vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicates the cruelties and indignities ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſed, by the <hi>Dutch,</hi> on the miſerable <hi>Africans,</hi> ſhew that the advantage accruing to him from the labour of the ſlaves, as well as his connection with their oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors, had its uſual and natural effects, in obſcuring his underſtanding, and hardning his heart againſt the dictates of reaſon and humanity.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="59" facs="unknown:013145_0133_0F8EC234E448E8F0"/>The <hi>French</hi> author appears to have been in a very different ſituation; he was an officer belonging to the troops quartered in the iſland <hi>Mauritus,</hi> now called <hi>The Iſle of France,</hi> who not reaping any advantage from the labour of the ſlaves, nor having any dependence on the planters, his mind remained ſo unprejudiced, that the dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of reaſon and tender feelings of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, had free liberty to exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
                  <p>Doctor <hi>Bancroft,</hi> whilſt he is giving his readers a genuine relation of the prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious oppreſſion and cruelty exerciſed on the negroes, advances ſuch arguments in defence of the practice of ſlavery, as are, indeed, a diſhonour to reaſon, and ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to humanity. He tells us, <q>That the labour of the country is almoſt wholly performed by negroes—that they are kept at a ſubmiſſive and hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſtance, by ſeverity of diſcipline,</q> which he is ſo hardned as to ſay, <q>not only contributes to the ſafety of the white inhabitants, but even the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſlaves, becauſe, adds he, the impoſſibility of attaining is ever found to deſtroy the deſire of enjoyment, and rigid treatment, by annihilating every hope of liberty, renders the ſlaves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the enjoyment of ſlavery.</q>—
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:013145_0134_0F8EC23576223338"/>
He acknowledges, <q>That the negroes are indeed ſpurred to induſtry by the whip of correction, which is ever at their heels, and not ſparingly exerciſed; but, that there is no medium: either the minds of the ſlaves muſt be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by abject ſlavery, or the lives of the maſters are in imminent danger: For this reaſon (he ſays) they have been oppreſſed by many humiliating penalties and diſtinctions. The evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of ſlaves relating to white perſons are of no validity. An attempt to ſtrike a white inhabitant is puniſhed with death. Their maſters or overſeers have not only the power of inflicting cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral puniſhment, but are in ſome meaſure allowed to exerciſe a right over their lives, ſince the putting a negro to death is attended only with a pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niary puniſhment. In which ſituation, he confeſſes, they are ſubject to many complicated ſpecies of miſery, expoſed to the tyrann<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="61" facs="unknown:013145_0134_0F8EC23576223338"/>
ſlavery, has upon the heart and reaſon of men, otherwiſe of good judgment.— Hence he adds, <q>That tho' this treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has the appearance of cruelty, and cannot be reconciled to the principles of juſtice and equity, yet many things which are repugnant to humanity, may be excuſed on account of their neceſſity and for ſelf-preſervation.</q>—Speaking of the proviſion made for the negroes in food and cloathing, he ſays, <q>The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of maintaining them in this climate is very trifling—they are aſſigned a piece of ground, from this the ſlave is ſupplied with a ſufficient ſtock for his ſuſtenance; on which however he is not allowed to labour but only on ſundays; receiving from his maſter a weekly allowance of dried fiſh to the amount of a pound and an half; which is all that his maſter con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes towards his food. The females receive the ſame treatment, and the drink of both is nothing but water: yet from this water and vegetables, with a morſel of dried fiſh, theſe people derive ſufficient nutriment to ſuſtain the hardeſt labour in the moſt enervat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing climate. The cloathing of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groes (who work in the fields) is ſcarce ſufficient to anſwer the demands of</q>

indignation againſt the murderer, or commiſeration for the unhappy victim; they ſeemed quite hardned to ſuch ſcenes. He heard but one perſon take any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of notice of the matter.</p>
                  <p>Another inſtance fell under the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate notice of a perſon of credit, when in the iſland of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> now reſiding in this city. Hearing a grievous cry, he went to the place from whence it came, where he ſaw a young negro wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of about eighteen years of age, ſwung by her hands, with heavy weights at her feet, and a man laſhing her naked body with a hard whip; making pauſes from time to time, and flinging pickle or ſalt and water on the wounds, the whip had made. The ſight was ſo hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, that he turned from it and came home. Sometime after, looking out, he ſaw this ſame young woman carried dead on a board: She had been cruelly whip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped to death; neither did he obſerve that this pitious ſpectacle drew the concern or hardly attention of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.</p>
                  <p>A third inſtance happened in <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> in the preſence of a perſon now reſiding there. A veſſel had taken in a number of ſlaves, on the coaſt of Guinea, amongſt theſe was a man, who probably

from the dignity of his ſituation in his own country, or from ſome other cauſe, did not ſhew ſuch ſubmiſſion as the ſhip's people expected and require of ſlaves. They attempted to tie him with ropes, but that not anſwering their purpoſe, they confined him in irons, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe ſo tormented him during their paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from <hi>Guinea,</hi> in order to bring down his ſpirit, that when they arrived at <hi>Charles-Town,</hi> he was in ſo weak a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as to be ſcarce able to walk to the place of ſale, but as he was urged on with the whip. When the ſlaves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned in the evening, this man remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing unſold, was forced along with the reſt towards the veſſel, he walked on for a while, till he came to the market-place, where he fell; but the whip being exerciſed upon him, he roſe, and going on a little farther dropt down dead. The relater, a perſon of credit, ſaw the tranſaction, and exclaimed againſt the barbarity; but no notice was taken, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther judicially or otherwiſe; he was dragged along and flung into the ſea, to be devoured by the ſharks.</p>
                  <p>The laſt inſtance I ſhall mention, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in <hi>Carolina,</hi> on board a veſſel with ſlaves from <hi>Guinea,</hi> related by a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon lately in this city from thence. It
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:013145_0136_0F8EC1126799B200"/>
ſeems the poor negroes had let in a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaſion, from a fire appearing on the ſhore, that the white people propoſed to put them to death; this made them unwilling to leave the ſhip: However they were all made to comply except one man, who had taken ſo ſtrong hold of ſome part of the ſhip, that the ſailors were not able to looſe him. This raiſed the anger of the captain to ſo great a degree, that he ſtruck the poor fellow ſo hard a blow, with ſomething like an handſpike, as broke both his arms, whereby the captain looking upon the fellow as diſabled and unfit for ſale, gave him another blow on the head, which cauſed his brains to fly about the veſſel.</p>
                  <p>"We know, ſays a late reſpectable author, that the negroes (employed in our plantations) are purchaſed from their princes in <hi>Guinea,</hi> who pretend to have a right to diſpoſe of them, and that they are like other commodities, tranſported by the merchants, who have bought them into <hi>America,</hi> in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to be expoſed to ſale. If this trade admits of a moral or a rational juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, every crime, even the moſt atro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, may be juſtified. Government

was inſtituted for the good of mankind; kings, princes, governors, are not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors of thoſe who are ſubject to their authority; they have not a right to make them miſerable. On the contrary, their authority is veſted in them, that they may, by the juſt exerciſe of it, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the happineſs of their people. Of courſe they have not a right to diſpoſe of their liberty, and to ſell them for ſlaves. Beſides, no man has a right to acquire or to purchaſe them: Men and their liberty are not either ſileable or purchaſeable.—No one, therefore, has any but himſelf to blame, in caſe he ſhall find himſelf deprived of a man, whom he thought he had, by buying for a price, made his own; for he dealt in a trade which was illicit, and was prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited by the moſt obvious dictates of humanity. For theſe reaſons, every one of thoſe unfortunate men, who are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to be ſlaves, has a right to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared to be free, for he never loſt his liberty; he could not loſe it; his prince had no power to diſpoſe of him. Of courſe the ſale was <hi>ipſo jure</hi> void. This right he carries about with him, and is entitled every where to get declared. As ſoon, therefore, as he comes into a country in which the judges are not for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getful
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:013145_0137_0F8EC113464D3860"/>
of their own humanity, it is their duty to remember that he is a man, and to declare him to be free. I know it has been ſaid, that queſtions concerning the ſtate of perſons ought to be determined by the law of the country to which they belong; and that, therefore, one who would be declared to be a ſlave in <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica,</hi> ought, in caſe he ſhould happen to be imported into <hi>Britain,</hi> to be adjudged according to the law of <hi>America</hi> to be a ſlave; a doctrine, than which nothing can be more barbarous. Ought the judges of any country, out of reſpect to the law of another, to ſhew no reſpect to their kind and to humanity. Out of reſpect to a law, which is in no ſort ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligatory upon them, ought they to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regard the law of nature, which is obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory on all men at all times, and in all places: Are any laws ſo binding as the eternal laws of juſtice? It is doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, whether a judge ought to pay great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er regard to them, than to thoſe arbitra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry and inhuman uſages which prevail in a diſtant land? Aye, but our colonies would be ruined, if ſlavery was aboliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Be it ſo; would it not from thence follow, that the bulk of mankind ought to be abuſed, that our pockets may be filled with money, or our mouths with
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:013145_0137_0F8EC113464D3860"/>
delicacies? The purſes of highwaymen would be empty in caſe robberies were totally aboliſhed; but have men a right to acquire money by going out to the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way? Have men a right to acquire it by rendering their fellow creatures miſera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble? Is it lawful to abuſe mankind, that the avarice, the vanity, or the paſſion of a few may be gratified? No! There is ſuch a thing as juſtice, to which the moſt ſacred regard is due. It ought to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>violably obſerved. Have not theſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy men a better right to their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and to their happineſs, than our <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican</hi> merchants have to the profits which they make by torturing their kind? Let therefore our colonies be ruined, but let us not render ſo many men miſerables. Would not any of us, who ſhould—be ſnatched by pirates from his native land, think himſelf cruelly abuſed, and at all times intiled to be free. Have not theſe unfortunate <hi>Africans,</hi> who meet with the ſame cruel fate, the ſame right? Are not they men as well as we, and have they not the ſame ſenſibility?"</p>
                  <p>"But it is falſe, that either we, or our colonies would be ruined by the aboli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſlavery. It might oecaſion a ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of buſineſs for a ſhort time. Every great alteration produces that effect: Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe

mankind cannot on a ſudden, find ways of diſpoſing of themſelves and of their affairs: But it would produce many happy effects. It is the ſlavery which is permitted in <hi>America</hi> that has hindered it from becoming ſo populous, as it would otherwiſe have done. Let the negroes free, and in a few generations, this vaſt and fertile continent, would be crowded with inhabitants; learning, arts, and every thing would flouriſh amongſt them: Inſtead of being inhabited by wild beaſts, and by ſavages, it would be peopled by philoſophers, and by men." <hi>Prins. law of Scott.</hi>

                  <p>"He who detains another by force in ſlavery, is always bound to prove his title. The ſlave ſold or carried into a diſtant country, muſt not be obliged to prove a negative, that <hi>he never forfeited his liberty.</hi> The violent poſſeſſor muſt in all caſes ſhew his title, eſpecially where the old proprietor is well known. In this caſe, each man is the original proprietor of his own liberty.

                  <p>"Long and ſerious reflections upon the nature and conſequences of ſlavery have
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:013145_0138_0F8EC113F2DEB098"/>
convinced me, that it is a violation both of juſtice and religion; that it is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the ſafety of the community in which it prevails; that is it deſtructive to the growth of arts and ſciences; and laſtly, that it produces a numerous and very fatal train of vices, both in the ſlave, and in his maſter.—Freedom is unqueſtionably the birth right of all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; <hi>Africans</hi> as well as <hi>Europeans:</hi> to keep the former in a ſtate of ſlavery, is a conſtant violation of that right, and therefore alſo of juſtice.—The <hi>Britiſh</hi> merchants obtains the negroes form <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica,</hi> by violence, artifice, and treachery, with a few trinkets to prompt thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate people, to enſlave one another, by force or ſtratagem. Purchaſe them, indeed they may, under the authority of an act of the <hi>Britiſh parliament.</hi> An act entailing upon the <hi>Africans</hi> (with whom we were not at war, and over whom a <hi>Britiſh parliament</hi> could not of right aſſume even a ſhadow of authority) the dreadful curſe of perpetual ſlavery, upon them and their children forever. <hi>There cannot be in nature, there is not in all hiſtory, an inſtance in which every right of men is more flagrantly violated."

                  <head>EXTRACT of a Sermon preached by the Biſhop of Glouceſter, before the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety for the Propagation of the Goſpel at their anniverſary meeting, on the 21ſt of <hi>February,</hi> 1766.</head>
                  <p>FROM the free-ſavages I now come (the laſt point I propoſe to conſider) to the ſavages in bonds. By theſe I mean the vaſt multitudes yearly ſtolen from the oppoſite continent, and ſacrificed by the coloniſts to their great idol, the GOD OF GAIN. But what then, ſay theſe ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere worſhippers of <hi>Mammon,</hi> they are our own property, which we offer up. Gracious God! to talk (as in herds of cattle) of property in rational creatures! creatures endowed with all our faculties, poſſeſſing all our qualities but that of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour; our brethren both by nature and grace, ſhocks all the feelings of humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and the dictates of common ſenſe. But, alas! what is there in the infinite abuſes of ſociety which does not ſhock them? Yet nothing is more certain in itſelf, and apparent to all, than that the infamous traffic for ſlaves directly infringes both divine and human law. <hi>Nature created man free,; and grace invites him to aſſert his freedom.</hi> In excuſe of
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:013145_0139_0F8EC1150A94FFE8"/>
this violation, it hath been pretended, that though indeed theſe miſerable out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſts of humanity be torn from their homes and native country by fraud and violence, yet they thereby become the happier, and their condition the more eligible. But who are YOU, who pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to judge of another man's happineſs? That ſtate, which each man, under the guidance of his maker, forms for himſelf; and not one man for another. To know what conſtitutes mine or your happineſs, is the ſole prerogative of him who created us, and caſt us in ſo various and differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent moulds. Did your ſlaves ever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to you of their unhappineſs amidſt their native woods and deſarts? Or, rather, let me aſk, did they ever ceaſe complaining of their condition under you their lordly maſters? Where they ſee, indeed, the accommodations of civil life, but ſee them all paſs to others, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, unbenefited by them. Be ſo gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious then, ye petty tyrants over hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man freedom, to let your ſlaves judge for themſelves, what it is which makes their own happineſs. And then ſee whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they do not place it in the return to their own country, rather than in the contemplation of your grandeur, of which
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:013145_0140_0F8EC1157551FE70"/>
their miſery makes ſo large a part. A return ſo paſſionately longed for, that deſpairing of happineſs here, that is, of eſcaping the chains of their cruel taſk maſters they conſole themſelves with feigning it to be the gracious reward of heaven in their future ſtate; which I do not find their haughty maſters have as yet concerned themſelves to invade. The leſs hardy indeed wait for this felicity till overwearied nature ſets them free; but the more reſolved have recourſe even to ſelf-violence, to force a ſpeedier paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage.</p>
                  <p>But it will be ſtill urged, that though what is called human happineſs be of ſo fantaſtic a nature, that each man's im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agination creates it for himſelf, yet hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man miſery is more ſubſtantial and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form throughout all the tribes of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Now, from the worſt of human miſeries, the ſavage <hi>Africans</hi> by theſe forced emigrations, are intirely ſecured, ſuch as the being perpetually hunted down like beaſts of prey or profit, by their more ſavage and powerful neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours—In truth, a bleſſed change!— from being hunted to being caught.

                  <head>Pure and Spiritual Worſhip: A SERMON. <hi>Preached at</hi> DEVONSHIRE-HOUSE, <hi>November</hi> 12, 1690.</head>
                  <byline>BY STEPHEN CRISP.</byline>
                  <p>THE Worſhip of God, of the Great God, is pure: he is a Holy God, <hi>Of Purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity;</hi> and they who will worſhip God, whoſe Souls are breathing to have a Return of a Teſtimony in his Sight, muſt offer up pure Worſhip, and it muſt come from that which is pure: For that purpoſe the Greatneſs of the Love of God is made manifeſt in Chriſt Jeſus; and there is a diffuſing of his Grace and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue in the Hearts of the Sons and Daughters of Men, whereby he hath laid a Foundation for his own Worſhip; becauſe his Worſhip muſt be pure. Therefore he hath freely
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013145_0142_0F8EC11B04B5BBF8"/>
given unto us, through his Son, the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that pure Principle of Life and Grace, from whence and out of which, all true Worſhip doth ſpring, and all true Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to God ariſeth, and real Obedience to his holy Will ſprings forth out of that which is from himſelf.</p>
                  <p>And therefore all that will be Worſhippers of God aright, muſt firſt know and be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible wherein the Ability and Capacity ſtands, that may enable them to ſo great and ſo good a Work. Some have conceived it to ſtand in their own Will, and according to the Working of their own Will, they have framed Worſhips, Religions, and Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, thinking thereby to pleaſe God: But you know the Apoſtle in a few ſhort Words lays down a poſitive Chriſtian Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, <hi>Without Faith it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now this doth declare and ſignify, that there muſt be ſomething upon which this Faith muſt work, that muſt be the Object and Foundation of it: Faith as it worketh in the Creature, worketh upon ſomething; it lays hold upon ſomething in which there is a Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of pleaſing God. Now if <hi>we are all by Nature Children of Wrath,</hi> and that no one of himſelf can pleaſe God, then there muſt be ſomething that is ſupernatural that muſt be the object of that Faith, by which Men
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013145_0142_0F8EC11B04B5BBF8"/>
alone can pleaſe God; and this muſt be made manifeſt to the Creature for its Help, for to be its Director and Supporter in that Work, that is too mighty for himſelf, too great a Work for a Man or Woman, too deep, too profound for any Man's Abilities, Power, Wiſdom, and Acquirements, that he can at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to in this World, to worſhip God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right: To worſhip God, that is, to perform a pure Worſhip to a pure God; <hi>Who can bring a clean Thing out of an unclean?</hi> Now if we are all obliged to bring a clean Worſhip, a pure Worſhip to a pure and Holy God, who hath created us and all Things; where ſhall we have it? Not out of an unclean Heart, not out Of a defiled Mind; there is no bringing it forth from thence, for that is the State and Condition that Men are fallen into by Sin, in which their Minds and Conſciences are defiled, their Hearts are pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luted, and their Affections depraved and ſet upon wrong Objects; and in this State none can ſerve God aright: That which is pure and holy muſt be firſt made known, revealed, diſcovered and believed before Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple can perform a right Worſhip to God.</p>
                  <p>And therefore in vain it is, to go and drive People to this and that Worſhip, and force People to this and that Service and Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, upon the Account of the Worſhip of God. This is vain Worſhip; when they
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013145_0143_0F8EC11B68A78438"/>
have done all, it is not acceptable to God; the poor Creature hath no return from the the Lord, for God accepts no Service or Worſhip, but only thro' his Son. And if ſo be, Men cannot pray and preach in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of his Son, and cannot preſent their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and Supplications to God, but by the Aſſiſtance and Help of his bleſſed Spirit, there is no Reaſon in Religion why People ſhould expect a Return and Anſwer from God of the Prayers they make: For it is the general Doctrine of <hi>Chriſtendom,</hi> That Chriſt Jeſus is appointed of God for a Mediator between God and Man, and all the Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance we have, or deſire to have, muſt be through him: and therefore if we pray without him, and perform this and the other Duties without him; it is contrary to the Doctrine of Chriſtianity to think that ever we ſhould have Acceptance in God's Sight.</p>
                  <p>Therefore there is a Neceſſity for every Man and Woman that deſires to be religious, that hath a religious Mind, and is willing to worſhip God, and ſerve God aright, there is a Neceſſity that they come to the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Chriſt, who tells us that he is <hi>The Way to the Father:</hi> They that go any other Way go a wrong Way: but they that go unto God by Chriſt, they do receive from him Power to draw near to God; and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013145_0143_0F8EC11B68A78438"/>
through him they receive from God all thoſe Bleſſings that their Souls ſtand in need of.</p>
                  <p>So here would be an End of all Religions the World is full of, of all the ſeveral Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips that Men have made: They have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and found out ſeveral Ways for Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to worſhip and ſerve God; This and the other Ceremony, this and the other Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Method of Preaching and Praying: If all this be without the Aſſiſtance and Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Help of the Mediator, thro' whom a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone we can juſtly expect Acceptance at God's Hands, it is all good for nothing. Therefore the firſt Leſſon of a Chriſtian in Point of Worſhip, is that he come to the Knowledge of Chriſt, by whom, and thro' whom he may expect Favour with God.</p>
                  <p>Now ſay ſome People, We are already come to the Knowledge of Chriſt, we have read the Relation in the Goſpel of his Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, Birth, Life and Death, Reſurrecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Aſcenſion: Now whether this Belief doth give a Man this Kind of Chriſtian Knowledge, that doth open a Door and Way for him into the Preſence of God: This is a Queſtion that ought ſeriouſly to be conſidered, for if we err in this Queſtion, we err in all; this is like ſtumbling at the Threſhold, and never come into the Houſe. If we miſtake in laying hold of Chriſt, we
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013145_0144_0F8EC11C382181C0"/>
miſtake in our Worſhip, and in all Matters that relate to Life and Salvation.</p>
                  <p>For if we muſt have another Sort of Knowledge of Chriſt than we can have from the Reports of others; if I muſt have Chriſt revealed in me before I can have the Hope of Glory; if I muſt have the Spirit of Chriſt in me, to help me to put up my Requeſts and Supplications before he can preſent them to the Father, then all literal Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and Faith cannot ſtand Men in any Stead, but this is evident by the Teſtimony of all the Writers of the New Teſtament. Chriſt and his Apoſtles did concurrently ſignify, that the Hope of a Chriſtian, that the Power and Strength of a Chriſtian, it all lies in this, in that they had known the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation of Chriſt, and the powerful Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Spirit working in them; this was that which was well pleaſing to God; ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Scriptures might be ſpoken of, but you know the Scriptures, and can read them, and ſee in them the concurrent Teſtimony of all Holy Men to this Day, that the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge they had of Chriſt was a divine Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, a ſpiritual Knowledge, it was know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him after the Spirit, it was a Revelation of Chriſt in them, that ſeparated and diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed them from Reprobates, even the Knowledge of God thro' Jeſus Chriſt their Lord: Why ſhould not we come to this
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013145_0144_0F8EC11C382181C0"/>
Knowledge as well as they? The Lord is the ſame, and his Power is the ſame and his <hi>Arm is not ſhortened:</hi> We may ſee as much Need of divine Aſſiſtance, and divine Love as e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Men did; we can perform no Duty, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of Prayer or Preaching, without divine Aſſiſtance; not ſo much as a Sigh or Groan, that may have Acceptance with God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Help of his Spirit, <hi>Rom.</hi> viii. 26. <hi>The Spirit helpeth our Infirmities, for we know not what we ſhould pray for as we ought, but the Spirit itſelf maketh Interceſſion for us with Groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings which cannot he uttered.</hi> If we go about the Duty of Prayer without divine Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, we ſee what ſad Work we make of it; if we pray not in the Spirit and with the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, how can we receive the Thing we pray for? But if we <hi>Pray in the Spirit, and with the underſtanding alſo,</hi> then the <hi>Spirit helps our Infirmities;</hi> the Spirit that came from God brings us the Things we ſtand in Need of.</p>
                  <p>So that a Chriſtian hath a Foundation for his Worſhip and Chriſtian Performance; what is that Foundation? Nothing that is corrupt, if it be, it is good for nothing; for nothing that is corrupted and that defiles, can be acceptable and pleaſing to God; we are all polluted and defiled by Nature; how can carnal Men worſhip a Spiritual God? Carnal Men that are in Death and Darkneſs,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013145_0145_0F8EC11CF4FB9D28"/>
cannot worſhip that God that is Light, and dwels in Light, that is inacceſſible, that is <hi>of purer Eyes than to behold Iniquity.</hi> Carnal Men want a Foundation for their Worſhip, and will do till they come to that Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that God hath laid.</p>
                  <p>Now, that I may ſpeak intelligibly what the Lord hath laid upon my Heart, I would ſay thus; There is an univerſal Benefit and Privilege diſtributed and given freely of God, unto the Sons and Daughters of Men, in their natural State, through his Son Jeſus Chriſt, in that he hath cauſed his Light to ſhine, and his Grace to be extended to eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man; <hi>for the Grace of God</hi> which bringeth Salvation (for it is not by Works) <hi>hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared unto all Men,</hi> and bringeth Light, by which every Man may ſee how to worſhip God; God hath enlightened every Man, and this Light comes by Chriſt the Mediator; this Mediator is the Way that Men muſt walk in, if they will come back again to God; for Men are run out and departed from God; if Men will draw near to God, and take ſome Footſteps towards the Kingdom of God, from the Kingdom of Sin and Satan, they muſt mind the Way, the Way muſt be their Director, they muſt not go which Way they liſt.</p>
                  <p>This is that which was propheſied of Chriſt, ſaith God by the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah, I

will give him for a Leader.</hi> I would fain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God, and go out of the Kingdom of Sin and Satan, to the Kingdom of God: God hath given Chriſt to lead me, if I knew that Way he would lead me in, I would go that Way. As ſoon as a Man takes hold of Chriſt, his Grace, and Spirit, and Life, he will be ready to ſay, I am corrupt, my Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes are corrupt, my Mind is depraved, my Conſcience defiled and polluted; but I have found out ſomething or that God hath beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon me, that is Eſſential, Holy and Pure, that did never conſent to my Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, but is a Witneſs for God againſt it: Here now a Chriſtian lays hold on Chriſt, the Leader; which Way will he lead me? If thou layeſt hold of this Guide, he will lead thee out of Evil, he will teach thee to ceaſe to do Evil, and ſpeak Evil: This Light will lead thee to Nothing that will diſhonour God, or defile thy own Soul: But this is not all, we muſt not only ceaſe to do Evil, but we muſt be doing ſomething; there muſt be a breaking off from Pride, <hi>Fooliſh Jeſting, Evil Communication;</hi> but this is not all that he will lead me to; let us learn that Leſſon, <hi>Ceaſe to do Evil.</hi> This Doctrine was preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before Chriſtianity was preached, as it is now preached; the Prophets of old preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this Doctrine to the <hi>Jews</hi> that were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der an outward Adminiſtration, <hi>Ceaſe to do
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:013145_0146_0F8EC11DD212DC90"/>
Evil, and learn to do well,</hi> then I will plead with you, and diſcourſe with you, ſaith the Lord: <hi>Come now let us reaſon together, ſaith the Lord, though your Sins be as Scarlet, they ſhall be as white as Snow; though they be red like Crimſon, they ſhall be as Wool.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This is the firſt Leſſon that a true Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an learns in his turning to God, in his Change and Tranſlation, <hi>to ceaſe from that which is Evil:</hi> Here is a Ceſſation of Rebel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lion, and her is ſome hopes of being recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciled to God; a Man hath beer a Rebel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt his Maker, but he hath now received help to reſiſt thoſe Temptations that prevail over him: But there is no worſhipping yet, there is a forward mind in Men to do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is pleaſing to God; but there are ſome that are not troubled at all for their Evil Ways, and dread not God's Anger, but make a mock at Sin, that draws others to it, and make themſelves merry in it: But there is a ſort ſo far touched with a divine Senſe of God's Love to them, that they have alſo a Senſe of his Anger and Indignation, becauſe of their Sin; and they would fain be out of his Anger; and who can blame them? When a Man feels the Anger of God burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a Fire in his Boſom, who can blame that Man if he deſire Peace with God? If he be under a Senſe of the Diſpleaſure and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation of the Almighty, he muſt not

haſte too ſoon out of that Condition he is brought into; for this is God's Purpoſe, and this is the Fruit of all his Troubles and Afflictions, to take away Sin: God had no other End or Deſign in the Affliction that came upon him, than to take away Sin; when God hath brought a People into a diſtreſſed and dejected State for their Sin, the Fruit that God expects, is the <hi>taking away of their Sin,</hi> and he will hide Pride from them, and humble them before him; if this be the Purpoſe of God that he intends to purge and purify his People; then ſaith the poor Creature, if God deſign to purify me from Sin, then I will pray to God to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port me, and bear me up under his Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: That is the Cry of the Soul that he may not be brought too ſoon from under the Judgment of God, but he may be ſupported and hid in the Hollow of God's Hand, until the Time of Remiſſion and Refreſhing comes, that he may behold the Light of God's Countenance.</p>
                  <p>Here is Encouragement for every one that is acquainted with this divine Principle of Grace, that will be led by it, and follow it ſo far as to be led out of Evil; then they will be fitted to do ſomething in the Work of God; every Sigh and Groan that thou haſt the Aſſiſtance of the Spirit of God to help thee in, is Part of Worſhip: All thy

Brokenneſs of Heart is part of Worſhip; hereby thou acknowledgeſt the great God, that he is able to help thee on in thy Way, and to pardon thy Iniquity, and blot out thy Tranſgreſſion, and give thee all thoſe heavenly Bleſſings that thy Soul doth ſtand in Need of: Then thy Soul will bow down to God in Acts of holy Worſhip, and ſay, with an humble Confidence and Expectation, God will do all theſe things in me, and for me, that will promote my Salvation. It is nothing in Religion for People to go from Praying and Preaching to Sinning; but God muſt have a holy Sacrifice, and that muſt come out of a pure Heart: Now when a Man is brought by the Help of God, and by the divine Aſſiſtance of the Mediator, Jeſus Chriſt, to break off from his Sin, then he ſtands fair to become a Child of God, and to be a Servant of God, and to do ſomething for God in his Generation, and to offer to God Praiſe and Thankſgiving, and to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form all other Duties that God ſhall lead him into.</p>
                  <p>But ſome will ſay, What, muſt we do a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny thing? I have deeply weighed that Queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, what a poor Man or Woman muſt do, that is come out of Bondage? There is a Propenſity in People to be doing, they would fain do ſomething, they would be doing; they ſay, What ſhall I do? If I do
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013145_0147_0F8EC11E6B263038"/>
ſomething that pleaſes not God, I had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter let it alone; and I can do nothing ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to God without divine Aſſiſtance: Such an one that ſees his own Impotency and Inability will caſt his Care upon God, and will ſay, The Lord is able to lead me and guide me: I am ready to do thy Will, O God: Make it clear to me that this is thy Will, and that this is that which thou re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quireſt, I am ready to do it, tho' it be croſs to mine own Will: He is ready to go on in God's Way, in the Way of Chriſtianity; ſuch an one that hath the true Knowledge of Chriſt, if he ſpeaks, the Spirit of Chriſt ſpeaks in him; if he prays, it is through the Aſſiſtance of the Spirit of Chriſt, through whom God alone is appeaſed and reconciled, and through whom they may receive a Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from God's Hands: But for Men to run on in their own Wills, and to do a thing becauſe they will do it, they had better ſit ſtill; this doing in their own Wills, hath filled the World with a Sort of Chriſtians that want Acceptance with God, which is to be had alone through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and the Want of the Guidance of God's Holy Spirit, is the Miſery and Downfal of Chriſtianity in our Days.</p>
                  <p>Therefore it is our Work and Buſineſs to build upon that Foundation which God hath laid; no Worſhip is pleaſing to God,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:013145_0148_0F8EC11F37A8F278"/>
but that which ariſeth from that Spring that is pure and Holy: If I cannot find that which will keep me from all pollution and defilement, if I cannot find that, I muſt ſtay till I can; for to begin a Worſhip and a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion without that which I know is accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to God, it is but loſt Labour, and Time ſpent in vain.</p>
                  <p>Therefore, Friends, let every one that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires to be religious, turn their Mind inward, wait for the Gift of God, which is eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly pure, that never did conſent to Evil, that never mixed with the Corruption of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but bears witneſs to the Light, that will guide you and lead you, and conduct you, firſt out of Sin, and then it will lead you into that Worſhip and Religion, and the Performance of thoſe Things that are pleaſing to God. They that are come to this Worſhip, they do not only know what the Lord requires of them, and when he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it of them, but they are given up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hands of God; they pray, preach, exhort and live according to the Will of God.</p>
                  <p>It is hard for People in a carnal State to believe this; but you that are Believers, that are come to know the Gift of God in your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and the Neceſſity of being ruled by him; you will believe us, for none elſe will believe us; let us preach to as many People
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013145_0148_0F8EC11F37A8F278"/>
and Nations us we will, none will receive us as true Miniſters, but thoſe that have the Truth in their own Hearts; if there be any that deſpiſeth the Grace of God in his own Heart, he hates that which chides and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proves him; if there be ſuch a Man, he will hate me becauſe I am a Miniſter and a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Grace of God, and of that Truth in the inward Parts, which is the Ground and Foundation that Man hath of Accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with God. A wicked carnal Wretch will ſay, I hate ſuch an one, I hate the Light, that which checks me, and witneſſeth a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, thou art ſuch an one as beareſt Witneſs againſt me, therefore I hate thee: It is very true, it cannot be otherwiſe: Now our Deſire and Labour is, that Men may come to the Love of the Truth in themſelves.</p>
                  <p>You know there are a great many other Miniſters, whoſe Labours are to perſwade People to believe what they ſay: to lay down a Doctrine, and prove it by Scripture and Reaſon, and ſet it home upon their Minds by ſuch Teſtimony as the Scripture affords, and hereupon they prevail upon the Minds and Judgments of People, to believe what they lay down.</p>
                  <p>It is eaſy to lay down a Poſition and prove it, and convince People that it muſt be according to Scripture; but when a Perſon is convinced of a Principle
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:013145_0149_0F8EC12011CA0BF0"/>
of Truth, he is not Regenerate thereby and come to God; therefore, though he cannot deny the Doctrine of Truth in Words, yet he can deny it in Works, and doth not rightly come to love it. If People would believe what we ſay, and obſerve what Argument we bring for proving a Poſition, they may be convinced of the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Truth, and come to a Profeſſion of it, and yet be Strangers to it, till they come to love it in themſelves; if it were not for this, we would leave Preaching, if God had not given a Meaſure and Manifeſtation of the Spirit to every Man to profit withal: You have it in yourſelves, we are but as Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitors to you, to put you in Mind of it; you have ſo much Buſineſs in the World, that you have not had leiſure to take Notice of it.</p>
                  <p>A Man may have a rich Jewel, and be poor notwithſtanding, till he comes to know the Value of it. A Man hath a rich and precious Jewel, a Pearl beſtowed upon him that would make him rich in Faith and Love to God, and qualify him for the Kingdom of God, and make him an Heir of it, but he knows not, nor underſtands the Value of it, and eſteems it not; therefore God hath raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up Miniſters to put you in mind of it, that you may be happy forever, and live in Bleſſedneſs to all Eternity; <hi>Whoever hath an Ear to hear, let him hear;</hi> and when they
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:013145_0149_0F8EC12011CA0BF0"/>
hear what we ſay, let them take the Benefit of it to their own Souls. We bring not Truth to you, but God hath beſtowed it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on you; you will be rich indeed, if you do as a Man that bought a Field where the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Pearl was, and digged till he found it. Come to the Foundation upon which you ſhould build all your Hopes of Happineſs, and depend not upon your own Works, or religious Performances, for Acceptance with God; for there is no Acceptance with God, but only through Chriſt, we are only ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of God through him: Thoſe that will become Chriſtians indeed, and worſhip God as he hath ordained and appointed himſelf to be worſhipped; they muſt come to the Principle of Light and Grace in their own Hearts, which they have in, and thro' Chriſt, and they will find Acceptance with God.</p>

                  <p>YOU have read and heard much con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Day of the Lord, as a great and notable Day; many of you are
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:013145_0150_0F8EC123F9D67520"/>
now living Witneſſes that the great, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Day of the Lord is coming, in which the accompliſhment of great and nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Things, the mighty Works of God, which have been propheſied of, may be law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully expected. It is the Work of every Chriſtian to wait upon the Lord in the Light of this Day, and to be acquainted with the Works of the Lord, both inwardly and out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly; for the Day of the Lord is a Day of Power, and that Power of God worketh wonderful Things; and if we were not kept in the Light of that Day, the Lord may work great things, and we not know it; we ſhall be looked upon as careleſs and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent Witneſſes of the Works of the Lord, as thoſe that do not regard them. If you would be faithful Witneſſes, you muſt have regard to the Works of the Lord, and the Operation of his Hands. One that is mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a faithful Witneſs, he will take Notice of what is ſaid and done; you are called to be Witneſſes of the Works of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and of his Doings; you muſt ſtand where you may hear, and ſee, and underſtand what the Lord is about to do at this Time.</p>
                  <p>In your Teſtimony and Witneſs bearing, the greateſt Thing we have to expect in this Day of the Lord is, that God will ſet up the Kingdom of his Son Chriſt Jeſus; and unto
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:013145_0150_0F8EC123F9D67520"/>
this all the Prophets did bear witneſs in their Time, and now it is our Turn to bear wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it by ſenſible and living Experiences of the Accompliſhment of thoſe Things that they propheſied of, that the Lord will ſet up the Kingdom of Chriſt, and bring down and lay waſte the Kingdom of Antichriſt. This our Saviour taught his Diſciples to pray for, ſixteen hundred years ago, that the Kingdom of God might come; and all the true Diſciples of Chriſt ever ſince have pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the coming of this Kingdom, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them have ſeen the coming of it, and rejoiced; and others have died in the Faith of it, and have been gathered into the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven.</p>
                  <p>But, my Friends, that which chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns us at this Day, is to behold the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, the eternal Son of God, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, to go forward and proſper; and the Kingdom of Antichriſt ſuppreſſed and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, and utterly laid waſte; and this is wrought two Ways, 1. Inwardly. 2. Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, Inwardly, There is a greater Incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation in the Minds of People, to look more at the Operation of God's Power in this great Work outwardly, than to look at it inwardly, but unto that there muſt be a daily Croſs taken up, and it is my Buſineſs at this Time to tell you in the Name of the
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:013145_0151_0F8EC124F9D6ABD0"/>
Lord, that your Duty and mine is to turn our Minds to the Working of the Power of God in ourſelves, and to ſee that other Kingdom of the Man of Sin weakened and brought down within us; then there is no Fear but he will carry on his Work outward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, and we ſhall ſee as much of that Work as belongs to our Generation; but the great Matter and chief Concernment of you and me, is to ſee the Kingdom of God ſet up within us, which ſtands in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs: Our Buſineſs is to walk till we ſee the Righteouſneſs of this Kingdom ſet up within us in our Hearts and Souls, and to have a real change made.</p>
                  <p>We all know, and we muſt confeſs, that wre have been ſubject to the Man of Sin, whatſoever we are now. We have ſeen the Reign and Government, the Rage and Ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny of the Wicked One that hath led us into Rebellion and Diſobedience to the Lord our Maker; how do we like that Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to be ruled by the Devil, and to be led Captive, and to be made to do his Will, and to rebel againſt God that gave us our Life, and our Breath, and our Being? How do we like that Government of Satan? I hope we do none of us like it. It was ſo with me, and they that are under the tyrannical Government of Satan, have many Cries and Wiſhes in their Souls that they were freed
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:013145_0151_0F8EC124F9D6ABD0"/>
and delivered from it, and brought under the Government and Obedience of Chriſt Jeſus: and they were able to ſerve God as they ought to do, that they might be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated from the Kingdom of Sin and Satan, into the Kingdom of the bleſſed and dearly beloved Sen of God.</p>
                  <p>This hath been the Cry of ſome ever ſince they have known the World; and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded it is the Cry of many at this Day: I have good news to bring you; not that the Day of your Redemption draws nigh, but that it is come; the Day of Redemption is now come, and there are a great many bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing and glorifying the Name of God that they are redeemed, and delivered from the Bondage of Corruption, and have more Joy and Delight in the Service of God, that made them, than ever they had in the Service of the God of this World.</p>
                  <p>But may not ſome ſay, How ſhall this great Work be wrought; for it is a great Work, and we verily think that nothing but an Almighty Power can effect it? For there are many in this Aſſembly have been trying to no Purpoſe, and done what they could in their own Strength<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to deliver their own Souls from Death, and yet they find themſelves in Bondage ſtill; nay, they have called in the Help and Aſſiſtance of thoſe that they thought to be ſtronger than themſelves,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:013145_0152_0F8EC12539374EF0"/>
and all have failed, and they are yet weak and entangled, and they cannot find them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at Liberty to ſerve the Lord as they ought to do.</p>
                  <p>I am of this Mind, that nothing but the Almighty Power of God can do it; and when you come to my Experience, to know this as I have done, then I hope you will ſeek after that, and you will ſee good Reaſon for it; and you will then come to this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, If the Lord puts not forth his Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power, I muſt then periſh, for there is no other Power can deliver me: When you come to know this, what muſt you do? Why, you muſt wait for the Revelation of that Power that will take you off from all Truſt and Confidence that you have ever had in any Thing elſe; a Man that hath no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to truſt to but the Almighty Power, and Mercy, and Goodneſs of God, he puts his whole Truſt and Confidence therein, or elſe he knows he muſt periſh.</p>
                  <p>When a Man or Woman comes to this paſs, that they have nothing to rely upon but the Lord, then they will meet together to wait upon the Lord: And this was the firſt Ground or Motive of our ſetting up Meetings; and I would to God that this was the uſe that every one would make of them that come to them, then they would be juſtly and properly uſed according to the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:013145_0152_0F8EC12539374EF0"/>
End of the Inſtitution of them at firſt; we ſhould uſe them as poor deſolate helpleſs People that are broken off from all their own Confidence and Truſt, and have nothing to rely upon but the Mercy and Goodneſs of God; and if he pleaſeth to reveal his Power among us, we know that he is able to ſave us; and we have met with the Revelation of God's Power; and when we have met to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in Simplicity of Mind, the Lord was pleaſed to communicate his Spirit to us, and open a Door for us, and diſcover and reveal to us that it was the Day of his Power: And when we came to examine ourſelves, whether we were willing in this Day of God's Power (for the Prophet gives us a Note of Diſtinction between the People of God, and other People; <hi>Thy People ſhall be willing in the Day of thy Power,</hi> which is as much as to ſay, God diſcovers and reveals his Power to them, ſuch a People are willing to give themſelves over to the Government of it, when we found we were ſubject to it) we had Joy in believing, before we attained the End of our Hope; it was Gladneſs to us we found ourſelves willing; and I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that every one of you would be glad to find yourſelves willing to part with that which you cry out of.</p>
                  <p>What a Cry is there of our Bondage and Corruption, and of our being led Captive by
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:013145_0153_0F8EC125ED22F650"/>
our Luſts? We may hear ſuch a Cry from one End of the Kingdom to the other: Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple cry out of the Bondage of Corruption, and of their Subjection to Sin and Satan: I would they were in earneſt; there is not that Earneſtneſs and Reality in Men and Women that God looks for, and ſo there comes nothing of it. There is no Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and no Deliverance, the Lord doth not hear them, though they come now a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>days into his Preſence, to offer up their Prayers: I would have you to be in good earneſt, I wiſh well to you all; and it would be hard to ſay that you do not wiſh well to yourſelves: Here lies your Welfare, that you find yourſelves willing to be ſubject to the Power that made you; you have been ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject doubtleſs to the Power that deſtroyed you; that Power that never gave you Life and Breath, hath been inſtrumental of your Deſtruction: The Power of the God of this World never did Men good, but deſtroyed them, deceived them, and deprived them of their Lives.</p>
                  <p>Now if there was but a Willingneſs in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very one of us, freely to give up ourſelves to that Power that created us to obey his Will: I am ſure there is never a Man or Woman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us ſhall long be without the knowledge of it. If I am but willing to be ſubject to the Law of him that made me, it will not be long before he diſcover it to me, and reveal his
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:013145_0153_0F8EC125ED22F650"/>
Power in me in the Glory and Excellency of it; that Power which is more able to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve me than all the Power of Men on Earth, or all the Power of the Devils in Hell is able to deſtroy me. When the Lord ſhall diſcover and reveal his Power in you, you will be willing to be ſubject to it.</p>
                  <p>But methinks the Sound and Noiſe of Fleſh and Blood grows loud here: I would be ſubject to God, but I would not have him croſs mine intereſt, and deprive me of that I love and thirſt after: I would not have him imbitter my carnal Delights and Pleaſures, and undo me as to my Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the World.</p>
                  <p>You may ſee whence this comes, that you would make a Bargain, and draw a Contract with the God of your Lives about theſe Things, this is a nonſenſical Thing; becauſe of all People in the World, you are a People that have had a Veneration for the Holy Scriptures, the Scriptures of Truth, and have been acquainted with them ſo familiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as with any Book in the World, wherein you find Articles drawn, long ago fixed and ſealed; and no new ones are to be drawn. If any one will be my Diſciple, <hi>John</hi> or <hi>Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas, James</hi> or <hi>Peter,</hi> or whoſoever he be, he muſt take up his Daily-Croſs, and deny himſelf, and follow me. Now here is a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract made, therefore turn aſide from all
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:013145_0154_0F8EBA95EEE23280"/>
Kind of Reaſoning and Conſulting with Fleſh and Blood.</p>
                  <p>If you will become ſpiritual, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of ſpiritual Bleſſings and Benefits, I would adviſe you to turn from all Kind of Reaſonings that come from the Bit of Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, that hath thus far deceived you, and will ruin you for ever, if you hearken to them: For aſſure yourſelves new Goſpel-Terms no Man can make; and if any come to preach new Goſpel-Terms, count him a Deceiver; for there is no poſſibility of being a Diſciple of Chriſt, but by taking up a Croſs daily, and denying ourſelves, and follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him as our Leader and Guide. To him I muſt go, and go in no other Way, ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nothing, or doing nothing but what is holy and pure; he muſt conduct me in my Walking, guide me in my Way, and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify me in it: This is to be a true Diſciple of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as he comes to adhere, and join to the Power of God revealed in his Soul, he ſees the coming of the Kingdom of God, he ſees it at a Diſtance, he ſaith within himſelf, and makes this Concluſion, I will follow my Captain, I will become ſubject to the Kingdom of Chriſt. If I obey this divine Principle of the Grace of God, and the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of Chriſt, I ſhall be his Diſciple. I read in his bleſſed Book, <hi>That as many as are led by
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:013145_0154_0F8EBA95EEE23280"/>
the Spirit of God, are the Children of God.</hi> I am not to propoſe new Terms, but accept of the old Terms of the Goſpel of Chriſt: I ſee that the Kingdom of God is to be ſet up, and the Kingdom of the Devil to be brought down in me; if I follow this divine Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, I ſhould never follow the Devil more; if he would have me lye, I ſhall refuſe, and ſay I cannot; if he would have me run into vain and corrupt Communication, and fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh Jeſting, that will be a Bridle to me, that I cannot do it.</p>
                  <p>I ſpeak now to Perſons that live under the Light of the Goſpel of Chriſt, and that are ſubdued by his Grace; I would ſpeak that which all the Logick in the World cannot overthrow, that which the moſt cun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Logicjan, with all his Wit and Quirks, cannot refute and prove erronious. If a Man be led by the Spirit of God, he cannot lye; this is a common Cure for all Men; if I be led by the Spirit of Truth, and hearken to the Principle of Truth in my own Soul; this will cure and heal me of the Wounds and Maladies of my corrupt Nature, and ſet me at Liberty from my old Maſter; I do not like his Service.</p>
                  <p>I hope if any of you like the Servitude and Bondage of Sin and Satan, you will deſire Liberty before you die: Why do not you deſire it now? It may be thou thinkeſt
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:013145_0155_0F8EC126B11CEBF8"/>
to enjoy a little Liberty and Reputation, and Pleaſure in Sin for many Years, for Six or Seven, Nine or Ten Years, and then break off from it, and repent and turn to God: How doſt thou know that thou haſt Ten Days to live? It is of high Concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to every one of us to wait for a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of Goſpel-Liberty, and an Ability and Power in his Soul, to enable him to break off from the Servitude and Bondage of Sin and Satan, that he hath ſo long lived under; and to wait upon God with Patience for the ſetting his Soul at Liberty, and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up the Kingdom of Chriſt within him, and pulling down the Kingdom of Satan, that he may be brought into the Kingdom of Chriſt, that conſiſts in <hi>Peace and Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs and Joy in the Holy Ghoſt.</hi> Theſe are the Things that follow one another; when Righteouſneſs is ſet up in me, I ſhall not be diſturbed, I ſhall have Peace; and if I have Peace I ſhall have joy, and this joy is in the Holy Ghoſt the Apoſtle ſaith the Kingdom of God conſiſts in theſe Things.</p>
                  <p>Now that every one might be perſwaded that God hath given a Meaſure of his Grace to them, as well as to other Folks: Let them conſider and ſay within themſelves, God hath not ſhut me out of the Number of his People: He hath knocked at the Door of my Heart, to bring me to Repentance, he hath
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:013145_0155_0F8EC126B11CEBF8"/>
waited upon me ſo long, ſurely he hath a Mind to ſave me: Would he call upon me, but that he intends I ſhould repent and turn to him?</p>
                  <p>But where is the Power? You will ſay knocking at the Door of the Heart, and Checks of Conſcience, we underſtand them; but we underſtand not where the Power is, to be comformable to the Will of God.</p>
                  <p>People will never underſtand it while they are in the Kingdom of Satan, and under the Power of the Prince of Darkneſs; the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle tells us, <hi>That the God of this World hath blinded the Minds of them that believe not leſt the Light of the Glorious Goſpel of Chriſt, who is the Image of God, ſhould ſhine upon them.</hi> If Men ſaw the Beauty of the Goſpel, they would run after it, and embrace it; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Devil blinds their Minds, that they ſhould not ſee the Beauty and Amiableneſs of the Goſpel, and like the Terms of it: He hath the Rule and Government of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Diſobedience. So long as I live in Subjection to that deviliſh helliſh Power, which leads me forth into Sin: I ſhall be a Stranger to God's Power, that would enable me to break off from it.</p>
                  <p>You never read in Scripture of any that ever came to be ſaved by the Power of God, but there was Faith mixed with it, that came to join with that Power of God, Our Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iour
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:013145_0156_0F8EC1278F569ED8"/>
ſaid to the impotent Man, <hi>Thy Faith hath made the whole;</hi> thy Faith joining with that Power of God. <hi>We ſhall be made ſtrong in the Lord, and in the Power of his Might,</hi> and be able to withſtand Temptations.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the Soul of Man joins with the Grace of God, he doth forſake the Service of his old Maſter and Governor, Sin ſhall no longer have Dominion over him; though he may meet with the ſame Temptation, it ſhall not have the ſame Power over him, but he will be enabled, by the Grace of God to withſtand it, and overcome it. If you aſk ſuch a Man, how it is that he over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes that Temptation that formerly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed over him; he will tell you, I have now an Helper, I am now joined to the Grace of God in my Soul, therefore do I withſtand Temptations, and have Power over them. Thus comes the Kingdom of Chriſt to be ſet up in the Soul, and this is that which will fit and prepare us for the everlaſting King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of God: They that do wait upon God, ſhall ſee this Work wrought inwardly in them, they know more by Faith than they can ſee by Senſe.</p>
                  <p>I know and am certain, that the Power the Devil hath in the World, ſhall be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down, and Righteouſneſs ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, and Juſtice and Equity ſhall prevail in the Nations. I ſhall not perhaps live to
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:013145_0156_0F8EC1278F569ED8"/>
ſee it, but I may ſee it by Faith; I have ſeen enough for my Generation, and they that live in the next Generation ſhall ſee it alſo; for the Church of God is the ſame from one Generation to another. Now unto us it is given to ſee the Things that in former Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations were propheſied of, God having (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>provided ſome better Thing for us, that they without us, ſhall not be made perfect.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Church of God from one Generation to another, have their Meaſure and Degree of Service, and bear their proper Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, and leave the reſt to ſucceeding Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: It concerns us in our Generation to ſee a Change made inwardly in our Souls, and the Kingdom of Chriſt ſet up within us, and the Kingdom of Satan brought down in ourſelves. This doth not concern my Son or Grandſon only, but it concerns me, and when they grow up to mature Age, in their Time it will concern them. Therefore that which is moſt profitable to us, is, that we have ſuch a Station, and ſtand in ſuch a Place in our Time, where we may ſee the Work of God carried on.</p>
                  <p>I have conſidered many a Time, that there are many brave Men and Women in this Age, that might have been eminent Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes of God in this World, and borne their Teſtimony to his Truth, but their Faith
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:013145_0157_0F8EC128457070D8"/>
hath been weak and ineffectual: They have diſcovered their unbelieving Hearts, and have joined with the common Herd of the World, becauſe they thought ſuch great Things could never be done, that the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Satan could never be pulled down and deſtroyed, and the Kingdom of Chriſt ſet up within us. But I would hope better Things of you, Things that accompany Salvation and that he that hath begun a good Work in you will carry it on to Perfection; that living Praiſes and joyful Thankſgivings may be rendered to him who alone worthy, who is God over all, bleſſed for ever; to whom be Glory and Dominion for ever and ever. <hi>Amen.</hi>

Glory that is ſpeakable, that appears many Times through Inſtruments, will not ſatisfy them; there is ſomething beyond that, which muſt ſatisfy; this will never do it: People will never be ſatisfied with hearing, nor never ſatisfied with ſeeing, till they come to hear and ſee <hi>that which is unutterable,</hi> and then they are ſatisfied; Chriſt had preached many Sermons in the hearing of his Diſciples, and there were a great many ſaid, <hi>That there was never any Man ſpake like him,</hi> preached like him; yet one of them that was neareſt to him, and moſt acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and intimate with him, after ſome Years meeting and hearing of his Sermons, he cries out <hi>Shew us the Father, and it ſufficeth us.</hi>

                  <p>My Friends, this comes near to many of your States; many of you have heard long, and have heard the ſpeakable Word of God, that which could be uttered, that which could be ſpoken forth, by the Demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Holy Ghoſt, by them <hi>that have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Father;</hi> this you have heard long, and yet there are many of you, that if you come to a ſerious Search, you will find a Want, you will find ſtill that you have not that Satisfaction that puts you beyond Doubt, beyond Fear; there is ſomething that ſtands in the Way, that hinders your Enjoyment of the unſpeakable Glory of the unſpeakable Word, and this will never be

removed, but by your innocent ſubmitting to the Work of the Power of God in your own Hearts, that ſo you may not only be Believers, but come to be really baptized, and then all is out of doubt; for our Lord ſaid, <hi>he that believeth and is baptized ſhall be ſaved;</hi> he doth not ſay, He may be ſaved, but, He ſhall be ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Woful Experience hath told us in our Days, That a great many have believed the Truth, and yet they are never like to be ſaved, they <hi>have made Shipwreck of their Faith;</hi> but if they had been baptized, if they would have endured the Baptiſm, if they would have been buried with Chriſt in Baptiſm, they ſhould have been ſaved every one of them; and now there are a great many that remain in the Belief of the Truth and yet they are not baptized, they are not dead, not buried, notwithſtanding <hi>they have received like precious Faith with us,</hi> that <hi>Faith which is of the Ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God,</hi> and that <hi>is like precious</hi> in its Nature to all that do receive it, and would work the ſame Effect in all too, if it were not obſtructed; but notwithſtanding they have received Faith towards the ſaving of their Souls, yet their Souls are Captives, their Souls are ſubject to Luſts, and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and Vanities, and unto empty and fooliſh Things, and to Paſſions and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, after they have received Faith.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="38" facs="unknown:013145_0159_0F8EC129AA0BAFE8"/>For if you take one that is a Believer of Truth, that is overtaken with his Luſt, and Paſſions, and Corruptions, he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly own that he believeth the contrary, he believeth that theſe Things ſhould not be, that it ought to be otherwiſe: This is the Signification of Truth againſt Untruth: If it ſhould be otherwiſe, why is it thus then? Why, he finds a Life to ſpring up in that which is corruptible, that is always contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to the Life of God, and at Enmity with it: What ſhall I do? I believe the Truth, I know it is an holy Thing, it leads all that ſubmits to it to an holy Life, and there is this and that unholy Thing, this and that corrupt Thing remains, what ſhall I do?</p>
                  <p>It is an evident Demonſtration that thou wanteſt the Baptiſm of him in <hi>whom thou be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieveſt;</hi> thou haſt believed in Chriſt Jeſus that cometh after <hi>John,</hi> and was before him; and now having believed in him, thou wanteſt to be baptized by him, and for want of that, the Pollution and Corruption that was grown up in thy Nature, in the Time of thy Alienation prevails ſtill upon thee, contrary to thy Faith; and there is no coming to obtain this Baptiſm, but by ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down into that which will ſlay thee, that which will kill thee: But there is ſuch a ſhifting to ſave ones Life, there are ſo many Twiſtings and Twinings of People to ſave
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:013145_0159_0F8EC129AA0BAFE8"/>
their Lives, that at laſt they loſe them; but there are none that could ever find that Life that is eternal, but thoſe that are willing to be given up to the Dead, and ſubmit to this Baptiſm, that is, by the Holy Ghoſt and by Fire: Theſe only do come to Life, they come to the Reſurrection, for you never knew a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that died this Death but they roſe again; it is as impoſſible for Death to hold any one down that is buried in this Baptiſm, as it was impoſſible to hold Chriſt down, when he was in the Grave; <hi>The ſame Power that brought again our Lord Chriſt from the Dead, the ſame Power it is that quickens us,</hi> while we remain in theſe mortal Bodies, after we have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained this Death and Crucifiction.</p>
                  <p>But who can believe this ſaying? for <hi>this is a hard Saying, who can bear it?</hi> Is it not e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough that I am a Believer, which makes me a Friend, and entitles me to a Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty among you, and as long as I hold the Truth, and profeſs the Truth, I am looked upon as one of your Society? This is very true, this doth entitle People unto the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Privileges of the Church of Chriſt; but there is another inner Court, that lies under the Angel's Reed, the Meaſuring-Reed, that is to be meaſured, the Temple is meaſured, and every Worſhipper in the Temple is meaſured; there was an outward Court, that was for repreſenting the Church
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:013145_0160_0F8EC12AAC902078"/>
of God in general, from the particular; the outward Court was not meaſured, that the Gentiles might come in; the unbaptized People, which were never regenerated, they might come ſo far as the outward Court, but this did not entitle them to the Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of the Houſe of God, nor to any Worſhip or Sacrifice that was accepted up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on God's Altar.</p>
                  <p>It concerns you and me (my Friends) to be ſerious about Matters of this Moment and Importance, and not ſpend your Days, and, as it were ſpeak by rote, under an airy Profeſſion, though of Truth itſelf, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out conſidering what Progreſs you have made, what Benefit you have obtained, and whether you are come not only to <hi>the Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow of good Things to come,</hi> but to the very Subſtance of the heavenly Things; <hi>for the Comers to the outward Worſhip, could never with thoſe Sacrifices they offered be made perfect; the Comers thereunto were not made perfect as to the Things pertaining to the Conſcience,</hi> ſpeaking there of the outward Worſhip, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.1. but coming to the heavenly Things, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of the other were but a Shadow, they made People perfect, as to the Conſcience, and did bring them to Salvation. The Apoſtle alludes to this Baptiſm, for he ſpeaks in a Figure of the <hi>Eight Perſons that were ſaved in</hi> Noah's <hi>Ark;</hi> then he brings down the
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:013145_0160_0F8EC12AAC902078"/>
Allegory to Chriſtian Baptiſm, not only the Baptiſm of <hi>John,</hi> the Fore-runner of Chriſt, that preached of Chriſt, but to the Chriſtian Baptiſm itſelf; <hi>By the like Figure whereof Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm now ſaveth us,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>not the putting away of the Filth of the Fleſh, but the Anſwer of a good Conſcience.</hi> What doth he mean by Baptiſm ſaving us? He means, <hi>the Anſwer of a good Conſcience towards God, through the Reſurrection of Chriſt from the Dead;</hi> ſo that Chriſtian Baptiſm did bring along with it the <hi>cleanſing and putting away of all Sin out of the Conſcience,</hi> that might bring them under Doubts and Scruples; and then there is an ariſing of Jeſus, the Saviour in the Conſcience, the Mediator that brought them to anſwer for them in the Sight of God; for if People be conſcious of Sin; and do leave off their Sin, this doth not yet cleanſe the Conſcience; for there ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains a Conſcience of Sin: 'tis not the leaving off our Sin that makes our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonement with God, or that expiates our Guilt, or doth away the Guilt of the Sins that we have committed; but there muſt be a Forſaking and a Leaving off Sin by the Virtue and Power of the Spirit, by which we are enabled, not only to leave off Sin, but are guided and directed to the Mediator, <hi>whoſe Blood alone reconcileth us to God, and cleanſeth us from all Sin.</hi> If I ſhould never
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:013145_0161_0F8EC12B2B74C180"/>
commit a Sin while I live, it is not this ſimply in itſelf that will make me have the Anſwer of a good Conſcience in the Sight of God; for there remains the Guilt of Sin contracted in the Days of Unbelief, which is a Bar and Hindrance that none can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach the Holy God but in the Attonement and Salvation that comes by Jeſus Chriſt; for all that believe and obey the Goſpel are accepted in Chriſt, and upon the Account of Chriſt's precious Blood, that cleanſeth us from all Sin and Unrighteouſneſs. Whom doth it cleanſe? Thoſe only that forſake their Sins, and by his Power are brought to a holy Life; they by the Virtue of his Power, and the Cleanſing of his Blood, come to have their former Sins removed from them, as far as the Eaſt is from the Weſt.</p>
                  <p>But what is this to them that remain in their Sins? what is this <hi>to them that are not baptized? for the Dead that have not put off the old Man, nor put on the new Man,</hi> but have only put on the Name and Profeſſion of Chriſt, and put on the outſide of him, his Garment, but have not put him on, they are not <hi>created again in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> unto <hi>good Works, that they might walk in them?</hi> No wonder there remains a Conſcience of Sin in them, there is a Bar that hinders them from the Sight of the Glory of God, and from real and true Satisfaction, concerning their
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:013145_0161_0F8EC12B2B74C180"/>
Attonement and Reconciliation with God, and this hinders them from the Enjoyment of <hi>that Peace that paſſeth underſtanding;</hi> and it is no Wonder, becauſe they are not come to this Baptiſm that brings the <hi>Anſwer of a good Conſcience in the Sight of God;</hi> they are not riſen with Chriſt; how ſhould they? for they are not buried with him, <hi>Rom.</hi> vi. 3. <hi>Know ye not that ſo many of us</hi> (ſaith the Apoſtle) <hi>as were baptiſed into Chriſt, were baptiſed into his Death; therefore we are buried with him by Baptiſm into Death; that like as Chriſt was raiſed from the Dead by the Glory of the Father, even ſo we alſo ſhould walk in newneſs of Life;</hi> here is a Change figured out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them that had partaken of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Baptiſm, and were come again to the Participation of Life in the Reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt and thoſe that were not bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tized.</p>
                  <p>So it is now with every one that cometh to believe the Truth, and make a Profeſſion of it: there is a Way caſt up, and there is a Door opened for Salvation; but the grand Queſtion that every one ought to enquire a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout, and put to themſelves, is, What Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs they have made this Way? Whether they are baptized yet or no? Whether they have <hi>put off the old Man with his Deeds, and put on the new Man and the new Man's Deeds, which are Righteouſneſs and Holineſs?</hi> They
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:013145_0162_0F8EC12EDDECE380"/>
that find that, though they are Believers, they are ſhort of this, they do alſo find that their Shortneſs is their Hindrance, their Shortneſs in not coming up to the Pattern that hath been ſhewed them, is their Hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance, ſo that they enjoy not the things here ſpoken of the being under this Senſe, and really ſitting under this Senſe in a Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though there ſhould be no Man ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to them outwardly, yet being come to this Faith, and made Partakers of this Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, People would find in their own Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoms the hidden Word of Life miniſtring to their Condition; they would have enough, there would not be a Famine of the Word unto them, nor they ſhould not need to be in Expectation of going out to this or the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Inſtrument, but they would be ſatisfied when they are met together with the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of the Lord, that the Lord is in the midſt of them, miniſtring them the Word of Life, in his Operating and Working, ſpeaking in a Tongue that every one can underſtand it, ſpeaking with a kind of Voice and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, that every one may underſtand his own State and Condition; and this is the Way that God brought up People from the Beginning, to the Knowledge of Heavenly Things, and opening of the Myſteries of Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation; we had it not of Men, but of Jeſus our Lord; he was our great Miniſter, we
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:013145_0162_0F8EC12EDDECE380"/>
waited upon him, and truſted in him, and he taught us himſelf; he hath miniſtred to us at our ſilent and quiet Waiting upon him thoſe Things that were convenient for us; we might well ſay, <hi>He gave us our Food in due Seaſon;</hi> he hath not only given <hi>ſtrong Meat unto Men,</hi> but hath miniſtred of the <hi>ſincere Milk of his Word unto Babes,</hi> that lived in Sincerity and Self-denial, loving God a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all things; and he taught and conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us in our Way, this Way of Simplicity, until our Underſtandings came to be open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, until our Souls came to be prepared to receive the Myſteries of his Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>In thoſe Days there were ſome that ſtarted up in Knowledge, and that <hi>built their Neſts on high, and took Flax and Wool, and Silver and Gold, and decked themſelves with them;</hi> but the Lord found them out, and brought them down, and took the Crown from their Head, and cloathed them with Diſhonour: So God doth from Age to Age, his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will begin at his own Houſe if you would <hi>Grow in the Grace and in the Knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> then grow in Humility and Self-denial, and keep a conſtant watch upon your Hearts; exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine your Hearts, and <hi>Commune with your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves upon your Beds, and be ſtill;</hi> take Heed leſt you ſin againſt the Lord, and provoke him; <hi>There were ſome that provoked the Lord

of old, and they committed two great Evils, What be they? They have gone away and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken the Fountain of living Water;</hi> as much as to ſay, they have not the Dependance upon an inviſible Power, as they ought to have; for I am a living Fountain, and 'tis by an inviſible Power that I am able to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and teach, direct, and purify and open their Underſtanding; but they have forſaken me, that is one great Evil; and the other is, they would not be without ſome what, <hi>they have forſaken the Lord,</hi> and they would have ſomewhat inſtead of God: <hi>They have digged to themſelves broken Ciſterns, that will hold no Water.</hi> And how many in this Age have committed theſe two great Evils?</p>
                  <p>My Friends, examine yourſelves; are there not many that have been guilty of theſe two great Evils? They do not keep their cloſe Dependance, Truſt and Reliance upon the inviſible Power of God, as they profeſs they ought to do, but are hurried away from it; ſome by the Love of the World, ſome by Luſts and Pleaſures, ſome by Paſſions, and others by worldly Intereſts, are drawn away from the Power, to do and ſay that which the Power is againſt: Is not this a Forſaking of the Lord, the living Fountain? What do they do then? Are they not for this and that, and the other Man? for hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this and the other Man's Word, and

                     <hi>digging to themſelves broken Ciſterns?</hi> And have they not their Truſt and Confidence in go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Meetings, in commending this and the other Way? Have they not their truſt in their Profeſſion outwardly, when it mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters nothing to their Souls, ſo that they ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly wither for all this? If you had all the Men and Angels that were ever ſent of God, appointed to preach to you, that could not miniſter Life to you, unleſs there be that Faith that ſtands in the Power of God. The Faith that ſtands in any Man's Words, that will not overcome your Luſts: but the Faith that ſtands in the Power <hi>purifies the Heart,</hi> it will not ſuffer any unclean thing there. As for Preaching, let a Man preach againſt this and the other Luſt and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, there it will remain for all his Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, unleſs Men know God's Power and Life in which there is Righteouſneſs; for Words and Knowledge, and Sight and Spe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culation, will never give People Victory o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their Sins.</p>
                  <p>Therefore you know, every one who is ſettled muſt be ſettled where the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Religion is; it is not coming to Meetings, and owning this and the other Doctrine which is the Foundation of our Religion; God hath revealed his Power to every one of us; God hath not given his Spirit to Preachers and Prophets only, for
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:013145_0164_0F8EC12FE9E05A28"/>
then there would be a <hi>Famine of the Word,</hi> as was in <hi>Iſrael, The Prieſt's Lips preſerved Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge.</hi> If you did take away the Prieſt, you did take away their Knowledge. The Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets had the Word of God, and they only ſpake the Word of God. If the Prophet was taken away, then the Word of God was taken away. The Lord threatened to ſend a Famine among them, they grieved and vexed, and killed and deſtroyed the Prieſts and Prophets; therefore ſaith the Lord, <hi>I will ſend a Famine among you, not of Bread, but of the Word, and they ſhall go from City to City, and enquire for the Word of the Lord.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus it was in the Jewiſh Church; if there was a Prophet they would go 30, 40, or 100 Miles to him that had the Word of the Lord; <hi>They ſhall go from City to City to enquire for the Word of the Lord:</hi> but bleſſed be God we are come to another Day, for now the Word of the Lord is manifeſted in the Hearts of all that believe; they know the Word: I do not ſay all that believe do preach the Word, or ought to preach; but the Word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth to them; they are not as <hi>broken Ciſterns that can hold no Water;</hi> when they find the Word and hear it, they ſpeak it preſently what is miniſtred to their own Condition, that they tell to other Folks; when People come to the Bleſſing of this Diſpenſation that God's Word revealeth in their Hearts,
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:013145_0164_0F8EC12FE9E05A28"/>
they then know what the Signification of it is, they underſtand the Doctrine of it, the Doctrine preacheth Holineſs to them, not that they ſhould preach Holineſs and yet remain Unholy; not that they ſhould preach Humility, and yet remain Proud: It preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Holineſs, Humility and Singleneſs of Heart to a Remnant, that like good Scholars and Diſciples learn the Leſſons and Doctrine of the Word of God.</p>
                  <p>Now when thou haſt learned them well, and art come to ſee the Effect of the Word, and doſt bring forth the Deeds and Works which are the Fruits of Holineſs, <hi>Perfecting Holineſs in the Fear of God, and with Humility known and witneſſed in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> and art not only meek in Shew, but <hi>meek and low in Heart;</hi> when People come to be meek and lowly, and of a clear Conſcience, <hi>purged from all dead Works to ſerve the living God;</hi> then if the Lord gives them a Word of Exhortation, of Doctrine or Counſel it is very welcome, and it hath a Savour through the Bleſſing of God, and they come by it to be <hi>built up in their moſt holy Faith,</hi> and this Word is brought forth in Holineſs and Righteouſneſs in their Lives, and ſhews itſelf in a Life of Holineſs; then thou wilt ſhine in thy Converſation to all that thou converſeſt with, ſo that they may ſee thee to be ſuch a Man or Woman as haſt been with Jeſus, and learned of Jeſus,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:013145_0165_0F8EC13067B730C8"/>
and receivedſt <hi>a Word engrafted;</hi> when thou doſt receive the Word into thy Heart, there is the Engrafting of it: If it hath not Root there, then, ſaith Chriſt, <hi>My Word doth not abide in you.</hi> If you feel ſomething of this inviſible Word in your Hearts, it brings you to a Reſolution to ſerve God, and to keep yourſelves from Sin, and to anſwer the Profeſſion which you make of God; this is the Effect of the Word of God, if it doth abide in you. Doth it abide? You ſhall know anon or To-morrow, ſo ſoon as a Temptation comes to ſtir you up to Pride or Paſſion, to Fraud or Deceit, then you will ſee whether the Word abide: If it abide, you ſin not.</p>
                  <p>This is Scripture, a certain Foundation Doctrine, that may be as ſafely preached as any Doctrine: If the Word abide in you, you ſin not; What of that? Let the Word go, and you will ſin, whenever you are tempted to it. <hi>I write to you young Men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe you have overcome the wicked One, you are ſtrong and the Word of God abides in you, and you have overcome the wicked One.</hi> We ſhall ſee as ſoon as Temptation meets with thee, whether the Word abides in thee; if it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bide, thou wilt not Sin, but reſiſt the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Set thy foot upon the Temptation, and go over it, and thou wilt have the Domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and this will make thee a free Man or
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:013145_0165_0F8EC13067B730C8"/>
Woman, and thou wilt <hi>ſtand faſt in the Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty wherewith Chriſt hath made thee free.</hi> The Apoſtle ſuppoſeth them free, and that they have got Dominion; then <hi>Stand faſt,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in the Liberty wherewith Chriſt hath made thee free.</hi> It is a Liberty not of Luſt and Sin, but a Liberty of the Soul; the Soul now is not at the Devil's Will and Call.</p>
                  <p>For it is a Shame to the Doctrine of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, that we profeſs Things, and yet deny them in Practice: We profeſs that there is a Power in Chriſt to keep and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve us out of Sin, and we profeſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that this Power is communicated to them that do believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt for their Preſervation; that is, he will not with-hold it from them: We profeſs theſe Things in the Face of the whole World; and yet when the Devil calls one Man to Covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and another to defraud his Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and another to defile himſelf, he is drawn away thereby; what Hypocriſy is here, to profeſs this, and act the contrary? I do not wonder that they who profeſs they cannot live a Day without Sin, that they ſhould fall; but they that profeſs to believe there is Power enough in Chriſt, and that it is offered to them; for them to live in Sin and yield to Temptation, this is horrid Wickedneſs. They that are of an upright ſingle Mind, would die before they would
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:013145_0166_0F8EC13121FAD270"/>
ſin, knowing that God is Almighty and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and willing to beſtow his Power and Wiſdom, and Grace upon them that aſk it; they would die rather than ſin againſt God preſumptuouſly: Let it coſt me my Goods, my Eſtate, my Liberty, or my Life, <hi>How can I do this great Wickedneſs, and Sin againſt God?</hi> They love God above all; you never heard them complain that they wanted Power, <hi>For the Lord is at their right Hand, and they ſhall not be moved.</hi> They cannot fall; though they are tempted, they will not fall into Temptation. They have Power when they ſee the Devil before them, to put him behind them; the Nobility of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, of their new Birth and Regeneration puts ſuch a Temper and Diſpoſition into their Souls, that they ſcorn to be at the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil's Command, as if they were his Child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren.</p>
                  <p>Oh! it is a noble and honourable thing to be a Child of God, a very high Dignity to be in ſuch an honourable Relation to God, and to have a Right to the heavenly Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, <hi>To ſit down in heavenly Places in Chriſt Jeſus.</hi> I would to God you were all ready for it, that you had the Wedding Garment on, that you might not be <hi>bound Hand and Foot, and caſt into utter Darkneſs.</hi> What is the Reaſon that you do not ſit down in this heavenly Frame and Temper, and draw the

Waters of Salvation out of your own Souls: Could the Lord do any Thing more than he hath done, and could his Servants do any more than they have done for your Help? Are not their Labours Demonſtrations of it? We have been <hi>as Epiſtles of Chriſt written in your Conſciences:</hi> We have been teſtifying that there is ſomething wanting in too many the Want of reſigning up themſelves to the Baptiſm of the Croſs. People are willing to be counted Friends; but they are Friends of God, <hi>that do whatſoever he commandeth them;</hi> that is the Chriſtian Leſſon, not to ſay I will be a Friend to you, and a Friend to the Church, and to ſuch a Sort of Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; but I will be a Friend to God, and do whatſoever he commanded me; whatſoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Command God lays upon you, either to take up a Croſs, or to deny yourſelves and follow him.</p>
                  <p>Learn this Leſſon, and you will be Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples indeed, and Members of the Church too; not members of a Church privileged outwardly only, <hi>but Members of a Church of the Firſt-born, and you will have your Names written in Heaven;</hi> when one comes to have his Name written in Heaven, he comes to know his Name, 'tis a <hi>white Stone,</hi> not a ſpeckled one; they that have it, they know it, they are not ignorant of one another's Names that are written in this Book; they

You that are at a Diſtance now, you muſt come nearer to him; God will chuſe a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple by whom his Name ſhall be magnified; becauſe <hi>the Love of God is ſhed abroad in our Hearts,</hi> we cannot but deſire this for all, <hi>eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially for the Houſhold of Faith;</hi> we cannot but deſire their Perfection, their growing up in the Grace of God, that they might come to be Partakers of Heaven.

                  <p>We talk of a Bulwark as well as others; we have a Bulwark, bleſſed be the God of Heaven, made of better Stuff than theirs; for it is the Salvation of God which hath kept us from the Pollution of Sin, and from a running <hi>into all Exceſs and Riot</hi> that others have run into; it hath kept us from the Evil, it hath kept Evils out of us, and we have found that certainly true, That <hi>all Things work together for Good, to them that love God, and fear God;</hi> that all the Providences of God together, they have all wrought for our Good; and this is the Bulwark that we have truſted in, and it hath ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed hitherto, and it will ſerve us and our Poſterity to the End of the World.

                  <p>Many wonder we differ with them in ſome Opinions; we have that Confidence in this Bulwark, that we deſire not another; God will laſt and abide for ever, ſo will this Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wark; all the Care that I take, and all the Care that you ſhould take, is to keep with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in theſe Walls: Do not ſally out, if you go out, the Devil is watching, and <hi>ſeeking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinually whom he may devour;</hi> he will catch ſtraglers; if that People will go out for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit, or for Pleaſure, or Intereſt, the Devil will catch them: What, ſuch People talk of Salvation for Walls and Bulwarks? the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil hath got them in his Snare, and they are caught in Drunkenneſs, Uncleanneſs and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sins; the Reaſon is, they have gone out of their Bulwark, they have ſallied out of their Walls, for the Devil could never have fetched them out.</p>

                  <p>I remember a notable Saying of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle, which hath a great Emphaſis in it, and a great Deal of Doctrine, he writeth to the Church after they were become a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of Profeſſing Chriſtians, <hi>Take heed leſt you come to be beguiled by the Serpent, as he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiled Eve;</hi> he did not ſpeak of <hi>Jezabel,</hi> a wicked Woman; but he ſpoke of <hi>Eve,</hi> a good Woman <hi>created after the Image of God, in Righteouſneſs and Holineſs:</hi> They were come to a Life of Sanctification, to a Life <hi>that was hidden from Ages and Generations;</hi> You muſt look to yourſelves, and look upon yourſelves as in the State of your Mother <hi>Eve,</hi> a Woman brought forth in Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Holineſs, that might have ſtood in that Primitive State, notwithſtanding all the Subtilty of all the Serpents in the World;

but letting her Ear hearken to this Old Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, ſhe was beguiled; there grew up a Conſultation in her reaſoning Part; it may be ſo as he ſaith, I will try.</p>
                  <p>So I ſay to you that are come to a State of Sanctification, and in ſome meaſure to know the cleanſing Power of God, and that you have not believed in it in vain, but it hath effectually wrought ſome Change and Alteration in you, and is ſtill carrying on the Work of your Salvation: Many Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations will attend you, and many Snares will be laid in your Way, but God hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved you to this Day: I know the Devil's Wiles and Temptations are manifold; they are fitted to every one's Inclinations, fitted to every Opportunity, and to every Occaſion in this World; Men are tryed every Way by the Tempter, to ſee which Way he may enſnare them; he tries every Way to <hi>enſnare</hi> and entangle <hi>the ſimple,</hi> that he may turn them to the right hand or to the left, that their Souls may be deſtroyed and periſh.</p>
                  <p>I cannot ſpeak to you by a more empha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Word, by a more familiar Exhortation than this, <hi>Take heed you be not beguiled as Eve was:</hi> many will be tempted as ſhe was; but I would not have you do as ſhe did, and yield to the Temptation: Take heed that you do not defile yourſelves, but <hi>keep your Garments white;</hi> you that have been waſhed
