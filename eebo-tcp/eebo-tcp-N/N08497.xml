            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>Virginia,</hi> To a Merchant in <hi>Philadelphia.</hi>
            </head>
            <opener>
               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>"I Have read, with much Attention, your Apology for the Merchants of Philadelphia; and think you have great Merit, in at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to vindicate a Conduct, which is deemed inexplicably ſpiritleſs by the Inhabitants of every other Colony.</p>
            <p>"One would imagine there has been ſomething very myſterious in the Behaviour of the Merchants of Boſton, to have induced you to treat them with ſo much Contempt; if their Conduct, ſince the firſt Diſpute with our Mother-Country, had not been man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, candid and ingenuous.</p>
            <p>"You confeſs, that many of you oppoſed the <hi>Suſpenſion</hi> in Conſequence of Advice received from your <hi>particular Friends</hi> in <hi>London,</hi> that prudent and pacific Meaſures would be moſt a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>able to the Miniſtry and Parliament; and that it was dangerous to provoke them. This, no doubt, influenced ſome among you—But, in my Opinion, we muſt look ſomewhere elſe for the real Cauſe of your Oppoſition: perhaps an Examination into the Nature and Deſign of the Stamp-Act, and the grevious one, to which you ſtill bend the Knee, may diſcover the lurking Principle, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>on which you acted.</p>
            <p>"The Stamp-Act was intended to raiſe a Revenue in America: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Produce of the ſeveral Duties were ordered to be paid into the Receipt of his Majeſty's Exchequer, and there reſerved, to be, from Time to Time, diſpoſed of by Parliament, towards defending, protecting, and ſecuring the American Colonies and Plantations.—This Act, in your Reſolutions for Suſpending the Importation of Goods from Great-Britain, you, without Ceremony, declared to be UNCONSTITUTIONAL; you likewiſe entered into ſpirited Meaſures for obtaining a Repeal of it, which had an immediate and a deſired Effect.—You obſerved, juſtly, that the Stamp-Act was <hi>unconſtitutional</hi> —altho your Reaſons, for believing it to be ſo, were not then explained. Your Opinion muſt have been founded upon this obvious Truth, That no Power on Earth had a Right to take Money out of your Pockets without your Conſent, expreſsly declared by yourſelves or your choſen Repreſentatives.—Not content with barely remonſtrating againſt the Stamp-Act.—You alſo inſiſted "That the many Difficulties you then laboured under, as a trading People, were owing to the Reſtrictions, Prohibitions, and ill-adviſed Regulations made in the ſeveral <hi>other</hi> Acts of the Parliament of Great-Britain, late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly paſſed to regulate the Colonies; which had encreaſed the Coſt and Expence of many Articles of your Importation, and cut off from you all Means of ſupplying yourſelves with Specie enough to pay the Duties impoſed on you, much leſs, to ſerve as a Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of your Trade."</p>
            <p>"The Acts, againſt which, you ſpoke thus freely—ſtill remain in full Force and Virtue; and when you obtained a Repeal of the Stamp-Act, glorious as it was—you obtained but a Part of your Demand.—The Repeal of it was well worth the Pains and Trouble it coſt you.—It was indeed ſo replete with miniſterial Venom, and proved ſuch a general and oppreſſive Burthen, that Judges, Lawyers, Phyſicians, Parſons, Merchants, Farmers, nay Shool-Boys and Orphans, were alike ſubject to its baneful Influence.</p>
            <p>"The Sufferings of all Ranks of People induced <hi>them</hi> to oppoſe it—Buſineſs was conſequently at a Stand.—The civil Courts were ſhut, and you could ſue no Man for the Recovery of a Debt—You were therefore <hi>obliged</hi> to ſacrifice a very conſiderable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt; and you determined to import no Goods from Great-Britain, until it was repealed.—This was <hi>your</hi> Virtue! —This <hi>your</hi> Reſolution!—Your <hi>Patriotiſm</hi> and <hi>private Intereſts</hi> were ſo intimately connected, that you could not proſtitute the one, without endangering the other: And you would have been particularly fortunate, if Great-Britain, when ſhe repealed the Stamp-Act, and redreſſed all your Grievances; and had never thought of impoſing new ones— You would, <hi>then,</hi> have been diſtinguiſhed, in the Annals of America, among her beſt and moſt virtuous Sons, for a <hi>timely</hi> and <hi>reſolute</hi> Defence of her Liberties; and the Virtues, which under the preſent Tax you have deſpiſed and ſlighted, would have been, tho' unmerited, your greateſt Glory— But Charles Townſhend, with an artful and penetrating Eye, ſaw clearly to the Bottom of your Hearts—He knew, that, the private Intereſts of the Merchants were the Rocks againſt which Greenville's favorite <hi>Argo</hi> had unfortunately ſplit; and that no Act of Parliament, for raiſing a Revenue in America, could be executed without <hi>their</hi> Conſent and Approbation.</p>
            <p>"To this Gentleman, you muſt attribute the Loſs of your Reputation: and it was, certainly, <hi>your</hi> Misfortune, and the Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of <hi>all America,</hi> that you did not know <hi>him,</hi> as well as he knew <hi>you,</hi>—He impoſed Duties upon Paper, Glaſs, and Painters Colours; Articles of Commerce, which will prove moſt grevious Taxes upon the Country in general; but cannot affect you, as Merchants: For it is notorious, that a Merchant muſt have his Profit on every Article of his Trade, let the Original Coſt be what it may: <q>The Purchaſer of any Article, very ſeldom reflects that the Seller raiſes his Price, ſo as to indemnify himſelf for the Tax he has paid. He knows that the Prices of things are continually fluctuating, and if he thinks about the Tax, he thinks at the ſame Time, in all probability, that he might have paid as much, if the Articles he buys had not been taxed. He gets ſomething viſible and agreeable for his Money; and Tax and Price are ſo confounded together, that he cannot ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, or does not chuſe to take the Trouble of ſeparating them.</q>—Thus have the People of your Province been deceived into a Paciſic Compliance with this particular Act, the Preamble of which declares it is intended to raiſe a Revenue in America. You did not eſteem it your Duty, as Merchants nor as American Freemen, to oppoſe it; BECAUSE IT DID NOT DIRECTLY AFFECT YOUR PRIVATE INTERESTS. The Parliamentary Right, of Taxing America, you thought of little Conſequence, when compared with your own Eaſe and Safety—You concluded, that although it was <hi>unconſtitutional,</hi> it could not do much Harm in your Time, and, that, if your Poſterity did not like it, or found it inſupportable,—they might endeavour to <hi>remove</hi> it.—By ſuch deceitful Reaſoning, you perſuaded yourſelves you were diſcharging your Duty; when you were induſtriouſly riveting Chains upon your Deſcendants, who will have no great Cauſe of Obligation to you for ſuch diſtinguiſhed Favours—The Merchants in the Northern Colonies, deſpiſed theſe inglorious Motives: They were willing to loſe their <hi>whole Trade,</hi> rather than ſuffer their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to be enſlaved—and for this Reaſon determined to ſuſpend the Importation of Goods from Great-Britain, until the ſeveral Acts of P—t impoſing Duties on America, were repealed.—This was <hi>their</hi> Virtue! This <hi>their</hi> Reſolution!—Your Oppoſition to this Meaſure prevented it from taking Effect, and you may thank yourſelves for the bleſſed Conſequences which are like to follow. —</p>
            <p>"Theſe Reflections may appear harſh and uncharitable; but they are the Reflections of every man, who is not tinctured with the <hi>local</hi> Prejudices of your Province—Believe me, your Oppoſition to the Propoſal of the Merchants of New-York and Boſton, although it might have been founded upon ſpecious Arguments, has done infinite Prejudice to the American Cauſe; and created great Jealouſies in your Neighbours Breaſts; which, nothing, but your determined Reſolution to aſſiſt in removing thoſe heavy Burthens, with which they and you are equally oppreſſed, will effectually heal—An Union, between the ſeveral Colonies in Sentiment and Action, is eſſentially neceſſary to their Preſervation; and had not my Lord H— h been informed, that we were diſ-united in both—he would never have treated the Inhabitants of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay with ſo much ſeverity; nor the other Colonies with ſuch indignity. His Lordſhip imagined, from the Diſunion of theſe Provinces, of which no Doubt he has had faithful Intelligence, that Dragooning of <hi>One</hi> would intimidate and ſilence the <hi>Reſt;</hi> and his Judgment was founded upon a plauſible Principle—However, "there are things which at ſometimes even Slaves will not bear;" and I apprehend his Lordſhip<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

            <p>"It is, certainly, a moſt cruel Dilemma, to be obliged to ſacrifice every Thing that is moſt dear and valuable among Men, or to contend with our Mother Country.—But let us not, in this Caſe, diſtinguiſh Great-Britain from any other Power — To

            <p>"The Privernates had been ſeveral Times ſubdued by the Romans, and had as often revolted; but their City was at laſt retaken by the Conſul Plautius—In theſe diſtreſſed Circumſtances they ſent Ambaſſadors to Rome, to ſue for Peace—Upon a Senator's aſking them what Puniſhment they thought they deſerved; one of them anſwered, 'That which is due to Men who think themſelves worthy of Liberty.' Then the Conſul aſked them, whether there was any Room to hope, that they would obſerve the Peace, if their Fault was pardoned? 'The peace ſhall be perpetual between us,' replied the Ambaſſador, "and we ſhall faithfully obſerve it, if the Conditions you lay upon us are <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>reaſonable;</hi> but if they are <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>diſhonorable,</hi> the peace will not be of long Continuance, and we ſhall very ſoon break it.'</p>
            <p>"Though ſome of the Senators were offended at this Anſwer, yet moſt of them approved of it, and ſaid that 'it was worthy of a <hi>Man</hi> and of a Man that was <hi>born free:</hi>' acknowledging therefore the Force of the Rights of human Nature, they cried out, that 'thoſe alone deſerved to be Citizens of Rome, <hi>who eſteemed nothing in compariſon of Liberty.</hi>' Thus the very Perſons, who were at firſt threatned with Puniſhment, were admitted to the Rights of Citizens, and obtained the Conditions they wanted; the generous Refuſal of the Privernates to comply with the Terms of a diſhonourable Treaty, gained them the Privilege of being incorporated into a State, which at that Time could boaſt of the braveſt, and moſt virtuous Subjects in the Univerſe."</p>
