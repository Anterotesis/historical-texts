            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">I. A REMEMBRANCE of the ſtate of death we once were in, may be as a warning to beware of returning thither again. What bondage we were in when we were ſlaves to ſin—upon the road to hell! Then we loved ſin, but now we profeſs to hate it. Forget not, O my ſoul, the wormwood and the gall; remember what trouble and diſtreſs ſin brought upon thee, under which ſoul and body muſt have ſunk forever, were it not for the bleſſed JESUS. I charge thee O my ſoul, to beware of ſin—forſake the city of deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—flee to the mountain—tarry not in all the plain, leſt thou be conſumed. Oh, may I never be ſo amazing fooliſh, as to caſt off the eaſy yoke of the lovely JESUS, and to be again entangled with the yoke of bondage.</p>
            <l>Oh! What a wretched ſtate of ſin,</l>
            <l>What clouds of darkneſs I was in—</l>
            <l>By nature all undone:</l>
            <l>But Oh! The rich and wond'rous love,</l>
            <l>That comes ſo ſweetly from above,</l>
            <l>Thro' GOD's beloved SON!</l>

               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:034555_0004_0FFE276048F28AE8"/>II. THE wonderous way that our ſouls are delivered from our death ſtate ſhould be a ſtrong motive to engage us to live to the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of GOD. Behold the LAMB of GOD, O my ſoul! Take a view of what this lovely Being underwent to redeem thee, not only from miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, but alſo from ſin. He was a man of ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, and acquainted with grief, while he lived on earth, not for his own ſins, for he was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly pure; but he was wounded for our tranſgreſſions. Oh! What diſtreſs JESUS un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derwent, when being in an agony, he prayed more earneſtly, and his ſweat was as it were great drops of blood falling to the ground.— Oh! Is not this enough to excite me to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim eternal war againſt ſin? Can I hug the ſerpent in my boſom, that cauſed the Beauty of Heaven to be covered with blood? That cauſed the bleſſed Sun of glory to be eclipſed for a ſeaſon? Oh! What ſorrows he under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>went in the garden, when he ſaid, <hi>My ſoul is exceeding ſorrowful, even unto death!</hi> Was there no mortal then to watch with the bleſſed JESUS in this diſtreſſing hour? Could not his own diſciples, for whoſe ſake he was ſuffering, have ſo much of a ſympathy with him in his diſtreſs, as to keep awake one hour, when he bid them watch with him? No—this bleſſed ONE muſt bear the weight of his people's ſins alone— none was able or willing to help<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Who can conceive what he underwent in the garden! But that was not all; he muſt ſuffer vaſtly
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:034555_0005_0FFE272840B83440"/>
more before he could ſay, <hi>It is finiſhed.</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the ſuffering JESUS—His ſoul was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding ſorrowful, even unto death, to redeem my poor ſoul from eternal death! His bleſſed innocent body was alſo tormented, even unto death, to ſave my poor body from the power of death. Can I bear to behold by faith, how thoſe bleſſed hands and feet were nailed to the croſs, until ſin and ſinners tormented the SON of GOD to death. Oh! Amazing love and pity! Did the King of Glory undergo all this, and vaſtly more than I can conceive, to redeem my ſoul and body from ſin and death, and ſhall not the ſoul and body thus redeemed, be entirely at his command? Surely the ſenſe of theſe things, will make every ſoul that loves GOD, hate ſin. Am I bought with ſuch a price, and ſhall I not glorify GOD with my body and ſpirit, which are his?</p>
            <l>Can I believe that CHRIST did die,</l>
            <l>To ranſom ſuch a worm as I,</l>

Doth our kind LORD give ſo many ſweet coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels and loving invitations to us, unworthy ſinners, to walk in his pleaſant ways, and ſhall we take no heed to walk in the law of the LORD, with all our heart? Take heed, O my ſoul, leſt thou ſin againſt pure love and ſweet compaſſion. There is no way good or pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant but that which our bleſſed REDEEMER walked in. Great peace have they who love his law, and nothing ſhall offend them. Oh! What peace and joy we have found in obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the commands of GOD! What can be more fooliſh than for a ſoul to leave this bright and ſhining way that leads to eternal glory, and turn aſide after poor toys, that are good for nothing, among briers and thorns, dragons, lions, and ſerpents, and all manner of dangers, with the hazard of loſing heaven and obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hell? Sweet promiſes and rich bleſſings, are ſtrewed like roſes under our feet, all along the way to glory: But threatenings and curſes are ſcattered in all other paths. Godlineſs is profitable unto all things, having the promiſes of the life that now is, and of that which is to come. None can tell the advantage and prof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it the honour and pleaſure, the beauty and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <l>That leads to Paradiſe;</l>

            <l>To ſee their lovely CHRIST!</l>
            <p n="4">IV. THE danger of going back from a good beginning ſhould make us afraid to ſin againſt GOD, and ſhun every temptation that would entice us to depart from the LORD.— We muſt not ſo much as look back with a deſire after any ſinful pleaſure; for the LORD JESUS ſays, "<hi>He that putteth his hand to the plough, and looketh back, is not fit for the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of heaven.</hi>" Take heed, O my ſoul, and beware of a ſinful look. Let us remember Lot's wife; ſhe looked back after ſhe had ſet out to leave Sodom, and behold ſhe is turned into a pillar of ſalt, to ſtand as a warning to all generations! May all profeſſors take no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, and when once ſet out for Mount Zion, never look back with any deſire after what we have left in Sodom. If it is ſo dangerous to look back, what will be the fate of thoſe who not only look, but draw back unto per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition? Hear what the King of Glory ſays— "<hi>If any man draw back, my ſoul ſhall have no pleaſure in him.</hi>" Oh! What a ſolemn warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this! Can I be ſo hardened and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by the flatteries of ſin, as to face all the threatenings in the Bible, rather than face a
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:034555_0008_0FFE276647312408"/>
vain world? Don't I fear the wrath and diſpleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of the Almighty King of heaven and earth, ſo much as the frowns of a few earth worms? It is not only dangerous, but it is hard going back —the way of tranſgreſſors is hard. It is a way of death, and of darkneſs wherein is no pleaſure. Our experience tells us we find no peace in departing from the Prince of Peace. Tho' ſin may deceive us with a vain hope of finding ſatisfaction in purſuing ſomething beſides GOD, yet we ſhall find all the ſweets of ſin, bitter as wormwood, as unſatisfying as gravel or aſhes, and as unwholeſome as the worſt of poiſon.— If our ſchemes ſeem to proſper in a way of ſin, yet we ſhall find that the turning away of the ſimple ſhall ſlay them, and the proſperity of tools ſhall deſtroy them. If the Lord gives us our carnal deſires while we depart from him, he will ſend leanneſs into our ſouls. There is no pleaſure nor ſafety but in living near to GOD.</p>
            <l>Then O my ſoul, beware of ſin:</l>
            <l>LORD make and keep me pure within—</l>
            <l>Oh! May I walk with Thee!</l>
            <l>And never rove, nor go aſtray,</l>
            <l>But walk in CHRIST, my glorious way,</l>
            <l>Until thy face I ſee.</l>
            <p n="5">V. IF we have any love to the ſaints, or pity to poor ſinners, let us take heed to walk like true chriſtians. Can I bear to wound
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034555_0009_0FFE272E1F878498"/>
the lovely Saviour, and thereby wound the hearts of thoſe who love him? Did the dear ſaints rejoice to ſee me make a good profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and now ſhall their ſouls mourn for my falling away? Shall I be a child that cauſes ſhame and ſorrow? Muſt I be a blot and a a diſhonour to the royal family of King JESUS? Oh! May I never bring a reproach upon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and grieve the excellent ones of the earth. May I bear ſo much of the image of the lovely JESUS, that thoſe who love JESUS may be glad when they ſee me! Oh, may we ſit together in heavenly places in CHRIST JE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SUS! It is not only wounding to the ſaints, but cruelty to thoſe that never knew the way of peace, for thoſe who profeſs to be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of the LAMB of GOD, to walk diſagreeable to their profeſſion. Can I bear to help the ſinner down to to hell? Shall I, by my evil example, or vain converſation, be the means of binding the precious ſouls of my dear friends down to everlaſting death, and yet expect my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to obtain everlaſting life? If my conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation is in heaven, I may, by the bleſſing of GOD, be the means of ſaving ſouls from death, and of turning many to righteouſneſs, and have the pleaſure of ſeeing them eternally ſhining in glory: But if I join with ſinners, and walk with them in the ways of ſin, perhaps I ſhall be the means of their going to eternal miſery —like thoſe who would not enter into the kingdom of heaven themſelves, and thoſe that
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:034555_0010_0FFE2767DFF06828"/>
would enter in they hindered. Time is ſhort —Have I one moment to waſte? A long e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternity of joy or ſorrow will ſoon be my a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bode, and the abode of all my friends on earth.</p>
            <l>Saints ſhould not like the ſinners walk,</l>
            <l>Nor join with them in fooliſh talk,</l>
            <l>Or any ſinful way:</l>
            <l>We that profeſs the SAVIOUR's Name,</l>
            <l>Should make his praiſes all our theme,</l>
