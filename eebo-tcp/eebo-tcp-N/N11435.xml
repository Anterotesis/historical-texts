            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following Sermon was drawn up on a few days notice, and without any view to the preſs, at the requeſt of ſome of the Author's worthy Friends, to whom he could refuſe nothing of this kind. At their requeſt, it is now likewiſe ſubmitted to the Public, as it was preached, without varying or ſuppreſſing a ſingle ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent or material expreſſion; and with the addition only of a few lines, and three or four explanatory notes.</p>
            <p>The Author conſidered that, although he was called to this office by a particular body, yet he was to addreſs a great and mixt aſſembly of his fellow-citizens, and a number of the firſt characters in America, now met in conſultation, at a moſt alarming criſis.</p>
            <p>Animated with the pureſt zeal for the mutual intereſts of Great-Britain and the Colonies; ardently panting for the return of thoſe Halcyon-days of harmony, during which both countries ſo long flouriſhed together, as the glory and wonder of the world; he thought it his duty, with the utmoſt impartiality, to attempt a ſtate of the unhappy controverſy that now rends the empire in pieces; and to ſhew, if peradventure he might be permitted to vouch for his fellow citizens, ſo far as he has been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſant among them, that the idea of an independence upon the Parent-country, or the leaſt licentious oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to its juſt intereſts, is utterly foreign to their thoughts; that they contend only for the ſanctity of charters and laws, together with the right of granting their own money; and that our rightful Sovereign has no where more loyal ſubjects, or more zealouſly attached to thoſe principles of government, under which his family inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits the Throne.</p>
            <p>Theſe, with a few things which ſeemed neceſſary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the church at this time, are the topics handled in the following Sermon. If the principles it contains
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:014460_0004_0F92B0F010A1C060"/>
are but thoroughly <hi>felt,</hi> the Reader will not regret that the limits of a ſingle diſcourſe would not allow a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar application of them. They will lead to their own application; or, at leaſt, that field is left open to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Preachers.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, if the kind expectations of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor's Friends can be in any degree anſwered; if what he has delivered ſhall tend "to promote the <hi>Cauſe of Liberty and Virtue;</hi>" and particularly, if it could find its way to the cloſets, or rather to the hearts, of the <hi>Great,</hi> and (after all the arguments they have heard from others) could in the leaſt induce them to juſter and more benevolent ſentiments concerning their American bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren—he would account it among the happieſt circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his life.</p>
            <p>Enough has ſurely been attempted, by way of experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to be convinced that the people of this country know their rights, and will not conſent to a <hi>paſſive</hi> ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of them—It is, now at leaſt, time to purſue ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther mode, and to liſten to ſome plan for averting the dreadful calamities which muſt attend a hoſtile proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this unnatural conteſt. The author's wiſhes for the accompliſhment of ſuch a plan, have been ſo frequently expreſſed as to ſubject him perhaps to ſuſpicions which he would not wiſh to merit, either here or elſe where. But ſtill, if he could ſee it take place, upon a juſt and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent foundation, he would be content, if it were required, to ſing his "<hi>nunc dimittis,</hi>" and to take a final leave of earthly concerns.</p>

            <p>THESE Words, my Brethren, will lead us into a train of reflections, wholly ſuitable to the deſign of our preſent meeting; and I muſt beg your indulgence till I explain, as briefly as poſſible, the ſolemn occaſion on which they were firſt delivered; hoping the application, I may afterwards make of them, may fully reward your attention.</p>
            <p>THE two tribes of Reuben and of Gad, and the half tribe of Manaſſeh, had choſen their inheritance, on the Eaſtern ſide of Jordan, oppoſite to the other tribes of Iſrael. And although they knew that this ſituation would deprive them of ſome privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges which remained with their brethren on the other ſide, and particularly that great privilege of having the place of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tar and Tabernacle of God among them; yet, as the land of Canaan was judged too ſmall for all the twelve tribes, they were contented with the poſſeſſion they had choſen. And thus they ſpoke to Moſes—</p>
            <q>
               <p>IT is a land of cattle, and thy ſervants have much cattle. Wherefore, if we have found grace in thy ſight, let this land be given to us for a poſſeſſion, and we will build ſheepfolds here for our cattle, and cities for our <hi>little ones</hi>; and we our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves will go ready armed before our brethren, the children of Iſrael,—and will not return into our houſes, until they have inherited every man his inheritance.—</p>
               <p>AND Moſes ſaid unto them—If you will do this thing, and will go all of you <hi>armed</hi> over Jordan before the Lord, until he have driven out his enemies from before him; and the land (of Canaan) be ſubdued (for your brethren;) then after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards ye ſhall return, and this land (of Gilead) ſhall be your poſſeſſion before the Lord</p>
               <bibl>—Numb. 32.</bibl>
            </q>
            <p>THIS, then, was the great <hi>original contract,</hi> under which theſe two tribes and a half were allowed to ſeparate from the reſt, and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014460_0006_0F92B0F1AB4243B8"/>
to dwell on the other ſide of Jordan. They were to aſſiſt their brethren in their neceſſary wars, and to continue under <hi>one Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment</hi>
with them—even that of the great Jehovah himſelf— erecting no ſeparate altar, but coming to perform their ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices at that <hi>one Altar</hi> of SHILOH, where the Lord had vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to promiſe his ſpecial preſence.</p>
            <p>THOUGH this ſubjected them to inconveniencies, yet as Uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity of Worſhip and the Nature of their <hi>Theocracy</hi> required it, they adhered faithfully to their contract.</p>
            <p>IN the fear of God, they bowed themſelves at his altar, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though not placed in their own land; and, in love to their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, they ſupported them in their wars, "till there ſtood not a man of all their enemies before them;" and at laſt, JOSHUA, their great leader, having no farther need of their aſſiſtance, gave them this noble teſtimony—That they had in all things obey'd his voice as their general, and faithfully performed all that they had promiſed to Moſes the ſervant of God. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, he bleſſed them, and diſmiſſed them to return to their own land <q>with much riches, and with cattle, and with ſilver, and with gold, and with much raiment.</q>
            </p>
            <p>No ſooner, therefore, had they entered their own country, than in the fullneſs of gratitude, on the banks of Jordan, at the common paſſage, over againſt Canaan, they built an <hi>high</hi> or <hi>great Altar,</hi> that it might remain an eternal monument of their being of one ſtock, and entitled to the ſame civil and religious privileges, with their brethren of the other tribes.</p>
            <p>BUT this their work of piety and love was directly miſconſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. The cry was immediately raiſed againſt them. The zea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots of that day ſcrupled not to declare them <hi>Rebels</hi> againſt the living God, violators of his ſacred laws and <hi>Theocracy,</hi> in ſetting up an altar againſt his holy altar; and therefore the whole con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations of the brother-tribes, that dwelt in Canaan, gathered themſelves together, to go up to war againſt their own fleſh and blood; in a blind tranſport of unrighteous zeal, purpoſing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirpate them from the face of the earth, as enemies to God and the common wealth of Iſrael!</p>
            <p>IN that awful and important moment (and oh my God that the example could be copied among the brother-tribes of our Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, in the parent land) I ſay, in that awful and important moment, ſome milder and more benevolent men there were, whoſe zeal did not ſo far tranſport them, but that, before they unſheath'd the ſword to plunge it with unhallowed hand into the bowels of their brethren, they thought it juſtice firſt to enquire into the truth of the charge againſt them. And, for the glory of Iſrael, this peaceable and prudent council prevailed.</p>
            <p>A MOST ſolemn embaſſy was prepared, at the head of which
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:014460_0007_0F92B0F1E5DDFC28"/>
was a man of ſacred character, and venerable authority, breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the dictates of religion and humanity; PHINEHAS the ſon of Eleazer the high Prieſt, accompanied with ten other Chiefs or Princes, one from each of the nine tribes as well as from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining half tribe of Manaſſeh.</p>
            <p>GREAT was the aſtoniſhment of the <note n="*" place="bottom">The two tribes and a half are here briefly and generally denominat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gileadites, from the name of the land they had choſen.</note> Gileadites on receiving this embaſſy, and hearing the charge againſt them. But the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of conſcious innocence is above all fear, and the language of an upright heart ſuperior to all eloquence. By a ſolemn appeal to Heaven for the rectitude of their intentions, unpremeditated and vehement in the words of my text, they diſarmed their brethren of every ſuſpicion.</p>
            <p>"THE Lord God of Gods," ſay they (in the fervency of truth, repeating the invocation) "the Lord God of Gods,"—He that made the heavens and the earth, who ſearcheth the hearts, and is acquainted with the moſt ſacred thoughts, of all men—"He knoweth, and all Iſrael ſhall know," by our unſhaken conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy in the religion of our fathers,—that this charge againſt us is utterly falſe.</p>
            <p>THEN turning from their brethren, with unſpeakable dignity of ſoul and clearneſs of conſcience, they addreſs the almighty Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah himſelf—</p>
            <p>OH thou ſovereign Ruler of the univerſe—our God and our Fathers God—"if it be in Rebellion or in tranſgreſſion againſt thee," that we have raiſed this monument of our zeal for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth of Iſrael—"SAVE US NOT THIS DAY!" If the moſt diſtant thought has entered our hearts of erecting an <hi>independent altar</hi>; if we have ſought, in one inſtance, to derogate from the glory of that ſacred Altar which thou haſt placed among our bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren beyond Jordan, as the common bond of union and worſhip among all the tribes of Iſrael—let not this day's ſun deſcend up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, till thou haſt made us a monument of thine avenging ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtice, in the ſight of the ſurrounding world!</p>
            <p>AFTER this aſtoniſhing appeal to the great God of Heaven and Earth, they proceed to reaſon with their brethren; and tell them that, ſo far from intending a ſeparation either in government or religion, this altar was built with a direct contrary purpoſe— <q>That it might be a witneſs between us and you, and our gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations after us; that your children may not ſay to our children in time to come, ye have no part in the Lord.</q>
We were afraid leſt in ſome future age, when our poſterity may croſs Jordan to offer ſacrifices in the place appointed, your poſterity may thruſt them from the altar, and tell them that becauſe they live not in

the land where the Lord's tabernacle dwelleth, they are none of his people, nor intitled to the Jewiſh privileges.</p>
            <p>BUT while this altar ſtands, they ſhall always have an anſwer ready. They will be able to ſay— <q>Behold the pattern of the altar of the Lord which our fathers made.</q>
If our fathers had not been of the ſeed of Iſrael, they would not have fondly copied your cuſtoms and models. You would not have beheld in <hi>Gile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ad,</hi> an altar, in all things an imitation of the true altar of God, which is in Shiloh; except only that ours is an high "or great altar to ſee" from far. And this may convince you that it was not intended as an altar of ſacrifice (for then it would have been but three cubits in height, as our law directs) but as a monument<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al altar, to inſtruct our generations for ever, that they are of the ſame pedigree with yourſelves, and intitled to the ſame civil and religious privileges.</p>
            <p>THIS noble defence wrought an immediate reconciliation a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the diſcordant tribes. <q>The Words, (when reported) pleaſed the children of Iſrael—they bleſſed God together</q>
for preventing the effuſion of kindred blood, <q>and did not go up to deſtroy the land where their brethren, the children of Reu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ben <note n="†" place="bottom">Though for brevity, the ſacred text, in this and other places, only mentions Reuben and Gad, yet the half tribe of Manaſſeh is alſo ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be included.</note> and Gad, dwelt.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE whole hiſtory of the Bible cannot furniſh a paſſage more inſtructive than this, to the members of a great empire, whoſe dreadful misfortune it is to have the evil Demon of civil or reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious <hi>diſcord</hi> gone forth among them. And would to God, that the application I am now to make of it could be delivered in ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents louder than Thunder, till they have pierced the ear of every Briton, and eſpecially their ears who have meditated war and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction againſt their brother-tribes of Reuben and Gad, in this our <hi>American Gilead.</hi> And let me add—would to God too that we, who this day conſider ourſelves in the place of thoſe tribes, may, like them, be ſtill able to lay our hands on our hearts in a ſolemn appeal to the God of Gods, for the rectitude of our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions towards the <hi>whole</hi> common wealth of our BRITISH IS<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RAEL. For, call'd to this ſacred place, on this great occaſion, I know it is your wiſh that I ſhould ſtand ſuperior to all <hi>partial motives,</hi> and be found alike unbiaſs'd by favour or by fear. And happy it is that the parallel, now to be drawn, requires not the leaſt ſacrifice either of truth or virtue!</p>
            <p>LIKE the tribes of Reuben and Gad, we have choſen our inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance, in a land ſeperated from that of our fathers and brethren, not indeed by a ſmall River, but an immenſe Ocean. This in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:014460_0009_0F92B0F4478BBB70"/>
we likewiſe hold by a plain <hi>original contract,</hi> entitling us to all the natural and improvable advantages of our ſituation, and to a community of privileges with our brethren, in every civil and religious reſpect; except in this, that the throne or ſeat of Empire, that great altar at which the men of this world bow, was to remain among them.</p>
            <p>REGARDLESS of this local inconvenience, uncanker'd by jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy, un-depreſs'd by fear, and cemented by mutual love and mutual benefits, we trod the path of glory with our brethren for an hundred years and more—enjoying a length of felicity ſcarce e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver experienced by any other people. Mindful of the hands that protected us in our youth and ſubmitting to every juſt regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for appropriating to them the Benefit of our trade—our wealth was poured in upon them from ten thouſand channels, widening as they flowed, and making their poor to ſing, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry to ſmile, through every corner of their land. And as of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten as dangers threaten'd, and the voice of the Britiſh Iſrael called our brethren to the field, we left them not alone, but ſhared their toils, and ſought by their ſide, <q>till there ſtood not a man of all their enemies before them.</q>
Nay, they themſelves teſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on our behalf, that in all things we not only did our part, but more than our part for the common Good, and they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs'd us home loaded with ſilver and with gold, <note n="*" place="bottom">The parliamentary reinburſements for our exertions in the late war; ſimilar to what Joſhua gave the two tribes and a half on the cloſe of his wars.</note> in recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence for our extraordinary ſervices.</p>
            <p>So far you ſee the parallel holds good. But what <hi>high altars</hi>
have we built to alarm our Britiſh Iſrael; and why have the congregations of our brethren gathered themſelves together a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us? why do their embattled hoſts already cover our plains? will they not examine our caſe, and liſten to our plea?</p>
            <p>"THE Lord God of Gods—he knows" and the whole ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounding world ſhall yet know, that whatever <hi>American altars</hi> we have built, far from intending to diſhonour, have been raiſed with an expreſs view to perpetuate the name and glory of that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred altar, and ſeat of empire and liberty, which we left behind us, and wiſh to remain eternal, among our brethren, in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent land!</p>
            <p>ESTEEMING our relation to them our greateſt felicity; ador<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the providence that gave us the ſame progenitors; glory<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in this, that when the <hi>new-world</hi> was to be portioned out among the kingdoms of the <hi>old,</hi> the moſt important part of this continent fell to the ſons of a proteſtant and free nation; deſirous of worſhiping for ever at the ſame altar with them;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014460_0010_0F92B0F64C885408"/>
fond of their manners, even to exceſs; enthuſiaſts to that ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred plan of civil and religious happineſs, for the preſervation of which they have ſacrificed from age to age; maintaining, and always ready to maintain, at the riſque of every thing that is dear to us, the moſt unſhaken fidelity to our common Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, as the great center of our union, and guardian of our mutual rights;—I ſay, with theſe principles and theſe views, we thought it our duty, to build up American altars, or <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions,</hi> as nearly as we could, upon the great Britiſh model.</p>
            <p>HAVING never ſold our birth-right, we conſidered ourſelves entitled to the privileges of our father's houſe—"to enjoy peace, liberty and ſafety;" to be governed, like our brethren, by our own laws, in all matters properly affecting ourſelves, and to offer up own our ſacrifices at the altar of Britiſh empire; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending that a forced devotion is idolatry, and that no power on earth has a right to come in between us and a gracious ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, to meaſure forth our loyalty, or to grant our property, <hi>without our conſent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THESE are the principles we inherited from Britons themſelves. Could we depart from them, we ſhould be deemed baſtards and not ſons, aliens and not brethren.</p>
            <p>THE altars therefore which we have built, are not <note n="*" place="bottom">In this reſpect, our plea is even ſtronger than that of the two tribes and a half. For, till an explanation was given, the <hi>height</hi> of their altar, like thoſe of the heathen, who loved to ſacrifice on lofty places, might create a ſuſpicion of their <q>lapſing into idolatry; either intending to worſhip other Gods, or the God of Iſrael in an unlaw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful place and manner.</q>

            <p>IT was our wiſh that there ſhould be an eternal "Witneſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our brethren and us; that if at any future period, amid the ſhifting ſcenes of human intereſts and human affections, their children ſhould ſay to our children—"Ye have no portion" in the birth-right of Britons, and ſo ſeek to puſh them from the common ſhrine of Freedom, when they come to pay their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage there; they might always have an anſwer ready—"Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold the pattern of the altar which our Fathers built." Behold your own religious and civil inſtitutions, and then examine the frames of government and ſyſtems of laws raiſed by our fathers in every part of America! Could theſe have been ſuch exact

copies of your own, if they had not inherited the ſame ſpirit, and ſprung from the ſame ſtock, with yourſelvs.</p>
            <p>THUS far you ſee the parallel yet holds good, and I think cannot be called a perverſion of my text; if you will allow that the ſupreme power of an empire, whether theocratical, monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chical, or howſoever diſtributed, may be repreſented under the figure of <hi>one</hi> common <hi>altar,</hi> at which the juſt devotion of all the ſubjects is to be paid.</p>
            <p>BUT it is ſaid that we have of late departed from our for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer line of duty, and <hi>refuſed</hi> our homage at the great <hi>altar</hi> of Britiſh empire. And to this it has been replied, that the very <hi>refuſal</hi> is the ſtrongeſt evidence of our veneration for the <hi>altar</hi> it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Nay, it is contended by thoſe charged with this breach of devotion, that when in the ſhape of unconſtitutional exacti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, violated rights and mutilated charters, they were called to worſhip <hi>idols,</hi> inſtead of the true <hi>divinity,</hi> it was in a tranſport of holy jealouſy, that they daſhed them to pieces, or whelm'd them to the bottom of the ocean.</p>
            <p>THIS is, in brief, the ſtate of the argument on each ſide. And hence, at this dreadful moment, ancient friends and bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren ſtand prepared for events of the moſt tragic nature.</p>
            <p>HERE the weight of my ſubject almoſt overcomes me; but think not that I am going to damp that noble ardor which at this inſtant glows in every boſom preſent. Nevertheleſs, as from an early acquaintance with many of you, I know that your principles are pure, and your humanity only equal'd by your tranſcendent love of your country, I am ſure you will indulge the paſſing tear, which a preacher of the Goſpel of Love muſt now ſhed over the ſcenes that lie before us—Great and deep diſtreſs about to pervade every corner of our land! millions to be called from their peaceful labors by "the ſound of the trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet, and the alarm of war! Garments roll'd in blood," and even Victory itſelf only yielding an occaſion to weep over friends and relatives ſlain! Theſe are melancholy proſpects; and therefore you will feel with me the difficulties I now labour under—forſaken by my text, and left to lament alone that, in the Parent-land, no PHINEHAS has prevailed; no Embaſſy <note n="*" place="bottom">It is acknowledged with gratitude that many great and exalted characters have pled the cauſe of America; and, previous to all coer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive meaſures, adviſed an enquiry or hearing, ſimilar to that for which <hi>Phinehas</hi> was appointed.

to examine into the truth of our caſe, and ſave the effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of kindred blood. I am left to lament that, in this ſad in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, <hi>Jewiſh</hi> tenderneſs has put <hi>Chriſtian</hi> benevolence to ſhame.</p>
            <p>
               <q>OUR Brethren, the houſe of our Fathers, even they have called a multitude againſt us. Had an enemy thus reproach'd us, then perhaps we might have borne it. But is was you, Men our equals, our guides, our acquaintance, with whom we took ſweet council and walked together into the houſe of God.</q>
Or had it been for any eſſential benefit to the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth at large, we would have laid our hands on our mouths and bowed obedience with our uſual ſilence. But for DIGNITY and SUPREMACY! What are they when ſet in oppoſition to common utility, common juſtice, and the whole faith and ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Conſtitution? True Dignity is to govern Freemen, not Slaves: and true Supremacy is to excel in Doing Good.</p>
            <p>IT is time, and indeed more than time, for a great and enlighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed people to make <hi>names</hi> bend to <hi>things,</hi> and <hi>ideal honor</hi> to <hi>practical ſafety?</hi> Precedents and indefinite claims are ſurely things too nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory to convulſe a mighty empire. Is there no wiſdom, no great and liberal plan of policy to re-unite its members, as the ſole bulwark of liberty and proteſtantiſm; rather than by their deadly ſtrife to encreaſe the importance of thoſe ſtates that are foes to freedom, truth and humanity? To deviſe ſuch a plan; and to behold Britiſh Colonies ſpreading over this immenſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, rejoicing in the common rights of freemen, and imitat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Parent State in every excellence—is more glory than to hold lawleſs dominion over all the nations on the face of the earth!</p>
            <p>BUT I will weary you no longer with fruitleſs lamentations concerning things that <hi>might be</hi> done. The queſtion now is— ſince they are not done, muſt we tamely ſurrender any part of our birthright or of that great charter of privileges, which we not only claim by inheritance, but by the expreſs terms of our co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonization? I ſay, <hi>God forbid!</hi> For here, in particular, I wiſh to ſpeak ſo plain that neither my own principles, nor thoſe of the church to which I belong, may be miſunderſtood.</p>
            <p>ALTHOUGH, in the beginning of this great conteſt, we thought it not our duty to be forward in widening the breach, or ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſcontent; although it be our fervent deſire to heal the wounds of the public, and to ſhew by our temper that we ſeek not to diſtreſs, but to give the parent ſtate an opportunity of ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves and ſaving us before it be too late; nevertheleſs, as we know that our civil and religious rights are linked together in one indiſſoluble bond, we neither have, nor ſeek to have, any intereſt ſeparate from that of our country; nor can we adviſe a deſertion of its cauſe. Religion and liberty muſt flouriſh or fall together in America. We pray that both may be perpetual.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:014460_0013_0F92B0F92D6FC660"/>A CONTINUED ſubmiſſion to violence is no tenet of our church. When her brighteſt luminaries, near a century paſt, were called to propagate the court doctrine of a <hi>diſpenſing Power, above Law</hi>— did they treacherouſly cry—"<hi>Peace, Peace,</hi>" when there was no <hi>Peace!</hi> Did they not magnanimouſly ſet their foot upon the line of the conſtitution, and tell Majeſty to its face that "they could not betray the public liberty," and that the Monarch's only ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty conſiſted "in governing according to the laws?" Did not their axample, and conſequent ſufferings, kindle a flame that il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luminated the land and introduced that noble ſyſtem of public and perſonal liberty, ſecured by the revolution? Since that period, have not the avowed principles of our greateſt divines been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt raiſing the <hi>Church</hi> above the <hi>State</hi>; jealouſe of the national rights, reſolute for the <hi>proteſtant</hi> ſucceſſion, favourable to the <hi>reformed</hi> religion, and deſirous to maintain the faith of <hi>Toleration?</hi>
If exceptions have happened, let no ſociety of chriſtians ſtand an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable for the deviations, or corruptions, of individuals.</p>
            <p>THE doctrine of abſolute NON-RESISTANCE has been fully exploded among every v<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

But to draw the line, and ſay where ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion ends and reſiſtance begins, is not the province of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters of Chriſt, who has given no <note n="*" place="bottom">The author, in a ſermon firſt publiſhed <hi>20</hi> years ago, on <hi>1</hi> Peter <hi>ii, 17.</hi> delivered his ſentiments fully on this point—in the following words, viz.—"It would be abſurd to argue as ſome have done, that the apoſtle here meant to enjoin a <hi>continued ſubmiſſion</hi> to violence—The love of mankind, and the fear of God, thoſe very principles from which we trace the divine original of juſt government, will lead us, by all probable means, to reſiſt every attempt to enſlave the free-born ſoul, and oppoſe the righteous will of God by defeating the happineſs of men. Reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, however, is to be a laſt reſource, and none but the majority of a whole people, can determine in what caſes it is neceſſary. In the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, therefore, obedience is rightly inculcated in general terms. For a people may ſometimes imagine grievances they do not feel, but will never miſs to feel and complain of them where they really are, unleſs their minds have been gradually prepared for ſlavery by abſurd tenets."</note> rule in this matter, but left it to the feelings and conſciences of the injured. For when preſſures and ſufferings come, when the weight of power grows intolerable, a people will fly to the conſtitution for ſhelter, and, if able, will reſume that power which they never ſurrendered, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept ſo far as it might be exerciſed for the common ſafety. Pul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pit-caſuiſtry is too feeble to direct or controul here. God, in
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:014460_0014_0F92B0F96C445A08"/>
his own government of the world, never violates freedom; and his ſcriptures themſelves would be diſregarded, or conſidered as perverted, if brought to belie his voice, ſpeaking in the hearts of men.</p>
            <p>THE application of theſe principles, my brethren, is now ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy and muſt be left to your own conſciences and feelings. You are now engaged in one of the grandeſt ſtruggles, to which free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men can be called. You are contending for what you conceive to be your conſtitutional rights, and for a final ſettlement of the terms upon which this country may be perpetually united to the Parent State.</p>
            <p>LOOK back, therefore, with reverence look back, to the times of ancient virtue and renown. Look back to the mighty pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes which your fathers had in view, when they traverſed a vaſt ocean, and planted this land. Recal to your minds their labors, their toils, their perſeverance, and let their divine ſpirit animate you in all your actions.</p>
            <p>LOOK forward alſo to diſtant poſterity. Figure to yourſelves millions and millions to ſpring from your loins, who may be born <hi>freemen</hi> or <hi>ſlaves</hi> as Heaven ſhall now approve or reject your councils. Think that on you it may depend, whether this great country, in ages hence, ſhall be filled and adorned with a virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and enlightened people; enjoying LIBERTY and all its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comitant bleſſings, together with the RELIGION of JESUS, as it flows uncorrupted from his holy Oracles; or covered with a race of men more contemptible than the ſavages that roam the wilderneſs, becauſe they once knew the <q>things which belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to their happineſs and peace, but ſuffered them to be hid from their eyes.</q>
            </p>
            <p>AND while you thus look <hi>back</hi> to the <hi>paſt,</hi> and <hi>forward</hi> to the future, fail not, I beſeech you, to <hi>look up</hi> to "the God of Gods— the Rock of your Salvation. As the clay in the potter's hands," ſo are the nations of the earth in the hands of Him. the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting JEHOVAH! He lifteth up—and he caſteth down <q>—He reſiſteth the proud, and giveth grace to the humble—He will keep the feet of his ſaints—the wicked ſhall be ſilent in dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and by ſtrength ſhall no man prevail.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THE bright proſpects of the Goſpel; a thorough veneration of the Saviour of the world; a conſcientious obedience to his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine laws; faith in his promiſes; and the ſtedfaſt hope of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal life through him; theſe only can ſupport a man in all times of adverſity as well as proſperity. You might more eaſily "ſtrike fire out of ice," than ſtability or magnanimity out of crimes. But the good man, he who is at peace with the God of all peace, will know no fear but that of offending him, whoſe hand can cover the righteous <q>ſo that he needs not fear the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row

that fleeth by day, nor the deſtruction that waſteth at noon-day; for a thouſand ſhall fall beſide him, and ten thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand at his right hand, but it ſhall not come nigh to him; for he ſhall give his angels charge over him to keep him in all his ways</q>
            </p>
            <p>ON the omnipotent God, therefore, thro' his bleſſed Son, let your ſtrong confidence be placed; but do not vainly expect that every day will be to you a day of proſperity or triumph. The ways of providence lie through mazes, too intricate for human penetration. Mercies may often be held forth to us in the ſhape of ſufferings; and the viciſſitudes of our fortune in building up this American fabric of happineſs and glory may be various and chequer'd.</p>
            <p>BUT let not this diſcourage you. Yea rather let it animate you with a holy <hi>fervor</hi>—a divine <hi>enthuſiaſm</hi>—ever perſuading yourſelves that the cauſe of <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>Freedom</hi> is the CAUSE of GOD upon earth; and that the whole theatre of human nature does not exhibit a more auguſt ſpectacle than a number of Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, in dependence upon Heaven, mutually binding themſelves to encounter every difficulty and danger in ſupport of their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and conſtitutional rights, and for tranſmitting them wholly and unviolated to their poſterity.</p>
            <p>IT was this principle that inſpired the heroes of ancient times; that raiſed their names to the ſummit of renown, and filled all ſucceeding ages with their unſpotted praiſe. It is this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple too that muſt animate your conduct, if you wiſh your names to reach future generations, conſpicuous in the roll of glory; and ſo far as this principle leads you, be prepared to follow— whether to life or to death.</p>
            <p>WHILE you profeſs yourſelves contending for Liberty, let it be with the temper and dignity of freemen, undaunted and firm, but without wrath or vengeance, ſo far as grace may be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to aſſiſt the weakneſs of nature. Conſider it as a happy cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance, if ſuch a ſtruggle muſt have happened, that God hath been pleaſed to poſtpone it to a period, when our country is adorned with men of enlightened zeal; when the arts and ſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences are planted among us to ſecure a ſucceſſion of ſuch men; when our morals are not far tainted by luxury, profuſion or diſſipation; when the principles that withſtood oppreſſion, in the brighteſt aera of the Engliſh hiſtory, are ours as it were by peculiar inheritance; and when we ſtand upon our own ground, with all that is dear around us, animating us to every patriotic exertion. Under ſuch circumſtances and upon ſuch principles, what wonders, what atchievements of true glory, have not been performed!</p>
            <p>FOR my part, I have long been poſſeſſed with a ſtrong and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:014460_0016_0F92B0FC5DFDCBA0"/>
even enthuſiaſtic perſuaſion, that Heaven has great and gracious purpoſes towards this continent, which no human power or human device ſhall be able finally to fruſtrate. Illiberal or miſtaken plans of policy may diſtreſs us for a while, and perhaps ſorely check our growth; but if we maintain our own virtue; if we cultivate the ſpirit of Liberty among our children; if we guard againſt the ſnares of luxury, venality and corruption; the GENIUS of AMERICA will ſtill riſe tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphant, and that with a power at laſt too mighty for oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. This country <hi>will be free</hi>—nay, for ages to come, a choſen ſeat of <hi>Freedom, Arts,</hi> and <hi>heavenly knowledge</hi>; which are now either drooping or dead in moſt countries of the old world.</p>
            <p>To conclude, ſince the <hi>ſtrength</hi> of all public bodies, under God, conſiſts in their UNION; bear with each other's infirmities, and even varieties of ſentiments, in things not eſſential to the main point. The tempers of men are caſt in various molds. Some are quick and <hi>feelingly alive</hi> in all their mental operations, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe which relate to their country's weal, and are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ready to burſt forth into flame upon every alarm. Others a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain, with intentions alike pure, and a clear unquenchable love of their country, too ſtedfaſt to be damped by the miſts of preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice, or worked up into conflagration by the rude blaſts of paſſion, think it their duty to weigh conſequences, and to deliberate fully upon the probable means of obtaining public ends. Both theſe kinds of men ſhould bear with each other; for both are friends to their country.</p>
            <p>ONE thing further let me add, that without <hi>order</hi> and juſt <hi>ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bordination,</hi> there can be no <hi>union</hi> in public bodies. However much you may be equals on other occaſions, yet all this muſt ceaſe in an united and aſſociated capacity; and every individual is bound to keep the place and duty aſſigned him, by ties far more powerful over a man of virtue and honour, than all the other ties which human policy can contrive. It had been better never to have lifted a voice in your country's cauſe, than to betray it by want of <hi>Union</hi>; or to leave worthy men, who have embarked their all for the common good, to ſuffer, or ſtand unaſſiſted.</p>
            <p>LASTLY, by every method in your power, and in every poſſible caſe, ſupport the LAWS of your country. In a conteſt for liberty, think what a crime it would be, to ſuffer one <hi>Freeman</hi> to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted, or wantonly injured in his liberty, ſo far as by your means it may be prevented.</p>
            <p>THUS animated and thus acting—We may then SING with the prophet—</p>
            <p>
               <q>Fear not O land! be glad and rejoice, for the Lord will do great things. Be not afraid, ye beaſt of the field, for the

paſtures of the wilderneſs do ſpring—The tree beareth her fruit—the fig-tree and the vine yield their fruit.</q>
            </p>
            <p>THUS animated and thus acting—we may likewiſe PRAY with the prophet—</p>
            <p>
               <q>O LORD be gracious unto us—we have waited for thee. Be thou our arm every morning, our ſalvation alſo in time of trouble. Some truſt in chariots and ſome in horſes, but we will remember the name of the Lord our God—O thou hope of Iſrael, the Saviour thereof in time of need—thou art in the midſt of us and we are called by thy name—LEAVE US NOT. Give us <hi>one</hi> heart and <hi>one</hi> way, that we may fear thee for ever, for the good of ourſelves and our children after us—We look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health, but behold we are in trouble—Yet will we truſt in the Lord for ever; for in the Lord Jehovah is everlaſting ſtrength—He will yet bind up the broken-hearted, and comfort thoſe that mourn</q>
—even ſo, oh our God, do thou comfort and relieve them, that ſo the bones which thou has broken may yet rejoice. Inſpire us with a high and commanding ſenſe of the value of our conſtitutional rights! may a ſpirit of wiſdom and virtue be poured down upon us all; and may our Repreſentatives, thoſe who are delegated to <hi>deviſe</hi> and appointed to <hi>execute</hi> public mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, be directed to ſuch, as thou in thy ſovereign goodneſs ſhall be pleaſed to render effectual for the ſalvation of a great empire, and re-uniting all its members in one ſacred bond of harmony and public happineſs! Grant this, oh Father, for thy Son Jeſus Chriſt's ſake; to whom, with thee and the holy Spirit, one God, be Glory, Honour and Power now and forever! AMEN.</p>
