            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>WAS it then reſerved for a Stranger to your Perſons, and your Altars, to addreſs you on this happy Reſtoration of your public Worſhip? This ſolemn Re eſtabliſhment of your Religious Aſſemblies? Was it to have been the good Fortune of One, to whom you were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known, but by your Sufferings, to be among the firſt of the Miniſters of God, to bring the Comfort and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of his Word to an afflicted and perſecuted People? To tell them, that he has not forgotten <hi>his loving Kindneſſeſs of old,</hi>—that however he ſeemed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to <hi>chaſten them in his Diſpleaſure; to caſt off his Altar and abhor his Sanctuary; to cauſe the ſolemn Feaſts and Sabbaths to be forgotten, and, in the Indignation of his Wrath, to reject the King and the Prieſt</hi>—that how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he ſuffers <hi>their City to be left deſolate and broken down, and every Houſe ſhut up, ſo that no Man may come in:</hi> yet that he will <hi>return again in his Mercy, in his appointed Time, to have Compaſſion upon his afflicted, to comfort his oppreſſed,</hi> and to <hi>bring them again every Man to his Heritage, and every Man to his Land; to ſay to the Priſoners, Go forth, and to them that are in Darkneſs, Shew yourſelves; to reſtore their Princes as at the Firſt, and their Counſellors as at the Beginning, and again to give them Prieſts according to his Heart?</hi> Let it be my firſt Care to bleſs his holy Name for having per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:043111_0003_101CCC3585FA4DD0"/>
me to join with your returning Clergy in the Diſcharge of this pleaſing Office. They alſo will add their Praiſes to mine.—You, my Brethren, will not be wanting in Gratitude and Thankfulneſs to the God of your Redemption, and the united Voice of <hi>Prieſts</hi> and <hi>People</hi> will be—<hi>It is good that a Man ſhould both hope, and quietly wait for the Salvation of the Lord</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His Ways are inſcrutable, but his Goodneſs certain and without Bounds.</p>
            <p>WHO that was Witneſs of the cruel and diſaſtrous Deed of the Night before laſt, could promiſe himſelf, that you ſhould be aſſembled this Day in the Houſe of God, to praiſe him for your wonderful Deliverance? Who could have hoped that this Temple would remain a Monument of the returning Favour of Heaven, amidſt the Horror of the Ruins through which you muſt have paſſed to approach it? Which of you could have ſaid to himſelf, that he ſhould ſee theſe Doors opened once more for the Reception of the Faithful, <hi>tho' as yet but as the Shaking of an Olive Tree, and the Gleaning Grapes when the Vintage is done?</hi> Or hear theſe Walls, ſo long ſilent and unfrequented, filled again with the Praiſes of him, to whoſe Name you had raiſed them? Is not this the Lord's Doing? Is not this our God for <hi>whom we have waited? We have waited for him, he hath ſaved us, and we will be glad and rejoice in his Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>SUFFER me, however, to check for a Moment, the Ferment which theſe different Senſations of Joy and Grief, ſo rapidly ſucceeding each other within theſe few Days paſt, muſt naturally have raiſed in your Breaſts. When the Heart, long oppreſſed, and cloſed in Affliction, is ſuddenly opened to the Impreſſions of Joy, only to be overwhelmed as ſuddenly with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional Weight of Sorrow and Diſmay, the Tumult within muſt be too violent to leave much Room for calm and uſeful Reflections. It ſhall therefore be my Buſineſs
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:043111_0004_101CCC03DCC82A00"/>
to endeavour to ſuggeſt ſuch Thoughts as appear ſuitable to this extraordinory Occaſion, and to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late your preſent Affections, in a Manner that beſt becomes the Diſciples of Chriſt.—This has never been, and I am confident never will be, the Pulpit of Contention or Strife. No <hi>Prophets, propheſying Lies in the Name of the Lord who ſent them not,</hi> ſhall ever turn it into a Stage for Sedition. The Words of Truth and Life will never be perverted here in promoting Violence and Bloodſhed, under Pretence of conſulting the Intereſts of the God of Peace; to cauſe the Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion of the lowly, mild and meek Jeſus to ſpeak the Language of Ambition, Slaughter and Revenge; or to conſecrate and deliver out in his Name, the Sword that is to be plunged by his Followers into each others Breaſts. Thanks be to the Lord, <hi>we have not ſo learned Chriſt.</hi> We will neither abuſe his Mercy, and long Forbearance ourſelves, by thus daring to proſtitute his awful Name; nor ſhall we preſume to deal out the Bolts of his Vengeance againſt others, whom his Juſtice may arraign as guilty of ſuch Profanation.—I there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore repeat it again, our only Buſineſs will be to ſuggeſt ſuch Reflections as ſhould engage the Minds of Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians on this Occaſion, to exhort you to turn your Thoughts to yourſelves; to conſider the Redemption that has been wrought in your Favour, and the Diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions with which you ſhould receive theſe Inſtances of the Divine Mercies.</p>
            <p>THE firſt Conſideration that ariſes from the Subject, is the grateful Senſe you ſhould entertain of the Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of God.</p>
            <p>THE immediate Impreſſions of Gratitude for preſent Benefits are ſtrong, lively and affecting. We feel them with Warmth; we expreſs them with Rapture—But it happens too frequently that we enjoy them with In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>difference, and by Degrees totally forget the gracious Hand that conferred them. While we are in Danger,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:043111_0005_101CCC370E09F2C8"/>
and Fear is upon us, we <hi>call upon the Name of the Lord</hi>: Our Sins and Tranſgreſſions affect us in their Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; and our future Obedience, Fidelity, and Gratitude, are fervently pledged in the Hopes of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Protection and Relief. But when the firſt Senſe of our Delivery is paſt, when our Enemies are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and the Danger removed, we are too apt to forget the Reſolutions we formed in the Hour of Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtreſs; our former Paſſions and evil Habits too fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently return with our former Security. The God of our Salvation is forgotten, and repayed with Ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, Neglect and Diſobedience.</p>
            <p>THE Conduct of Individuals is, generally ſpeaking, the Conduct of the Community. Ingratitude for Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours, tho' a Diſgrace to our Nature, is but too com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon in the private Intercourſes of Life; nor are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances leſs frequent of the ungrateful Returns which Nations have made for public Benefits confered upon them. The odious Vice, in either Caſe, receives its Aggravation in Proportion to the Mercies we have experienced, the Favours we have been bleſſed with, and the Character of our Benefactor: But ſhould it extend to that Benificent Power, in whom we move, and have our being, and rob him of the return he challenges from his Creatures for his boundleſs Mercy and Love, it then aſſumes its moſt deformed Shape: It then receives its utmoſt Weight and Accumulation of Guilt.</p>
            <p>ALL that is ſacred or dear upon Earth—your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, your civil Rights and Liberties, the Enjoyment of your Property, the Freedom of your Perſons, the Worſhip of your God, the Comfort of the Sacraments, the Preſence and Exhortation of your Miniſters—all that you poſſeſſed, and gloried in as Britiſh Subjects and as Chriſtians, wreſted from you by Violence and Oppreſſion, while <hi>the Shepherds were ſmitten and the Sheep of the Flock ſcattered abroad</hi>—all theſe Bleſſings,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:043111_0006_101CCC0565E92788"/>
valuable ſurely, if there be any ſo on this Side the Grave, and the dearer to you now for having been ſo cruelly deprived of them, hath your God begun to reſtore to you in this your Day; and with his ſtretched-out Arm, in a Manner viſible to every Eye, brought you back to a Proſpect of happier Days, and placed you again under the protecting Care of the ancient Guardians of your Religion and Liberty. And can it be poſſible that you ſhould ever ſuffer the Remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of the divine Mercies, thus extended to you, to be blotted out from your Minds? It were doing wrong to thoſe who have ſuffered with the Fortitude and Perſeverance, the Loyalty and Attachment to their Sovereign, which have diſtinguiſhed the Friends of Government in this Colony, even to ſuppoſe it. And I ſhould hope that they who have endured ſo long and painful a Trial, rather than renounce their Loyalty, or the religious Principles on which that Loyalty is chiefly founded, will never hereafter be guilty of any Action, or purſue any Conduct, that can diſgrace them as good Subjects, or as virtuous Chriſtians.</p>
            <p>BUT while I thus exhort you to perſevere in your grateful Acknowledgments to the God of your Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption, let me not neglect a Point of equal Import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to you, equally acceptable to him. The Uſe, which in his gracious Providence he deſigns we ſhould make of the Miſconduct of others, or of the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which our Sins may have brought on ourſelves, is frequently pointed out in the Scriptures. His Viſitations he ſets up as Marks to caution us againſt the Rocks and Shelves on which Folly and Vice have already cauſed ſo many to be wrecked; and wilfully to run upon them is to ſlight the divine Mercy—is an Aggravation of all our former Guilt, and juſtly expoſes us to ſtill more ſevere Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of the Wrath of Heaven. The Pſalmiſt, enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rating the various Calamities inflicted on the Iſraelites for their Incredulity and Diſobedience, mentions, as a Source of additional Miſeries to this ſtiff-necked Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:043111_0007_101CCC3896987068"/>
that they neglected to profit by their own fatal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, or the dreadful Examples they daily ſaw before their Eyes, of the Lord's Indignation. They refuſed to humble themſelves beneath the divine Chaſtiſement, but continued to provoke their Deliverer by freſh Proofs of Ingratitude. <hi>The Wrath of God came upon them, and ſmote down the choſen Men of Iſrael; for all this they ſinned ſtill—therefore their Days did he conſume in Vanity, and their Years in Troubles.</hi> Entering into theſe Views, my Brethren, conſider with me the Steps that have led your Country into its preſent Calamities—you will be the better enabled to check them in future, at leaſt to decline and avoid them yourſelves.—The Exceſſes of others will teach you a Leſſon of Prudence and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration to regulate your own Conduct.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>MY Son, fear thou the Lord and the King, and med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle not with them that are given to change</hi>—was the excellent Rule laid down by the wiſeſt of Men. Againſt thoſe who tranſgreſs it, he denounces a ſudden and inevitable Deſtruction. Whatever they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe themſelves,—However they may ſeem to proſper for a Time, Ruin, infallible Ruin, awaits them when leaſt they expect it; nor is it poſſible to foreſee the Miſeries they may entail on themſelves and their Deſcendants—"<hi>their Calamity ſhall riſe ſuddenly; and who knoweth the Ruin of them both?</hi> The Words are remarkable, but they are dictated by Wiſdom, and ſupported by Experience. It has happened from your former proſperous State, and the preſent Calamities of this Province, from which <hi>you</hi> happily begin to reſpire, that no Nation upon Earth can form a better Judgment upon this important Queſtion than your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and I have before me, in this Aſſembly, a living Example to which alone I need refer.</p>
            <p>CALL then to Mind the happy and proſperous Days this Colony enjoyed, when Loyalty to your Sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign, Affection for the Conſtitution of your parent
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:043111_0008_101CCC08306DA4E0"/>
State, and Obedience to the Laws you enjoyed under its Protection, diſtinguiſhed it above all the other Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces of America. Your Condition was then an Object of Envy to Nations corrupted by the Refine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Luxury. Peace was in your Dwellings, Plenty in your Streets—Induſtry diffuſed her Bleſſings through your Fields with an increaſing Profuſion, giving Life to all the uſeful Arts, and nurturing them daily into Maturity and Perfection. The Produce of your Country flowed from your Port in a conſtant uninterrupted Stream, and you received in Return the Conveniencies and Comforts of Life, and all the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gancies which a free and extenſive Commerce can beſtow on a prudent and contented People. A friendly, hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitable, and ſocial Intercourſe united you together as the Members of one Family, to the Admiration and Delight of Strangers who reſided among you—you were bleſſed beyond the uſual Lot of Men—Happy, completely ſo, did you but know how to value your Happineſs, and to preſerve it!</p>
            <p>HOW different the Scene to which I muſt call off your Attention! what a Change of Proſpect will the Reverſe exhibit! where ſhall we ſeek for that Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of Happineſs which you could boaſt, when every Man ſat under his own Vine, and eat his Bread with Chearfulneſs? Alas! Is it not waſted all, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed in viſionary Schemes, empty and fanciful as the Dreams of the Morning! Is it not ſquandered away in lawleſs and ungrateful Attempts, repugnant to every Principle divine and human? In Purſuits which plain Senſe and Reaſon condemn, and at which even the Impulſes of Nature muſt recoil? Peace, frightened from the Seats where once ſhe loved to dwell, long ſince took her Flight from among you. Diſſentions, party Rage, public Enmities, and private Animoſities, uſurped her Place, and brought with them a horrid Train of mutual Fears, Diſtruſts, and endleſs Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies. By theſe were the Confidence and Harmony
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:043111_0009_101CCC3A218EF528"/>
of all ſocial Intercourſe deſtroyed; by theſe were the Bands of Love and Friendſhip torn aſunder; by theſe were even the Ties of Conſanguinity and Nature diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved. Self-intereſt, Self-preſervation, the Welfare of Poſterity, Principles ingrafted in the human Mind by the benificent Creator, were all confounded and loſt in this dark and diſmal Night of Confuſion, Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, and Licentiouſneſs. See Induſtry perverted from its uſeful Purpoſes, and employed in improving the Arts of Deſtruction. Your <hi>Plough-Shears</hi> it turned into <hi>Swords,</hi> and your <hi>Pruning-Hocks</hi> into <hi>Spears,</hi> the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe of the Bleſſing pronounced by <hi>Iſaiah.</hi> See your Fields once cultivated, the Gardens of America, laid waſte and turned into licentious Encampments and the deſolating Scenes of War;—ſee your Commerce, your envied Commerce, deſtroyed, your Property ſeized and diſſipated in Support of the Cauſe you abhored—your Liberties deſpiſed and trodden under Foot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and an arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Multitude inſulting over your Miſeries, turned looſe upon your Poſſeſſions, and rioting in your Subſtance. In vain you looked up to Juſtice for Support—her Seats were overthrown, and trampled in the Duſt; her Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers diſperſed, and the People abandoned to every wild Impulſe of Humour and Paſſion, without Laws, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Magiſtrates, without Form of Government. In ſhort, too well might we apply to you the Words of Jeremiah—<hi>If you went forth into the Fields, behold the Slain with the Sword; if you entered into the City, behold ſhe that was full of Inhabitants, and Princeſs among the Provinces, ſitting ſolitary, and become as a diſconſolate,</hi> childleſs <hi>Widow.—Both the Prophet and the Prieſt went about in a Land they knew not—your Friends dealt treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erouſly with you, and became your Enemies, while you were gone into Captivity, becauſe of Affliction, and becauſe of great Servitude.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To what Cauſes are we to attribute this deplorable Change? Whence is it that you can ſay to yourſelves, Such was the Happineſs we once could boaſt; ſuch the melancholy Reverſe we have experienced! I have
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:043111_0010_101CCC0AD5C86A80"/>
heard ſome attribute it to the Imperfection of human Nature, incapable of enjoying a durable State of Proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and oftentimes moſt diſcontented, when bleſſed with the greateſt Cauſe of Content. But I ſhall ſearch for it among the Sources of the Decay and Fall of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the Scriptures of God point out to me. Warranted by theſe, I ſhall not heſitate to aſſert, that if this Province had continued <hi>to fear the Lord, and the King, and had not meddled with thoſe who are given to change</hi>; the Tempeſt would have ſpent its Rage at a Diſtance from you, and Peace, Induſtry, and Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would ſtill have bleſſed your Dwellings, as they did of old. You, indeed, my Friends, ſeem to have been well convinced of this Truth. The Struggle you maintained was vigorous, and for ſome Time ſucceſsful —But all were not animated with your Spirit. The Love of Novelty—or whatever other Cauſes the Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of Darkneſs beſt can tell—for it is impoſſible to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for ſuch Folly and Madneſs on any known Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples—ſeduced too many from their Allegiance to their Sovereign, and their former happy Attachment to the Britiſh Conſtitution; and theſe ancient Barriers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing once removed, all the Diſorders that have well nigh overthrown your Country, broke in upon you, and the Depreſſion of your Religion, for the Time, follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of Courſe. So true it is, that when Reſtleſsneſs and Diſcontent once poſſeſs the Mind, it is impoſſible to foreſee to what Extremes a Rage for Innovation, and a Paſſion for Change, will tranſport their Votaries. They are like the <hi>unclean Spirit</hi> mentioned in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, always on the Wing, <hi>ſeeking</hi> a Place of <hi>Reſt,</hi> but <hi>never finding it.</hi> Exceſſes, at which Men would have ſhuddered at their firſt ſetting out, <hi>ſwept clean,</hi> and placed in a deluſive Point of View by Faction and Party, loſe their Deformity, and daily make Way for other Exceſſes ſtill more criminal, ſtill more enormous. Theſe diſſatisfied <hi>Spirits take to themſelves other Spirits more wicked than themſelves, and the laſt State of theſe Men becomes worſe than the firſt.</hi> I need not make the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication

—It is but too manifeſt—you have already done it for me.</p>
            <p>I HAVE ſaid that when too many of this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince ſuffered themſelves to be ſeduced from their Allegiance to their Sovereign, and their former happy Attachment to the Britiſh Conſtitution, the Depreſſion of your Religion followed of Courſe—Let me not be miſunderſtood—I mean not to engage in an invidious Point of Controverſy, which has often been carried to ſuch fatal Lengths. Religious Diſputes obtrude them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves too frequently into Subjects of mere political Concern, and ſerve no other End than to widen Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and encreaſe Animoſities, which the Holy Syſtem, the Intereſts of which they would ſeem to ſupport, would wiſh to allay forever. Warmed with Zeal for their parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Tenets, however uneſſentially differing from each other, the Paſſions of the Diſputants work themſelves into the Controverſy, and we are apt to aſcribe their raſh and intemperate Dictates to that Syſtem, the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of which they have embraced. There is alſo another Prejudice, which is apt to lead us aſtray in this important Matter. As in the different Forms of Government, at preſent eſtabliſhed throughout the Chriſtian World, Religion is fundamentally connected with their civil and political Inſtitutes; we generally conſider them as going Hand in Hand, and charge the Creed of each particular Sect with the political Errors and Diſorders of its Profeſſors. A Church there is, indeed, whoſe Principles have been proved by fatal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience to be ſo eſſentially inconſiſtent with every No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of free and rational Government, ſo infallibly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troductive of a double Slavery, forging Chains both for the Body and Mind, that it has been deſervedly branded with this foul Imputation, and juſtly abhorred by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions jealous of their Liberties. But that among Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Churches, ſuch a Charge ſhould be urged and retorted by each other, with ſo much Virulence and Animoſity, hath long been a Cauſe of Grief to every
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:043111_0012_101CCC0D8CBF9C60"/>
Well-wiſher of the Reformed Religion, and a great Subject of Triumph to their common Enemies, both at home and abroad. Let me not attempt to enlarge the Breach, or be guilty of an Error, which I condemn in others. I ſhall only obſerve, that in every Age, in every State, there are Men of depraved Hearts, who put on Religion as a Cloak to cover their ſiniſter Views; or uſe it as a political Tool to work upon the Minds of the Weak, and uninſtructed, and all, whoſe Zeal without Knowledge renders them an eaſy Prey to the Arts of Seducers. Theſe, like the Lame and Impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent at the Pool of Betheſda, watch the Troubling of the Waters, that they may be the firſt to take Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage of the public Commotions, and on the Ruins of the Peace and Happineſs of their Country, pave the Way to their own Advancement: Men, who declaim againſt every Power, but that which they have them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves uſurped; to whom the Pretence of the public Good, and the Intereſts of their Country, is as eaſy as that of Religion; and who aſſume both in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon with every reſtleſs Malecontent, who in every Age, under every Government, has deſtroyed the Peace of the Chriſtian World.</p>
            <p>FROM what Cauſes <hi>your</hi> Sufferings may have origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated, this is not the Time, nor the Place to conſider. Too certain it is, that they have now riſen to ſuch a Height of Aggravation, as needs no Words to repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to you—You feel it beyond the Energy of Words. The ſmart of recent Wrongs, and former Injuries, ſpeaks a Language which thoſe who ſympathize with you in your Sufferings, can never adopt. Whatever the Principles of your Perſecutors may be, their unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting Malice is but too notorious; and they have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all their former Exceſſes, a Deed of Atrociouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs which muſt open the Eyes of the moſt infatuated— muſt totally alienate even the ſmall Numbers, who may have hitherto been deluded into ſome favourable Opinion of their Cauſe. To what a Scene were you
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:043111_0013_101CCC4015759B48"/>
Witneſſes the Night before laſt! When juſt eſcaped from the Storm, and imagining yourſelves arrived at a Port of Reſt; labouring to collect together the ſmall Remains of your Fortune that had eſcaped the general Wreck; meeting once more and embracing, after ſo long and painful a Separation, the Objects of your tendereſt Affection, or ſolacing yourſelves with the Hopes of being ſpeedily re-united to thoſe who were yet detained in Bondage from you; congratulating your Friends on your mutual Deliverance, and the Proſpect that was opening to you of returning Peace, Quiet and Security—In this Dawn of your Hopes and Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to awake at the Midnight Hour and find your City in Flames; to ſee your All periſhing before your Eyes, and to know that your Deſtroyers were ſecretly among you, ſpreading the Ruin, and exulting in the Succeſs of their infernal Scheme!</p>
            <p>THIS was not the ſudden Act of a vanquiſhed and flying Enemy, perpetrated in the peeviſh Moment of Diſappointment and Defeat, or contrived to favour their Eſcape. No,—ſeveral Days had elapſed ſince their Flight, and Quiet ſeemed to have reviſited you under the Banner of your Deliverers. Even the baſe Incendiaries returned among you, wearing the Maſk of Peace. We hoped that they had repented of their Exceſſes—had been convinced of their Folly and Mad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and meant to embrace the profered Clemency of their Sovereign, who was willing to forget the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful Revolt againſt his Authority, their Contempt of his Crown and Government, and the Inſults of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to his Perſon. But they cried, <hi>Peace, Peace, when there was no Peace.</hi> The Blow they were medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating was the more dangerous from its being thus con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed—they gloried in ſtriking it home, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, under Heaven, but the Activity of your En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh Friends, could have prevented the whole City's falling a Victim to their determined Malice. Yes, my Friends, ye were Witneſſes of it.—Ye ſaw the treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erous Adherents of theſe pretended Guardians of your
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:043111_0014_101CCC104E7D0F88"/>
Rights and Poſſeſſions, who came to reſcue you from Tyranny and Oppreſſion, armed with Firebrands, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Cover of the Darkneſs wrapping your City in Flames —Ye ſaw the brave and generous Servants of your King, —that King, whom you have ſo often heard repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as a Tyrant, who ſends forth his Fleets and Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to enſlave, ravage, deſtroy,—flying to the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of their fellow Subjects, in the Midſt of the Flames, at the Hazard of their Lives, exerting every Nerve to preſerve your Dwellings and Poſſeſſions, and tearing from the Hands of the dark Incendiaries the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments they had prepared for your Deſtruction. Had it pleaſed Heaven, that the Succeſs could have anſwered their Zeal, ſo many Families once bleſſed with Comfort and Affluence, would not have been turned out on the World, naked, helpleſs, and ſtripped of their All.— The Seminary of indigent Merit, where Poverty found a Reſource againſt Ignorance, and where Charity re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed Thouſands from Idleneſs and Diſſipation to Virtue and Induſtry, would yet have ſtood.<note n="*" place="bottom">In the Fire of Saturday, Sept. 21, a Thouſand Houſes, nearly One Fourth of the City, were laid in Aſhes. Trinity Church, the public Charity School, the Rector's Houſe, and a Lutheran Chapel, were among the Buildings that were conſumed.—The Loſs ſuſtained in Houſes, &amp;c. by the Corporation of Trinity Church, amounts, at a moderate Computation, to THIRTY THOUSAND POUNDS, New-York Currency.</note> The Manſion of your worthy and reverend Miniſter, whoſe Abſence you ſtill regret, and the Poſſeſſions appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated for the Support of your Clergy, would not have periſhed, and added to the Diſtreſſes they have already ſuffered on your Account and their own.—But <hi>ye ſmitten and afflicted,</hi> who beheld your <hi>Deſtruction coming</hi> on you <hi>like a Whirlwind,</hi> and ſaw the Work of Ages, the Fruits of your own Induſtry, and the Labour of your Anceſtors, ſwept off in the Space of a Moment, whither could ye have fled from the Rage of your Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies? Not even the Temples of the Lord were ſacred from their Fury—his Altars could afford you no Sanctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary. The Mother of your Churches, the Ornament of your Worſhip, the firſt Edifice which the Piety of your

Some Child of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition claimed to himſelf the Merit of this daring Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crilege, and involved the ancient and venerable Pile in the ſame Ruin with which they deſigned to extirpate all the Monuments of your Religion, every Veſtige of your ancient Splendor and Glory.</p>
            <p>IN this Scene of univerſal Danger and Diſtreſs, to what can the Miniſters of God exhort you? Ill ſhould we know <hi>what Manner of Spirit we were of,</hi> if we ſuffered any Expreſſions, that may have fallen from us, to be interpreted into a Breach of Charity, the Crown of Chriſtian Virtues; or into a Deſign of ſharpening the Virulence of Party, or encreaſing Animoſities that have already too fatally deſtroyed <hi>the Peace</hi> of your <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi> To miniſter ſome Conſolation in your Sufferings, as becometh the Teachers of the Goſpel, who muſt be unworthy indeed of the Character they bear, not to feel for the Afflictions of their Brethren, who look to them for Comfort and Inſtruction; to ſet before you <hi>the loving Kindneſſes of the Lord,</hi> and the Redemption he hath wrought in your Favour, and to exhort you to make every becoming Return for his Mercies and Love; to point out to you, and warn you againſt the Abuſes that have brought Ruin upon your Country—this has been our only Aim.—If we have ſucceeded, all our Wiſhes are ſatisfied, and we ſhall have the Conſolation to think that you will ſanctify this Day, as becometh Chriſtians—by Prayer and Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving; by Repentance for paſt Sins, and Reſolutions of an Amendment of Life; by practiſing the <hi>Duties</hi> of that Religion, for the <hi>Intereſts</hi> of which you have mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted ſuch Zeal and Attachment; by laying aſide all Malice, Hatred, and Deſire of Revenge; by commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting your Cauſe to the Juſtice of God, and waiting with Reſignation for the further Accompliſhment of his gracious Deſigns. He who can <hi>ſtill the raging of the
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:043111_0016_101CCC1462E9BE80"/>
Seas,</hi> knows beſt how to reſtore Peace and Tranquility to your diſtracted Country. May he correct the Hearts, and enlighten the Underſtandings of your infatuated Brethren, who ſtill refuſe to contribute their Endeavours towards healing theſe unhappy Diſputes. And while their Example proves a Warning to you,—while, in their Conduct, you conſider the Exceſſes to which thoſe may be tranſported, who once paſs the ancient Bounds of lawful and ſettled Government, may God give you Grace to attach yourſelves the more firmly to our happy Conſtitution both in Church and State.</p>
            <p>HUMBLY, and with all due proſtration of Heart, I ſhall venture to affirm that your Cauſe is his own. It is the Cauſe of Peace, Loyalty, and ſound Reaſon, expoſed to the Attempts of miſguided Men, whom he ſeems to have given over to a Blindneſs of Heart that hurries them into all the Violence and Artifice of Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Frenzy and Rebellion. Fear not then, my Friends, but in his own Time <hi>his Wiſdom will order all Things ſweetly.</hi> In the mean Time, learn to reſign yourſelves to whatever Means he may be pleaſed to employ for that End, and humble yourſelves beneath his chaſtiſing, but fatherly Hand. Would to God I could ſay that the Danger were paſt! But Treachery perhaps, ſtill lurketh amongſt you. Let every Man, therefore, be careful and vigilant. Nature requires, and Religion approves, that we ſhould make Uſe of the Means, which Providence hath put into our Power for our Protection and Safety. But let this be your chief Dependance, that he <hi>who is with you, is</hi> greater <hi>than they</hi> who are againſt you.—He from whom alone your Safety can come, <hi>neither ſlumbers nor ſleeps.</hi> Tho' your Enemies may hope <hi>that the Darkneſs ſhall cover them, the Darkneſs is no darkneſs with Him.</hi> He will not let them <hi>have their Deſire,</hi> nor their <hi>miſchievous Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination proſper.</hi> Let the Senſe of the common Danger to which you are expoſed, and the Fellowſhip of your paſt Sufferings, ſtrengthen the Ties of Charity
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:043111_0017_101CCC4805E0BAF0"/>
between you, and bind you together as Friends and Brethren. Let a Reciprocration of Kindneſs and Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity diſtinguiſh you in this Seaſon of Diſtreſs, to ſoften the Rigour of each others Sufferings and lighten the univerſal Burthen of Affliction. Be of one Heart, and one Mind, cleave together,—commend yourſelves to the Protection of God, and doubt not but he will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete the Work he hath already ſo graciouſly begun. And when he <hi>ſhall have plucked out</hi> all Strife and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity from <hi>among</hi> you, fear not but he will <hi>return, and have Compaſſion upon you, and bring you again every Man to his Heritage, and every Man to his Land.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I MUST not finiſh as if I meant to diſappoint your Expectations, and not adopt a Concluſion which I am convinced you have already anticipated. The Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legiance they had ſworn to their lawful Sovereign, and an affectionate Attachment to his virtuous Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, compelled your Clergy to ſhut theſe Doors, rather than omit the dutiful Addreſſes, which the Church enjoins them daily to offer to Heaven for his Safety. Let us therefore conclude the Service of this Day, when the Freedom of your Worſhip is reſtored to you, by uniting together with one Heart, and one Voice; to implore the divine Favour and Protection for our Sovereign Lord, King George;—that God would be pleaſed to give him length of Days, and encreaſe of Happineſs—to proſper all his Undertakings for the good of his People, and to bleſs him with what his Actions prove, and his Words aſſert to be the
