            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p n="1">1.

4. Whether bigotry be not naturally pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of intolerance, and whether higotry and intolerance in <hi>politics</hi> be not as abſurd in reaſon, as mean in their nature, and as deſtructive to ſociety, as bigotry and intole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in matters of religion?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Whether there can be a greater proof of bigotry, either in religion or politics, than an obſtinate reſolution to hear or ſee nothing that is offered on the ſubject in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by perſons who are ſuppoſed to be of different ſentiments?</p>
            <p n="6">6. Whether ſuch a reſolution be not alſo a proof, that a man in <hi>conſcious</hi> of the <hi>weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of his cauſe, and <hi>afraid</hi> of the force of thoſe arguments which may be offered againſt him?</p>

            <p n="13">13. Whether ſome degree of reſpect be not always due from inferiors to ſuperiors, and eſpecially from children to parents; and whether the refuſal of this on any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, be not a violation of the general laws of ſociety, to ſay nothing here of the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations of religion and morality?</p>

Whether what conſtitutes right con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct among men, does not conſtitute right conduct among ſocieties, or bodies of men, with regard to one another; and whether the latter can be leſs criminal, or their conduct leſs diſguſting and ſhocking to the genuine feelings of the <hi>moral ſenſe,</hi> when they tranſgreſs the common rule of duty, than the former?</p>

15. Whether <hi>Great-Britain</hi> bears not a relation to theſe colonies, ſimilar to that of a parent to children; and whether any parent can put up with ſuch diſreſpectful and abuſive treatment from children, as <hi>Great-Britain</hi> has lately received from her colonies?</p>
            <p n="16">16. Whether all true friends to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, with whatever zeal they may think themſelves bound to aſſert and ſupport their claim, ought not, from a regard both to duty and ſafety, on every proper occaſion, to expreſs their diſapprobation of a beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, which is indecent and ſhameful in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and which has brought upon the <hi>Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans</hi> the indignation of a power, which the proudeſt nation in <hi>Europe</hi> reveres, and under whoſe reſentments the ſtrongeſt would tremble?</p>
            <p n="17">17. Whether it be a mark either of wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom or candour to believe, declare, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinuate, that <hi>Great-Britain</hi> has acted alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether from wrong motives, and the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies altogether from right ones?</p>
            <p n="18">18. Whether there can be any medium between being ſubjects and not ſubjects; and whether, if the <hi>Americans</hi> be not <hi>Britiſh</hi>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:013222_0007_0F90462C10BEED20"/>
ſubjects, they are not, with regard to <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> aliens and foreigners?</p>

            <p n="20">20. Whether the ſupreme legiſlative au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of every nation does not neceſſarily extend to all the dominions of that nation; and whether any place, to which this au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority does not extend, can juſtly be ſaid to be a part of its dominions?</p>
            <p n="21">21. Whether, in conſequence of a general grant, particular claims, founded upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial conſtructions and remote inferences, which are contrary to the apparent intereſt and deſign of the granter, can be valid, either in law or in equity?</p>

Whether any <hi>direct</hi> evidence has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto appeared in favour of the exemption for which the colonies contend; and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it does not concern the managers of their cauſe, previouſly to any other ſteps, to produce <hi>ſuch</hi> evidence in ſupport of their claim?</p>

23. Whether there be any proof or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability, that, when the firſt grants of land in <hi>America</hi> were made by the <hi>Britiſh</hi> crown to <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubjects, it was intended by the former, or underſtood by the latter, that they were to be no longer ſubject to the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme legiſlative authority of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> nation?</p>

            <p n="27">27. Whether a right in the colonies to chooſe which laws of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> they will obey, and which they will diſobey, would leave any obligation to obedience at all?</p>

            <p n="30">30. Whether there has ever been a time, in which the colonies appear to have thought, that the nation had not a full and compleat right of juriſdiction over them, till about the year 1764?</p>
            <p n="31">31. Whether more was expreſsly granted or meant to be granted, by charter to any of the colonies, than authority for regulating reſpectively their own <hi>police;</hi> and whether ſuch an authority, granted for the purpoſe of internal regulation and government, can be fairly conſtrued to exempt any ſociety, or incorporated body whatever, from the ſupreme legiſlative power of that nation, to which it belongs?</p>

                  <p>The very reſpectable author of a leading pamphlet in thoſe times, entitled, <hi>Conſiderations on the propriety of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing taxes,</hi> &amp;c. declares his opinion in the following words. <q>The ſubordination of the colonies, and the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority of the parliament to preſerve it, have been fully acknowledged. Not only the welfare, but perhaps the exiſtence of the mother country, as an independent king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, may depend upon her trade and navigation, and theſe (may depend) ſo far upon her intercourſe with the colonies, that, if it ſhould be neglected, there would ſoon be an end to that commerce, whence her greateſt wealth is derived, and upon which her maritime power is principally founded. From theſe conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the right of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> parliament, to regulate the trade of the colonies, may be juſtly deduced; a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of it would contradict the admiſſion of the ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and of the authority to preſerve it; reſulting from the nature of the relation between the mother-country and her colonies. It is a common, and frequently <hi>the moſt proper method to regulate trade by duties on imports and exports.</hi> The authority of the mother-country to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the trade of the colonies being unqueſtionable, what regulations are moſt proper, are to be of courſe ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to the determination of the parliament; and if an <hi>incidental revenue</hi> ſhould be produced by ſuch regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, theſe are not therefore unwarrantable.</q>

                  <p>
                     <q>A right to impoſe an internal tax on the colonies, without their coment, <hi>for the ſingle purpoſe of a revenue,</hi> is denied; a right to regulate their trade. <hi>without their conſent,</hi> is admitted. The impoſition of a duty may, in ſome inſtances, be the <hi>proper</hi> regulation. If the claims of the mother-country and the colonies ſhould ſeem on ſuch an occaſion to interfere, and the point of right to be doubtful (which I take to be otherwiſe) it is eaſy to gueſs that the determination will be on the ſide of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and that the inferior will be conſtrained to ſubmit.</q>
