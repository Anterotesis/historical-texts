            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE preſent unuſual and gloomy appearance of the place <note n="*" place="bottom">In alluſion to the pulpit hung with mourning on this occaſion.</note> in which I now ſtand, may ſeem the natural preſage of a diſcourſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete with gloomy ideas, with lamentation and mourning. But yet methinks this is a ſeaſon adapted to awaken various, and even contrary paſſions in our breaſts; a ſeaſon wherein we almoſt unavoida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly mingle ſome of the tears of joy with thoſe of ſorrow; and wherein wholly to indulge, or wholly to repreſs either of them, would hardly be innocent; at leaſt not very congruous. On one hand we juſtly mourn the death of an excellent king, whom every good Britiſh ſubject was habituated to conſider rather under the amiable and endearing character of a father, than the more awful one of a ſovereign. And where is the heart ſo hard, ſo unfeeling, ſo devoid of all ſentiment, as to remain untouch'd, unaffected, at the death of ſuch a king, the common father of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? What boſom does not heave? What eye is not ready to overflow, on ſo melancholy an occaſion?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:008925_0005_10303393847CE918"/>BUT, on the other hand, have we not cauſe for gratitude, that heaven ſpared him to us ſo long? and for joy, that his royal grandſon and ſucceſſor is peaceably aſcended the throne? And this at ſuch a mature age, and adorned with ſo many royal quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, as give us the reaſonable proſpect of ſitting under his ſhadow with great delight; and, in a Word, of enjoying under his reign the continuance of all thoſe numerous bleſſings, which we ſo long enjoyed under the auſpicious reign of his late majeſty. The ſame object has often both a bright and a dark ſide; and, by being turned round, gives relief, or even pleaſure, to the pained eye of the ſpectator. As our felicity is never pure and unallayed in this evil world; ſo neither is our ſorrow ever, or hardly ever, unmixed; but uſually attended with ſome circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which, being duly conſidered, may adminiſter comfort to us. This is our preſent caſe: That ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign hand which gave the wound to our hearts by the death of his late majeſty, has almoſt healed it the ſame hour, and turned our mourning into joy; or if not into joy, has at leaſt miniſtred the beſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation that the nature of the caſe would admit of. For the loſs of a good king cannot be any way ſo effectually made up, or remedied, as by another, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy to ſucceed him, reigning in his ſtead; eſpecially one deſcended, from him, and in whom he may be conſidered as, in ſome ſort, ſtill living and reigning. Such is the conſolation that gracious heaven affords to us, and to three kingdoms, at this ſeaſon of our common mourning. And both reaſon and religion as much require that we gracefully receive the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation offered, as that we humbly lay to heart that event of providence, by which we came to need it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:008925_0006_1030339622127D08"/>IT becomes us as men, and eſpecially as chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, on this occaſion to look up to the ſovereign ruler of the univerſe, who "removeth kings and ſetteth up kings", as ſeemeth good in his ſight. Him we are to conſider as the author of thoſe revoltuions, and other great changes, which take place from age to age in the kingdoms of this world; and ſhould make a religious improvement of the preſent diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of his providence towards us. It is with a view at aſſiſting you in ſo important a duty, that I have choſen the words juſt now read, for the ſubject of my diſcourſe at this time—"The moſt High ruleth in the kingdom of men." The words occur three ſeveral times in this fourth chapter of Daniel; which conſiſts of a manifeſto, or ſolemn declaration, which Nebuchadnezzar the great king of Babylon publiſhed "to all people, nations and languages"; and which the prophet, for the honor of God's name, thought proper, it ſeems, to preſerve intire with his own writings, to be tranſmitted to future gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Nebuchadnezzar is ſpoken of in ſcripture as one of the greateſt monarchs that ever lived in the world. "Thou, O king", ſaid Daniel to him, "art a king of kings; for the God of heaven hath given thee a kingdom, power, and ſtrength and glory. And whereſoever the children of men dwell, the beaſts of the field, and the fowls of heaven hath he delivered into thy hand <note n="†" place="bottom">Chap. II. ver. 37, 38.</note>". Prophane hiſtory ſpeaks of him conformably to this account <note n="‖" place="bottom">He is ſaid to have held in ſubjection Syria, Phenicia, Arabia and Egypt. "Strabo likewiſe aſſerts that this king among the Chaldeans was more celebrated than Hercules, and that he proceeded as far as the pillars of Hercules [near the ſtreights of Gibralter] and led his army out of Spain into Thrace and Pontus." Vid. Dr. Newton's XIIIth <hi>Diſſertation on Prophecy.</hi>
               </note>. He
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:008925_0007_10303399011CE1B0"/>was as proud and impious as he was great. And God ſeems to have raiſed him up as he did Pharaoh, that he might "ſhew his power in him, and that his name might be declared throughout all the earth". It ſeems that he was for a time much alarmed, and even convinced, by the miraculous deliverance of the three pious Jews from the fiery furnace, whom he had ordered to be caſt into it for not worſhipping the golden image which he had ſet up; and he made a decree, that no one ſhould ſpeak againſt the God whom theſe men worſhipped.<note n="*" place="bottom">Dan. C. III. v. 29.</note> But his heart, like Pharaoh's, reſumed its former hardneſs; and was ſo lifted up with pride, that God reſolved to humble him in a very ſignal manner. And the main deſign of his manifeſto, contained in this IVth Chapter of Daniel, is to declare to all the world the wonderful means by which God did this; by which he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced him of his ſupreme dominion, his power and providence, and the wiſdom and juſtice of all his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings with the children of men. So that this may be called the proclamation whereby that mighty, and once impious monarch, recognized God's univerſal dominion, as the King of kings and Lord of lords. "I thought it good"," ſays he, "to ſhew the ſigns and wonders that the high God hath wrought towards me. For how great are his ſigns? and how mighty are his wonders? His kingdom is an everlaſting king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom", &amp;c. He then proceeds particularly to relate what had happened to him; the aſtoniſhing ſigns by which God humbled his proud heart, and made him confeſs, that he indeed "ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomſoever he will." What theſe ſigns and wonders were, I now forbear particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to mention, leſt my diſcourſe ſhould be drawn out to too great a length. But in general, he had
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:008925_0008_1030339ADBFCD350"/>a remarkable dream, or viſion, wherein, under the ſimilitude of cutting down a mighty tree, was, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the prophet's interpretation, prefigured his own fall from his greatneſs, and his being driven from men. And when the king ſaid, "Is not this great Babylon that I have built for the houſe of the kingdom, by the might of my power, and for the honor of my majeſty? While the word was in the kings mouth, there fell a voice from heaven, ſaying, O king Nebuchadnezzar, to thee it is ſpoken, The kingdom is departed from thee," &amp;c. And "the ſame hour was the thing fulfilled upon Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar." Of which event we find the prophet afterwards giving the following account to his ſon Belſhazzar—"All people, nations and languages trembled and feared before him: whom he would he ſlew, and whom he would he kept alive, and whom he would he ſet up, and whom he would he put down. But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened in pride, he was depoſed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him: And he was driven from the ſons of men—till he knew that the moſt high God ruled in the kingdom of men, and that he appointeth over it whomſoever he will <note n="†" place="bottom">Chap. V. ver. 19, 20, 21.</note>."</p>
            <p>THUS wonderfully was this great king brought down, till at the end of the days appointed, he lift up his eyes to heaven, and his underſtanding re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned unto him. And he concludes his proclamation in the ſtrong and emphatical terms following, which diſcover an heart very deeply impreſt with what had befallen him for his former pride, tyranny and impiety —"Now I Nebuchadnezzar", ſays he, "praiſe, and extol, and honor the king of heaven, all whoſe works are truth, and his ways judgment; and thoſe that walk in pride he is able to abaſe".</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:008925_0009_1030339D79C17DF0"/>But to return; The words of the text may be conſidered as an intire, independent ſentence, tho' they indeed make but a part of one, as they ſtand in the ſeveral places where they occur in this chapter. In this light it is propoſed to conſider them; and they will, I ſuppoſe, be a proper introduction to ſome reflexions on the preſent occaſion, as they aſſert God's ſupreme dominion in and over the kingdoms of men.</p>
            <p>FOR the illuſtration of this ſubject, it is to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved firſt in general,</p>
            <p n="1">I. THAT all nations, all kingdoms, are in the hand of God, who has an original right, and abſolute pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er over them. He hath made of one blood all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for to dwell upon the face of the earth; and has the intire diſpoſal of them. The abſolute ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of God over all nations, is repreſented in very ſtrong and ſublime language by Nebuchadnezzar in this chapter, after his reaſon returned to him. "His kingdom", ſaith he, "is from generation to generation: And all the inhabitants of the earth are reputed as nothing; and he doeth according to his will in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of heaven, and among the inhabitants of the earth: and none can ſtay his hand, or ſay unto him, What doeſt thou?" The prophet Iſaiah expreſſeth himſelf upon this ſubject in language not leſs emphatical. "Behold, the nations are as a drop of the bucket", ſaith he, "and are counted as the ſmall duſt of the balance: behold, he taketh up the iſles as a very little thing — all nations before him are as nothing, and they are counted to him as leſs than nothing and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity". And a little after in the ſame chapter—"It is he that ſitteth upon the circle of the earth, and the inhabitants thereof are as graſshoppers; that ſtretcheth out the heavens as a curtain, and ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:008925_0010_103033A0133A12C8"/>them out as a tent to dwell in; that bringeth the princes to nothing: He maketh the judges of the earth as vanity". [Chap. XL.]</p>
            <p>NOW, God's ruling in the kingdom of men, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſeth in general that ſupreme power, that uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troulable dominion, which he exerciſeth over all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from one generation to another: Not only his right and power, but his actual government over them. For his ruling in the kingdom of men, implies his continual agency and providence therein, and his reigning over them as a ſovereign Lord; not merely his power and authority to do ſo. And accordingly, whatever befals ſtates and kingdoms; their riſe, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>largement and proſperity, their fall, their declenſion, and the various calamities that happen to them, are in ſcripture attributed to God's over-ruling providence, as the accompliſhment of his ſovereign pleaſure con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them. And that theſe things are juſtly aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to him, is evident from many conſiderations; particularly from his having enabled his prophets to foretel, many ages before-hand, the changes and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volutions which ſhould take place among the nations of the earth: Which predictions have been punctu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally verified by the event.</p>
            <p>THUS the ancient prophecies reſpecting the Jews, the Egyptians, the Babylonians, the Ninevites, the Trojans, and many other nations, have long ſince had a moſt exact and ſurpriſing accompliſhment; as any one, acquainted with the prophecies, and with what has ſince actually befallen thoſe nations, muſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge <note n="†" place="bottom">Many of theſe predictions, together with their reſpective ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments, are ſet in a clear and ſtrong light in the Rev. and very learned Dr. Newton's Diſſertations on prophecy, Vol. I.</note>. And in this book of Daniel's prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:008925_0011_103033A2A96AA940"/>was foretold, with an aſtoniſhing preciſion, tho' in figurative language, what ſhould come to paſs in the four great ſucceſſive monarchies, or empires of the world; the Aſſyrian or Babylonian, the Medo-Perſian, the Macedonian and the Roman; in, or during, the latter of which, the God of heaven was to ſet up a kingdom of a peculiar kind, which ſhould never have an end, or be left to other people: "And the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the dominion, and the greatneſs of the kingdom under the whole heaven, ſhall [at length] be given to the people of the ſaints of the moſt High, whoſe kingdom is an everlaſting kingdom; and all dominions ſhall ſerve and obey him"<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. VII. ver. 27.</note>. Nor is the preſent ſtate of the Jews, or indeed the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſtate of the chriſtian world at this day, any thing leſs than a demonſtration of the truth of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy: which is, at the ſame time, a kind of viſible demonſtration of the truth and reality of God's rul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the kingdom of men. For, certainly none but he, who hath the fates and fortunes of all nations in his own hand, and the moſt abſolute diſpoſal of them, could poſſibly enable men ſo particularly and exactly to foretel what ſhould befal them in remote ages, as the prophets have actually done. And the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment of ſo many prophecies already, as it is an undeniable proof that the world is governed by di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine providence, ſo it gives us an aſſurance, that thoſe predictions in theſe ſacred books, which ſtill remain unfulfilled, ſhall alſo have their accompliſhment at the appointed time; when "the myſtery of God ſhall be finiſhed, as he hath declared to his ſervants the prophets". But,</p>
            <p n="2">II. GOD's ruling in the kingdom of men, may expreſs more particularly and directly that authority and ſovereign power, which he exerciſeth from age
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:008925_0012_103033A52FEE3BB0"/>to age over the kings and potentates of the earth; and which truly denominate him the King of kings and Lord of lords. <hi>That</hi> being may well be ſaid to rule in the kingdom of men, on whom all earthly kings are entirely dependent; who raiſeth one to a throne, and caſteth down another; who gives to all kings their authority, and limits them in the exerciſe there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of; who gives them whatever qualifications they have for ruling; who alſo gives to their lives and reigns, either a ſhorter or longer term, as he pleaſeth; who makes their reign either a bleſſing to the kingdoms which they govern, or the contrary; and who will finally judge even them in righteouſneſs. With the greateſt truth and propriety may he be ſaid to rule and govern in the kingdom of men, who exerciſeth ſuch a dominion over the monarchs of the world. And to enlarge a little here cannot, I ſuppoſe, be thought improper on the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. GOD ruleth in the kingdom of men, as all earthly kings derive their power and authority ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally from him; or as they reign by his permiſſion and providence, and as his miniſters. This is in effect aſſerted in the words immediately following the text— "and giveth it" [i.e. the kingdom] "to whomſoever he will", in the exerciſe of that ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign dominion which he hath over all. In confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity whereto, the prophet addreſſeth himſelf thus to Belſhazzar, the ſon and ſucceſſor of Nebuchadnezzar. "O thou king, the moſt high God <hi>gave</hi> Nebuch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adnezzar thy father a kingdom, and majeſty, and glory. and honor <note n="†" place="bottom">Chap. V. ver. 18.</note>." And the apoſtle Paul aſſerts in a more general way, and without any exception, that "there is no power but of God"; that "the powers that be are ordained of God"; and that kings, and indeed other inferior rulers, are "God's miniſters", ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:008925_0013_103033A819C10480"/>to govern the world under him, the Lord of all; and to carry on the deſigns of his providence therein. So that human government, being duly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtred, is in effect the government of God. For which reaſon we are admoniſhed to be ſubject "to every ordinance of man for the Lord's ſake, whether it be to the king as ſupreme, or unto governors as unto them that are ſent by him for the puniſhment of evil-doers, and for the praiſe of them that do well <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. II. 13, 14.</note>."</p>
            <p>GOD does not indeed, by any immediate act of his own, place a crown upon the head, and put a ſcep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the hand of him, whom he has ordained to reign, and ſeat him upon a royal throne. He leaves nations (ordinarily, I mean) to the free exerciſe of their liberty and diſcretion, under the general law of reaſon, to chuſe their own forms of government, and to model them as beſt ſuits them reſpectively. Some nations neither have, nor are required to have, any kings at all. Some crowns are, properly ſpeaking, elective, by the fundamental laws of the kingdom. In other kingdoms the crown is hereditary, either with certain limitations and exceptions, or without any, according to the various conſtitutions of different king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; which conſtitutions themſelves are not, however, abſolutely immutable. In all which reſpects it may truly be ſaid, that nations are left to the exerciſe of their natural diſcretion and liberty. But ſtill religion, and even reaſon, teaches us to acknowledge the hand and providence of God in the exaltation of any par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſon to a throne. In elective kingdoms the thoughts and counſels of the electors are, tho' imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly, ſo over-ruled, that the choice falls at laſt upon him, whom God had ordained to reign; and thus, without knowing his purpoſe, they fulfil his
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:008925_0014_103033AAD169C380"/>ſovereign pleaſure. And where the crown is here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditary according to the conſtitution, God in his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence often interrupts and defeats the ſucceſſion, either by the death of the preſumptive heir, or by other means; and ſometimes the crown devolves at laſt to one, ſo remote from it by blood, that he was very unlikely ever to wear it, according to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man rules of judging; or it is perhaps transferred to another race. Theſe things are common, and well known; by which God ſhews his own ſovereignty in the kingdom of men, and makes it manifeſt that he "gives it to whomſoever he will".</p>
            <p n="2">2. GOD ruleth in the kingdom of men, as all earthly kings derive from him whatever qualifications and abilities they have for reigning, as well as their authority. How great? how important, is the differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence between a wiſe and good, and a weak and bad king? The welfare of nations, under God, depends very much upon the talents and character of the kings, whom he exalteth to reign over them. Nor is it leſs evident that he beſtows the various gifts and talents by which kings are diſtinguiſhed from one another, than it is that they reign by his permiſſion, and providential ordination. Wiſdom, magnanimity, and other royal qualities, are the gift of God; of which none are poſſeſſed in any greater degree, than he ſaw fit to beſtow them, in order to accompliſh his own wiſe and holy purpoſes. And from ſome theſe qualities are withheld, with the ſame general deſign. For, according to the holy ſcriptures, important events are brought about in nations, and in the ſtate of the world, as well by the folly and infatuation of ſome kings, as by the wiſdom of others; all in conformity to the will and purpoſes of heaven. And this is one way, in which God manifeſts his own ſovereignty in the kingdom of men.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:008925_0015_103033ADD6F1A070"/>3. GOD ruleth in the kingdom of men, by ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the adminiſtration of kings, and by making them great public bleſſings, or the contrary, according to his own pleaſure. Moſt commonly indeed, wiſe and good kings reign ſucceſsfully, while weak and wicked ones prove rather a curſe than a bleſſing. This is not, however, univerſally the caſe. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious that the ſucceſs or proſperity of an adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, does not ſolely depend upon, nor is always in exact proportion to, the wiſdom, juſtice, fortitude, and other princely virtues of him that ſits upon the throne. The views and endeavours of the beſt kings are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times fruſtrated; while thoſe of far inferior ones are crowned with ſucceſs, both in peace and war. It is God that giveth ſalvation unto kings, and thereby to kingdoms: He it is, that bringeth them down. And both theſe he does, in ſuch ways, and by ſuch means, as plainly evince his ſovereignty in the kingdom of men; and ſhew to kings and kingdoms at once, their abſolute dependence upon him for proſperity. How many great and common calamities are there, which befal nations from time to time, that the wiſeſt and moſt powerful monarchs can neither prevent nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move? And how many public bleſſings are there, which kings have little, or perhaps no hand at all, in procuring? Riches, and honor, and power, and all national bleſſings, muſt be acknowledged to come ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginally from God, ſometimes by the inſtrumentality of kings, and ſometimes without it; and in his "hand it is to make great, and to give ſtrength unto all".</p>
            <p n="4">4. GOD ruleth in the kingdom of men, as he gives to the reign of earthly kings either a ſhorter or longer term, as ſeemeth good in his ſight. Mighty monarchs are ſometimes "depoſed from their kingly thrones" for their ſins, as Nebuchadnezzar was. When his
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:008925_0016_103033B01ED5F390"/>mind was hardened in pride, it was ſaid unto him, "The kingdom is departed from thee"; and inſtantly, his glory was taken away, and he was "driven from men". Belſhazzar his ſon did not profit by his example; and therefore met with a ſtill more fatal overthrow. No ſooner had the hand upon the wall written his doom, and Daniel interpreted it,—"God hath numbered thy kingdom, and finiſhed it", &amp;c. than he was ſlain; "and Darius the Median took the kingdom". How many other proud, arbitrary and tyrannical princes, who have thought themſelves above all controul, have ſuddenly been brought down to the duſt? either expelled their kingdoms, or come to an untimely end, and left their thrones to others? Nor is the ſovereignty of God in the kingdom of men, leſs manifeſted in depriving earthly kings of their power and dominion, than in conferring them at firſt. In the language of the royal pſalmiſt, "Promotion cometh neither from the eaſt, nor from the weſt, not from the ſouth. But God is the judge: he putteth down one, and ſetteth up another <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſalm LXXV. 6, 7.</note>."</p>
            <p>BESIDES: It is appointed unto all men, and no leſs to kings, even great and good kings, than others, once to die; and to give an account of themſelves to God. Their greatneſs exempts them neither from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon mortality, nor from the righteous judgment of God, in whoſe hand their breath is. From ſome the great arbiter of life and death, ſoon taketh away their breath, even in early youth; ſo that they hardly know what it is to wear a crown, before they are commanded to reſign it; and called to appear before the high tribunal of him that "regardeth not the perſons of princes". Other kings are taken away in the midſt of their years; and all their devices, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:008925_0017_103033B2E47000C0"/>and deſigns, whether good or bad, are at once brought to nothing; ſometimes to the joy, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times to the ſorrow of their ſubjects; and not only of their own ſubjects, but of other nations. To other kings God is pleaſed to grant length of days, and a reign of many years; ſo that they are ſatisfied with life, and ſee many happy effects of their reign, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore their days are numbered and finiſhed. Now, God manifeſteth his ſovereignty over the kings and poten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates of the earth, by cutting ſhort, or protracting their life and reign, in this manner: And hereby, in part, it appears, that he indeed ruleth in the kingdom of men.</p>
            <p>It may, not improperly, be added here, that a great deal depends upon the time, and particular cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, wherein kings are taken out of this world. There are, with reſpect to their ſubjects at leaſt, I might ſay with reſpect to themſelves alſo, both fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable and unfavourable conjunctures for them to die in. As the caſe may be circumſtanced, the death of a king, tho' of no very eminent qualities and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, may be of fatal conſequence to a kingdom: As, for example, when the ſucceſſion is left doubtful, different perſons laying claim to it, and each of them ſupported by powerful factions. In this caſe, how often have nations been thrown into confuſion, and involved in all the calamities of a civil war? Or, tho' the ſucceſſion is uncontroverted, yet if the heir be not arrived at an age proper for governing a king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, the death of a king in theſe circumſtances is a great calamity: For "Wo to thee, O Land," ſays Solomon, "when thy king is a child." God ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times chaſtizeth nations by removing their kings at ſuch unfavourable conjunctures as theſe, and others that might eaſily be mentioned. And tho' the death
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:008925_0018_103033B58FEA2090"/>of good kings will always be ſincerely lamented by good and dutiful ſubjects; yet it muſt be owned that, in certain circumſtances, the death even of ſuch kings can hardly be looked upon as a frown of divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, in any other ſenſe than that, in which the common mortality of mankind is ſo. As, for exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if they die when they are far advanced in years; when they are almoſt paſt bearing the weight of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment; when their kingdoms are in flouriſhing circumſtances; when the ſucceſion is undiſputed; or there are no parties or factions powerful enough to create public troubles and commotions; when the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor is of mature age for wielding a ſceptre, and is endowed with ſuch princely virtues, as naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpire the hopes of great happineſs under his reign: When all theſe circumſtances take place, they great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly alleviate that ſorrow which all good ſubjects muſt in ſome degree feel, on the death of a good king. And God's ſovereignty in the kingdoms of men plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appears by the particular time and conjuncture, wherein he removeth kings out of this world: For, that theſe circumſtances, whether favourable or other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, together with the duration of each monarch's life, and the length of his reign, are all fixed, all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by the moſt High, no man who believes a providence, can conſiſtently doubt.</p>
            <p>UPON the whole (for I muſt not enlarge): God does not only ſhew himſelf ſovereign in the kingdom of men, by the perſons whom he exalteth to earthly thrones, by the various qualifications which he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon them, by proſpering or not proſpering their reign, by ſometimes caſting them down from their thrones before their lives are come to a period, and by the particular time and circumſtances wherein they are reſpectively taken out of this world by death:
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:008925_0019_103033B82C7A6DC8"/>He does not hereby only ſhew his ſovereign pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in and over the kingdom of men, but he alſo manifeſts hereby his favor and goodneſs towards na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or his righteous diſpleaſure. He executeth loving-kindneſs, judgment and righteouſneſs in the earth, by the diſpenſations of his providence towards kings and kingdoms. The welfare of nations im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately depends, in a great meaſure, upon the kings whom God placeth over them. It is ſaid of Iſrael, with reference to Saul, that God "gave them a king in his anger" After a while, he brought about a <hi>revolution</hi> in that kingdom, and gave them David in his kindneſs, a man after his own heart, who was a great bleſſing to the nation. And when David died in a good old age, after a proſperous reign, and when he had in a manner ſubdued all their enemies, his ſon Solomon ſucceeded him in the throne, whom the queen of Sheba addreſſed in the equally pious and courtly terms following: <q>Bleſſed be the Lord thy God which delighted in thee to ſet thee upon his throne, to be king for the Lord thy God. Becauſe thy God loved Iſrael, to eſtabliſh them forever, therefore made he thee king over them to do judgment and juſtice.</q>
            </p>
            <p>IT being evident then, from what has been ſaid, that God ruleth in the kingdom of men, giving it to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he will; and alſo, that his favor and righteous diſpleaſure are manifeſted towards different nations; or towards the ſame nations at different times, by the "manner of the kings that reign over them", and by the time and circumſtances of their removal out of this world: Theſe things being evident. I ſay, what ſtill remains, is, that we apply this ſubject to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and to the preſent occaſion, by making ſome reflexions on the reign and death of his late majeſty,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:008925_0020_103033BAC3D30CB8"/>and on the acceſſion of George III. to the imperial throne of Great-Britain.</p>
            <p>AND it will not, as is humbly conceived, be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper here, in the firſt place, to take a curſory view of the providential means, by which the Britiſh crown devolved to the illuſtrious houſe of Hanover, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently to his late, and his preſent majeſty. For ſuch a retroſpect on the events of divine providence, at the ſame time that it will be a farther illuſtration of God's ruling in the kingdom of men, and giving it to whomſoever he will, may alſo ſerve to eſtabliſh us in the principles of true Britiſh liberty, and of loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty to his preſent majeſty, as founded in, and reſult<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from, thoſe principles. Nor will you, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, think I go beyond my proper ſphere, if, upon ſuch an occaſion I inculcate loyalty, and obedience to the eſtabliſhed government; and this upon the very principles on which that government is founded, in oppoſition to thoſe of deſpotiſm and tyranny.</p>
            <p>LET me remind you then, that after the death <note n="†" place="bottom">In the year 1603.</note> of queen Elizabeth, (the glory of whoſe reign, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe truly great, was obſcur'd and tarniſhed by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious perſecution) it pleaſed God, doubtleſs for the ſins of the nation, to raiſe four princes ſucceſſively to the throne, whoſe reigns were all inglorious, and ſome of them infamous to the laſt degree; princes of great pride and vanity, of arbitrary notions and practices, of little wiſdom, policy or diſcretion, and ſtill leſs truth, ſincerity and honor; princes who were always the dupes of our ancient, enterpriſing and dangerous enemies, of jeſuits, popiſh miniſters or po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſh wives; princes whoſe reigns diſgraced the nation abroad, and were ſore viſitations of divine providence upon it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:008925_0021_103033BD2FFF3370"/>THE laſt of theſe four kings whom the moſt High gave us in his anger, James II, <note n="*" place="bottom">He ſucceeded his brother Charles II. in 1684.</note> was an open, profeſſed and bigotted roman-catholic; who ſtuck at no meaſures in order to introduce the religion of Rome, to deſpoil the Britiſh nations of their ancient liberties, and to entail upon them the two-fold curſe of popery and ſlavery; which have indeed a cloſe connexion one with the other. The king daily made prodigious ſtrides towards a deſpotic power; to eſtabliſh which on the ruins of the Britiſh conſtitution, was his manifeſt aim. And he doubtleſs promiſed himſelf ſucceſs in this execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble deſign, by reflecting on that ſeries of events in and after the reign of his father, from which he ought to have drawn other concluſions. That unhappy prince, king Charles I. by favouring the papiſts contrary to law, and many flagrant violations of the conſtitution, had involved the nation in a civil war; a war entered into on one ſide, in defence of public liberty, on the other, in the ſupport of tyranny; and which did not end but with the ruin, both of the conſtitution, and of the infatuated prince who had been the blameable cauſe of it. King James ſeem'd to take it for granted, that the nation would never again, at leaſt not ſo ſoon, have recourſe to arms, or reſiſtance, in defence of its rights and liberties; but rather ſubmit to the moſt cruel tyranny, than attempt to rid itſelf of it by thoſe means which, however neceſſary, had been attended with ſuch diſmal conſequences: Eſpecially as the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of paſſive obedience and non-reſiſtance had, ever ſince the <hi>reſtoration,</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">In 1660.</note> been the eſtabliſhed doctrine, which no one could contradict with impunity. It had, however, been a more juſt, as well as more ſafe inference, that the brave people who had lately made
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:008925_0022_103033BF9B4356F0"/>ſuch efforts in defence of their liberties, would not now tamely ſubmit to arbitrary ſway; but again have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to ſome extraordinary means of ſelf-defence, if driven to extremities, whatever doctrines they might profeſs to believe. But— <hi>Quem Deus vult perdere, priùs dementat</hi>— Thoſe whom God deſigns to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy, he firſt infatuates; ſo that they reſolutely per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt in ſuch meaſures, as muſt needs terminate in their ruin. The king was deaf to all the remonſtrances of reaſon and juſtice, of policy and intereſt; and would ſuffer no check in his mad career to deſtruction. Nor was there, perhaps, ever another king, to whom the words of the prophet to Belſhazzar, were more appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable than to this prince, whom neither the fate of his unhappy father, nor any thing elſe, could keep from deſtroying himſelf— <q>O thou king, the moſt high God gave Nebuchadnezzar thy father a kingdom— But when his heart was lifted up, and his mind hardened in pride, he was depoſed from his kingly throne, and they took his glory from him. And he was driven from the ſons of men, and his heart was made like the beaſts, and his dwelling was with the wild aſſes—And thou his ſon, O Belſhazzar, haſt not humbled thine heart, THOUGH THOU KNEW<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>EST ALL THIS! But haſt lifted up thy ſelf,</q>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Dan. V. 18.</note> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>IN this critical conjuncture, it pleaſed him who ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in the kingdom of men, not only to open the eyes of all the friends to public liberty and the proteſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant religion, to ſee the common danger which threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned them, but alſo to unite their hearts and counſels in an extraordinary manner to guard againſt it. Party-diſtinctions, which had hitherto run very high, were now laid aſide. The illuſtrious prince of Orange, the king's ſon-in-law, who was known to be at once a lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:008925_0023_103033C2CCC973E8"/>of liberty, a true proteſtant and an hero, was ſecretly applied to for his advice and aſſiſtance, which he gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly reſolved to afford, to the utmoſt of his ability. He accordingly, after mature deliberation, and by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cert with the leading and better part of the lords and commons of England, arrived there with a very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable armament<note n="†" place="bottom">Nov 5. 1688.</note>; but relying chiefly on the known good-will and affection of the people in general, whom a ſenſe of their common danger had united. It was not long after his arrival, that king James, conſcious he had juſtly forfeited, and intirely loſt, the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of all his ſubjects, except the romancatholic party; ſeeing himſelf forſaken, and people of all ranks flock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ſtandard of the prince; calling to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance, doubtleſs, the tragedy of the 30th of <hi>Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary</hi> 1648; and not being ambitious, it ſeems, to ſhare with his father the glory of <hi>martyrdom</hi>;<note n="*" place="bottom">This ſort of <hi>martyrdom</hi> was very common in ancient times, according to that of the poet—

            <p>THIS was a new and memorable aera in the Engliſh hiſtory. The <hi>declaration of rights</hi> preſented and read to William and Mary, when they were invited into the throne, aſcertained the rights of the ſubject, and reduced the prerogative, which had been extended be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all bounds in many preceeding reigns, to its an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient limits. It was declared by the two conventions before-mentioned, that the kings of England held the crown by virtue of an "original contract," in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to the notions of an indefeaſeable hereditary right: And this was the baſis on which the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was ſettled. Proviſion was now made by many
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:008925_0025_103033C7A1AC6C20"/>parliamentary acts, for ſecuring the public liberty, and the future peace and proſperity of the nation. To which ends, amongſt other things, the ſucceſſion to the crown was limited to the proteſtant line of the royal family, and all romancatholics, however nearly relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it by blood, declared forever incapable of reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in England. The like was done in North-Britain, at that time a diſtinct kingdom.</p>
            <p>KING William and Queen Mary being dead with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaving iſſue, the princeſs Ann, a proteſtant, and a daughter of the then lately out-lawed king James, aſcended the throne in conformity to the parliamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſettlement of the ſucceſſion. In her reign the union between North and South-Britain, which king William had zealouſly recommended before, was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily accompliſhed. An union, which the author of nature had pointed out between two nations on the ſame iſland; both lovers of liberty, both brave and warlike, both generally proteſtant; mutually ſtanding in need of one another's aſſiſtance againſt their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon enemies; and whoſe ſituation, and martial ſpirit, whenever they were at variance, had render'd them ſore ſcourges to each other. Queen Ann, tho' a Stewart, reigned not without reputation and glory, till one or two of the laſt years of her life, when ſhe had fallen into the hands of bad miniſters and counſellors. Her ſon, the duke of Glouceſter, who was otherwiſe to have ſucceeded her, died the year before ſhe came to the throne. <note n="‡" place="bottom">He died in 1700, being in the 11th year of his age. He was a prince of great hopes, whoſe father was prince George of Denmark, the queen's huſband.</note> So that the elector of Hanover was now the preſumptive heir to the crown. But the queen was ſuſpected, and not with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſome good reaſons, of a deſign to ſet aſide, if
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:008925_0026_103033CB1244E528"/>poſſible, the proteſtant ſucceſſion in that illuſtrious houſe, in favour of her [doubtful] brother, the che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valier de St. George; who, whether he were or were not, the ſon of the then late king James, was yet ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded from the throne by law, as a romancatholic. Some, indeed, deny that the queen had any ſuch in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention; and that, with as much confidence as others aſſert it. But be that as it may, upon her death <note n="§" place="bottom">In 1714.</note>, the elector of Hanover (George I.) was immediately, and without oppoſition, proclaimed king of Great-Britain, in conformity to the parliamentary ſettlement of the ſucceſſion, confirmed by repeated acts in both the preceeding reigns. He was a proteſtant, nearly relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the crown by blood; at leaſt nearer than any other proteſtant prince, or princeſs, then living <note n="†" place="bottom">The mother of K. George I. was a grand-daughter of K. James I A princeſs of a very diſtinguiſhed character.</note>. And he reigned with wiſdom, juſtice and clemency, tho' not without ſome diſturbances, and one open re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion, raiſed in favour of the pretender. He died in the 13th year of his reign, leaving behind him the character of one of the wiſeſt, juſteſt, and moſt magnanimous princes of his age. And on the death of this truly great and good king, the Britiſh crown devolved, by the right of ſucceſſion as limited by parliament, to his late majeſty king George II. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Anno 1727.</note>
            </p>
            <p>BY this brief deduction you ſee, on one hand, the repeated efforts of tyranny, and on the other, the glorious ſtruggles for liberty, of which Britain was the ſcene for many years. You ſee how God ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he will. You ſee how mercifully he delivered the Britiſh nations from one popiſh and arbitrary king
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:008925_0027_103033CD92B62170"/>at the revolution; and how he preſerved it once and again from another; I mean the pretender, whom many perſons were deſirous of introducing, to the prejudice of the proteſtant ſucceſſion. You ſee how God has been the guardian of our liberties, civil and ſacred. You ſee that Britiſh ſubjects have the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of living under a legal and limited monarchy; and, what are ſome of the fundamental principles, on which the preſent government is eſtabliſhed. In fine, you ſee by what right the princes of the houſe of Hanover have aſcended the Britiſh throne; not a chimerical and imaginary, but a ſolid, legal and parliamentary one: The beſt and moſt indiſputable right, that any king can poſſibly reign by, unleſs God himſelf ſhould, by a voice from heaven, proclaim him king, or require us, by a prophet, to pay our alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance to him as ſuch.</p>
            <p>BUT ſome may poſſibly expect, that I ſhould ſay ſomething more particularly concerning his late ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. And indeed, tho' I cannot pretend to give his juſt character, yet it would be hardly decent to paſs over his many royal virtues in ſilence; or to bury ſo good and venerable a king, without recollecting ſome of thoſe things, which ought to make us honour his memory.</p>
            <p>HIS late majeſty was unqueſtionably endow'd with a brillant genius; with a great ſhare of natural pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netration and ſagacity Nor was that genius unculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by learning; ſuch learning eſpecially as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a king. He is ſaid to have been extremely well verſed in hiſtory, particularly that of Europe; and to have had a very thorough underſtanding of the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical intereſts and connexions of all the kingdoms and ſtates therein. Without which it would indeed
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:008925_0028_103033CF6C874EA8"/>have been impoſſible for him to maintain his character as the chief bulwark of its liberties, and of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant religion, as he actually was. As he came into England at about thirty two years of age, and lived there about twelve years before he came to the throne, he had, during that period, an opportunity to acquaint himſelf, not only with the Britiſh conſtitution, but with the peculiar temper and genius of the people. Nor could he fail to reap great advantage from the inſtitutions, the political maxims, and the example of ſo wiſe a king, as his royal father. And he was, like him, what may be properly called, a conſtitutional king: One who well knew both the extent of his own prerogative, and the rights of the people; one who made the laws the rule of his government, and whom even malice can hardly accuſe of either doing, or attempting to do, an arbitrary, illegal thing, during his whole reign. And it ſhould be remember'd here, that the Britiſh conſtitution and laws are ſo wiſe, ſo excellent, that he who uniformly makes them the rule of his adminiſtration, muſt of conſequence be a good king; at leaſt he cannot eaſily be ſuppoſed to be a bad one.</p>
            <p>AND merely not to have been a bad king, is per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps grater praiſe than is due to far the moſt of thoſe, who have reigned from the days of Nimrod to the preſent time. But to ſtop here, would be very in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to the character and memory of his late majeſty. He appeared, throughout his reign, to have the true intereſt and honour of Great-Britain at heart; know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that kings, eſpecially Britiſh kings, are made for the people, and not people for kings. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome [to us] unhappy, but yet neceſſary and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>avoidable <hi>connexions,</hi> we have reaſon to think that his majeſty's uniform and great aim was, to promote
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:008925_0029_103033D2120A31D0"/>the good of his kingdoms. He was indeed indefa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigable in his endeavours to this end; and, in the language of the apoſtle, "attended continually on this very thing". He was an encourager of learning, of manufactures and commerce; the two latter of which, I ſuppoſe, never flouriſhed ſo much in Great-Britan, as under his auſpicious reign.</p>
            <p>HIS majeſty was at once a prince of great juſtice and great clemency. The former was evident from his care to have the laws duly executed, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect of perſons; and his not allowing the meaneſt of his ſubjects to be oppreſſed, ſo far as it was in the power of a Britiſh king to prevent it. Nor were private property, the life and rights of the ſubject, ever more ſecure perhaps, than under his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. His majeſty's clemency appeared in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; but in none more conſpicuouſly, than in his conduct towards thoſe who were engaged in the black rebellion of 1745. Very few examples were made of royal juſtice, after that horrid rebellion was at a period. But how many traitors, even obliged, and therefore ungrateful ones, were made examples of the royal grace! His majeſty had a greatneſs of mind, which made him chuſe rather to reclaim his rebelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſubjects by his lenity, than to rid himſelf of them by a juſtifiable ſeverity. And there is reaſon to think, that this truly god-like method of proceeding had a great and happy effect; and was the means, not only of reconciling, but ſtrongly attaching to his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and government, many people who had been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonably diſaffected thereto before.</p>
            <p>HIS majeſty, like his royal father, was a prince of an heroic and martial ſpirit: A lover, indeed, of peace; but one who would not ſuffer himſelf or his ſubjects
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:008925_0030_103033D48C73B6B0"/>to be injured without taking up the ſword, when that meaſure became neceſſary. He was a king, not only of great ſpirit and reſolution, and the moſt undaunted fortitude; but one who well knew how to command armies in the field, when there was occaſion for it: Of which he gave ſome not inglorious proofs.</p>
            <p>HIS majeſty was a prince, even by the confeſſion of his enemies, many of them at leaſt, of great ſincerity and truth, of ſtrict probity and honor, in all his public tranſactions, both towards his own ſubjects and towards foreign ſtates and kingdom. He was far above that deceit, artifice, and low-cunning, for which moſt of the Stewart race were ſo eminent, the <hi>royal martyr</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf not excepted. In ſhort, his whole reign was a confutation of that infamous Machiavellian maxim, "Qui neſcit diſſimulare, neſcit regnare"—He that knows not how to diſſemble, is ignorant of the art of reigning.</p>
            <p>IT was intimated above, that his majeſty was a true proteſtant. As ſuch he was a friend to toleration, and religious liberty; which cannot indeed be violated without violating the natural rights of mankind. His majeſty did not affect, as <hi>defender of the faith,</hi> to make his own private judgment and conſcience a rule to his ſubjects, or to tyrannize over their conſciences. Nor did he, as <hi>head of the church</hi> by law eſtabliſhed in En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland, endeavour to deſtroy the church equally eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed by law in Scotland; or deſire to diſtreſs any of his good proteſtant ſubjects, who might, in ſome reſpects, diſſent from them both. Some inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and hardſhips, I mean legal ones, theſe latter might indeed be ſubjected to; which there is ground to think, a prince of ſo great equity and goodneſs, was ſo far from being pleaſed with, that he would have been
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:008925_0031_103033D7258F8250"/>glad to ſee them wholly removed. Happy had it been for the Britiſh nations, if all his predeceſſors in the throne had been of ſuch generous and catholic prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples—The true church of Chriſt needs not to have her faith <hi>defended</hi> by any other weapons, than thoſe of ſober reaſon and argument, unleſs it be againſt thoſe who attack it with carnal ones. Indeed wicked men and hypocrites can hardly ever think <hi>their</hi> church ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, unleſs ſome other ſword beſides that of the ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, is drawn in her defence. Tho' ſhe have kings for her nurſing-fathers, and queens for her nurſing-mothers; tho' ſhe be rocked in a princely cradle, and ſweetly charm'd to her <hi>repoſe</hi> with royal lullabies; yet ſo perverſe are ſome of her children, that they can take no reſt, unleſs others, out of her pale, are put upon the rack, or otherwiſe harraſſed with penal laws—But, bleſſed be God, all our royal defenders of the faith, ſince James II, have been content to be nurſing-fathers to the church, by preſerving the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic peace, toleration, and liberty of conſcience: The happy effects whereof have been very apparent in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny reſpects. And conſidering the known juſtice and moderation of the royal houſe of Hanover, and alſo of other eminent and diſtinguiſhed perſonages in church and ſtate, we need not wholly deſpair of ſeeing the time, when all good proteſtants, and loyal ſubjects, ſhall have their ſhare in the honors and emoluments of the ſtate, without being ſubjected to any narrow-ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, and injurious <hi>teſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>BUT not to digreſs. It may be ſaid upon the whole, that the maxims of his late majeſty's government were wiſe, noble and truly heroic. And as his views were in general pure, generous and ſublime; ſo it pleaſed God to give him a proſperous reign. During his reign, there have indeed been ſome domeſtic troubles, as
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:008925_0032_103033D996645878"/>well as foreign wars; to prevent which, is not always in the power of the wiſeſt and beſt kings. Nor can it be denied without blindneſs, or extreme prejudice, that ſome great and threatning evils, have been grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the nation ever ſince the revolution. Of which, however, thoſe only ought to bear the blame, who were the criminal cauſes of them. And even not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding theſe evils, it may be truly ſaid, that all theſe reigns have been happy, attended with national proſperity and glory; particularly that of his late majeſty. He ever exerted himſelf wiſely and vigo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rouſly, and, by the bleſſing of God, ſucceſsfully, to promote the public good. The rebellion had a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable ſtop put to it; and the prudent meaſures ſince uſed, have in ſome meaſure allayed old animoſities, and united parties. There has not, perhaps, been greater harmony in the nation ſince the days of queen Elizabeth, if then, than during ſome of the laſt years of his majeſty's reign. During which time, his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's counſels and arms have alſo been remarkably proſpered, not only for the defence of his own domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, but alſo for reducing the pride and power of France. Neither of the four quarters of the world is deſtitute of glorious proofs hereof. Nor is it eaſy to mention any period, wherein the national honor and proſperity were greater, than at the time of his majeſty's deceaſe: Even tho' he left his ſubjects en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in a war, which we could have wiſhed him to terminate with a glory and ſucceſs, equal to that with which it had been carried on for ſome years before. This would have compleated both his and our worldly felicity; and might have rendered the reign of king George II. the moſt glorious period in the Britiſh annals: Yea, it may, perhaps, ſtill be ſo, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding this circumſtance is wanting to compleat the felicity of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:008925_0033_103033DB68C83F20"/>GOD, indeed, bleſſed his majeſty with a long life and reign, tho' not ſo long as his good ſubjects deſired. He was, I ſuppoſe, the oldeſt reigning prince in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, at the time of his deceaſe: And, for many ages paſt, no king of England had attained to his years <note n="†" place="bottom">He was almoſt 77.</note>. Had God regarded the fond wiſhes of his loyal ſubjects, he might indeed have been immortal: For the time would probably never have come, when they would have parted with him without any reluctance. But the moſt High, who ruleth in the kingdom of men, hath ſeen meet to call him out of this world. And altho' we cannot reſign ſo good a king, our common father, without a degree of ſorrow; yet we have doubtleſs far more reaſon to bleſs God for ſparing him to us ſo long, than we have to murmur or complain at his taking him away from us at laſt. And while we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs ſuch an ingenuous grief as becomes dutiful and obliged ſubjects on this occaſion, there are, as was intimated before, many circumſtances to conſole us under the loſs, and make us acquieſce in this diſpenſation of divine providence.</p>
            <p>IT may truly be ſaid of his late majeſty, as it was of king David, that he "died in a good old age, full of days, riches and honor"<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Chron. XXIX. 28.</note>. He died as it were in the arms of victory; triumphing over his enemies, foreign and domeſtic; over the former by his arms, and over the latter by his goodneſs and clemency. He left the nation in as proſperous circumſtances, as could well be imagined in a time of war. He had not only lived longer, but done more good, and therefore acquired more glory, than moſt kings, even good ones, had done before him. Nor, which is a moſt material circumſtance, did he die till he ſaw his royal grandſon and heir, trained up under his own
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:008925_0034_103033DE7347A7B0"/>eye, and that of a princeſs of very diſtinguiſh'd merit, arrived at ſuch a maturity of life and judgment, as qualified him for taking the government immediately into his own hands.</p>
            <p>HOW much better has God been to us in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, than our fears ſometime ſince? not to ſay, than our deſerts, which it were unneceſſary to add. It is now almoſt ten years ſince God, in his holy providence, put us into tears and mourning, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakened our ſerious apprehenſions, by the untimely death of his royal highneſs Frederic, prince of Wales, the then heir apparent, and father to his preſent ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty. The late king was even then old and gray-headed, and was alſo ſaid at that time to be infirm. The next heir to the throne, he who, by the grace of God, now ſits upon it, was but about twelve years of age. So that we had great reaſon to fear, one of the woes would befal us, which Solomon ſpeaks of; that of having a child, or ſcarce more than a child, to reign over us. His late majeſty, in his great wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodneſs, took all poſſible care and pains to guard againſt the inconveniences and hazards of this, if it ſhould pleaſe God to take him away during the minority, and tender age, of his royal grandſon. But, to our great joy, it has pleaſed the moſt High to lengthen out his important life, till he beheld the heir of his kingdoms and dominions of full age, and indeed more than full age, to govern them: And it is ſome time ſince our juſt apprehenſions above mentioned, were laid aſide. Thus graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly hath he, who ruleth in the kingdom of men, provided for our welfare. And as his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent majeſty is the <hi>firſt</hi> king of Great-Britain, born therein, i. e. the firſt born in the iſland of Britain, ſince the kingdoms of England and Scotland were united, God grant he may prove a great and equal
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:008925_0035_103033E180457928"/>bleſſing to both: And that the ſubjects of both, being now united in one kingdom as well as under one king, may have no ſuſpicions, no jealouſies, no contentions among themſelves, unleſs it is a conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who ſhall ſhew at once the greateſt loyalty to his majeſty, and the ſincereſt love to Britiſh liberty, as founded in, as eſtabliſhed and ſecured by, the Britiſh laws: Which ought indeed to be more ſacred with Britons, than the intereſt of any particular perſon or family whatſoever. In ſaying which, I truſt, I ſay nothing unbecoming a good ſubject, in contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtinction to a ſlave.</p>
            <p>ACCORDING to the lateſt advices from Britain, which came to town the laſt evening, it ſeems that a very ſpeedy peace is not now much expected, at leaſt, that it is not to be depended upon. We have indeed his majeſty's declaration to the court on the day of the late king's death, wherein, I think, this is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied: A declaration conceived in ſuch terms, as tend to raiſe our expectations of great felicity under his reign. You will doubtleſs hear with pleaſure part of a ſentence or two, extracted from it, as it has not been made public amongſt us—After ſpeaking of the great loſs which he and the nation had ſuſtained in the ſudden death of the king, his majeſty proceeds thus: <q>But animated by the tendereſt affections for this MY NATIVE COUNTRY, and depending on the advice, the experience and abilities of your lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, on the ſupport and aſſiſtance of every honeſt man, I enter with chearfulneſs into this arduous ſituation; and ſhall make it the buſineſs of my life to promote in every thing the glory and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of theſe kingdoms</q>— A declaration truly worthy a young Britiſh monarch; which we ought to conſider, not as words of courſe, but as proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:008925_0036_103033E44D4936F0"/>from the royal heart of him that made it. <note n="*" place="bottom">Since this diſcourſe was delivered, we have had his majeſty's gracious, and moſt excellent ſpeech from the throne, to both houſes of parliament: In one paragraph of which, he is pleaſed to expreſs himſelf thus— <q>Born and educated in this country, I glory in the name of BRITON; and the peculiar happineſs of my life will ever conſiſt in promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the welfare of a people, whoſe loyalty, and warm af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection to Me, I conſider as the greateſt and moſt perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent ſecurity of My throne: And I doubt not but their ſteadineſs in thoſe principles, will equal the firmneſs of my invariable reſolution to adhere to, and ſtrengthen, this excellent conſtitution</q>—</note> May that God, who hath the hearts of all kings, as well as of their ſubjects, in his hand, confirm his majeſty in theſe noble ſentiments, theſe truly royal purpoſes; and attach the hearts of all good men to his perſon, government and family. May he cloath his enemies with ſhame, while the crown flouriſhes on his head; and while three kingdoms with their dependencies, happy under his auſpicious reign, ſhall with one voice ſay, <q>Long live king George III; and die at leaſt as old, as proſperous, as venerable, as much be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, as much honoured, as George II!</q>—All this we ſincerely hope for; and more than this we could not, perhaps, very modeſtly deſire —</p>
            <p>THOUGH we ought always to remember our late ſovereign with the greateſt veneration, our allegiance muſt now be, or rather is already, transferred to his royal grandſon and heir; in whom, in ſome ſenſe, he ſtill ſurvives &amp; reigns. Theſe Northern American colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies have indeed ever diſtinguiſhed themſelves by their loyalty, and their zeal for the proteſtant ſucceſſion in the houſe of Hanover. We had accordingly a great ſhare in the affections of his late majeſty; the happy fruits of whoſe royal care, and indefatigable endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours for our ſecurity and welfare, we now reap in

His royal highneſs, the late prince Frederic, had alſo a great concern for the proſperity of the colonies, as he well knew both their loyalty, and their importance to Great-Britain. And had he lived to aſcend the throne, we ſhould doubtleſs have had in him ſuch another friend and protector, as we have loſt in his late majeſty. We have no reaſon to doubt, but that his preſent majeſty will have the ſame gracious regard for us; and, perhaps, perfect that deliverance ſo happily begun, and carried on ſo far, for his American ſubjects, within theſe few years paſt. May God give us favour in his eyes, as he did in the eyes, both of his royal grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>father and father, that our great loſs in them may be made up in him! This we have reaſon humbly to hope, if we perſevere in our accuſtomed loyalty; and ſtill conduct ourſelves as dutiful ſubjects. And if our late, ever-honoured king, could now ſpeak to us, I am perſwaded he would admoniſh us to ſhew our regard to his memory, not ſo much by fruitleſly lament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his death, as by a dutiful and loyal behaviour to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards his ſucceſſor; as the certain way to ſecure his royal favour, and, by the bleſſing of heaven, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long, or even to increaſe, our tranquility and happineſs. I almoſt imagine I hear him ſpeaking to Us, in common with all our fellow-ſubjects, in ſuch terms as theſe— <q>Alas! my children, why do you thus in vain la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment my departure from you? Was not man born to die? I was long happy in your affection, and dutiful regard to me. You were alſo long happy under my government, tho' leſs ſo than I ſincerely deſired to make you. The relation of king and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject no longer ſubſiſts between us. But death, which has diſſolved that relation, has not been able to diminiſh my love to you, and concern for your
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:008925_0038_103033E89D79B338"/>happineſs. I cannot indeed now promote it my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf: But, behold THAT ROYAL YOUTH, whom you lately hail'd to the Britiſh throne! —Let all faction ceaſe; be loyal; be public-ſpirited. And in him, as you have another George, expect alſo another friend to your liberties; another guardian of your laws; another father; another victor over your ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, with extended empire, and increaſing glory!</q>—</p>
            <p>BUT let me now cloſe this diſcourſe with ſome very ſhort reflections of a practical nature—How tranſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent is all worldly greatneſs and glory! Whoſe death is it, my brethren, that we have been meditating upon? Is it not that of a king? a great and proſperous king? one, whoſe fortune, whoſe riches and honor, might at once excite the envy of moſt other monarchs, and leave them in deſpair of ever attaining thereto. But, alas! what is worldly felicity, wordly glory? a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den gleam; a meteor darting along the ſky, which is no ſooner beheld, than it falls, and diſappears forever— "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity."—</p>
            <p>IF kings, if great and good kings, ſuch as the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign of the world has dignified with the title of <hi>godsy</hi> muſt ſo ſoon "die like men," certainly we common mortals ſhould not either flatter ourſelves with the hope of immortality here, or place our ſupreme felicity in this world. Can any of us hope ever to arrive at ſuch worldly proſperity and greatneſs, as our late ſovereign enjoyed? Not, certainly, if we are in our right ſenſes. But would even that ſatisfy us? Not, unleſs we were more than mad.— Alas! it is only a low ambition, a ſordid ſpirit, that could take up contented with ſuch a portion, ſuch an happineſs, without looking beyond the grave: For "man being in honor, abideth not"—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:008925_0039_103033EB2A5952E8"/>WE are, moreover, admoniſhed by this diſpenſation of providence, to place our chief hope and confidence, not in man, not even in mighty kings, and potentates, but in the moſt high God, who ruleth in the kingdom of men, and hath the breath of all kings in his own hand — "Put not your truſt in princes, ſays the royal pſalmiſt, nor in the ſon of man in whom there is no help. His breath goeth forth; he returneth to his earth: in that very day his thoughts periſh. Happy [then] is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whoſe hope is in the Lord his God, which made heaven and earth, the ſea, and all that therein is; which keepeth mercy forever."—The Lord ſhall live and reign for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: And the obedient ſubjects of his kingdom ſhall be ever ſecure, ever happy, in his favour and protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, tho' the kingdoms of this world are moved and overturned, or both earth heaven were diſſolved!</p>
            <p>TO conclude then: Let us all be admoniſhed to put our truſt in the great, the eternal God; and, in the way of well-doing, to commit the keeping of our bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and ſouls to him, as unto a faithful creator. Let us both fear God, and honor the king; which duties the apoſtle joins together. Let us endeavour to lead quiet and peaceable lives in all godlineſs and honeſty; "as free, and not uſing our liberty for a cloke of maliciouſneſs, but as the ſervants of God;" and, by patient continuance in well-doing, ſeek for glory, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor and immortality. Let us be faithful and diligent in diſcharging the duties of our ſeveral ſtations in life; knowing that we are ſoon to paſs off the ſtage of this world, and to give an account of ourſelves to God the judge of all. And let me remind you, that in the judgment of the great day, it will be of far leſs impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, who has been a king, or mighty monarch, and who a perſon of low degree, than it will be, who has
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:008925_0040_103033EDB13EBC38"/>been a truly upright and good, and who a diſhoneſt and wicked man. For when the ſea, death and hell [hades] ſhall deliver up the dead that were in them, and the ſmall and great ſhall ſtand together before God, they ſhall be <q>judged every man according to their works.</q>
            </p>
            <p>WHEREFORE now unto him, the king eternal, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal, inviſible, who hath prepared his throne in the heavens, and whoſe kingdom ruleth over all; unto him be glory for ever and ever, AMEN.</p>
