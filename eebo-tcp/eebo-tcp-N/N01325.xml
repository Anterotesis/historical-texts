            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>GOD at firſt created Man Upright, after his own Image, able to keep the Law of God perfectly, and to be ſufficiently happy in ſo doing. But Man by ſinning, loſt his ability to keep the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of God, loſt Communion with God, and incurred his Wrath and Curſe, and juſtly deſerved everlaſting Damnation: God might juſtly have left all Mankind to periſh in this ſtate, without any opportunity ever to be delivered; but it pleaſed God of his infinite Mercy, not to ſuffer all Mankind to lie under their deſerved Puniſhment; but (the firſt way of Salvation by Works being loſt, we being guilty of ſin paſt, and can make no a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mends,
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:001573_0004_0FB3DB50D68EEAE8"/>
nor perfectly obey for the future) God ſent his Son to do for us, in our room and ſtead, what we cannot do for our ſelves, that now the way of Salvation is by <hi>Faith,</hi> to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply what he has done for us. Now as God might juſtly have left all the world without any opportunity ever to be ſaved, ſo it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed him to leave the moſt part of the world without the ordinary means, <hi>viz.</hi> the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the way of Salvation, till the coming of Chriſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 147.19, 20. And as a token that he is the only Saviour among all Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and he that brings Salvation into the world, ſo after his coming (and that directly ſo ſoon as his coming offering up himſelf was finiſhed) not only <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but all Nations are called to believe in him, <hi>Acts</hi> 17.30. But the firſt way of Salvation which Man was created to, and created with a knowledge ſufficient for the performance of the Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of it, being loſt, and there being a <hi>New Way</hi> of Salvation come in the room of it, which is not natural, ſo the knowledge of it is not natural, but muſt be acquired, &amp; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore is revealed in the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21. which God at firſt revealed by his Prophets, and afterwards by his Son, <hi>Heb.</hi> 1 1, 2. and is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001573_0004_0FB3DB50D68EEAE8"/>
to writing in the holy Scriptures. But to help our ignorance of Gods Law, ſince the Fall, and our total Ignorance of the <hi>New Way of Salvation,</hi> God has appointed <hi>Men</hi> to be Officers in his Church, to inſtruct us in the way of Salvation, <hi>Epheſ.</hi> 4.11. which is, by Gods appointment, become a neceſſary means, as by his help, may further appear.</p>
            <p>In this Chapter we have the account of our Saviours Reſurrection, Appearing to his Diſciples, and giving them Commiſſion to preach the Goſpel, <hi>v.</hi> 15. to every Creature, <hi>per ſynecdochen generis,</hi> for every <hi>human Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, i.e.</hi> to all the Children of Men, ſo far as they could, thro'-out the world; the effect whereof ſhall be according as they <hi>receive</hi> or <hi>reject</hi> it, <hi>i. e.</hi> Salvation or Damnation: No middle way.</p>
            <p>I ſhall not at this time undertake to note every point of Doctrine and Principle of Faith that may be learned from the words, nor how far <hi>Baptiſm</hi> is neceſſary to Salvation, but thus far this Scripture, as it does not damn a perſon meerly for the want of Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, ſo neither does it promiſe Salvation without. It ſeems the perſon that hath op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, and does not uſe it, cannot be aſſured.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:001573_0005_0FB3DB52571E55C0"/>But by openly ſpeaking from this Scripture, I ſhall occaſion ſome to read the following words with the more obſervation, &amp; therefore hold it to be my duty to endeavour to prevent their miſtake in the meaning of them, I ſay, thus much, That as God does uſe us as rati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Creatures, ſo what he requiers us to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve (whether it be matter above our Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or not) he upon the firſt requiring it's Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, gives a rational Proof by Miracles, which being confirmed, the Miracles ceaſe. Neither ſhall I inſiſt upon ſhewing what that Faith is, that has the Promiſe of Salvation. It is not a bare aſſenting to the Truth; for that the Devils do, and more, <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19. but it is a Faith, that being according to the Truth, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perates upon the Will, and works a change in the Perſon in whom it is, in his <hi>Love, Hope</hi> and <hi>Practice.</hi> His <hi>Love</hi> is changed, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14 17 <hi>Mat.</hi> 6.21. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his <hi>Hope</hi> is not in any imaginary Innocence of his own, or good Works, or any thing but <hi>Gods free Grace, free good Will and Pleaſure</hi> in giving us Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the alone Merits of Chriſt, <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.5. He labours after all Holineſs of Life, not as a <hi>Cauſe</hi> of his Salvation, but as the <hi>beginning</hi> of his Happineſs, as his <hi>Duty</hi> to God, as a <hi>proof</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:001573_0005_0FB3DB52571E55C0"/>

            <p>Neither does the Text lead us to enquire who is the <hi>efficient Cauſe</hi> of ſaving Faith, but it ſhews us the <hi>Inſtrumental Cauſe,</hi> which has the promiſe of a bleſſing to him that diligent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attends it, and which Chriſt has purchaſed, not only for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> but for us <hi>Gentiles,</hi> of which this preſent Occaſion is an Effect, and therefore calls for our great Thankfulneſs</p>
            <p>From what lies before us, <hi>viz.</hi> the Effect of the Preaching of the Goſpel, or rather the neceſſary Conſequence of its being <hi>received</hi> or <hi>rejected</hi> (with Baptiſm, implying the other Ordinances) as we have it in our Text, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt other profitable things, we may learn this</p>

               <head>DOCTRINE,</head>
               <p>That the Ordinances of the Goſpel, and eſpecially the Preaching of it, is that where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Mens Salvation and Damnation is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. A weighty! a frightful Conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! which we ſhould concern our ſelves a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout with joy and trembling, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 2.11.</p>
               <p>This Truth is viſible, needs no proof, but Improvement and ſuitable Meditations,

               <p>But, <hi>firſt,</hi> If it be enquired, <hi>Wherein are the Ordinances of the Goſpel, things that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern the Salvation and Damnation of Men?</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw. Firſt,</hi> The Preaching of the Goſpel reveals to us his Mind &amp; Laws, who rewards with Salvation &amp; puniſhes with Damnation. All Law-givers make Laws to reward or puniſh, according to the Deed or Offence, &amp; according to the Authority of the Law-giver. A King (if he ſee cauſe, and the crime deſerve it) puniſhes with Death, and his Wrath is as Fearful, <hi>Prov.</hi> 16.14. The King of Kings has it in his power to puniſh with Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and he only, <hi>Luke</hi> 12.4, 5. and ſo much the more Terrible is his <hi>Fear, Pſal.</hi> 76.7, 12.

againſt the King may deſerve <hi>Death,</hi> which againſt a mean Man would be a ſmall offence. Conſider the Majeſty of him whoſe Law is broke, and he deſpiſed who made the Law, <hi>Luke</hi> 10.16.

Zech. 11.13. <hi>A goodly price that I was valu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at by them.</hi> Conſider his pure and infinite Holineſs, Hab. 1.13. <hi>Of purer Eyes than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold evil.</hi> Conſider his dreadful Threatning to every breach of his Law, Gal. 3.10. <hi>Curſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed is every one that continueth not in all things written in the Book of the Law, to do them,</hi> which Curſe is to hell, <hi>Mar.</hi> 25.41. and no wonder when the Authority of God is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiſed; If there be one thing that a Perſon does not continue to do, if at one time in one thing he tranſgreſs the Law, he is under the Curſe, and this Curſe all lie under that are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſed by Chriſt applyed by Faith. About theſe things the Goſpel reveals Gods mind to us, and therefore concerns our Salvation or Damnation.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, The whole concernment of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel and it's Ordinances, is about Mens Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Damnation, which is therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned in it.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:001573_0007_0FB3DB55562196A0"/>3dly, It is (eſpecially the Preaching of the Goſpel) neceſſary in order to eſcape from the Wrath of God, due to us for Sin, (we are all till delivered) under Gods Wrath and Curſe which neceſſarily brings Damnation, <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.3 <hi>And were by nature the Children of Wrath, even as others.</hi> Rom. 3.19. <hi>That every mouth may be ſtopped, and all the World become guilty before God.</hi> It is Chriſt that Redeemed us from the Curſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.13.

               <p>This plainly ſhews the neceſſity of a Prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cher, in order to Salvation. But to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand this, conſider,</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>First,</hi> Man has neceſſity of a Revelation of more then he can know without (ſince the fall) in order to Salvation, as has been ſhewed, ſee alſo <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 4.6.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, God does not want Men as Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, nor the help of any outward means
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001573_0007_0FB3DB55562196A0"/>
to make known to us the way of Salvation; He can, if he pleaſe, reveal himſelf and his Son (whom it is eternal Life to know, <hi>John</hi> 17.3.) without the uſe of any means, to one that never heard of his Name; but if he has not promiſed it (as he has not) then it is Preſumption, and not Faith) to believe he will, eſpecially ſeeing he ſays, it is his <hi>Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> (Mark, not his <hi>Neceſſity</hi> but his <hi>Pleaſure</hi>) by as <hi>fooliſh</hi> a thing as Men count Preaching (and as fooliſh a thing, as uncapable a thing as it is in it ſelf) to ſave them that believe, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.21 And he that will venture his Soul, and the Souls of his Children upon a meer perſumption, believing what God has rather ſaid he will not do, than that he will do it, muſt fare according to his works, and have his reward where he got his Faith.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, It is not the virtue or powerfulneſs of the Man, nor his Arguments, that makes the Word Preached effectual to converſion or edification, but it is meerly the bleſſing of God, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.6. So it is God and his Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er that gives the effect, and the outward means is to be uſed only becauſe of his Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and Inſtitution, becauſe it is his pleaſure; As <hi>Moſes</hi> lift up his Rod to work
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:001573_0008_0FB3DB56D674B7E0"/>
the Wonders in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and divided the Sea. Had not <hi>Moſes</hi> obeyed and uſed the ſign, it had not been done; yet what virtue had <hi>Moſes's</hi> Rod to do it? So it is the Inſtitution of God, not the Virtue, Wiſdom or Grace of the Man [the Preacher] that cauſes the Bleſſing. And therefore our Saviour bid the People hear the Phraiſees, and do their words becauſe of their Office, ſitting in <hi>Moſes</hi> Seat, and teaching Truth. And this, by the way, may ſerve to ſolve the Queſtion, <hi>Whether it be duty to hear a Wicked Man, while he holds the Office of a Minister, and teaches Truth?</hi> The Prieſt, in our Saviours time was a Wicked Man, and yet our Saviour owned him in his Office, and ſent the Man healed of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proſie to him. The Sons of <hi>Ely</hi> were ſcan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dalouſly Wicked, and yet God owned them in the holieſt part of their Office, <hi>i. e.</hi> to carry the Ark, which if another Man touched, he preſently dyed; though God puniſhed their wickedneſs, as he had threatned before, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 2.34. It is another Queſtion, <hi>Whether a Wicked Man, that is found to be ſo, ſhould be continued in the Ministry?</hi> For certainly he ought to be turned out by thoſe that have power to do it. But while he ſtands in his
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001573_0008_0FB3DB56D674B7E0"/>
place, he ought to be heard, provided he teach the Truth; For falſe Doctrine is the Souls Poyſon, and ought not to be heard (at leaſt not in a way of Worſhip) St. <hi>Paul</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyces when the Goſpel is taught, though by Wicked Men out of Envy; but prays for a curſe upon him that teacheth falſe Doctrine, though it be himſelf, or an Angel from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.8. <hi>Phi.</hi> 1.15.18.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly, No Man has power of himſelf (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as a wiſe man, a learned man, and a good man) to ſpeak any thing to Edificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but as God who knows the hearts and ſtate of all Men, does by his holy Spirit guide, direct and aſſiſt him, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.5. Which we are to ſeek, pray and wait for in the way of diligent ſtudy, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But in this, ſo well as the former, it is to be allowed, that ſtudy has a proper Tenden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and publick Preaching &amp; private Reading and Diſcourſe, have a proper Tendency to perſwade to duty, and convince of Sin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But, <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is Gods Inſtitution that makes it Warrantable to uſe them and in that they are like <hi>Moſes</hi> Rod.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly, The perverſneſs of mans Nature is, ſuch, that this Tendency will not be effectual,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001573_0009_0FB3DB5856191EA8"/>
except Gods Grace incline the heart, and give the bleſſing, as to <hi>Moſes</hi> Rod.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, When men are perſwaded, it is yet a further work of Gods Mercy. Grace that works a Change in the heart unto Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion and Edification, which he ever gives to an obedient ſeeking in his way, as he gave the wonders to be wrought upon <hi>Moſes,</hi> his obedience in lifting up his Rod, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Thus far at preſent concerning the neceſſity of the Goſpel preached in order to Salvation.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly, The Goſpel preached, and its Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances adminiſtred, have always influence upon the Souls of the hearers or receivers, bringing them nearer to Salvation or to Damnation, increaſing the one or the other, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.16. <hi>To the one we are a ſavour of Death unto Death, and to the other a ſavour of Life unto Life,</hi> Iſa. 55.10. Our Food always does us either good or harm.</p>
               <p n="5">5thly, There were no occaſion of the Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of the Goſpel, were it not in order to our ſtate in the next world.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>ſecond</hi> place, if it be enquired, <hi>How the Salvation &amp; Damnation of men is concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Ordinances of the Goſpel?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1st, In reſpect of <hi>What</hi> is preached, and the manner of it.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:001573_0009_0FB3DB5856191EA8"/>2dly, In reſpect of what <hi>Improvement</hi> is made of it.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond</hi> is intended in the Text. The <hi>first</hi> has relation to it.</p>
               <p>As to the <hi>first,</hi> in reſpect to <hi>What</hi> is taught. 1ſt. In reſpect to the Truth or Falſhood of it, our Souls are concerned. 2dly. In reſpect to the Nature of it, whether it be of great concernment to be taught, or not? And alſo, Whether it be that wherein the Souls of the hearers are much concerned, or not? For there may be many things true, which will not do the hearers much good or harm; and ſome things will do more good than others, and to ſome perſons more than to others, <hi>I</hi> mean, they have ſuch a tendency, and ſome things are as life to the Soul, when applyed, <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.63, 68. Thus our Souls are concerned, not only in the truth or falſhood of what is taught, but alſo in the Profitable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Uſefulneſs of it. This ſeems to be partly intended, 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.4.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly, In reſpect to the <hi>Manner</hi> of Teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, it has a tendency to be more or leſs pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable, as the Method, Arguments, Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, Fervency, Voice, Geſture, and Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Teacher, and alſo, the evidence
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:001573_0010_0FB3DB59D65D1CE8"/>
of a Sence of the Needfulneſs and weight of the Doctrine, &amp; an affection to do his hearers good: Theſe things ſhould be diligently ſtriven for, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.15. <hi>Study to ſhew thy ſelf approved unto God, a Work-man, that needeth not be aſhamed, rightly dividing the Word of Truth.</hi> But the latter of theſe things (eſpecially) is out of the power of Man, and depends purely upon the aſſiſtance and grace of the holy Spirit (<hi>I</hi> mean, to be affected) and he gives and with-draws as he pleaſeth, and that ſome times in Mercy, and ſomtimes in Judgment; ſometimes for encouragement and edification, and ſometimes for chaſtize<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that to the Hearers, or to the Preacher, or both; therefore both ought to labour, watch, pray, ſtrive, and to the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termoſt improve the Grace given.</p>
               <p>But if any ask, <hi>Why is all this needful, ſee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it is not the power or virtue of the Man, or his Arguments, but the Grace of God that gives the Succeſs?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1ſt, Becauſe it is the pleaſure of God to require Means, as the Condition of his Bleſſing, ſo the ſuitabler the Means are, the more they have of the nature of Means in them, and it comes the nearer to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="15" facs="unknown:001573_0010_0FB3DB59D65D1CE8"/>2dly, God delights to give his Grace to the diligent ſeeker, but has promiſed nothing to the idle perſon. But God does not tye his bleſſing wholly to the ſtrength of Means, but ſometimes encourages humble diligent En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours with a bleſſing upon weak Means, and ſometimes he chaſtens or puniſhes Negli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence or carnal Confidence, by denying a bleſſing upon ſtrong Means.</p>
               <p>There is alſo ſpecial Influence upon the Salvation and Damnation of men, by the Examples of others, eſpecially of the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the Goſpel, and that eſpecially in Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant perſons.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Secondly,</hi> With reſpect to what Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is made of the Ordinances of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel by the hearers, their Salvation or Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is concerned, and herein moſt of all, provided Goſpel Truth be taught; and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this lies the ſtreſs of our Text.</p>
               <p>He that has plain wholſom Food may live by feeding upon it, when he that has the beſt Food in the world, will ſtarve, if he do not uſe it.</p>
               <p>The Miniſters Work is to teach wholſom Doctrine, ſuch as his hearers need, and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply it as Food or Phyſick, according to the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001573_0011_0FB3DB5B597A9158"/>
need, and if he neglect, the Soul of the hearer dyes, and his <hi>Blood is required at the neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers hands,</hi> Ezek. 33.8.</p>
               <p>But if the Miniſter do never ſo well, it yet depends upon the <hi>Improvement</hi> made by the hearer. Many of our Saviours hearers did not profit; and of ſuch we read, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 58.5. <hi>who will not hearken to the Voice of the Charmers charming never ſo wiſely;</hi> and our Text tells us of ſuch, that they ſhall be <hi>Damned.</hi> But ſome think they believe, and are free becauſe they aſſent to the Truth, <hi>and ſo does the Devil;</hi> but 1 Joh. 3.3. <hi>he that hath this Hope purifieth himſelf.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And here I muſt endeavour to cut off an ignorant Deluſion which undoes Thouſands. Becauſe we have all Imperfections and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities in this World, many excuſe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from neceſſary and practicable Duty, under the notion of not being perfect. Say thy, <hi>That was a good Sermon, could I practiſe but the half of it, I ſhould be happy.</hi> Says another, <hi>Our Miniſter preaches excellent well, he that does practiſe one quarter of it well, needs not fear,</hi> or <hi>it is well with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To anſwer theſe, I muſt teach you to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinguiſh. There are ſome things belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001573_0011_0FB3DB5B597A9158"/>
to the Law which we muſt diligently endeavour to do, and ſtrive after, or we cannot be ſaved: There are things that we muſt do in part, and he that does heartily ſtrive to do them, and does really perform in part, and follow after a greater meaſure, is forgiven, and accepted in Chriſt. There are other things belonging to the Goſpel, which we muſt certainly do, or we cannot be ſaved, as <hi>Repentance, Faith, Prayer, Love, &amp;c.</hi> Now if the Preacher rightly divide the Word, laying down what is to be ſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven after, as ſuch, and what muſt ſurely be done, as ſuch, and therein teach the Truth, then, I ſay, you muſt ſurely practiſe all, or you cannot be ſaved; whatever your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſes are, if you do not, you deceive your ſelf, <hi>James</hi> 1.22. <hi>Be ye doers of the Word, and not hearers only, deceiving your own ſelves.</hi> You may build your ſelf a hope, but your building is in the Sand, and our Saviour ſays it will fall, and great will be the fall thereof, becauſe you heard theſe Sayings of his and did them not, ſee <hi>Mat.</hi> 7. and <hi>John</hi> 13.17. <hi>If ye know theſe things, happy are ye if ye do them;</hi> Not otherwiſe, but if ye do them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:001573_0012_0FB3DB5CDCC5CC88"/>Object. <hi>But who can remember all the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons that ever he hears, to practiſe all?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> Tho' you cannot remember all the <hi>Arguments,</hi> yet you may remember all the <hi>Duties,</hi> and ſo much of the Arguments as may ſatisfie you in the Duty or other Truth, and move you to follow it; and alſo, ſo much as to go away with your heart affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, your convictions, hopes, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> increaſed, your Love, Zeal, Faith, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> quickened. Our Duties are not ſo many, nor the Dire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions, how to perform them, ſo many, but an ordinary Capacity may retain them.</p>
               <p>Queſt. <hi>What need we then ſo much to learn?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1ſt, Becauſe we are very apt to forget the Duties we know. 2dly, We are very apt to forget the Need of them, and ſo need quickning. 3dly, It is Gods appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that ought to be reaſon enough for us. A living Man loves his Food, and he that is alive from ſin, loves to feed upon the Truth, and to be put in mind of it, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 122.1. Only knowing, will not do, nor Practice, unrenewed; ſee 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.12. A Preacher's Work is not only to teach New things, but <hi>To put us in mind</hi> of what we
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001573_0012_0FB3DB5CDCC5CC88"/>
know already, altho' we be eſtabliſhed in preſent Truth. 4thly, What we do know, we may learn to know better.</p>
               <p>Obj. <hi>But if it be God only that gives the Increaſe, to what purpoſe ſhall we strive?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> God does not give the Increaſe without us, but within us, and in and upon our ſtriving, <hi>Iſa.</hi> 26.12. <hi>Phil.</hi> 2.12, 13. <hi>Work out your own Salvation with Fear and Trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling. For it is God that worketh in you both to will and to do, of his own good pleaſure.</hi> You know, that God works no increaſe in you by his Word, if you do not practiſe, but diſobey it. If there be need for the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter to preach, there is need for you to hear and practiſe; for that is all the uſe of Preaching. And we ſee in our Text, that the Miniſters are commanded to preach, and in this caſe we are told, <hi>Luke</hi> 8.16. <hi>No man having lighten a Candle puteth it under a Veſſel, &amp;c.</hi> Therefore it is as much a ſin for you to neglect to hear or practiſe, as for the Miniſter to neglect to preach.</p>
               <p>Again, Mens being Saved or Damned does alſo much depend upon the manner of the hearers attendance, 1st, According to what our Expectation is. If we expect E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dification,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001573_0013_0FB3DB5E581D33D8"/>
or not, expect it according as we eſteem the Preacher, and ſo relie upon the Inſtrument, and not upon the meer Grace of God, and his bleſſing upon his Ordinance, it is a ſad ſign: We ought to ſeek the beſt means, but truſt in God alone, and believe he is able as well to bleſs the weakeſt as the ſtrongeſt means, and ſo thankfully attend the Means which he is pleaſed to give, and not be carnally confident when we eſteem the Preacher, nor diſcontent when we eſteem him not, leſt God in his juſt Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment leave us to his Curſe, and to be deluded by the Devil, and made to think what he pleaſe, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17.5, 6, 7, 8. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Curſed is the Man that truſteth in Man; for he ſhall be like the Heath in the Deſart, and ſhall not ſee when good cometh,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Bleſſed is the Man that truſteth in the Lord; for he ſhall be as a Tree planted by the Waters,</hi> &amp;c <hi>neither ſhall ceaſe from yeilding Fruit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2dly, If we attend with fervent Deſire of Edification, it is a good ſign, <hi>Mat.</hi> 5, 6, <hi>Bleſſed are they which do hunger and thirſt after Righteouſneſs, for they ſhall be filled:</hi> When it is thus with us, we receive the Truth, and Directions for our help, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> as

               <p n="3">3dly, If with Patience we attend, wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to wait Gods time by diligent ſtriving, Lam. 3.25. <hi>The Lord is good unto them that wait for him, to the Soul that ſeeketh him,</hi> not a ſitting ſtill to wait, but a watchful patient waiting, as you may ſee <hi>Hab.</hi> 2. <hi>I will ſtand upon my Watch,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>Tho' it tarry, wait for it, becauſe it will ſurely come, it will not tarry,</hi> Pſal. 40.1.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly. If a Self-denying Frame we attend, willing to practiſe and believe, tho' it be a croſs to do it, Iſa. 28.9 <hi>Whom ſhall he teach? Them that are weaned,</hi> &amp;c. When a perſon is not willing to deny himſelf, he is not in a condition to receive the Truth, which always goes croſs to our evil nature; and this very thing cauſes ſome to oppoſe the Truth, and ſome only to oppoſe the Miniſter of it, but keeps all that are ruled by it, from getting good, 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.11. <hi>Becauſe they received not the love of the Truth, God ſhall ſend them ſtrong Deluſions, that they ſhould believe a Lye, that they all might be Damned,</hi> &amp;c.</p>

Then ſurely the choiceſt, the ableſt and wiſeſt of the Children of Men ſhould be the Miniſters of it. We uſe to take the capableſt men for the moſt difficult and dangerous Work.

It is ſurely the greateſt Work that ever Man was imploy'd in; and ſurely no man need account himſelf too great to be imployed in it; for it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the very end of our being, and the One Thing needful; and who is ſufficient for theſe things? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2, 16.</p>

Who that is ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of it, can undertake it, but with Fear and Trembling.

                  <p>Again, the Preaching of the Goſpel, as it is too ſacred a Work to be undertaken for the honour of this world, ſo it is too ſacred to be varniſhed with excellent words of mans Wiſdom, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2. As God has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed proper Means, ſo natural parts, and acquired parts by Learning have their proper tendency to help men in Invention, Reaſon and Utterance; but he that ſtrives to ſhew it when he is acting in that which concerns mens eternal Eſtate, ſeems to have forgot the worth of mens Souls, or the dread of the Danger would drive ſuch ſmall things out of his mind: Surely he that does ſo, is

not ſenſible of the greatneſs of his Work, and is ſo far unfit for it, and ſeems to have forgot that he is to preach Chriſt, and not himſelf, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4, 5, it is a grievous prophain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Gods Ordinance. Parts and Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing are of great uſe, but we muſt not be fed with the Diſh in which our Food is brought to us. Religion is of too excellent a nature in it ſelf, to be made more beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful by Mans Wiſdom. A Tow Lace will not become a Silk Garment; it may be of uſe to ſpin and weave the Silk, but ſpoils it if it be mixed with it. It ſhows an Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of the excellency of Religion, when Men think to beautifie it ſo. And the ears of the hearers being tickled with fine words, has a tendency to divert their Mind from the ſenſe of the weight of the Truth which they hear. Let plain intelligible ſignificant words be uſed in Religion.</p>

               <div type="part">
                  <head>Fifthly,</head>
                  <p>Is Mens Salvation or Damnation concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Preaching of the Goſpel? Then we have need, for our Souls ſake, to avoid all ſuch things as hinder the Succeſs of it; for if it prove unſucceſsful, it may coſt you
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:001573_0018_0FB3DB669A85FE48"/>
your Soul! Therefore let all <hi>Worldly Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, viſits and diſcourſes</hi> be avoided when we go to, but eſpecially when we go from hearing the Word Preached, while it is freſh upon our mind, which is the only time to make a ſenſible application of it. We eat our food viſibly, we digeſt it inviſibly, if both be not done we cannot live; ſo we learn for our edification openly and publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; we really get the good of it privately and ſecretly. Our Food is digeſted by the working of nature, Our ſpiritual Food by the working of our Minds, which muſt take time, and our mind cannot do it while di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted by other things. The Beaſts which did not chew the Cud after they had eaten it, were accounted unclean. And the Perſon that only hears, and makes no further appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, is Unclean in the ſight of God. Our Food begins to digeſt ſo ſoon as it is eaten, or not at all; and experience ſhews that many a Perſon coming from a Sermon much affected or awakened, but not improving it, preſently has by the next day loſt all the ſenſe of it, or at leaſt ſo much that he remains as he was before. Thus Men <hi>quench</hi> and <hi>grieve</hi> the Spirit, 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 5.19. <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.30. and ſo
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:001573_0018_0FB3DB669A85FE48"/>
many looſe their Salvatian, not having the like return upon them again. Thus many do the work of the Devil to their near Friends by entertaining them with ſuch diſcourſes after a Sermon which quite puts out that ſpark of eternal life, that began to kindle in them, and ſo occaſion their Damnation. It was not for nothing that God appointed the weekly day of his publick Worſhip to be kept <hi>Holy</hi> from all ſecular Imployments. Application muſt be made that very Day. If our Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on be inſtrumentally procured by the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Word, and if Damnation comes by the unſucceſsfulneſs of it, then that which makes it unſucceſsful, is in that reſpect the worſt of Evils. Other Sins are Pardoned when the Sinner Repents and is Converted, but <hi>This</hi> hinders Repentance and Converſion. <hi>The end</hi> of Religion is <hi>lost</hi> where the Word is unſucceſsful. No wonder then if the <hi>Wrath of God</hi> fall upon that Land where ſuch things are a cuſtom, as hinder the ſucceſs of it. But that the falling upon unneceſſary worldly Diſcourſe ſoon after Sermon, or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed any time the ſame day, has this woful effect; is dreadfully proved from matter of Fact. But becauſe it is that which works
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:001573_0019_0FB3DB6819581538"/>
inviſibly upon mens Minds, therefore few ſee it, and the blindneſs of mind and hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of heart, that it works in thoſe upon whom it takes effect, hinders their obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it. Though Prophaneneſs of life and want of Grace, where the word is taught, is an open proof, but like a diſtemper or ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, procured by ſome Intemperance. The ſickneſs is ſeen by all, but few (yea, the Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient himſelf does not) know the cauſe. There is great complaint of Prophaneneſs (and cauſe enough) as that which brings Gods Wrath upon the Land; but if the Word taught were <hi>effectual,</hi> that would be healed; Therefore while ſuch Cuſtoms are upheld, as make that Word ineffectual, that procures Gods Anger, as the foundation cauſe. The Streams of Iniquity it is that overflows the Land; but the way to ſtop them, is to begin at the Fountain. The Streams of Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion it is, that muſt heal the Land; but the way to procure them, is to remove that which ſtops them in the Fountain. All the Counſels of Hell could not have found out a more <hi>effectual</hi> way to deſtroy Religion, than the cuſtom that is in ſome places, of viſiting on the Lords Day evening, and in ſome places
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:001573_0019_0FB3DB6819581538"/>
on the Lords Day it ſelf, after Sermon; not but that Religious viſits are lawful upon the Sabbath Day it ſelf; but after hearing <hi>openly,</hi> our work is application <hi>ſecretly.</hi> Indeed if ſome diſcourſe be uſed after a Sermon, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning its uſefulneſs, and the need to apply and practiſe it, it may double its effect upon many hearers; but ſtill, Application is <hi>ſecret.</hi> And what excuſe is this for a diſcourſe which <hi>hinders</hi> ſucceſs? And if we find that we cannot diſcourſe with a Friend without ſo bad an effect, we are obliged not to truſt our ſelves by the rule which bids us <hi>pray that we be not led into Temptation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But why may not People tarry at home as much as on other times in the week? and each man keep his own houſe from being a <hi>Play-Houſe?</hi> and keep his Family at home to minde good, and teach them?

through your neglect, their blood will be required at your hands. He that anſwers for <hi>anothers</hi> life, pays for it with his own. How Terrible is it then to have anothers Damnation to pay for! You work and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour <hi>all day and daily</hi> for their Bodies; and can you not ſpend ſome pains <hi>weekly</hi> for their Souls! which is a work much more difficult, and a Thouſand Million times more needful; and therefore we are required to make it our conſtant care, <hi>Sitting in our houſe, walking by the way,</hi> &amp;c. And not only Catechiſing, and <hi>Knowledge,</hi> but alſo Spiritual <hi>Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> and Application of Knowledge is your work to teach them; For otherwiſe <hi>all Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge</hi> of <hi>all Myſteries</hi> is nothing, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.2.</p>
                  <p>And how can you better do this, than by making them ſenſible of the Doctrine preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, which is Gods appointed Ordinance for converſion; and when can you better do it, than on the <hi>Evening</hi> after it was Preached? It may be you pray, and repeat the Sermon with them; you do ſo far well; but do you know, that they go alone, when you have done, to meditate and pray to God, <hi>to apply it by his Spirit, and give them Grace to keep it, and to keep them from walking contrary to</hi>
                     <pb n="35" facs="unknown:001573_0020_0FB3DB69960ECA20"/>
this and that particular <hi>Truth which they now learned;</hi> which if they do not, what are they the better for all? What Life is in them? But he that does not thus himſelf, has no heart to recommend it to others. If by this practice you win a Child to Repentance, you have got him a better Portion, than if you had made him a King. But what of this is done, when all go into Frolicks! Is there no time in the week for young People to ſee each other with <hi>Civility</hi> but this? Is not ſuch a Cuſtom deviſed by the Devil, on purpoſe for his <hi>Defence</hi> againſt the Sword of the Spirit, (the Word of God) which ſhould overthrow his Kingdom? But ſome are diſpleaſed with this Doctrine, and others do not much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard it. I fear the reaſon is, becauſe the Devil knows that the Cuſtom it contends with, is his ſtrong hold. However, this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter concerns Peoples Salvation and Damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, mind it or not.</p>
