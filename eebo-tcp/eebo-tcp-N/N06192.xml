            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>SIR,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>WE have preſumed to put the following Sheets under your Protection, tho' we have not the Honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing perſonally known to you, nor have applied to you for the Liberty of uſing your celebrated Name on this Occaſion.</p>
            <p>As this Book is a faithful Extract from the Journals of two <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seamen, late Officers in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſty's Navy, we thought we could not more properly dedicate it than to a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Admiral.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:007859_0006_102DDA40DE6207C8"/>
We know your Deteſtation of Flattery; and you know, from long Experience, that a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Seaman hath a Spirit too brave to ſtoop to ſo degenerate a Practice.</p>
            <p>The following Pages we hope will recommend themſelves to you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are written in a plain maritime Stile, and void of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality and Prejudice.</p>
            <p>The Diſtreſſes mention'd in this Book have perhaps not been equal'd in our Age; and we queſtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Navigators living have, for ſo long a Continuance, ſuffer'd ſuch Variety of Hardſhips, as the unfortunate People of the <hi>Wager.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After ſurviving the Loſs of the Ship, and combating with Famine, and innumerable Difficulties, a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of us are return'd to our Native Country; but even here we are ſtill unfortunate, deſtitute of Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:007859_0007_102DDA4363135EC0"/>almoſt without Support, or any Proſpect of being reſtor'd to our Stations, till ſome important Que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtions are decided, which cannot be cleared up till the Arrival of our late Captain, or at leaſt the Commodore.</p>
            <p>We, Sir, who preſent you with this Book, have been ſeveral Years in the Navy, and thought ourſelves well acquainted with its Laws and Diſcipline, and have many Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates to produce, that we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways acted in Obedience to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; but the Proceedings of the Officers and People, ſince the Loſs of the Ship, are reckoned ſo dark and intricate, that we know not what to expect, nor what will be the Reſult of our Superiors Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
            <p>The only Conſolation we have in our preſent Anxiety, is placed in a Confidence of the unbias'd Integrity,
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:007859_0008_102DDA4553F72908"/>Juſtice, and Humanity of the Right Honourable Perſons who will One Day determine for or againſt us.</p>
            <p>When you read our Account of the Affair, you'll find the Facts impartially related, the whole Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative written without the leaſt Shadow of Prejudice or Malice, and no more in Favour of ourſelves than of the other Officers concern'd: We ſtand or fall by the Truth; if Truth will not ſupport us, nothing can.</p>
            <p>In our Voyage from the <hi>Brazil</hi> to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> we were oblig'd <hi>to you for the generous Treatment we met with from an Enemy, a Subject of</hi> Spain, <hi>a Perſon of Diſtinction, and a Paſſenger in the ſame Ship:</hi> Your Virtues have procured you the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem even of your Enemies.</p>
            <p>Your Zeal for the <hi>National Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> deſerves the Love of every <hi>Honeſt Briton:</hi> To leave an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant

            <p>AS an Introduction, we think proper to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Reader with our Reaſons for cauſing the following Sheets to be made publick to the World. The chief Motive, which induced us to this Taſk, was to clear our Characters, which have been exceedingly blemiſh'd by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who (next to Heaven) owe the Preſervation of their Lives to our Skill, and indefatigable Care; and who having an Opportunity of arriving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us in <hi>England,</hi> have endeavour'd to raiſe their Reputation on the Ruin of Ours.</p>
            <p>It will appear to the Reader, on Peruſal of the following Pages, that this Journal was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to he taken from us by Violence at <hi>Rio Janeiro;</hi> that we have preſerved it, at the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of our Lives; that there was no Journal kept after the Loſs of the Ship, by any Officers but ourſelves; and if we had not been careful in making Remarks on each Day's Tranſactions, Perſons muſt have continued in the Dark, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to all the ſubſequent Proceedings.</p>
            <p>

It is a very uſual Thing to publiſh Voyages, eſpecially when the Navigators have met with any extraordinary Events. We believe, our Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, though it was not a Secret, is allowed to be an extraordinary One, and conſequently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with extraordinary Events: Indeed while the Commodore was with us, every thing went well, but when the Squadron ſeparated, Things began to have a new Face; after the Loſs of the <hi>Wager,</hi> there was a general Diſorder and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion among the People, who were now no longer implicitly obedient. There were two Seamen par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, who propogated this Confuſion, they ſaid they had ſuffer'd Ship-wreck in his Majeſty's Ship the <hi>Biddeford,</hi> and received no Wages from the Day that the Ship was loſt; that when they were out of Pay, they look'd upon themſelves as their own Maſters, and no longer ſubjected to Command. The People however were not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether infected, but ſtill continued to pay a duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Reſpect to their Commander; but when the Captain had raſhly ſhot Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> (whoſe Fate the Reader will find particularly related) they then grew very turbulent and unruly, the Captain daily loſt the Love of the Men, who with their Affection loſt their Duty.</p>
            <p>Our confining the Captain is reckoned an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious and unprecedented Action, and our not bringing him home with us, is reckon'd worſe;
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:007859_0012_102DDA4F1BD20648"/>but the Reader will find that Neceſſity abſolutely compell'd us to act as we did, and that we had ſufficient Reaſons for leaving him behind.</p>
            <p>Our Attempt for Liberty in ſailing to the Southward through the Streights of <hi>Magellan</hi> with ſuch a Number of People, ſlow'd in a Long Boat, has been cenſur'd as a mad Undertaking: Deſperate Diſeaſes require deſperate Remedies; had we gone to the Northward, there appear'd no Probability of eſcaping the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and when we had fallen into their Hands, 'tis not unlikely but they might have employed us as Drudges in their Mines for Life, therefore we rather choſe to encounter all Difficulties than to become Slaves to a mercileſs Enemy.</p>
            <p>Some Perſons have objected againſt our Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for keeping a Journal of this Nature; but ſeveral Judges of Maritime Affairs, allow this Work to be exact and regular. We think, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons with a common Share of Underſtanding are capable of committing to Paper daily Remarks of Matters worthy their Obſervation, eſpecially of Facts in which they themſelves had ſo large a Share. We only relate ſuch Things as could not poſſibly eſcape our Knowledge, and what we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually know to be true. We don't ſet up for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turaliſts and Men of great Learning, therefore have avoided meddling with Things above our Capacity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:007859_0013_102DDA51C66EA310"/>
We are alſo condemn'd by many for being too buſy and active for Perſons in our Stations. There was a Neceſſity for Action, and a great deal of it too; and had we been as indolent and regardleſs for the Preſervation of the People, as others who were ſuperior in Command, there would not have been ſo many who were ſhipwreck'd in the <hi>Wager,</hi> now in <hi>England</hi> to give a Relation of the Matter.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman who commanded in the Long-Boat on his Arrival before us at <hi>Liſbon,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented us to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchants in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vile Light, we were even adviſed by ſome of our Friends there not to return to our Country, leſt we ſhould ſuffer Death for Mutiny. But when the Gentlemen of the Factory had perus'd our Journal, they found, if there was any Mutiny in the Caſe, the very Perſon who accuſed us, was the Ringleader and chief Mutineer. We were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of our own Innocence, and determin'd to ſee our Country at all Events, being poſitive that we have acted to the beſt of our Underſtandings, in all Reſpects, for the Preſervation of our Lives and Liberties; and when our Superiors ſhall think proper to call us to an Account, which we expect will be at the Commodore's Arrival, we do not doubt but we ſhall clear ourſelves in ſpite of all invidious Reflections and malicious Imputations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:007859_0014_102DDA545CFC5960"/>
It has been hinted to us, as if publiſhing this Journal would give Offence to ſome Perſons of Diſtinction. We can't conceive how any Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions relating to the <hi>Wager,</hi> although made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo publick, can give Offence to any Great M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n at Home. Can it be any Offence to tell the World that we were ſhip-wreck'd in the <hi>Wager,</hi> when all People know it already? Don't they know that the <hi>Wager</hi> was one of his Majeſty's Store-Ships? That we had on Board not only Naval Stores but other Stores of an immenſe Value? Don't they alſo know that we went abroad with Hopes of acquiring great Riches, but are return'd Home as poor as Beggars? We are guilty of no indecent Reproaches, or unmannerly Reflections; though, it is certain, we cannot but lament our being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in ſo fatal an Expedition. When Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons have ſurmounted great Difficulties, it is a Pleaſure for them to relate their Story; and if we give ourſelves this Satisfaction, who has any Cauſe to be offended? Are we, who have faced Death in ſo many Shapes, to be intimidated, leſt we ſhould give Offence to the—Lord knows whom? We never ſaw a ſatyrical Journal in our Lives, and we though that Kind of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was the moſt obnoxious to give Offence.</p>
            <p>It has been a Thing uſual, in publiſhing of Voyages, to introduce abundance of Fiction; and ſome Authors have been eſteem'd merely for being
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:007859_0015_102DDA567569FB10"/>marvelous. We have taken Care to deviate from thoſe, by having a ſtrict Regard to Truth. There are undoubtedly in this Book ſome Things which will appear incredible. The Account given of the <hi>Patagonian Indians,</hi> and our own Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes, tho' ever ſo well atteſted, will not eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtain Credit; and People will hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Human Nature could poſſibly ſupport the Miſeries that we have endured.</p>
            <p>All the Difficulties related we have actually endur'd, and perhaps muſt endure more: Till the Commodore's Arrival we cannot know our Fate; at preſent we are out of all Employment, and have nothing to ſupport ourſelves and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, but the Profits ariſing from the Sale of our Journal; which perhaps may be the Sum Total we ſhall ever receive for our <hi>Voyage to the South-Seas</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">By what is added to this <hi>Second Edition,</hi> it will appear, that after the Arrival of the Captain, the Officers were try'd for the Loft of the Ship, and being all acquitted, except Lieutenant <hi>Beans,</hi> they were paid their Wages to the Time the Ship was wreck'd.</note>.</p>

               <hi>Tueſday, November</hi> the 4th, Captain <hi>Kidd</hi> our Commander was removed on board the <hi>Pearl,</hi> and the Honourable Captain <hi>Murray</hi> ſucceeded him in the <hi>Wager.</hi> Captain <hi>Norris</hi> of the <hi>Glouceſter</hi> having obtained Leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>England,</hi> on account of his ill State of Health, occaſioned the above removals.</p>
            <p>While we lay at <hi>Madeira,</hi> we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of ten Sail of Ships cruiſing off and on, to the Weſtward; theſe Ships were judg'd to be <hi>French,</hi> and had been ſeen every Day for a Week before our Arrival: The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore ſent out a Privateer Sloop, but ſhe returned the Day following, without ſeeing 'em; ſo that we can give no Account of 'em.</p>

On the 18th, the North End of the Iſland of St. <hi>Catharine</hi> bore N. W. by W. diſtant ſeven Leagues; and the Iſland of <hi>Gaul</hi> bore N. W. diſtant ſix Leagues.</p>
            <p>On the 19th we anchor'd in St. <hi>Catharine</hi>'s Bay in upward of twelve Fathom Water, the Iſland <hi>Gaul,</hi> on the Coaſt of <hi>Brazil,</hi> bearing N. by E. diſtant four Leagues.

            <p>On the 27th came in a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Brig from <hi>Rio Janeiro,</hi> for the <hi>Rio Grand:</hi> While we lay here, the People were generally imploy'd in over-hauling the rigging, and getting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board Water.</p>
            <p>On the 17th of <hi>January</hi> 1741, we ſailed from St. <hi>Catharine</hi>'s; the Commodore ſaluted the Fort with eleven Guns, the Fort returned the ſame Number.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 22d we loſt ſight of the <hi>Pearl.</hi>

            <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 17th of <hi>February,</hi> the <hi>Pearl</hi> join'd the Squadron; and on the 19th we came to Anchor off the river of St. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s, on the Coaſt of <hi>Patagonia,</hi> St. <hi>Julian</hi>'s

            <p>Captain <hi>Kidd</hi> was heard to ſay, a few Days before his Death, That this Voyage, which both Officers and Sailors had engag'd in, with ſo much Cheerfulneſs and Alacrity, would prove in the End very far from their Expectations, notwithſtanding the vaſt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they imagined to gain by it; that it would end in Poverty, Vermin, Famine, Death and Deſtruction.

            </p>
            <p>On the 26th of <hi>February</hi> we ſent on Board the <hi>Pearl</hi> twelve Butts and two Puncheons of Water; the <hi>Pearl</hi> having, while ſhe was ſeparated from us, been chaſed by five large <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Men of War, the Commander in Chief being diſtinguiſh'd by a red broad <hi>Pendant</hi> with a Swallow's Tail at his Main-top-maſt Head, and a red Flag at his Enſign-ſtaff:

While we lay at St. <hi>Julian</hi>'s, we ſaw the Sea full of Shrimps, and red as if they were boiled; the Water appeared tinctured to that Degree, that it look'd like Blood.</p>
            <p>On the 27th, we ſent on board the <hi>Pearl</hi> four Puncheons of Water more; at Six in the Morning, the Commodore made Signal to weigh; at Eight weigh'd, and came to Sail; this Day we loſt Sight of the <hi>Glouceſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 28th, the <hi>Glouceſter</hi> came into the Squadron again.</p>

            <p>On the 10th we loſt ſight of the <hi>Ann</hi> Pink, on the 12th carried away the rails and Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Head on both Sides.</p>
            <p>On the 16th the <hi>Ann</hi> Pink join'd the Squa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron again.</p>
            <p>The 30th the <hi>Glouceſter</hi> broke her Main-Yard in the Slings.</p>

               </gap>aſt Night feel in with two ſmall Iſlands; at Eight in the Morning the Iſlands bore N. N. W. by the Compaſs, diſtant eight Leagues, in the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:007859_0040_102DDA8EAE90B720"/>Latitude 54.00 South; we took 'em for the Iſlands which lay off <hi>Brewer's Streights,</hi> Lati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude 54.50 South, Long. 84.56 Weſt.</p>
            <p>On the 12th we had very hard Gales at Weſt, with the largeſt Swell I ever ſaw; I was Officer of the Watch (tho' I was Gunner of the Ship, I had the Charge of a Watch during the whole Voyage;) we had our Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board Tacks on Board: Between Six and Seven in the Morning, holding by the Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail Hallyards to Wind-ward, there broke a Sea in the Ship, which carried me over the Wheel, bilg'd the Cutter, and canted her off the Skeets Bottom up athwart the Barge; it likewiſe half filled the Long-Boat; the Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwain was for heaving the Cutter over-board, I order'd him to do nothing with her till I had acquainted the Captain, who was then very ill in his Cabbin: The Captain deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me to uſe all Means to ſave the Cutter; at the ſame Time I asked Leave to ſkuttle the Long-Boat, and get the Sprit-ſail Yard and Jib in, for fear of endangering the Bowſprit; which he order'd to be done, and told me, it was a very great Misfortune that he ſhould be ill at ſuch a Time. When I came from the Captain, I found the Lieutenant on the Deck, got the Cutter in her Place, ſkuttled
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007859_0041_102DDA90F04B1150"/>the Long-Boat, and got the Sprit-ſail Yard and Jib-boom in. The Carpenter is ſtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board the <hi>Glouceſter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 13th, under reeft Courſes, the Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board Tacks; the Commodore being on the Weather Quarter, bore down under our Lee, and ſpoke, with us. He ask'd the Captain, If the Carpenter was return'd from the <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſter?</hi> The Captain anſwer'd, No; and am ſurpriz'd Capt. <hi>Mitchell</hi> ſhould detain him, when he knows I muſt want him about my Mizen-maſt. The Commodore told him he would ſpeak with the <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him on Board. He then ask'd the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Why he did not ſet the Main-top-ſail, and make more Sail? Capt. <hi>Cheap</hi> made Anſwer, My rigging is all gone, and broke fore and aft, and my People almoſt all taken ill, and down; but I will ſet him as ſoon as poſſible. The Commodore deſired he would, and make what Sail he could after him.</p>
            <p>The 14th, the Carpenter return'd from the <hi>Glouceſter,</hi> it being the only Day this Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night a Boat could live in the Sea. As ſoon as the Carpenter came on Board, he waited on the Captain, who order'd him to look on the Chain Plates and Chains, and to give his Opinion of the Maſt's going away. The
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007859_0042_102DDA932CD22EA0"/>Carpenter look'd as order'd, and gave Capt. <hi>Cheap</hi> for Anſwer, That the Chain Plates were all broke. The Captain ſhook his Head, and ſaid, Carpenter! That is not the Reaſon of the Maſt's going away. The Carpenter not willing, as the Maſt was gone, to lay it to any one's Miſmanagement, or to occaſion any Uneaſineſs about what was now paſt Prevention, fitted a Cap on the Stump of the Mizen-maſt, got up a lower Studding-ſame Time fix'd her Main-Yard;
ſail-Boom, of 40 Feet, and hoiſted a Sail to keep the Ship to.</p>
            <p>To-day, being the 19th, and the fineſt Day we had in theſe Seas, we were employ'd in repairing the rigging; we bent a new Main-Sail, and reeft him, as did the <hi>Ann</hi> Pink; the <hi>Glouceſter</hi> at the ſame Time fix'd her Main-Yard; the Commodore and <hi>Tryal</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a-head, and at a conſiderable Diſtance; between Four and Six at Night ſaw the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore's Light. At Six, being reliev'd by the Maſter, he could not ſee the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore's Light, tho' it was viſible to every one elſe on the Quarter-Deck: The Maſter perſiſted he could not ſee it; on which I went and acqauinted the Captain, who came upon Deck, and ſeeing the Light, ask'd the Maſter, Where his Eyes were? This was the laſt
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007859_0043_102DDA9514916568"/>Time I ever ſaw the Commodore. The Lieutenant having the firſt Watch loſt Sight of him at Nine o'Clock, and at Ten was oblig'd to hand the Fore-Sail; in the doing of which we loſt a Seaman over-board. We ſaw the <hi>Glouceſter.</hi> and <hi>Ann</hi> Pink a-ſtern in the Morning; but they were ſoon gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and out of Sight.</p>
            <p>The 21ſt, as I was in the Steward's room, <hi>Joſeph King,</hi> Seaman, came for a Pound of Bread. I heard him ask the Steward, If he thought they would be ſerv'd with the ſame Quantity of Water as before? Without waiting for an Anſwer, No, G—d d—n 'em; as the Commodore was parted, they ſhou'd find the Difference. Not knowing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of this, or by whom the Fellow might be ſpirited up, I acquainted the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with the Affair, who order'd me to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Brace of Piſtols charg'd with a Brace of Balls to every Officer in the Ship who wanted 'em, and to take no further Notice of the Matter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> the 1ſt. This Day the Officers were call'd, and their Opinions aſk'd concerning the beſt Bower-Anchor; reſolv'd to cut the Anchor away, for fear of endangering the Ship, there being no Poſſibility of ſecuring

            <p>Fourteen Days before the Loſs of the Ship, the Wind at S. and S. S. W. ſteer'd N. W. by N. and N. N. W. by the Compaſs: Laid the Ship to for the firſt four Nights; the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this I could not learn. I aſk'd the Lieutenant the reaſon of our bearing for the Land on a Lee Shore, when we had a fair Wind for our rendezvous, which I had always thought was for the Iſland of <hi>Juan Ferdinandez.</hi> The Lieutenant told me the rendezvous was alter'd to an Iſland in the Latitude of 44 S. Upon this I ſaid to the Lieutenant, This is a very great Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to us; that we can do nothing with the Ship in the Condition ſhe is in upon a Lee-ſhore; and am ſurpriz'd, that we ſhould be oblig'd to go there. The Lieutenant told me, he had ſaid every Thing he could to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade the Captain from it, but found him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd to go there. The fifth Night, and every Night after, made Sail; the Wind to the Weſtward. I never reliev'd the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but I aſk'd him, what he thought of a Lee-ſhore with the Ship in this Condition? he always reply'd, He could not tell. We
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007859_0045_102DDA9952CB7660"/>ſaw rock-weed in abundance paſs by the Ship. The Honourable <hi>John Byron,</hi> Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipman, being on the Quarter Deck, ſaid, We can't be far off the Land by theſe Weeds. The Lieutenant and Mate being by, I ſaid, Gentlemen, what can we do with the Ship in the miſerable Condition ſhe is in on a Lee-ſhore? The Leiutenant anſwer'd, When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have been with the Captain ſince our firſt lying to, I always perſwaded him to go for <hi>Juan Ferdinandez;</hi> therefore I would have you go to him, he may be perſwaded by you, tho' he will not by me. I ſaid, If that was the Caſe, my going to him is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs. In a Quarter of an Hour afterwards, the Captain ſent for me, and ſaid, Gunner! What Longitude have you made? I told him 82. 30. What diſtance do you reckon yourſelf off the Land? I anſwer'd, about 60 Leagues: But if the two Iſlands we ſaw are thoſe which are laid down in your Chart to lay off <hi>Brewer</hi>'s <hi>Streights,</hi> and the ſame Current continues with the Weſtern ſwell, we can't be above a third Part of the Diſtance off the Land. The Captain made Anſwer, as for the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, there is no Account to be given for 'em; ſometimes they ſet one Way, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times another. I ſaid, Sir, very true; but
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007859_0046_102DDA9B3979BAD8"/>as the Ship has been always under reeft Courſes, with the Mizen-Maſt gone, ſhe muſt wholly drive to Leeward, and nigher the Land than expected. The Captain then told me, I ſuppoſe you are not unacquainted of my rendezvous for the Iſland of <hi>Noſtra Signora Di Socora,</hi> in the Latitude of 44. I reply'd, Sir, the Ship is in a very bad Condition to come in with the Lee-ſhore; and if it is poſſible to bring the Ship to an Anchor, we ſhall never purchaſe him again. The Captain anſwer'd, I don't deſign to come to an Anchor; for there are no Soundings until you come within ſeven Leagues of the Land. I purpoſe to ſtand off and on twenty-four Hours; and if I don't ſee the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, or any of the Squadron in that Time, we will go for <hi>Juan Ferdinandez.</hi> To this I ſaid, Sir, the Ship is a perfect Wreck; our Mizen-Maſt gone, with our ſtanding rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging afore and abaft, and all our People down; therefore I can't ſee what we can do in with the Land. The Captain's Anſwer was, It does not ſignify, I am oblig'd and determin'd to go for the firſt rendezvous.</p>
            <p>On the 13th, at Eight in the Morning, the Straps of the Fore-Jeer Blocks broke; reeff'd the Top ropes, and lower'd the Yard; went
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007859_0047_102DDA9D60823848"/>to ſtrapping the Blocks. At Nine, the Carpenter going forward to inſpect the Chain-Plates, ſaw the Land from the Fore-Caſtle; on which he aſk'd the Boatſwain's Mate, who was by him, If he ſaw the Land? He anſwer'd, No. The Carpenter ſhew'd it him, and he ſaw it plain. The Carpenter then ſhew'd it to the Lieutenant; but he would not believe it to be Land, becauſe it bore N. N. W. and ſaid it was impoſſible; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he never inform'd the Captain of the Sight of Land, as the Honourable Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> hath heard the Captain ſay. At Two in the Afternoon lower'd the Fore-Yard, and hawl'd the Fore-ſail up. Notwithſtanding I was Officer of the Watch, I was oblig'd to go upon the Fore-Yard, where was Mr. <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi> Midſhipman, one Boatſwain's Mate, four Seamen, and the Maſter's Servant; which were all the Hands we could get out of the Ship's Company to aſſiſt. Whilſt on the Yard I ſaw the Land very plain, on the Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board-beam, bearing N. W. half N. neareſt High Land, with Hillocks, and one remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Hommacoe like a Sugar-loaf, very high. At the Sight of Land I came off the Fore-yard, and acquainted the Captain. He imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately gave Orders to ſway the Fore-yard
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007859_0048_102DDAA04C4C9710"/>up, and ſet the Fore-ſail; then we wore Ship, with her Head to the Southward. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain coming forward unhappily received a Fall, which diſlocated his Shoulder, ſo that he was obliged to be put into the Surgeon's Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin. Some Time after he ſent for the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant and myſelf, acquainting us of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity there was for making Sail, as being on a Lee-Shore; therefore deſired we would uſe our utmoſt Endeavours to crowd the Ship off. You ſee, Gentlemen, ſaid he, my Misfortune will not permit me to continue on the Deck: As for the Maſter, he is not worthy of the Charge of a Watch; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt deſire you Mr. <hi>Bulkely,</hi> to be in the Watch with him, and to make but two Watches: Keep a good Look-out, and, if poſſible, ſet the Main-top-ſail. Mr. <hi>Beans,</hi> I muſt deſire Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> to be with you; and beg you will take all the Care you can. I having the firſt Watch, ſet the Main, Fore and Mizen Stay-ſails; it blew ſo hard I found it impoſſible to ſet the Main-top-ſail; of which I acquainted the Captain: All the Hands we could muſter in both Watches, Officers included, were but twelve; the reſt of the Ship's Company were all ſick below: I very often could get no more than three
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007859_0049_102DDAA1E6709B50"/>Seaman in my Watch. The Ship for theſe three Weeks hath been no better than a Wreck; the Mizen-maſt gone; the ſtanding rigging and Chain-Plates, afore and abaft, moſtly broke and ruin'd. The Top-ſails now at the Yards are ſo bad, that if we attempt to looſe 'em for making Sail, we are in Danger of ſplitting 'em; and we have not a ſpare Sail in the Ship that can be brought to the Yard without being repair'd. This is the preſent deplorable Situation of the Ship. All the firſt and middle Watch it blow'd and rain'd; and withal ſo very dark, that we could not ſee the Length of the Ship: For the greateſt Part of the Night ſhe came up no nearer than S. by W. and S. S. W. At Four in the Morning ſhe came up with her Head Weſt; ſo that her Head was then off the Shore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday, May</hi> the 14th, 1741, at Half an Hour paſt Four this Morning, the Ship ſtruck abaft on a ſunken Rock, ſounded fourteen Fathom; but it being impoſſible to let go the Anchor Time enough to bring her up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſurrounded on every ſide with rocks (a very diſmal Proſpect to behold!) the Ship ſtruck a ſecond Time, which broke the Head of the Tiller; ſo that we were obliged to ſteer her with the Main and Fore-ſheets, by
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007859_0050_102DDAA4441C2B78"/>eaſing off one, and hawling aft the other, as ſhe came to, or fell off. In a ſhort Time after, ſhe ſtruck, bilged, and grounded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two ſmall Iſlands, where Providence directed us to ſuch a Place as we could ſave our Lives. When the Ship ſtruck it was about Break of Day, and not above a Muſket-ſhot from the Shore. Launch'd the Barge, Cutter, and Yaul over the Gunnel; cut the Main and Fore-Maſt by the Board, and the Sheet-Anchor from the Gunnel. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſent the Barge on Shore, with Mr. <hi>Snow</hi> the Mate, to ſee if the Place was inhabited, and to return aboard directly; but, without any regard to his Duty, or the Preſervation of the Lives of the People, he ſtaid aſhore. The Barge not returning as expected, the Lieutenant was ſent in the Yawl, with Orders to bring off the Barge. The Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant tarried aſhore, but ſent off the Boat. As ſoon as the Boat came on Board, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, being very iil, was perſuaded by the Officers to go aſhore: With the Captain went the Land Officers, Mate, and Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipmen; the Officers remaining on Board were the Maſter, Boatſwain, Gunner, and Carpenter: The Boatſwain, who was laid up a Month before the Loſs of the Ship, became
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007859_0051_102DDAA63229B490"/>of a ſudden very vigorous and active. At Night it blow'd very hard at North, with a great tumbling Sea; we expected every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the Ship would part, fetching ſuch Jirks and Twiſtings as ſhock'd every Perſon aboard, who had the leaſt Care for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of Life; yet, in the diſmal Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we were in, we had ſeveral in the Ship ſo thoughtleſs of their Danger, ſo ſtupid, and inſenſible of their Miſery, that upon the principal Officers leaving her, they fell into the moſt violent Outrage and Diſorder: They began with broaching the Wine in the Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto; then to breaking open Cabbins and Cheſts, arming themſelves with Swords and Piſtols, threatning to murder thoſe who ſhould oppoſe or queſtion them: Being drunk and mad with Liquor, they plunder'd Cheſts and Cabbins for Money and other Things of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, cloathed themſelves in the richeſt Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel they could find, and imagined themſelves Lords, Paramount.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> the 15th the Ship was bilged in the Mid-ſhips on a great rock; we took Care to ſecure ſome Powder, Ball, and a little Bread. In the Afternoon, the Carpenter and myſelf went aſhore with ſeveral of thoſe imaginary Lords in the rich Attire they had
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007859_0052_102DC6FA5369CD88"/>plunder'd Yeſterday; but upon the Purſer and Lieutenant <hi>Hamilton</hi> of Marines preſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Piſtols to ſome of their Breaſts, thoſe Grandees ſuffer'd themſelves very quietly to be diſrob'd of all their Greatneſs, and in a few Minutes look'd like a Parcel of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported Felons. On our coming aſhore, we found the Captain had taken his Lodging in a little Hut, ſuppos'd to be built by <hi>Indians;</hi> as for our Parts, we were forced to take Shelter under a great Tree, where we made a large Fire; but it rain'd ſo hard, that it had almoſt coſt us our Lives; an Invalid died that very Night on the Spot. Before I left the Ship I went to my Cabbin for my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but could not find it; I believe it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd with the reſt, for there is not one Journal to be produced; we have good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to apprehend there was a Perſon employ'd to deſtroy them; I afterwards found Part of the Maſter's Journal along ſhore, tore to Pieces: Whatever is related in this Book, preceeding the Loſs of the <hi>Wager,</hi> is extracted from a Journal belonging to a Gentleman lately an Officer on Board the <hi>Pearl.</hi> After we loſt ſight of the <hi>Pearl,</hi> I was oblig'd to have recourſe to my Memory, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve has been very faithful to me. From
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007859_0053_102DDAA7EC2E8818"/>the Time we were Ship-wreck'd, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter and myſelf were exceeding careful in writing each Days Tranſactions: Had other Perſons taken the ſame Care, there would be no Neceſſity of impoſing upon the Publick a partial and inconſiſtent Narrative, inſtead of a faithful relation of Facts.</p>
            <p>On the 16th, the Weather very boiſterous, and a great Sea, the Boatſwain wanted a Boat; but finding no Appearance of any coming aboard, brought a Quarter-deck Gun, a four Pounder, to bear on the Captain's Hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>, and fir'd two Shot, which went juſt over the Captain's Tent. This Day, being reſolv'd to contrive ſomething like a Houſe, to ſecure us from the Inclemency of the rain, and Severity of the Weather, we hawl'd up the Cutter, and propping her up, we made a tolerable Habitation. As for Food this Iſland produces none; nor is there any Vegetable upon it but Cellery, which grows here in abundance, and is of great Uſe to us, the Men being in general very much troubled with the Scurvy.</p>
            <p>On the 17th of <hi>May,</hi> being <hi>Whitſunday,</hi> got ſeveral wild Fowls, and plenty of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Limpetts, and other Shell-fiſh, which we find very refreſhing, having ſubſiſted a long Time on nothing but Salt-proviſions.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:007859_0054_102DDAAAD9163DC0"/>
The 18th went on Board the Ship, to ſee if it was poſſible to come to any Proviſions; got out of the Lazaretto two Casks of Flouer and ſome Wine, which were very uſeful.</p>
            <p>On the 19th went aboard again to ſcuttle the Decks, in order to get ſome Beef and Pork out of the Hold; we alſo ſcuttled the Carpenter's Store-room, for Nails and other Things of Service.</p>
            <p>The 20th cut away the Gunnel, to get the Long Boat out; which was done. To-day we found ſeveral Men dead, and ſome drowned, in the Ship; ſuppos'd to have drank till they were not able to get from the Water, as it flowed into the Ship. While we were aboard working on the Wreck, there came a-long ſide a Canoe with ſeveral <hi>Indians,</hi> bowing and croſſing themſelves, giving us to underſtand they were inclinable to the <hi>Romiſh</hi> religion; we gave 'em out of the Ship two Bales of Cloth, and ſent them aſhore to the Captain; he gave them Hats, and preſented each of them with a Soldier's Coat. They had Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the largeſt and beſt Muſcles I ever ſaw, or taſted. This Day was the firſt Time of the Boatſwain's coming aſhore; the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain called him rogue and Villain, and felled him to the Ground with his Cane, ſo that he
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:007859_0055_102DDAACE4477DA8"/>was motionleſs, and to Appearance dead; when he had recovered the Blow, and ſaw a cockt Piſtol in the Captain's Hand, he offered his naked Breaſt; the Captain told him, he deſerved to be ſhot, and ſaid no more to him. The Captain, Lieutenant <hi>Hamilton</hi> of Marines, the Surgeon, and Purſer, always appear'd in Arms on the Beach, on the coming aſhore of every Boat, in order to prevent the People bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Thing from the Ship in a clandeſtine Manner; they were ſo cautious of any Thing being imbezzled, that they would not ſuffer the Boats to go off and work by Night, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the Moon, Tides, and Fairneſs of Weather were more favourable to us by Night than Day; by this we omitted ſeveral Opportunities of getting out Proviſions, and other uſeful Things, which we ſhall ſhortly ſtand in great Need of.</p>
            <p>The 21ſt, continued to ſcuttle between Decks; in getting Neceſſaries out of the Ship, found ſeveral Men dead.</p>
            <p>The 22d, the <hi>Indians</hi> brought us three Sheep, and ſome Muſcles. They are a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of a ſmall Stature, well ſhaped, of an Olive Complexion, with black Hair; in Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour very civil: they have little Cloaths, except about their Waiſts, notwithſtanding
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:007859_0056_102DDAAEB632B1E0"/>the Climate is exceſſive cold. They ſtay'd all Night, it being very rainy Weather, and has been ever ſince we have been here, the Wind blowing from North to N. W.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> the 23d, the Wind from the E. N. E. to North, fell Abundance of Snow, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſomuch that the Mountains are cover'd with it. It freezes very hard, and we find it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly cold.

            <p>The 25th, little Wind at N. E. and froſty Weather, went aboard again, and got out of the Forehold eight Barrels of Flour, one Cask of Peaſe, with ſome Brandy and Wine. This Day went to Allowance, of half a Pound of Flour <hi>per</hi> Man, and one Piece of Pork for three Men, it being the firſt Time of ſerving ſince on Shore.</p>
            <p>The 26th, we got out more Casks of Flour, one Cask of Oatmeal, with ſome Brandy and Wine. In the Evening the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans</hi> came with their Wives, we gave the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men Hats, and the Men Breeches; they made Signs as if they would bring more Sheep.</p>
            <p>On the 27th, we ſcuttled over the Captain's Store-room, got out ſeveral Casks of rum and Wine, and brought them aſhore. This
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:007859_0057_102DDAB0665F8C20"/>was the firſt Time of the Lieutenant's being between Decks ſince the Loſs of the Ship. The following Day we went aboard, cut down and toſt over-board the Ship's Awning, to make a Deck for the Long Boat.</p>
            <p>Since the 27th, we have been employ'd in getting up the Long Boat, and repairing the Barge which had been ſtove aſhore; rainy Weather.</p>

An Information was given, this Day, by <hi>David Buckley,</hi> to the Captain, that there was a Deſign to blow him up, with the Surgeon, and Lieutenant <hi>Hamilton</hi> of Marines.

            <p>The 5th, we went on Board the Ship, found ſeveral Caſks of Wine and Brandy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Decks, moſt Part of the Planks be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Decks gone, and ſome Strakes to Wind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward ſtarted out, Part of the upper Deck blown up, the Stumps of the Maſts and Pumps riſen five Feet; brought aſhore the Cask of Flour, with ſome Stuff for the Uſe of the Long Boat; and two Quarter Caſks of Wine; the Wind at S. by E.</p>

               </gap>y the Captain; the Fault alledg'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt him was Drunkenneſs. We learn from <hi>Nicholas Griſelham,</hi> Seaman, who was preſent and near the Captain all the Time, that as Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> was rowling up a ſleep Beach, a Caſk of Peaſe, he found it too heavy for him, and left off rowling; the Captain ſeeing this, told him, he was drunk, Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> reply'd, With what ſhould I get drunk, unleſs it be with Water? The Captain then ſaid, You Scoundrel, get more Hands, and rowl the Caſk up: <hi>Cozens</hi> called for more Hands, but no People came; with that the Captain ſtruck him with his Cane. <hi>Griſelham</hi> likewiſe ſays, that <hi>Cozens</hi> talked to the Captain about one Capt. <hi>Shelvock;</hi> but the Words he does not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. But the ſame Night I heard Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> uſe very unbecoming Language to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, telling him, That he was come into thoſe Seas to pay <hi>Shelvock</hi>'s Debts; and alſo inſolently added, Tho' <hi>Shelvock</hi> was a rogue, he was not a Fool; and, by G—d, you are both. When he ſpoke this, he was a Priſoner in the Store Tent, and aſked the Captain, If he was to be kept there all Night? On theſe Provocations, the Captain attempted to ſtrike him again; but the Centinel ſaid,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:007859_0060_102DDAB634CF68C0"/>he ſhould ſtrike no Priſoner of his. But <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens</hi> endeavouring to ſtave a Caſk of Brandy, was ſoon after releaſed. This Day got out of the Ship ſeveral Cheſts of Wax Candles of all Sizes, Bales of Cloth, Bales of Stockings, Shoes, with ſome Clocks, and mercantile Ware, with which this Ship was throng'd.</p>
            <p>The 8th, Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> and myſelf went to the Deſerters; we find they are determined to go off to the Northward; the reaſon of their Stay is the Want of Craft to go off in. They now find themſelves miſtaken, they believed at firſt they were on the Main, but are convinced they are four or five Leagues from it, therefore they purpoſe to build a Punt out of the Wreck of the Ship: They live on Sea Weed and Shell Fiſh; got up one Caſk of Beef, which was brought on Shore with a Caſk of Brandy, found one Caſk of Beef on the rocks.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 9th, I went with the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's Mate to the Deſerters, and ſpoke to <hi>William Oram,</hi> a Carpenter, and a very uſeful Man, deſiring him to return, with a Promiſe of Pardon from the Captain: In this Affair I was obliged to Act very ſecretly. To-day, Mr. <hi>Cozens,</hi> the Midſhipman, had a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with the Surgeon; the latter having
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:007859_0061_102DDAB7D69B5698"/>ſome Buſineſs in our Tent, which when he had done, on his going away, Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> followed him; they ſoon fell to Blows, but the Surgeon had ſo much the Advantage of the Midſhipman, that he tied his Hands be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind him and left him. In the Evening the Captain ſent for me and the Carpenter to his Tent: We found with the Captain, the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, Purſer, Surgeon, and Lieutenant <hi>Hamilton</hi> of Marines. Here we had a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſultation, which was chiefly concerning the Diſturbances among the People, as well in our Tent as in the reſt. Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> and I aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Captain, that the People in our Tent were generally very well affected to him, and that we never would engage in any Mutiny againſt him, or any other Officer that would act for the publick Good, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Service: The Captain ſaid, he had no reaſon to ſuſpect us, for we were the only two in the Ship, that he put any Truſt or Confidence in; ſtrict Orders were given the Centinel to keep a good Look-out, and have a watchful Eye on the Proviſions; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all this Precaution and Care, there was one third Part of a Barrel of Flour, and half a Barrel of Gunpowder taken away that Night. It is to be obſerved, that this
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:007859_0062_102DDAB9C93D8E08"/>Day's Conſultation was the firſt that Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> ever had with his Officers; had he ſometimes conſulted them aboard, we might probably have eſcaped our preſent unhappy Condition.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 10th, This Day, ſerving the Proviſions, the Boatſwain's Servant, a <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Boy, talking bad <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and bringing in the Allowance of Wine, the Boatſwain, Mr. <hi>Cozens,</hi> Midſhipman, and the Cook his Meſſ-mates, with ſome Difficulty, underſtood by the Boy's Talk, that one of the Men had his Allowance ſtopped; Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> went to know the reaſon; the Purſer and he having ſome Diſpute two or three Days before, the Purſer told him, when he aſked for his Wine, that he was come to Mutiny, and, without any further Ceremony, diſchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a Piſtol at his Head, and would have ſhot him, had he not been prevented by the Cooper's canting the Piſtol with his Elbow, at the Inſtant of its going off; the Captain, and Lieutenant <hi>Hamilton,</hi> hearing the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the Piſtol, the latter ran out with a Firelock, then called the Captain out of his Tent, telling him that <hi>Cozens</hi> was come to Mutiny; the Captain on this jumped out, aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where the Villain was, clapped a cock'd
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:007859_0063_102DDABC1A5685F0"/>Piſtol to Mr, <hi>Cozens</hi>'s Cheek, and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tately ſhot him, without aſking any Queſtions; the Noiſe of the two Piſtols going off, reached our Tent; it was rainy Weather, and not fit for Gunning, ſo that we could not imagine the Meaning of it; ſoon after we heard Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> was ſhot by the Captain: The Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant came to call all Hands to the Captain; I aſked if we muſt go armed; the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant anſwered, yes; but, on Conſideration, I thought better to go without Arms: When we came to the Captain, he acquainted us with what he had done, and told us he was ſtill our Commander. The Captain, Purſer, Surgeon, Lieutenants <hi>Hamilton, Ewers,</hi> and <hi>Fielding</hi> of Marines being all armed, I ſaid to the Captain, Sir, you ſee we are diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed; on this the Captain dropped his Firelock to the Ground, ſaying, I ſee you are, and have only ſent for you, to let you all know I am ſtill your Commander, ſo let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man go to his Tent; accordingly every Man obey'd him. In our Tent we had eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of the ſtouteſt Fellows that belonged to the Ship; and I believe the Captain, and the Gentlemen above-mentioned, have ſome Suſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> and myſelf, believing we can ſway moſt of the Seamen on Shore:
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:007859_0064_102DDABDB4989598"/>But I think this Day we have given a Proof of the Sincerity of our Intentions, and our Deteſtation of Mutiny, by not appearing in Arms at the report of Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> being ſhot; we walked up with the Captain, where we ſaw Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> with his Elbow on the Ground reſting his right Cheek on the Palm of his Hand, alive, and to Appearance ſenſible, but ſpeechleſs; the Captain ordered him to the ſick Tent, the Surgeon's Mate dreſſed his left Cheek where he was ſhot, and felt a Ball about three Inches under his right Eye; the Surgeon refuſed dreſſing him; this we may impute to his having lately a Quarrel with Mr. <hi>Cozens,</hi> which has been already mentioned. The ſhooting of Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> was a very unhappy Affair: the Perſon whoſe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance was ſtopped, made no Complaint to him, he was too officious in the Buſineſs, and his preceeding Behaviour, and notorious diſreſpectful Words to the Captain, might probably make the Captain ſuſpect his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was Mutiny; tho' this we muſt aver, that Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> neither on this, or any other Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion, appeared in Arms ſince the Loſs of the Ship: However, his Fate laid the Foundation of a great deal of Miſchief which afterwards followed.</p>

Dr. <hi>Oakly,</hi> of the Land Forces, was deſired to aſſiſt the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon's Mate, to take the Ball out of Mr. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens</hi>'s Cheek, which he then was inclinable to do; but in the Afternoon finding it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Captain, refuſed to go, as we are informed by the Surgeon's Mate, who deſired ſome Surgeon might be preſent, to be Witneſs of the Operation; the Ball was taken out, and for ſome time ſuppoſed to be loſt, but was afterwards found.</p>
            <p>This Day being the 12th, the Carpenter finiſhed the Blocks for lengthening the Long-Boat; in the Morning he went to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's Tent for ſome Bolts for the Uſe of the Long-Boat, where he ſaw the Surgeon at the Medicine-Cheſt, who asked him how that unfortunate Creature did, meaning Mr. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens;</hi> the Carpenter told him he had not ſeen him To-day: The Surgeon then ſaid he would have viſited him, but the Captain would not give him Leave. This was looked on as an Act of Inhumanity in the Captain, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed very much to his loſing the Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the People, whoſe Opinion was, that as Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> was very ſtrong and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:007859_0066_102DDAC239A44190"/>with proper Aſſiſtance, he might reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; the People did not ſcruple to ſay that the Captain would act a more honourable Part to diſcharge another Piſtol at him, and diſpatch him at once, than to deny him relief, and ſuffer him to languiſh in a cold wet Place in Pain and Miſery.</p>
            <p>On the 13th, Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> being, to all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Appearance, likely to recover, deſired he might be removed to our Tent, which was his Place of reſidence before this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Accident: We being unwilling to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige the Captain, the Carpenter and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf waited on him; we told him, we were come to ask a Favour, hoping that he would have ſo much Mercy and Compaſſion on the unhappy Man who was in the ſick Tent, as to permit us to remove him to his former Lodging; but the Captain anſwer'd, No; I am ſo far from it, that, if he lives, I will carry him a Priſoner to the Commodore, and hang him.</p>
            <p>On the 14th, went aboard the Ship, but could do nothing, ſhe working ſo very much; we brought aſhore the Fore-top-ſail Yard; the Boat went up the river, brought back Abundance of Geeſe and Shaggs. Wind at Weſt.</p>

            <p>On the 17th, the Carpenter at Work on the Long Boat: The Surgeon's Mate this Day took out of Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi>'s Cheek a Ball much ſlatted, and a Piece of Bone, ſuppoſed to be Part of the Upper Jaw, which was deſired by Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> to be deliver'd to me; I receiv'd it, with the firſt Ball mention'd to have been loſt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 18th, the Carpenter cut the Long-Boat in two, and lengthen'd her eleven Feet ten Inches and half by the Keel.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday</hi> the 21ſt, went aboard the Ship; but it being dangerous going about any
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:007859_0068_102DDAC64E788760"/>Thing, by reaſon of her working much, and a great Sea tumbling in, the Boats were employ'd in going about the rocks in Search of Subſiſtence.</p>
            <p>The 22d, the Carpenter went with the Boat up the Bay to ſeek the <hi>Indians,</hi> but ſaw nothing of them; at Night the Boat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, the People having ſhot. Abundance of wild Fowl.</p>
            <p>The 23d, the Lieutenant went with the Boat, and found the <hi>Indians</hi> juſt come from the Place where they catch Seal; their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes were loaded with Seal, Sheep, and Oil.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 24th, departed this Life Mr. <hi>Henry Cozens,</hi> Midſhipman, after lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing fourteen Days with the Wound he had receiv'd in his Cheek: We bury'd him in as decent a Manner as Time, Place, and Circumſtances would allow. There have died ſundry Ways ſince the Ship firſt ſtruck, forty-five Men; ſeven have deſerted from us, and ſtill continue away; remain and now victual'd one hundred Men.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 25th, the Wind at W. N. W. and rainy Weather; ſaw the <hi>Indians</hi> coming towards us in their Canoes; but the Deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ſettling where they took their Habitation when firſt we ſaw 'em, by their rowing, we
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:007859_0069_102DDAC8447C4CD8"/>thought they were deſign'd to go there; and knowing the Deſerters intended to take one of their Canoes to go over to the Main, we therefore launch'd the Yawl and went off to them; there were five Canoes of 'em, laden with Seal, Shell-fiſh, and four Sheep; they brought with 'em their Wives and Children, ſo that in all they were about fifty in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; they hawl'd their Canoes up, and built four Wigwams, which they cover'd with the Bark of Trees and Seal-ſkins; we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd by this they had an Intention to ſettle with us; they are a very ſimple and inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive People, of a low Stature, flat nos'd, with their Eyes ſunk very deep in their Heads; they live continually in Smoak, and are never without a Fire, even in their Canoes; they have nothing to cover their Nakedneſs, but a Piece of an old Blanket, which they throw over their Shoulders: We always ſee 'em in this Manner, notwithſtanding we cloath 'em whenever they come to us. By the Croſſes ſet up in many Parts of the Land, one would think they had ſome Notion of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> religion: We can't make 'em underſtand us by any Speech, nor by our Signs; we ſhow'd 'em a looking Glaſs; when they ſaw the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation of themſelves, they ſeem'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd,
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:007859_0070_102DDACA568916B8"/>and ſhow'd a thouſand antick Geſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and when once they beheld themſelves in the Looking-Glaſs, they could hardly be prevail'd on to look off.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> the 28th, in the Afternoon, about twelve of the <hi>Indian</hi> Women went off in their Canoes: We thought they were gone to get Muſcles, but ſoon ſaw 'em diving; which we imagin'd was for Pieces of Beef or Pork that came out of the Wreck; but when they came aſhore, we found they had been only diving for Sea-Eggs. The Women among thoſe People ſeem to take more Pains for the Proviſions of Life than the Men; the latter having little to do but to provide Wood, and indulge themſelves by the Fire, while the Women go every Tide a Fiſhing. To-day we kill'd two <hi>Indian</hi> Sheep.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> the 29th, launch'd the Yawl to go with the <hi>Indians</hi> to ſhew us where they get the Muſcles; but being too late for the Tide, we came away without any: The Captain ſent to our Tent two Quarters of Mutton; the Carpenter daily at Work on the Long-Boat. Winds variable.</p>
            <p>On the 30th, the <hi>Indian</hi> Women went again for Sea Eggs, and brought a great Quantity, with Abundance of white Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:007859_0071_102DDACC949AB050"/>about three Quarters of an Inch in Length, and in Circumference the Bigneſs of a Wheat-ſtraw. Theſe Women keep an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Time under Water, with a ſmall Baſket in their Hands, about the Size of the Womens Work-baſkets in <hi>England,</hi> into which they put whatever they get in their diving. Among theſe People the Order of Nature ſeems inverted; the Males are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empted from Hardſhips and Labour, and the Women are meer Slaves and Drudges. This Day one of our Seamen died: We obſerve, the <hi>Indians</hi> are very watchful of the Dead, ſitting continually near the above mention'd Corpſe, and carefully covering him; every Moment looking on the Face of the Deceas'd with abundance of Gravity: At the Burial their Deportment was grave and ſolemn; ſeeing the People with their Hats off during the Service, they were very attentive and obſervant, and continued ſo till the Burial was over: They have nothing, as I have ſaid before, but a Blanket to cover 'em, and the Boys and Girls are quite naked, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding we felt it as cold here, as in the hardeſt Froſts in <hi>England,</hi> and almoſt always rainy.</p>

               <hi>Wedneſday, July</hi> the 1ſt, employ'd in cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting Timbers in the Woods for the Long-Boat; rainy Weather: the Wind at S. W. the <hi>Indian</hi> Women diving for Food as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 2d, laſt Night the Store-Tent was broke open, and robbed of a great deal of Flour.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> the 6th, hard Gales of Wind, with Showers of rain and Hail; came aſhore from the Ship, one Caſk of Beef, with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of the Lower Deck Carlings, and Plank of the Upper and Lower Deck Beams; and, what was reckon'd very odd, the Cabbin-Bell came aſhore, without its being faſten'd to any Wood, or any one Thing of the Ship near it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 7th, hard Gales of Wind, with Hail, rain, and Lightning: The <hi>Indian</hi> Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men went out as uſual in their Canoes to dive for Sea Eggs, and brought aſhore Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of 'em; they jump over-board out of their Canoe about a Mile from Shore; they take the Handle of their Baſkets, which I have already deſcribed, between their Teeth, and dive in five or ſix Fathom Water; their Agility in Diving, and their Continuance under Water, for ſo long a Time as they
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:007859_0073_102DDAD054DAAB38"/>generally do, will be thought impoſſible by Perſons who have not been Eye-witneſſes of it; they ſeem as amphibious to us as Seals and Allegators, and rarely make uſe of any Proviſion but what they get out of the Sea.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 8th, launch'd the Yawl and went on Board; ſaw ſeveral Caſks, ſome of Meat, and ſome of Liquor; the Decks and Sides abaft drove out, and entirely gone; the Larboard Side abaft drove on ſhore; about two Miles and a half from the Tent a Caſk of Liquor was found, and broach'd by the Perſon who found it, which was allow'd to be a great Fault; he likewiſe broach'd a Caſk of Meat, which ſhould have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerv'd to carry away with us.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 9th, the <hi>Indians</hi> with their Wives and Children launch'd their Canoes, and went away; 'tis believ'd they wanted Proviſions, ſuch as Seal; they are indeed never ſettled long in a Place; it was ſaid ſome of our People wanted to have to do with their Wives, which was the reaſon of their going away ſo ſoon. To-day we ſaw ſeveral Things drive out of the Ship up the <hi>Lagoon,</hi> as the Stump of the Main-maſt, one of the Pumps, with one of the Gun-Carri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages. Wind at N. W.</p>

               <hi>Friday</hi> the 10th, went aboard the Ship, ſound her broke aſunder juſt at the Gang-Way; ſaw the Cables out to the Windward, but could not ſee any Caſks of Liquor or Proviſions; went to ſhorter Allowance of Flour, one Pound for three Men <hi>per Diem.</hi> Laſt Night the Tent was robbed of half a Barrel of Flour: Orders were given by the Captain to watch the Store-Tent by Night; all the Officers, the Marine included, with the Mates and Midſhipmen, were oblig'd to watch, the Captain and Carpenter alone ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cus'd, the Carpenter being every Day at work on the Long-Boat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> the 17th, for this Week paſt hard Gales of Wind, with rain and Hail as uſual. Laſt <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the Ship parted her Upper Works from the Lower Deck: Launch'd the Boat and went off to the Wreck, but could do nothing; went up the Bay; took a Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Caſk, about three Parts full of Wine; ſaw the <hi>Indian</hi> Dogs aſhore but no People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> the 18th, launched the Boat, ſent her to the Wreck, and brought aſhore one Caſk of Beef; it is believed ſome Guns were heard from the Sea: The Watch reported they have heard them two Nights paſt. Great

            <p>
               <hi>Sunday</hi> the 19th, launch'd the Boat, ſent her to the Wreck, hook'd a Caſk ſuppoſed to be Beef; but when towed aſhore, we found it contained nothing but Hatchets; we took up along Shore, Abundance of Cheque Shirts in Dozens, alſo Caps, Bales of Cloth, and Pieces of Beef and Pork.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 22d. This Day began to build a Houſe to dwell in, finding our Stay here, will be much longer than we at firſt expected.</p>
            <p>The 23d, took up along Shore ſeveral Pieces of Beef and Pork, Shirts, Caps, Frocks, Trowſers, Pieces of Cloth, with other ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable Things, and Wax Candles of all Sizes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> the 25th, hard Showers of rain and Hail; the Wind at North. Shot ſeveral Sea-Gulls, Geeſe, Hawks, and other Birds: The Carpenter had this Day given him by one of the People, a fine large rock-crab, it being the firſt of the Kind we ever ſaw here.</p>

               <hi>Sunday</hi> the 26th, moderate Gales and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riable Winds, with rain and Hail: Moſt Part of our People eat a Weed that grows on

            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> the 27th, launched the Beat, went to the Wreck, but found nothing; cloſe Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, the Wind ſtill at North; rais'd the Sheers for erecting a Tent over the Long-Boat to keep the Men from being expos'd to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual rains.

               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 29th, Freſh Gales at N.

<pb n="45" facs="unknown:007859_0077_102DDAD931577070"/>of the Invalids; there are now only two left, <hi>viz.</hi> the Captain and Surgeon. Being at the Honourable Mr. <hi>Byron</hi>'s Tent, I found him looking in Sir <hi>John Narborough</hi>'s Voyage to theſe Seas; this Book I deſired the Loan of he told me it was Captain <hi>Cheap</hi>'s, and did not doubt but he would lend it me; this, Favour I requeſted of the Captain, and it was preſently granted. Carefully peruſing this Book, I conceived an Opinion that our going through the <hi>Streights</hi> of <hi>Magellan</hi> for the Coaſt of <hi>Brazil,</hi> would be the only Way to prevent our throwing ourſelves into the Hands of a cruel, barbarous, and inſulting Enemy: Our Long-Boat, when finiſhed, can be fit for no Enter prize, but the Preſervation of Life: As we cannot act offenſively, we ought to have regard to our Safety and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty. This Evening Propoſals were offered to the Officers concerning our going through the <hi>Streights</hi> of <hi>Magellan;</hi> which at this Time they ſeem to approve of.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> the 31ſt, hard Gales at N. W. with rain: This Day was taken up along Shore an Otter juſt killed, but by what Ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal we could not tell; it was bleeding freſh when taken up, and proved a dainty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſt.

            <p>
               <hi>Saturday, Auguſt</hi> the 1ſt, hard Gales at N. W. with rain and Hail. This Day put to an Allowance of Flour, one Quarter of a Pound a Man <hi>per Diem,</hi> and one Pint of Wine; thoſe who like Brandy, to have half a Pint in Lieu of Wine. We have now in a manner nothing to live on but what we pick up along the Shore: The Ship's Company agree to go through the <hi>Streights</hi> of <hi>Magellan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday</hi> the 2d, This Morning found the Store Tent robbed of Brandy; filled up all the ullago Caſks; picked up about the rocks Abundance of Clams, a Shell-fiſh not unlike our Cockles: Theſe Fiſh are at preſent the Support of our Life. The People are now very quarrelſome and diſcontented.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> the 3d, this Day having fine Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which is a Prodigy in the Place) launched the Boat, and went about the rocks and Iſlands on Diſcovery. This Day we alſo moved into our new Houſe, it being a very commodious Habitation, exceeding well thatched; in this Dwelling there are Cabbins for fourteen People, which are covered inſide and out with broad Cloath: This is a rich Houſe, and, in ſome Parts of the World,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:007859_0079_102DDADCB7646F68"/>would purchaſe a pretty Eſtate; there are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hundred Yards of Cloth about it, beſides the Curtains and Linings, which are Shalloon and Camblet; in ſhort, conſidering where we are, we cannot deſire a better Habitation. The People fall into Diſputes concerning the Boat, where we are to proceed with her, when ſhe is built and ready for going off. It is the Opinion of the Navigators, that going through the <hi>Streights</hi> of <hi>Magellan</hi> is the ſafeſt and only Way to preſerve Life and Liberty: The Artiſts, who have worked the Bearings and Diſtance, are very preſſing that it ſhould be moved to the Captain, purpoſing to have their reaſons drawn up, and ſigned by all who are willing to go that Way, and to be delivered to the Captain for his Opinion: upon this there was a Paper drawn up, and as ſoon as the People heard it, they came flocking to ſign firſt, crying all aloud for the <hi>Streights,</hi> ſeeming overjoyed, as if they were going to <hi>England</hi> directly, without any Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction or Trouble, but there muſt be a great deal of Hardſhip to be encountered before we arrive at our native Country: This Paper was ſigned by all the Officers on the Spot, except the Captain, Lieutenant, Purſer, and Surgeon, and by all the Seamen in general, except the Captain's Steward.</p>

               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 5th, this Day I went with the Maſter, Carpenter, Maſter's Mate, and Midſhipmen, to the Captain, to acquaint him with what was done, and reſolv'd on; and farther told him, It was a Duty incumbent on us to preſerve Life before any other Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt. He anſwer'd, Gentlemen, I deſire Time to conſider of it, and will give you my final Determination; on which we took our Leave, and came away.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 6th, hard Gales at W. S. W. and rainy Weather. At Noon went with Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> to Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi>'s Tent, to have ſome farther Conference for our future Deliverance. While we were there, the Captain ſent his Service to Capt. <hi>Cheap</hi> for a Pair of Pocket-Piſtols, his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, which had been refuſed him on his requeſt ſome Time before. The Servant
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:007859_0083_102DDAE4AA122FF8"/>was anſwer'd by the Captain's Favourite, and Prime Miniſter, the Steward, The Captain is ill, and I can't let you have 'em. This anſwer not being ſatisfactory to Capt. <hi>Pemberton,</hi> he ſent a ſecond Time, and inſiſted on the Delivery of his Piſtols; but was anſwer'd, they could not be come at before the Captain was up; but a little Time after it was judg'd proper to ſend Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi> his Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tols. From Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi>'s we went to the Lieutenant's Tent; while there, the Lieutenant was ſent for to Captain <hi>Cheap;</hi> about an Hour after the Carpenter and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf were ſent for; when we came to him, he ſaid, Gentlemen, I have maturely conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd the Contents of your Paper, ſo far as it regards the Preſervation of the People on the Spot: This Paper has given me a great deal of Uneaſineſs, inſomuch that I have not clos'd my Eyes till Eight o'Clock this Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for thinking of it; but, I think, you have not weigh'd the Thing rightly; do you know we are above one hundred and ſixty Leagues diſtant S. W. from the <hi>Sreights</hi> of <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gellan,</hi> with the Wind againſt us? Then think on the Diſtance to be run afterwards on the other Side the <hi>Streights,</hi> with the Wind always againſt us, and where no Water is to be
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:007859_0084_102DDAE7474E2DA0"/>had. I anſwer'd, Sir, you ſay it is above one hundred and ſixty Leagues to the <hi>Streights;</hi> but let the Navigators work it, and they will find it not above ninety Leagues; yourſelf and Lieutenant are undoubtedly Navigators and Judges, therefore will certainly find it as I ſay. Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> acquainted him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Calculation, the Veſſel would carry a Month's Water at a Quart a Man <hi>per Diem;</hi> and, Sir, do you conſider, after running a-long Shore to the Northward this Side the Land, that we have one hundred Leagues to run right out to Sea to the Iſland of <hi>Juan Ferdinandez;</hi> and five hundred Chances to one, if we meet the Commodore there, or any of the Squadron; nor do we know but the Commodore may have ſhared the ſame Fate with ourſelves, or perhaps worſe? The Captain anſwer'd, It's a thouſand to one if we ſee the Commodore at <hi>Juan Ferdinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dez;</hi> for, Gentlemen, to let you into a Secret which I never diſcover'd before, we ſhall meet him at <hi>Baldavia,</hi> his Orders were from—to go there with the Squadron, it being a Place of little or no Force. Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> anſwer'd, Sir, 'tis agreed, the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore is at <hi>Baldavia;</hi> but we make it in our Bargain, when we go from hence, that we

                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> put aſhore at every Place when we want Water, whenever the Weather will permit, without any Obſtruction. The Captain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, There is no Occaſion for that; we will water at the Iſlands, and take a Veſſel going along. Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> ſaid, Sir, what ſhall we do with a Veſſel, without Proviſions, for ninety Souls? The Captain anſwer'd, We will take a Veſſel loaden with Flour from <hi>Chili,</hi> there being a great many Trading Veſſels that Way; and then we will proceed through the <hi>Streights of Magellan.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins</hi> ſaid, How ſhall we take a Veſſel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Guns not having any but Muſkets, and our Enemies know as well as ourſelves, that we have a Squadron in theſe Seas, therefore undoubtedly are well arm'd, and keep a good Look-out. The Captain's Anſwer to this was, What are our ſmall Arms for, but t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> board 'em? The Carpenter ſaid, Sir, if a Shot ſhould take the Beat under Water, it would not be in my Power to ſtop a Leak of that kind, where the Plank is ſo thin, that in ſome Places it is not above three Quarters of an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ch thick. The Captain then ſaid, Gentlemen, I am agreeable to any Thing, and willing to go any Way, for the Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the People; but at the ſame Time
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:007859_0086_102DDAEB445A7C98"/>would have you conſider of it, the Wind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing always againſt us on the other Side the Land, and we have above ſeven hundred Leagues to the river <hi>Plate.</hi> I anſwer'd the Captain, 'Tis not above five hundred and nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Leagues from hence to Cape <hi>St. Antonio</hi>'s; and, as I have before ſaid, let the Navigators work it, and reaſon take Place, which is what we chiefly deſire to be govern'd by: Another Inducement we have to go the Way propos'd is, that we may be aſſur'd of Water and Proviſion. I allow that, ſays the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and we may ſave our own; but how do you know whether we may not meet Enemies in the <hi>Streights?</hi> I reply'd to the Captain, We can have no Enemies to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter there but <hi>Indians</hi> in their Canoes, and thoſe we can maſter at our Pleaſure. The Captain then ſeem'd to countenance our Opinion again, and ſaid, When we come to <hi>St. Julian</hi>'s we ſhall be ſure of Salt in Plenty for our Proviſions, without which our Fowls will not keep above two or three Days: Beſides, when we come to the river <hi>Plate,</hi> we may meet with a Prize, they not being acquainted with any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Veſſel like ours, with Schooner Sails; by which Means we may run up the river, and take a larger
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:007859_0087_102DDAED8C6E8690"/>Veſſel: If we fail here, we may go aſhore, and get what Cattle we pleaſe; but what Buſineſs have we at the <hi>Rio Grand?</hi> We muſt go to the <hi>Rio Janeiro.</hi> I told him, we ſhould be oblig'd to ſtop at every Place a-long Shore for Supplies; at <hi>St. Catharine</hi>'s the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor will give us a Certificate, ſo that we ſhall be known to be the People that were there in the Squadron. The Captain ſaid, That's true, and I can get Bills of Credit in any Part of <hi>Brazil;</hi> beſides, the People may be ſeparated, ſome in the <hi>Flota,</hi> and ſome in other Ships; with leſs Hands we may go to <hi>Barbados.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> told him, We might venture to <hi>England</hi> with twelve Hands. Yes, you may, ſays the Captain, with thirty. It is to be obſerv'd, during all this Debate, the Lieutenant ſpoke not a Word. The Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter aſking him the reaſon of his Silence i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> all the Conſulation he; anſwer'd, I'll give my Opinion hereafter. The Captain ſaid, I knew nothing of his being acquainted with it, till Mr. <hi>Bulkeley</hi> told me Yeſterday; but at the ſame Time, Mr. <hi>Beans,</hi> I expect you will be the firſt that will ſign the Paper. I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd the Captain meant our Paper, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately anſwer'd with ſome Warmth, As he had refus'd ſigning at firſt, and at the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:007859_0088_102DDAEF6F5CD508"/>ſame Time agreed to the Propoſal, that I had ſign'd ſo cloſe, that there was no room left for his Name, and now it was too late for him to ſign. The Captain ſurpriz'd me, by ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I don't mean your Paper. I told him, Any other, which ſhould be contrary to ours, would never be ſign'd by us. Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> ſaid to the Captain, Sir, 'tis all owing to you that we are here; if you had conſulted your Officers, we might have avoided this Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; conſidering the Condition the Ship was in, ſhe was not fit to come in with the Land, all our Men being ſick, and not above three Seamen in a Watch; ſuppoſe the Maſt had gone by the Board, as was every Moment expected. The Captain made Anſwer, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, you do not know my Orders, there never were any ſo ſtrict given to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander before; and had I but two Men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving beſides myſelf, I muſt, and was obliged to go to the firſt rendezvous, which was the Iſland of <hi>Noſtra Senhora di Socora:</hi> I was obliged to go there at all Events. I made Anſwer to this, Sir, if that is the Caſe, it ſeems plain, the Thing was deſign'd we ſhould be here; But, Sir, I am of Opinion, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the Commodore had his Orders from —to go with the Squadron to <hi>Baldavia,</hi>
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:007859_0089_102DDAF157F938E8"/>that at the ſame Time thoſe Orders were ſo far diſcretional, that if the Squadron was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, Care was to be taken not to endanger his Majeſty's Ships. Yes, that (ſays the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) was ſettled at <hi>St. Julian</hi>'s: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what has been ſaid, Gentlemen, I am agreeable to take any Chance with you, and to go any Way; but would have you conſider of it, and defer your Determination till all is ready to go off the Spot. I then told the Captain, You have known, Sir, from the Time you ſaw the Propoſal, that the People are uneaſy, and the Work is at a Stand, and in this Situation Things will be until this Affair is ſettled; therefore the ſooner you reſolve, the better. The Captain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, I deſign to have a Conſultation among my Officers: Have you any more Objections to make? I anſwer'd, Yes, Sir, one more; which is, When you go from hence, you are not to weigh, come to an Anchor, or alter Courſe, without conſulting your Officers. The Captain ſaid, Gentlemen, I was your Commander till the Ship parted, or as long as any Stores or Proviſions were getting out of her. We told him, we had always taken Care to obey his Orders in the ſtricteſt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; which he allow'd us to have done; and
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:007859_0090_102DDAF43627E828"/>he added, You were the Officers that I placed my whole Dependence in. We anſwer'd, Sir, we will ſupport you with our Lives, at long as you ſuffer reaſon to rule; and then we parted. After this Conſultation the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſeldom came out of his Tent, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd great Diſturbances among the People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> the 7th, the Wind at W. N. W. with rain. This Day the Navigators work'd the Bearings and Diſtance along Shore, from one Place to another, to know the true Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: Hereupon it was agreed to proceed through the <hi>Streights of Magellan,</hi> according to Sir <hi>John Narborough</hi>'s Directions, which give us great Encouragement to go that Way. Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi> draw'd his Men up, and diſmiſs'd 'em again. Great Uneaſineſs among the People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> the 8th, this Morning went to the Lieutenant, for him to acquaint the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all his Officers were ready to give ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſons for going through the <hi>Streights of Magellan,</hi> deſiring a Conſultation might be held in the Afternoon. At Three o'Clock the Captain ſent for me and Mr. <hi>Cummins;</hi> when we came, the Maſter and Bortſwain were ſent for, but they were gone in Search of Subſiſtence, as Limpets, Muſcles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:007859_0091_102DDAF5D2FB2950"/>The Captain ſaid, Gentlemen, I don't doubt but you have conſider'd upon the Buſineſs you are come about; therefore I am determin'd to take my Fate, with you, or where the Spirit of the People leads, and ſhall uſe my beſt Endeavours for their Preſervation; but I am afraid of meeting contrary Winds, for after the Sun has croſs'd the Line we muſt expect to meet 'em. I made Anſwer, By all Accounts, the Wind hangs from N. W. to the S. W. above three Parts of the Year; which is in our Favour. Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> told him, There was freſh Water to be got as well on one Coaſt as the other; and if Sir <hi>John Narborough</hi>'s Treatment was ſo ill in a profound Peace, what muſt we expect in a Time of open War? The Captain ſaid, I am afraid very bad. Then Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> ſpoke in this Manner to the Captain: Sir, I always took you for an honourable Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and I believe you to be ſuch; on your Honour, Sir, I beg you will give the true Sentiments of your Mind, whether thro' the <hi>Streights</hi> is not the ſureſt and ſafeſt Way to preſerve our Lives, notwithſtanding we have a Thouſand Difficulties to encounter with any Way? The Captain anſwer'd, I really think going to the Northward is the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:007859_0092_102DDAF76A118418"/>ſafeſt Way; for ſuppoſe we ſhould be drove off to Sea, when on the other Side the Land, what is to be done then? I ſaid, Sir, it is our Buſineſs to keep the Shore, to prevent all Accidents that may happen that Way. Then Lieutenant <hi>Beans</hi> made an Objection, Suppoſe you have the Wind blowing right in, and a tumbling Sea, ſo as to endanger the Boat, what are we to do? I made Anſwer, Sir, If you remember, when we were riding at <hi>St. Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s, it blow'd a very hard Gale of Wind right in from the Sea, yet, even then, the Sea did not run ſo high as to endanger a Boat riding at Anchor: Another Inſtance I bring you from <hi>St. Catherine</hi>'s, when we had ſuch hard Gales, that the <hi>Tryal</hi> loſt her Maſts, and the <hi>Pearl</hi> ſeparated from the Squadron; yet, at that Time, there was no Sea compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to what we have met with this Side the Land. The Lieutenant allow'd this to be Fact. Then the Captain ſaid, I will allow you to have Water at <hi>Port Deſire;</hi> but do you conſider the lengthening your Diſtance, by keeping along Shore, and rounding every Bay, and ſome of thoſe Bays are very deep. I told him, That undoubtedly there was Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all along the Coaſt, and that we had no Buſineſs to round the Bays, but to ſteer from
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:007859_0093_102DC6F66F8CD618"/>one Head-land to the other. Then Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>Beans</hi> made a ſecond Objection, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe we are forced into a Bay, and Shoal-Water? I anſwer'd, We ſhould always have a Boat a-head, and our Draught of Water will not be above four or five Feet at moſt; and if we ſhould be ſo unfortunate as to loſe our Boat, we muſt keep the Lead a going. The Lieutenant reply'd, That was true, and there could not be a great deal of Difficulty in it. This was the only Time the Lieutenant ever ſpoke in Publick on the Affair; he always allow'd, when abſent from the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that going through the <hi>Streights</hi> was the beſt Way; but in the Captain's Preſence he ſided with him, and was for going to the Northward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday</hi> the 9th, at Three this Afternoon, I went with Mr. <hi>Cummins,</hi> the Maſter, and Boatſwain, as deſir'd, to the Captain, to give him our Opinions, believing, going thro' the <hi>Streights</hi> the ſureſt Way to preſerve Life: It was therefore agreed, That if the Wind did not ſet in againſt us, at the Sun's Croſſing the Line, that the Captain would go that Way. The Captain ask'd every Man's Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and found the People unanimous for the <hi>Streights of Magellan.</hi> To-day, being
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:007859_0094_102DDAFB9CBB5CA8"/>fair Weather, launch'd the Yawl to go a Fowling; ſhot ſeveral Geeſe, Ducks, Shaggs, and Sea-pies. Heel'd the Long-Boat for planking.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> the 10th, Wind at N. and N.N.W. rainy Weather. Eat Slaugh and Sea-weed fry'd with Tallow-Candles, which we pick'd up along Shore; this we reckon at preſent exceeding good Eating, having nothing to live on but a Quarter of a Pound of Flour a Man <hi>per</hi> Day, and what we can get off the rocks; for many Days the Weather has been ſo bad, that we have not been able to ſtir abroad, though almoſt ſtarv'd for want of Food.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 11th, hard Gales at S. W. with heavy rains. This Afternoon the People came in Arms to acquaint us of the Stores being robbed; they therefore wanted our Conſent for moving the Stores to our Tent; on which we deſir'd they would deſiſt from offering any Violence; we told 'em of the ill Conſequence of Mutiny, which, as we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abhorr'd, we took all imaginable Care to prevent: The People, on our Perſuaſions, inſtantly quitted their Arms. The Captain preſently ſent for me and Mr. <hi>Cummins,</hi> to acquaint us with what had happen'd: He
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:007859_0095_102DDAFDDE34C5D8"/>told us, the Purſer accidentally coming by, ſaw the Priſoner, <hi>Rowland Cruſſet,</hi> a Marine, crawling from the Buſhes, and from under the Store-Tent, and found on him upwards of a Day's Flour for Ninety Souls, with one Piece of Beef under his Coat, and three Pieces more, which were conceal'd in the Buſhes, to carry off when an Opportunity offer'd; and the Centry, <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> his Meſs-mate, a Marine, undoubtedly was privy to the robbery. The Captain farther ſaid, We have nothing to do with them; but I ſhall ſend to Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi> to inſiſt on a Court-Martial: I really think, that for rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Store-Tent (which, in our preſent Circumſtances, is ſtarving the whole Body of People) the Priſoners deſerve Death. This was not only the Captain's Opinion, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Sentiments of every Perſon preſent. After we parted from the Captain, we were ſent for by Capt. <hi>Pemberton:</hi> He acquainted us, he would go as far as the Martial Law would allow him, and in Conjunction with the Sea-Officers: I look (ſaid he) on the Lieutenant as nothing, and the Captain in the ſame Light: As for you two (meaning the Gunner and Carpenter) I confide in, and ſhall have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to your Opinions. When the Articles
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:007859_0096_102DDB0088C21890"/>of War were read, we found their Crime did not touch Life, but that they were to ſuffer Corporal Puniſhment. Whilſt Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> was laying open the Nature of their Guilt, and the ill Conſequence of Lenity in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances we were in, I propos'd a Way, next to Death; which was, if judg'd proper by Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi> and Captain <hi>Cheap,</hi> to carry them off to an Iſland where the Ship parted, there being Muſcles, Limpets, and Clams in Abundance, and no want of Water, and there to be left till we ſhould be ready for ſailing; and, to ſtrike a Terror in all for the future, that if any Man ſhould be guilty of the like Offence, without any reſpect of Perſon, he ſhould ſhare the ſame Fate. This Propoſal was approved of by both the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. At Night Lieutenant <hi>Beans</hi> ſurpriz'd us with a new kind of Propoſal we little dreamt of, which was, to have a proper Place of Devotion to perform Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in every Sabbath-Day: For this Sacred Office our Tent was judg'd the moſt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Place. The Duty of publick Prayer had been entirely neglected on board, though every Seaman pays Four-pence per Month towards the Support of a Miniſter; yet De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, in ſo ſolemn a Manner, is ſo rarely
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:007859_0097_102DDB0276818978"/>perform'd that I know but one Inſtance of it during the many Years I have belong'd to the Navy. We believe religion to have the leaſt Share in this Propoſal of the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. If our Tent ſhould be turn'd into a a Houſe of Prayer, and this Project takes, we may, perhaps, in the Midſt of our Devotion, be ſurpriz'd, and our Arms taken from us, in order to fruſtrate our Deſigns, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our return to <hi>England</hi> through the <hi>Streights of Magellan,</hi> or any other Way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 12th, hard Gales from S.W. to W. with heavy Showers of Hail and rain. Serv'd out Proviſions To-day, a Piece of Beef for four Men; ſome Time paſt we have had but a Quarter of a Pound of Flour per Man per Day, and three Pieces of Beef; we live chiefly on Muſſles, Limpits, and Clams, with Saragraza and Thromba; one is a green broad Weed, common on the rocks in <hi>England;</hi> the other is a round Sea-Weed, ſo large, that a Man can ſcarce graſp it; it grows in the Sea, with broad Leaves; this laſt we boil, the Saragraza we fry in Tallow; in this Manner we ſupport Life: Even thoſe Shell-Fiſh and Weeds we get with great Difficulty; for the Wind, the rain, and Coldneſs of the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate in this Seaſon, are ſo extremely ſevere,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:007859_0098_102DDB04703998A8"/>that a Man will pauſe ſome Time whether he ſhall ſtay in his Tent and ſtarve, or go out in Queſt of Food.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> the 14th, very hard Gales at W. and N. W. with Showers of rain and Hail, which beat with ſuch Violence againſt a Man's Face, that he can hardly withſtand it; however, one of our Meſs-mates To-day ſhot three Gulls and a Hawk; which gave us a very elegant repaſt. This Day was held a Court-Martial on the Centry who was believ'd confederated with the Marine that robbed the Store-Tent: Sentence was paſs'd on 'em to receive ſix hundred Laſhes each: Captain <hi>Cheap,</hi> not thinking the Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adequate to the Crime, cut 'em ſhort of their Allowance; ſo that they have now but half the Proviſions they had before: The Day following the Offenders receiv'd Two Hundred Laſhes each, as Part of their Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We hawl'd the Long-Boat higher up, for fear the Sea ſhould waſh the Blocks from under her. We have found out a new Way of managing the Slaugh; we fry it in thin Batter with Tallow, and uſe it as Bread.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday</hi> the 16th, Freſh Gales of Wind at S. W. with heavy Showers of Hail: The People generally complain of a Malady in
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:007859_0099_102DDB0664727D78"/>their Eyes; they are in great Pain, and can ſcarce ſee to walk about. The laſt Tide flowed nine Feet perpendicular; To-day we picked up Shell-Fiſh in Abundance, with Pieces of Beef and Pork. The Priſoners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived two Hundred Laſhes more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 18th, this Day the Carpenter, who has all along been indefatigable in working about the Long-Boat, ſaw one of the Seamen cutting up an Anchor Stock for Fire-Wood, which had been deſigned for a particular Uſe for the Boat; at Sight of the Fellow's Folly be could not contain himſelf: This Affair, added to the little Concern and intollerable Indifference that appeared in the Generality of the People, for ſome Time impaired his Underſtanding, and made him delirious; all poſſible Methods are uſed to reſtore him, as he is the only Man, who, through the Aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Providence, can compleat the Means of our Deliverance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 19th, The Carpenter was ſo much recovered, that he went to work as uſual; at Night, the Lieutenant acquainted us, that the Captain deſired to ſpeak with the Carpenter and me To-morrow at Noon, to conſult what ſhould be done with the Two Priſoners, having received but Four Hundrrd
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:007859_0100_102DDBB8A524AAC0"/>Laſhes out of the Six, to which they were ſentenced by a Court-Martial, the other Two Hundred being remitted by their own Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 20th, We waited on the Captain, who acquainted us with what the Lieutenant had mentioned laſt Night relating to the Priſoners: We told him the People were very uneaſy about this Mitigation of the Puniſhment inflicted on them by a Court Martial; therefore it was agreed they ſhould provide for themſelves as well as they could; but to have no Sort of Proviſions out of the Store-Tent for the future.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22d, we begun upon ſeveral Contrivances to get Proviſions, ſuch as build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Punts, Caſk-Boats, Leather-Boats, and the like.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> the 23d, The Store-Tent was again robbed, and, on Examination, was found a Deficiency of Twelve Days Brandy for Ninety Men: The Lieutenant, myſelf, and Carpenter went to the Captain to conſult ſome Way which might effectually prevent thoſe villainous Practices for the future; the Captain deſired us to make a nice Enquiry into this robbery, being determined to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the ſevereſt Puniſhment on the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:007859_0101_102DDB08AA01EBE8"/>tho' it would give him the greateſt Concern if any innocent Perſon ſhould ſuffer. This Day we confined one of the Centinels for being drunk on his Poſt; the Day follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Boatſwain gave us Information of the Perſons who had robbed the Tent; they were two Centinels, <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Butler;</hi> thoſe very Perſons were the firſt who inſiſted, that the Seamen, as well as themſelves, ſhould watch the Store-Tent; their own Officers, as ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, have brought them to no Examination: We have alſo Information that the Purſer holds frequent Converſation with the rebels, contrary to all the Laws of the Navy, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying them with Liquors in Abundance, to the great Diſtreſs of his Majeſty's faithful Subjects, who have but Half a Pint per Day to ſubſiſt on. There are now great Diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances among the People concerning going to the Northward; they believe Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> never intended to return to <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> by his propoſing this Way, in Oppoſition to the Opinion of all the Navigators, who have given reaſons for going thro' the <hi>Streights of Magellan.</hi> There is a Sort of Party-rage among the People, fomented by a kind of Bribery that has more Influence on the Seamen than Money; there are ſome daily
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:007859_0102_102DDB0B90948D78"/>bought off by rum and other ſtrong Liquors. Unleſs a Stop is put to theſe Proceedings, we ſhall never go off the Spot.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 25th, This Day felt Four great Earthquakes, three of which were very ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible; notwithſtanding theſe violent Shocks and Tremblings of the Earth, we find no Ground ſhifted. Hard Gales of Wind at the North, with heavy Showers of rain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 27th, The Diſturbances in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe among the People; we plainly ſee there is a Party raiſed to go to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; we went to the Lieutenant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted with him what was to be done in the preſent Exigence; myſelf being reckoned the Projector of the Scheme for going through the <hi>Streights</hi> was threatened to be ſhot by <hi>Noble</hi> the Quarter-Maſter; After having ſome Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with the Lieutenant, he told me, If I would draw up a Paper for the Captain to ſign, in order to ſatisfy the People, that he would go the Southward, and every Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer to have a Copy of it to juſtify himſelf in <hi>England,</hi> it would be as proper a Method as we could take. The Paper was immediately drawn up in theſe Words, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="unknown:007859_0103_102DDB0DE1FCED80"/>
WHEREAS upon a General Conſul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, it has been agreed to go from this Place through the <hi>Streights of Magellan,</hi> for the Coaſt of <hi>Brazil,</hi> in our Way for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> We do, notwithſtanding, find the People ſeparating into Parties, which muſt conſequently end in the Deſtruction of the whole Body; and as alſo there have been great robberies committed on the Stores, and every Thing is now at a Stand; therefore, to prevent all future Frauds and Animoſities, we are unanimouſly agreed to proceed as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned.</p>
            <p>This Paper was delivered to the Lieutenant, who ſaid that he was ſure the Captain would ſign it; but in caſe of refuſal, he ſhould be confin'd for ſhooting Mr. <hi>Cozens,</hi> and he would take the Command on himſelf: And, to prevent further Diſturbances, the Purſer, as he much converſed with the rebels, it is agreed by the Body of Officers, to ſend him off the Iſland, for acting ſo contrary to his Duty, in Contempt of the Articles of War, the Laws of his Country, and the known rules of the Navy. It was likewiſe agreed, that any Perſon who engaged himſelf in
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:007859_0104_102DDB0FD9F4AB28"/>raiſing Parties, ſhould be diſarm'd. By this Day's Proceedings, we thought the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant a Gentleman of reſolution; but the Words and Actions of People do not always concur.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> the 28th, To-day the Officers and People all appear'd in Arms. The Maſter, Boatſwain, Gunner, and Carpenter, with Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> Mate, and Mr. <hi>Cambell,</hi> Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipman, went into the Captain's Tent, the Lieutenant being with him. As ſoon as the Officers were ſeated, a Conſultation was held concerning <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Butler</hi>'s robbing the Store-Tent; they were ſentenced to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſported to the Main, or ſome Iſland. As ſoon as this Affair was over, we talk'd to the Captain of the Uneaſineſs among the People; that there had been a long Time a viſible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude among 'em, and that we could not help ſeeing there were Schemes form'd to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct our Deſign in going to the Southward. The Captain anſwer'd, Gentlemen, it is Time enough to think of this when we are ready to go off: Have not I told you before, that I do not care which Way I go, Southward or Northward? I will take my Fate with you. Every Body now expected the Lieutenant to reply, eſpecially after the Zeal he expreſs'd
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:007859_0105_102DDB121C0FC6E0"/>himſelf with the Day before; but he ſat ſpeechleſs, without any regard to the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the People, or to his own Propoſals. Finding he did not move in the Affair, I took out the Paper which was agreed to by the Lieutenant and the reſt of the Officers, and read it to the Captain, and ask'd him to ſign it; which he ſtrenuouſly oppos'd and ſeem'd very much enrag'd that it ſhould be propos'd to him. Upon this we dropt the Matter, and began to diſcourſe concerning the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions: We thought it neceſſary, that ten Weeks Subſiſtence ſhould be ſecur'd to carry with us, and that the Liquor ſhould be buried under Ground; but he gave us no Anſwer. Finding no relief here, we went to Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi>'s Tent, to conſult with him what we ſhould do in the preſent Exigence. On our coming out from the Captain, we ſaw a Flag hoiſted on Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi>'s Tent, the Captain himſelf ſeated in a Chair, ſurrounded by the People. On ſeeing this, all the Officers preſent at the Conſultation, except the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, went over to Captain <hi>Pemberton.</hi> Here it was agreed, in Caſe the Captain perſiſted to refuſe ſigning the Paper, to take the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from him, and to give it the Lieutenant, according to the Lieutenant's own Propoſal.
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:007859_0106_102DDB13B5DAE938"/>At the ſame Time Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi> told the People, he would ſtand by 'em with his Life, in going through the <hi>Streights of Magellan,</hi> the Way propos'd in the Paper. The People gave three Cheers, crying aloud for <hi>England.</hi> The Captain hearing the Noiſe, got out of Bed to his Tent Door, and call'd the People, enquiring what they wanted; then ſent for all the Officers: He was then told, ſince he refus'd ſigning the Paper, and had no regard to the Safety of our Proviſions, the People unanimouſly agreed to take the Command from him, and transfer it to the Lieutenant. Hearing this, with an exalted Voice, Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> ſays, Who is he that will take the Command from me? Addreſſing himſelf to the Lieutenant, Is it you, Sir? The Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant reply'd, No, Sir. The Terror of the Captain's Aſpect intimidated the Lieutenant to that Degree, that he look'd like a Ghoſt. We left him with the Captain, and return'd to Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi>'s Tent, to acquaint him of the Lieutenant's refuſing the Command. We had not been long here before Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> ſent for us. I was the firſt Perſon call'd for; at my entering his Tent, I ſaw him ſeated on a Cheſt, with a cock'd Piſtol on his right Thigh; obſerving this, I deſir'd
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:007859_0107_102DDB15F7E02F18"/>Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> who was the Mate he always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd on for Navigation, to tell the Captain I did not think proper to come before a cock'd Piſtol: Notwithſtanding I was arm'd, I drew back, altho' I had my Piſtol cock'd, and there were ſeveral Men near me arm'd with Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets. The Captain's perſonal Bravery no Man doubted of; his Courage was exceſſive, and made him raſh and deſperate; his ſhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> was a fatal Proof of it; he was grown more deſperate by this unhappy Action, and was obſerv'd ſince ſeldom to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have himſelf with any Compoſure of Mind. It is a Piece of human Prudence to retreat from a Man in a Phrenzy, becauſe he who does not value his own Life, has another Man's in his Power. I had no Deſire of fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Hand of Captain <hi>Cheap,</hi> and ſhould be greatly diſturb'd to be compell'd, for my own Preſervation, to diſcharge a Piſtol at a Gentleman againſt whom I never had any Spleen, and who was my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. When Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> acquainted him with what I deſired him, the Captain threw his Piſtol aſide, and came out of his Tent; he told the People, he would go with them to the Southward; he deſired to know their Grievances, and he would redreſs them: They
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:007859_0108_102DDB183B1ADFE8"/>all call'd out for their Sea-Store of Proviſions to be ſecur'd, and the reſt equally divided. Here the Captain ſhow'd all the Conduct and Courage imaginable; he was a ſingle Man againſt a Multitude, all of 'em diſſatisfy'd with him, and all of 'em in Arms: He told 'em the ill Conſequence of ſharing the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, that it was living To-day and ſtarving To-morrow; but the People were not to be ſatisfy'd, the Officers had now no Authority over 'em, and they were ſome Time deaf to their Perſuaſions; nay, it was with Difficulty that they could diſſuade 'em from pulling down the Store-Tent, and taking away the Proviſions by Force; they remov'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions out of the Store-Tent, then fell to digging a Hole to bury the Brandy; the Sea-Store to be ſecur'd, the remainder to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſhar'd. Had this been comply'd with, the Conſequences might have been very terrible: However, to pacify 'em in ſome Shape, it was agreed, that every Man ſhould have a Pint of Brandy <hi>per</hi> Day, which, by Calculation, would laſt 'em three Weeks. On this they ſeem'd very eaſy, and went to their reſpective Tents. The Captain told his Officers, that he would act nothing contrary to what was agreed on for the Welfare and
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:007859_0109_102DDB19DE90A560"/>Safety of the Community. Finding the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in a Temper of Mind to hearken to reaſon, I ſaid to him, Sir, I think it my Duty to inform you, that I am not the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon whom you imagine to be the Principal in this Affair. The Captain anſwer'd, How can I think otherwiſe? I reply'd, Sir, the Paper I read to you was your Lieutenant's Projec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: There ſits the Gentleman, let him diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own it, if he can. The Captain turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to the Lieutenant, ſays, Mr. <hi>Bulkeley</hi> has honeſtly clear'd himſelf. We then drank a Glaſs of Wine, and took our Leaves. At Night the Captain ſent for Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> and me to ſup with him; we were the only Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers preſent with him: When I was ſeated, I ſaid, Sir, I have my Character at Stake, for drawing back from your cock'd Piſtol: Had I advanc'd, one of us muſt have dropt.</p>
            <p>Captain anſwer'd, <hi>Bulkeley,</hi> I do aſſure you, the Piſtol was not deſign'd for you, but for another; for I knew the Whole before. We then talk'd of indifferent Things, and ſpent the Evening in a very affable Manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> the 29th, came here five <hi>Indian</hi> Canoes, loaden with Muſſels; Men, Women and Children were about fifty: Theſe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> had never been with us before; they
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:007859_0110_102DDB1BE3455F88"/>are not ſo generous and good natur'd as our Friends I have already mention'd; they were ſo mercenary, that they would not part with a ſingle Muſſel without ſomething in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change; their Stay was but ſhort with us, for the next Morning they launch'd their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes and went off.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday, September</hi> the 1ſt, the Carpenter was ſhot in the Thigh with ſeveral large Pewter Sluggs by the Captain's Cook; but he being at a great Diſtance, the Sluggs did not enter his Skin: Whether this was deſign'd, or accidental, we don't know; however, we thought it proper to diſarm him.</p>

               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the ad, Wind at N. and N. by W. with rain. This Day we were inform'd that three of the Deſerters, <hi>viz. James Mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chel,</hi> Carpenter's Mate, <hi>Joſeph King,</hi> and <hi>Owen Thomſon,</hi> Seamen, were gone over to the Main in a Punt of their own building; the others were here Yeſterday, and I believe would be gladly receiv'd again, but am of Opinion there are few Voices in their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Friday</hi> the 4th, ſome Diſorders among the People about watching the Proviſions, ſome taking all Opportunities to rob the Stores. Our Living now is very hard; Shell-fiſh are
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:007859_0111_102DDB1E44FFCCE8"/>very ſcarce, and difficult to be had; the Sea-weeds are our greateſt Support; we have found a Sort of Sea-weed, which we call <hi>Dulſe;</hi> it is a narrow Weed, growing on rocks in the Sea, which, when boiled about Two Hours, thickens the Water like Flour; this we eſteem a good and wholeſom Food.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday</hi> the 6th, laſt Night the Store-Tent was robbed of Brandy and Flour: The People at hearing of this were greatly enraged, and inſiſt on ſearching the Marines Tents; on Search they found four Bottles of Brandy, and four ſmall Parcels of Flour. The Captain ſent for the Lieutenant, Maſter, Gunner, Carpenter, and Surgeon, with Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants <hi>Hamilton, Ewers,</hi> and <hi>Fielding,</hi> of the Army; Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi> was alſo ſent for, but was ſo ill that he could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, but deſir'd all might paſs according to the Judgment of the above-mentioned Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. A Conſultation was held: Five of the accus'd Marines did not appear, dreading the Puniſhment due to their Crime; they march'd off to the Deſerters: Four more, who ſtaid to be try'd, receiv'd Sentence, on the firſt Opportunity, to carry them off to the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>, and there to ſhift for themſelves with the former Deſerters. The Seamen inſiſted on a
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:007859_0112_102DDB20B631BBC8"/>Pint of Brandy each Man per Day, which was agreed on. The Proviſions being found, were put into the Store.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> the 7th, I was invited to a Dog-Feaſt at Mr. <hi>Jones</hi>'s Tent: There were preſent at this Entertainment, the Lieutenant, the Honourable <hi>John Byron,</hi> Mr. <hi>Cummins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Campbell,</hi> Mr. <hi>Young,</hi> Lieutenants <hi>Ewers</hi> and <hi>Fielding,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Oakley,</hi> of the Army. It was exceeding good Eating; we thought no <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mutton preferable to it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 8th, in the Afternoon, <hi>William Harvey,</hi> Quarter-Gunner, came to our Tent, with a Paper ſign'd by ſeven People; the Contents as follows, viz.</p>

            <p>The next Day, the above mention'd added one more to their Number, <hi>viz. Peter Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow,</hi> Captain's Steward: He came to acquaint us, he was willing to go with them, and hoped we would give our Conſent; we told him we had nothing to do with it, therefore he muſt apply to the Captain.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 10th, hard Gales at W. N. W. with rain and Hail. The Captain ſent for the Lieutenant, Maſter, myſelf, the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and Boatſwain: When we were all met, the Captain aſk'd us, if <hi>Plaſtow</hi> had men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd any Thing to us about going off in the Yawl. We told him he had. <hi>Plaſtow</hi> being ſent for, the Captain ſaid, <hi>Peter!</hi> I hear you are for going in the Boat. He anſwer'd, Yes, Sir; I will take my Chance, for I want to get to <hi>England.</hi> The Captain bade him be gone for a Villain, and ſaid no more. This <hi>Plaſtow</hi> was a mighty Favourite with the Captain, and had often been admitted to his Converſation: He above all Men ought to
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:007859_0114_102DDB24A409BD10"/>have ſtood ſtedfaſt to him, becauſe the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain regarded him above the whole Body of People, and hath been heard to ſay as much. It was this Day agreed, that the Sentence put off on the 6th ſhould be executed the firſt Opportunity, without any Delay; and that no Boat ſhould go off from hence before all was ready, believing ſome have a Deſign to go to the Northward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday,</hi> the 11th, Wind at N. N. W. The People very uneaſy: ſcarce any Work done for this Week paſt; every Thing is at a Stand; we have now among us no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, Order, or Diſcipline; add to our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs, the Uncomfortableneſs of the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate; we have been Inhabitants of this Iſland ſixteen Weeks, and have not ſeen ten fair Days; the Murmurings of the People, the Scarcity of Proviſion, and the Severity of the Weather, would really make a Man weary of Life.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> the 14th, laſt Night very hard Gales at N. and W. N. W. with large Showers of Hail, with Thunder. The Wind To-day is much abated. As to the Article of Proviſions, nothing comes amiſs; we eat Dogs, rats, and, in ſhort, every Thing we can come at.</p>

               <hi>Friday</hi> the 18th, <hi>Dennis O'Lary</hi> and <hi>John Redwood,</hi> Seamen, with ſix Marines, were put off to the Main, according to their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; it being a fine Summer's Day. This Day the Lieutenant, bringing a Pair of Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tols to the Carpenter, and complaining they were in bad Order, did not imagine they were loaded, ſnapping the firſt it miſs'd Fire, the ſecond went off, but providentially did no Harm, tho' the Lieutenant had then a Crowd of People about him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday</hi> the 20th, little Wind, and clear Weather. Launch'd the Barge, and went off to the Wreck; we took up four Caſks of Beef, with a Caſk of Peaſe, which was ſtav'd; we ſerv'd out to each Man five Pieces of Beef, and Peaſe to ſuch as would have 'em, but there were none to take 'em, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now Plenty of Meat, our Stomachs are become nice and dainty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 23d, the People went to the Captain with a Two Gallon Cagg, and aſk'd it full of Wine: The Captain refus'd 'em; but apprehending that they would make no Ceremony of filling it without Leave, and carrying it off by Force, he thought proper to order it to be fill'd: They brought it to the Long-Boat, and drank it in her Hold.
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:007859_0116_102DDB28DCBBA2F8"/>Stept the Long-Boat's Maſt forward. The People very much diſorder'd in Liquor, and very quarrelſome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 24th, I was ſent on a Week's Cruize in the Barge; the Officers with me were Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> the Mate, and the Hon. Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> Midſhipman, and Mr. <hi>Harvey</hi> the Purſer, who was a good Draughtſman; we went in order to diſcover the Coaſt to the Southward, for the Safety of the Long-Boat; we were inform'd on our return, that the People in our Abſence went to the Captain, and got two Gallons of Wine which they mixed with their half Pints of Brandy; they got all drunk and mad, but no great Miſchiefs enſued. Six <hi>Indian</hi> Canoes likewiſe came in our Abſence loaded with Men, Women and Children; they brought with them Clams out of the Shells ſtrung on Lines: The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Women dived for Muſſels, and brought them aſhore in abundance; the Men went to the freſh Water river, and caught ſeveral Fiſh like our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Mullets. The People bought Dogs of the <hi>Indians,</hi> which they kill'd, and eat, eſteeming the Fleſh very good Food: The next Day the <hi>Indians</hi> went out and caught a vaſt Quantity of Fiſh out of a Pond, where they ſent in their Dogs to hunt;
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:007859_0117_102DDB2AB478A9B8"/>the Dogs dived, and drove the Fiſh aſhore in great Numbers, to one Part of the Pond, as if they had been drawn in a Seyne: the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> ſold the Fiſh to the People. This Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of catching Fiſh is, I believe, unknown any where elſe, and was very ſurpriſing; and, what is alſo very ſtrange, after the <hi>Indians</hi> went away, we hauled the Seyne over the Pond, and could never get a Fiſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> the 28th, returned with the Barge; the firſt Evening we were out we had a good Harbour for the Barge, which we put into; the firſt Animal we ſaw was a fine large Bitch, big with Puppies; we killed her; we then roaſted one Side, and boiled the other, were exceeding well pleaſed with our Fare, ſupped heartily, and ſlept well: The next Morning we got up at Day-breaking, and proceeded on our Cruize, finding all along the Coaſt to be very dangerous; at Evening put into a Place of very good Shelter for the Barge: Here we found the <hi>Indians</hi> had been very lately, the Shore being covered with the Offals of Seal: In an Hour's Time we killed ten wild Fowl; we roaſted three Geeſe and two Ducks, the reſt we put into a Sea Pye, ſo that we fared moſt elegantly; got up at Day-light next Morning, but ſeeing the
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:007859_0118_102DDB2C5409BED8"/>Weather hazy and dirty, thought it not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to put out with the Barge, fearing we ſhould not get a Harbour before Night; we took a Walk five Miles in the Country croſs the Land to the Southward, but could not ſee any Shelter for the Boat, being then twelve Leagues from the Place we came from; ſo we returned back in the Evening, and got into a fine ſandy Bay; I think it as good a Harbour for Shipping as any I ever ſaw: Coming into this Bay, ſaw the Southmoſt Land, which we had ſeen before, bearing about S. S. W. right over an Inlet of Land, about two Miles. After landing, lived as we did laſt Night; in the Morning we walked over, where we found a deep Bay, it being eighteen Leagues deep, and twelve Leagues broad; here we had a very good Proſpect of the Coaſt; we found here the green Peaſe that Sir <hi>John Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> mentions in his Book.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> the 3d of <hi>October,</hi> after our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the Cruize, the Lieutenant, the Maſter, myſelf, the Boatſwain, and Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> the Mate, went to the Captain, to acquaint him how forward the Boat was, and to conſult ſome Meaſures to be obſerv'd on board the Boat, to prevent Mutiny; he deſir'd a Day or two to conſider of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:007859_0119_102DDB3001620CB8"/>
On <hi>Monday</hi> the 5th, the Carpenter ſent his Caſe Bottle, as uſual, to the Captain, to be filled with Wine; but it was ſent back empty, with this Anſwer, I will give him none: This ſudden Change of the Captain's Behaviour to the Carpenter, proceeded from ſome Words which the latter dropt, and were carried to the Captain; The Words the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter ſpoke were to this Purport, That he was not to be led by Favour or Affection, nor to be biaſſed by a Bottle of Brandy. To-day we heeled the Long-Boat, and caulked the Starboard Side, paid ber Bottom with Wax, Tallow, and Soap, that came out of the Ship.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 6th, hard Gales at N. W. and N. with rain: This Morning the Lieutenant acquainted us of the Captain's reſolution, which was to be Captain as before, and to be governed by the rules of the Navy, and to ſtand or fall by them; it was objected in the preſent Situation, the rules of the Navy are not ſufficient to direct us, ſeveral rules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing requiſite in our Circumſtances which are not mention'd there; that the whole Body of Officers and People are determin'd not to be govern'd by thoſe rules at preſent. This Objection was ſtarted, not from a Diſreſpect
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:007859_0120_102DDB31F0293558"/>to thoſe rules; but we imagin'd, if Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> was reſtor'd to the abſolute Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand he had before the Loſs of the <hi>Wager,</hi> that he would proceed again upon the ſame Principles, never on any Exigence conſult his Officers, but act arbitrarily, according to his Humour and Confidence of ſuperior Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: While he acts with reaſon, we will ſupport his Command with our Lives; but ſome reſtriction is neceſſary for our own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation. We think him a Gentleman worthy to have a limitted Command, but too dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a Perſon to be truſted with an abſolute one. This Afternoon the People inſiſted to be ſerv'd Brandy out of the Caſks that were buried Under-ground; accordingly they were ſerv'd half a Pint each Man. Got the Long-Boat upright.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 8th, this Day the Maſter went to the Captain concerning ten half Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of Powder more than can be carried off, which will make good Water-Caſks for the Boats: The Captain told him not to ſtart the Powder, or deſtroy any Thing without his Orders; and ſaid, he muſt have Time to conſider of it. In the Afternoon, Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi> of the Land Forces, came on the Beach, and deſired the Aſſiſtance of the
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:007859_0121_102DDB33983B4EE0"/>Seamen to take Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> a Priſoner, for the Death of Mr. <hi>Cozens,</hi> the Midſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; telling us, he ſhould be call'd to an Account, if he did not. This Evening the Carpenter went up to the Hill-Tent, ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from its Situation; the People were ſhooting Balls at Marks; ſome of 'em were firing in Vollies, without Shot or Sluggs: One of the Men on the Beach fir'd at the Tent while the Carpenter was in it, who was ſtanding with a Book in his Hand; there was a Piece of Beef hung cloſe at his Cheek, the Ball went through the Tent and the Beef, but the Carpenter receiv'd no Damage. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day I overhaul'd the Powder, and told the Lieutenant that I had twenty-three half Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels in Store, and that we could not carry off in the Veſſel above ſix half Barrels; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore purpoſe to ſtart the Overplus into the Sea, and make Water-Caſks of the half Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, they being very proper for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe. I deſired him to acquaint the Captain with my Intention; that ſince he had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for the Publick Good, or to any Thing that tending to promoting it, the Carpenter and I had determin'd never to go near him again. The Lieutenant declin'd going, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Captain would murder him; but he
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:007859_0122_102DDB35A4F2C938"/>ſent the Maſter to him, to let him know the Neceſſity of ſtarting the Powder: The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's Anſwer to the Maſter was, I deſire you will not deſtroy any one Thing without my Orders. We now are convinc'd the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hath no Intention of going to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, notwithſtanding he had lately given his Word and Honour that he would; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Captain <hi>Pemberton,</hi> in order to put an End to all future Obſtructions, demanded our Aſſiſtance to make him a Priſoner for the ſhooting Mr. <hi>Cozens,</hi> intending to carry him as ſuch to <hi>England;</hi> at the ſame Time to confine Lieutenant <hi>Hamilton</hi> with him: which was readily agreed to by the whole Body. It was reckon'd dangerous to ſuffer the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any longer to enjoy Liberty; therefore the Lieutenant, Gunner, Carpenter, and Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> the Mate, reſolv'd next Morning to ſurprize him in his Bed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> the 9th, this Morning went in a Body and ſurpriz'd the Captain in Bed, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd him, and took every Thing out of his Tent. The Captain ſaid to the Seamen, what are you about? Where are my Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers? At which the Maſter, Gunner, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, and Boatſwain, went in. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſaid, Gentlemen, do you know what
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:007859_0123_102DDB37E4CFFB10"/>you have done, or are about? He was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, Yes, Sir, our Aſſiſtance was demanded by Captain <hi>Pemberton,</hi> to ſecure you as a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoner for the Death of Mr. <hi>Cozens;</hi> and as we are Subjects of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> we are oblig'd to take you as ſuch to <hi>England.</hi> The Captain ſaid, Gentlemen, Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi> hath nothing to do with me; I am your Commander ſtill; I will ſhew you my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions; which he did to the People; on this we came out. He then call'd his Officers a ſecond Time, and ſaid, What is this for? He was anſwer'd, as before, That Aſſiſtance was demanded by Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi> to take him Priſoner for the Death of Mr. <hi>Cozens.</hi> He ſtill inſiſted, Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi> has no Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs with me; I could not think you would ſerve me ſo. It was told him, Sir, it is your own Fault: you have given yourſelf no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Concern, for the Publick Good, on our going from hence; but have acted quite the reverſe, or elſe been ſo careleſs and indifferent about it, as if we had no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; and if other Perſons had given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves no more Trouble and Concern than you have, we ſhould not be ready to go from hence as long as Proviſions laſted. The Captain ſaid, Very well, Gentlemen, you have
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:007859_0124_102DDB3A275D4158"/>caught me Napping; I do not ſee any of you in Liquor; you are a Parcel of brave Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, but my Officers are Scoundrels: Then turning himſelf to me, he ſaid, Gunner, where's my Lieutenant? Did not he Head You? I told him, No, Sir; but was here to ſee it executed, and is here now. One of you (ſays the Captain) call Mr. <hi>Beans.</hi> When Mr. <hi>Beans</hi> came, he ſaid, What is all this for, Sir? Sir, it is Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi>'s Order. Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi> hath no Buſineſs with me, and you will anſwer for it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; if I do not live to ſee <hi>England,</hi> I hope ſome of my Friends will. On this the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant left him. The Captain then addreſs'd himſelf to the Seamen, ſaying, My Lads, I do not blame you; but it is the Villany of my Officers, which they will anſwer for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. He then call'd Mr. <hi>Beans</hi> again, and ſaid, Well, Sir, what do you deſign to do by me? The Lieutenant anſwer'd, Sir, your Officers have deſign'd the Purſer's Tent for you. Hum! I ſhould be obliged to the Gentlemen, if they would let me ſtay in my own Tent. The Lieutenant came to acquaint the Officers of the Captain's requeſt; but they judg'd it inconvenient; as Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Tent join'd the Purſer's, one Guard might ſerve
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:007859_0125_102DDB3BC45413F8"/>'em both; accordingly all his Things were mov'd to the Purſer's Tent: As he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along, he ſaid, Gentlemen, you muſt excuſe my not pulling my Hat off, my Hands are confin'd. Well, Captain <hi>Beans!</hi> you will be call'd to an Account for this here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. The Boatſwain, after the Captain's Confinement, moſt barbarouſly inſulted him, reproaching him with ſtriking him, ſaying, Then it was your Time; but now, G—d d—n you, it is mine. The Captain made no reply but this, You are a Scoundrel for uſing a Gentleman ill when he is a Priſoner. When the Captain was a Priſoner, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, he never intended to go to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, having more Honour than to turn his Back on his Enemies; and farther, he ſaid, Gentlemen, I do not want to go off in any of your Craft; for I never deſign'd to go for <hi>England,</hi> and would rather chuſe to be ſhot by you; there is not a ſingle Man on the Beach dare engage me; but this is what I fear'd.</p>
            <p>It is very odd, that Capt. <hi>Cheap</hi> ſhould now declare he never intended to go to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when he publickly gave his Word and Honour he would go that Way, or any Way where the Spirit of the People led: But he
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:007859_0126_102DDB3E08F17978"/>afterwards told his Officers, he knew he had a ſevere Trial to go through, if ever he came to <hi>England;</hi> and as for thoſe who liv'd to return to their Country, the only Favour he requeſted from them, was to declare the Truth, without Favour or Prejudice; and this we promis'd faithfully to do: His Words, in this reſpect, were as much regarded by us as the Words of a dying Man, and have been moſt punctually obſerv'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> the 10th, little Wind at N. and N. W. Getting all ready for going off this Afternoon, the Captain ſent for the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant and me, deſiring us both to go to Captain <hi>Pemberton,</hi> to know what he intended to do with him. We accordingly came, and both promis'd to go directly, and bring him his Anſwer. When we came out, went to the Lieutenant's Tent; from thence I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and made no doubt, but he would go to Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi>'s: But when I aſk'd him; he refus'd; which very much ſurpriz'd me. I thought it very ungenerous to triflle with Captain <hi>Cheap,</hi> or any Gentleman in his unhappy Situation; therefore went alone to Captain <hi>Pemberton.</hi> When I deliver'd him Captain <hi>Cheap</hi>'s Meſſage, the Anſwer was, I deſign, and muſt carry him Priſoner to
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:007859_0127_102DDB4053BCC7B8"/>
               <hi>England.</hi> I return'd, and acquainted Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> with Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi>'s Anſwer: He ask'd me then, if the Lieutenant was with me. I told him, No; and I believe did not deſign it. He ſaid, Mr. <hi>Bulkeley,</hi> I am very much oblig'd to you, and could not think the Lieutenant would uſe me thus. In the Evening the Lieutenant and I were ſent for again: The Captain ſaid to the Lieutenant, Sir, have you been with Captain <hi>Pemberton?</hi> He anſwer'd, No, Sir. I thought, Sir, you promis'd me you would: However, I have his Anſwer from Mr. <hi>Bulkeley;</hi> I am to be carry'd a Priſoner to <hi>England.</hi> Gentlemen, I ſhall never live to ſee <hi>England,</hi> but die by Inches in the Voyage; and it is ſurprizing to me to think, what you can expect by going to the Southward, where there are ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand Difficulties to be encounter'd with: I am ſorry ſo many brave Fellows ſhould be led to go where they are not acquainted, when, by going to the Northward, there is the Iſland of <hi>Chili,</hi> not above ninety Leagues, where we need not fear taking Prizes, and may have a Chance to ſee the Commodore. I made Anſwer, Sir, you have ſaid, that we ſhall be call'd to an Account for this in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> I muſt tell you, for my Part, had I
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:007859_0128_102DDB4244146348"/>been guilty of any Crime, and was ſure of being hang'd for it in <hi>England,</hi> I would make it my Choice to go there, ſooner than to the Northward: Have not you given your Word and Honour to go to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? It is true, there is a Chance in going to the Northward, by delivering us from this unhappy Situation of Life to a worſe, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Priſon. The Captain ſaid no more but this, Gentlemen, I wiſh you well, and ſafe to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday</hi> the 11th, this Morning the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſent for me, and told me, he had rather be ſhot than carried off a Priſoner, and that he would not go off with us; therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired me to ask the People to ſuffer him to remain on the Iſland: The People readily agreed to his requeſt; and alſo conſented to leave him all Things needful for his Support, as much as could be ſpar'd. Lieutenant <hi>Hamilton</hi> and the Surgeon choſe to ſtay with him. We offer'd him alſo the Barge and Yawl, if he could procure Men to go with him. The Queſtion was propos'd before the whole Body; but they all cry'd aloud for <hi>England,</hi> and let him ſtay and be d—n'd; does he want to carry us to Priſon? There is not a Man will go. The Captain being
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:007859_0129_102DDB43DE9B24E0"/>depriv'd of his Command in the Manner above-mentioned, and for the reaſons already given, it was reſolv'd to draw ſome Articles to be ſign'd for the Good of the Community, and to give the Lieutenant a limited Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. The Paper was drawn up in this Manner:</p>
            <p>WHereas Captain <hi>David Cheap,</hi> our Commander in his Majeſty's Ship the <hi>Wager,</hi> never conſulted any of his Officers for the Safety and Preſervation of the ſaid Ship, and his Majeſty's Subjects thereto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing; but ſeveral Times, ſince the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Loſs of the ſaid Ship, he has been ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited in the moſt dutiful Manner, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing him at the ſame Time to ſupport his Command with our Lives, deſiring no more than to go off Heart in Hand from this Place to the Southward, which he gave his Word and Honour to do; and being almoſt ready for ſailing, did apply to him, ſome few Days paſt, to draw up ſome proper Articles, in order to ſuppreſs Mutiny, and other material Things, which were thought neceſſary to be agreed to before we went off; but he, in the moſt ſcornful Manner, hath rejected every Thing propos'd for the Publick Good; and
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:007859_0130_102DDB45CF72AE70"/>as he is now a Priſoner, and the Command given to the Lieutenant, upon his Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the following Articles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> As we have no Conveniency for dreſſing Proviſions on Board the Veſſel for a third Part of the Number to be carried off the Spot, therefore this Day ſerv'd ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> to every Man and Boy twelve Days Proviſion, for them to dreſs before we go off; and alſo it is agreed, that whoever is guilty of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding another of any Part of his Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, on ſufficient Proof thereof, the Perſon found guilty (without any reſpect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon) ſhall be put on Shore at the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Place, and left there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In regard to the Boats going off with us, we think proper to allow one Week's Proviſion for each Man appointed to go in them, in order to prevent Separation from each other, which would be of the worſt Conſequence of any Thing that can happen to us; to prevent which we do agree, that when under-way they ſhall not ſeparate, but always keep within Musket-ſhot, and on no Pretence or Excuſe whatſoever go beyond that reach. The Officer, or any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, that ſhall attempt a Separation, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:007859_0131_102DDB48333A51A0"/>the above mention'd Bounds, ſhall, on Proof, be put on ſhore and left behind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> It is agreed, in order to ſuppreſs Mutiny, and prevent Broils and Quarrels on Board the Veſſel, that no Man ſhall threaten the Life of another, or offer Violence in any Shape; the Offender, without any reſpect of Station or Quality, being found guilty, ſhall be put on Shore, and left behind.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> We do agree, whatever Fowl, Fiſh, or Neceſſaries of Life, we ſhall hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to meet with in our Paſſage, the ſame ſhall be divided among the whole; and if Captain <hi>David Cheap</hi> ſhall be put on Board a Priſoner, it ſhall not be in the Lieutenant's Power to releaſe him.</p>
            <p>The aforeſaid Articles were agreed to, and ſign'd by the under-mentioned.

            <p>At Eleven in the Forenoon, the whole Body of People embark'd, to the Number of eighty-one Souls; fifty-nine on Board the Veſſel, on Board the Cutter twelve, and in the Barge ten: At Noon got under Sail, the Wind at N. W. by W. The Captain, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, and Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> being on the Shore-ſide, we gave them three Cheers; which they return'd. Coming out of <hi>Wager</hi>'s Bay ſplit the Fore-ſail, and very narrowly eſcap'd the rocks; with the Aſſiſtance of the Barge, and our own Oars, tow'd her clear, and bore away, into a large ſandy Bay, on the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide of the <hi>Lagoon,</hi> which we call'd by the Name of the <hi>Speedwell</hi> Bay. At Four in the
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:007859_0138_102DDB561053F650"/>Afternoon anchor'd in ten Fathom, fine Sand; the Barge and Cutter went aſhore, there not being room on Board the Boat to lodge the People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 14th, freſh Gales at S. W. and W. with rain. At three this Afternoon, being fair Weather, weigh'd, and came to Sail; to take a Cruize up the <hi>Lagoon,</hi> to try the Veſſel, it being ſmooth Water, ſhe work'd very well; after three or four Trips return'd, and anchor'd where we came from.</p>

               <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 15th, This Morning, it being Calm, made a Signal for the Boats to come off, by firing five Muſkets. At Day-light came to Sail, with the Wind at W. by N. It blowing hard, and a great Swell, the Veſſel would not work; therefore we were oblig'd to put into a ſmall Bay, lying S. W. of <hi>Harvey</hi>'s Bay, where we had a very good Shelter, there being a large Ledge of rocks without us, which broke the Sea off. At Eleven we ſent the Barge to <hi>Cheap</hi>'s Bay for what Canvaſs could be found ſerviceable, having left a ſufficient Quantity behind, to ſupply us with Sails, in Caſe we wanted 'em. Went in the Barge the Hon. <hi>John Byron,</hi> at his own requeſt, <hi>Alexander Campbell</hi> Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipman, <hi>William Harvey</hi> Quarter-Gunner, <hi>David Buckley</hi> ditto, <hi>William Roſe</hi> Quarter-Maſter, <hi>Richard Noble</hi> ditto, <hi>Peter Plaſtow</hi> Captain's Steward, <hi>Joſeph Clinch</hi> Seaman, and <hi>Rowland Cruſſet</hi> Marine. This Afternoon the Carpenter want aſhore in the Cutter, with
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:007859_0141_102DDB5BF08EB1D0"/>ſeveral of the People, to look for Proven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Shot ſeveral Geeſe, and other Sea-Fowl; rainy Weather. Wind W. N. W.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> the 16th, continual rain, and hard Gales all Night at S. W. This Morning the Carpenter came on Board, and acquainted us that he ſaw an Anchor of ſeven Feet in the Shank, the Palm of each Arm filed off juſt above the Crown: This Anchor we ſuppoſe to have belong'd to ſome ſmall Veſſel wreck'd on the Coaſt. The Cutter brought off Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Shell-fiſh ready dreſs'd for the People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday</hi> the 18th, at Noon, the Cutter came off, and brought aboard Plenty of Shell-fiſh and Greens. The Honourable Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> and three of the Barge's Crew, came from where the Barge lay. Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> came aboard, and inform'd us of the Barge's being ſafe in the Bay, where we left her, and only waited the Opportunity of Weather to come round with her: At the ſame Time he deſired to know, if we would give him, and thoſe who would ſtay with Captain <hi>Cheap,</hi> their Share of Proviſions. This Queſtion of Mr. <hi>Byron</hi>'s very much ſurpriz'd us; and what ſurpriz'd us more was, that he ſhould be influenc'd by Mr. <hi>Campbell,</hi> a Perſon whom he always held in Contempt. As for my
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:007859_0142_102DDB5EA5EBC768"/>Part, believe Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> left us becauſe he could not get any Accomodation aboard the Veſſel that he lik'd, being oblig'd to lie forward with the Men; as were alſo the Carpenter and myſelf, when below: It is very certain, that we are ſo cloſely pent up for want of room, that the worſt Jail in <hi>England</hi> is a Palace to our preſent Situation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 20th, ſerv'd out to the People eight Days Flour, to be dreſs'd aſhore. I went in the Cutter to Command in my Turn for a Week.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 21ſt, cloſe Weather; the Wind from W. to N. W. with rain and Hail. Brought aboard Shell-fiſh in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. At Noon the Honourable Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> came with ſome of the Crew Over-land; he aſk'd me, whether the Boat's Crew were gone off, and if we had ſerv'd the Proviſion, for he wanted to return to the Barge. I told him all the People were out a Fiſhing, and that the firſt who came in ſhould carry him off. On which he ſaid, I think we will go and get ſome Fiſh too, having nothing elſe to live on. This was the laſt Time I ever ſaw his Honour. When the People return'd from fiſhing, they told me Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> had loſt his Hat, the Wind blowing it off his Head,
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:007859_0143_102DDB60E8E29D20"/>I ſaid, rather than he ſhould want a Hat, I would give him my own. One of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men forced a Hat on his Head; his Name was <hi>John Duck:</hi> But Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> would by no Means wear it; ſaying, <hi>John!</hi> I thank you; if I accept of your Kindneſs, you muſt go bare-headed; and, I think, I can bear Hardſhips as well as the beſt of you, and muſt uſe myſelf to them. I took eight Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and went over Land to the Place where the Barge lay, to get the Canvaſs that we ſtood ſo much in Need of; but found ſhe was gone from thence. The People in the Barge told our Men, that they would return to us again; but it is plain they never intended it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 22d, This Day we ſaw Sea-Fowl in vaſt Flocks flying to the Southward, where was a dead Whale. Look'd out all this Day for the Barge, but to no Purpoſe. The Barge not returning was a very great Misfortune, having no Boat but the Cutter; and if by an unlucky Accident we loſe her, we muſt be reduced to the greateſt Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to get Proviſion. The Perſons in the Barge, except the Captain's Steward, always approv'd of going to the Southward; but it ſeems Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> the Patroon prevail'd on 'em to return to Captain <hi>Cheap.</hi>

               <hi>Friday</hi> the 23d, Saw Thouſands of Sea-Fowl; in the Morning they fly to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and in the Evening come back to the South; they are Birds of a very large Size, but of what Kind we do not know. Since we have been here we ſaw ſeveral <hi>Indian</hi> Graves; they are dug juſt within the Surface of the Earth, with a Board on each Side, and a Croſs ſtuck up at the Head. The Day following a Gun, a four Pounder, was ſeen near the Anchor in <hi>Clam</hi> Bay; we call it by this Name, becauſe of the vaſt Quantities of this Sort of Shell-fiſh which are found there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> the 26th, it being very calm, and fair Weather, I went aſhore to bring off the People; weigh'd the Long-Boat, and took her in Tow over a Bar, where was ten Feet Water, but a great Swell; as ſoon we got over the Bar, there ſprung up a Breeze of Wind at N. W. ſteer'd away S. half E. for the Southmoſt Part of Land, which bore S. by E. diſtant fourteen Leagues. The two Points of Land make a large and deep ſandy Bay; we ſounded, but found no Ground; it is a bold Shore cloſe to. I kept a-head in the Cutter, in order to provide a Harbour for the Long-Boat; Providence directed us to a very good one: It blew ſo hard, with thick
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:007859_0145_102DDB6460DD48C8"/>hazy Weather, that we could not keep the Sea. At Eight at Night we anchor'd in eight Fathom Water a-breaſt of a fine ſandy Bay, and Land lock'd not above three Boats Length from the Shores: At the Entrance of the Harbour, which lies about a League up the <hi>Lagoon,</hi> I ſet the Land; the Northmoſt Point bore by the Compaſs N. by E. diſtant twelve Leagues, and the Southmoſt S. by W. diſtant five Leagues, the Entrance lies E.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 27th, Freſh Gales at W. and cloudy Weather, with a great Swell without, inſomuch that we could not put out to Sea; we therefore ſent the People aſhore to dreſs their Proviſions: each Man is allow'd but a Quarter of a Pound of Flour <hi>per</hi> Day, without any other Subſiſtence, but what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence brings in our Way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 29th, Early this Morning, it being calm and thick Weather, with ſmall rain, we rowed out of the <hi>Lagoon;</hi> at Five it cleared up, with a freſh Breeze at S. S. E. ſteer'd S. W. and S. W. by W. ſaw a ſmall Iſland bearing S. by W. the Southmoſt End S. by E. This Iſland we call the rock of <hi>Dundee,</hi> it being much like that Iſland in the <hi>Weſt-Indies;</hi> but not ſo large, it lieth about four Leagues diſtant from the Southmoſt
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:007859_0146_102DDB675604DF10"/>Point of Land out at Sea. This Day it blow'd ſo hard, that we were oblig'd to take the Cutter in Tow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> the 30th, Hard Gales, and a great Sea; ſaw ſome Iſlands and ſome ſunken rocks; at Six ſaw the Main in two Points of Land, with a large Opening; on each Side <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he ſunken rocks are innumerable; the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance is ſo dangerous, that no Mortal would attempt it, unleſs his Caſe was deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as ours; we having nothing but Death before our Eyes in keeping the Sea, and the ſame Proſpect in running in with the Land: We ran in before the Wind to the Opening that appear'd between the two Points, the Northmoſt of which bore N. by E. and the Southmoſt S. by E. We ſteer'd in E. and found the Opening to be a large <hi>Lagoon,</hi> on the Southmoſt Side, running into a very good Harbour; here our ſmall Veſſel lay ſecure in a Cove, which Nature had form'd like a Dock; we had no Occaſion to let go an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, but ran along-ſide the Land, and made faſt our Head and Stern. The People went aſhore in Search of Proviſion; here we found Plenty of Wood and Water, and fine large Muſſels in great Quantities. Serv'd to each Man half a Piece of Beef.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="115" facs="unknown:007859_0147_102DDB68EF1A49E0"/>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> the 31ſt, This Morning caſt looſe, and row'd towards the Mouth of the <hi>Lagoons,</hi> deſigning to put out to Sea; but the Wind blew ſo hard, that we were oblig'd to come to an Anchor. This Afternoon, in weighing the Grapenel, in order to go to the Cove, we found it foul among ſome rocks; all Hands haul'd, took a turn round the Main-maſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and went aft; which weigh'd the Grapenel, but ſtreighten'd one of the Flukes: Here the Land is very high and ſteep on each Side; the Carpenter and Cooper were on the higheſt of theſe Hills, and found deep Ponds of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the Top of them; theſe Hills are very rocky, and there are great Falls of Water all along the Coaſt: The whole Navy of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> may lay with Safety in many of thoſe <hi>Lagoons;</hi> but the Coaſt is too dangerous for any Ship to fall in with the Land. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple To-day were very much afflicted with the Gripes, and Pains in their Side. Here are Abundance of Trees, not unlike our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ew Trees: they are not above ſeven or eight Inches in Diameter, and the Bark is like Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar. The Land is to Appearance very good; but on digging beneath the Surface, we find it almoſt an entire Stone. We ſaw no People here, tho', it is plain, here have been ſome
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:007859_0148_102DDB6A8E085C88"/>lately, by their Wigg-wams or Huts. We are ſo cloſely pent up for want of room, that our Lodging is very uncomfortable; the Stench of the Mens wet Cloaths makes the Air we breathe nauſeous to that Degree, that one would think it impoſſible for a Man to live below. We came to ſail, and ſteer'd out of the <hi>Lagoon</hi> Weſt; went into a ſandy Bay, one League to the Southward of the <hi>Lagoon, Indian</hi> Huts to be ſeen, but no Natives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday, November</hi> the 2d, at Five in the Morning, came to ſail with the Wind at S. and S. by E. At Noon the Wind came to the W. and W.N.W. in ſmall Breezes: This Day I had a very good Obſervation, it being the firſt ſince we left <hi>Cheap</hi>'s Iſland. We found ourſelves in the Latitude of 50:00 S. After obſerving, bore away, and ran into a fine ſmooth Paſſage between the Iſland and the Main. Theſe Iſlands I believe to be the ſame that are taken Notice of in <hi>Cook</hi>'s Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. From the Entrance to the Northward, to the going out of the Cape of <hi>Good Hope</hi> (as we call it) the Diſtance is about ſix Leagues, and the Depth of Water is from two Fathom to twelve; the Northmoſt Land before we came into the Paſſage bore N. by W.
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:007859_0149_102DDB6D49ECFC30"/>and the Southmoſt, or Cape of <hi>Good Hope</hi> bore S. by E. In the Evening anchored in a fine ſandy Bay: Here we alſo ſaw <hi>Indian</hi> Huts, but no People; To-day we ſhot wild Geeſe in Abundance, and got of Shell-Fiſh, as Limpets and Muſſels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 3d, At Four this Morning weighed, and came to ſail with the Wind at W. till we got about the Cape of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> then at W. N. W. ſteering S. and a tumbling Sea from the W. The Cutter ſteer'd S. by E. into a deep Bay; ſuppoſing them not to ſee the Southmoſt Land, we made the Signal for her, by hoiſting an Enſign at the Topping-Lift; as the Cutter was coming up to us, her ſquare Sail ſplitted; we offered to take them in Tow, but they would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it; we lay with our Sails down ſome time before they would ſhow any Signal of making Sail; coming before the Wind, and a large Sea, we ordered them to ſteer away for the Southmoſt Point of Land after us, and to keep as near as poſſible: but inſtead of obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Directions, they ſteered away into the Cod of a deep Bay, ſuppoſed to be <hi>King</hi>'s Bay: The Cutter being much to Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the Weather coming on very thick, we were obliged to ſteer after her, but ſoon
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:007859_0150_102DDB6EE80E2298"/>loſt Sight of her. The Place being exceeding dangerous, we could not venture any farther after the Cutter; therefore we hauled by the Wind to the Southward; it continued blowing hard, with thick Weather, with ſunken rocks, and Breakers, ſo that we were obliged to bear away before the Wind into a large Bay, the Tide running rampant, and in a great Swell, every where ſurrounded with ſunken rocks, that we thought nothing but a Miracle could ſave us; at laſt we got ſafe into the Bay, and came to in two Fathom Water, we ſteered in E.

When they found we would not go into that Bay, they hoiſted their Mainſail, and went a-head; being ſome Diſtance a-head, we made ſail, the Cutter ſtill keeping a-head till One o'Clock, then ſhe bore away

At half an Hour paſt Two, the Cutter being on the Beam, and four Miles within us, we bore away after them; and in a very heavy Squall of Wind and rain we loſt ſight of her: After the Squall was over, it cleared up, but we ſaw nothing of the Cutter, nor could we clear the Shore to the Northward, being not above two Miles off the Breakers; therefore we were under a Neceſſity of hauling to the ſouthward for Self-preſervation, and very narrowly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcaped clearing the rocks: After running about three Lragues, ſaw an Opening, where we hoped to find a good Harbour; bore away for the Opening, we were here again ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with rocks and Breakers, with a hard Gale of Wind, and a great Sea, the oldeſt Seaman on board never ſaw a more diſmal Proſpect; we ran in before the Wind for about two Leagues, expecting every riſe and Fall of the Sea to be a Wreck, but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence at length conducted us to an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Place of Shelter: We are now in a moſt wretched Condition, having no Boat to go

<pb n="123" facs="unknown:007859_0155_102DDB79D3146640"/>Night the proper Boat's Crew would not go Aſhore with the Boat as uſual, but made her faſt a-ſtern of the Veſſel, with only two Men in her, ſhe never being left without four before; at Eleven at Night one of the Men came out of her into the Veſſel, it blowing very hard at N. N. E. in half an Hour ſhifted to N. W. and rainy Weather, that we could not ſee a Boat's Length: At Two the next Morning the Cutter broke looſe from the Stern of the Veſſel; we called from on Board to <hi>James Stewart,</hi> the Man that was in her, but he could not hear us; in a ſhort Time we loſt ſight of her, believing ſhe muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

The Loſs of the Cutter gives the few thinking People aboard a great deal of Uneaſineſs; we have ſeventy-two Men in the Veſſel, and not above ſix of that Number that give themſelves the leaſt Concern for the Preſervation of their Lives, but are rather the reverſe, being <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They will not hearken to reaſon; therefore we are obliged to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with their Demands, and ſerve out Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions accordingly. Several of the People have deſired to be put on Shore, deſiring us to allow them ſome few Neceſſaries: We wanted to know what could induce them to requeſt our putting them aſhore in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote and deſolate Part of the World: They anſwer'd, they did not fear doing well, and

On their earneſt Intreaties, the Body of People agreed to their requeſt: We haul'd the Boat cloſe in Shore; the People who choſe to ſtay behind were eleven in Number; we ſupply'd them with proper Neceſſaries, and they ſign'd a Certificate, to inform the Lords of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty that they were not compell'd to ſtay, but made it their own Choice, and that they did it for the Preſervation of themſelves and us.</p>

<pb n="127" facs="unknown:007859_0159_102DDB81C54ECB90"/>got about four Leagues right out, every Way ſurrounded with rocks and Breakers, with a great Weſtern Swell: We found it a very difficult Matter to get clear of thoſe rocks and Breakers, they reach along ſhore eighteen Leagues, and without us at Sea eight Leagues, I take it, that from the Land they are fourteen Leagues in the Offing; thoſe ſunken rocks appear like a low level Land. This Coaſt is too dangerous for Shipping, the Wind being three Parts of the Year to the Weſtward, which blows right on the Shore, with a large Weſtern ſwell, that ſeldom or never ceaſes; it always blows and rains; it is worſe here than in the rainy ſeaſon on the Coaſt of <hi>Guinea;</hi> nor can we as yet diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh Summer from Winter, only by the Length of the Days.

               <hi>E. S. E.</hi> at ſeven made the Land; at Eight ſaw a Point of Land bearing <hi>S.

W.</hi> ſteer'd <hi>S. E.</hi> the Cape bearing <hi>E.</hi> diſtant four Leagues; at Noon bore <hi>E.</hi> by <hi>N.</hi> diſtant ſix Leagues; haul'd the Mainſail down, and went under a Foreſail. I never in my Life, in any Part of the World, have ſeen ſuch a Sea as runs here; we expected every Wave to ſwallow us, and the Boat to founder. This Shore is full of ſmall Iſlands, rocks and Breakers; ſo that we can't haul further to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for fear of endangering the Boat; we are oblig'd to keep her right before the Sea. At Five broach'd to, at which we all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd ſhe would never riſe again. We were ſurrounded with rocks, and ſo near that a Man might toſs a Biſket on them: We had
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:007859_0161_102DDB85A3815330"/>nothing but Death before our Eyes, and every Moment expected our Fate. It blew a Hurricane of Wind, with thick rainy Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that we could not ſee twice the Boat's Length; we pray'd earneſtly for its clearing up, for nothing elſe could ſave us from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing; we no ſooner aſk'd for Light, but it was granted us from above. At the Weather's clearing up, we ſaw the Land on the North-Shore, with Iſlands, Rocks, and Breakers all around us; we were obliged to put in among 'em for Shelter, finding it impoſſible to keep the Sea; we were in with the Land amongſt them, and compell'd to puſh thro', looking Death in the Face, and expecting every Sea to bury us; the boldeſt Men among us were diſmay'd, nor can we poſſibly give an Account in what Manner we have been this Day deliver'd. After ſailing amidſt Iſlands, rocks, and Breakers, for above a League, we got ſafe into a good Harbour, ſurrounded with ſmall Iſlands, which kept the Sea off; here the Water was as ſmooth as in a Mill-pond. We call this Harbour the <hi>Port of God's Mercy,</hi> eſteeming our Preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation this Day to be a Miracle. The moſt abandon'd among us no longer doubt of an
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:007859_0162_102DDB87D04EB690"/>Almighty Being, and have promis'd to reform their Lives.</p>

               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 11th, The Wind much abated, with rain. This Morning weigh'd and ran farther in. In the Evening we ſaw two <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> lying on their Bellies on the Top of a ſteep rock, juſt over the Veſſel, peeping with their Heads over the Hill. As ſoon as we diſcover'd them, we made Motions to them to come down; they then roſe up, and put on their Heads white feather'd Caps; we then hoiſted a white Sheet for an Enſign; at this they made a Noiſe, pronouncing <hi>Orza, Orza;</hi> which we took for a Signal to come aſhore. We would not ſuffer above two Men to go aſhore, and thoſe diſarm'd, leſt we ſhould put them in Fear. The <hi>Indians</hi> had nothing in their Hands but a Club, like to our Cricket-Batts, with which they kill their Seal. As ſoon as they ſaw the two Men come aſhore, they walk'd away; and when they perceiv'd our Men follow'd them, and gain'd Ground of them, they took to their Heels, frequently looking back, crying <hi>Orza, Orza,</hi> beckoning the People to follow, which they did for a Mile or two along Shore, out of Sight of the Veſſel: Then the <hi>Indians</hi> fled to the Woods, ſtill wanting our
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:007859_0163_102DDB89C0EA40C0"/>People to follow them; but being diſarm'd, they were apprehenſive the <hi>Indians</hi> would Buſh-fight them; ſo they thought proper to give over the Purſuit, and to return to the Boat.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 12th, Hard Gales at W.N.W. with rain. At Six this Morning we again ſaw the two <hi>Indians;</hi> they made the ſame Noiſe and Motions to come aſhore; at which I went with four of the People; the <hi>Indians</hi> walk'd and ran as before, looking back, and making Signs to follow, which we did till we got to the Place where the Canoe lay with four <hi>Indians</hi> in her. The two <hi>Indians</hi> got into the Canoe, and put her off the Shore before we could get nigh them; as ſoon as we got a-breaſt of the Canoe, they made Signs as if they wanted Cloathing; we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to make them underſtand we wanted Fiſh, and would truck with them; they had none, but ſignified to us they would go and get ſome: They had a mangey Dog, which they parted with to one of the People for a Pair of Cloth Trowſers; this Dog was ſoon kill'd, dreſs'd, and devour'd. Here we found Plenty of Muſſels, which gave us great re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, having ſcarce any Thing to ſubſiſt on for this Week paſt.</p>

               <hi>Friday</hi> the 13th, Very uncertain Weather, and ſqually; the Wind variable from W.N.W. to S.S.W. This Morning all Hands aſhore a fiſhing. Lieutenant <hi>Ewers</hi> of the Marines kill'd a large Seal or Sea-Dog; it is exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good Food, and we judg'd it to have weigh'd ſeventeen Score.</p>

               <hi>Saturday</hi> the 14th, Little Wind at W.N.W. and cloſe Weather, with rain. At Five this Morning caſt looſe, and ſteer'd South out be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Iſlands; the Weather clearing up, we ſaw the South Shore; it firſt appear'd like a large Iſland, ſtretching away to the Weſtward, and at the Weſt-End two Hom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macoes like Sugar-loaves, and to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of them a large Point of rocks; ſteer'd S.E. until the Point bore W. then ſteer'd S.E. by E.

This Day ſeveral People drove a Trade with their Allowance, giving Silver Buckles for Flour, valued at twelve Shilling <hi>per</hi> Pound, and before Night it reach'd to a Guinea, the

               <hi>Monday</hi> the 16th, At Three this Morning caſt looſe, being little Wind, and ſteer'd up the <hi>Streights</hi> S. E. by E. the Wind at N. W. At Eight o'Clock got a-breaſt of Cape <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day;</hi> at Nine the Cape bore W. diſtant four Leagues; at Noon running along Shore, made two Openings, which put the reſt of the Officers to a Stand, not knowing which to take for the right Paſſage. Aſking my Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, I gave it for keeping on the E. S. E. Paſſage, the other lying S. E. by S. On which they ſaid, Sir <hi>John Narborough</hi> bids us keep the South Shore on Board. I an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd, That Sir <hi>John</hi> tells us E. S E. is the direct Courſe from Cape <hi>Pillar;</hi> I'll venture my Life that we are now in the right Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; ſo we kept on E. by S. half S. After running a League or two up, and not ſeeing Cape <hi>Quod,</hi> nor any Outlet, the Wind blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hard, we were for running no farther, whereas one League more would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinc'd every Body; but they all gave it a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt me, that we were not in the right Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. The Wind being at W. N. W. we could not turn back again ſo that we were oblig'd
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:007859_0166_102DDB90056FA1D0"/>to put into a Cove lying on the North Shore, where we found good anchoring in four Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thom Water no Proviſions to be got here, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a barren rocky Place, producing not any Thing for the Preſervation of Life. This Afternoon died <hi>George Bateman,</hi> a Boy, aged ſixteen Years; This poor Creature ſtarv'd, periſh'd, and died a Skeleton, for want of Food. There are ſeveral more in the ſame miſerable Condition, and who, without a ſpeedy relief, muſt undergo the ſame Fate.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 17th, At Five this Morning weigh'd and row'd out, it being calm: at Seven a freſh Breeze right up the Sound; we could not turn to Windward not above a Mile from where we laſt lay; we made faſt along Side the rocks; all Hands aſhore a fiſhing for Muſſels, Limpets, and Clams; here we found thoſe Shell-fiſh in Abundance, which prov'd a very ſeaſonable relief. Juſt before we got in, one of the Men gave a Guinea for a Pound of Flour, being all the Money he had.</p>

               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 18th, The Wind W. N. W. in hard Squalls, with Hail and Snow. This Morning caſt looſe, and ſtood over to the Southward, believing the Tide to run ſtronger and more true than on the North-ſhore, ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:007859_0167_102DDB91ED804120"/>ſhortly to get out of the Sound, which is not above a League in the Wind's Eye. At Two o'Clock got into a Cove on the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide; made faſt along Side of the rocks; all Hands on Shore getting Muſſels, and other Fiſh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 19th, Freſh Gales at W. N. W. with Hail and Snow. This Morning caſt looſe, and ſail'd out, but could make no Hand of it; our Boat will not work to Windward; put back from whence we came, and ſent the People aſhore to get Muſſels. This Night departed this Life Mr. <hi>Thomas Caple,</hi> Son of the late Lieutenant <hi>Caple,</hi> aged twelve Years, who periſh'd for want of Food. There was a Perſon on Board who had ſome of the Youth's Money, upwards of twenty Guineas, with a Watch and Silver Cup. Thoſe laſt the Boy was willing to ſell for Flour; but his Guardian told him, he would buy Cloaths for him in the <hi>Brazil.</hi> The miſerable Youth cry'd, Sir, I ſhall never live to ſee the <hi>Brazil;</hi> I am ſtarving now, almoſt ſtarv'd to Death; therefore, for G—d's Sake, give me my Sil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Cup to get me ſome Victuals, or buy ſome for me yourſelf. All his Prayer's and Intreaties to him were vain; but Heaven ſent Death to his relief, and put a Period to his
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:007859_0168_102DDB948B0BD5C8"/>Miſeries in an Inſtant. Perſons who have not experienc'd the Hardſhips we have met with, will wonder how People can be ſo inhuman to ſee their Fellow-Creatures ſtarving before their Faces, and afford 'em no relief: But Hunger is void of all Compaſſion: every Perſon was ſo intent on the Preſervation of his own Life, that he was regardleſs of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's, and the Bowels of Commiſeration were ſhut up. We ſlip no Opportunity, Day or Night, to enter into the ſuppoſed right <hi>Streights,</hi> but can get no Ground. This Day we ſerv'd Flour and a Piece of Beef be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two Men for a Week. Capt. <hi>Pember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> of his Majeſty's Land Forces, gave two Guineas for two Pounds of Flour; this Flour was ſold him by the Seamen, who live on Muſſels. Many of the People eat their Flour raw as ſoon as they are ſerv'd it. The Wind and Weather not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting us to go out, the Men were employ'd in getting Wood and Water.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 24th, This Morning, it being calm, row'd out; at Eight o'Clock had the ſuppoſed right <hi>Streights</hi> open, having a Breeze at W. N. W. S. E. by E. through the firſt reach, and S. S. E. through the ſecond; then ſaw three Iſlands, the largeſt of which lies
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:007859_0169_102DDB96285F24E0"/>on the North-ſhore; and there is a Paſſage about two Miles broad between that and the Iſlands to the Southward; there is alſo ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Paſſage between that Iſland and the North-ſhore, of a Mile and a half broad. Before you come to thoſe Iſlands there is a Sound lying on the South-ſhore: You can ſee no Sea-Paſſage until you come cloſe up with the Iſland, and then the imaginary <hi>Streights</hi> are not above two Miles broad. Steer'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way for the Iſland S. E. about two Leagues; then came into a narrow Paſſage, not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a Cable's Length over, which put us all to a ſtand, doubting of any farther Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage. The Wind took us a-head, and the Tide being ſpent, we put into a ſmall Cove, and made faſt. At Seven in the Evening, being calm, caſt looſe, being willing to ſee if there was any Opening; but, to our great Misfortune, found none; which very much ſurpriz'd us. The Lieutenant is of Opinion, that we are in a <hi>Lagoon</hi> to the Northward of the <hi>Streights.</hi> This I cannot believe; and am poſitive, if ever there was ſuch a Place in the World as the <hi>Streights of Magellan,</hi> we are now in them and above thirty Leagues up. If he, or any of the Officers, had given themſelves the Trouble of coming upon Deck,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:007859_0170_102DDB9831C55D10"/>to have made proper remarks, we had been free from all this Perplexity, and by this Time out of the <hi>Streights</hi> to the Northward. There is not an Officer aboard, except the Carpenter and myſelf, will keep the Deck a Moment longer than this Watch, or has any regard to a reckoning, or any Thing elſe. It is agreed to go back again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 25th, Little Wind, with rain. At Eight this Morning row'd out, and got about a League down; here we could get no Ground, and were oblig'd to put back again.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 26th, Little Wind; row'd out, got about five Leagues down. This Day we were in ſuch want of Proviſions, that we were forc'd to cut up the Seal-Skin and boil it, notwithſtanding it has lain about the Deck for this Fortnight.</p>

Great Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs among the People, many of them de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpairing of a Deliverance, and crying aloud to ſerve Proviſions four Days before the Time. Finding no Way to pacify them, we were oblig'd to ſerve them. We endeavour'd to encourage and comfort them as much as lay in our Power, and at length they ſeem'd tolerably eaſy.</p>

In the Morning put out of the Cove, and got four Leagues down; then the Wind took us ahead, and we put into another Cove, where we got Muſſels and Limpets. At Four this Afternoon ſaw an <hi>Indian</hi> Canoe coming over from the North-ſhore; they landed two of their Men to Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of the Cove; they came oppoſite to us, and view'd us; then went back, and came with the Canoe within a Cable's Length of our Boat, but no nearer; ſo that we had no Opportunity to truck with them.</p>

               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 2d, Little Wind, with rain. At Nine this Morning row'd out, and got about a League farther down; the Wind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning to blow freſh, we put into another Cove, and found Plenty of Shell-fiſh, which kept up our Spirits greatly; for it is enough to deject any thinking Man, to ſee that the Boat will not turn to Windward; being of ſuch Length, and ſwimming ſo poynant upon the Water, that the Wind, when cloſe haul'd, throws her quite to Leeward: We have been ſeventeen Days going ſeven or eight Leagues
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:007859_0173_102DDB9E5A778B10"/>to Windward, which muſt make our Paſſage very long and uncomfortable.</p>

We put off again with a fine Breeze, ſteering N. W. by W. down the <hi>Streights.</hi> The Carpenter gave a Guinea this Day for a Pound of Flour, which he made into Cakes, and eat inſtantly.

               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 8th, At Four this Morning, being calm, weighed, and rowed towards <hi>Elizabeth's Iſland,</hi> it bearing W. N. W. At Four in the Afternoon anchor'd off the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſtſide in eight Fathom Water, fine Sand, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half a Cable's Length from the Shore, put the Veſſel in, and landed ſome People to ſee for Wood and Water: In the Evening the People came aboard, having been all over the Iſland in ſearch of Wood and Water, but found none; here indeed we found Shaggs and Sea-Gulls in great Numbers, it being Breed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Time; we got a vaſt Quantity of their Eggs, moſt of them having young ones in the Shell: However, we beat them up all together, with a little Flour, and made a very rich Pudding. <hi>Elizabeth's Iſland</hi> is a beautiful Spot of Ground to Appearance, with very good Paſture; but it is intirely barren of any thing for the Support of Man.

W. when a-breaſt of the <hi>Sweepſtakes-Foreland,</hi> ſteered S. S. E. on Purpoſe to look for Water; after going along ſhore about fix Leagues, into a deep Bay, we ſaw a fine delightful Country: Here we ſaw the Guianacoes in great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, ten or twelve in a Drove; they are to be ſeen in ſuch Droves all along the Shore for ſeveral Leagues.</p>
            <p>The Guianacoe is as large as any <hi>Engliſh</hi> Deer, with a long Neck; his Head, Mouth, and Ears, reſembling a Sheep; he has very long ſlender Legs, and is cloven-footed like a Deer, with a ſhort Buſhy Tail, of a reddiſh Colour; his Back is covered with red Wool, pretty long; but down his Sides, and all the Belly Part, is white Wool: Thoſe Guianacoes, though, at a Diſtance, very much reſembling the Female Deer, are probably the Sheep of this Country: They are exceeding nimble, of an exquiſite quick Sight, very ſhy, and difficult to be ſhot; at Noon, finding neither Wood nor Water, wore to the Northward: At Three got a-breaſt of the <hi>Foreland,</hi> hauled in for <hi>Fiſh Cove,</hi> which lieth juſt round the Eaſtern Point; here we expected to land, and
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:007859_0178_102DDBA835C05870"/>ſhoot ſome of thoſe Guianacoes; but when a-breaſt of the <hi>Cove,</hi> the Wind blew ſo hard right out, that we were obliged to bear a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way for the firſt <hi>Narrow,</hi> it being impoſſible to get in. At Eight this Evening entered the firſt <hi>Narrow,</hi> meeting the Flood, which runs here very ſtrong: At Twelve came to an Anchor in five Fathom, about a Mile off Shore: The Tide floweth on the Weſtern Shore ſeven Hours, and ebbs five. This Day <hi>Robert Vicars</hi> Marine periſhed with Want.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thurſday</hi> the 10th, At Four this Morning weighed, and came to ſail; at ſix got out of the firſt <hi>Narrow,</hi> hauled in for a deep Bay on the N. ſhore to ſeek for Water: The Boatſwain ſwam aſhore, and in half an Hour afterwards came down on the Beach, and brought us the News of finding freſh Water: It being rocky Ground, and ebbing Water, the Veſſel ſtruck; we were oblig'd, in this Exigence, to ſlip the Cable, Time not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting us to haul up the Anchor; we ſtood off and on the Shore till half Flood; then went in, and took the Cable on Board: After landing ſome People with Caſks to fill, haul'd the Anchor up, and went about two Miles farther out.</p>

               <hi>Friday</hi> the 11th, At Three this Morning the Boat ſtruck upon the Tide of Ebb; it ebbing ſo faſt, we could not get her off; in a Quarter of an Hour's Time the Boat was dry; we were favour'd with little Wind and ſmooth Water, otherwiſe ſhe muſt have ſtove to Pieces, the Ground being very foul; it ebbs dry above a League off, and there is Shoal Water a great deal further out; ſo that it is dangerous for a Ship to haul into this Bay. While the Boat was dry, got all the Water-Caſks out of the Hold, and put them aſhore to be fill'd. At ſix haul'd the Boat off, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving receiv'd no Damage; at Eight, it being four Feet Flood, run the Boat cloſe in Shore, and took off our Water, the whole Quantity being four Tons, out of which we were oblig'd to leave two Puncheons, one Quarter-Caſk, with three Muſkets, a Funnel, and ſome other Neceſſaries; and were very much concern'd, leſt we ſhould alſo leave ſome of the People aſhore.

On Sight of this, we anchor'd within a Mile of the Shore. The Cape bore <hi>W. S. W.</hi> diſtant ſeven Leagues; the Swell tumbling in from the Sea, would not permit us to ſpeak with 'em; by their Motions, Actions, Cloathing, and, by their whole Behaviour, we took them for
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:007859_0182_102DDBB04A2D25F8"/>Chriſtians: It being a plain level Land, they rode backwards and forwards like racers, waving white Hankerchiefs, and making Signs for us to go into a Bay, which lay about a League to the Northward; which we de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd to do on the Tide of Ebb. The Flood being very ſtrong againſt us, they waited on the Shore till the Tide was ſpent; we weigh'd and ſtood to Northward; the Wind blowing right in from the Sea, and a great ſwell, we could not clear the Land; ſo that we wore and ſtood to the Southward, and very nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowly eſcap'd clearing the Breakers off the Pitch of the Cape, which lay about two Leagues out at Sea to the Southward. At Nine at Night the Cape bore W. diſtant ſix Leagues; ſtood out to Sea till Eleven o'Clock, then wore and ſtood in, the Wind ſhifting to N. N. E. The next Morning we ſteer'd in for the Bay, and ſaw thoſe People again; but the Wind ſoon afterwards veering to the Weſtward, and blowing ſtrong, we were oblig'd to bear away: We could not by any Means come to the Knowledge of theſe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; whether they are unfortunate Creatures that have been caſt away, or whether they are Inhabitants about the river <hi>Gallegoes,</hi> we can't tell.</p>

               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 16th, At Noon a-breaſt of <hi>Penguin</hi> Iſland, not above half a Mile from Shore. We ſaw on this Iſland Seals and Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guins without Number, the Shore being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely cover'd with them. We find the Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guin exactly to anſwer Sir <hi>John Narborough</hi>'s Deſcription; therefore we beg Leave to give it the reader in that excellent Navigator's own Word. <q>
                  <hi>The Penguin is a Fowl that lives by catching and eating of Fiſh, which he dives for, and is very nimble in the Water; he is as big as a Brant-Gooſe, and weighs near about eight Pounds; they have no Wings, but flat Stumps like Fins; their Coat is a downy ſlumped Feather; they are blackiſh Grey on the Backs and
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:007859_0184_102DDBB532D8C4F8"/>Heads, and White about their Necks and down their Bellies; they are ſhort-legg'd like a Gooſe, and ſtand upright like little Children in white Aprons, in Companies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; they are full-neck'd, and headed and beaked like a Crow, only the Point of their Bill turns down a little; they will bite hard, but they are very tame, and will drive in Herds to your Boat-ſide like Sheep, and there you may knock 'em on the Head, all one after another; they will not make any great Haſte away.</hi>
               </q> We ſteer'd N. W. by N. for the Harbour of Port <hi>Deſire:</hi> The going into this Harbour is very remarkable; on the South-ſide lies, one Mile in the Land, an high peak'd-up rock, much like a Tower, looking as tho' it was a Work of Art ſet up for a Land-mark to ſteer into this Harbour; this rock is forty Feet high. At Five o'Clock got into the Harbour; run up to <hi>Seal</hi> Iſland, which lieth about a League up; here we kill'd more Seal in half an Hour, than we could carry off, being oblig'd to leave the greateſt Part of what we kill'd behind. The People eating greedily of the Seal, were ſeiz'd with violent Feavers and Pains in their Heads. While we were at Port <hi>Deſire</hi> we had Seal and Fowl in Abundance. The Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:007859_0185_102DDBB6D1789090"/>found here a Parcel of Bricks, ſome of 'em with Letters cut in them; on one of thoſe Bricks theſe Words were very plain and legible, <hi>viz. Capt. Straiton,</hi> 16 <hi>Cannons,</hi> 1687. Thoſe we imagine have been laid here from a Wreck. The Carpenter with ſix Men went in Search of Water; a Mile up the Water's Side they found <hi>Peckett's</hi> Well, mention'd in Sir <hi>John Narborough</hi>'s Book; the Spring is ſo ſmall, that it doth not give above thirty Gallons <hi>per</hi> Day; but the Well being full, ſupplied us. The People grow very turbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent and uneaſy, requiring Flour to be ſerv'd out; which, in our preſent Circumſtances, is a moſt unreaſonable requeſt; we have but one Caſk of Flour on Board, and a great Diſtance to run into the <hi>Brazil,</hi> and no other Proviſion in the Boat but the Seal we have kill'd here: Nay, they carry their Demands much higher, inſiſting that the Marine Officers, and ſuch People as cannot be aſſiſting in working the Boat, ſhall have but half the Allowance of the reſt; accordingly they have pitch'd upon twenty to be ſerv'd half a Pound of Flour each Man, and themſelves a Pound. This Diſtinction the Half-Pounders complain of, and that twenty are ſelected to be ſtarv'd. While we were at Port <hi>Deſire,</hi> one Day dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing

               <hi>Friday</hi> the 25th, Little Wind, and fair Weather, went up to our Slaughter-Houſe in <hi>Seal</hi> Iſland, and took on Board our Sea-ſtore, which we compleated in half an Hour's Time; turn'd down the Harbour with the Tide of Ebb; in the Evening, the Wind at N.

            <p>Thoſe People had a good Proſpect of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Proviſions, and we believe Inhabitants are not far off: they have all Neceſſaries for

At Noon ſail'd hence; at Four in the Afternoon could not clear the Land, and were oblig'd to anchor in five Fathom, two Leagues from the Shore; the Northmoſt Point of Land bore N.

            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 19th, Little Wind at S. and clear Weather. At Four this Morning ſaw Breakers right a-head; ſounded, and found five Fathom; ſaw the Land making like an Iſland, bearing N. E. by E. diſtant twelve Leagues; ſteer'd N. for about a Mile or
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:007859_0197_102DDBCF02CD9EF0"/>two; ſhoal'd the Water from two Fathom to nine Feet; then ſteer'd N. N. E. and deepen'd the Water to five Fathom. By the Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the Land, we are well up the river of <hi>Plate,</hi> and do take the Breakers for the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Bank. Steer'd and ſail'd all Day E. N. E. along Shore; in the Evening anchor'd in a fine ſandy Bay; ſaw two Men coming down on Horſeback; the Boatſwain ſwam aſhore, and got up behind one of them, and rode away to their Caravans. When we made the Land, we had not one Drop of Water on Board: Several People ſwam aſhore to fill Water; one of 'em, when aſhore, drank very plentifully of Water; in attempting to come off, was ſo weak, that he could not reach the Veſſel, but was unfortunately drown'd. Got one Caſk of Water aboard, which reviv'd us exceedingly.</p>

I ask'd them how they came to live in the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s Land. They ſaid there were a great many <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Settlements on this ſide, and gave us an Invitation to their Caravan. We got up behind them, and rode about a Mile to it; where they entertain'd us with good Jurk-Beef, roaſted and boil'd, with good white Bread.

At Four in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon the Governor came to Town; after a ſtrict Enquiry into our Misfortunes, and the reaſons of our coming into this Port, being ſomewhat doubtful that we might be Inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of their Coaſt, he began to examine me, the Lieutenant having reported me to him as Pilot. He aſk'd me if there was a Chart of the Coaſt on Board; and, if not, how it was

               </gap>ld hit the Bar, and venture into ſo hazardous a Place as this is? I told him, as for a Chart, we had none of any kind; but I had a good Obſervation the Day before, that our Veſſel drew but a ſmall Draught of Water; that we kept the Lead always going, and in the Neceſſity we were in, we were oblig'd, at all Events, to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and if we had not ſeen the Opening of the river before Night, we muſt have been compell'd to run the Veſſel aſhore. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd me alſo concerning the Places we ſtopt at, from Cape <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> to this Port, and more particularly relating to the river <hi>Plate.</hi> He was very nice in his Enquiry of our put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in at Cape St. <hi>Mary's,</hi> and of the Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Diſtance along Shore from thence to this Port. When he throughly ſatisfy'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he embraced us, and bleſt himſelf to think of our Deliverance, which he term'd a Miracle. He offer'd every Thing the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try could afford to our relief; the Sick were order'd to be taken Care of in the Hoſpital. He took the Lieutenant and the Land Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers home with him; and deſired the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant to ſee that the reſt of the Officers and People wanted for nothing. Before he went he inform'd us, that his Majeſty's Ships
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:007859_0204_102DDBD5346698B8"/>the <hi>Severn</hi> and <hi>Pearl</hi> were at <hi>Rio Janeiro,</hi> in great Diſtreſs; that they had ſent to <hi>England</hi> for Men, and could not ſail from thence until the Arrival of the <hi>Flota,</hi> which would be in <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June.</hi> He alſo told us, that we ſhould be diſpatch'd in the firſt Veſſel which arriv'd in this Port; for he did not think we could with Safety go any farther in our own; and that there could not be found twelve Seamen in the <hi>Brazils</hi> that would venture over the Bar in her to ſail to <hi>Rio Janeiro;</hi> therefore he order'd our little <hi>Speedwell</hi> aſhore; this Wonder the People are continually flocking to ſee: and it is now about nine Months ſince we were caſt away in the <hi>Wager;</hi> in which Time, I believe, no Mortals have experienc'd more Difficulties and Miſeries than we have. This Day may be juſtly ſtiled the Day of our Deliverance, and ought to be remember'd ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly.</p>

               <hi>Sunday</hi> the 31ſt, Little or nothing remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſince the Day we came in, only a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Change in our Diet; we live on the beſt the Country can produce, and have Plenty of every Thing. This Afternoon the Governor, Commandant, and Commiſſary, came on Board, to ſee our little <hi>Speedwell;</hi> they were ſurpriz'd that thirty Souls, the

I told them he ſat down, and clap'd his Feet againſt the riſe; and ſhow'd them in what Manner we ſecured ourſelves. The Governor, after viewing the Veſſel over, told us, we were more welcome to him in the miſerable Condition we arriv'd, than if we had brought all the Wealth in the World with us. At the ſame Time he fully aſſur'd us, we ſhould be ſupply'd with every Thing that the Country could afford; that he would diſpatch us the firſt Opportunity to <hi>Rio Janeiro;</hi> and whenever we ſtood in Need of any Thing, he order'd us to acquaint the Commandant, and our Wants ſhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ſupply'd. He then took Leave of us, and wiſh'd us well. All the Deference and dutiful reſpect we could ſhow him, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a grateful Senſe of his Favour, was by manning the Veſſel, and giving him three Cheers. The next Day arriv'd at this Place the Brigadier-Governor of the Iſland St. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine;</hi>
               <pb n="174" facs="unknown:007859_0206_102DDBD89AD36A98"/>he came cloſe by our Veſſel, we mann'd her, and gave him three Cheers. The Soldiers of the Garriſon, having twenty Months Arrears due to them, expected the Brigadier was come to pay them; but when they found themſelves diſappointed, they made a great Diſturbance among themſelves. I apply'd to the Commandant for a Houſe, the Veſſel, in rainy Weather, not being fit to lie in; he order'd me one joining to his own, and gave me the Key. I took with me Mr. <hi>Cummins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> Mr. <hi>Snow,</hi> Mr. <hi>Oakley,</hi> and the Cooper; we brought our trifling Neceſſaries on Shore, and remov'd to our new Habitation: Here we were dry and warm; and tho' we had no Bedding, we lodg'd very comfortably. Since the Loſs of the <hi>Wager,</hi> we have been uſed to lie hard; at preſent we think ourſelves very happily fix'd, and heartily wiſh that all the Perſons who ſurviv'd the Loſs of the Ship were in ſo good a Situation as ourſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tueſday, February</hi> the 2d, 1741-2, Great Murmurings among the Soldiers; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the Brigadier from going back as he intended this Morning, till he promis'd to diſpatch the Money, Cloaths, and Proviſions, and to ſee their Grievances adjuſted. On
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:007859_0207_102DDBDB4F9C8178"/>thoſe Terms they have agreed he ſhall go; and this Evening he return'd for St. <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>'s. We apprehended, till now, that the right Officers were in Place; but we find ourſelves miſtaken. Some Time before we arrived here, there was an Inſurrection among the Soldiers: Their Deſign was againſt the Governor; but by his Addreſs, and fair Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of ſeeing them righted, he diverted the Storm from himſelf, and got himſelf conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in his Station; as were alſo the Major and Commiſſary. The Soldiers diſmiſs'd the reſt of the Officers, and ſupply'd their Places with their own People, tho' they were lately private Men; they appear'd very grand, and were not diſtinguiſh'd in Dreſs from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Officers. The Diſturbance at <hi>Rio Grand</hi> is of no Service to us, for we feel the Effects of it; our Allowance is now ſo ſmall that it will hardly ſupport Nature; the People have been without <hi>Farina,</hi> which is their Bread, for ſome Days paſt. We apply'd to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, who promis'd to ſupply us the next Day; accordingly we went for a Supply, which created freſh Murmurings among the Soldiers; however we got a ſmall Quantity of Bread to ſupply us for ten Days. The Store-keeper ſhow'd me all the Proviſions,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:007859_0208_102DDBDD3A8BA008"/>which, conſidering there were a thouſand to draw their Subſiſtence from it, was a ſmall Stock indeed, and not above ſix Weeks at the preſent Allowance. He told me we were ſerv'd equally with the Soldiers; and when more Stores came, which they ſhortly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, our Allowance ſhould be encreas'd. I think, in reaſon, this is as much as we can expect. The Lieutenant not coming nigh us ſince our firſt landing, I went with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple up to him at the Governor's, about two Miles from this Port, to endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with him to get us diſpatch'd, acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him of the Call and Neceſſity there was for our Aſſiſtance on Board the two diſtreſs'd Ships at <hi>Rio Janeiro.</hi> He ſaid he had ſpoke to the Governor, and could not get us diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd till another Veſſel came in. I told him, as the Garriſon were in want of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, what we were living on here, would carry us off; and if any Misfortune ſhould attend the Veſſel expected in with the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, we ſhould be put very hard to it for a Subſiſtence. He promis'd to acquaint the Governor; on which I took my Leave.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> the 17th, This Evening came into this Garriſon three Seamen, giving an Account of their belonging to a Veſſel with
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:007859_0209_102DDBDF30B60050"/>Proviſions and Stores for this Place, from <hi>Rio Janeiro;</hi> that they had been from thence three Months, and had been off the Bar waiting an Opportunity to come in; that not having any freſh Water aboard, they were oblig'd to come to an Anchor ten Leagues to the Southward of this Port; that a Canoe was ſent with thoſe three Men to fill the Water, but the Wind coming in from the Sea, and blowing hard, oblig'd the Veſſel to put to Sea, and leave them aſhore, from whence they travelled here, and believ'd the Veſſel was gone to St. <hi>Catharine</hi>'s. The Governor, not ſatisfy'd with their report, took them for Spies, and kept them as ſuch. However, in a Day or two afterwards, he diſpatch'd a Pilot and two Seamen for the Iſland St. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine,</hi> to bring the Veſſel round, in Caſe ſhe ſhould be there.</p>
            <p>I took this Opportunity of ſending a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by them to the Honourable Capt. <hi>Murray,</hi> Commander of his Majeſty's Ship the <hi>Pearl,</hi> at <hi>Rio Janeiro;</hi> deſiring them to order it to be diſpatch'd by the firſt Ship from St. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine</hi>'s to the <hi>Rio Janeiro.</hi>

               <hi>Saturday</hi> the 20th, Laſt Night the three Seamen which came here, as mention'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, with five more of this Place, attempted to run away with one of the large Boats; but they were purſu'd and taken: Their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign was for the river <hi>Plate,</hi> the Wind then favouring them. This is evident, that the Governor was right in his Conjecture, and did not ſuſpect them wrongfully; they are now Priſoners in the Guard-Houſe. The next Morning I went to the Lieutenant, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring him to apply to the Governor for a Paſs and Horſes for myſelf, Mr. <hi>Cummins,</hi> and <hi>John Young,</hi> to go by Land to St. <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>'s and St. <hi>Franciſco;</hi> where we need not doubt of a Paſſage to his Majeſty's diſtreſs'd Ships at <hi>Rio Janeiro:</hi> That it was our Duty to haſten to their Aſſiſtance: That he, the Lieutenant, ought, the very Day after our Arrival into this Port, without any regard

I aſk'd him, if ſo, how came the Brigadier from St. <hi>Catharine</hi>'s here? And how do Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple weekly go from hence thither? As for Fatigue or Trouble, whoever undertook to go, he muſt expect that; but there was no Hardſhip to be encounter'd comparable to what we had already undergone. We lay here on Expence to the King, without doing any Service, and run the Hazard of not only loſing the Opportunity of getting on Board our own Ships, but perhaps of miſſing the <hi>Flota,</hi> and of wintering here; therefore I beg'd he would entreat the Governor to let us have Horſes and Guides; which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to mention to the Governor at Dinner, and ſend me his Anſwer in the Afternoon without fail. I waited with Impatience for this Anſwer; but the Lieutenant failing in his Promiſe, was the Occaſion of my ſending him this Letter.</p>

The Meaning of which I believe is owing to you, by the endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, through the Perſuaſions of the Perſons you confide in, to blacken us, and in ſo vile a Manner, that you ſeem unacquainted with the ill Conſequence, which may attend the touching a Man's Character.

If I am not miſtaken, you told me that what we were ſupply'd with here, was a Bounty flowing from the

If they ſhould revolt at this Juncture, we ſhall ſtand a very bad Chance. I muſt acquaint you, Sir, the Veſſel we came in, is not ſo much out of repair, but that, if you can get Canvas out of the Store for Sails, we can make 'em, and get ready for ſailing in ten Days Time. And if the Veſſel expected here with Supplies comes in a ſhorter Time, our Veſſel will be ready fix'd for the Uſe of the Governor; and if one Veſſel ſhould not be large enough to carry us all off, we can go in Company. I imagine you know of the Stores being robb'd, and the Diſturbance among the Soldiers, which muſt occaſion Uneaſineſs enough, without repeating Griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, where relief is not to be had. I beg, Sir, you'll get us diſpatch'd with all Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to his Majeſty's Service, that we may not loſe the Opportunity of joining the two Ships and the <hi>Flota.</hi>

               </gap> having been fair for above three Weeks paſt, and little or no Proviſions in Store, which makes them doubtful of any to be diſpatch'd to their relief. This Day we are reſolv'd to go by Land, if the Governor will only allow us a Guide; we acquainted <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Lieutenant with our reſolution; he went with me and Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> to the Governor; we obtain'd Leave to go, with the Promiſe of a Guide. Captain <hi>Pemberton,</hi> being at the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's, deſired to go with us; the Governor told him the Journey was ſo difficult and tedious, it would be impoſſible for him to encounter with it. The Captain anſwer'd, that he had a Company on Board his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty's Ship the <hi>Severn,</hi> where his Duty call'd him, and was determin'd, with the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:007859_0217_102DDBF173A75F98"/>nor's Leave, to ſhare his Fate with us by Land; which was granted. The Governor told us, notwithſtanding the preſent Scarcity of Proviſions in the Place, that he had ſo great a regard for an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> that whilſt he had any thing for himſelf, we ſhould not want; for which we thank'd him heartily. This Governor is certainly a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman of a noble generous Spirit of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Humanity and Goodneſs, and I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve him to have a ſincere regard for an <hi>Engliſhman.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>March</hi> the 9th, This Morning Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> went over with me to the North Side, to make an Agreement for ſix People to go to St. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine</hi>'s; while we were here, the Governor received Letters from St. <hi>Catharine</hi>'s, which gave an Account of four Veſſels on their Paſſage for this Port; on the News of this we put by our Journey: It was very lucky we had not ſet out on this Journey before we heard the News: For on the nineteenth the Veſſels from <hi>Rio Janeiro</hi> arrived, and brought an Account that the <hi>Severn</hi> and <hi>Pearl</hi> were ſail'd from thence for the Iſland of <hi>Barbadoes.</hi> Thoſe Veſſels not only brought the Soldiers Proviſions, but alſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Pardon.</p>

               <pb n="186" facs="unknown:007859_0218_102DDBF402390BC8"/>
On the 20th, The Brigadier arriv'd, and had all the Soldiers drawn up, where their Pardon was read to them: He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted them with what Money was come, which was not above a third Part of their Arrears, but the remainder was on the Paſſage. The Money he had for them ſhould be paid directly as far as it would go, if they would take it; but they cry'd out with one Voice, The Whole or none; and a great Diſturbance there was, ſome were for revolting to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> ſome began to change their Notes, and were for taking Part of the Money, and the reſt inſiſted upon the Whole. To quell this Diſturbance, the Commandant, whom they look'd upon more than the Brigadier, or the Governor, uſed his utmoſt Endeavours. They told the Commandant they were no longer Soldiers than while they were in the King's Pay, and let thoſe who are for the King, draw off one Way by themſelves; you are our Commander, we truſt in you to anſwer for us, what you do we will ſtand by with our Lives: On which the Commandant deliver'd his Command up, ſhouldering his Firelock, and took the Place of a common Soldier, telling
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:007859_0219_102DDBF62C2452D0"/>them, ſince the King was ſo good as to pardon them, he thought it his Duty to accept it; the Brigadier was ſo well pleaſed with the Behaviour of the Commandant, that he ran to him, took him in his Arms, and embraced him; the reſt of the Soldiers follow'd the Example of their late Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant, delivering their reſpective Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands up to their proper Officers. This Day put an End to the Diſturbance and Confuſion which had been ſome Time among them, and reſtor'd them to Tranquility, good Diſcipline, and Order.</p>

               <hi>March</hi> the 22d, This Morning went to the Lieutenant for Leave to go in the firſt Veſſel, which was expected to ſail in four Days time; he told me he expected to go in her himſelf, and that we could not go off all in one Veſſel; there might be room for the Officers, but the People muſt wait another Opportunity. I told him that it was a Duty incumbent on the Officers that were in Pay, particularly, to take Care of the People; you, Sir, have been ſure of half Pay ever ſince the Ship was loſt; we are not, but I will tarry myſelf behind with the People, and be anſwerable for them, if you'll give me a Not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

I left the Lieutenant, and went with Mr. <hi>Cummins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> Mr. <hi>Snow,</hi> Mr. <hi>King,</hi> and Dr. <hi>Oakley</hi> to the Governor, to obtain leave for our going; the Lieutenant follow'd us, and ſaid, but one half could go at a time. The Governor told us it was order'd that the Land Officers, myſelf and the reſt that apply'd to go by Land, ſhould be the firſt diſpatch'd, and might go on board when we would; but as the Veſſel did not belong to the King, we muſt buy Proviſions, and pay for our Paſſage. I ſaid, Sir, we have not Money to anſwer the Expence: He then aſk'd me whether I had not ſeveral Times apply'd to him for Leave to go by Land at my own Charges? I anſwer'd, we were oblig'd to diſpoſe of our Watches to raiſe that Money, which will barely be ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to carry us ſix off that intended to go by Land, therefore what muſt become of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

On my ſaying this, the Governor call'd the Commiſſary and Major; he walk'd and talk'd with them aſide; then came back again, and told us the Account was ſo ſmall, that it was not worth charging the King of <hi>England</hi> with it; therefore we muſt buy our own Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and pay our Paſſage; and as to what we had receiv'd from them, we were wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; upon which we thank'd them, and came away. We then conſulted with the Lieutenant, to know what could be done with the People; and that as the Veſſel we came in was not fit to proceed in any farther, it was to no Purpoſe to leave her there; therefore we deſired his conſent to ſell her, believing the Money ſhe would bring, would be ſufficient to carry us all off. To this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal the Lieutenant conſented. We then apply'd to the Maſter of the Veſſel, to know what he would have for our Paſſage; his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was forty Shillings <hi>per</hi> Man; of which we acquainted the Lieutenant, who told us he could not ſee what we could do, and, on ſecond Conſideration, would not give his Conſent to ſell the Boat; for, when ſold, he did not think ſhe would fetch the Money.
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:007859_0222_102DDBFEB3B70380"/>Thoſe Words of the Lieutenant put us all to a Stand, eſpecially after he had but now given his Conſent to ſell her; and in ſo ſhort Time to declare the reverſe, was very odd; tho' indeed it did not much ſurprize us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this Gentleman was never known to be over ſtedfaſt to his Word. Seeing no Poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of carrying he People off without ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Boat, I told the Lieutenant, if he left them behind, I could not think but ſo many of his Majeſty's Subjects were ſold; and believ'd he had made a Preſent of the Veſſel to the Governor. At this the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant paus'd for a while; and then ſaid, he had not Money to carry himſelf off without ſelling his Coat. I reply'd, there was no Occaſion for that, when he had a Gold Watch. The next Morning went to the Lieutenant again about our going off; he acquainted us, that the Brigadier had order'd Things in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Manner; that myfelf, and nine more, being the Perſons diſirous of going, ſhould be diſpatch'd in the firſt Veſſel, and every Thing found us; that he, the Lieutenant, was to tarry behind with the reſt of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to come in the next Veſſel, an Eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the Charges being made out; and alſo he told us, he had a ſevere Check for

               <hi>Tueſday</hi> the 13th, This Morning we were all order'd before the Governor. A <hi>Dutch</hi> Surgeon was ſent for, who ſpoke very good <hi>Engliſh.</hi> After an Enquiry into our Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, the Governor order'd him to be our Conſul; telling us, that we ſhould have a convenient Houſe, with Firing, and eight Vintins a Man <hi>per</hi> Day Subſiſtence-Money: He alſo deſir'd we might make no Diſturbance among ourſelves; which we promis'd to avoid. A Nobleman went with the Conſul to look out for our Habitation; they fix'd on a large magnificent Houſe, fit for a Perſon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. This being the firſt Day of our coming aſhore, they were pleas'd to order a Dinner,
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:007859_0225_102DDC0543A33A88"/>and Supper out of Doors, and ſent us where we were to eat all together. This was the firſt Time of the Boatſwain's eating with the reſt of the Officers ſince we left <hi>Cheap</hi> Iſland. The Conſul was ſo kind as to ſend us a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Benches, Water Pots, and ſeveral uſeful Things, from his own Houſe; we thought ourſelves very happily ſeated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 14th, This Morning the Conſul went with the Officers and People to the Treaſury for our Money. Mr. <hi>Oakley,</hi> Surgeon of his Majeſty's Land Forces, was deſired by the Conſul to ſign for it. The Boatſwain, who now look'd upon himſelf as our Captain, was not a little diſpleas'd at this. When the Money was received, the Conſul would have given it the Surgeon to pay us; but he excus'd himſelf, telling the Conſul the Boatſwain was a troubleſome Man, and it might occaſion a Diſturbance; on which the Conſul was ſo good as to come and pay it himſelf. Being all together, he told us the Governor had order'd us eight Vintins a Man <hi>per</hi> Day; but at the ſame Time had made a Diſtinction between the Officers and Seamen; that the Money re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived was to be paid in the Manner follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Seamen ſix Vintins <hi>per</hi> Man,
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:007859_0226_102DDC0742193370"/>and the Officers ten. The reaſon of this Diſtinction was, that the Seamen could go to work, and get Money by their Labour; when the Officers could not, but muſt be obliged to live entirely on their Allowance. This Diſtinction cauſed great Uneaſineſs, the Boatſwain inſiſting that the People had a right to an equal Share with us. The Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, willing to make all Things eaſy, deſir'd the Conſul it might be ſo. The Conſul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, the Money ſhould be diſpos'd of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Governor's Direction, or not at all. The Boatſwain then objected againſt the Cooper, becauſe he was no Office<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. The Conſul ſaid, Maſter! I believe the Cooper to be a very good quiet Man, and I dare ſay will take it as the Men do; but ſooner than this be an Objection, I will pay the Money out of my own Pocket. The Boatſwain then began at me, abuſing me in a very ſcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and abominable Manner; ſaying, among other Things; that the Cooper was got among the reſt of the Pirates, for ſo he term'd me and the reſt of the Officers. When the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was paid, we acquainted the Conſul, that we had, till now, been ſeparated from the Boatſwain; that he was of ſo perverſe and turbulent a Temper, and ſo abuſive in Speech,
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:007859_0227_102DDC09B35382D8"/>that we could not bear with him. The Boatſwain then choſe to be with the People, and gave us the Preference of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, where we deſired to be by ourſelves. There were two Doors to our room; we look'd both of them, and went to take a Walk in the Country: At our return in the Evening, we found the Doors broke open, and a ſmall Sword belonging to me was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken an Inch off the Point, and the Scabbard all in Pieces. The Boatſwain had in his room an <hi>Iriſhman,</hi> whom he ſent in on Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe to quarrel with us. This <hi>Iriſhman</hi> and <hi>Richard Eaſt,</hi> one of our own People, fell upon the Cooper and me: <hi>Eaſt</hi> choſe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with me; he ſtruck me ſeveral Times; he compell'd me to ſtand in my own Defence, and I ſoon maſter'd him. During this Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel the Carpenter call'd the Guards; at Sight of whom the <hi>Iriſhman</hi> made his Eſcape. I deſir'd the Guards to ſecure <hi>Eaſt</hi> a Priſoner, but the Officer told me he could not, unleſs I would go to Priſon with him. I told him it was my deſire, and accordingly I went. The Priſon was in the Governor's Houſe. I had not been there but a few Minutes before the Governor ſent for me; he enquired of the Officer concerning the Diſturbance, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:007859_0228_102DDC0C00FB4438"/>me to my Habitation; but detain'd <hi>Eaſt</hi> a Priſoner. When I came Home I found the Boatſwain, and two renegadoes with him, all about the Cooper. On ſeeing me, he repeated his former abuſive Words. He made us ſo uneaſy in our Lodging, that, to prevent Murder, we were oblig'd to lie out of the Houſe. Next Morning Mr. <hi>Oakley</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> went to the Conſul; he came with them to the Houſe, where we were all ſent for; he told us it was very ſtrange, that People who had undergone ſo many Hardſhips and Difficulties, could not agree lovingly together. We anſwer'd, we never us'd to meſs together; and ſooner than we would be with the Boatſwain, we would make it our Choice to take a Houſe in the Country at our own Expence. The Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwain, on hearing this, fell again into his uſual Strain of Slander and abuſive Language, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us rogues, Villains, and Pirates. It was the Governor's firſt requeſt, that we might have no Diſturbance among us; yet the Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwain hath not ſuffer'd us to have a quiet Minute ſince we have been here. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul went with us two Miles out of the City, at a ſiſhing Village; where we took a Houſe, at our own Expence, to pay at the rate of
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:007859_0229_102DDC0DCB752AA0"/>ten Shillings <hi>per</hi> Month, there being ſeven of us in all, <hi>viz.</hi> myſelf, the Carpenter, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, the two Mates, the Cooper, and a Seaman. Here we thought ourſelves ſafe and ſecure. The next Day, in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, two of the Boatſwain's Friends, which had lately deſerted from his Majeſty's Service, and an <hi>Iriſh</hi> Clerk with them, came to pay us a Viſit. They were ſo impertinent, as not only to enquire into the reaſons of the Diſturbance among ourſelves, but they alſo inſtructed us in our Duty, telling us, they came from our Commander the Boatſwain, with Orders to ſee our Journal. I told them the Journal ſhould not be a Secret to any Perſon who could read; but at the ſame Time I would never part with it to be copied out: They then drank a Glaſs of Punch with us and left us. This is a Place that a Man is oblig'd ſometimes to ſuffer himſelf to be uſed ill; if he reſents all Affronts, he runs a great Hazard of loſing his Life; for here ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians are to be hired at a ſmall Expence; and there is no Place in the World where People will commit Murder at ſo cheap a rate. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Nine and Ten at Night, three People, came to our Door; one of which knock'd, telling us that he was the Perſon that was
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:007859_0230_102DDC10314B3F58"/>with me and the Cooper in the Afternoon. Being apprehenſive that they came with no good Intent, we refus'd opening the Door; telling them, that it was an improper Seaſon of the Night, and that we did not know they had any Buſineſs with us; if they had, we told them to come in the Morning: But they ſtill inſiſted upon the Door being open'd; ſaying, it would be better to do ſo, than to be taken away in three Hours Time. When they had ſaid this, they went away. We did not know the Meaning of their Words, but imagin'd they were gone to bring ſome Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates to beſet the Houſe; having nothing to defend ourſelves with, we got over the Back-Wall of the Houſe, and took to the Country for Safety: In the Morning apply'd to the Conſul, who remov'd us to a Houſe in the Midſt of the Village; he gave an Account to the Inhabitants of the Deſign the Boatſwain had form'd againſt us, either to compel us to deliver up the Journal, or to take our Lives; he therefore deſired that the Journal and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers might be depoſited in the Hands of a Neighbour there, till the Time of our going off. The People of the Place offer'd to ſtand by us with their Lives, in Oppoſition to any
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:007859_0231_102DDC12C65B4DD8"/>Perſons who ſhould attempt to do us an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday</hi> the 18th, Early this Morning we were ſent for to the Conſul. He ſaid to us, Gentlemen, as the Lives of three of you are in Danger, and I don't know what Villany your Boatſwain may be capable of acting, in regard to your Peace and Safety; I'll endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to get you three on Board a Ship bound for <hi>Bahia</hi> and <hi>Liſbon;</hi> accordingly he went to the Captain of the Ship, who conſented that we ſhould go with him, on theſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, that the Governor would give us a Paſs, and that we would work for our Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage; this we agreed to: After this we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted the Governor for a Paſs, which he was ſo good as to grant, and is as follows.</p>

               <hi>Wedneſday</hi> the 21ſt, Early this Morning the Captain came on Board; on ſeeing us, he aſk'd us, How we came on Board without his Leave? Notwithſtanding he gave Leave to the Conſul for our Paſſage, we ought to have waited on him aſhore. There was on Board the Ship a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Don, a Paſſenger, who told the Captain no <hi>Engliſhman</hi> ſhould go in the ſame Ship with him; therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired we might be turn'd aſhore; but the Captain inſiſted upon doing what he pleas'd aboard his own Ship, and would not comply with his requeſt. The <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Don, when we came to converſe with him, was very much mov'd with the relation of our Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; and ſaid to us, though our royal Maſters, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> are at War, it was not our Fault; that we were now on Board a Neutral Ship belonging to a King who was a Friend to both Nations;
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:007859_0238_102DDC21AEAE7468"/>that he would not look upon us as Enemies, but do us all the Service he could. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll'd the Conduct and Bravery of Admiral <hi>Vernon</hi> at <hi>Porto-Bello;</hi> but, above all, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded him for his Humanity and generous Treatment of his Enemies. He made great Encomiums on the Magnificence of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Fleet, and the Boldneſs and Imtrepidity of the Sailors, ſtiling the <hi>Engliſh</hi> the <hi>Soldiers of the Sea.</hi> He ſupplied us in our Paſſage not only with Proviſions from his Table, but alſo with Wine and Brandy; and during the whole Voyage appear'd ſo different from an Enemy, that he took all Opportunities of giving us Proofs of his Generoſity and Goodneſs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> the 7th of <hi>May</hi> 1742, This Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anchor'd before the City of <hi>Bahia,</hi> went on Shore to the Vice-roy, ſhew'd him the Paſs we had from the Governor of <hi>Rio Janeiro:</hi> He told us the Paſs was to diſpatch us to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and that the firſt Ship which ſail'd from hence would be the Ship we came in; we petition'd him for Proviſions, acquainting him of our reception at <hi>Rio Grand,</hi> and <hi>Rio Janeiro,</hi> that we had hitherto been ſupply'd at the rate of eight Vintins each Man <hi>per</hi> Day. He refuſed ſupplying us with any Thing; upon which I told him,
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:007859_0239_102DDC2453C2CEB0"/>we had better been Priſoners to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who would allow us Bread and Water, than in a Friend's Country to be ſtarv'd. The Captain of the Ship we came in, hearing the Vice-roy would not ſupply us, was ſo kind as to go with us to him, acquainting him how we were provided for at <hi>Rio Janeiro,</hi> and that he would ſupply us himſelf, if he would ſign an Account to ſatisfy the Conſul General at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> ſo that he might be reimburs'd. The Vice-roy anſwer'd, he had no Orders concerning the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> that he had Letters from the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> his Maſter to ſupply the <hi>French,</hi> but had no Orders about any other Nation, and if he gave us any thing, it muſt be out of his own Pocket, therefore he would not ſupply us; The Captain then told him that we were Officers and Subjects to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and in Diſtreſs; that we did not want great Matters, only barely enough to ſupport Life, and begg'd that he would allow but four Vintins <hi>per</hi> Day, being but half the Sum hitherto allow'd us. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's Intreaties avail'd nothing, the Vice-roy continuing as fix'd in his reſolution of giving us no relief; I don't believe there
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:007859_0240_102DDC25EBC05CF8"/>ever was a worſe repreſentative of royalty upon the Face of the Earth, than this Vice-roy; His royal Maſter the King of <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal</hi> is very well known to have a grateful Affection for the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Nation (nor can we believe he is ſo Frenchify'd as this Vice-roy makes him) his Deputy differs greatly from him, he has given a Proof of his Aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the <hi>Engliſh.</hi> We think Perſons in the Diſtreſs we were repreſented in to him, could in no Part of the World, nay in an Enemy's Country, be treated with more Barbarity than we were here; We work'd here for our Victuals, and then could get but one Meal <hi>per</hi> Day, which was Farina and Caravances. At this Place we muſt have ſtarv'd, if I had not by me ſome Mon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Money fourteen Guineas, which I exchang'd with the Captain who brought us here for <hi>Portugueze</hi> Money; He at the ſame time told me it would be hard upon me to be ſo much out of Pocket, and ſaid if I would draw a Bill on the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſul General at <hi>Lisbon</hi> for the Sum, as if ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd from him, upon the Payment of that
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:007859_0241_102DDC278C0AAFF8"/>Bill, he would return me my fourteen Gui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neas, accordingly a Bill was drawn up by an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Merchant at <hi>Bahia,</hi> and ſign'd by us, being as follows:</p>

            <p>Since our being here, we have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd of one of his Majeſty's Ships with three Store-Ships being arriv'd at <hi>Rio Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neiro,</hi> ſupply'd with Stores and Men for the relief and Aſſiſtance of the <hi>Severn</hi> and <hi>Pearl</hi> (which were ſail'd before in <hi>January</hi> laſt for <hi>Barbadoes)</hi> and that our People were
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:007859_0244_102DDC2E23184C78"/>gone on board of them, and bound for the <hi>Weſt-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here is a very good Bay for Ships to ride in, with the Wind from the E. S. E. to the Northward and Weſtward back to the S. W. and Wind to the Southward, which blows in, and makes a very great Sea. At the Eaſt Side coming in, ſtandeth <hi>Point de Gloria,</hi> where is a very large Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, with a Tower in the midſt; from this Point the Land riſes gradually; about a League from hence is the City of <hi>Bahia;</hi> it is ſurrounded with Fortifications and equally capable of defending it againſt any Attempts from the Sea or Lands.</p>
            <p>Proviſions her of all kinds are exceſſive dear, eſpecially Fiſh, this we impute to the great Number of Whales that come into this Bay, even where the Ships lie at Anchor; the Whale Boats go off and kill ſometimes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>even or eight Whales in a Day. The Fleſh of which is out up in ſmall Pieces, then brought to the Market Place, and ſold at the rate of a Vintin <hi>per</hi> Pound; it looks very much like coarſe Beef, but inferior to it in Taſte. The Whales here are not at all equal in Size to the Whales in <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being not larger than the Grampus.
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:007859_0245_102DDC2FCDE7F3A8"/>After living here above four Months with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any relief from the Governor or the Inhabitants, who behaved to us as if they were under a Combination to ſtarve us, we embark'd on board the St. <hi>Tubes</hi> with our good Friend the Captain who brought us from <hi>Rio Janeiro;</hi> we ſail'd from <hi>Bahia</hi> the 11th of <hi>September</hi> for <hi>Lisbon,</hi> in Company with one of the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s Ships of War, and two <hi>Eaſt-India</hi> Ships; but the St. <hi>Tubas</hi> not being able to ſail ſo well as the other Ships, loſt ſight of them the firſt Night. About 70 Leagues from the Weſtward of <hi>Madeira,</hi> we bent a new Foreſail; within two or three Days afterwards, we had a very hard Gale of Wind, ſcudding under the Foreſail, and no Danger happening to the Ship during this Gale. When the Wind had ceas'd, and we had fair Weather, the Captain, after the Evening Maſs, made an Oration to the People, telling them that their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from Danger in the laſt Gale of Wind, and that the Ship though leaky mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more Water than before, was owing to their Prayers to <hi>Nueſtra Senhora Boa Mortua</hi> and her Interceſſion. That in Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude they ought to make an Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to that Saint for ſtanding their Friend
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:007859_0246_102DDC31E14DF0A0"/>in time of Need. That he himſelf would ſhew the Example by giving the new Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail, which was bent to the Yard, to the Saint their Deliverer; accordingly one of the Seamen went forward and mark'd out theſe Words on the Sail, <hi>Deal eſta Trinckado pour noſtra Senhora Boa mortua</hi> (which is as much as to ſay) <hi>I give this Foreſail to our Saint the Deliverer from Death.</hi> The Sail and Money collected on this Occaſion amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to upwards of twenty Moidores.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the 23d of <hi>November,</hi> in the Latitude 39: 17 North, and Longitude 6: 00 W. that Day at Noon the <hi>Rock</hi> of <hi>Liſbon</hi> bearing S. by W. diſtant ſixteen Leagues; we ſteer'd E. S. E. to make the <hi>Rock</hi> before Night. At Four o'Clock it blew a very hard Gale, and right on the Shore; the Ship lay to under a Foreſail with her Head to the Southward; at Six it blew a Storm, the Foreſail ſplitting, oblig'd us to keep her before the Wind, which was running her right on the Shore. The Ship was now given over for loſt, the People all fell to Prayers, and cry'd out to their Saints for Deliverance, offering all they had in the World for their Lives; and yet at the ſame time neglected all Means to ſave themſelves;
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:007859_0247_102DDC34A34480E0"/>they left off pumping the Ship, though ſhe was exceeding leaky. This Sort of Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in time of Extremity is a thing unknown to our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Seamen; in thoſe Emergencies all Hands are employ'd for the Preſervation of the Ship and People, and, if any of them fall upon their Knees, 'tis after the Danger is over. The Carpenter and myſelf could by no Means reliſh this Behaviour, we begg'd the People for God's ſake to go to the Pumps, telling them we had a Chance of ſaving our Lives, while we kept the Ship above Water, that we ought not to ſuffer the Ship to ſink, while we could keep her free. The Captain and Officers hearing us preſſing them ſo earneſtly, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>t off Prayers, and intreated the Men to keep the Pumps going, accordingly we went to pumping, and preſerv'd our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and the Ship: In half an Hour after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Wind ſhifted to the W. N. W. then the Ship lay South, which would clear the Courſe along Shore had the Wind not ſhifted; we muſt in an Hour's time have run the Ship a-ſhore. This Deliverance, as well as the Former, was owing to the Interceſſion of <hi>Nueſtra Senhora Boa Mortua:</hi> On this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion they collected Fifty Moidores more, and made this pious reſolution, that, when
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:007859_0248_102DDC3694BA9078"/>the Ship arriv'd ſafe at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſail, which was ſplit in the laſt Gale of Wind, ſhould be carried in Proceſſion to the Church of this grand Saint, and the Captain ſhould there make an Offering equal in Value to the Foreſail, which was reckon'd worth eighteen Moidores.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> the 28th of <hi>November,</hi> we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Lisbon;</hi> and on the next Morning every Perſon who came in the Ship, (except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Carpenter, myſelf; and the Cooper) Officers, Paſſengers, the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Don himſelf, and all the People, Men and Boys, walk'd bare-footed, with the Fore-ſail in Proceſſion, to the Church of <hi>Nueſtra Senhora Boa Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua;</hi> the Weather at that Time being very cold, and the Church a good Mile diſtant from the Landing-Place. We <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> when we came aſhore, went immediately on the <hi>Change.</hi> I was pretty well known to ſome Gentlemen of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Factory. When I inform'd them that we were three of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate People that were caſt away in the <hi>Wager,</hi> and that we came here in one of the <hi>Brazil</hi> Ships, and wanted to embrace the firſt Opportunity of going to <hi>England;</hi> they told me, that the Lieutenant had been before us; that he was gone home in the Packet Boat,
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:007859_0249_102DDC388BD93FB8"/>and left us a very indifferent Character. I anſwer'd, I believ'd the Lieutenant could give but a very bad Account of himſelf, having kept no Journal, nor made any remarks ſince the Loſs of the Ship, nor perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; that we doubted not but to acquit our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of any falſe Accuſations, having with us a Journal, which gave an impartial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of all our Proceedings. The Journal was read by ſeveral Gentlemen of the Facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who treated us, during our Stay at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> with exceeding Kindneſs and Benevolence.</p>
            <p>On the 20th of <hi>December,</hi> we embark'd on Board his Majeſty's Ship the <hi>Stirling-Caſtle</hi> for <hi>England:</hi> Here we had again the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of experiencing the Difference between a <hi>Britiſh</hi> and a Foreign Ship, particularly in regard to Cleanlineſs, Accomodation, Diet and Diſcipline. We met with nothing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial in our Paſſage, and arrived at <hi>Spithead</hi> on the 1ſt of <hi>January,</hi> 1742-3. Here we thought of nothing but going aſhore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to our Families; but were told by the Captain, we muſt not ſtir out of the Ship till he knew the Pleaſure of the Lords of the Admiralty, having already wrote to them con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>rning us. This was a very great Affliction to us; and the more ſo becauſe
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:007859_0250_102DDC3AA7EC42B8"/>we thought our Troubles at an End. The Carpenter and myſelf were in View of our Habitations; our Families had long given us over for loſt; and, on the News of our Safety, our relatives look'd upon us as Sons, Huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and Fathers, reſtor'd to them in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Manner. Our being detain'd on Board gave them great Anxiety; we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to conſole 'em as well as we could; being aſſured, that we had done nothing to offend their Lordſhips; that, if Things were not carried on with that Order and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which is ſtrictly obſerv'd in the Navy, Neceſſity drove us out of the common road. Our Caſe was ſingular: Since the loſs of the Ship, our chiefeſt Concern was for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation of our Lives and Liberties; to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh which we acted according to the Dictates of Nature, and the beſt of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding.</p>

            <p>I received for Anſwer by one of the Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſengers, <q>That the Journal was our own, and that their Lordſhips would have nothing to do with it, ſo you may do as you will with it.</q> I thought this Anſwer was Leave ſufficient, on which I went to publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Journal, which ſome People in the World have condemned me for; had I not wrote to their Lordſhips for Leave, they might have blamed me. After publiſhing the Work, we were told by many, that we were to be hang'd for Piracy in coming away with the King's Long-boat without the Capt. and alſo for mutinying, and not bringing him home with us. There was one great good Man that gave his Judgment in our Favour, ſo far as to ſay, She was not the King's Long-boat; giving theſe reaſons: At the firſt
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:007859_0255_102DDC46438682F8"/>wrecking of the <hi>Wager,</hi> they cut their Maſts away, which rendered them incapable of hoiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her out; but ſome Time after the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain gave Orders to his Officers and People to go off to the Wreck and bring the Long-boat on Shore. They obey his Orders, go off to the Wreck, ſaw the Gunnel down, launch the Boat, and bring her on Shore; when there, the Captain orders her to be haul'd up at a proper Place for lengthning; his Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders are obey'd; after which he orders the Carpenter to ſaw her aſunder; the Carpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter goes to work, obeys the Captain's Orders; now, it is to be obſerved, that the Long-boat is in two Parts, and by Capt. <hi>Cheap</hi>'s Orders; by which Orders, he has not only made her uſeleſs to the whole Body of the People on the Iſland, but as uſeleſs to himſelf as the Wreck in the Sea, and by his own Orders: But the Carpenter, with the Aſſiſtance of the People, have gone into the Woods, out their own Timber, ſaw'<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. I am farther to obſerve, that at that Time, when the King's Ship was loſt, that the Pay ceaſed, and it might as well have been told them that they had no right to take up any Part of the Wreck of his Majeſty's Ship that float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

This I leave to the Candid to judge, which were the greateſt Mutineers of the two?</p>
            <p>About two Years after the Journal was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, I had an Offer made me by ſome Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of the City of <hi>London,</hi> to go down to <hi>Plymouth</hi> in Order to bring up to <hi>London</hi> the old <hi>Saphire</hi> man of War, a forty Gun Ship, purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed by thoſe Gentlemen for a privateer: This was the firſt offer made of getting into Bread ſince my Arrival in <hi>England</hi> which I thought it my Duty to accept; the ſame Duty bound me

After receiving the above, I proceeded for <hi>Plymouth,</hi> there took charge and fix'd the Ship with Jury Maſts, muſter'd forty Men, and ten Guns. In the middle of July ſail'd in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with three Sail bound for <hi>London,</hi> the Maſters whereof engaged with me not to Part Company, being doubtful of falling in with two French Dogger Privateers, which had done a great Deal of Miſchief in the Channel. The next Morning about Six o'Clock, it being little Wind, the <hi>Starts</hi> bearing N.N.W. ſaw the two Privateers in chaſe of three Ships to the S. in about two Hours after they left off their Chace, and haul'd their Wind, in order to ſpeak with us; at which the three Sail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within me, haul'd their Wind in order to run their Veſſels on ſhore: on this I bore down to the Privateers, run the ten Guns out of the ſtarboard Side, and as ſoon as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Gun ſhot hoiſted the King's Colours and fired a Shot, which they did not regard, by not hoiſting any Colours; at which I ordered the Men below to get all ready at once to haul all the lower Deck Ports up, by doing which we'll give them to believe we are in a Man of War, and by having Jury Maſts, will think that we loſt them in an Engagement or bad Weather; as ſoon as they acquainted me
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:007859_0260_102DDC510EB6FF90"/>they were ready, I order'd them to haul up, and fired another Shot, which had the deſired Effect, for they inſtantly hoiſted <hi>Swediſh</hi> Colours, and tack'd from us; by which Scheme ſix Sail of Merchant Veſſels were ſaved from being taken; the Privateers had each a Hundred and Seventeen Men on Board. To the Fact of this I refer to the St. James's Evening Poſt, it being publiſhed there. In about ten Months after this Captain Cheap arrived in <hi>England</hi> from <hi>France:</hi> The Account he gave of his Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the Perils and Dangers he went thro' after he was left by us, is as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN the Long-boat and Cutter were gone, the Captain, and thoſe who were left with him, propoſed to paſs to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the Barge and Yawl; But the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was ſo bad, and the Difficulty of ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting ſo great, that it was two Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Departure of the Long-boat before he was able to put to Sea. But as it has been already ſaid, the Place where the <hi>Wager</hi> was caſt away, was not a Part of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, but an Iſland at ſome ſome diſtance from the Main, which afforded no other Sorts of Proviſion but Shell-fiſh, and a few Herbs; and as the greateſt Part of what they had
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:007859_0261_102DDC52FAE30320"/>gotten from the Ship was carried off in the Long-boat, the Captain and his People were often in great Neceſſity, eſpecially as they choſe to preſerve what little Sea-proviſions remained, for their Store when they ſhould go to the Northward. During their reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at this Iſland, which was by the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men denominated <hi>Wager's Iſland,</hi> they had now and then a ſtraggtling Canoe or two of <hi>Indians,</hi> which came and bartered their Fiſh and other Proviſions with our People. This was indeed ſome little Succour, and at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Seaſon might perhaps have been great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for as there were ſeveral <hi>Indian</hi> Huts on the Shore, it was ſuppoſed that in ſome Years, during the height of Summer, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe Savages might reſort thither to fiſh.</p>
            <p>Upon the 14th of <hi>December,</hi> the Captain and his People embarked in the Barge and the Yawl, in order to proceed to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, taking on board with them all the Proviſions they could amaſs from the Wreck of the Ship; but they had ſcarcely been an Hour at Sea, when the Wind began to blow hard, and the Sea ran ſo high, that they were obliged to throw the greateſt Part of their Proviſions over-board, to avoid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:007859_0262_102DDC54E22CE2D8"/>Deſtruction. This was a terrible Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, in a Part of the World where Food is ſo hard to be got: However, they ſtill perſiſted in their Deſign, putting on Shore as often as they could to ſeek Subſiſtance. But about a Fortnight after, another dreadful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident befel them, for the Yawl ſunk at an Anchor, and one of the Men in her was drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and as the Barge was incapable of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the whole Company, they were now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the hard Neceſſity of leaving four Marines behind them on that deſolate Shore. But they ſtill kept on their Courſe to the Northward, ſtruggling with their Diſaſters, and greatly delayed by the Perverſeneſs of the Winds, and the frequent Interruptions which their Search after Food occaſioned; Till at laſt, about the End of <hi>January,</hi> having made three unſucceſsful Attempts to double a Head-land, which they ſuppoſed to be what the <hi>Spaniards</hi> called Cape <hi>Tres Montes,</hi> it was unanimouſly reſolved to give over this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the Difficulties of which appeared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuperable, and to return again to <hi>Wager Iſland,</hi> where they got back about the Middle of <hi>February,</hi> quite diſheartned and dejected with their reiterated Diſappointments, and almoſt periſhing with Hunger and Fatigue.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="231" facs="unknown:007859_0263_102DDC56C3967500"/>
However, on their return they had the good Luck to meet with ſeveral Pieces of Beef, which had been waſhed out of the Ship, and were ſwimming in the Sea. This was a moſt ſeaſonable relief to them, after the Hardſhips they had endured: And to compleat their good Fortune, there came, in a ſhort Time, two Canoes of <hi>Indians,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt which was a Native of <hi>Chiloe,</hi> who ſpoke a little <hi>Spaniſh;</hi> and the Surgeon, who was with Captain <hi>Cheap,</hi> underſtanding that Language, he made a Bargain with the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> that if he would carry the Captain and his People to <hi>Chiloe</hi> in the Barge, he ſhould have her, and all that belonged to her for his Pains. Accordingly, on the 6th of <hi>March,</hi> the eleven Perſons to which the Company was now reduced, embark'd in the Barge on this new Expedition; but after having proceeded for a few Days, the Captain and four of his principal Officers being on Shore, the Six, who together with an <hi>Indian</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Barge, put off with her to Sea, and did not return.</p>
            <p>By this Means there were left on Shore Captain <hi>Cheap,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Lieutenant of Marines, the Honourable Mr. <hi>Byron,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Campbel,</hi> Midſhipmen, and Mr. <hi>Elliot,</hi> the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon.
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:007859_0264_102DDC590C4BE748"/>One would have thought their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes had long before this Time been inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Augmentation; but they found, on reflection, that their preſent Situation was much more diſmaying than any Thing they had yet gone through, being left on a deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Coaſt, without any Proviſion, or the Means of procuring any; for their Arms, Ammunition, and every Conveniency they were Maſters of, except the tattered Habits they had on, were all carried away in the Barge.</p>
            <p>But when they had ſufficiently revolved in their own Minds the various Circumſtances of this unexpected Calamity, and were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaded that they had no relief to hope for, they perceived a Canoe at a Diſtance, which proved to be that of the <hi>Indian,</hi> who had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to carry them to <hi>Chiloe,</hi> he and his Family being then on Board it. He made no Difficulty of coming to them; for it ſeems he had left Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> and his People a little before to go a fiſhing, and had in the mean Time committed them to the Care of the other <hi>Indian,</hi> whom the Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors had carried to Sea in the Barge. But when he found the Barge gone and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion miſſing, he was extreamly concerned,
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:007859_0265_102DDC5B2BFFCB40"/>and could with Difficulty be perſwaded that the other <hi>Indian</hi> was not murdered; but, being at laſt ſatisfied with the Account that was given him, he ſtill undertook to carry them to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Settlements, and (as the <hi>Indians</hi> are well ſkilled in fiſhing and fowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) to procure them Proviſions by the Way.</p>
            <p>About the middle of <hi>March</hi> Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> and the Four that were left with him, ſet out for <hi>Chiloe,</hi> the <hi>Indian</hi> having procured a Number of Canoes, and gotten many of his Neighbours together for that Purpoſe. Soon after they embarked, Mr <hi>Elliot</hi> the Surgeon died, ſo that there now remained only Four of the whole Company. At laſt, after a very complicated Paſſage by Land and Water, Captain <hi>Cheap,</hi> Mr. <hi>Byron,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Campbel,</hi> arrived in the Beginning of <hi>June</hi> at the Iſland of <hi>Chiloe,</hi> where they were received by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with great Humanity; but, on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ſome Quarrel among the <hi>Indians,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> did not get there till two Months after. Thus, above a Twelvemonth after the Loſs of the <hi>Wager</hi> ended this fatiguing Peregrination, which by a Variety of Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes diminiſhed the Company from Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to no more than Four, and thoſe too brought ſo low, that, had their Diſtreſſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb n="334" facs="unknown:007859_0266_102DDC5D35DA9348"/>but a few Days longer, in all Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility none of them would have ſurvive<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. For the Captain himſelf was with Difficulty recovered; and the reſt were ſo reduced by the Severity of the Weather, their Labour, and their Want of all kinds of Neceſſaries, that it was wonderful how they ſupported themſelves ſo long. After ſome Stay at <hi>Chiloe,</hi> the Captain and the Three who were ſent to <hi>Valparaiſo,</hi> and thence to St. <hi>Jago,</hi> the Capital of <hi>Chili,</hi> where they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued above a Year: But on the Advice of a Cartel being ſettled betwixt <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> Captain <hi>Cheap,</hi> Mr. <hi>Byron,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> were permitted to return to <hi>Europe</hi> on board a <hi>French</hi> Ship. The other Midſhipman, Mr. <hi>Campbel,</hi> having changed his religion, whilſt at St. <hi>Jago,</hi> choſe to go back to <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi> with <hi>Pizarro</hi> and his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, with whom he went afterwards to <hi>Spain</hi> on board the <hi>Aſia;</hi> and there having failed in his Endeavours to procure a Commiſſion from the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> he returned to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and attempted to get reinſtated in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Navy; and has ſince publiſhed a Narration of his Adventures, in which he complains of the Injuſtice that had been done him, and ſtrongly diſavows his ever being in
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:007859_0267_102DDC5EF29DB3E0"/>the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Service: But as the Change of his religion, and his offering himſelf to the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> (though not accepted) are Matters which, he is conſcious, are capable of being inconteſtably proved; on theſe two Heads, he has been entirely ſilent."</p>
            <p>After Capt. <hi>Cheap</hi>'s Arrival as above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, on reading an Advertiſement in the News-Paper, I found there was an Order for all the Officers and People of the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> that were in <hi>England</hi> to repair on board Admiral <hi>Steward,</hi> in order to give their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions in for a Court-Martial, to be held concerning the Loſs of his Majeſty's Ship the <hi>Wager.</hi> I being then in <hi>London,</hi> ſent into their Lordſhips to acquaint them that on reading the Advertiſement, I was going to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> in order to comply with their Directions. I was anſwer'd by one of the Meſſengers, it was very well. The next Day being on the <hi>Royal-Exchange,</hi> a Gentleman which was one of the Procters of <hi>Doctors-Commons,</hi> aſk'd me what News now our Captain was come home? I told him I was going to <hi>Portſmouth</hi> to the Court-Martial: He then aſk'd me if I knew nothing more than the Advertiſement for the Court-Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial?

<pb n="236" facs="unknown:007859_0268_102DDC61B24F41D8"/>that the <hi>Monday</hi> before the Advertiſement was publiſhed, there were four Meſſengers diſpatch'd from the Marſhal of the Admiralty, in order to take up the Lieutenant, Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwain, Myſelf and Carpenter. On this I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, if that is Fact, I will go and deliver my ſelf up to the Marſhal here in Town; finding me <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And is a Murderer at laſt come Home to be their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſer? I have carefully peruſed the Journal, and can't conceive that they have been guilty of Piracy, Mutiny, not any Thing elſe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve it.

<pb n="237" facs="unknown:007859_0269_102DDC6363782B70"/>have been guilty of ſuch Things to Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> whilſt a Priſoner, that I believe the Gunner and Carpenter will be hang'd, if no Body elſe. As I was not known to him, on theſe Words, I told him, then I was one of the Men that muſt ſuffer, for that I was the unfortunate Gunner of the <hi>Wager:</hi> After he was convinced, he told me, I was then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Priſoner; he had me to his Houſe, where I was confined until the reſt of the Officers were brought up to Town, which, as ſoon as they came up, he wrote to their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips to inform them, that he had us all in Cuſtody; but that I had delivered my ſelf up to him here in Town; deſiring their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips farther Directions concerning us. The Anſwer received was, to ſend us to <hi>Portſmouth</hi> and there to deliver us up on Board Admiral <hi>Steward,</hi> to take a receipt, and to take parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Care that the Gunner and Carpenter did not make their eſcape. After on Board of Admiral <hi>Steward,</hi> we were told we were to be hang'd, nay, not a Letter came from any of our Friends, but there were theſe Words mentioned, <hi>you are to be hang'd!</hi> When the Captain came down to <hi>Portſmouth,</hi> ſome of my Friends waited on him, deſiring to know what he had to alledge againſt us? His Anſwer was, <hi>Gentlemen, I have nothing to ſay for nor
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:007859_0270_102DC70920A1B2E0"/>againſt the Villains, until the Day of Tryal, and then it is not in my Power to be off from hang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</hi> This Expreſſion occaſioned the whole Place to believe it would be ſo. On the <hi>Sunday</hi> following we were had up <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>o Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, where there was a great Congregation, the Text was taken out of the Pſalms, <hi>Them that go down to the Deep, and occupy their Buſineſs in great Waters,</hi> ſee the Works of the Lord.</p>
            <p>In the Latter Part of this Sermon, theſe Words were apply'd; <q>Men ſhould not feed themſelves up in vain Notions or Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a reprieve or Pardon, for how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten are Men deceived even at their laſt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? And Men that have ſeen ſo many Providences of the Divine Being, it's not to be doubted but they are prepared, &amp;c.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Hearing this Sermon gave us ſome reaſon to think, that we were to fall by the Violence of Power, contrary to the Laws of our Country. In the Evening of the ſame Day we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Maſter and Gunner of the ſaid Ship, that a certain Gentleman had ſent Word that we might have the Privilege of Pen, Ink and Paper until the Day of Tryal, which was to be on the <hi>Tueſday</hi> following, and that he had made a reſolution, that no Man after Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:007859_0271_102DDC65ED79FBA8"/>of Death ſhould be indulged with it on any Account.</p>
            <p>All this we imagined was done on purpoſe to intimidate us, to retract from the Truth which was publiſhed to the World: But our great, good and juſt God ſupported and ſtrengthened our Faith to bear with theſe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſults from Men. The next Day in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing came on Board the Judge Advocate, in order to take our Depoſitions for Trayl. When I was ſent for, I was aſked for a Depoſition concerning the Loſs, of His Majeſty's Ship the <hi>Wager;</hi> I made Anſwer, Sir, I am ſurpriſed that you ſhould offer to aſk me for a Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition whilſt a Priſoner. Sir, this is not the firſt, but the ſecond Time to your Knowledge, that I have been confined on this very Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I always thought, or at leaſt the Laws of my Country tell me, that when a Man is a Priſoner, he muſt be accuſed; and I take my Accuſer to be Captain <hi>Cheap,</hi> expecting you was come here on purpoſe to have given me his Charge, to prepare myſelf for Tryal againſt him. The Marſhal's Anſwer was, <hi>Sir, this Court-Martial is only to know how the Ship was loſt, therefore you muſt give me your Depoſition in Regard to it.</hi> I anſwered, Sir, that is made mention of in a very particular Manner in the
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:007859_0272_102DDC686954FE60"/>Journal that is publiſhed, and by the Truth of which Book I ſtand or fall. He made Anſwer, <hi>Sir, that does not avail, you muſt give it us from under your own Hand Writing,</hi> I reply'd, if I do, Sir, I muſt take it from the Journal; which I did. The next Day came on the Tryal, where Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> alledged the Loſs of the Ship on Lieutenant <hi>Robert Beans</hi> by not ſetting the Main-top-ſail, and letting go the Anchor, according to his Orders. However it was proved by ſome of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers there, the Impoſſibility of it. After being examined about the Loſs of the Ship, was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd by the Court to withdraw; ſome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was order'd into Court again, where was read, <hi>We do Honourably acquit Captain</hi> David Cheap, <hi>with the Reſt of his Officers, from the Loſs of His Majeſty's Ship the</hi> Wager, <hi>excepting Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant</hi> Robert Beans, <hi>who has diſobey'd his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's Orders, by not ſetting the Main-top-ſail, and letting go the Anchor, as ordered; however, in Regard to his Hardſhips and Misfortunes, do alſo acquit him with a Reprimand from the Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Day's Proceedings we beheld the great and glorious Power of the Almighty, in plead-our Cauſe, and defending us from falling by the Violence of Men. In about a Week's time after, I went to <hi>London,</hi> and writ unto their
<pb n="241" facs="unknown:007859_0273_102DDC6B050C1570"/>Lordſhips for Wages, receiving no Anſwer, apply'd to ſome of their Lordſhips in Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, one of which was pleaſed to aſk me if I was not one of the Men that publiſhed the Book? I made Anſwer, I was; to this he replyed, <q>How dare you preſume to touch a Gentleman's Character in ſo publick a Manner as you have done? Do you think that Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> has nothing to ſay in Vindication of his Character? He will no doubt call you to an Account for it: We have not heard as yet, what he has to Charge you with, therefore no Wages, nor any Thing elſe can be done for you, unleſs a Hearing from him.</q> I made Anſwer, My Lord, I was honourably acquitted with him, and the Book that is publiſhed has put it out of the Power of Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge any Thing againſt us. His Lordſhip anſwer'd, <hi>I wiſh you may clear your Point in it.</hi>

            <p>I take this Opportunity, to recommend to the candid reader, the peruſal of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Book, entitled, <hi>The Chriſtian Patern, or, The Imitation of Jeſus Chriſt, by Thomas a Kempis;</hi> which Book I brought with me through the various Scenes, Changes, and Chances of the Voyage, and Providence made it, the Means of comforting me.

            <p>Shortly after receiving the Wages for the <hi>Wager,</hi> I was made Maſter of the <hi>Royal George</hi> Cutter, employed in his Majeſty's Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.

            <p>Notwithſtanding my thus being appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Command of the ſaid Cutter, yet, I afterwards, upon maturely conſidering it, declined the Service; ſhe being too ſmall to bear the Sea; which was verify'd in her Cruiſe, for ſhe founder'd in the Bay of <hi>Biſcay,</hi> and every Man in her was drowned.</p>
            <p>About this Time arrived in <hi>England Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Cooper, John Andrews,</hi> and <hi>Iſaac Morris,</hi> three of the Men left on the Coaſt of <hi>Pata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gonia,</hi> as mentioned <hi>Page</hi> 160 the Narrative they gave of their Sufferings, is as follows:</p>
            <q>A <hi>NARRATIVE</hi> of the Diſtreſſes, &amp;c. of Eight of the Crew of the Long Boat, who were left on Shore by the Lieutenant of the <hi>Wager</hi> on an uninhabited Part of <hi>Patagonia,</hi> mentioned in this Book, <hi>Page 160,</hi> and taken from the Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of <hi>Iſaac Morris</hi> (one of the Men) who arrived in <hi>England,</hi> July, <hi>1746.</hi>
            </q>
            <p>ON the 14th of <hi>January,</hi> 1741-2, the Wind blew hard at E. S. E. and we ſaw our Veſſel ſtretching further off, and ſoon after we received, in a ſcuttled Caſk, a few Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries,
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:007859_0277_102DDC75AF29DE28"/>with Ammunition, and a Letter <note n="*" place="bottom">See <hi>p. 162,</hi> for the Reaſons for leaving theſe unhappy Men aſhore.</note>to acquaint us of the riſque they ſhould run in lying near the Shore, and that they were obliged to ſtand farther off for their own Safety till the Weather ſhould be more fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable. Next Morning we expected they would have ſtretch'd in for the Land; but, to our great Surprize, we ſaw the Schooner with her Enſign hoiſted at the Topping-lift, and under Sail from us.</p>
            <p>The diſmal Apprehenſion we were under at ſuch an unexpected Stroke, appeared plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our Countenances, and are much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſier to be imagin'd than deſcribed. We found ourſelves on a wild deſolate Part of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> World, fatigued, ſickly, and deſtitute of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions. 'Tis true we had Arms and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and, whilſt that laſted, made a toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Shift for a Livelihood. The neareſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited Place we knew of was <hi>Buenos-Ayres,</hi> about three hundred Miles to the N. W. but at preſent we were in a very poor Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to undertake ſuch an hazardous Journey, being ſo miſerably reduced by our tedious Paſſage thro' the <hi>Streights of Magellan.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remained but to commit ourſelves to
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:007859_0278_102DDC77B3CB9908"/>kind Providence, and make the beſt of our melancholy Situation, till we had recruited ourſelves.</p>
            <p>We were in Number eight who were thus abandoned by our Crew, for whoſe Preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we riſqued our Lives, in ſwimming aſhore for Proviſions. Our Names were <hi>Guy Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, Samuel Cooper, Benjamin Smith, John Duck, Joſ. Clinch, John Andrews, John Allen,</hi> and myſelf. After deliberating upon our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Circumſtances, and comforting each other with imaginary Hopes, we came to a reſolution of taking up our Quarters on the Beach where we landed, till we ſhould grow ſtrong enough to undergo the Fatigue of a Journey to <hi>Buenos-Ayres.</hi> The Weather being very favourable, we took up our Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Trench near the Sea-ſide, quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, without any Covering but the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. Here we ſtay'd about a Month, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which Time we lived upon Seal, which were very plenty, and which we knocked down with Stones after we had cut off their retreat, by getting between them and the Sea. Here was likewiſe plenty of freſh Water, from a ſmall Spring which roſe out of the Trench; ſo that, at the Month's End, we had pretty well recover'd ourſelves, and
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:007859_0279_102DDC798E579D98"/>concluded upon laying in a Stock of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for our Journey to <hi>Buenos-Ayres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having provided ourſelves each with a Knapſack, which we made of Seal-ſkin, in the beſt Manner we could, we put into it as much dried Seal as we could carry, and their Bladders we filled with Freſh Water, which ſerved us for Bottles. We took our Muſkets and Ammunition with us, and, thus accoutred, we ſet out on our Journey about the Middle of <hi>February;</hi> and, that we might proceed with the more Certainty, we were determined to keep cloſe to the Sea-ſide till we ſhould come to the Mouth of the <hi>River Plate.</hi> The firſt two Days we travelled about ſixty Miles, but could meet with no freſh Water, beſides what we brought with us, the Country being ſcorch'd with Drought, and the rains not yet ſet in. Our Water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near expended, we were afraid to proceed, leſt we ſhould periſh for want of more; ſo, after a few Debates, we agreed to return back to our old Quarters, and wait till the rainy Seaſon. We were two Days and a half on our return, after which we employ'd ourſelves in building a Sort of Hut under a Cliff adjoining the Sea-ſide, to ſecure us from the Inclemencies of the Weather. Here we tarried three Months, during which Time
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:007859_0280_102DDC7BCF1F9500"/>our Food was Seals and Armadillos, which was the only Proviſion to be met with here, except Sea-weed, which we ſometimes made uſe of with our Meat inſtead of Bread. The Seal here differ from thoſe which I have ſeen in other Parts, both in Size and Make. The Males are the Bigneſs of a good Calf; their Neck is ſhaggy; their Head and Face is ſomewhat like a Lion's. The Females are like Lioneſſes before, but their Hair is ſmooth all over like an Horſe's, whereas the Male is ſmooth only on his hinder Parts. From the hinder Part grow two large Fins like Feet, and two more out of the Breaſt, by Means of which they can climb rocks and Precipices, tho' they delight chiefly to lie aſleep near the Shore. Some are fourteen Feet long, and very fat; but in general they are about eight Feet: The Fleſh of the young ones is almoſt as white as Lamb, and tolerable good Eating. From the Shoulders to the Tail they grow tapering like Fiſh; and when the Females give ſuck to their Young they ſit upon their Fins, which grow out of their hinder Part. Their Hair is of different Colours, looking very ſleek when they come firſt out of the Sea.</p>
            <p>The Armadillo is as big nearly as a ſmall Sucking-Pig, the Body of it pretty large.
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:007859_0281_102DDC7DB975B780"/>It is incloſed in a thick Shell, which guards all its Back, and comes down on both Sides, meeting under the Belly, leaving room for the four Legs; the Head is ſmall, with a Noſe like a Hedgehog, and a pretty long Neck, which it thruſts out before its Body when it walks, but on any Danger ſhe draws it in under the Shell, and, thruſting in her Feet, ſhe lies ſtock-ſtill like a Land Turtle, and tho' you kick her about ſhe will not move herſelf. The Shell is jointed in the Middle of the Back, ſo that ſhe can turn the fore Part of her Body which Way ſhe pleaſes; the Feet are like thoſe of a Land Turtle, and it has ſtrong Claws, with which it digs Holes in the Ground, and burrows in them like a rabbit. Its Fleſh is very good Eating, and taſtes much like a Turtle.</p>
            <p>Nothing remarkable happen'd to us in theſe three Months. Our Proviſions, ſuch as they were, were not very difficult to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and we were ſupplied with Fire-wood enough from a ſmall Wood or Coppice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ſeven Miles from us. We ſeldom fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of bringing home ſomething every Night, and generally had a hot Supper. We paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed our Time as chearful as poor Fellows in our Circumſtances could. But we knew we could not take up this Place for our ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:007859_0282_102DDC7FADE26DF0"/>Abode; and there was no Likelihood of any Inhabitants near us, nor for many Miles round could we perceive the leaſt Traces of any ever having been there; and 'twas to no Purpoſe to expect the Sight of any Veſſel off at Sea; for, it being a deep Bay, and ſhoal Water, no Ships ever put in there, unleſs forced by Streſs of Weather, and then they muſt be wrecked. Nothing remain'd for us but to make a ſecond Attempt for the river <hi>Plate;</hi> for, if we ſhould march to the Inland Country in queſt of Inhabitants, poſſibly we ſhould meet with inſuperable Difficulties in finding the Way back again to what I may call our Home; whereas if we kept our Courſe along the Sea-ſhore we could not err. For which reaſons we reſolved upon another Attempt by the ſame rout, and, having laid in our Stock of Seal, Armadillos, and freſh Water, towards the latter End of <hi>May,</hi> we ſet forward once more.</p>
            <p>In three Days we travelled about ſeventy Miles; when towards Night, there came on a violent Storm of rain, Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which continued the whole Night: We had a plain open Country, and no Place of Shelter could be found; we had nothing to cover us but a Seal-ſkin Jacket, were half dead with Cold, and afraid how our Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:007859_0283_102DDC81EFDD1510"/>would hold out; for we met with no Supplies of any Kind by the Way. To proceed farther was only lengthening our Journey back again, which we feared, would be the Conſequence at laſt, even tho' we ſhould ſtill puſh on. There had been the ſtricteſt Harmony and Good-nature between us till now; but now we were like to have diſagreed even to parting. Some were for puſhing forward, be the Event what it might; and 'twas with Difficulty they were perſwaded not to divide. However, upon a repreſentation of the great Diſtance we were as yet from the Mouth of the river, and the Improbability of meeting with Supplies of Proviſion by the Way, our Debates ended, and we jointly concluded on making the beſt of our Way back to our Hut, having been a ſecond Time diſappointed in our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
            <p>After being arrived at our old Quarters, we began to conſult what Meaſures to take for our Security from the Inclemencies of the Weather, and to provide for our Subſiſtence, till it ſhould pleaſe God, one Way or other, to deliver us out of this Melancholy Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In order to avoid Diſputes about the laborious Part of getting Proviſions, we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to divide ourſelves into two Parties,
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:007859_0284_102DDC83B61EC838"/>who were, alternately, to provide for the Whole: Four were appointed to ſcour the Country one Day, and the other four the next. And we had bound ourſelves by an Oath never to quit each other, unleſs obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by a ſuperior Force; for tho' we had as yet ſeen no Footſteps of Inhabitants, we could not be certain there were none on this Part of the Globe. We had killed ſuch a Number of Seal, that they now became ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſhy of us, and had lived upon them ſo long that we were almoſt ſurfeited; yet there was hardly any thing elſe to be met with. We ſaw a great Number of wild Dogs, but could never come near enough to kill any; tho' now and then we chanced to ſhoot a Puppy, which, as it was change of Diet, we thought delicious Fare. We ſaw alſo ſome Deer, but could contrive no Method to take them. One Day in our rambles, we met with a Litter of young Puppies: they were but three, and ſeemed to be about two Months old, and taken Shelter in a Hole of one of the Sand-hills. We took 'em out, and brought 'em home to our Hut. Having diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd that theſe Puppies were whelped in Holes like thoſe of rabbits but larger, we went all out the next Day in queſt of more, and had the good Luck to find three Litters, in
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:007859_0285_102DDC86141FAC20"/>Number thirteen, which we carried home with us, deſigning if poſſible, to bring them up tame. We fed them with Broth made of Seals, and ſometimes with the Fleſh minced ſmall; and they afterwards became very ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to us. Each of us had his Brace of Dogs, which were brought up under as much Command as an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Spaniel, nor would they leave us to aſſociate with the wild Ones; they often ſupplied us with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madillos, and once they killed us a Deer. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Day hunting, we ſaw ſome wild Hogs, with their Young; our Dogs purſued them, and took two of the Young, which we ſaved alive; and we ſhot one of the old Ones, which afforded us many dainty Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. The young ones proved to be a Boar and a Sow, which was very fortunate, and we deſigned to rear them for Breeding, leſt we ſhould be obliged to a long reſidence in this deſolate Country. We brought them up very tame, inſomuch that they followed our Dogs when ever we went a hunting; and at Night both Dogs and Pigs, took up their Lodging with us in our Hut.</p>
            <p>For the preſent our Condition ſeemed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable; nay, we thought ourſelves in very comfortable Circumſtances: We wanted for nothing, and, if we could have confined our
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:007859_0286_102DDC88158DE9F0"/>Thoughts to preſent Enjoyments, our Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was very agreeable. But our Views were farther, and the Fears of what might happen frequently ſtruck a Damp on our Pleaſures. Winter was now approaching; we had the Inclemencies of the Seaſon to guard againſt, and if poſſible, a Stock of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions to be laid up againſt future Emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. but we could not be much before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with Proviſions, having no Salt to cure them, and at preſent not Sun enough to dry them; for with Winter came on continual Storms, with rains, inſomuch that ſome Days we could not ſtir out of our Hut.</p>
            <p>'Twas now more than ſeven Months ſince the Long-boat left us. Winter came on very faſt, and we were but badly ſecured from the Severity of the Weather. We reſolved im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatety to put our Habitation in Order, and to ſecure our Hut in the beſt Manner we could. Accordingly it was agreed that ſix ſhould ſtay at home next Day to prepare Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, and two only to go out after Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, the Lot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>e three Armadillos, tho's we travelled many Miles. 'Twas ſo dark before we returned, that we deſpaired of finding our Hut, and were like to have taken up our
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:007859_0287_102DDC8A617A7EE0"/>Lodging in the open Plain, if our Comrades had not come out in queſt of us, and, by making a Fire, directed us towards them. After we had broiled our Game, and fed heartily, about Twelve we went to ſleep. But, about Two in the Morning, a violent Storm, with rain, Thunder, and Lightning, threw down Part of the Cliff upon us, under which we had built our Hut, and was very near proving fatal to us all; but, thro' Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, none were hurt. With Day-light came on tolerable Weather; and now the firſt Thing we had to do was to rebuild our Hut. We immediately went to the Coppice where we uſed to ſeek our Fire-wood, in order to fell ſome Poles. As we had but one Hatchet betwixt us, one only could fell them, and the reſt of us brought them out and bundled 'em. We had cut ſeveral, and were bundling them, when we ſaw <hi>Joſ. Clinch</hi> running out of the Wood, and crying, <hi>Lord have Mercy upon us, here's a great Tyger.</hi> We were in the utmoſt Conſternation; for having been frequently there before, and never once ſeeing any Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteps of Wild Beaſts, we came without our Arms, ſuſpecting no Danger from that Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. We all took to our Heels, and ſoon ſaw him running out of the Wood in Purſuit of us. When he was come within twenty
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:007859_0288_102DDC8D2DE367F0"/>Yards of us, finding it impoſſible to eſcape him, we all turned towards him, clapping our Hands, and making a loud Holo, in order to frighten him, which had the deſired Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; for he immediately ſat back on his Tail, gazing at us. What to do we knew not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 'twas beſt to fly, or wait for his turning; but Fear prevailed, and we walked gently off, without his purſuing us. Next Day we all went with our Muſkets in Chace of him, but could not meet with him. We brought home our Poles, and fitted up our Hut in the beſt Manner we could, ſufficient to guard us from the rain.</p>
            <p>About three Weeks after, when we were hunting on the Plain, about four Miles from home, we ſaw a Lion couched on the Ground, watching his Prey, as we imagin'd, it being cloſe by a wild Cat's Hole. We joined cloſe together in a Body, with our Muſkets ready; and <hi>Joſ. Clinch</hi> fired a Ball at him at twenty Yards Diſtance, reſting his Piece on my Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but miſs'd him: The Lion took no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the report of the Gun, nor ſtirred from his Poſture. He charged a ſecond Time, ours being kept in readineſs in Caſe he ſhould advance towards us; he fired, and ſhot him in the right Shoulder; he fell on his Back, and we ran to him, and knock'd him in the
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:007859_0289_102DDC8F70878DB0"/>Head with the Bones of a dead Horſe which lay near him. We carried him to our Hut, dreſs'd his Heart and Part of his ribs; but 'twas very indifferent Eating.</p>
            <p>Finding ourſelves beginning to be ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with wild Beaſts, and every Day and Night in continual Danger (for we now ſeldom went abroad without meeting ſome Beaſt of Prey; this being, I ſuppoſe, the Time of Year when they take their Haunts towards the Sea-coaſt), we determin'd to make another Puſh for our Deliverance, and try our Fortune once more in an Expedition to <hi>Buenos Ayres.</hi> In order hereto we provided ourſelves Shoes and Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets of Seal-ſkins, and made ourſelves Knap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacks of the ſame to carry our Provender. The Weather was ſet in fair, and we were fully determin'd to lay in ſuch a Stock of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions as ſhould laſt us to the End of our Journey, if we ſhould be a Month in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it. To this End we divided ourſelves into two Parties; four of us were to go to the rocks for Seal, and the other four to hunt on the Plain. Accordingly we ſet out early in the Morning: 'twas my Lot, with <hi>Sam. Coop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, John Andrews,</hi> and <hi>John Duck,</hi> to go to the rocks. Our uſual Way in killing Seal being with Stones or Clubs, we never carried our Muſkets with us, we had been out all Day,
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:007859_0290_102DDC91C8AC8CF0"/>and killed three; and in the Duſk of the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when we were got within a Stone's Caſt of our Hut, I perceiv'd our Dogs very buſy at a ſmall Diſtance, wagging their Tails in a very fondling Manner. Being a-head of my Companions, I paſſed on without much regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, thinking they had lighted on a dead Colt. But when I came to the Hut, I was quite confounded: The Hut was rifled, and all our Neceſſaries taken away. In the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Conſternation I ran back to my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades, whom I ſaw ſtanding where I had left the Dogs: Seeing me running eagerly towards them, they cry'd out, <hi>What's the Matter,</hi> Iſaac? I told them our Hut was pull'd down, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing taken away. <hi>Ay,</hi> ſaid they, <hi>and ſomething worſe has happened; for yonder lie poor</hi> Guy Broad-water <hi>and</hi> Ben. Smith <hi>murder'd.</hi> 'Twas a moſt ſhocking Sight: One had his Throat cut and the other was ſtabb'd in the Breaſt; they were hardly cold, ſo we thought the Murderers could not be far off. And we were under no ſmall Apprehenſion of ſharing a like Fate. We went to the Hut to inſpect more narrowly, and found every thing taken away; our Powder, Ball, and Muſkets gone, the Fire extinguiſh'd, and not the leaſt Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſil left. Where to go or what to do we knew not. We durſt not truſt ourſelves another
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:007859_0291_102DDC93FA8CC8E8"/>Night on this fatal Spot, and yet were afraid to venture farther. At laſt we came to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of going to the next ſandy Bay, about a Mile off, and take up our Quarters there for that Night: But, when there, we could find no Shelter, not ſo much as a Cliff to lie under; ſo were obliged to return to our old Place, and paſs the Night there, happen what would. Next Morning the Dogs which belonged to our Comrades ſtood on the Top of the Cliff barking at us, and would not come down, tho' we called them by their Names; and 'twas with Difficulty we enticed them down in the Evening. What became of <hi>Joſ. Clinch</hi> and <hi>John Allen</hi> we knew not, nor could we after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards learn any Account of them: What ſeem'd moſt probable to us was, that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> had carried them off, and murder'd the other two, who poſſibly might make ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, as we had all agreed to do, in Caſe we ſhould be attack'd; but, if ſo, we might probably have expected to have found ſome or other of their Enemies killed, as our People had Fire-Arms with them. And it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible it could be the reſult of a Quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt themſelves, from the Manner of their Death; for one was ſtabb'd, and the other had his Throat cut, both very plainly done with a Knife, an Inſtrument which none of
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:007859_0292_102DDC964CD942C8"/>us had the Poſſeſſion of. We buried 'em in the the beſt Manner we could, by ſcraping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the light Sand with our Hands two Feet deep, and raiſing a Bed of Sand over the Corpſes.</p>
            <p>This was the moſt afflicting Stroke of any we received ſince our reſidence in this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Country. I won't pretend to deſcribe the Horrors we felt; the compaſſionate reader will paint our Diſtreſs in his Imagination in ſtronger Colours than can be deſcribed by Words. To ſee four of our Companions ſnatched from us ſuddenly we knew not how, ourſelves deprived of our Arms and Utenſils, left without Fire, or any Method of procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, expecting every Moment to ſhare their Fate, or to be ſtarved to Death, filled us with unſpeakable Terrors.</p>
            <p>In this melancholy State the only thing that remain'd to be done was immediately to quit this unhappy Place, and make one Attempt more for <hi>Buenos Ayres.</hi> We had no Time to loſe, but inſtantly ſet about tearing up the Seal in ſmall Pieces, raw as it was, with which we filled our Knapſacks, and their Bladders we filled with Water, leſt we ſhould find none on our Journey. Having furniſh'd our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves with as much Proviſion as we could carry, we ſet forward on our Journey, with
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:007859_0293_102DC7076EA400A0"/>our ſixteen Dogs and two Pigs; praying the Almighty to be our Guide. We kept cloſe along the Sea Coaſt, as we had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by which Means we could not miſs the <hi>River Plate;</hi> where when we ſhould arrive our Deſign was to travel along the Side of that river till we ſhould come to ſome inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Place: A Scheme eaſy enough in Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, but in Practice attended, as we found, with inſuperable Difficulties.</p>
            <p>The Sea Coaſt all along is a plain ſandy Beach; on the Land Side are here and there very high Sand-hills: In the Valleys of thoſe Hills we repoſed ourſelves at Night. On the Beach we ſometimes found ſome Cockles, which the Sea had waſh'd in; theſe were a great Dainty to us. We met with Part of the Wreck of a large Ship which was drove upon the Beach, particularly a Man of War's Gang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, and a Piece of Plank mark'd fifteen Foot. In the Valleys of the Sand-hills was Plenty of Water, which had been ponded up after the rains; and we frequently met with dead Fiſh thrown in upon the Beach; ſo that we had a Variety of raw Meat to feed upon. We alſo found by the Sea-ſide a very large dead Whale which was a Feaſt for our Dogs and Pigs, and at a little Diſtance a Parcel of fine Whale-bone.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="272" facs="unknown:007859_0294_102DDC9A32B9EE70"/>
At the End of ten Days we made the Cape of the river, having travelled very hard every Day, and met with tolerable Weather, but when we got there we found a Multitude of ſmall rivers and muddy Swamps to obſtruct us. We ſwam over ſeveral of them, with our Knapſacks acroſs our Shoulders; and when Night came on we cover'd ourſelves with the ruſhes, but were almoſt devour'd by Muſke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes. Next Day we made ſeveral Attempts to proceed farther, but found it impoſſible to accompliſh our Journey; the farther we went the greater Difficulties we met with. We were ſeveral times in Danger of being ſuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, the Bog often ſinking us to the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; ſo that, after many fruitleſs Attempts to proceed, we found we had no remedy left but to tread back the melancholy Path, and return to our old Place of rendezvous; which we performed in leſs than ten Days.</p>
            <p>At our return we were afraid to ramble far abroad, having neither Arms nor Ammunition to defend ourſelves from the Wild Beaſts. Our two Pigs maintained us near a Fortnight, and afterwards we were obliged to live upon ſome of our truſty Dogs; but this raw Way of feeding, which continued three Months long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, brought us into an ill State of Health. About a Quarter of a Mile from our Hut we
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:007859_0295_102DDC9CECADA328"/>found a dead Horſe, of which now and then we took a Morſel, by Way of Change; and could we have got Fire to dreſs it, the Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety would have been agreeable enough. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding our Fears, Neceſſity compell'd us to go abroad in Search of other kind of Proviſions, and ſometimes we had the good Fortune to bring home an Armadillo.</p>
            <p>One Morning we found the Trunk of a large Tree, and imagined 'twas not impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with the Help of the Skins of Seal and Horſes, to make a Sort of a Boat with it, which might ſerve to convey us along Shore to the river <hi>Plate.</hi> But we had no kind of Tool to uſe. <hi>J. Duck</hi> recollected that about eleven Months before, at the End of our firſt Attempt for <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> he threw away his Muſket, it being a very indifferent one, and not worth the trouble of bringing home, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving enough beſides for our Uſe. We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to go in Search of it, which if we could find might ſerve to make a Hatchet, Acoord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly we furniſh'd ourſelves with ſome ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> Seal and Water, went, and found the Muſket, tho' above ſixty Miles. On our return home we found ſeveral Oſtriches Eggs, about half buried in the Sand, which was a refreſhing Meal to us (tho' we never met with any of the Birds.) When we brought it home <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>
               <pb n="274" facs="unknown:007859_0296_102DDC9F373C07A8"/>beat half the length of the Barrel flat with Stones, and whetted an Edge to it againſt a rock, the other Half ſerved for the Handle, and it made a tolerable Hatchet; at leaſt what would have ſerved inſtead of one, if Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence had not put an End to our Deſign in the following Manner.</p>
            <p>Two Days after we had finiſhed our Hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, it being my Turn to ſtay in the Hut, my three Comrades went to a Place which we called the <hi>Long Point</hi> in Search of Proviſions. Towards Evening I walked out to ſee if they were returning; when, to my Aſtoniſhment, I diſcover'd about a Dozen of Horſes gallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the ſandy Bay towards our Hut, and, as they came nearer, I plainly ſaw Men on their Backs, and that they were <hi>Indians.</hi> 'Twas in vain to fly; I imagined nothing but Death approaching, and prepared to meet it with all the reſolution I could muſter up. I ran towards them, and fell on my Knees, begging my Life with all the Signs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility I could make; when I heard a Voice ſaying, <hi>Don't be afraid</hi> Iſaac! <hi>we are all here.</hi> This revived me. The <hi>Indians</hi> alighted, and whilſt ſome were intent on examining the Hut, others ſtood with drawn Knives, ready to diſpatch us in caſe we made any reſiſtance. When they had ſatisfied ther Curioſity they
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:007859_0297_102DDCA189963558"/>gave three confuſed Shouts, and immediately made us get up behind them, and carried us away a few Miles in from the Sea-ſhore to the S. W. where were about a Dozen more of their Companions, with upwards of four hundred Horſes which they had taken in Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They treated us with great Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, killed a Horſe for us, kindled a Fire, and roaſted a Part of it, which to us, who had been three Months eating raw Fleſh, was a moſt delicious Entertainment. They alſo gave each of us a Piece of an old Blanket to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our Nakedneſs. I was in great Danger, it ſeems, of being left alone; for when the <hi>Indians</hi> met with my three Comrades, they were immediately for hurrying them away to their Place of rendezvous, till, with Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they were brought to underſtand, by Signs, that there was one more belonging to them a little Way off; and then guided them to the Hut, where I had the Happineſs of being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Priſoner with them.</p>
            <p>Next Morning we decamped from this Place, driving our Troop of Horſe before us. We travelled nineteen Days before we arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at their next Place of rendezvous, which. I imagine, was about two hundred Miles from our Hut to the S. W. in a Valley be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two very high Mountains, where was
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:007859_0298_102DDCA3268CCA28"/>fine Paſture for their Horſes, and ſeveral ſmall rivers of freſh Water, but very little Wood to be ſeen for many Miles round. In this Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley were about a Dozen <hi>Indian</hi> Huts, built with Poles and the Skins of Horſes, inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by another Party of <hi>Indians,</hi> with their Wives and Children, who gazed very earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on us, as tho' they had never ſeen any White People before. Here we were bought and ſold four different Times for a Pair of Spurs, a Braſs Pan, Oſtriches Feathers, and ſuch like Trifles, which was the low Price generally ſet on each of us; and ſometimes we were played away at Dice; ſo that we chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Maſters ſeveral Times in a Day. In this Place we remained near a Month, by which Time the ſeveral Parties of <hi>Indians</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from their Hunting, and joined us, each Party bringing the Horſes they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in hunting, and mixing them all in the common Stock; which were examin'd and told over by one of the <hi>Indians</hi> who ſeemed to be a ſort of a Captain over the reſt, and they amounted to the Number of fifteen Hundred and upwards, ſome of which were no way inferior to the beſt of our <hi>European</hi> Breed.</p>
            <p>After one Day's grand Feaſting, we ſet out in a Body for their Chief Town, where the
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:007859_0299_102DDCA5D94E6C90"/>King, or Captain, lived, with fifteen hundred String of Horſes in our Cavalcade. We were four Months in performing our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and, by the Method of our traveling, I believe it muſt be a thouſand Miles from the Sea-Coaſt where our Hut ſtood. In the Day-time we travelled, and at Night repoſed ourſelves in their moveable Huts, which ſhelter'd us from the Weather. Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Food was Horſe-fleſh, which ſome choſe to eat raw, and others broiled or roaſted; and, as for Drink, we never fail'd of Water; for I found they were well acquainted with every ſmall rivulet, of which there are Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the rout they took, tho' a Stranger would hardly have found them.</p>
            <p>At length we arrived to the End of our Journey, the Chief Town, where the King lives; but our Maſters who had made the laſt Purchaſe of us were carrying us with them to their own Home (which we learnt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was about two hundred Miles beyond the Town where the King reſided) and had carried us ſome Miles; when a Party of Horſe came after us, and brought us back to the Capital, the King claiming us as his Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This Town conſiſts of about 30 Huts, built, in a low irregular Manner, with Poles and Horſes Skins, ſurrounded with Paliſadoes,
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:007859_0300_102DE9254F597D38"/>about three Foot Diſtance from each other. The Inhabitants, Men, Women, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, were about fourſcore. We were ſoon ſummoned to appear before his Majeſty, who received us in his Hut, ſitting on the Ground, with a Javelin on one Side of him, and a Bow and Arrows on the other, a looſe Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle round his Waiſt, and a ſort of Turret of Oſtriches Feathers on his Head, and a long reed Pipe in his Mouth, ſmoaking. After paying our Obedience to him, he began to aſk us ſeveral Queſtions in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> of which they all can ſpeak a little, which we ſoon let him know we underſtood a little of; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired what Countrymen we were, and how we came to this Country. We told him we were <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> loſt in the <hi>South-Sea,</hi> in an <hi>Engliſh</hi> Man of War, as we were going to fight againſt our Enemies the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> that we were eight in Number who were left on a deſolate Part of the Continent; that one Evening, on our return from getting Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, we found two of our Companions mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and two more carried off, on the Spot of Ground where we were taken, our Hut pull'd down, and every thing taken from us; which we ſuppoſed muſt be done by ſome of his Countrymen. He then called three or four of his Men, and talked very
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:007859_0301_102DC71041874410"/>earneſtly to them in their own Language. But it ſeems they knew nothing of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, as he told us; tho' he was pleaſed to aſſure us ſtrict Enquiry ſhould be made of the other Parties which were out at the ſame Time. For I found by him, that he ſends out ſeveral different Parties every Spring from every different Town under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who take different routs, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times join one another accidentally on their return. But of this more hereafter. When he found we were at War with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he expreſs'd a great deal of Joy, and aſk'd if we were Great Men in our Country. We told him yes. He ſaid the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were great Enemies to them, had took away their Country from them, and drove them to the Mountains. When he had done examining us, he ordered a Horſe to be killed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and dreſs'd for us; and lodged us in his own Hut for that Night, till we had one built for us, which was the next Day. Here we ſtaid eight Months, and winter'd, during which Time we had frequently Snow five or ſix Feet deep. Our Work was chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fetch Wood and Water, and ſkin all the Horſes which they killed; and tho' we were their Slaves, we were treated very humanely, and they would ſuffer no one to uſe us ill.
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:007859_0302_102DDCA7F6EAF1D8"/>There were four <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Women in the Town, whom they had taken captive in a Skirmiſh near <hi>Buenos-Ayres;</hi> and the King told us, with a Smile, he would give us each a Wife.</p>
            <p>The Country where theſe <hi>Indians</hi> reſided, as indeed the whole Coaſt of <hi>Patagonia,</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fruitful in Paſture, and abounds with great Plenty of wild Horſes, and a few black Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, which are entirely neglected by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians;</hi> Horſe-fleſh being preferr'd by them for eating, before any other Kind of Fleſh, and what they conſtantly feed upon. 'Tis ſituated in a very healthy Climate, and, if the Soil was cultivated, would certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Plenty of all Kind of Crain. They have likewiſe Plenty of Wood, tho' few or no Timber Trees, ſeveral large Coppices grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all round the Country, tho' near the Sea-ſide we ſee nothing but a plain open ſand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Coaſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Patagonian Indians,</hi> at leaſt thoſe in that Part of the Country where we reſided, were tall and well-made, being in general, from five to ſix Feet high, good-natur'd and obliging to one another, and never ſee each other Want. Tho' they have what they call a King, yet he ſeems to be only a Chief or Captain of a Party; for, as they have no ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Abode, but live ſcattered throughout that
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:007859_0303_102DDCAA976CEED8"/>Part of the World in little Towns or Parties, each Party ſeems to have a Chief, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fides over them like a Petty King. I never could obſerve any rules of Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong 'em; but in a Drinking-bout King and Subjects are all alike. Their King is diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd from the reſt by his being the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt Man, and by wearing a kind of Saſh round his Waiſt. 'Tis true he has a Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence paid him by his Subjects, and whatever he orders to be done is immediately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, being himſelf exempted from any kind of Work; but I never ſaw any Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted by him, nor any Quarrels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong themſelves, except when they get at a Drinking-Feaſt, and then their Wives always took Care no ill Conſequence ſhould follow, by putting every Weapon out of their Way, and eſpecially taking Care of their Knives. For which reaſon I imagine that in Liquor they are always quarrelſome. One or two Inſtances of that Kind happen'd whilſt we were among them. Their Method of Feaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this: They have in the Summer a Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ſmall ſweet Berries growing like our Whortle Berries, and when they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a ſufficient Quantity of them, they dig a Pit in the Ground, about four Feet ſquare, the Bottom and Sides of which they line
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:007859_0304_102DDCAC399420A8"/>with Horſe Hides. This Caſk (if I may ſo call it) they half fill with theſe Berries, and then fill it up with Water, which they ſtir well with Sticks, and afterwards leave it to ferment about forty eight Hours. They all ſit round, ſmoaking and drinking, for a whole Night together, Women as well as Men, ſing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Way, but more like ſhrieking Cries; and when drunk frequently proceed to Blows.</p>
            <p>They ſeldom live long in one Place; for when their Horſes have eat up the Paſture in one Place, they remove their Town and all their Goods, which is ſoon done, a few Miles from the Former; and this ſeveral Times in the Year; ſo that they have no ſettled Place of Abode. They have ſcatter'd Habitations all over the Country, and but few Huts together: The Town where their Chief reſides has three times the Number of Dwellings to any of the reſt which I ſaw.</p>
            <p>They ſeem to have ſome Notion of a Deity, and pay a ſort of Worſhip to the Sun and Moon; eſpecially at every New Moon, they collect themſelves in a Body, and make a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Proceſſion round the Town, one going before with a kind of Hoop in his Hand, round which are tied little Braſs Bells a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with Oſtriches Feathers, which he
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:007859_0305_102DE8FBD8806660"/>would frequently ſwing round in his Hand; and then the whole Company would make a moſt hideous Noiſe, which, I ſuppoſe, they deſigned for Singing. This Ceremony uſual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly laſted about half an Hour. This Method with their Hoop and Bells is likewiſe uſed when any of them are ſick or dying. A white Flannel Cloth is hung up before the ſick Perſon, and the Man with his Hoops and Bells, who is generally one of his relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, comes to viſit him; and after a few Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes Converſation, he leaves him, and walks ſeveral times round the Hut, jingling his Bells, and talking aloud in a variety of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents which we could underſtand nothing of, but imagined he deſigned it for Prayers for his ſick Friend. When any of 'em dies, they ſoon bury him, generally the next Morning. They roll the Dead Body in a Hide, with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Thing that belongs to him, as Bows, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and carry it, without any Ceremony, at ſome Diſtance from the Town; where they throw it into a large round Pit, dug on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, which they afterwards fill up with Earth. Yet notwithſtandind they have no Ceremony at their Funeral, their Mourning for the Dead is very ſtrict, which the Friends of the Deceaſed obſerve for three Months; during which Time they remove themſelves
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:007859_0306_102DE8FE65A106B0"/>at a Diſtance from any of the reſt of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and converſe with nobody; but are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with Proviſions from the whole Town, by the King's Order, 'till the Time of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is over. They ſeem to have ſome Notion of the Devil, at leaſt are afraid of Apparitions; for none of 'em will ſtir out of his Hut, when dark, without Company. And one Night in particular we heard a great Noiſe in the Town, like ſeveral Drums beating, which, the next Day, we found to be ſome of the <hi>Indians</hi> beating the Sides of their Houſes, which were made of Horſe-Skins, with large Sticks, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to frighten away the Devil.</p>
            <p>Each <hi>Indian</hi> has but one Wife, and they live together in a very loving Manner. When any of 'em lye-in, there's a Proviſion made for them different from what they are acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated with at another Time; for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Hut, which at other Times is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways open, is ſhut up with Horſes-Skins as ſoon as the Woman begins to be in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail; and no one goes in till ſhe comes out with the Child in her Arms, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently wrapt up in a Sheep's Skin, and, inſtead of a Bed or Cradle, is lain an a Machine ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like our Hand-barrow, the Bottom of which is likewiſe covered with a Sheep's Skin. This is hung up by the four Corners,
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:007859_0307_102DE900C6CF58E0"/>and the Child ſwings forwards and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, inſtead of being rock'd in a Cradle, its Arms and Legs being faſten'd to this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine by a Laſh of Horſe-ſkin, to prevent its falling over. By this Method of Treatment, when Children, the back Part of all the <hi>Indians</hi> Heads are very flat; for they never lay them but on their Backs. Perhaps it may be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this likewiſe that there is not a crooked Perſon amongſt them. In two or three Hours after they have lain-in they go about their uſual Work. Every Morning they take all their Children, young and old, and carry them to the next Brook or rivulet adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and plunge them naked under Water, even when the ground is covered with Snow; by which Means they are harden'd to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout naked, even in the Midſt of Winter. The Men wear Beads and little Bells round their Neck, Wriſt, and ſmall of their Legs; and the Women adorn their long Hair with the ſame. For ſuch Trifles as theſe, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Knives, Braſs Pans, and ſuch like, they traffick their Hides with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> when at Peace with them.</p>
            <p>And now their Time for making the Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Voyage approaching, which they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually do every Spring, and generally ſpend a whole Summer in taking their wild Horſes,
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:007859_0308_102DE903EB9C0830"/>we made great Interceſſion to go with them; but were given to underſtand, that we muſt be ſent farther into the Country, to remain with other <hi>Indians</hi> till their return. But at laſt we prevailed, by aſſuring the Chief that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> had Friends at <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> who would make him very handſome Satisfaction for us, and would redeem us at any Price he ſhould put upon us. This ſeemed to pleaſe him, and he then conſented. We were at preſent about 1000 Miles from <hi>Buenos Ayres;</hi> and their rout extends to the Eaſtern Coaſt of <hi>Patagonia,</hi> home to the Sea, about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Miles to the Southward of <hi>Buenos Ayres.</hi> When they ſet out, they carry with them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Thing belonging to them, Women, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Houſes, and all. Theſe laſt are ſlung acroſs the Horſes, and at Night taken down for ſheltering themſelves from the Weather. They take with them a few Horſes more than they ride, which ſerve for maintaining them till their Hunting begins, which ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom happens till they have travelled ſeven or eight Days.</p>
            <p>And now the wiſh'd for Time was come, when we all ſet out in a Body, except <hi>John Duck,</hi> whoſe Misfortune it was to be too near of a Complexion with thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> (for he was a <hi>Molat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>o,</hi> born in <hi>London</hi>) for which
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:007859_0309_102DE9059364F358"/>reaſon he was ſold by the Chief to a Maſter farther up in the Country; where, I believe, he will end his Days, there being no Proſpect of his ever returning to <hi>England.</hi> We had travell'd ten or twelve Days before we had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wild Horſes; but ſoon after ſeveral Strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers ſell Victims to their Ingenuity. Their Method of taking them is really aſtoniſhing, and worthy of a very particular Deſcription. As they are excellent Horſemen, and their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes as fleet as the wild Ones, 'tis very ſeldom they miſs, tho' now and then an Accident of that Kind happens; but the rider is look'd upon with Contempt. They have two different Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of taking them, each of which I have ſeen them perform with incredible Dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The firſt is with a Laſh of Horſe Skins, about two Inches Broad, and fifty Feet long, with a running Nooſe at one End of it. This Nooſe they hold in their right Hand, and the other End in the Left, till they come within a few Yards of the Beaſt, when they throw the Nooſe over his Head, even on full Speed, and hold the other End faſt in their Left Hand. The Beaſt is ſoon ſtopt and taken. The other Method is with a narrow Strap of Horſe-ſkin, about twelve Feet long, to each End of which is faſtened a round Ball of Iron, about two Pounds Weight. When within
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:007859_0310_102DE9087757A9E0"/>Diſtance of their Game, they hurl one of the Balls ſeveral Times round their Head, till they have got the proper Swing, and then throw it at the Horſe's Legs, parting with the Ball in their Left Hand at the ſame Time; which ſeldom fails of entangling their Legs, and throwing them to the Ground. The Horſes thus taken are ſecured by ſome of the Company, whoſe Buſineſs is chiefly to tie theſe Horſes together in a String, and guard them. In a few Days they become very tame. They are likewiſe very dextrous in killing Birds with theſe Balls, and will throw them to a prodigious Height in the Air. This is what they are trained up to from their Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and are very expert at, even in their Youth. Theſe Iron Balls, faſten'd in the above Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, are likewiſe their chief warlike Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, next to their Bows and Arrows.</p>
            <p>Being now arrived within an hundred Miles of <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> we begged of him to diſpatch one of his Men to the Governor, to acquaint him of three <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoners he had with him at ſuch a Diſtance, and to aſk if he would redeem us; which he did. And the Meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, on his return, brought him a certain Pledge for fulfilling his Promiſe, which was a Gold-laced Waiſtcoat. Next Day we were told to get ourſelves ready to go to <hi>Buenos
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:007859_0311_102DE90B0E7ED890"/>Ayres,</hi> and that he and ſome of his Men would go with us.</p>
            <p>The Hopes of once more ſeeing our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chriſtians filled us with Joy. We were brought immediately before the Governor, who ſatisfy'd our <hi>Indian</hi> Prince, and paid him his ranſom, which was ninety Dollars, and a few Trifles, and then diſmiſs'd him. We return'd him our hearty Thanks for his Kindneſs towards us during our abode with him; in which Time we were treated with greater Humanity, than we afterwards met with in our long Confinement on board the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Admiral <hi>Pizarro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After we had paſs'd Examination by the Governor, and had given him a full Account of our paſt Misfortunes, we were for a ſhort Time diſmiſs'd upon Parole. And here I ſhould be very ungrateful if I did not do Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the Preſident of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Aſſiento Houſe, Mr. <hi>Grey,</hi> by acknowledging that 'twas entirely owing to his Compaſſion and kind In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion with the Governor, that we were thus redeemed from the Hands of the <hi>Indians,</hi> he offering to do it at his own Charge. We were ſent for ſeveral Times before the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, and earneſtly preſt to turn Catholicks, and ſerve the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> but our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer was, we were Proteſtants, and true <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſhmen,</hi>
               <pb n="290" facs="unknown:007859_0312_102DE90CD246D928"/>and hoped to die ſo. Many tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Offers were made to ſeduce us; but, thank God, we reſiſted them all. When he found all his Efforts were of no Effect, we were ſent as Priſoners of War on board the <hi>Aſia,</hi> which lay then at <hi>Monte Vedio,</hi> about thirty Leagues down the river, waiting for Orders, and had lain there upwards of two Years. This was the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Admiral <hi>Pizarro</hi>'s Ship, which, after an unſucceſsful Attempt to paſs <hi>Cape Horn,</hi> in order to be in the <hi>South Seas</hi> with his Squadron before ours, was, by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſtuous Weather, drove back, and obliged to put into the river <hi>Plate,</hi> having loſt near half her Crew; the Admiral having quitted her, and gone over Land to <hi>Chili.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We were confin'd on board the <hi>Aſia</hi> above a Year, with 16 other <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoners, in which Time we were treated more like Slaves than Priſoners of War. Our Buſineſs was to do all their naſty Work; to ſwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and clean the Decks, fore and aft, every Morning; and, after the Work was done, were confin'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Decks, with a Centin over us, as tho' we had been Criminals, with a poor Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Victuals. In ſhort, our Uſage was ſo bad that we agreed with the reſt of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoners to attempt our Liberty, tho' at the riſque of our Lives. Accordingly one
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:007859_0313_102DE90F6A3B0CE8"/>Night we eſcaped from our Guard, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſwim aſhore, and travel to a <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gueſe</hi> Settlement on the North Side of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Ship lying within a Quarter of a Mile of the Shore. Myſelf and one more got ſafe to Land; the others were diſcovered before they got into Water. I was quite naked; the other had a Shirt wrapped round his Head. Before we got halfway to the Shore, a Gun was fir'd from the Ship to alarm the Town. We travelled till Two in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then lay down among the ruſhes. The Weather being very froſty, our Feet ſwell'd and full of Thorns, we could travel no farther. Soon after Day-light we met with ſome Men on Horſeback, belonging to the Plantations, to whom we ſurrendered our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and they took us behind them to their Houſe. The next Day we were carried from thence by ſome Soldiers, who were ſent in Purſuit of us, and were carried on board the Ship; where we were put in the Stocks, Neck and Heels, Four Hours every Day for a Fortnight.</p>
            <p>At length we were inform'd of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's Arrival at <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> who ſoon after came on board, and gave Orders for refitting the Ship in the beſt Manner they could, being determin'd to carry her to <hi>Old Spain.</hi> But
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:007859_0314_102DE9126375E950"/>there was a geat Deficiency of Hands, for which reaſon Orders were given to impreſs what Men they could at <hi>Monte Vedio.</hi> Theſe, with the 11 <hi>Indians</hi> whom they had four Months before taken Priſoners in a Skirmiſh at a Diſtance from <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> whom they deſign'd for their Row Gallies, were ſent on board; and ſoon after I had the Pleaſure of ſeeing my Brother Midſhipman Mr <hi>Campbell,</hi> who was loſt in the <hi>Wager</hi> with us, but chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to follow the Fortune of Capt. <hi>Cheap,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived with him at <hi>Chili.</hi> He came by Land from <hi>Chili</hi> with ſome Officers belonging to the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Admiral, and arrived in <hi>March</hi> at <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enos Ayres.</hi> The latter End of <hi>October</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, 1745, we ſet ſail from <hi>Monte Vedio</hi> in the <hi>Aſia</hi> bound for <hi>Spain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Three Days after we ſailed, an Affair hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened on board, which was like to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved fatal to the whole Crew; for about Nine at Night, we were alarmed with the Cry of a Mutiny; and ſo indeed it proved: But ſuch a one as would never have been ſuſpected by any of the Ship's Crew, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps credited by Poſterity, if ſuch a Number of Perſons were not ſtill living to atteſt the Fact. But, leſt I ſhould do Injuſtice to the Memory of ſuch a ſurpriſing Event, I ſhall beg Leave to relate it in the Language of Mr.
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:007859_0315_102DE914700716F8"/>
               <hi>Walters,</hi> aſſuring the reader that I was a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the whole Affair.</p>
            <p>"<hi>Pizarro</hi> had not yet compleated the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his Adventures; for when he and <hi>Mendinuetta</hi> came back by Land from <hi>Chili</hi> to <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> in the Year 1745, they found at <hi>Monte Vedio</hi> the <hi>Aſia,</hi> which near three Years before they had left there. This Ship they reſolved, if poſſible, to carry to <hi>Europe;</hi> and with this View they refitted her in the beſt manner they could. But their great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty was to procure a ſufficient Number of Hands to navigate her; for all the remaining Sailors of the Squadron to be met with in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to an hundred Men. They endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſupply this Defect by preſſing and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on board many of the Inhabitants of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enos Ayres,</hi> beſides all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoners then in their Cuſtody, together with a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Portugueſe</hi> Smugglers, whom they had taken at different Times, and ſome of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> of the Country. Among theſe laſt was a Chief and ten of his Followers, who had been ſurprized by a Party of <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Soldiers about three Months before. The Name of this Chief was <hi>Orellana.</hi> He belonged to a very powerful Tribe which had committed great ravages in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Buenos Ayres.</hi>
               <pb n="294" facs="unknown:007859_0316_102DE91619095CE0"/>With this motley Crew (all of them, except the <hi>European Spaniards,</hi> extremely averſe to the Voyage) <hi>Pizarro</hi> ſet ſail from <hi>Monte Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio,</hi> in the <hi>River</hi> of <hi>Plate,</hi> about the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> 1745. And the native <hi>Spaniards,</hi> being no Strangers to the Diſſatisfaction of their forced Men, treated both theſe, the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Priſoners, and the <hi>Indians,</hi> with great Inſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Barbarity; but more particularly the <hi>Indians:</hi> For it was common for the meaneſt Officers in the Ship to beat them moſt cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, on the ſlighteſt Pretences, and oftentimes only to exert their Superiority. <hi>Orellana</hi> and his Followers, tho' in Appearance ſufficiently patient and ſubmiſſive, meditated a ſevere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for all theſe Inhumanities. As he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed very well in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> (theſe <hi>Indians</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Times of Peace, a good Intercourſe with <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi>) he affected to talk with ſuch of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> as underſtood that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and ſeemed very deſirous of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed how many <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> there were on board, and which they were. As he knew that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were as much Enemies to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as himſelf, he had doubtleſs an Intention of diſcloſing his Purpoſe to them, and making them Partners in the Scheme he had projected for revenging his Wrongs and recovering his Liberty. But having ſounded
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:007859_0317_102DE919ED1E9920"/>them at a Diſtance, and not finding them ſo precipitate and vindictive as he expected, he proceeded no further with them; but reſolved to truſt alone to the reſolution of his ten faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Followers. Theſe, it ſhould ſeem, readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged to obſerve his Directions, and to execute whatever Commands he gave them. And, having agreed on the Meaſures neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be taken, they firſt furniſhed themſelves with <hi>Dutch</hi> Knives, ſharp at the Point, which being the common Knives uſed in the Ship, they found no Difficulty in procuring. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides this, they employed their Leiſure in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly cutting out Thongs from raw Hides, of which there were great Numbers on board, and in fiting to each End of theſe Thongs the double headed Shot of the ſmall Quarter-Deck Guns. This, when ſwung round their Heads, according to the Practice of their Country, was a moſt miſchievous Weapon, in the Uſe of which the <hi>Indians</hi> about <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi> are train'd from their Infancy, and conſequently are extremely expert. Theſe Particulars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in good Forwardneſs, the Execution of their Scheme was perhaps precipitated by a particular Outrage committed on <hi>Orellana</hi> himſelf. For one of the Officers, who was a very brutal Fellow, ordered <hi>Orellana</hi> aloft, which being what he was incapable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming,
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:007859_0318_102DE91B9673D938"/>the Officer, under Pretence of his Diſobedience, beat him with ſuch Violence that he left him bleeding on the Deck, and ſtupified for ſome Time with his Bruiſes and Wounds. This Uſage undoubtedly heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Thirſt for revenge, and made him eager and impatient till the Means of executing it were in his Power; ſo that, within a Day or two after this Incident, he and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers opened their deſperate reſolves in the enſuing Manner.</p>
            <p>"It was about Nine in the Evening, when many of the principal Officers were on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>he Quarter-Deck, indulging in the Freſhneſs of the Night Air; the Waiſt of the Ship was filled with live Cattle; and the Forecaſtle was manned with its cuſtomary Watch. <hi>Orellana</hi> and his Companions under Cover of the Night, having prepared their Weapons, and thrown off their Trowſers and the more cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berous Part of their Dreſs, came altogether on the Quarter-Deck, and drew towards the Door of the Great Cabbin. The Boatſwain immediately reprimanded them, and order'd them to be gone. On this <hi>Orellana</hi> ſpoke to his Followers in his Native Language; when four of them drew off, two towards each Gang-way, and the Chief and the ſix remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Indians</hi> ſeemed to be ſlowly quitting the
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:007859_0319_102DE91D41643768"/>Quarter Deck. When the detached <hi>Indians</hi> had taken Poſſeſſion of the Gang-way, <hi>Orella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> placed his Hands hollow to his Mouth, and bellowed out the War-Cry uſed by theſe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, which is the harſheſt and moſt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Sound known in Nature. This hideous Yell was the Signal for beginning the Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſacre: For on this they all drew their Knives, and brandiſh'd their prepared double Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Shot; and the ſix, with their Chief, which remained on the Quarter-Deck, immediately fell on the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were intermingled with them, and laid near forty of them at their Feet; of which about twenty were kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Spot, and the reſt diſabled. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Officers in the Beginning of the Tumult, puſhed into the great Cabin; where they put out the Lights, and barricadoed the Door; and of the others, who had avoided the firſt Fury of the <hi>Indians,</hi> ſome endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to eſcape along the Gangways into the Forecaſtle; but the <hi>Indians,</hi> placed there on Purpoſe, ſtabbed the greateſt Part of them as they attempted to paſs by, or forced them off the Gangways into the Waiſt: Others threw themſelves voluntarily over the Barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does into the Waiſt, and thought themſelves happy to lie concealed among the Cattle: But the greateſt Part eſcaped up the Main Shrowds,
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:007859_0320_102DE9202D6DF970"/>and ſheltered themſelves either in the Tops or rigging. And tho' the <hi>Indians</hi> attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only the Quarter-Deck, yet the Watch in the Forecaſtle, finding the Communication cut off, and being terrified by the Wounds of the few who, not being killed on the Spot, had Strength ſufficient to force their Paſſage along the Gangways, and not knowing either who their Enemies were, or what were their Numbers, they likewiſe gave all over for loſt, and, in great Confuſion, ran up into the rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Foremaſt and Bowſprit.</p>
            <p>"Thus, theſe eleven <hi>Indians,</hi> with a reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution perhaps without Example, poſſeſſed themſelves, almoſt in an Inſtant, of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Deck of a Ship mounting ſixty ſix Guns, with a Crew of near five hundred Men, and continued in peaceable Poſſeſſion of this Poſt a conſiderable Time: For the Officers in the Great Cabin (among whom were <hi>Pizarro</hi> and <hi>Mindinuetta</hi>) the Crew between Decks, and thoſe who had eſcaped into the Tops and rigging, were only anxious for their own Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and were for a long Time incapable of forming any Project for ſuppreſſing the Inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and recovering the Poſſeſſion of the Ship. It is true, the Yells of the <hi>Indians,</hi> the Groans of the Wounded, and the confuſed Clamours of the Crew, all heighten'd by the
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:007859_0321_102DE922CBE55D48"/>Obſcurity of the Night, had at firſt greatly magnify'd their Danger, and had filled them with the imaginary Terrors which Darkneſs, Diſorder, and an Ignorance of the real Strength of an Enemy, never fail to produce. For as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ſenſible of the Diſaffection of their preſt Hands, and were alſo conſcious of their Barbarity to their Priſoners, they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined the Conſpiracy was general, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider'd their own Deſtruction as infallible; ſo that, it is ſaid, ſome of them had once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the reſolution of leaping into the Sea, but were prevented by their Companions.</p>
            <p>"However, when the <hi>Indians</hi> had entirely clear'd the Quarter-Deck, the Tumult in a great meaſure ſubſided; for thoſe who had eſcaped were kept ſilent by their Fears, and the <hi>Indians</hi> were incapable of purſuing them, to renew the Diſorder. <hi>Orellana,</hi> when he ſaw himſelf Maſter of the Quarter-Deck, broke open the Arm-Cheſt, which, on a ſlight Suſpicion of Mutiny, had been ordered there a few Days before, as to a Place of the greateſt Security. Here he took it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he ſhould find Cutlaſſes ſufficient for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and his Companions, in the Uſe of which they were all extremely ſkilful; and with theſe, it was imagined, they purpoſed to force the Great Cabin. But on opening the Cheſt,
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:007859_0322_102DC70DA18AC2F0"/>there appeared nothing but Fire-Arms, which to them were of no Uſe. There were indeed Cutlaſſes in the Cheſt, but they were hid by the Fire Arms being laid over them. This was a ſenſible Diſappointment to them; and by this Tme <hi>Pizarro</hi> and his Companions in the Great Cabin were capable of converſing aloud, thro' the Cabin Windows and Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes, with thoſe in the Gun-room and be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tween Decks; and from hence they learnt that the <hi>Engliſh</hi> (whom they principally ſuſpected) were all ſafe below, and had not intermeddled in this Mutiny; and by other Particulars they at laſt diſcover'd, that none were concern'd in it but <hi>Orellana</hi> and his People. On this <hi>Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zarro</hi> and the Officers reſolved to atta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> them on the Quarter Deck, before any of the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contented on board ſhould ſo far recover their firſt Surprize as to reflect on the Facility and Certainty of ſeizing the Ship, by a Junction with the <hi>Indians,</hi> in the preſent Emergency. With this View <hi>Pizarro</hi> got together what Arms were in the Cabin, and diſtributed them to thoſe who were with him; but there were no other Fire-Arms to be met with but Piſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tols, and for theſe they had neither Powder nor Ball. However, having now ſettled a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondence with the Gun-room, they lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down a Bucket out of the Cabin Window,
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:007859_0323_102DE927667C3028"/>into which the Gunner, out of one of the Gun-room Ports, put a Quantity of Piſtol Cartriges. When they had thus procured Ammunition, and had loaded their Piſtols, they ſet the Cabin Door partly open, and fired ſome Shot among the <hi>Indians</hi> on the Quarter-Deck, at firſt without Effect; but at laſt <hi>Mendinuetta,</hi> whom we have often menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the good Fortune to ſhoot <hi>Orellana</hi> dead on the Spot. On which his faithful Companions, abandoning all Thoughts of farther reſiſtance, inſtantly leaped into the Sea; where they every Man periſhed. Thus was the Inſurrection quelled, and the Poſſeſſion of the Quarter-Deck regained, after it had been full two Hours in the Power of this Great and daring Chief, and his gallant and unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Countrymen."</p>
            <p>After this all was quiet; and the Admiral, finding that none of the <hi>Engliſh</hi> were engaged in this Inſurrection, for a few Days treated us with a little Humanity, endeavouring to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us, by large Promiſes of Preferment, to enter into the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Service. But finding nothing would work on us, we afterwards felt the Smart of his reſentment by a ſevere Uſage.</p>
            <p>Nothing remarkable happened afterwards, more than what commonly happens at Sea, till
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:007859_0324_102DE9290E7026D8"/>we arrived at <hi>Concubene,</hi> a Harbour about Five Leagues to the South of Cape <hi>Finiſterre;</hi> which was the latter End of <hi>February,</hi> 1745-6.</p>
            <p>We begged to be ſent aſhore as Priſoners of War, but were told we muſt go in the Ship to the <hi>Groyne.</hi> Whereupon we all went in a Body on the Quarter Deck, and told the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, if he would not ſend us aſhore, we would be no longer Slaves on board. Next Day we were ſent aſhore, and confined fifteen Days in a Priſon, with an Allowance only of Bread and Water, and chained together as Criminals, till the Ship ſail'd for the <hi>Groyne;</hi> when we were releaſed from our Dungeon, and guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the <hi>Groyne</hi> by Land with a File of Muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queteers. Where, as ſoon as we arrived, we were put into the Guard-Houſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> for two Days; from whence we were ſent to the Caſtle of <hi>St. Antonio,</hi> which is on an Iſland at the Entrance of the Harbour; a Priſon for Thieves and Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lons. In this diſmal Place we were kept Four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen Weeks, among the worſt of Malefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, till an Order came from the Court of <hi>Spain</hi> to ſend us to <hi>Portugal;</hi> allowing us a Guide, and a Real <hi>per</hi> Day.</p>
            <p>In Eight Days we got to <hi>Oporto,</hi> and made Application to the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Conſul, who, after hearing the Hardſhips we had gone
<pb n="303" facs="unknown:007859_0325_102DE92C1120DB70"/>through, gave us each Three Days Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance and a Quarter of a Moidore.</p>
            <p>On <hi>April</hi> 28, 1746, we embarked on board the <hi>Charlotta</hi> Snow, Capt. <hi>Henry Miller,</hi> bound for <hi>London,</hi> under Convoy of the <hi>York,</hi> and <hi>Folkſtone</hi> Men of War, and arrived at <hi>London</hi> on the 8th of <hi>July</hi> following: Three only of the Eight left on the <hi>Patagonian</hi> Coaſt being ſo happy as to ſee once more their native Country, viz. <hi>Samuel Cooper, John An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drews,</hi> and Myſelf."

I ſhall now conclude my Narrative with remarking, that I believe few, if any, of late Years, have gone thro' more Diſtreſſes, and Miſeries than myſelf; yet, in all my Trials, I was in ſome Degree bleſs'd with the Patience of holy <hi>Job,</hi> knowing, that as the Lord gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth, he can take away, and bleſſed be his ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Name.</p>

               <l>True Courage dwells not in a troubled Flood</l>
               <l>Of mounting Spirits and fermenting Blood.</l>
