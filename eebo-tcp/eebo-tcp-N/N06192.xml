            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>WE have pre≈øumed to put the following Sheets under your Protection, tho' we have not the Honour of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing per≈øonally known to you, nor have applied to you for the Liberty of u≈øing your celebrated Name on this Occa≈øion.</p>
            <p>As this Book is a faithful Extract from the Journals of two <hi>Briti≈øh</hi> Seamen, late Officers in his Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øty's Navy, we thought we could not more properly dedicate it than to a <hi>Briti≈øh</hi> Admiral.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:007859_0006_102DDA40DE6207C8"/>
We know your Dete≈øtation of Flattery; and you know, from long Experience, that a <hi>Briti≈øh</hi> Seaman hath a Spirit too brave to ≈øtoop to ≈øo degenerate a Practice.</p>
            <p>The following Pages we hope will recommend them≈øelves to you, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe they are written in a plain maritime Stile, and void of Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality and Prejudice.</p>
            <p>The Di≈øtre≈ø≈øes mention'd in this Book have perhaps not been equal'd in our Age; and we que≈øtion whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther any Navigators living have, for ≈øo long a Continuance, ≈øuffer'd ≈øuch Variety of Hard≈øhips, as the unfortunate People of the <hi>Wager.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After ≈øurviving the Lo≈øs of the Ship, and combating with Famine, and innumerable Difficulties, a Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of us are return'd to our Native Country; but even here we are ≈øtill unfortunate, de≈øtitute of Employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,

            <p>We, Sir, who pre≈øent you with this Book, have been ≈øeveral Years in the Navy, and thought our≈øelves well acquainted with its Laws and Di≈øcipline, and have many Certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates to produce, that we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways acted in Obedience to Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand; but the Proceedings of the Officers and People, ≈øince the Lo≈øs of the Ship, are reckoned ≈øo dark and intricate, that we know not what to expect, nor what will be the Re≈øult of our Superiors Deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination.</p>
            <p>The only Con≈øolation we have in our pre≈øent Anxiety, is placed in a Confidence of the unbias'd Integrity,
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:007859_0008_102DDA4553F72908"/>Ju≈øtice, and Humanity of the Right Honourable Per≈øons who will One Day determine for or again≈øt us.</p>
            <p>When you read our Account of the Affair, you'll find the Facts impartially related, the whole Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative written without the lea≈øt Shadow of Prejudice or Malice, and no more in Favour of our≈øelves than of the other Officers concern'd: We ≈øtand or fall by the Truth; if Truth will not ≈øupport us, nothing can.</p>
            <p>In our Voyage from the <hi>Brazil</hi> to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> we were oblig'd <hi>to you for the generous Treatment we met with from an Enemy, a Subject of</hi> Spain, <hi>a Per≈øon of Di≈øtinction, and a Pa≈ø≈øenger in the ≈øame Ship:</hi> Your Virtues have procured you the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteem even of your Enemies.</p>
            <p>Your Zeal for the <hi>National Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice,</hi> de≈øerves the Love of every <hi>Hone≈øt Briton:</hi> To leave an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>AS an Introduction, we think proper to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Reader with our Rea≈øons for cau≈øing the following Sheets to be made publick to the World. The chief Motive, which induced us to this Ta≈øk, was to clear our Characters, which have been exceedingly blemi≈øh'd by Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons who (next to Heaven) owe the Pre≈øervation of their Lives to our Skill, and indefatigable Care; and who having an Opportunity of arriving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore us in <hi>England,</hi> have endeavour'd to rai≈øe their Reputation on the Ruin of Ours.</p>
            <p>It will appear to the Reader, on Peru≈øal of the following Pages, that this Journal was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to he taken from us by Violence at <hi>Rio Janeiro;</hi> that we have pre≈øerved it, at the Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of our Lives; that there was no Journal kept after the Lo≈øs of the Ship, by any Officers but our≈øelves; and if we had not been careful in making Remarks on each Day's Tran≈øactions, Per≈øons mu≈øt have continued in the Dark, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to all the ≈øub≈øequent Proceedings.</p>
            <p>

It is a very u≈øual Thing to publi≈øh Voyages, e≈øpecially when the Navigators have met with any extraordinary Events. We believe, our Expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, though it was not a Secret, is allowed to be an extraordinary One, and con≈øequently at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with extraordinary Events: Indeed while the Commodore was with us, every thing went well, but when the Squadron ≈øeparated, Things began to have a new Face; after the Lo≈øs of the <hi>Wager,</hi> there was a general Di≈øorder and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øion among the People, who were now no longer implicitly obedient. There were two Seamen par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly, who propogated this Confu≈øion, they ≈øaid they had ≈øuffer'd Ship-wreck in his Maje≈øty's Ship the <hi>Biddeford,</hi> and received no Wages from the Day that the Ship was lo≈øt; that when they were out of Pay, they look'd upon them≈øelves as their own Ma≈øters, and no longer ≈øubjected to Command. The People however were not alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether infected, but ≈øtill continued to pay a duti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Re≈øpect to their Commander; but when the Captain had ra≈øhly ≈øhot Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> (who≈øe Fate the Reader will find particularly related) they then grew very turbulent and unruly, the Captain daily lo≈øt the Love of the Men, who with their Affection lo≈øt their Duty.</p>
            <p>Our confining the Captain is reckoned an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dacious and unprecedented Action, and our not bringing him home with us, is reckon'd wor≈øe;
<pb n="xii" facs="unknown:007859_0012_102DDA4F1BD20648"/>but the Reader will find that Nece≈ø≈øity ab≈øolutely compell'd us to act as we did, and that we had ≈øufficient Rea≈øons for leaving him behind.</p>
            <p>Our Attempt for Liberty in ≈øailing to the Southward through the Streights of <hi>Magellan</hi> with ≈øuch a Number of People, ≈ølow'd in a Long Boat, has been cen≈øur'd as a mad Undertaking: De≈øperate Di≈øea≈øes require de≈øperate Remedies; had we gone to the Northward, there appear'd no Probability of e≈øcaping the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and when we had fallen into their Hands, 'tis not unlikely but they might have employed us as Drudges in their Mines for Life, therefore we rather cho≈øe to encounter all Difficulties than to become Slaves to a mercile≈øs Enemy.</p>
            <p>Some Per≈øons have objected again≈øt our Capaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty for keeping a Journal of this Nature; but ≈øeveral Judges of Maritime Affairs, allow this Work to be exact and regular. We think, Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons with a common Share of Under≈øtanding are capable of committing to Paper daily Remarks of Matters worthy their Ob≈øervation, e≈øpecially of Facts in which they them≈øelves had ≈øo large a Share. We only relate ≈øuch Things as could not po≈ø≈øibly e≈øcape our Knowledge, and what we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually know to be true. We don't ≈øet up for Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turali≈øts and Men of great Learning, therefore have avoided meddling with Things above our Capacity.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xiii" facs="unknown:007859_0013_102DDA51C66EA310"/>
We are al≈øo condemn'd by many for being too bu≈øy and active for Per≈øons in our Stations. There was a Nece≈ø≈øity for Action, and a great deal of it too; and had we been as indolent and regardle≈øs for the Pre≈øervation of the People, as others who were ≈øuperior in Command, there would not have been ≈øo many who were ≈øhipwreck'd in the <hi>Wager,</hi> now in <hi>England</hi> to give a Relation of the Matter.</p>
            <p>The Gentleman who commanded in the Long-Boat on his Arrival before us at <hi>Li≈øbon,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øented us to the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Merchants in a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry vile Light, we were even advi≈øed by ≈øome of our Friends there not to return to our Country, le≈øt we ≈øhould ≈øuffer Death for Mutiny. But when the Gentlemen of the Factory had perus'd our Journal, they found, if there was any Mutiny in the Ca≈øe, the very Per≈øon who accu≈øed us, was the Ringleader and chief Mutineer. We were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of our own Innocence, and determin'd to ≈øee our Country at all Events, being po≈øitive that we have acted to the be≈øt of our Under≈øtandings, in all Re≈øpects, for the Pre≈øervation of our Lives and Liberties; and when our Superiors ≈øhall think proper to call us to an Account, which we expect will be at the Commodore's Arrival, we do not doubt but we ≈øhall clear our≈øelves in ≈øpite of all invidious Reflections and malicious Imputations.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="xiv" facs="unknown:007859_0014_102DDA545CFC5960"/>
It has been hinted to us, as if publi≈øhing this Journal would give Offence to ≈øome Per≈øons of Di≈øtinction. We can't conceive how any Tran≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions relating to the <hi>Wager,</hi> although made e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ≈øo publick, can give Offence to any Great M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>n at Home. Can it be any Offence to tell the World that we were ≈øhip-wreck'd in the <hi>Wager,</hi> when all People know it already? Don't they know that the <hi>Wager</hi> was one of his Maje≈øty's Store-Ships? That we had on Board not only Naval Stores but other Stores of an immen≈øe Value? Don't they al≈øo know that we went abroad with Hopes of acquiring great Riches, but are return'd Home as poor as Beggars? We are guilty of no indecent Reproaches, or unmannerly Reflections; though, it is certain, we cannot but lament our being en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in ≈øo fatal an Expedition. When Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons have ≈øurmounted great Difficulties, it is a Plea≈øure for them to relate their Story; and if we give our≈øelves this Satisfaction, who has any Cau≈øe to be offended? Are we, who have faced Death in ≈øo many Shapes, to be intimidated, le≈øt we ≈øhould give Offence to the‚ÄîLord knows whom? We never ≈øaw a ≈øatyrical Journal in our Lives, and we though that Kind of Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting was the mo≈øt obnoxious to give Offence.</p>
            <p>It has been a Thing u≈øual, in publi≈øhing of Voyages, to introduce abundance of Fiction; and ≈øome Authors have been e≈øteem'd merely for being
<pb n="xv" facs="unknown:007859_0015_102DDA567569FB10"/>marvelous. We have taken Care to deviate from tho≈øe, by having a ≈øtrict Regard to Truth. There are undoubtedly in this Book ≈øome Things which will appear incredible. The Account given of the <hi>Patagonian Indians,</hi> and our own Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre≈ø≈øes, tho' ever ≈øo well atte≈øted, will not ea≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obtain Credit; and People will hardly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that Human Nature could po≈ø≈øibly ≈øupport the Mi≈øeries that we have endured.</p>
            <p>All the Difficulties related we have actually endur'd, and perhaps mu≈øt endure more: Till the Commodore's Arrival we cannot know our Fate; at pre≈øent we are out of all Employment, and have nothing to ≈øupport our≈øelves and Fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, but the Profits ari≈øing from the Sale of our Journal; which perhaps may be the Sum Total we ≈øhall ever receive for our <hi>Voyage to the South-Seas</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">By what is added to this <hi>Second Edition,</hi> it will appear, that after the Arrival of the Captain, the Officers were try'd for the Loft of the Ship, and being all acquitted, except Lieutenant <hi>Beans,</hi> they were paid their Wages to the Time the Ship was wreck'd.</note>.</p>

            <p>ON <hi>Thur≈øday</hi> the 18th of <hi>September</hi> 1740, ≈øailed from St. <hi>Hellens</hi> his Maje≈øty's Ship <hi>Centurion,</hi> Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore <hi>An≈øon,</hi> with the <hi>Glouce≈øter, Pearl, Severn, Wager,</hi> and <hi>Tryal,</hi> and two Store Ships; this Squadron was de≈øign'd round <hi>Cape Horn</hi> into the <hi>South Seas,</hi> to di≈øtre≈øs the <hi>Spaniards</hi> in tho≈øe Parts. The Ships were all in prime Order, all lately rebuilt.

               <hi>Saturday,</hi> the 20th, the <hi>Ram-head</hi> bearing N. by W. half W. di≈øtant four Leagues, the Commodore hoi≈øted his broad Pendant, and was ≈øaluted by every Ship in the Squadron, with thirteen Guns each. This Day join'd Company with us his Maje≈øty's Ships, <hi>Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, Winche≈øter, Chatham, South-Sea-Ca≈øtle,</hi> and <hi>Rye-Galley,</hi> with a large Convoy of Merchant Ships.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thur≈øday,</hi> the 25th, we parted Company with the <hi>Winche≈øter</hi> and the <hi>South-Sea-Ca≈øtle,</hi> with their Convoys, bound for <hi>America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On <hi>Monday,</hi> we parted Company with the <hi>Streights</hi> and <hi>Turky</hi> Convoys.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday, October</hi> the 3d, at Eight in the Morning, we ≈øaw two Brigantines to the South Ea≈øt; the Commodore gave a Signal to chace; at Nine fired two ≈øhot to bring 'em to; at Ten ≈øpoke with the Chace, being two Brigs from <hi>Li≈øbon,</hi> bound for <hi>New-York.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Wedne≈øday</hi> we moored in <hi>Fonchiale</hi> road, ≈øo called from a City of that Name, which

               <hi>Tue≈øday, November</hi> the 4th, Captain <hi>Kidd</hi> our Commander was removed on board the <hi>Pearl,</hi> and the Honourable Captain <hi>Murray</hi> ≈øucceeded him in the <hi>Wager.</hi> Captain <hi>Norris</hi> of the <hi>Glouce≈øter</hi> having obtained Leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to <hi>England,</hi> on account of his ill State of Health, occa≈øioned the above removals.</p>
            <p>While we lay at <hi>Madeira,</hi> we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of ten Sail of Ships crui≈øing off and on, to the We≈øtward; the≈øe Ships were judg'd to be <hi>French,</hi> and had been ≈øeen every Day for a Week before our Arrival: The Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore ≈øent out a Privateer Sloop, but ≈øhe returned the Day following, without ≈øeeing 'em; ≈øo that we can give no Account of 'em.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Wedne≈øday</hi> the 5th, we ≈øailed from <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deira.</hi> On the 20th the <hi>Indu≈øtry</hi> Store-Ship parted Company; and on <hi>Friday</hi> the 28th, by Account, we cro≈øs'd the <hi>Equinoctial.</hi>

On the 18th, the North End of the I≈øland of St. <hi>Catharine</hi> bore N. W. by W. di≈øtant ≈øeven Leagues; and the I≈øland of <hi>Gaul</hi> bore N. W. di≈øtant ≈øix Leagues.</p>
            <p>On the 19th we anchor'd in St. <hi>Catharine</hi>'s Bay in upward of twelve Fathom Water, the I≈øland <hi>Gaul,</hi> on the Coa≈øt of <hi>Brazil,</hi> bearing N. by E. di≈øtant four Leagues.

            <p>On the 27th came in a <hi>Portugue≈øe</hi> Brig from <hi>Rio Janeiro,</hi> for the <hi>Rio Grand:</hi> While we lay here, the People were generally imploy'd in over-hauling the rigging, and getting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board Water.</p>
            <p>On the 17th of <hi>January</hi> 1741, we ≈øailed from St. <hi>Catharine</hi>'s; the Commodore ≈øaluted the Fort with eleven Guns, the Fort returned the ≈øame Number.</p>

            <p>On <hi>Tue≈øday</hi> the 17th of <hi>February,</hi> the <hi>Pearl</hi> join'd the Squadron; and on the 19th we came to Anchor off the river of St. <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lian</hi>'s, on the Coa≈øt of <hi>Patagonia,</hi> St. <hi>Julian</hi>'s

            <p>Captain <hi>Kidd</hi> was heard to ≈øay, a few Days before his Death, That this Voyage, which both Officers and Sailors had engag'd in, with ≈øo much Cheerfulne≈øs and Alacrity, would prove in the End very far from their Expectations, notwith≈øtanding the va≈øt Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure they imagined to gain by it; that it would end in Poverty, Vermin, Famine, Death and De≈øtruction. How far the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's Words were prophetick, will appear in the Cour≈øe of our Journal. Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> ≈øucceeded Captain <hi>Murray</hi> on Board the <hi>Wager.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the 26th of <hi>February</hi> we ≈øent on Board the <hi>Pearl</hi> twelve Butts and two Puncheons of Water; the <hi>Pearl</hi> having, while ≈øhe was ≈øeparated from us, been cha≈øed by five large <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Men of War, the Commander in Chief being di≈øtingui≈øh'd by a red broad <hi>Pendant</hi> with a Swallow's Tail at his Main-top-ma≈øt Head, and a red Flag at his En≈øign-≈øtaff:

            <p>On the 27th, we ≈øent on board the <hi>Pearl</hi> four Puncheons of Water more; at Six in the Morning, the Commodore made Signal to weigh; at Eight weigh'd, and came to Sail; this Day we lo≈øt Sight of the <hi>Glouce≈øter.</hi>

            <p>The 28th, the <hi>Glouce≈øter</hi> came into the Squadron again.</p>

            <p>On the 10th we lo≈øt ≈øight of the <hi>Ann</hi> Pink, on the 12th carried away the rails and Tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Head on both Sides.</p>

            <p>On the 12th we had very hard Gales at We≈øt, with the large≈øt Swell I ever ≈øaw; I was Officer of the Watch (tho' I was Gunner of the Ship, I had the Charge of a Watch during the whole Voyage;) we had our Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board Tacks on Board: Between Six and Seven in the Morning, holding by the Top<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øail Hallyards to Wind-ward, there broke a Sea in the Ship, which carried me over the Wheel, bilg'd the Cutter, and canted her off the Skeets Bottom up athwart the Barge; it likewi≈øe half filled the Long-Boat; the Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwain was for heaving the Cutter over-board, I order'd him to do nothing with her till I had acquainted the Captain, who was then very ill in his Cabbin: The Captain de≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red me to u≈øe all Means to ≈øave the Cutter; at the ≈øame Time I asked Leave to ≈økuttle the Long-Boat, and get the Sprit-≈øail Yard and Jib in, for fear of endangering the Bow≈øprit; which he order'd to be done, and told me, it was a very great Misfortune that he ≈øhould be ill at ≈øuch a Time. When I came from the Captain, I found the Lieutenant on the Deck, got the Cutter in her Place, ≈økuttled
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007859_0041_102DDA90F04B1150"/>the Long-Boat, and got the Sprit-≈øail Yard and Jib-boom in. The Carpenter is ≈øtill a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board the <hi>Glouce≈øter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 13th, under reeft Cour≈øes, the Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board Tacks; the Commodore being on the Weather Quarter, bore down under our Lee, and ≈øpoke, with us. He ask'd the Captain, If the Carpenter was return'd from the <hi>Glou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈øter?</hi> The Captain an≈øwer'd, No; and am ≈øurpriz'd Capt. <hi>Mitchell</hi> ≈øhould detain him, when he knows I mu≈øt want him about my Mizen-ma≈øt. The Commodore told him he would ≈øpeak with the <hi>Glouce≈øter,</hi> and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der him on Board. He then ask'd the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, Why he did not ≈øet the Main-top-≈øail, and make more Sail? Capt. <hi>Cheap</hi> made An≈øwer, My rigging is all gone, and broke fore and aft, and my People almo≈øt all taken ill, and down; but I will ≈øet him as ≈øoon as po≈ø≈øible. The Commodore de≈øired he would, and make what Sail he could after him.</p>
            <p>The 14th, the Carpenter return'd from the <hi>Glouce≈øter,</hi> it being the only Day this Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night a Boat could live in the Sea. As ≈øoon as the Carpenter came on Board, he waited on the Captain, who order'd him to look on the Chain Plates and Chains, and to give his Opinion of the Ma≈øt's going away. The
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007859_0042_102DDA932CD22EA0"/>Carpenter look'd as order'd, and gave Capt. <hi>Cheap</hi> for An≈øwer, That the Chain Plates were all broke. The Captain ≈øhook his Head, and ≈øaid, Carpenter! That is not the Rea≈øon of the Ma≈øt's going away. The Carpenter not willing, as the Ma≈øt was gone, to lay it to any one's Mi≈ømanagement, or to occa≈øion any Unea≈øine≈øs about what was now pa≈øt Prevention, fitted a Cap on the Stump of the Mizen-ma≈øt, got up a lower Studding-≈øame Time fix'd her Main-Yard;
≈øail-Boom, of 40 Feet, and hoi≈øted a Sail to keep the Ship to.</p>
            <p>To-day, being the 19th, and the fine≈øt Day we had in the≈øe Seas, we were employ'd in repairing the rigging; we bent a new Main-Sail, and reeft him, as did the <hi>Ann</hi> Pink; the <hi>Glouce≈øter</hi> at the ≈øame Time fix'd her Main-Yard; the Commodore and <hi>Tryal</hi> keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a-head, and at a con≈øiderable Di≈øtance; between Four and Six at Night ≈øaw the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore's Light. At Six, being reliev'd by the Ma≈øter, he could not ≈øee the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore's Light, tho' it was vi≈øible to every one el≈øe on the Quarter-Deck: The Ma≈øter per≈øi≈øted he could not ≈øee it; on which I went and acqauinted the Captain, who came upon Deck, and ≈øeeing the Light, ask'd the Ma≈øter, Where his Eyes were? This was the la≈øt
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007859_0043_102DDA9514916568"/>Time I ever ≈øaw the Commodore. The Lieutenant having the fir≈øt Watch lo≈øt Sight of him at Nine o'Clock, and at Ten was oblig'd to hand the Fore-Sail; in the doing of which we lo≈øt a Seaman over-board. We ≈øaw the <hi>Glouce≈øter.</hi> and <hi>Ann</hi> Pink a-≈øtern in the Morning; but they were ≈øoon gone a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, and out of Sight.</p>
            <p>The 21≈øt, as I was in the Steward's room, <hi>Jo≈øeph King,</hi> Seaman, came for a Pound of Bread. I heard him ask the Steward, If he thought they would be ≈øerv'd with the ≈øame Quantity of Water as before? Without waiting for an An≈øwer, No, G‚Äîd d‚Äîn 'em; as the Commodore was parted, they ≈øhou'd find the Difference. Not knowing the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence of this, or by whom the Fellow might be ≈øpirited up, I acquainted the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain with the Affair, who order'd me to deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver a Brace of Pi≈øtols charg'd with a Brace of Balls to every Officer in the Ship who wanted 'em, and to take no further Notice of the Matter.</p>

W. by the Compa≈øs: Laid the Ship to for the fir≈øt four Nights; the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this I could not learn. I a≈øk'd the Lieutenant the rea≈øon of our bearing for the Land on a Lee Shore, when we had a fair Wind for our rendezvous, which I had always thought was for the I≈øland of <hi>Juan Ferdinandez.</hi> The Lieutenant told me the rendezvous was alter'd to an I≈øland in the Latitude of 44 S. Upon this I ≈øaid to the Lieutenant, This is a very great Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune to us; that we can do nothing with the Ship in the Condition ≈øhe is in upon a Lee-≈øhore; and am ≈øurpriz'd, that we ≈øhould be oblig'd to go there. The Lieutenant told me, he had ≈øaid every Thing he could to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuade the Captain from it, but found him de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termin'd to go there. The fifth Night, and every Night after, made Sail; the Wind to the We≈øtward. I never reliev'd the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, but I a≈øk'd him, what he thought of a Lee-≈øhore with the Ship in this Condition? he always reply'd, He could not tell. We
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007859_0045_102DDA9952CB7660"/>≈øaw rock-weed in abundance pa≈øs by the Ship. The Honourable <hi>John Byron,</hi> Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhipman, being on the Quarter Deck, ≈øaid, We can't be far off the Land by the≈øe Weeds. The Lieutenant and Mate being by, I ≈øaid, Gentlemen, what can we do with the Ship in the mi≈øerable Condition ≈øhe is in on a Lee-≈øhore? The Leiutenant an≈øwer'd, When<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I have been with the Captain ≈øince our fir≈øt lying to, I always per≈øwaded him to go for <hi>Juan Ferdinandez;</hi> therefore I would have you go to him, he may be per≈øwaded by you, tho' he will not by me. I ≈øaid, If that was the Ca≈øe, my going to him is need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈øs. In a Quarter of an Hour afterwards, the Captain ≈øent for me, and ≈øaid, Gunner! What Longitude have you made? I told him 82. 30. What di≈øtance do you reckon your≈øelf off the Land? I an≈øwer'd, about 60 Leagues: But if the two I≈ølands we ≈øaw are tho≈øe which are laid down in your Chart to lay off <hi>Brewer</hi>'s <hi>Streights,</hi> and the ≈øame Current continues with the We≈øtern ≈øwell, we can't be above a third Part of the Di≈øtance off the Land. The Captain made An≈øwer, as for the Cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, there is no Account to be given for 'em; ≈øometimes they ≈øet one Way, and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times another. I ≈øaid, Sir, very true; but
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007859_0046_102DDA9B3979BAD8"/>as the Ship has been always under reeft Cour≈øes, with the Mizen-Ma≈øt gone, ≈øhe mu≈øt wholly drive to Leeward, and nigher the Land than expected. The Captain then told me, I ≈øuppo≈øe you are not unacquainted of my rendezvous for the I≈øland of <hi>No≈øtra Signora Di Socora,</hi> in the Latitude of 44. I reply'd, Sir, the Ship is in a very bad Condition to come in with the Lee-≈øhore; and if it is po≈ø≈øible to bring the Ship to an Anchor, we ≈øhall never purcha≈øe him again. The Captain an≈øwer'd, I don't de≈øign to come to an Anchor; for there are no Soundings until you come within ≈øeven Leagues of the Land. I purpo≈øe to ≈øtand off and on twenty-four Hours; and if I don't ≈øee the Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dore, or any of the Squadron in that Time, we will go for <hi>Juan Ferdinandez.</hi> To this I ≈øaid, Sir, the Ship is a perfect Wreck; our Mizen-Ma≈øt gone, with our ≈øtanding rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging afore and abaft, and all our People down; therefore I can't ≈øee what we can do in with the Land. The Captain's An≈øwer was, It does not ≈øignify, I am oblig'd and determin'd to go for the fir≈øt rendezvous.</p>
            <p>On the 13th, at Eight in the Morning, the Straps of the Fore-Jeer Blocks broke; reeff'd the Top ropes, and lower'd the Yard; went
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007859_0047_102DDA9D60823848"/>to ≈øtrapping the Blocks. At Nine, the Carpenter going forward to in≈øpect the Chain-Plates, ≈øaw the Land from the Fore-Ca≈øtle; on which he a≈øk'd the Boat≈øwain's Mate, who was by him, If he ≈øaw the Land? He an≈øwer'd, No. The Carpenter ≈øhew'd it him, and he ≈øaw it plain. The Carpenter then ≈øhew'd it to the Lieutenant; but he would not believe it to be Land, becau≈øe it bore N. N. W. and ≈øaid it was impo≈ø≈øible; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he never inform'd the Captain of the Sight of Land, as the Honourable Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> hath heard the Captain ≈øay. At Two in the Afternoon lower'd the Fore-Yard, and hawl'd the Fore-≈øail up. Notwith≈øtanding I was Officer of the Watch, I was oblig'd to go upon the Fore-Yard, where was Mr. <hi>Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell</hi> Mid≈øhipman, one Boat≈øwain's Mate, four Seamen, and the Ma≈øter's Servant; which were all the Hands we could get out of the Ship's Company to a≈ø≈øi≈øt. Whil≈øt on the Yard I ≈øaw the Land very plain, on the Lar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board-beam, bearing N. W. half N. neare≈øt High Land, with Hillocks, and one remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Hommacoe like a Sugar-loaf, very high. At the Sight of Land I came off the Fore-yard, and acquainted the Captain. He imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately gave Orders to ≈øway the Fore-yard
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007859_0048_102DDAA04C4C9710"/>up, and ≈øet the Fore-≈øail; then we wore Ship, with her Head to the Southward. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain coming forward unhappily received a Fall, which di≈ølocated his Shoulder, ≈øo that he was obliged to be put into the Surgeon's Cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bin. Some Time after he ≈øent for the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant and my≈øelf, acquainting us of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity there was for making Sail, as being on a Lee-Shore; therefore de≈øired we would u≈øe our utmo≈øt Endeavours to crowd the Ship off. You ≈øee, Gentlemen, ≈øaid he, my Misfortune will not permit me to continue on the Deck: As for the Ma≈øter, he is not worthy of the Charge of a Watch; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I mu≈øt de≈øire you Mr. <hi>Bulkely,</hi> to be in the Watch with him, and to make but two Watches: Keep a good Look-out, and, if po≈ø≈øible, ≈øet the Main-top-≈øail. Mr. <hi>Beans,</hi> I mu≈øt de≈øire Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> to be with you; and beg you will take all the Care you can. I having the fir≈øt Watch, ≈øet the Main, Fore and Mizen Stay-≈øails; it blew ≈øo hard I found it impo≈ø≈øible to ≈øet the Main-top-≈øail; of which I acquainted the Captain: All the Hands we could mu≈øter in both Watches, Officers included, were but twelve; the re≈øt of the Ship's Company were all ≈øick below: I very often could get no more than three
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007859_0049_102DDAA1E6709B50"/>Seaman in my Watch. The Ship for the≈øe three Weeks hath been no better than a Wreck; the Mizen-ma≈øt gone; the ≈øtanding rigging and Chain-Plates, afore and abaft, mo≈øtly broke and ruin'd. The Top-≈øails now at the Yards are ≈øo bad, that if we attempt to loo≈øe 'em for making Sail, we are in Danger of ≈øplitting 'em; and we have not a ≈øpare Sail in the Ship that can be brought to the Yard without being repair'd. This is the pre≈øent deplorable Situation of the Ship. All the fir≈øt and middle Watch it blow'd and rain'd; and withal ≈øo very dark, that we could not ≈øee the Length of the Ship: For the greate≈øt Part of the Night ≈øhe came up no nearer than S. by W. and S. S. W. At Four in the Morning ≈øhe came up with her Head We≈øt; ≈øo that her Head was then off the Shore.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thur≈øday, May</hi> the 14th, 1741, at Half an Hour pa≈øt Four this Morning, the Ship ≈øtruck abaft on a ≈øunken Rock, ≈øounded fourteen Fathom; but it being impo≈ø≈øible to let go the Anchor Time enough to bring her up, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øurrounded on every ≈øide with rocks (a very di≈ømal Pro≈øpect to behold!) the Ship ≈øtruck a ≈øecond Time, which broke the Head of the Tiller; ≈øo that we were obliged to ≈øteer her with the Main and Fore-≈øheets, by
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007859_0050_102DDAA4441C2B78"/>ea≈øing off one, and hawling aft the other, as ≈øhe came to, or fell off. In a ≈øhort Time after, ≈øhe ≈øtruck, bilged, and grounded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two ≈ømall I≈ølands, where Providence directed us to ≈øuch a Place as we could ≈øave our Lives. When the Ship ≈øtruck it was about Break of Day, and not above a Mu≈øket-≈øhot from the Shore. Launch'd the Barge, Cutter, and Yaul over the Gunnel; cut the Main and Fore-Ma≈øt by the Board, and the Sheet-Anchor from the Gunnel. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ≈øent the Barge on Shore, with Mr. <hi>Snow</hi> the Mate, to ≈øee if the Place was inhabited, and to return aboard directly; but, without any regard to his Duty, or the Pre≈øervation of the Lives of the People, he ≈øtaid a≈øhore. The Barge not returning as expected, the Lieutenant was ≈øent in the Yawl, with Orders to bring off the Barge. The Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant tarried a≈øhore, but ≈øent off the Boat. As ≈øoon as the Boat came on Board, the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, being very iil, was per≈øuaded by the Officers to go a≈øhore: With the Captain went the Land Officers, Mate, and Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhipmen; the Officers remaining on Board were the Ma≈øter, Boat≈øwain, Gunner, and Carpenter: The Boat≈øwain, who was laid up a Month before the Lo≈øs of the Ship, became
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007859_0051_102DDAA63229B490"/>of a ≈øudden very vigorous and active. At Night it blow'd very hard at North, with a great tumbling Sea; we expected every Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the Ship would part, fetching ≈øuch Jirks and Twi≈øtings as ≈øhock'd every Per≈øon aboard, who had the lea≈øt Care for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation of Life; yet, in the di≈ømal Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we were in, we had ≈øeveral in the Ship ≈øo thoughtle≈øs of their Danger, ≈øo ≈øtupid, and in≈øen≈øible of their Mi≈øery, that upon the principal Officers leaving her, they fell into the mo≈øt violent Outrage and Di≈øorder: They began with broaching the Wine in the Laza<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>retto; then to breaking open Cabbins and Che≈øts, arming them≈øelves with Swords and Pi≈øtols, threatning to murder tho≈øe who ≈øhould oppo≈øe or que≈øtion them: Being drunk and mad with Liquor, they plunder'd Che≈øts and Cabbins for Money and other Things of Va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue, cloathed them≈øelves in the riche≈øt Appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel they could find, and imagined them≈øelves Lords, Paramount.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> the 15th the Ship was bilged in the Mid-≈øhips on a great rock; we took Care to ≈øecure ≈øome Powder, Ball, and a little Bread. In the Afternoon, the Carpenter and my≈øelf went a≈øhore with ≈øeveral of tho≈øe imaginary Lords in the rich Attire they had
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007859_0052_102DC6FA5369CD88"/>plunder'd Ye≈øterday; but upon the Pur≈øer and Lieutenant <hi>Hamilton</hi> of Marines pre≈øent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Pi≈øtols to ≈øome of their Brea≈øts, tho≈øe Grandees ≈øuffer'd them≈øelves very quietly to be di≈ørob'd of all their Greatne≈øs, and in a few Minutes look'd like a Parcel of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øported Felons. On our coming a≈øhore, we found the Captain had taken his Lodging in a little Hut, ≈øuppos'd to be built by <hi>Indians;</hi> as for our Parts, we were forced to take Shelter under a great Tree, where we made a large Fire; but it rain'd ≈øo hard, that it had almo≈øt co≈øt us our Lives; an Invalid died that very Night on the Spot. Before I left the Ship I went to my Cabbin for my Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, but could not find it; I believe it is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtroy'd with the re≈øt, for there is not one Journal to be produced; we have good rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon to apprehend there was a Per≈øon employ'd to de≈øtroy them; I afterwards found Part of the Ma≈øter's Journal along ≈øhore, tore to Pieces: Whatever is related in this Book, preceeding the Lo≈øs of the <hi>Wager,</hi> is extracted from a Journal belonging to a Gentleman lately an Officer on Board the <hi>Pearl.</hi> After we lo≈øt ≈øight of the <hi>Pearl,</hi> I was oblig'd to have recour≈øe to my Memory, which I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve has been very faithful to me. From
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007859_0053_102DDAA7EC2E8818"/>the Time we were Ship-wreck'd, the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter and my≈øelf were exceeding careful in writing each Days Tran≈øactions: Had other Per≈øons taken the ≈øame Care, there would be no Nece≈ø≈øity of impo≈øing upon the Publick a partial and incon≈øi≈øtent Narrative, in≈øtead of a faithful relation of Facts.</p>
            <p>On the 16th, the Weather very boi≈øterous, and a great Sea, the Boat≈øwain wanted a Boat; but finding no Appearance of any coming aboard, brought a Quarter-deck Gun, a four Pounder, to bear on the Captain's Hu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This Day, being re≈øolv'd to contrive ≈øomething like a Hou≈øe, to ≈øecure us from the Inclemency of the rain, and Severity of the Weather, we hawl'd up the Cutter, and propping her up, we made a tolerable Habitation. As for Food this I≈øland produces none; nor is there any Vegetable upon it but Cellery, which grows here in abundance, and is of great U≈øe to us, the Men being in general very much troubled with the Scurvy.</p>
            <p>On the 17th of <hi>May,</hi> being <hi>Whit≈øunday,</hi> got ≈øeveral wild Fowls, and plenty of Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, Limpetts, and other Shell-fi≈øh, which we find very refre≈øhing, having ≈øub≈øi≈øted a long Time on nothing but Salt-provi≈øions.</p>

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:007859_0054_102DDAAAD9163DC0"/>
The 18th went on Board the Ship, to ≈øee if it was po≈ø≈øible to come to any Provi≈øions; got out of the Lazaretto two Casks of Flouer and ≈øome Wine, which were very u≈øeful.</p>
            <p>On the 19th went aboard again to ≈øcuttle the Decks, in order to get ≈øome Beef and Pork out of the Hold; we al≈øo ≈øcuttled the Carpenter's Store-room, for Nails and other Things of Service.</p>
            <p>The 20th cut away the Gunnel, to get the Long Boat out; which was done. To-day we found ≈øeveral Men dead, and ≈øome drowned, in the Ship; ≈øuppos'd to have drank till they were not able to get from the Water, as it flowed into the Ship. While we were aboard working on the Wreck, there came a-long ≈øide a Canoe with ≈øeveral <hi>Indians,</hi> bowing and cro≈ø≈øing them≈øelves, giving us to under≈øtand they were inclinable to the <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> religion; we gave 'em out of the Ship two Bales of Cloth, and ≈øent them a≈øhore to the Captain; he gave them Hats, and pre≈øented each of them with a Soldier's Coat. They had Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of the large≈øt and be≈øt Mu≈øcles I ever ≈øaw, or ta≈øted. This Day was the fir≈øt Time of the Boat≈øwain's coming a≈øhore; the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain called him rogue and Villain, and felled him to the Ground with his Cane, ≈øo that he

The Captain, Lieutenant <hi>Hamilton</hi> of Marines, the Surgeon, and Pur≈øer, always appear'd in Arms on the Beach, on the coming a≈øhore of every Boat, in order to prevent the People bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Thing from the Ship in a clande≈øtine Manner; they were ≈øo cautious of any Thing being imbezzled, that they would not ≈øuffer the Boats to go off and work by Night, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding the Moon, Tides, and Fairne≈øs of Weather were more favourable to us by Night than Day; by this we omitted ≈øeveral Opportunities of getting out Provi≈øions, and other u≈øeful Things, which we ≈øhall ≈øhortly ≈øtand in great Need of.</p>
            <p>The 21≈øt, continued to ≈øcuttle between Decks; in getting Nece≈ø≈øaries out of the Ship, found ≈øeveral Men dead.</p>
            <p>The 22d, the <hi>Indians</hi> brought us three Sheep, and ≈øome Mu≈øcles.

            <p>On the 27th, we ≈øcuttled over the Captain's Store-room, got out ≈øeveral Casks of rum and Wine, and brought them a≈øhore. This

We learn from <hi>Nicholas Gri≈øelham,</hi> Seaman, who was pre≈øent and near the Captain all the Time, that as Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> was rowling up a ≈øleep Beach, a Ca≈øk of Pea≈øe, he found it too heavy for him, and left off rowling; the Captain ≈øeeing this, told him, he was drunk, Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> reply'd, With what ≈øhould I get drunk, unle≈øs it be with Water? The Captain then ≈øaid, You Scoundrel, get more Hands, and rowl the Ca≈øk up: <hi>Cozens</hi> called for more Hands, but no People came; with that the Captain ≈øtruck him with his Cane. <hi>Gri≈øelham</hi> likewi≈øe ≈øays, that <hi>Cozens</hi> talked to the Captain about one Capt. <hi>Shelvock;</hi> but the Words he does not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.

When he ≈øpoke this, he was a Pri≈øoner in the Store Tent, and a≈øked the Captain, If he was to be kept there all Night? On the≈øe Provocations, the Captain attempted to ≈øtrike him again; but the Centinel ≈øaid,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:007859_0060_102DDAB634CF68C0"/>he ≈øhould ≈øtrike no Pri≈øoner of his.

            <p>The 8th, Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> and my≈øelf went to the De≈øerters; we find they are determined to go off to the Northward; the rea≈øon of their Stay is the Want of Craft to go off in. They now find them≈øelves mi≈øtaken, they believed at fir≈øt they were on the Main, but are convinced they are four or five Leagues from it, therefore they purpo≈øe to build a Punt out of the Wreck of the Ship: They live on Sea Weed and Shell Fi≈øh; got up one Ca≈øk of Beef, which was brought on Shore with a Ca≈øk of Brandy, found one Ca≈øk of Beef on the rocks.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Tue≈øday</hi> the 9th, I went with the Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor's Mate to the De≈øerters, and ≈øpoke to <hi>William Oram,</hi> a Carpenter, and a very u≈øeful Man, de≈øiring him to return, with a Promi≈øe of Pardon from the Captain: In this Affair I was obliged to Act very ≈øecretly. To-day, Mr. <hi>Cozens,</hi> the Mid≈øhipman, had a Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute with the Surgeon; the latter having

In the Evening the Captain ≈øent for me and the Carpenter to his Tent: We found with the Captain, the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, Pur≈øer, Surgeon, and Lieutenant <hi>Hamilton</hi> of Marines. Here we had a Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øultation, which was chiefly concerning the Di≈øturbances among the People, as well in our Tent as in the re≈øt. Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> and I a≈ø≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red the Captain, that the People in our Tent were generally very well affected to him, and that we never would engage in any Mutiny again≈øt him, or any other Officer that would act for the publick Good, and his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>je≈øty's Service: The Captain ≈øaid, he had no rea≈øon to ≈øu≈øpect us, for we were the only two in the Ship, that he put any Tru≈øt or Confidence in; ≈øtrict Orders were given the Centinel to keep a good Look-out, and have a watchful Eye on the Provi≈øions; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding all this Precaution and Care, there was one third Part of a Barrel of Flour, and half a Barrel of Gunpowder taken away that Night. It is to be ob≈øerved, that this

               <hi>Wedne≈øday</hi> the 10th, This Day, ≈øerving the Provi≈øions, the Boat≈øwain's Servant, a <hi>Portugue≈øe</hi> Boy, talking bad <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> and bringing in the Allowance of Wine, the Boat≈øwain, Mr. <hi>Cozens,</hi> Mid≈øhipman, and the Cook his Me≈ø≈ø-mates, with ≈øome Difficulty, under≈øtood by the Boy's Talk, that one of the Men had his Allowance ≈øtopped; Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> went to know the rea≈øon; the Pur≈øer and he having ≈øome Di≈øpute two or three Days before, the Pur≈øer told him, when he a≈øked for his Wine, that he was come to Mutiny, and, without any further Ceremony, di≈øchar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged a Pi≈øtol at his Head, and would have ≈øhot him, had he not been prevented by the Cooper's canting the Pi≈øtol with his Elbow, at the In≈øtant of its going off; the Captain, and Lieutenant <hi>Hamilton,</hi> hearing the Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the Pi≈øtol, the latter ran out with a Firelock, then called the Captain out of his Tent, telling him that <hi>Cozens</hi> was come to Mutiny; the Captain on this jumped out, a≈øk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing where the Villain was, clapped a cock'd
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:007859_0063_102DDABC1A5685F0"/>Pi≈øtol to Mr, <hi>Cozens</hi>'s Cheek, and precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tately ≈øhot him, without a≈øking any Que≈øtions; the Noi≈øe of the two Pi≈øtols going off, reached our Tent; it was rainy Weather, and not fit for Gunning, ≈øo that we could not imagine the Meaning of it; ≈øoon after we heard Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> was ≈øhot by the Captain: The Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant came to call all Hands to the Captain; I a≈øked if we mu≈øt go armed; the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant an≈øwered, yes; but, on Con≈øideration, I thought better to go without Arms: When we came to the Captain, he acquainted us with what he had done, and told us he was ≈øtill our Commander. The Captain, Pur≈øer, Surgeon, Lieutenants <hi>Hamilton, Ewers,</hi> and <hi>Fielding</hi> of Marines being all armed, I ≈øaid to the Captain, Sir, you ≈øee we are di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed; on this the Captain dropped his Firelock to the Ground, ≈øaying, I ≈øee you are, and have only ≈øent for you, to let you all know I am ≈øtill your Commander, ≈øo let eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Man go to his Tent; accordingly every Man obey'd him. In our Tent we had eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of the ≈øtoute≈øt Fellows that belonged to the Ship; and I believe the Captain, and the Gentlemen above-mentioned, have ≈øome Su≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion of Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> and my≈øelf, believing we can ≈øway mo≈øt of the Seamen on Shore:
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:007859_0064_102DDABDB4989598"/>But I think this Day we have given a Proof of the Sincerity of our Intentions, and our Dete≈øtation of Mutiny, by not appearing in Arms at the report of Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> being ≈øhot; we walked up with the Captain, where we ≈øaw Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> with his Elbow on the Ground re≈øting his right Cheek on the Palm of his Hand, alive, and to Appearance ≈øen≈øible, but ≈øpeechle≈øs; the Captain ordered him to the ≈øick Tent, the Surgeon's Mate dre≈ø≈øed his left Cheek where he was ≈øhot, and felt a Ball about three Inches under his right Eye; the Surgeon refu≈øed dre≈ø≈øing him; this we may impute to his having lately a Quarrel with Mr. <hi>Cozens,</hi> which has been already mentioned. The ≈øhooting of Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> was a very unhappy Affair: the Per≈øon who≈øe Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance was ≈øtopped, made no Complaint to him, he was too officious in the Bu≈øine≈øs, and his preceeding Behaviour, and notorious di≈øre≈øpectful Words to the Captain, might probably make the Captain ≈øu≈øpect his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign was Mutiny; tho' this we mu≈øt aver, that Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> neither on this, or any other Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion, appeared in Arms ≈øince the Lo≈øs of the Ship: However, his Fate laid the Foundation of a great deal of Mi≈øchief which afterwards followed.</p>

               <hi>Thur≈øday</hi> the 11th, moderate Gales at W. N. W. The Carpenter employed in laying the Blocks for the Long-Boat. Dr. <hi>Oakly,</hi> of the Land Forces, was de≈øired to a≈ø≈øi≈øt the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon's Mate, to take the Ball out of Mr. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens</hi>'s Cheek, which he then was inclinable to do; but in the Afternoon finding it not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Captain, refu≈øed to go, as we are informed by the Surgeon's Mate, who de≈øired ≈øome Surgeon might be pre≈øent, to be Witne≈øs of the Operation; the Ball was taken out, and for ≈øome time ≈øuppo≈øed to be lo≈øt, but was afterwards found.</p>
            <p>This Day being the 12th, the Carpenter fini≈øhed the Blocks for lengthening the Long-Boat; in the Morning he went to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's Tent for ≈øome Bolts for the U≈øe of the Long-Boat, where he ≈øaw the Surgeon at the Medicine-Che≈øt, who asked him how that unfortunate Creature did, meaning Mr. <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens;</hi> the Carpenter told him he had not ≈øeen him To-day: The Surgeon then ≈øaid he would have vi≈øited him, but the Captain would not give him Leave. This was looked on as an Act of Inhumanity in the Captain, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed very much to his lo≈øing the Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the People, who≈øe Opinion was, that as Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> was very ≈øtrong and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:007859_0066_102DDAC239A44190"/>with proper A≈ø≈øi≈øtance, he might reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver; the People did not ≈øcruple to ≈øay that the Captain would act a more honourable Part to di≈øcharge another Pi≈øtol at him, and di≈øpatch him at once, than to deny him relief, and ≈øuffer him to langui≈øh in a cold wet Place in Pain and Mi≈øery.</p>
            <p>On the 13th, Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> being, to all out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Appearance, likely to recover, de≈øired he might be removed to our Tent, which was his Place of re≈øidence before this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Accident: We being unwilling to di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oblige the Captain, the Carpenter and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf waited on him; we told him, we were come to ask a Favour, hoping that he would have ≈øo much Mercy and Compa≈ø≈øion on the unhappy Man who was in the ≈øick Tent, as to permit us to remove him to his former Lodging; but the Captain an≈øwer'd, No; I am ≈øo far from it, that, if he lives, I will carry him a Pri≈øoner to the Commodore, and hang him.</p>
            <p>On the 14th, went aboard the Ship, but could do nothing, ≈øhe working ≈øo very much; we brought a≈øhore the Fore-top-≈øail Yard; the Boat went up the river, brought back Abundance of Gee≈øe and Shaggs. Wind at We≈øt.</p>

            <p>On the 17th, the Carpenter at Work on the Long Boat: The Surgeon's Mate this Day took out of Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi>'s Cheek a Ball much ≈ølatted, and a Piece of Bone, ≈øuppo≈øed to be Part of the Upper Jaw, which was de≈øired by Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> to be deliver'd to me; I receiv'd it, with the fir≈øt Ball mention'd to have been lo≈øt.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thur≈øday</hi> the 18th, the Carpenter cut the Long-Boat in two, and lengthen'd her eleven Feet ten Inches and half by the Keel.</p>

            <p>The 22d, the Carpenter went with the Boat up the Bay to ≈øeek the <hi>Indians,</hi> but ≈øaw nothing of them; at Night the Boat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn'd, the People having ≈øhot. Abundance of wild Fowl.</p>
            <p>The 23d, the Lieutenant went with the Boat, and found the <hi>Indians</hi> ju≈øt come from the Place where they catch Seal; their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes were loaded with Seal, Sheep, and Oil.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Thur≈øday</hi> the 25th, the Wind at W. N. W. and rainy Weather; ≈øaw the <hi>Indians</hi> coming towards us in their Canoes; but the De≈øert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers ≈øettling where they took their Habitation when fir≈øt we ≈øaw 'em, by their rowing, we
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:007859_0069_102DDAC8447C4CD8"/>thought they were de≈øign'd to go there; and knowing the De≈øerters intended to take one of their Canoes to go over to the Main, we therefore launch'd the Yawl and went off to them; there were five Canoes of 'em, laden with Seal, Shell-fi≈øh, and four Sheep; they brought with 'em their Wives and Children, ≈øo that in all they were about fifty in Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; they hawl'd their Canoes up, and built four Wigwams, which they cover'd with the Bark of Trees and Seal-≈økins; we ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd by this they had an Intention to ≈øettle with us; they are a very ≈øimple and inoffen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øive People, of a low Stature, flat nos'd, with their Eyes ≈øunk very deep in their Heads; they live continually in Smoak, and are never without a Fire, even in their Canoes; they have nothing to cover their Nakedne≈øs, but a Piece of an old Blanket, which they throw over their Shoulders: We always ≈øee 'em in this Manner, notwith≈øtanding we cloath 'em whenever they come to us. By the Cro≈ø≈øes ≈øet up in many Parts of the Land, one would think they had ≈øome Notion of the <hi>Romi≈øh</hi> religion: We can't make 'em under≈øtand us by any Speech, nor by our Signs; we ≈øhow'd 'em a looking Gla≈øs; when they ≈øaw the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øentation of them≈øelves, they ≈øeem'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maz'd,

            <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> the 28th, in the Afternoon, about twelve of the <hi>Indian</hi> Women went off in their Canoes: We thought they were gone to get Mu≈øcles, but ≈øoon ≈øaw 'em diving; which we imagin'd was for Pieces of Beef or Pork that came out of the Wreck; but when they came a≈øhore, we found they had been only diving for Sea-Eggs. The Women among tho≈øe People ≈øeem to take more Pains for the Provi≈øions of Life than the Men; the latter having little to do but to provide Wood, and indulge them≈øelves by the Fire, while the Women go every Tide a Fi≈øhing. To-day we kill'd two <hi>Indian</hi> Sheep.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> the 29th, launch'd the Yawl to go with the <hi>Indians</hi> to ≈øhew us where they get the Mu≈øcles; but being too late for the Tide, we came away without any: The Captain ≈øent to our Tent two Quarters of Mutton; the Carpenter daily at Work on the Long-Boat.

            <p>On the 30th, the <hi>Indian</hi> Women went again for Sea Eggs, and brought a great Quantity, with Abundance of white Mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gots

               <hi>Saturday, Augu≈øt</hi> the 1≈øt, hard Gales at N. W. with rain and Hail. This Day put to an Allowance of Flour, one Quarter of a Pound a Man <hi>per Diem,</hi> and one Pint of Wine; tho≈øe who like Brandy, to have half a Pint in Lieu of Wine. We have now in a manner nothing to live on but what we pick up along the Shore: The Ship's Company agree to go through the <hi>Streights</hi> of <hi>Magellan.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Sunday</hi> the 2d, This Morning found the Store Tent robbed of Brandy; filled up all the ullago Ca≈øks; picked up about the rocks Abundance of Clams, a Shell-fi≈øh not unlike our Cockles: The≈øe Fi≈øh are at pre≈øent the Support of our Life. The People are now very quarrel≈øome and di≈øcontented.</p>

               <hi>Monday</hi> the 3d, this Day having fine Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (which is a Prodigy in the Place) launched the Boat, and went about the rocks and I≈ølands on Di≈øcovery. This Day we al≈øo moved into our new Hou≈øe, it being a very commodious Habitation, exceeding well thatched; in this Dwelling there are Cabbins for fourteen People, which are covered in≈øide and out with broad Cloath: This is a rich Hou≈øe, and, in ≈øome Parts of the World,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:007859_0079_102DDADCB7646F68"/>would purcha≈øe a pretty E≈øtate; there are ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral hundred Yards of Cloth about it, be≈øides the Curtains and Linings, which are Shalloon and Camblet; in ≈øhort, con≈øidering where we are, we cannot de≈øire a better Habitation. The People fall into Di≈øputes concerning the Boat, where we are to proceed with her, when ≈øhe is built and ready for going off. It is the Opinion of the Navigators, that going through the <hi>Streights</hi> of <hi>Magellan</hi> is the ≈øafe≈øt and only Way to pre≈øerve Life and Liberty: The Arti≈øts, who have worked the Bearings and Di≈øtance, are very pre≈ø≈øing that it ≈øhould be moved to the Captain, purpo≈øing to have their rea≈øons drawn up, and ≈øigned by all who are willing to go that Way, and to be delivered to the Captain for his Opinion: upon this there was a Paper drawn up, and as ≈øoon as the People heard it, they came flocking to ≈øign fir≈øt, crying all aloud for the <hi>Streights,</hi> ≈øeeming overjoyed, as if they were going to <hi>England</hi> directly, without any Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction or Trouble, but there mu≈øt be a great deal of Hard≈øhip to be encountered before we arrive at our native Country: This Paper was ≈øigned by all the Officers on the Spot, except the Captain, Lieutenant, Pur≈øer, and Surgeon, and by all the Seamen in general, except the Captain's Steward.</p>

               <hi>Thur≈øday</hi> the 6th, hard Gales at W. S. W. and rainy Weather. At Noon went with Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> to Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi>'s Tent, to have ≈øome farther Conference for our future Deliverance. While we were there, the Captain ≈øent his Service to Capt. <hi>Cheap</hi> for a Pair of Pocket-Pi≈øtols, his own Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, which had been refu≈øed him on his reque≈øt ≈øome Time before.

Then think on the Di≈øtance to be run afterwards on the other Side the <hi>Streights,</hi> with the Wind always again≈øt us, and where no Water is to be

I an≈øwer'd, Sir, you ≈øay it is above one hundred and ≈øixty Leagues to the <hi>Streights;</hi> but let the Navigators work it, and they will find it not above ninety Leagues; your≈øelf and Lieutenant are undoubtedly Navigators and Judges, therefore will certainly find it as I ≈øay. Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> acquainted him, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his Calculation, the Ve≈ø≈øel would carry a Month's Water at a Quart a Man <hi>per Diem;</hi> and, Sir, do you con≈øider, after running a-long Shore to the Northward this Side the Land, that we have one hundred Leagues to run right out to Sea to the I≈øland of <hi>Juan Ferdinandez;</hi> and five hundred Chances to one, if we meet the Commodore there, or any of the Squadron; nor do we know but the Commodore may have ≈øhared the ≈øame Fate with our≈øelves, or perhaps wor≈øe?

Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> ≈øaid, Sir, what ≈øhall we do with a Ve≈ø≈øel, without Provi≈øions, for ninety Souls? The Captain an≈øwer'd, We will take a Ve≈ø≈øel loaden with Flour from <hi>Chili,</hi> there being a great many Trading Ve≈ø≈øels that Way; and then we will proceed through the <hi>Streights of Magellan.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mins</hi> ≈øaid, How ≈øhall we take a Ve≈ø≈øel with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Guns not having any but Mu≈økets, and our Enemies know as well as our≈øelves, that we have a Squadron in the≈øe Seas, therefore undoubtedly are well arm'd, and keep a good Look-out.

I allow that, ≈øays the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and we may ≈øave our own; but how do you know whether we may not meet Enemies in the <hi>Streights?</hi> I reply'd to the Captain, We can have no Enemies to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter there but <hi>Indians</hi> in their Canoes, and tho≈øe we can ma≈øter at our Plea≈øure. The Captain then ≈øeem'd to countenance our Opinion again, and ≈øaid, When we come to <hi>St. Julian</hi>'s we ≈øhall be ≈øure of Salt in Plenty for our Provi≈øions, without which our Fowls will not keep above two or three Days: Be≈øides, when we come to the river <hi>Plate,</hi> we may meet with a Prize, they not being acquainted with any <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Ve≈ø≈øel like ours, with Schooner Sails; by which Means we may run up the river, and take a larger

The Captain ≈øaid, That's true, and I can get Bills of Credit in any Part of <hi>Brazil;</hi> be≈øides, the People may be ≈øeparated, ≈øome in the <hi>Flota,</hi> and ≈øome in other Ships; with le≈øs Hands we may go to <hi>Barbados.</hi> Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> told him, We might venture to <hi>England</hi> with twelve Hands.

The Captain ≈øaid, I knew nothing of his being acquainted with it, till Mr. <hi>Bulkeley</hi> told me Ye≈øterday; but at the ≈øame Time, Mr. <hi>Beans,</hi> I expect you will be the fir≈øt that will ≈øign the Paper. I ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd the Captain meant our Paper, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately an≈øwer'd with ≈øome Warmth, As he had refus'd ≈øigning at fir≈øt, and at the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:007859_0088_102DDAEF6F5CD508"/>≈øame Time agreed to the Propo≈øal, that I had ≈øign'd ≈øo clo≈øe, that there was no room left for his Name, and now it was too late for him to ≈øign. The Captain ≈øurpriz'd me, by ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I don't mean your Paper. I told him, Any other, which ≈øhould be contrary to ours, would never be ≈øign'd by us. Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> ≈øaid to the Captain, Sir, 'tis all owing to you that we are here; if you had con≈øulted your Officers, we might have avoided this Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; con≈øidering the Condition the Ship was in, ≈øhe was not fit to come in with the Land, all our Men being ≈øick, and not above three Seamen in a Watch; ≈øuppo≈øe the Ma≈øt had gone by the Board, as was every Moment expected. The Captain made An≈øwer, Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen, you do not know my Orders, there never were any ≈øo ≈øtrict given to a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander before; and had I but two Men li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving be≈øides my≈øelf, I mu≈øt, and was obliged to go to the fir≈øt rendezvous, which was the I≈øland of <hi>No≈øtra Senhora di Socora:</hi> I was obliged to go there at all Events.

               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:007859_0089_102DDAF157F938E8"/>that at the ≈øame Time tho≈øe Orders were ≈øo far di≈øcretional, that if the Squadron was di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled, Care was to be taken not to endanger his Maje≈øty's Ships. Yes, that (≈øays the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain) was ≈øettled at <hi>St. Julian</hi>'s: Notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding what has been ≈øaid, Gentlemen, I am agreeable to take any Chance with you, and to go any Way; but would have you con≈øider of it, and defer your Determination till all is ready to go off the Spot. I then told the Captain, You have known, Sir, from the Time you ≈øaw the Propo≈øal, that the People are unea≈øy, and the Work is at a Stand, and in this Situation Things will be until this Affair is ≈øettled; therefore the ≈øooner you re≈øolve, the better. The Captain re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, I de≈øign to have a Con≈øultation among my Officers: Have you any more Objections to make? I an≈øwer'd, Yes, Sir, one more; which is, When you go from hence, you are not to weigh, come to an Anchor, or alter Cour≈øe, without con≈øulting your Officers. The Captain ≈øaid, Gentlemen, I was your Commander till the Ship parted, or as long as any Stores or Provi≈øions were getting out of her. We told him, we had always taken Care to obey his Orders in the ≈øtricte≈øt Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner; which he allow'd us to have done; and
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:007859_0090_102DDAF43627E828"/>he added, You were the Officers that I placed my whole Dependence in. We an≈øwer'd, Sir, we will ≈øupport you with our Lives, at long as you ≈øuffer rea≈øon to rule; and then we parted. After this Con≈øultation the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ≈øeldom came out of his Tent, which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion'd great Di≈øturbances among the People.</p>

               <hi>Friday</hi> the 7th, the Wind at W. N. W. with rain. This Day the Navigators work'd the Bearings and Di≈øtance along Shore, from one Place to another, to know the true Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: Hereupon it was agreed to proceed through the <hi>Streights of Magellan,</hi> according to Sir <hi>John Narborough</hi>'s Directions, which give us great Encouragement to go that Way. Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi> draw'd his Men up, and di≈ømi≈øs'd 'em again. Great Unea≈øine≈øs among the People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> the 8th, this Morning went to the Lieutenant, for him to acquaint the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain all his Officers were ready to give ≈øuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient rea≈øons for going through the <hi>Streights of Magellan,</hi> de≈øiring a Con≈øultation might be held in the Afternoon. At Three o'Clock the Captain ≈øent for me and Mr. <hi>Cummins;</hi> when we came, the Ma≈øter and Bort≈øwain were ≈øent for, but they were gone in Search of Sub≈øi≈øtence, as Limpets, Mu≈øcles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
               <pb n="59" facs="unknown:007859_0091_102DDAF5D2FB2950"/>The Captain ≈øaid, Gentlemen, I don't doubt but you have con≈øider'd upon the Bu≈øine≈øs you are come about; therefore I am determin'd to take my Fate, with you, or where the Spirit of the People leads, and ≈øhall u≈øe my be≈øt Endeavours for their Pre≈øervation; but I am afraid of meeting contrary Winds, for after the Sun has cro≈øs'd the Line we mu≈øt expect to meet 'em. I made An≈øwer, By all Accounts, the Wind hangs from N. W. to the S. W. above three Parts of the Year; which is in our Favour. Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> told him, There was fre≈øh Water to be got as well on one Coa≈øt as the other; and if Sir <hi>John Narborough</hi>'s Treatment was ≈øo ill in a profound Peace, what mu≈øt we expect in a Time of open War? The Captain ≈øaid, I am afraid very bad. Then Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> ≈øpoke in this Manner to the Captain: Sir, I always took you for an honourable Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and I believe you to be ≈øuch; on your Honour, Sir, I beg you will give the true Sentiments of your Mind, whether thro' the <hi>Streights</hi> is not the ≈øure≈øt and ≈øafe≈øt Way to pre≈øerve our Lives, notwith≈øtanding we have a Thou≈øand Difficulties to encounter with any Way? The Captain an≈øwer'd, I really think going to the Northward is the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:007859_0092_102DDAF76A118418"/>≈øafe≈øt Way; for ≈øuppo≈øe we ≈øhould be drove off to Sea, when on the other Side the Land, what is to be done then? I ≈øaid, Sir, it is our Bu≈øine≈øs to keep the Shore, to prevent all Accidents that may happen that Way. Then Lieutenant <hi>Beans</hi> made an Objection, Suppo≈øe you have the Wind blowing right in, and a tumbling Sea, ≈øo as to endanger the Boat, what are we to do? I made An≈øwer, Sir, If you remember, when we were riding at <hi>St. Juli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an</hi>'s, it blow'd a very hard Gale of Wind right in from the Sea, yet, even then, the Sea did not run ≈øo high as to endanger a Boat riding at Anchor: Another In≈øtance I bring you from <hi>St. Catherine</hi>'s, when we had ≈øuch hard Gales, that the <hi>Tryal</hi> lo≈øt her Ma≈øts, and the <hi>Pearl</hi> ≈øeparated from the Squadron; yet, at that Time, there was no Sea compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable to what we have met with this Side the Land. The Lieutenant allow'd this to be Fact. Then the Captain ≈øaid, I will allow you to have Water at <hi>Port De≈øire;</hi> but do you con≈øider the lengthening your Di≈øtance, by keeping along Shore, and rounding every Bay, and ≈øome of tho≈øe Bays are very deep. I told him, That undoubtedly there was Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all along the Coa≈øt, and that we had no Bu≈øine≈øs to round the Bays, but to ≈øteer from
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:007859_0093_102DC6F66F8CD618"/>one Head-land to the other. Then Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant <hi>Beans</hi> made a ≈øecond Objection, Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe we are forced into a Bay, and Shoal-Water? I an≈øwer'd, We ≈øhould always have a Boat a-head, and our Draught of Water will not be above four or five Feet at mo≈øt; and if we ≈øhould be ≈øo unfortunate as to lo≈øe our Boat, we mu≈øt keep the Lead a going. The Lieutenant reply'd, That was true, and there could not be a great deal of Difficulty in it. This was the only Time the Lieutenant ever ≈øpoke in Publick on the Affair; he always allow'd, when ab≈øent from the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, that going through the <hi>Streights</hi> was the be≈øt Way; but in the Captain's Pre≈øence he ≈øided with him, and was for going to the Northward.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday</hi> the 9th, at Three this Afternoon, I went with Mr. <hi>Cummins,</hi> the Ma≈øter, and Boat≈øwain, as de≈øir'd, to the Captain, to give him our Opinions, believing, going thro' the <hi>Streights</hi> the ≈øure≈øt Way to pre≈øerve Life: It was therefore agreed, That if the Wind did not ≈øet in again≈øt us, at the Sun's Cro≈ø≈øing the Line, that the Captain would go that Way. The Captain ask'd every Man's Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and found the People unanimous for the <hi>Streights of Magellan.</hi> To-day, being
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:007859_0094_102DDAFB9CBB5CA8"/>fair Weather, launch'd the Yawl to go a Fowling; ≈øhot ≈øeveral Gee≈øe, Ducks, Shaggs, and Sea-pies. Heel'd the Long-Boat for planking.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> the 10th, Wind at N. and N.N.W. rainy Weather. Eat Slaugh and Sea-weed fry'd with Tallow-Candles, which we pick'd up along Shore; this we reckon at pre≈øent exceeding good Eating, having nothing to live on but a Quarter of a Pound of Flour a Man <hi>per</hi> Day, and what we can get off the rocks; for many Days the Weather has been ≈øo bad, that we have not been able to ≈øtir abroad, though almo≈øt ≈øtarv'd for want of Food.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tue≈øday</hi> the 11th, hard Gales at S. W. with heavy rains. This Afternoon the People came in Arms to acquaint us of the Stores being robbed; they therefore wanted our Con≈øent for moving the Stores to our Tent; on which we de≈øir'd they would de≈øi≈øt from offering any Violence; we told 'em of the ill Con≈øequence of Mutiny, which, as we al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways abhorr'd, we took all imaginable Care to prevent: The People, on our Per≈øua≈øions, in≈øtantly quitted their Arms. The Captain pre≈øently ≈øent for me and Mr. <hi>Cummins,</hi> to acquaint us with what had happen'd: He
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:007859_0095_102DDAFDDE34C5D8"/>told us, the Pur≈øer accidentally coming by, ≈øaw the Pri≈øoner, <hi>Rowland Cru≈ø≈øet,</hi> a Marine, crawling from the Bu≈øhes, and from under the Store-Tent, and found on him upwards of a Day's Flour for Ninety Souls, with one Piece of Beef under his Coat, and three Pieces more, which were conceal'd in the Bu≈øhes, to carry off when an Opportunity offer'd; and the Centry, <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> his Me≈øs-mate, a Marine, undoubtedly was privy to the robbery. The Captain farther ≈øaid, We have nothing to do with them; but I ≈øhall ≈øend to Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi> to in≈øi≈øt on a Court-Martial: I really think, that for rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing the Store-Tent (which, in our pre≈øent Circum≈øtances, is ≈øtarving the whole Body of People) the Pri≈øoners de≈øerve Death. This was not only the Captain's Opinion, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the Sentiments of every Per≈øon pre≈øent. After we parted from the Captain, we were ≈øent for by Capt. <hi>Pemberton:</hi> He acquainted us, he would go as far as the Martial Law would allow him, and in Conjunction with the Sea-Officers: I look (≈øaid he) on the Lieutenant as nothing, and the Captain in the ≈øame Light: As for you two (meaning the Gunner and Carpenter) I confide in, and ≈øhall have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to your Opinions. When the Articles
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:007859_0096_102DDB0088C21890"/>of War were read, we found their Crime did not touch Life, but that they were to ≈øuffer Corporal Puni≈øhment. Whil≈øt Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> was laying open the Nature of their Guilt, and the ill Con≈øequence of Lenity in the Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cum≈øtances we were in, I propos'd a Way, next to Death; which was, if judg'd proper by Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi> and Captain <hi>Cheap,</hi> to carry them off to an I≈øland where the Ship parted, there being Mu≈øcles, Limpets, and Clams in Abundance, and no want of Water, and there to be left till we ≈øhould be ready for ≈øailing; and, to ≈øtrike a Terror in all for the future, that if any Man ≈øhould be guilty of the like Offence, without any re≈øpect of Per≈øon, he ≈øhould ≈øhare the ≈øame Fate. This Propo≈øal was approved of by both the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains. At Night Lieutenant <hi>Beans</hi> ≈øurpriz'd us with a new kind of Propo≈øal we little dreamt of, which was, to have a proper Place of Devotion to perform Divine Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice in every Sabbath-Day: For this Sacred Office our Tent was judg'd the mo≈øt commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dious Place. The Duty of publick Prayer had been entirely neglected on board, though every Seaman pays Four-pence per Month towards the Support of a Mini≈øter; yet De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>votion, in ≈øo ≈øolemn a Manner, is ≈øo rarely
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:007859_0097_102DDB0276818978"/>perform'd that I know but one In≈øtance of it during the many Years I have belong'd to the Navy. We believe religion to have the lea≈øt Share in this Propo≈øal of the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant. If our Tent ≈øhould be turn'd into a a Hou≈øe of Prayer, and this Project takes, we may, perhaps, in the Mid≈øt of our Devotion, be ≈øurpriz'd, and our Arms taken from us, in order to fru≈øtrate our De≈øigns, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our return to <hi>England</hi> through the <hi>Streights of Magellan,</hi> or any other Way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedne≈øday</hi> the 12th, hard Gales from S.W. to W. with heavy Showers of Hail and rain. Serv'd out Provi≈øions To-day, a Piece of Beef for four Men; ≈øome Time pa≈øt we have had but a Quarter of a Pound of Flour per Man per Day, and three Pieces of Beef; we live chiefly on Mu≈ø≈øles, Limpits, and Clams, with Saragraza and Thromba; one is a green broad Weed, common on the rocks in <hi>England;</hi> the other is a round Sea-Weed, ≈øo large, that a Man can ≈øcarce gra≈øp it; it grows in the Sea, with broad Leaves; this la≈øt we boil, the Saragraza we fry in Tallow; in this Manner we ≈øupport Life: Even tho≈øe Shell-Fi≈øh and Weeds we get with great Difficulty; for the Wind, the rain, and Coldne≈øs of the Cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate in this Sea≈øon, are ≈øo extremely ≈øevere,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:007859_0098_102DDB04703998A8"/>that a Man will pau≈øe ≈øome Time whether he ≈øhall ≈øtay in his Tent and ≈øtarve, or go out in Que≈øt of Food.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> the 14th, very hard Gales at W. and N. W. with Showers of rain and Hail, which beat with ≈øuch Violence again≈øt a Man's Face, that he can hardly with≈øtand it; however, one of our Me≈øs-mates To-day ≈øhot three Gulls and a Hawk; which gave us a very elegant repa≈øt. This Day was held a Court-Martial on the Centry who was believ'd confederated with the Marine that robbed the Store-Tent: Sentence was pa≈øs'd on 'em to receive ≈øix hundred La≈øhes each: Captain <hi>Cheap,</hi> not thinking the Puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment adequate to the Crime, cut 'em ≈øhort of their Allowance; ≈øo that they have now but half the Provi≈øions they had before: The Day following the Offenders receiv'd Two Hundred La≈øhes each, as Part of their Puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We hawl'd the Long-Boat higher up, for fear the Sea ≈øhould wa≈øh the Blocks from under her. We have found out a new Way of managing the Slaugh; we fry it in thin Batter with Tallow, and u≈øe it as Bread.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday</hi> the 16th, Fre≈øh Gales of Wind at S. W. with heavy Showers of Hail: The People generally complain of a Malady in
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:007859_0099_102DDB0664727D78"/>their Eyes; they are in great Pain, and can ≈øcarce ≈øee to walk about. The la≈øt Tide flowed nine Feet perpendicular; To-day we picked up Shell-Fi≈øh in Abundance, with Pieces of Beef and Pork. The Pri≈øoners re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived two Hundred La≈øhes more.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tue≈øday</hi> the 18th, this Day the Carpenter, who has all along been indefatigable in working about the Long-Boat, ≈øaw one of the Seamen cutting up an Anchor Stock for Fire-Wood, which had been de≈øigned for a particular U≈øe for the Boat; at Sight of the Fellow's Folly be could not contain him≈øelf: This Affair, added to the little Concern and intollerable Indifference that appeared in the Generality of the People, for ≈øome Time impaired his Under≈øtanding, and made him delirious; all po≈ø≈øible Methods are u≈øed to re≈øtore him, as he is the only Man, who, through the A≈ø≈øi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Providence, can compleat the Means of our Deliverance.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedne≈øday</hi> the 19th, The Carpenter was ≈øo much recovered, that he went to work as u≈øual; at Night, the Lieutenant acquainted us, that the Captain de≈øired to ≈øpeak with the Carpenter and me To-morrow at Noon, to con≈øult what ≈øhould be done with the Two Pri≈øoners, having received but Four Hundrrd
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:007859_0100_102DDBB8A524AAC0"/>La≈øhes out of the Six, to which they were ≈øentenced by a Court-Martial, the other Two Hundred being remitted by their own Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thur≈øday</hi> the 20th, We waited on the Captain, who acquainted us with what the Lieutenant had mentioned la≈øt Night relating to the Pri≈øoners: We told him the People were very unea≈øy about this Mitigation of the Puni≈øhment inflicted on them by a Court Martial; therefore it was agreed they ≈øhould provide for them≈øelves as well as they could; but to have no Sort of Provi≈øions out of the Store-Tent for the future.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> the 22d, we begun upon ≈øeveral Contrivances to get Provi≈øions, ≈øuch as build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Punts, Ca≈øk-Boats, Leather-Boats, and the like.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Sunday</hi> the 23d, The Store-Tent was again robbed, and, on Examination, was found a Deficiency of Twelve Days Brandy for Ninety Men: The Lieutenant, my≈øelf, and Carpenter went to the Captain to con≈øult ≈øome Way which might effectually prevent tho≈øe villainous Practices for the future; the Captain de≈øired us to make a nice Enquiry into this robbery, being determined to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict the ≈øevere≈øt Puni≈øhment on the Offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders;
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:007859_0101_102DDB08AA01EBE8"/>tho' it would give him the greate≈øt Concern if any innocent Per≈øon ≈øhould ≈øuffer.

               <hi>Thur≈øday</hi> the 27th, The Di≈øturbances in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øe among the People; we plainly ≈øee there is a Party rai≈øed to go to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward; we went to the Lieutenant, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øulted with him what was to be done in the pre≈øent Exigence; my≈øelf being reckoned the Projector of the Scheme for going through the <hi>Streights</hi> was threatened to be ≈øhot by <hi>Noble</hi> the Quarter-Ma≈øter; After having ≈øome Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe with the Lieutenant, he told me, If I would draw up a Paper for the Captain to ≈øign, in order to ≈øatisfy the People, that he would go the Southward, and every Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer to have a Copy of it to ju≈øtify him≈øelf in <hi>England,</hi> it would be as proper a Method as we could take.

WHEREAS upon a General Con≈øul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, it has been agreed to go from this Place through the <hi>Streights of Magellan,</hi> for the Coa≈øt of <hi>Brazil,</hi> in our Way for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> We do, notwith≈øtanding, find the People ≈øeparating into Parties, which mu≈øt con≈øequently end in the De≈øtruction of the whole Body; and as al≈øo there have been great robberies committed on the Stores, and every Thing is now at a Stand; therefore, to prevent all future Frauds and Animo≈øities, we are unanimou≈øly agreed to proceed as a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned.</p>
            <p>This Paper was delivered to the Lieutenant, who ≈øaid that he was ≈øure the Captain would ≈øign it; but in ca≈øe of refu≈øal, he ≈øhould be confin'd for ≈øhooting Mr. <hi>Cozens,</hi> and he would take the Command on him≈øelf: And, to prevent further Di≈øturbances, the Pur≈øer, as he much conver≈øed with the rebels, it is agreed by the Body of Officers, to ≈øend him off the I≈øland, for acting ≈øo contrary to his Duty, in Contempt of the Articles of War, the Laws of his Country, and the known rules of the Navy. It was likewi≈øe agreed, that any Per≈øon who engaged him≈øelf in
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:007859_0104_102DDB0FD9F4AB28"/>rai≈øing Parties, ≈øhould be di≈øarm'd. By this Day's Proceedings, we thought the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant a Gentleman of re≈øolution; but the Words and Actions of People do not always concur.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> the 28th, To-day the Officers and People all appear'd in Arms. The Ma≈øter, Boat≈øwain, Gunner, and Carpenter, with Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> Mate, and Mr. <hi>Cambell,</hi> Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhipman, went into the Captain's Tent, the Lieutenant being with him. As ≈øoon as the Officers were ≈øeated, a Con≈øultation was held concerning <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Butler</hi>'s robbing the Store-Tent; they were ≈øentenced to be tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øported to the Main, or ≈øome I≈øland. As ≈øoon as this Affair was over, we talk'd to the Captain of the Unea≈øine≈øs among the People; that there had been a long Time a vi≈øible In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude among 'em, and that we could not help ≈øeeing there were Schemes form'd to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtruct our De≈øign in going to the Southward. The Captain an≈øwer'd, Gentlemen, it is Time enough to think of this when we are ready to go off: Have not I told you before, that I do not care which Way I go, Southward or Northward? I will take my Fate with you. Every Body now expected the Lieutenant to reply, e≈øpecially after the Zeal he expre≈øs'd
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:007859_0105_102DDB121C0FC6E0"/>him≈øelf with the Day before; but he ≈øat ≈øpeechle≈øs, without any regard to the Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the People, or to his own Propo≈øals. Finding he did not move in the Affair, I took out the Paper which was agreed to by the Lieutenant and the re≈øt of the Officers, and read it to the Captain, and ask'd him to ≈øign it; which he ≈øtrenuou≈øly oppos'd and ≈øeem'd very much enrag'd that it ≈øhould be propos'd to him. Upon this we dropt the Matter, and began to di≈øcour≈øe concerning the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions: We thought it nece≈ø≈øary, that ten Weeks Sub≈øi≈øtence ≈øhould be ≈øecur'd to carry with us, and that the Liquor ≈øhould be buried under Ground; but he gave us no An≈øwer. Finding no relief here, we went to Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi>'s Tent, to con≈øult with him what we ≈øhould do in the pre≈øent Exigence. On our coming out from the Captain, we ≈øaw a Flag hoi≈øted on Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi>'s Tent, the Captain him≈øelf ≈øeated in a Chair, ≈øurrounded by the People. On ≈øeeing this, all the Officers pre≈øent at the Con≈øultation, except the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant, went over to Captain <hi>Pemberton.</hi> Here it was agreed, in Ca≈øe the Captain per≈øi≈øted to refu≈øe ≈øigning the Paper, to take the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand from him, and to give it the Lieutenant, according to the Lieutenant's own Propo≈øal.
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:007859_0106_102DDB13B5DAE938"/>At the ≈øame Time Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi> told the People, he would ≈øtand by 'em with his Life, in going through the <hi>Streights of Magellan,</hi> the Way propos'd in the Paper. The People gave three Cheers, crying aloud for <hi>England.</hi> The Captain hearing the Noi≈øe, got out of Bed to his Tent Door, and call'd the People, enquiring what they wanted; then ≈øent for all the Officers: He was then told, ≈øince he refus'd ≈øigning the Paper, and had no regard to the Safety of our Provi≈øions, the People unanimou≈øly agreed to take the Command from him, and transfer it to the Lieutenant. Hearing this, with an exalted Voice, Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> ≈øays, Who is he that will take the Command from me? Addre≈ø≈øing him≈øelf to the Lieutenant, Is it you, Sir? The Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant reply'd, No, Sir. The Terror of the Captain's A≈øpect intimidated the Lieutenant to that Degree, that he look'd like a Gho≈øt. We left him with the Captain, and return'd to Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi>'s Tent, to acquaint him of the Lieutenant's refu≈øing the Command. We had not been long here before Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> ≈øent for us. I was the fir≈øt Per≈øon call'd for; at my entering his Tent, I ≈øaw him ≈øeated on a Che≈øt, with a cock'd Pi≈øtol on his right Thigh; ob≈øerving this, I de≈øir'd
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:007859_0107_102DDB15F7E02F18"/>Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> who was the Mate he always re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly'd on for Navigation, to tell the Captain I did not think proper to come before a cock'd Pi≈øtol: Notwith≈øtanding I was arm'd, I drew back, altho' I had my Pi≈øtol cock'd, and there were ≈øeveral Men near me arm'd with Mu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets. The Captain's per≈øonal Bravery no Man doubted of; his Courage was exce≈ø≈øive, and made him ra≈øh and de≈øperate; his ≈øhoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Mr. <hi>Cozens</hi> was a fatal Proof of it; he was grown more de≈øperate by this unhappy Action, and was ob≈øerv'd ≈øince ≈øeldom to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>have him≈øelf with any Compo≈øure of Mind. It is a Piece of human Prudence to retreat from a Man in a Phrenzy, becau≈øe he who does not value his own Life, has another Man's in his Power. I had no De≈øire of fall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by the Hand of Captain <hi>Cheap,</hi> and ≈øhould be greatly di≈øturb'd to be compell'd, for my own Pre≈øervation, to di≈øcharge a Pi≈øtol at a Gentleman again≈øt whom I never had any Spleen, and who was my Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er. When Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> acquainted him with what I de≈øired him, the Captain threw his Pi≈øtol a≈øide, and came out of his Tent; he told the People, he would go with them to the Southward; he de≈øired to know their Grievances, and he would redre≈øs them: They
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:007859_0108_102DDB183B1ADFE8"/>all call'd out for their Sea-Store of Provi≈øions to be ≈øecur'd, and the re≈øt equally divided. Here the Captain ≈øhow'd all the Conduct and Courage imaginable; he was a ≈øingle Man again≈øt a Multitude, all of 'em di≈ø≈øatisfy'd with him, and all of 'em in Arms: He told 'em the ill Con≈øequence of ≈øharing the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions, that it was living To-day and ≈øtarving To-morrow; but the People were not to be ≈øatisfy'd, the Officers had now no Authority over 'em, and they were ≈øome Time deaf to their Per≈øua≈øions; nay, it was with Difficulty that they could di≈ø≈øuade 'em from pulling down the Store-Tent, and taking away the Provi≈øions by Force; they remov'd the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øions out of the Store-Tent, then fell to digging a Hole to bury the Brandy; the Sea-Store to be ≈øecur'd, the remainder to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ≈øhar'd. Had this been comply'd with, the Con≈øequences might have been very terrible: However, to pacify 'em in ≈øome Shape, it was agreed, that every Man ≈øhould have a Pint of Brandy <hi>per</hi> Day, which, by Calculation, would la≈øt 'em three Weeks. On this they ≈øeem'd very ea≈øy, and went to their re≈øpective Tents. The Captain told his Officers, that he would act nothing contrary to what was agreed on for the Welfare and
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:007859_0109_102DDB19DE90A560"/>Safety of the Community. Finding the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain in a Temper of Mind to hearken to rea≈øon, I ≈øaid to him, Sir, I think it my Duty to inform you, that I am not the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon whom you imagine to be the Principal in this Affair. The Captain an≈øwer'd, How can I think otherwi≈øe? I reply'd, Sir, the Paper I read to you was your Lieutenant's Projec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: There ≈øits the Gentleman, let him di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>own it, if he can. The Captain turning him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to the Lieutenant, ≈øays, Mr. <hi>Bulkeley</hi> has hone≈øtly clear'd him≈øelf. We then drank a Gla≈øs of Wine, and took our Leaves. At Night the Captain ≈øent for Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> and me to ≈øup with him; we were the only Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers pre≈øent with him: When I was ≈øeated, I ≈øaid, Sir, I have my Character at Stake, for drawing back from your cock'd Pi≈øtol: Had I advanc'd, one of us mu≈øt have dropt.</p>
            <p>Captain an≈øwer'd, <hi>Bulkeley,</hi> I do a≈ø≈øure you, the Pi≈øtol was not de≈øign'd for you, but for another; for I knew the Whole before. We then talk'd of indifferent Things, and ≈øpent the Evening in a very affable Manner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> the 29th, came here five <hi>Indian</hi> Canoes, loaden with Mu≈ø≈øels; Men, Women and Children were about fifty: The≈øe <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> had never been with us before; they
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:007859_0110_102DDB1BE3455F88"/>are not ≈øo generous and good natur'd as our Friends I have already mention'd; they were ≈øo mercenary, that they would not part with a ≈øingle Mu≈ø≈øel without ≈øomething in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change; their Stay was but ≈øhort with us, for the next Morning they launch'd their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noes and went off.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tue≈øday, September</hi> the 1≈øt, the Carpenter was ≈øhot in the Thigh with ≈øeveral large Pewter Sluggs by the Captain's Cook; but he being at a great Di≈øtance, the Sluggs did not enter his Skin: Whether this was de≈øign'd, or accidental, we don't know; however, we thought it proper to di≈øarm him.</p>

               <hi>Friday</hi> the 4th, ≈øome Di≈øorders among the People about watching the Provi≈øions, ≈øome taking all Opportunities to rob the Stores. Our Living now is very hard; Shell-fi≈øh are
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:007859_0111_102DDB1E44FFCCE8"/>very ≈øcarce, and difficult to be had; the Sea-weeds are our greate≈øt Support; we have found a Sort of Sea-weed, which we call <hi>Dul≈øe;</hi> it is a narrow Weed, growing on rocks in the Sea, which, when boiled about Two Hours, thickens the Water like Flour; this we e≈øteem a good and whole≈øom Food.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday</hi> the 6th, la≈øt Night the Store-Tent was robbed of Brandy and Flour: The People at hearing of this were greatly enraged, and in≈øi≈øt on ≈øearching the Marines Tents; on Search they found four Bottles of Brandy, and four ≈ømall Parcels of Flour. The Captain ≈øent for the Lieutenant, Ma≈øter, Gunner, Carpenter, and Surgeon, with Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants <hi>Hamilton, Ewers,</hi> and <hi>Fielding,</hi> of the Army; Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi> was al≈øo ≈øent for, but was ≈øo ill that he could not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øent, but de≈øir'd all might pa≈øs according to the Judgment of the above-mentioned Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. A Con≈øultation was held: Five of the accus'd Marines did not appear, dreading the Puni≈øhment due to their Crime; they march'd off to the De≈øerters: Four more, who ≈øtaid to be try'd, receiv'd Sentence, on the fir≈øt Opportunity, to carry them off to the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <hi>Friday</hi> the 18th, <hi>Dennis O'Lary</hi> and <hi>John Redwood,</hi> Seamen, with ≈øix Marines, were put off to the Main, according to their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence; it being a fine Summer's Day. This Day the Lieutenant, bringing a Pair of Pi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tols to the Carpenter, and complaining they were in bad Order, did not imagine they were loaded, ≈ønapping the fir≈øt it mi≈øs'd Fire, the ≈øecond went off, but providentially did no Harm, tho' the Lieutenant had then a Crowd of People about him.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday</hi> the 20th, little Wind, and clear Weather. Launch'd the Barge, and went off to the Wreck; we took up four Ca≈øks of Beef, with a Ca≈øk of Pea≈øe, which was ≈øtav'd; we ≈øerv'd out to each Man five Pieces of Beef, and Pea≈øe to ≈øuch as would have 'em, but there were none to take 'em, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving now Plenty of Meat, our Stomachs are become nice and dainty.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedne≈øday</hi> the 23d, the People went to the Captain with a Two Gallon Cagg, and a≈øk'd it full of Wine: The Captain refus'd 'em; but apprehending that they would make no Ceremony of filling it without Leave, and carrying it off by Force, he thought proper to order it to be fill'd: They brought it to the Long-Boat, and drank it in her Hold.
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:007859_0116_102DDB28DCBBA2F8"/>Stept the Long-Boat's Ma≈øt forward. The People very much di≈øorder'd in Liquor, and very quarrel≈øome.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thur≈øday</hi> the 24th, I was ≈øent on a Week's Cruize in the Barge; the Officers with me were Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> the Mate, and the Hon. Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> Mid≈øhipman, and Mr. <hi>Harvey</hi> the Pur≈øer, who was a good Draught≈øman; we went in order to di≈øcover the Coa≈øt to the Southward, for the Safety of the Long-Boat; we were inform'd on our return, that the People in our Ab≈øence went to the Captain, and got two Gallons of Wine which they mixed with their half Pints of Brandy; they got all drunk and mad, but no great Mi≈øchiefs en≈øued. Six <hi>Indian</hi> Canoes likewi≈øe came in our Ab≈øence loaded with Men, Women and Children; they brought with them Clams out of the Shells ≈øtrung on Lines: The <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> Women dived for Mu≈ø≈øels, and brought them a≈øhore in abundance; the Men went to the fre≈øh Water river, and caught ≈øeveral Fi≈øh like our <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Mullets. The People bought Dogs of the <hi>Indians,</hi> which they kill'd, and eat, e≈øteeming the Fle≈øh very good Food: The next Day the <hi>Indians</hi> went out and caught a va≈øt Quantity of Fi≈øh out of a Pond, where they ≈øent in their Dogs to hunt;
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:007859_0117_102DDB2AB478A9B8"/>the Dogs dived, and drove the Fi≈øh a≈øhore in great Numbers, to one Part of the Pond, as if they had been drawn in a Seyne: the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> ≈øold the Fi≈øh to the People. This Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod of catching Fi≈øh is, I believe, unknown any where el≈øe, and was very ≈øurpri≈øing; and, what is al≈øo very ≈øtrange, after the <hi>Indians</hi> went away, we hauled the Seyne over the Pond, and could never get a Fi≈øh.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> the 28th, returned with the Barge; the fir≈øt Evening we were out we had a good Harbour for the Barge, which we put into; the fir≈øt Animal we ≈øaw was a fine large Bitch, big with Puppies; we killed her; we then roa≈øted one Side, and boiled the other, were exceeding well plea≈øed with our Fare, ≈øupped heartily, and ≈ølept well: The next Morning we got up at Day-breaking, and proceeded on our Cruize, finding all along the Coa≈øt to be very dangerous; at Evening put into a Place of very good Shelter for the Barge: Here we found the <hi>Indians</hi> had been very lately, the Shore being covered with the Offals of Seal: In an Hour's Time we killed ten wild Fowl; we roa≈øted three Gee≈øe and two Ducks, the re≈øt we put into a Sea Pye, ≈øo that we fared mo≈øt elegantly; got up at Day-light next Morning, but ≈øeeing the
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:007859_0118_102DDB2C5409BED8"/>Weather hazy and dirty, thought it not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to put out with the Barge, fearing we ≈øhould not get a Harbour before Night; we took a Walk five Miles in the Country cro≈øs the Land to the Southward, but could not ≈øee any Shelter for the Boat, being then twelve Leagues from the Place we came from; ≈øo we returned back in the Evening, and got into a fine ≈øandy Bay; I think it as good a Harbour for Shipping as any I ever ≈øaw: Coming into this Bay, ≈øaw the Southmo≈øt Land, which we had ≈øeen before, bearing about S. S. W. right over an Inlet of Land, about two Miles. After landing, lived as we did la≈øt Night; in the Morning we walked over, where we found a deep Bay, it being eighteen Leagues deep, and twelve Leagues broad; here we had a very good Pro≈øpect of the Coa≈øt; we found here the green Pea≈øe that Sir <hi>John Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough</hi> mentions in his Book.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> the 3d of <hi>October,</hi> after our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from the Cruize, the Lieutenant, the Ma≈øter, my≈øelf, the Boat≈øwain, and Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> the Mate, went to the Captain, to acquaint him how forward the Boat was, and to con≈øult ≈øome Mea≈øures to be ob≈øerv'd on board the Boat, to prevent Mutiny; he de≈øir'd a Day or two to con≈øider of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="87" facs="unknown:007859_0119_102DDB3001620CB8"/>
On <hi>Monday</hi> the 5th, the Carpenter ≈øent his Ca≈øe Bottle, as u≈øual, to the Captain, to be filled with Wine; but it was ≈øent back empty, with this An≈øwer, I will give him none: This ≈øudden Change of the Captain's Behaviour to the Carpenter, proceeded from ≈øome Words which the latter dropt, and were carried to the Captain; The Words the Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter ≈øpoke were to this Purport, That he was not to be led by Favour or Affection, nor to be bia≈ø≈øed by a Bottle of Brandy. To-day we heeled the Long-Boat, and caulked the Starboard Side, paid ber Bottom with Wax, Tallow, and Soap, that came out of the Ship.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tue≈øday</hi> the 6th, hard Gales at N. W. and N. with rain: This Morning the Lieutenant acquainted us of the Captain's re≈øolution, which was to be Captain as before, and to be governed by the rules of the Navy, and to ≈øtand or fall by them; it was objected in the pre≈øent Situation, the rules of the Navy are not ≈øufficient to direct us, ≈øeveral rules be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing requi≈øite in our Circum≈øtances which are not mention'd there; that the whole Body of Officers and People are determin'd not to be govern'd by tho≈øe rules at pre≈øent. This Objection was ≈øtarted, not from a Di≈øre≈øpect
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:007859_0120_102DDB31F0293558"/>to tho≈øe rules; but we imagin'd, if Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> was re≈øtor'd to the ab≈øolute Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand he had before the Lo≈øs of the <hi>Wager,</hi> that he would proceed again upon the ≈øame Principles, never on any Exigence con≈øult his Officers, but act arbitrarily, according to his Humour and Confidence of ≈øuperior Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: While he acts with rea≈øon, we will ≈øupport his Command with our Lives; but ≈øome re≈øtriction is nece≈ø≈øary for our own Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation. We think him a Gentleman worthy to have a limitted Command, but too dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous a Per≈øon to be tru≈øted with an ab≈øolute one. This Afternoon the People in≈øi≈øted to be ≈øerv'd Brandy out of the Ca≈øks that were buried Under-ground; accordingly they were ≈øerv'd half a Pint each Man. Got the Long-Boat upright.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thur≈øday</hi> the 8th, this Day the Ma≈øter went to the Captain concerning ten half Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels of Powder more than can be carried off, which will make good Water-Ca≈øks for the Boats: The Captain told him not to ≈øtart the Powder, or de≈øtroy any Thing without his Orders; and ≈øaid, he mu≈øt have Time to con≈øider of it. In the Afternoon, Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi> of the Land Forces, came on the Beach, and de≈øired the A≈ø≈øi≈øtance of the
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:007859_0121_102DDB33983B4EE0"/>Seamen to take Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> a Pri≈øoner, for the Death of Mr. <hi>Cozens,</hi> the Mid≈øhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; telling us, he ≈øhould be call'd to an Account, if he did not. This Evening the Carpenter went up to the Hill-Tent, ≈øo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from its Situation; the People were ≈øhooting Balls at Marks; ≈øome of 'em were firing in Vollies, without Shot or Sluggs: One of the Men on the Beach fir'd at the Tent while the Carpenter was in it, who was ≈øtanding with a Book in his Hand; there was a Piece of Beef hung clo≈øe at his Cheek, the Ball went through the Tent and the Beef, but the Carpenter receiv'd no Damage. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day I overhaul'd the Powder, and told the Lieutenant that I had twenty-three half Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels in Store, and that we could not carry off in the Ve≈ø≈øel above ≈øix half Barrels; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore purpo≈øe to ≈øtart the Overplus into the Sea, and make Water-Ca≈øks of the half Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rels, they being very proper for that Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe. I de≈øired him to acquaint the Captain with my Intention; that ≈øince he had no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard for the Publick Good, or to any Thing that tending to promoting it, the Carpenter and I had determin'd never to go near him again. The Lieutenant declin'd going, fear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Captain would murder him; but he
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:007859_0122_102DDB35A4F2C938"/>≈øent the Ma≈øter to him, to let him know the Nece≈ø≈øity of ≈øtarting the Powder: The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's An≈øwer to the Ma≈øter was, I de≈øire you will not de≈øtroy any one Thing without my Orders. We now are convinc'd the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain hath no Intention of going to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, notwith≈øtanding he had lately given his Word and Honour that he would; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Captain <hi>Pemberton,</hi> in order to put an End to all future Ob≈øtructions, demanded our A≈ø≈øi≈øtance to make him a Pri≈øoner for the ≈øhooting Mr. <hi>Cozens,</hi> intending to carry him as ≈øuch to <hi>England;</hi> at the ≈øame Time to confine Lieutenant <hi>Hamilton</hi> with him: which was readily agreed to by the whole Body. It was reckon'd dangerous to ≈øuffer the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain any longer to enjoy Liberty; therefore the Lieutenant, Gunner, Carpenter, and Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> the Mate, re≈øolv'd next Morning to ≈øurprize him in his Bed.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> the 9th, this Morning went in a Body and ≈øurpriz'd the Captain in Bed, di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd him, and took every Thing out of his Tent. The Captain ≈øaid to the Seamen, what are you about? Where are my Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers? At which the Ma≈øter, Gunner, Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, and Boat≈øwain, went in. The Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ≈øaid, Gentlemen, do you know what
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:007859_0123_102DDB37E4CFFB10"/>you have done, or are about? He was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer'd, Yes, Sir, our A≈ø≈øi≈øtance was demanded by Captain <hi>Pemberton,</hi> to ≈øecure you as a Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoner for the Death of Mr. <hi>Cozens;</hi> and as we are Subjects of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> we are oblig'd to take you as ≈øuch to <hi>England.</hi> The Captain ≈øaid, Gentlemen, Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi> hath nothing to do with me; I am your Commander ≈øtill; I will ≈øhew you my In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtructions; which he did to the People; on this we came out. He then call'd his Officers a ≈øecond Time, and ≈øaid, What is this for? He was an≈øwer'd, as before, That A≈ø≈øi≈øtance was demanded by Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi> to take him Pri≈øoner for the Death of Mr. <hi>Cozens.</hi> He ≈øtill in≈øi≈øted, Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi> has no Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øine≈øs with me; I could not think you would ≈øerve me ≈øo. It was told him, Sir, it is your own Fault: you have given your≈øelf no man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Concern, for the Publick Good, on our going from hence; but have acted quite the rever≈øe, or el≈øe been ≈øo carele≈øs and indifferent about it, as if we had no Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander; and if other Per≈øons had given them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves no more Trouble and Concern than you have, we ≈øhould not be ready to go from hence as long as Provi≈øions la≈øted. The Captain ≈øaid, Very well, Gentlemen, you have
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:007859_0124_102DDB3A275D4158"/>caught me Napping; I do not ≈øee any of you in Liquor; you are a Parcel of brave Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, but my Officers are Scoundrels: Then turning him≈øelf to me, he ≈øaid, Gunner, where's my Lieutenant? Did not he Head You? I told him, No, Sir; but was here to ≈øee it executed, and is here now. One of you (≈øays the Captain) call Mr. <hi>Beans.</hi> When Mr. <hi>Beans</hi> came, he ≈øaid, What is all this for, Sir? Sir, it is Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi>'s Order. Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi> hath no Bu≈øine≈øs with me, and you will an≈øwer for it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after; if I do not live to ≈øee <hi>England,</hi> I hope ≈øome of my Friends will. On this the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant left him. The Captain then addre≈øs'd him≈øelf to the Seamen, ≈øaying, My Lads, I do not blame you; but it is the Villany of my Officers, which they will an≈øwer for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. He then call'd Mr. <hi>Beans</hi> again, and ≈øaid, Well, Sir, what do you de≈øign to do by me? The Lieutenant an≈øwer'd, Sir, your Officers have de≈øign'd the Pur≈øer's Tent for you. Hum! I ≈øhould be obliged to the Gentlemen, if they would let me ≈øtay in my own Tent. The Lieutenant came to acquaint the Officers of the Captain's reque≈øt; but they judg'd it inconvenient; as Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi>'s Tent join'd the Pur≈øer's, one Guard might ≈øerve
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:007859_0125_102DDB3BC45413F8"/>'em both; accordingly all his Things were mov'd to the Pur≈øer's Tent: As he was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing along, he ≈øaid, Gentlemen, you mu≈øt excu≈øe my not pulling my Hat off, my Hands are confin'd. Well, Captain <hi>Beans!</hi> you will be call'd to an Account for this here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. The Boat≈øwain, after the Captain's Confinement, mo≈øt barbarou≈øly in≈øulted him, reproaching him with ≈øtriking him, ≈øaying, Then it was your Time; but now, G‚Äîd d‚Äîn you, it is mine. The Captain made no reply but this, You are a Scoundrel for u≈øing a Gentleman ill when he is a Pri≈øoner. When the Captain was a Pri≈øoner, he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, he never intended to go to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, having more Honour than to turn his Back on his Enemies; and farther, he ≈øaid, Gentlemen, I do not want to go off in any of your Craft; for I never de≈øign'd to go for <hi>England,</hi> and would rather chu≈øe to be ≈øhot by you; there is not a ≈øingle Man on the Beach dare engage me; but this is what I fear'd.</p>
            <p>It is very odd, that Capt. <hi>Cheap</hi> ≈øhould now declare he never intended to go to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, when he publickly gave his Word and Honour he would go that Way, or any Way where the Spirit of the People led: But he
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:007859_0126_102DDB3E08F17978"/>afterwards told his Officers, he knew he had a ≈øevere Trial to go through, if ever he came to <hi>England;</hi> and as for tho≈øe who liv'd to return to their Country, the only Favour he reque≈øted from them, was to declare the Truth, without Favour or Prejudice; and this we promis'd faithfully to do: His Words, in this re≈øpect, were as much regarded by us as the Words of a dying Man, and have been mo≈øt punctually ob≈øerv'd.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Saturday</hi> the 10th, little Wind at N. and N. W. Getting all ready for going off this Afternoon, the Captain ≈øent for the Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant and me, de≈øiring us both to go to Captain <hi>Pemberton,</hi> to know what he intended to do with him. We accordingly came, and both promis'd to go directly, and bring him his An≈øwer. When we came out, went to the Lieutenant's Tent; from thence I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, and made no doubt, but he would go to Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi>'s: But when I a≈øk'd him; he refus'd; which very much ≈øurpriz'd me. I thought it very ungenerous to triflle with Captain <hi>Cheap,</hi> or any Gentleman in his unhappy Situation; therefore went alone to Captain <hi>Pemberton.</hi> When I deliver'd him Captain <hi>Cheap</hi>'s Me≈ø≈øage, the An≈øwer was, I de≈øign, and mu≈øt carry him Pri≈øoner to
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:007859_0127_102DDB4053BCC7B8"/>
               <hi>England.</hi> I return'd, and acquainted Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> with Captain <hi>Pemberton</hi>'s An≈øwer: He ask'd me then, if the Lieutenant was with me. I told him, No; and I believe did not de≈øign it. He ≈øaid, Mr. <hi>Bulkeley,</hi> I am very much oblig'd to you, and could not think the Lieutenant would u≈øe me thus. In the Evening the Lieutenant and I were ≈øent for again: The Captain ≈øaid to the Lieutenant, Sir, have you been with Captain <hi>Pemberton?</hi> He an≈øwer'd, No, Sir. I thought, Sir, you promis'd me you would: However, I have his An≈øwer from Mr. <hi>Bulkeley;</hi> I am to be carry'd a Pri≈øoner to <hi>England.</hi> Gentlemen, I ≈øhall never live to ≈øee <hi>England,</hi> but die by Inches in the Voyage; and it is ≈øurprizing to me to think, what you can expect by going to the Southward, where there are ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øand Difficulties to be encounter'd with: I am ≈øorry ≈øo many brave Fellows ≈øhould be led to go where they are not acquainted, when, by going to the Northward, there is the I≈øland of <hi>Chili,</hi> not above ninety Leagues, where we need not fear taking Prizes, and may have a Chance to ≈øee the Commodore. I made An≈øwer, Sir, you have ≈øaid, that we ≈øhall be call'd to an Account for this in <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land:</hi> I mu≈øt tell you, for my Part, had I
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:007859_0128_102DDB4244146348"/>been guilty of any Crime, and was ≈øure of being hang'd for it in <hi>England,</hi> I would make it my Choice to go there, ≈øooner than to the Northward: Have not you given your Word and Honour to go to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward? It is true, there is a Chance in going to the Northward, by delivering us from this unhappy Situation of Life to a wor≈øe, <hi>viz.</hi> a <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Pri≈øon. The Captain ≈øaid no more but this, Gentlemen, I wi≈øh you well, and ≈øafe to <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday</hi> the 11th, this Morning the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ≈øent for me, and told me, he had rather be ≈øhot than carried off a Pri≈øoner, and that he would not go off with us; therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øired me to ask the People to ≈øuffer him to remain on the I≈øland: The People readily agreed to his reque≈øt; and al≈øo con≈øented to leave him all Things needful for his Support, as much as could be ≈øpar'd. Lieutenant <hi>Hamilton</hi> and the Surgeon cho≈øe to ≈øtay with him. We offer'd him al≈øo the Barge and Yawl, if he could procure Men to go with him. The Que≈øtion was propos'd before the whole Body; but they all cry'd aloud for <hi>England,</hi> and let him ≈øtay and be d‚Äîn'd; does he want to carry us to Pri≈øon? There is not a Man will go. The Captain being
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:007859_0129_102DDB43DE9B24E0"/>depriv'd of his Command in the Manner above-mentioned, and for the rea≈øons already given, it was re≈øolv'd to draw ≈øome Articles to be ≈øign'd for the Good of the Community, and to give the Lieutenant a limited Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. The Paper was drawn up in this Manner:</p>
            <p>WHereas Captain <hi>David Cheap,</hi> our Commander in his Maje≈øty's Ship the <hi>Wager,</hi> never con≈øulted any of his Officers for the Safety and Pre≈øervation of the ≈øaid Ship, and his Maje≈øty's Subjects thereto be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing; but ≈øeveral Times, ≈øince the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Lo≈øs of the ≈øaid Ship, he has been ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licited in the mo≈øt dutiful Manner, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing him at the ≈øame Time to ≈øupport his Command with our Lives, de≈øiring no more than to go off Heart in Hand from this Place to the Southward, which he gave his Word and Honour to do; and being almo≈øt ready for ≈øailing, did apply to him, ≈øome few Days pa≈øt, to draw up ≈øome proper Articles, in order to ≈øuppre≈øs Mutiny, and other material Things, which were thought nece≈ø≈øary to be agreed to before we went off; but he, in the mo≈øt ≈øcornful Manner, hath rejected every Thing propos'd for the Publick Good; and
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:007859_0130_102DDB45CF72AE70"/>as he is now a Pri≈øoner, and the Command given to the Lieutenant, upon his Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the following Articles.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fir≈øt,</hi> As we have no Conveniency for dre≈ø≈øing Provi≈øions on Board the Ve≈ø≈øel for a third Part of the Number to be carried off the Spot, therefore this Day ≈øerv'd ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> to every Man and Boy twelve Days Provi≈øion, for them to dre≈øs before we go off; and al≈øo it is agreed, that whoever is guilty of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frauding another of any Part of his Allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, on ≈øufficient Proof thereof, the Per≈øon found guilty (without any re≈øpect of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon) ≈øhall be put on Shore at the fir≈øt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Place, and left there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> In regard to the Boats going off with us, we think proper to allow one Week's Provi≈øion for each Man appointed to go in them, in order to prevent Separation from each other, which would be of the wor≈øt Con≈øequence of any Thing that can happen to us; to prevent which we do agree, that when under-way they ≈øhall not ≈øeparate, but always keep within Musket-≈øhot, and on no Pretence or Excu≈øe what≈øoever go beyond that reach. The Officer, or any other Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon, that ≈øhall attempt a Separation, or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:007859_0131_102DDB48333A51A0"/>the above mention'd Bounds, ≈øhall, on Proof, be put on ≈øhore and left behind.</p>
            <p>

               <hi>Thur≈øday</hi> the 15th, This Morning, it being Calm, made a Signal for the Boats to come off, by firing five Mu≈økets. At Day-light came to Sail, with the Wind at W. by N. It blowing hard, and a great Swell, the Ve≈ø≈øel would not work; therefore we were oblig'd to put into a ≈ømall Bay, lying S. W. of <hi>Harvey</hi>'s Bay, where we had a very good Shelter, there being a large Ledge of rocks without us, which broke the Sea off. At Eleven we ≈øent the Barge to <hi>Cheap</hi>'s Bay for what Canva≈øs could be found ≈øerviceable, having left a ≈øufficient Quantity behind, to ≈øupply us with Sails, in Ca≈øe we wanted 'em. Went in the Barge the Hon. <hi>John Byron,</hi> at his own reque≈øt, <hi>Alexander Campbell</hi> Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhipman, <hi>William Harvey</hi> Quarter-Gunner, <hi>David Buckley</hi> ditto, <hi>William Ro≈øe</hi> Quarter-Ma≈øter, <hi>Richard Noble</hi> ditto, <hi>Peter Pla≈øtow</hi> Captain's Steward, <hi>Jo≈øeph Clinch</hi> Seaman, and <hi>Rowland Cru≈ø≈øet</hi> Marine. This Afternoon the Carpenter want a≈øhore in the Cutter, with
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:007859_0141_102DDB5BF08EB1D0"/>≈øeveral of the People, to look for Proven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Shot ≈øeveral Gee≈øe, and other Sea-Fowl; rainy Weather. Wind W. N. W.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> the 16th, continual rain, and hard Gales all Night at S. W. This Morning the Carpenter came on Board, and acquainted us that he ≈øaw an Anchor of ≈øeven Feet in the Shank, the Palm of each Arm filed off ju≈øt above the Crown: This Anchor we ≈øuppo≈øe to have belong'd to ≈øome ≈ømall Ve≈ø≈øel wreck'd on the Coa≈øt. The Cutter brought off Abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of Shell-fi≈øh ready dre≈øs'd for the People.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sunday</hi> the 18th, at Noon, the Cutter came off, and brought aboard Plenty of Shell-fi≈øh and Greens. The Honourable Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> and three of the Barge's Crew, came from where the Barge lay. Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> came aboard, and inform'd us of the Barge's being ≈øafe in the Bay, where we left her, and only waited the Opportunity of Weather to come round with her: At the ≈øame Time he de≈øired to know, if we would give him, and tho≈øe who would ≈øtay with Captain <hi>Cheap,</hi> their Share of Provi≈øions. This Que≈øtion of Mr. <hi>Byron</hi>'s very much ≈øurpriz'd us; and what ≈øurpriz'd us more was, that he ≈øhould be influenc'd by Mr. <hi>Campbell,</hi> a Per≈øon whom he always held in Contempt. As for my
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:007859_0142_102DDB5EA5EBC768"/>Part, believe Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> left us becau≈øe he could not get any Accomodation aboard the Ve≈ø≈øel that he lik'd, being oblig'd to lie forward with the Men; as were al≈øo the Carpenter and my≈øelf, when below: It is very certain, that we are ≈øo clo≈øely pent up for want of room, that the wor≈øt Jail in <hi>England</hi> is a Palace to our pre≈øent Situation.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tue≈øday</hi> the 20th, ≈øerv'd out to the People eight Days Flour, to be dre≈øs'd a≈øhore. I went in the Cutter to Command in my Turn for a Week.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedne≈øday</hi> the 21≈øt, clo≈øe Weather; the Wind from W. to N. W. with rain and Hail. Brought aboard Shell-fi≈øh in abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance. At Noon the Honourable Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> came with ≈øome of the Crew Over-land; he a≈øk'd me, whether the Boat's Crew were gone off, and if we had ≈øerv'd the Provi≈øion, for he wanted to return to the Barge. I told him all the People were out a Fi≈øhing, and that the fir≈øt who came in ≈øhould carry him off. On which he ≈øaid, I think we will go and get ≈øome Fi≈øh too, having nothing el≈øe to live on. This was the la≈øt Time I ever ≈øaw his Honour. When the People return'd from fi≈øhing, they told me Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> had lo≈øt his Hat, the Wind blowing it off his Head,
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:007859_0143_102DDB60E8E29D20"/>I ≈øaid, rather than he ≈øhould want a Hat, I would give him my own. One of the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men forced a Hat on his Head; his Name was <hi>John Duck:</hi> But Mr. <hi>Byron</hi> would by no Means wear it; ≈øaying, <hi>John!</hi> I thank you; if I accept of your Kindne≈øs, you mu≈øt go bare-headed; and, I think, I can bear Hard≈øhips as well as the be≈øt of you, and mu≈øt u≈øe my≈øelf to them. I took eight Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and went over Land to the Place where the Barge lay, to get the Canva≈øs that we ≈øtood ≈øo much in Need of; but found ≈øhe was gone from thence. The People in the Barge told our Men, that they would return to us again; but it is plain they never intended it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thur≈øday</hi> the 22d, This Day we ≈øaw Sea-Fowl in va≈øt Flocks flying to the Southward, where was a dead Whale. Look'd out all this Day for the Barge, but to no Purpo≈øe. The Barge not returning was a very great Misfortune, having no Boat but the Cutter; and if by an unlucky Accident we lo≈øe her, we mu≈øt be reduced to the greate≈øt Extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to get Provi≈øion. The Per≈øons in the Barge, except the Captain's Steward, always approv'd of going to the Southward; but it ≈øeems Mr. <hi>Campbell</hi> the Patroon prevail'd on 'em to return to Captain <hi>Cheap.</hi>
            </p>

               <hi>Friday</hi> the 23d, Saw Thou≈øands of Sea-Fowl; in the Morning they fly to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and in the Evening come back to the South; they are Birds of a very large Size, but of what Kind we do not know. Since we have been here we ≈øaw ≈øeveral <hi>Indian</hi> Graves; they are dug ju≈øt within the Surface of the Earth, with a Board on each Side, and a Cro≈øs ≈øtuck up at the Head. The Day following a Gun, a four Pounder, was ≈øeen near the Anchor in <hi>Clam</hi> Bay; we call it by this Name, becau≈øe of the va≈øt Quantities of this Sort of Shell-fi≈øh which are found there.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday</hi> the 26th, it being very calm, and fair Weather, I went a≈øhore to bring off the People; weigh'd the Long-Boat, and took her in Tow over a Bar, where was ten Feet Water, but a great Swell; as ≈øoon we got over the Bar, there ≈øprung up a Breeze of Wind at N. W. ≈øteer'd away S. half E. for the Southmo≈øt Part of Land, which bore S. by E. di≈øtant fourteen Leagues. The two Points of Land make a large and deep ≈øandy Bay; we ≈øounded, but found no Ground; it is a bold Shore clo≈øe to. I kept a-head in the Cutter, in order to provide a Harbour for the Long-Boat; Providence directed us to a very good one: It blew ≈øo hard, with thick
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:007859_0145_102DDB6460DD48C8"/>hazy Weather, that we could not keep the Sea. At Eight at Night we anchor'd in eight Fathom Water a-brea≈øt of a fine ≈øandy Bay, and Land lock'd not above three Boats Length from the Shores: At the Entrance of the Harbour, which lies about a League up the <hi>Lagoon,</hi> I ≈øet the Land; the Northmo≈øt Point bore by the Compa≈øs N. by E. di≈øtant twelve Leagues, and the Southmo≈øt S. by W. di≈øtant five Leagues, the Entrance lies E.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tue≈øday</hi> the 27th, Fre≈øh Gales at W. and cloudy Weather, with a great Swell without, in≈øomuch that we could not put out to Sea; we therefore ≈øent the People a≈øhore to dre≈øs their Provi≈øions: each Man is allow'd but a Quarter of a Pound of Flour <hi>per</hi> Day, without any other Sub≈øi≈øtence, but what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence brings in our Way.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thur≈øday</hi> the 29th, Early this Morning, it being calm and thick Weather, with ≈ømall rain, we rowed out of the <hi>Lagoon;</hi> at Five it cleared up, with a fre≈øh Breeze at S. S. E. ≈øteer'd S. W. and S. W. by W. ≈øaw a ≈ømall I≈øland bearing S. by W. the Southmo≈øt End S. by E. This I≈øland we call the rock of <hi>Dundee,</hi> it being much like that I≈øland in the <hi>We≈øt-Indies;</hi> but not ≈øo large, it lieth about four Leagues di≈øtant from the Southmo≈øt
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:007859_0146_102DDB675604DF10"/>Point of Land out at Sea. This Day it blow'd ≈øo hard, that we were oblig'd to take the Cutter in Tow.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> the 30th, Hard Gales, and a great Sea; ≈øaw ≈øome I≈ølands and ≈øome ≈øunken rocks; at Six ≈øaw the Main in two Points of Land, with a large Opening; on each Side <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he ≈øunken rocks are innumerable; the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance is ≈øo dangerous, that no Mortal would attempt it, unle≈øs his Ca≈øe was de≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, as ours; we having nothing but Death before our Eyes in keeping the Sea, and the ≈øame Pro≈øpect in running in with the Land: We ran in before the Wind to the Opening that appear'd between the two Points, the Northmo≈øt of which bore N. by E. and the Southmo≈øt S. by E. We ≈øteer'd in E. and found the Opening to be a large <hi>Lagoon,</hi> on the Southmo≈øt Side, running into a very good Harbour; here our ≈ømall Ve≈ø≈øel lay ≈øecure in a Cove, which Nature had form'd like a Dock; we had no Occa≈øion to let go an An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor, but ran along-≈øide the Land, and made fa≈øt our Head and Stern. The People went a≈øhore in Search of Provi≈øion; here we found Plenty of Wood and Water, and fine large Mu≈ø≈øels in great Quantities. Serv'd to each Man half a Piece of Beef.</p>

               <hi>Saturday</hi> the 31≈øt, This Morning ca≈øt loo≈øe, and row'd towards the Mouth of the <hi>Lagoons,</hi> de≈øigning to put out to Sea; but the Wind blew ≈øo hard, that we were oblig'd to come to an Anchor. This Afternoon, in weighing the Grapenel, in order to go to the Cove, we found it foul among ≈øome rocks; all Hands haul'd, took a turn round the Main-ma≈ø<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap> and went aft; which weigh'd the Grapenel, but ≈øtreighten'd one of the Flukes: Here the Land is very high and ≈øteep on each Side; the Carpenter and Cooper were on the highe≈øt of the≈øe Hills, and found deep Ponds of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the Top of them; the≈øe Hills are very rocky, and there are great Falls of Water all along the Coa≈øt: The whole Navy of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland</hi> may lay with Safety in many of tho≈øe <hi>Lagoons;</hi> but the Coa≈øt is too dangerous for any Ship to fall in with the Land. The Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple To-day were very much afflicted with the Gripes, and Pains in their Side. Here are Abundance of Trees, not unlike our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ew Trees: they are not above ≈øeven or eight Inches in Diameter, and the Bark is like Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar. The Land is to Appearance very good; but on digging beneath the Surface, we find it almo≈øt an entire Stone. We ≈øaw no People here, tho', it is plain, here have been ≈øome
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:007859_0148_102DDB6A8E085C88"/>lately, by their Wigg-wams or Huts. We are ≈øo clo≈øely pent up for want of room, that our Lodging is very uncomfortable; the Stench of the Mens wet Cloaths makes the Air we breathe nau≈øeous to that Degree, that one would think it impo≈ø≈øible for a Man to live below. We came to ≈øail, and ≈øteer'd out of the <hi>Lagoon</hi> We≈øt; went into a ≈øandy Bay, one League to the Southward of the <hi>Lagoon, Indian</hi> Huts to be ≈øeen, but no Natives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Monday, November</hi> the 2d, at Five in the Morning, came to ≈øail with the Wind at S. and S. by E. At Noon the Wind came to the W. and W.N.W. in ≈ømall Breezes: This Day I had a very good Ob≈øervation, it being the fir≈øt ≈øince we left <hi>Cheap</hi>'s I≈øland. We found our≈øelves in the Latitude of 50:00 S. After ob≈øerving, bore away, and ran into a fine ≈ømooth Pa≈ø≈øage between the I≈øland and the Main. The≈øe I≈ølands I believe to be the ≈øame that are taken Notice of in <hi>Cook</hi>'s Voy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age. From the Entrance to the Northward, to the going out of the Cape of <hi>Good Hope</hi> (as we call it) the Di≈øtance is about ≈øix Leagues, and the Depth of Water is from two Fathom to twelve; the Northmo≈øt Land before we came into the Pa≈ø≈øage bore N. by W.
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:007859_0149_102DDB6D49ECFC30"/>and the Southmo≈øt, or Cape of <hi>Good Hope</hi> bore S. by E. In the Evening anchored in a fine ≈øandy Bay: Here we al≈øo ≈øaw <hi>Indian</hi> Huts, but no People; To-day we ≈øhot wild Gee≈øe in Abundance, and got of Shell-Fi≈øh, as Limpets and Mu≈ø≈øels.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Tue≈øday</hi> the 3d, At Four this Morning weighed, and came to ≈øail with the Wind at W. till we got about the Cape of <hi>Good Hope,</hi> then at W. N. W. ≈øteering S. and a tumbling Sea from the W. The Cutter ≈øteer'd S. by E. into a deep Bay; ≈øuppo≈øing them not to ≈øee the Southmo≈øt Land, we made the Signal for her, by hoi≈øting an En≈øign at the Topping-Lift; as the Cutter was coming up to us, her ≈øquare Sail ≈øplitted; we offered to take them in Tow, but they would not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept it; we lay with our Sails down ≈øome time before they would ≈øhow any Signal of making Sail; coming before the Wind, and a large Sea, we ordered them to ≈øteer away for the Southmo≈øt Point of Land after us, and to keep as near as po≈ø≈øible: but in≈øtead of ob≈øerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our Directions, they ≈øteered away into the Cod of a deep Bay, ≈øuppo≈øed to be <hi>King</hi>'s Bay: The Cutter being much to Lee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and the Weather coming on very thick, we were obliged to ≈øteer after her, but ≈øoon
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:007859_0150_102DDB6EE80E2298"/>lo≈øt Sight of her. The Place being exceeding dangerous, we could not venture any farther after the Cutter; therefore we hauled by the Wind to the Southward; it continued blowing hard, with thick Weather, with ≈øunken rocks, and Breakers, ≈øo that we were obliged to bear away before the Wind into a large Bay, the Tide running rampant, and in a great Swell, every where ≈øurrounded with ≈øunken rocks, that we thought nothing but a Miracle could ≈øave us; at la≈øt we got ≈øafe into the Bay, and came to in two Fathom Water, we ≈øteered in E. At four this Morning rowed out between the I≈ølands; after we got out, had a fre≈øh Breeze at N. W. ≈øteered out <hi>S. S. W.</hi> then <hi>S.</hi> and <hi>S.</hi> by <hi>E.</hi> the Cutter a-head.

When they found we would not go into that Bay, they hoi≈øted their Main≈øail, and went a-head; being ≈øome Di≈øtance a-head, we made ≈øail, the Cutter ≈øtill keeping a-head till One o'Clock, then ≈øhe bore away

At half an Hour pa≈øt Two, the Cutter being on the Beam, and four Miles within us, we bore away after them; and in a very heavy Squall of Wind and rain we lo≈øt ≈øight of her: After the Squall was over, it cleared up, but we ≈øaw nothing of the Cutter, nor could we clear the Shore to the Northward, being not above two Miles off the Breakers; therefore we were under a Nece≈ø≈øity of hauling to the ≈øouthward for Self-pre≈øervation, and very narrowly e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcaped clearing the rocks: After running about three Lragues, ≈øaw an Opening, where we hoped to find a good Harbour; bore away for the Opening, we were here again ≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with rocks and Breakers, with a hard Gale of Wind, and a great Sea, the olde≈øt Seaman on board never ≈øaw a more di≈ømal Pro≈øpect; we ran in before the Wind for about two Leagues, expecting every ri≈øe and Fall of the Sea to be a Wreck, but Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence at length conducted us to an indiffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Place of Shelter: We are now in a mo≈øt wretched Condition, having no Boat to go

<pb n="127" facs="unknown:007859_0159_102DDB81C54ECB90"/>got about four Leagues right out, every Way ≈øurrounded with rocks and Breakers, with a great We≈øtern Swell: We found it a very difficult Matter to get clear of tho≈øe rocks and Breakers, they reach along ≈øhore eighteen Leagues, and without us at Sea eight Leagues, I take it, that from the Land they are fourteen Leagues in the Offing; tho≈øe ≈øunken rocks appear like a low level Land. This Coa≈øt is too dangerous for Shipping, the Wind being three Parts of the Year to the We≈øtward, which blows right on the Shore, with a large We≈øtern ≈øwell, that ≈øeldom or never cea≈øes; it always blows and rains; it is wor≈øe here than in the rainy ≈øea≈øon on the Coa≈øt of <hi>Guinea;</hi> nor can we as yet di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh Summer from Winter, only by the Length of the Days.

I never in my Life, in any Part of the World, have ≈øeen ≈øuch a Sea as runs here; we expected every Wave to ≈øwallow us, and the Boat to founder. This Shore is full of ≈ømall I≈ølands, rocks and Breakers; ≈øo that we can't haul further to the South<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, for fear of endangering the Boat; we are oblig'd to keep her right before the Sea. At Five broach'd to, at which we all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liev'd ≈øhe would never ri≈øe again. We were ≈øurrounded with rocks, and ≈øo near that a Man might to≈øs a Bi≈øket on them: We had
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:007859_0161_102DDB85A3815330"/>nothing but Death before our Eyes, and every Moment expected our Fate. It blew a Hurricane of Wind, with thick rainy Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that we could not ≈øee twice the Boat's Length; we pray'd earne≈øtly for its clearing up, for nothing el≈øe could ≈øave us from pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ri≈øhing; we no ≈øooner a≈øk'd for Light, but it was granted us from above. At the Weather's clearing up, we ≈øaw the Land on the North-Shore, with I≈ølands, Rocks, and Breakers all around us; we were obliged to put in among 'em for Shelter, finding it impo≈ø≈øible to keep the Sea; we were in with the Land among≈øt them, and compell'd to pu≈øh thro', looking Death in the Face, and expecting every Sea to bury us; the bolde≈øt Men among us were di≈ømay'd, nor can we po≈ø≈øibly give an Account in what Manner we have been this Day deliver'd. After ≈øailing amid≈øt I≈ølands, rocks, and Breakers, for above a League, we got ≈øafe into a good Harbour, ≈øurrounded with ≈ømall I≈ølands, which kept the Sea off; here the Water was as ≈ømooth as in a Mill-pond. We call this Harbour the <hi>Port of God's Mercy,</hi> e≈øteeming our Pre≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation this Day to be a Miracle. The mo≈øt abandon'd among us no longer doubt of an

            <p>
               <hi>Wedne≈øday</hi> the 11th, The Wind much abated, with rain. This Morning weigh'd and ran farther in. In the Evening we ≈øaw two <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> lying on their Bellies on the Top of a ≈øteep rock, ju≈øt over the Ve≈ø≈øel, peeping with their Heads over the Hill. As ≈øoon as we di≈øcover'd them, we made Motions to them to come down; they then ro≈øe up, and put on their Heads white feather'd Caps; we then hoi≈øted a white Sheet for an En≈øign; at this they made a Noi≈øe, pronouncing <hi>Orza, Orza;</hi> which we took for a Signal to come a≈øhore. We would not ≈øuffer above two Men to go a≈øhore, and tho≈øe di≈øarm'd, le≈øt we ≈øhould put them in Fear. The <hi>Indians</hi> had nothing in their Hands but a Club, like to our Cricket-Batts, with which they kill their Seal. As ≈øoon as they ≈øaw the two Men come a≈øhore, they walk'd away; and when they perceiv'd our Men follow'd them, and gain'd Ground of them, they took to their Heels, frequently looking back, crying <hi>Orza, Orza,</hi> beckoning the People to follow, which they did for a Mile or two along Shore, out of Sight of the Ve≈ø≈øel: Then the <hi>Indians</hi> fled to the Woods, ≈øtill wanting our
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:007859_0163_102DDB89C0EA40C0"/>People to follow them; but being di≈øarm'd, they were apprehen≈øive the <hi>Indians</hi> would Bu≈øh-fight them; ≈øo they thought proper to give over the Pur≈øuit, and to return to the Boat.</p>

The two <hi>Indians</hi> got into the Canoe, and put her off the Shore before we could get nigh them; as ≈øoon as we got a-brea≈øt of the Canoe, they made Signs as if they wanted Cloathing; we en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour'd to make them under≈øtand we wanted Fi≈øh, and would truck with them; they had none, but ≈øignified to us they would go and get ≈øome: They had a mangey Dog, which they parted with to one of the People for a Pair of Cloth Trow≈øers; this Dog was ≈øoon kill'd, dre≈øs'd, and devour'd.

This Night departed this Life Mr. <hi>Thomas Caple,</hi> Son of the late Lieutenant <hi>Caple,</hi> aged twelve Years, who peri≈øh'd for want of Food. There was a Per≈øon on Board who had ≈øome of the Youth's Money, upwards of twenty Guineas, with a Watch and Silver Cup.

Per≈øons who have not experienc'd the Hard≈øhips we have met with, will wonder how People can be ≈øo inhuman to ≈øee their Fellow-Creatures ≈øtarving before their Faces, and afford 'em no relief: But Hunger is void of all Compa≈ø≈øion: every Per≈øon was ≈øo intent on the Pre≈øervation of his own Life, that he was regardle≈øs of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's, and the Bowels of Commi≈øeration were ≈øhut up. We ≈ølip no Opportunity, Day or Night, to enter into the ≈øuppo≈øed right <hi>Streights,</hi> but can get no Ground.

               <hi>Tue≈øday</hi> the 24th, This Morning, it being calm, row'd out; at Eight o'Clock had the ≈øuppo≈øed right <hi>Streights</hi> open, having a Breeze at W. N. W. S.

Before you come to tho≈øe I≈ølands there is a Sound lying on the South-≈øhore: You can ≈øee no Sea-Pa≈ø≈øage until you come clo≈øe up with the I≈øland, and then the imaginary <hi>Streights</hi> are not above two Miles broad. Steer'd a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way for the I≈øland S.

The Wind took us a-head, and the Tide being ≈øpent, we put into a ≈ømall Cove, and made fa≈øt. At Seven in the Evening, being calm, ca≈øt loo≈øe, being willing to ≈øee if there was any Opening; but, to our great Misfortune, found none; which very much ≈øurpriz'd us. The Lieutenant is of Opinion, that we are in a <hi>Lagoon</hi> to the Northward of the <hi>Streights.</hi> This I cannot believe; and am po≈øitive, if ever there was ≈øuch a Place in the World as the <hi>Streights of Magellan,</hi> we are now in them and above thirty Leagues up. If he, or any of the Officers, had given them≈øelves the Trouble of coming upon Deck,
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:007859_0170_102DDB9831C55D10"/>to have made proper remarks, we had been free from all this Perplexity, and by this Time out of the <hi>Streights</hi> to the Northward. There is not an Officer aboard, except the Carpenter and my≈øelf, will keep the Deck a Moment longer than this Watch, or has any regard to a reckoning, or any Thing el≈øe. It is agreed to go back again.</p>

               <hi>Friday</hi> the 11th, At Three this Morning the Boat ≈øtruck upon the Tide of Ebb; it ebbing ≈øo fa≈øt, we could not get her off; in a Quarter of an Hour's Time the Boat was dry; we were favour'd with little Wind and ≈ømooth Water, otherwi≈øe ≈øhe mu≈øt have ≈øtove to Pieces, the Ground being very foul; it ebbs dry above a League off, and there is Shoal Water a great deal further out; ≈øo that it is dangerous for a Ship to haul into this Bay. While the Boat was dry, got all the Water-Ca≈øks out of the Hold, and put them a≈øhore to be fill'd. At ≈øix haul'd the Boat off, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving receiv'd no Damage; at Eight, it being four Feet Flood, run the Boat clo≈øe in Shore, and took off our Water, the whole Quantity being four Tons, out of which we were oblig'd to leave two Puncheons, one Quarter-Ca≈øk, with three Mu≈økets, a Funnel, and ≈øome other Nece≈ø≈øaries; and were very much concern'd, le≈øt we ≈øhould al≈øo leave ≈øome of the People a≈øhore.

On Sight of this, we anchor'd within a Mile of the Shore. The Cape bore <hi>W. S.

The next Morning we ≈øteer'd in for the Bay, and ≈øaw tho≈øe People again; but the Wind ≈øoon afterwards veering to the We≈øtward, and blowing ≈øtrong, we were oblig'd to bear away: We could not by any Means come to the Knowledge of the≈øe Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; whether they are unfortunate Creatures that have been ca≈øt away, or whether they are Inhabitants about the river <hi>Gallegoes,</hi> we can't tell.</p>

                  <hi>The Penguin is a Fowl that lives by catching and eating of Fi≈øh, which he dives for, and is very nimble in the Water; he is as big as a Brant-Goo≈øe, and weighs near about eight Pounds; they have no Wings, but flat Stumps like Fins; their Coat is a downy ≈ølumped Feather; they are blacki≈øh Grey on the Backs and

               </q> We ≈øteer'd N.

I told him, as for a Chart, we had none of any kind; but I had a good Ob≈øervation the Day before, that our Ve≈ø≈øel drew but a ≈ømall Draught of Water; that we kept the Lead always going, and in the Nece≈ø≈øity we were in, we were oblig'd, at all Events, to ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and if we had not ≈øeen the Opening of the river before Night, we mu≈øt have been compell'd to run the Ve≈ø≈øel a≈øhore. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amin'd me al≈øo concerning the Places we ≈øtopt at, from Cape <hi>Virgin Mary</hi> to this Port, and more particularly relating to the river <hi>Plate.</hi> He was very nice in his Enquiry of our put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in at Cape St. <hi>Mary's,</hi> and of the Bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Di≈øtance along Shore from thence to this Port. When he throughly ≈øatisfy'd him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, he embraced us, and ble≈øt him≈øelf to think of our Deliverance, which he term'd a Miracle. He offer'd every Thing the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try could afford to our relief; the Sick were order'd to be taken Care of in the Ho≈øpital. He took the Lieutenant and the Land Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers home with him; and de≈øired the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant to ≈øee that the re≈øt of the Officers and People wanted for nothing. Before he went he inform'd us, that his Maje≈øty's Ships
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:007859_0204_102DDBD5346698B8"/>the <hi>Severn</hi> and <hi>Pearl</hi> were at <hi>Rio Janeiro,</hi> in great Di≈øtre≈øs; that they had ≈øent to <hi>England</hi> for Men, and could not ≈øail from thence until the Arrival of the <hi>Flota,</hi> which would be in <hi>May</hi> or <hi>June.</hi> He al≈øo told us, that we ≈øhould be di≈øpatch'd in the fir≈øt Ve≈ø≈øel which arriv'd in this Port; for he did not think we could with Safety go any farther in our own; and that there could not be found twelve Seamen in the <hi>Brazils</hi> that would venture over the Bar in her to ≈øail to <hi>Rio Janeiro;</hi> therefore he order'd our little <hi>Speedwell</hi> a≈øhore; this Wonder the People are continually flocking to ≈øee: and it is now about nine Months ≈øince we were ca≈øt away in the <hi>Wager;</hi> in which Time, I believe, no Mortals have experienc'd more Difficulties and Mi≈øeries than we have.

I told them he ≈øat down, and clap'd his Feet again≈øt the ri≈øe; and ≈øhow'd them in what Manner we ≈øecured our≈øelves. The Governor, after viewing the Ve≈ø≈øel over, told us, we were more welcome to him in the mi≈øerable Condition we arriv'd, than if we had brought all the Wealth in the World with us. At the ≈øame Time he fully a≈ø≈øur'd us, we ≈øhould be ≈øupply'd with every Thing that the Country could afford; that he would di≈øpatch us the fir≈øt Opportunity to <hi>Rio Janeiro;</hi> and whenever we ≈øtood in Need of any Thing, he order'd us to acquaint the Commandant, and our Wants ≈øhould be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtantly ≈øupply'd. He then took Leave of us, and wi≈øh'd us well. All the Deference and dutiful re≈øpect we could ≈øhow him, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs a grateful Sen≈øe of his Favour, was by manning the Ve≈ø≈øel, and giving him three Cheers.

The Soldiers of the Garri≈øon, having twenty Months Arrears due to them, expected the Brigadier was come to pay them; but when they found them≈øelves di≈øappointed, they made a great Di≈øturbance among them≈øelves. I apply'd to the Commandant for a Hou≈øe, the Ve≈ø≈øel, in rainy Weather, not being fit to lie in; he order'd me one joining to his own, and gave me the Key. I took with me Mr. <hi>Cummins,</hi> Mr. <hi>Jones,</hi> Mr. <hi>Snow,</hi> Mr. <hi>Oakley,</hi> and the Cooper; we brought our trifling Nece≈ø≈øaries on Shore, and remov'd to our new Habitation: Here we were dry and warm; and tho' we had no Bedding, we lodg'd very comfortably. Since the Lo≈øs of the <hi>Wager,</hi> we have been u≈øed to lie hard; at pre≈øent we think our≈øelves very happily fix'd, and heartily wi≈øh that all the Per≈øons who ≈øurviv'd the Lo≈øs of the Ship were in ≈øo good a Situation as our≈øelves.</p>

               <hi>Tue≈øday, February</hi> the 2d, 1741-2, Great Murmurings among the Soldiers; they de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd the Brigadier from going back as he intended this Morning, till he promis'd to di≈øpatch the Money, Cloaths, and Provi≈øions, and to ≈øee their Grievances adju≈øted. On
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:007859_0207_102DDBDB4F9C8178"/>tho≈øe Terms they have agreed he ≈øhall go; and this Evening he return'd for St. <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>'s. We apprehended, till now, that the right Officers were in Place; but we find our≈øelves mi≈øtaken. Some Time before we arrived here, there was an In≈øurrection among the Soldiers: Their De≈øign was again≈øt the Governor; but by his Addre≈øs, and fair Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈øes of ≈øeeing them righted, he diverted the Storm from him≈øelf, and got him≈øelf conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in his Station; as were al≈øo the Major and Commi≈ø≈øary. The Soldiers di≈ømi≈øs'd the re≈øt of the Officers, and ≈øupply'd their Places with their own People, tho' they were lately private Men; they appear'd very grand, and were not di≈øtingui≈øh'd in Dre≈øs from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Officers. The Di≈øturbance at <hi>Rio Grand</hi> is of no Service to us, for we feel the Effects of it; our Allowance is now ≈øo ≈ømall that it will hardly ≈øupport Nature; the People have been without <hi>Farina,</hi> which is their Bread, for ≈øome Days pa≈øt. We apply'd to the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, who promis'd to ≈øupply us the next Day; accordingly we went for a Supply, which created fre≈øh Murmurings among the Soldiers; however we got a ≈ømall Quantity of Bread to ≈øupply us for ten Days. The Store-keeper ≈øhow'd me all the Provi≈øions,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:007859_0208_102DDBDD3A8BA008"/>which, con≈øidering there were a thou≈øand to draw their Sub≈øi≈øtence from it, was a ≈ømall Stock indeed, and not above ≈øix Weeks at the pre≈øent Allowance. He told me we were ≈øerv'd equally with the Soldiers; and when more Stores came, which they ≈øhortly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, our Allowance ≈øhould be encreas'd. I think, in rea≈øon, this is as much as we can expect. The Lieutenant not coming nigh us ≈øince our fir≈øt landing, I went with the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple up to him at the Governor's, about two Miles from this Port, to endeavour to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail with him to get us di≈øpatch'd, acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him of the Call and Nece≈ø≈øity there was for our A≈ø≈øi≈øtance on Board the two di≈øtre≈øs'd Ships at <hi>Rio Janeiro.</hi> He ≈øaid he had ≈øpoke to the Governor, and could not get us di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patch'd till another Ve≈ø≈øel came in. I told him, as the Garri≈øon were in want of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øions, what we were living on here, would carry us off; and if any Misfortune ≈øhould attend the Ve≈ø≈øel expected in with the Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions, we ≈øhould be put very hard to it for a Sub≈øi≈øtence. He promis'd to acquaint the Governor; on which I took my Leave.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>February</hi> the 17th, This Evening came into this Garri≈øon three Seamen, giving an Account of their belonging to a Ve≈ø≈øel with
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:007859_0209_102DDBDF30B60050"/>Provi≈øions and Stores for this Place, from <hi>Rio Janeiro;</hi> that they had been from thence three Months, and had been off the Bar waiting an Opportunity to come in; that not having any fre≈øh Water aboard, they were oblig'd to come to an Anchor ten Leagues to the Southward of this Port; that a Canoe was ≈øent with tho≈øe three Men to fill the Water, but the Wind coming in from the Sea, and blowing hard, oblig'd the Ve≈ø≈øel to put to Sea, and leave them a≈øhore, from whence they travelled here, and believ'd the Ve≈ø≈øel was gone to St. <hi>Catharine</hi>'s. The Governor, not ≈øatisfy'd with their report, took them for Spies, and kept them as ≈øuch. However, in a Day or two afterwards, he di≈øpatch'd a Pilot and two Seamen for the I≈øland St. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine,</hi> to bring the Ve≈ø≈øel round, in Ca≈øe ≈øhe ≈øhould be there.</p>
            <p>I took this Opportunity of ≈øending a Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter by them to the Honourable Capt. <hi>Murray,</hi> Commander of his Maje≈øty's Ship the <hi>Pearl,</hi> at <hi>Rio Janeiro;</hi> de≈øiring them to order it to be di≈øpatch'd by the fir≈øt Ship from St. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine</hi>'s to the <hi>Rio Janeiro.</hi>

This is evident, that the Governor was right in his Conjecture, and did not ≈øu≈øpect them wrongfully; they are now Pri≈øoners in the Guard-Hou≈øe. The next Morning I went to the Lieutenant, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øiring him to apply to the Governor for a Pa≈øs and Hor≈øes for my≈øelf, Mr. <hi>Cummins,</hi> and <hi>John Young,</hi> to go by Land to St. <hi>Catha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine</hi>'s and St. <hi>Franci≈øco;</hi> where we need not doubt of a Pa≈ø≈øage to his Maje≈øty's di≈øtre≈øs'd Ships at <hi>Rio Janeiro:</hi> That it was our Duty to ha≈øten to their A≈ø≈øi≈øtance: That he, the Lieutenant, ought, the very Day after our Arrival into this Port, without any regard

The Lieutenant an≈øwer'd, he had a Thought of enquiring at fir≈øt coming about what I had mention'd, and of going him≈øelf, tho' it co≈øt him fifty Pounds; but he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd it was impo≈ø≈øible to go by Land.

As for Fatigue or Trouble, whoever undertook to go, he mu≈øt expect that; but there was no Hard≈øhip to be encounter'd comparable to what we had already undergone. We lay here on Expence to the King, without doing any Service, and run the Hazard of not only lo≈øing the Opportunity of getting on Board our own Ships, but perhaps of mi≈ø≈øing the <hi>Flota,</hi> and of wintering here; therefore I beg'd he would entreat the Governor to let us have Hor≈øes and Guides; which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd to mention to the Governor at Dinner, and ≈øend me his An≈øwer in the Afternoon without fail.

                  <p>I Am ≈øorry you ≈øhould give me the Liberty of telling you, you have not di≈øcharg'd your Promi≈øe, by letting us know the Governor's An≈øwer to what we reque≈øted: Which was, at our Expence and Charge, to go to the A≈ø≈øi≈øtance of his Maje≈øty's Ships at <hi>Rio Janeiro;</hi> ≈øince which Time I am to inform you that we are in want of Provi≈øion, having none of any kind allow'd us Ye≈øter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and but one ≈ømall Fi≈øh <hi>per</hi> Man for two Days before. The Meaning of which I believe is owing to you, by the endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, through the Per≈øua≈øions of the Per≈øons you confide in, to blacken us, and in ≈øo vile a Manner, that you ≈øeem unacquainted with the ill Con≈øequence, which may attend the touching a Man's Character.

If I am not mi≈øtaken, you told me that what we were ≈øupply'd with here, was a Bounty flowing from the
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:007859_0215_102DDBED77D1D738"/>generous Spirit of the Governor, and the Gentlemen of the Place. If this be the Ca≈øe, we ought to be very thankful indeed. I am ≈øurprized, Sir, you don't ≈øee the Grievances of the Inhabitants here, and hear the Soldiers Murmurings for want of their Arrears. If they ≈øhould revolt at this Juncture, we ≈øhall ≈øtand a very bad Chance. I mu≈øt acquaint you, Sir, the Ve≈ø≈øel we came in, is not ≈øo much out of repair, but that, if you can get Canvas out of the Store for Sails, we can make 'em, and get ready for ≈øailing in ten Days Time. And if the Ve≈ø≈øel expected here with Supplies comes in a ≈øhorter Time, our Ve≈ø≈øel will be ready fix'd for the U≈øe of the Governor; and if one Ve≈ø≈øel ≈øhould not be large enough to carry us all off, we can go in Company.

The next Morning the Lieutenaut came down on Hor≈øe-back, being the fir≈øt Time of his appearing among us ≈øince we have been here, which is above three Weeks; we went with him to the Commandant, who promi≈øed we ≈øhould not want fre≈øh Beef and Fi≈øh; but as for Bread, there is none to be got. <hi>William Oram,</hi> one of the Carpenter's Crew, died this Day in the Ho≈øpital.</p>

               <hi>March</hi> the 9th, This Morning Mr. <hi>Jones</hi> went over with me to the North Side, to make an Agreement for ≈øix People to go to St. <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tharine</hi>'s; while we were here, the Governor received Letters from St. <hi>Catharine</hi>'s, which gave an Account of four Ve≈ø≈øels on their Pa≈ø≈øage for this Port; on the News of this we put by our Journey: It was very lucky we had not ≈øet out on this Journey before we heard the News: For on the nineteenth the Ve≈ø≈øels from <hi>Rio Janeiro</hi> arrived, and brought an Account that the <hi>Severn</hi> and <hi>Pearl</hi> were ≈øail'd from thence for the I≈øland of <hi>Barbadoes.</hi> Tho≈øe Ve≈ø≈øels not only brought the Soldiers Provi≈øions, but al≈øo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

On the 20th, The Brigadier arriv'd, and had all the Soldiers drawn up, where their Pardon was read to them: He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted them with what Money was come, which was not above a third Part of their Arrears, but the remainder was on the Pa≈ø≈øage. The Money he had for them ≈øhould be paid directly as far as it would go, if they would take it; but they cry'd out with one Voice, The Whole or none; and a great Di≈øturbance there was, ≈øome were for revolting to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> ≈øome began to change their Notes, and were for taking Part of the Money, and the re≈øt in≈øi≈øted upon the Whole. To quell this Di≈øturbance, the Commandant, whom they look'd upon more than the Brigadier, or the Governor, u≈øed his utmo≈øt Endeavours. They told the Commandant they were no longer Soldiers than while they were in the King's Pay, and let tho≈øe who are for the King, draw off one Way by them≈øelves; you are our Commander, we tru≈øt in you to an≈øwer for us, what you do we will ≈øtand by with our Lives: On which the Commandant deliver'd his Command up, ≈øhouldering his Firelock, and took the Place of a common Soldier, telling
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:007859_0219_102DDBF62C2452D0"/>them, ≈øince the King was ≈øo good as to pardon them, he thought it his Duty to accept it; the Brigadier was ≈øo well plea≈øed with the Behaviour of the Commandant, that he ran to him, took him in his Arms, and embraced him; the re≈øt of the Soldiers follow'd the Example of their late Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandant, delivering their re≈øpective Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands up to their proper Officers. This Day put an End to the Di≈øturbance and Confu≈øion which had been ≈øome Time among them, and re≈øtor'd them to Tranquility, good Di≈øcipline, and Order.</p>

               <hi>March</hi> the 22d, This Morning went to the Lieutenant for Leave to go in the fir≈øt Ve≈ø≈øel, which was expected to ≈øail in four Days time; he told me he expected to go in her him≈øelf, and that we could not go off all in one Ve≈ø≈øel; there might be room for the Officers, but the People mu≈øt wait another Opportunity. I told him that it was a Duty incumbent on the Officers that were in Pay, particularly, to take Care of the People; you, Sir, have been ≈øure of half Pay ever ≈øince the Ship was lo≈øt; we are not, but I will tarry my≈øelf behind with the People, and be an≈øwerable for them, if you'll give me a Not<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Governor told us it was order'd that the Land Officers, my≈øelf and the re≈øt that apply'd to go by Land, ≈øhould be the fir≈øt di≈øpatch'd, and might go on board when we would; but as the Ve≈ø≈øel did not belong to the King, we mu≈øt buy Provi≈øions, and pay for our Pa≈ø≈øage. I ≈øaid, Sir, we have not Money to an≈øwer the Expence: He then a≈øk'd me whether I had not ≈øeveral Times apply'd to him for Leave to go by Land at my own Charges? I an≈øwer'd, we were oblig'd to di≈øpo≈øe of our Watches to rai≈øe that Money, which will barely be ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to carry us ≈øix off that intended to go by Land, therefore what mu≈øt become of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

On my ≈øaying this, the Governor call'd the Commi≈ø≈øary and Major; he walk'd and talk'd with them a≈øide; then came back again, and told us the Account was ≈øo ≈ømall, that it was not worth charging the King of <hi>England</hi> with it; therefore we mu≈øt buy our own Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions, and pay our Pa≈ø≈øage; and as to what we had receiv'd from them, we were wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; upon which we thank'd them, and came away. We then con≈øulted with the Lieutenant, to know what could be done with the People; and that as the Ve≈ø≈øel we came in was not fit to proceed in any farther, it was to no Purpo≈øe to leave her there; therefore we de≈øired his con≈øent to ≈øell her, believing the Money ≈øhe would bring, would be ≈øufficient to carry us all off. To this Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øal the Lieutenant con≈øented. We then apply'd to the Ma≈øter of the Ve≈ø≈øel, to know what he would have for our Pa≈ø≈øage; his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand was forty Shillings <hi>per</hi> Man; of which we acquainted the Lieutenant, who told us he could not ≈øee what we could do, and, on ≈øecond Con≈øideration, would not give his Con≈øent to ≈øell the Boat; for, when ≈øold, he did not think ≈øhe would fetch the Money.
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:007859_0222_102DDBFEB3B70380"/>Tho≈øe Words of the Lieutenant put us all to a Stand, e≈øpecially after he had but now given his Con≈øent to ≈øell her; and in ≈øo ≈øhort Time to declare the rever≈øe, was very odd; tho' indeed it did not much ≈øurprize us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cau≈øe this Gentleman was never known to be over ≈øtedfa≈øt to his Word. Seeing no Po≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of carrying he People off without ≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling the Boat, I told the Lieutenant, if he left them behind, I could not think but ≈øo many of his Maje≈øty's Subjects were ≈øold; and believ'd he had made a Pre≈øent of the Ve≈ø≈øel to the Governor. At this the Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant paus'd for a while; and then ≈øaid, he had not Money to carry him≈øelf off without ≈øelling his Coat. I reply'd, there was no Occa≈øion for that, when he had a Gold Watch. The next Morning went to the Lieutenant again about our going off; he acquainted us, that the Brigadier had order'd Things in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Manner; that myfelf, and nine more, being the Per≈øons di≈øirous of going, ≈øhould be di≈øpatch'd in the fir≈øt Ve≈ø≈øel, and every Thing found us; that he, the Lieutenant, was to tarry behind with the re≈øt of the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and to come in the next Ve≈ø≈øel, an E≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate of the Charges being made out; and al≈øo he told us, he had a ≈øevere Check for

               <hi>Tue≈øday</hi> the 13th, This Morning we were all order'd before the Governor. A <hi>Dutch</hi> Surgeon was ≈øent for, who ≈øpoke very good <hi>Engli≈øh.</hi> After an Enquiry into our Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes, the Governor order'd him to be our Con≈øul; telling us, that we ≈øhould have a convenient Hou≈øe, with Firing, and eight Vintins a Man <hi>per</hi> Day Sub≈øi≈øtence-Money: He al≈øo de≈øir'd we might make no Di≈øturbance among our≈øelves; which we promis'd to avoid. A Nobleman went with the Con≈øul to look out for our Habitation; they fix'd on a large magnificent Hou≈øe, fit for a Per≈øon of Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity. This being the fir≈øt Day of our coming a≈øhore, they were pleas'd to order a Dinner,
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:007859_0225_102DDC0543A33A88"/>and Supper out of Doors, and ≈øent us where we were to eat all together. This was the fir≈øt Time of the Boat≈øwain's eating with the re≈øt of the Officers ≈øince we left <hi>Cheap</hi> I≈øland. The Con≈øul was ≈øo kind as to ≈øend us a Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, Benches, Water Pots, and ≈øeveral u≈øeful Things, from his own Hou≈øe; we thought our≈øelves very happily ≈øeated.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Wedne≈øday</hi> the 14th, This Morning the Con≈øul went with the Officers and People to the Trea≈øury for our Money. Mr. <hi>Oakley,</hi> Surgeon of his Maje≈øty's Land Forces, was de≈øired by the Con≈øul to ≈øign for it. The Boat≈øwain, who now look'd upon him≈øelf as our Captain, was not a little di≈øpleas'd at this. When the Money was received, the Con≈øul would have given it the Surgeon to pay us; but he excus'd him≈øelf, telling the Con≈øul the Boat≈øwain was a trouble≈øome Man, and it might occa≈øion a Di≈øturbance; on which the Con≈øul was ≈øo good as to come and pay it him≈øelf. Being all together, he told us the Governor had order'd us eight Vintins a Man <hi>per</hi> Day; but at the ≈øame Time had made a Di≈øtinction between the Officers and Seamen; that the Money re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived was to be paid in the Manner follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>viz.</hi> to the Seamen ≈øix Vintins <hi>per</hi> Man,
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:007859_0226_102DDC0742193370"/>and the Officers ten. The rea≈øon of this Di≈øtinction was, that the Seamen could go to work, and get Money by their Labour; when the Officers could not, but mu≈øt be obliged to live entirely on their Allowance. This Di≈øtinction cau≈øed great Unea≈øine≈øs, the Boat≈øwain in≈øi≈øting that the People had a right to an equal Share with us. The Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, willing to make all Things ea≈øy, de≈øir'd the Con≈øul it might be ≈øo. The Con≈øul re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply'd, the Money ≈øhould be di≈øpos'd of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Governor's Direction, or not at all. The Boat≈øwain then objected again≈øt the Cooper, becau≈øe he was no Office<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
               </gap>. The Con≈øul ≈øaid, Ma≈øter! I believe the Cooper to be a very good quiet Man, and I dare ≈øay will take it as the Men do; but ≈øooner than this be an Objection, I will pay the Money out of my own Pocket. The Boat≈øwain then began at me, abu≈øing me in a very ≈øcanda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and abominable Manner; ≈øaying, among other Things; that the Cooper was got among the re≈øt of the Pirates, for ≈øo he term'd me and the re≈øt of the Officers. When the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney was paid, we acquainted the Con≈øul, that we had, till now, been ≈øeparated from the Boat≈øwain; that he was of ≈øo perver≈øe and turbulent a Temper, and ≈øo abu≈øive in Speech,
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:007859_0227_102DDC09B35382D8"/>that we could not bear with him. The Boat≈øwain then cho≈øe to be with the People, and gave us the Preference of the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, where we de≈øired to be by our≈øelves. There were two Doors to our room; we look'd both of them, and went to take a Walk in the Country: At our return in the Evening, we found the Doors broke open, and a ≈ømall Sword belonging to me was bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken an Inch off the Point, and the Scabbard all in Pieces. The Boat≈øwain had in his room an <hi>Iri≈øhman,</hi> whom he ≈øent in on Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe to quarrel with us. This <hi>Iri≈øhman</hi> and <hi>Richard Ea≈øt,</hi> one of our own People, fell upon the Cooper and me: <hi>Ea≈øt</hi> cho≈øe to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with me; he ≈øtruck me ≈øeveral Times; he compell'd me to ≈øtand in my own Defence, and I ≈øoon ma≈øter'd him. During this Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rel the Carpenter call'd the Guards; at Sight of whom the <hi>Iri≈øhman</hi> made his E≈øcape. I de≈øir'd the Guards to ≈øecure <hi>Ea≈øt</hi> a Pri≈øoner, but the Officer told me he could not, unle≈øs I would go to Pri≈øon with him. I told him it was my de≈øire, and accordingly I went. The Pri≈øon was in the Governor's Hou≈øe. I had not been there but a few Minutes before the Governor ≈øent for me; he enquired of the Officer concerning the Di≈øturbance, and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:007859_0228_102DDC0C00FB4438"/>me to my Habitation; but detain'd <hi>Ea≈øt</hi> a Pri≈øoner. When I came Home I found the Boat≈øwain, and two renegadoes with him, all about the Cooper. On ≈øeeing me, he repeated his former abu≈øive Words. He made us ≈øo unea≈øy in our Lodging, that, to prevent Murder, we were oblig'd to lie out of the Hou≈øe. Next Morning Mr. <hi>Oakley</hi> and Mr. <hi>Cummins</hi> went to the Con≈øul; he came with them to the Hou≈øe, where we were all ≈øent for; he told us it was very ≈øtrange, that People who had undergone ≈øo many Hard≈øhips and Difficulties, could not agree lovingly together. We an≈øwer'd, we never us'd to me≈øs together; and ≈øooner than we would be with the Boat≈øwain, we would make it our Choice to take a Hou≈øe in the Country at our own Expence. The Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwain, on hearing this, fell again into his u≈øual Strain of Slander and abu≈øive Language, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us rogues, Villains, and Pirates. It was the Governor's fir≈øt reque≈øt, that we might have no Di≈øturbance among us; yet the Boat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwain hath not ≈øuffer'd us to have a quiet Minute ≈øince we have been here. The Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øul went with us two Miles out of the City, at a ≈øi≈øhing Village; where we took a Hou≈øe, at our own Expence, to pay at the rate of
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:007859_0229_102DDC0DCB752AA0"/>ten Shillings <hi>per</hi> Month, there being ≈øeven of us in all, <hi>viz.</hi> my≈øelf, the Carpenter, Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon, the two Mates, the Cooper, and a Seaman. Here we thought our≈øelves ≈øafe and ≈øecure. The next Day, in the After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, two of the Boat≈øwain's Friends, which had lately de≈øerted from his Maje≈øty's Service, and an <hi>Iri≈øh</hi> Clerk with them, came to pay us a Vi≈øit. They were ≈øo impertinent, as not only to enquire into the rea≈øons of the Di≈øturbance among our≈øelves, but they al≈øo in≈øtructed us in our Duty, telling us, they came from our Commander the Boat≈øwain, with Orders to ≈øee our Journal. I told them the Journal ≈øhould not be a Secret to any Per≈øon who could read; but at the ≈øame Time I would never part with it to be copied out: They then drank a Gla≈øs of Punch with us and left us. This is a Place that a Man is oblig'd ≈øometimes to ≈øuffer him≈øelf to be u≈øed ill; if he re≈øents all Affronts, he runs a great Hazard of lo≈øing his Life; for here ruf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fians are to be hired at a ≈ømall Expence; and there is no Place in the World where People will commit Murder at ≈øo cheap a rate. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Nine and Ten at Night, three People, came to our Door; one of which knock'd, telling us that he was the Per≈øon that was
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:007859_0230_102DDC10314B3F58"/>with me and the Cooper in the Afternoon. Being apprehen≈øive that they came with no good Intent, we refus'd opening the Door; telling them, that it was an improper Sea≈øon of the Night, and that we did not know they had any Bu≈øine≈øs with us; if they had, we told them to come in the Morning: But they ≈øtill in≈øi≈øted upon the Door being open'd; ≈øaying, it would be better to do ≈øo, than to be taken away in three Hours Time. When they had ≈øaid this, they went away. We did not know the Meaning of their Words, but imagin'd they were gone to bring ≈øome A≈ø≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciates to be≈øet the Hou≈øe; having nothing to defend our≈øelves with, we got over the Back-Wall of the Hou≈øe, and took to the Country for Safety: In the Morning apply'd to the Con≈øul, who remov'd us to a Hou≈øe in the Mid≈øt of the Village; he gave an Account to the Inhabitants of the De≈øign the Boat≈øwain had form'd again≈øt us, either to compel us to deliver up the Journal, or to take our Lives; he therefore de≈øired that the Journal and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers might be depo≈øited in the Hands of a Neighbour there, till the Time of our going off. The People of the Place offer'd to ≈øtand by us with their Lives, in Oppo≈øition to any

               <hi>Wedne≈øday</hi> the 21≈øt, Early this Morning the Captain came on Board; on ≈øeeing us, he a≈øk'd us, How we came on Board without his Leave? Notwith≈øtanding he gave Leave to the Con≈øul for our Pa≈ø≈øage, we ought to have waited on him a≈øhore. There was on Board the Ship a <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Don, a Pa≈ø≈øenger, who told the Captain no <hi>Engli≈øhman</hi> ≈øhould go in the ≈øame Ship with him; therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øired we might be turn'd a≈øhore; but the Captain in≈øi≈øted upon doing what he pleas'd aboard his own Ship, and would not comply with his reque≈øt. The <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Don, when we came to conver≈øe with him, was very much mov'd with the relation of our Mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunes; and ≈øaid to us, though our royal Ma≈øters, the Kings of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> are at War, it was not our Fault; that we were now on Board a Neutral Ship belonging to a King who was a Friend to both Nations;
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:007859_0238_102DDC21AEAE7468"/>that he would not look upon us as Enemies, but do us all the Service he could. He ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toll'd the Conduct and Bravery of Admiral <hi>Vernon</hi> at <hi>Porto-Bello;</hi> but, above all, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauded him for his Humanity and generous Treatment of his Enemies. He made great Encomiums on the Magnificence of the <hi>Briti≈øh</hi> Fleet, and the Boldne≈øs and Imtrepidity of the Sailors, ≈øtiling the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> the <hi>Soldiers of the Sea.</hi> He ≈øupplied us in our Pa≈ø≈øage not only with Provi≈øions from his Table, but al≈øo with Wine and Brandy; and during the whole Voyage appear'd ≈øo different from an Enemy, that he took all Opportunities of giving us Proofs of his Genero≈øity and Goodne≈øs.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Friday</hi> the 7th of <hi>May</hi> 1742, This Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing anchor'd before the City of <hi>Bahia,</hi> went on Shore to the Vice-roy, ≈øhew'd him the Pa≈øs we had from the Governor of <hi>Rio Janeiro:</hi> He told us the Pa≈øs was to di≈øpatch us to <hi>Lisbon,</hi> and that the fir≈øt Ship which ≈øail'd from hence would be the Ship we came in; we petition'd him for Provi≈øions, acquainting him of our reception at <hi>Rio Grand,</hi> and <hi>Rio Janeiro,</hi> that we had hitherto been ≈øupply'd at the rate of eight Vintins each Man <hi>per</hi> Day. He refu≈øed ≈øupplying us with any Thing; upon which I told him,
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:007859_0239_102DDC2453C2CEB0"/>we had better been Pri≈øoners to the King of <hi>Spain,</hi> who would allow us Bread and Water, than in a Friend's Country to be ≈øtarv'd. The Captain of the Ship we came in, hearing the Vice-roy would not ≈øupply us, was ≈øo kind as to go with us to him, acquainting him how we were provided for at <hi>Rio Janeiro,</hi> and that he would ≈øupply us him≈øelf, if he would ≈øign an Account to ≈øatisfy the Con≈øul General at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> ≈øo that he might be reimburs'd. The Vice-roy an≈øwer'd, he had no Orders concerning the <hi>Engli≈øh,</hi> that he had Letters from the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> his Ma≈øter to ≈øupply the <hi>French,</hi> but had no Orders about any other Nation, and if he gave us any thing, it mu≈øt be out of his own Pocket, therefore he would not ≈øupply us; The Captain then told him that we were Officers and Subjects to the King of <hi>England,</hi> and in Di≈øtre≈øs; that we did not want great Matters, only barely enough to ≈øupport Life, and begg'd that he would allow but four Vintins <hi>per</hi> Day, being but half the Sum hitherto allow'd us.

            </p>
            <p>Here is a very good Bay for Ships to ride in, with the Wind from the E. S. E. to the Northward and We≈øtward back to the S. W. and Wind to the Southward, which blows in, and makes a very great Sea. At the Ea≈øt Side coming in, ≈øtandeth <hi>Point de Gloria,</hi> where is a very large Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication, with a Tower in the mid≈øt; from this Point the Land ri≈øes gradually; about a League from hence is the City of <hi>Bahia;</hi> it is ≈øurrounded with Fortifications and equally capable of defending it again≈øt any Attempts from the Sea or Lands.</p>
            <p>Provi≈øions her of all kinds are exce≈ø≈øive dear, e≈øpecially Fi≈øh, this we impute to the great Number of Whales that come into this Bay, even where the Ships lie at Anchor; the Whale Boats go off and kill ≈øometimes <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>even or eight Whales in a Day. The Fle≈øh of which is out up in ≈ømall Pieces, then brought to the Market Place, and ≈øold at the rate of a Vintin <hi>per</hi> Pound; it looks very much like coar≈øe Beef, but inferior to it in Ta≈øte. The Whales here are not at all equal in Size to the Whales in <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> being not larger than the Grampus.
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:007859_0245_102DDC2FCDE7F3A8"/>After living here above four Months with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any relief from the Governor or the Inhabitants, who behaved to us as if they were under a Combination to ≈øtarve us, we embark'd on board the St. <hi>Tubes</hi> with our good Friend the Captain who brought us from <hi>Rio Janeiro;</hi> we ≈øail'd from <hi>Bahia</hi> the 11th of <hi>September</hi> for <hi>Lisbon,</hi> in Company with one of the King of <hi>Portugal</hi>'s Ships of War, and two <hi>Ea≈øt-India</hi> Ships; but the St. <hi>Tubas</hi> not being able to ≈øail ≈øo well as the other Ships, lo≈øt ≈øight of them the fir≈øt Night. About 70 Leagues from the We≈øtward of <hi>Madeira,</hi> we bent a new Fore≈øail; within two or three Days afterwards, we had a very hard Gale of Wind, ≈øcudding under the Fore≈øail, and no Danger happening to the Ship during this Gale. When the Wind had ceas'd, and we had fair Weather, the Captain, after the Evening Ma≈øs, made an Oration to the People, telling them that their Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance from Danger in the la≈øt Gale of Wind, and that the Ship though leaky mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no more Water than before, was owing to their Prayers to <hi>Nue≈øtra Senhora Boa Mortua</hi> and her Interce≈ø≈øion. That in Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude they ought to make an Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to that Saint for ≈øtanding their Friend
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:007859_0246_102DDC31E14DF0A0"/>in time of Need. That he him≈øelf would ≈øhew the Example by giving the new Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øail, which was bent to the Yard, to the Saint their Deliverer; accordingly one of the Seamen went forward and mark'd out the≈øe Words on the Sail, <hi>Deal e≈øta Trinckado pour no≈øtra Senhora Boa mortua</hi> (which is as much as to ≈øay) <hi>I give this Fore≈øail to our Saint the Deliverer from Death.</hi> The Sail and Money collected on this Occa≈øion amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to upwards of twenty Moidores.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Monday</hi> the 23d of <hi>November,</hi> in the Latitude 39: 17 North, and Longitude 6: 00 W. that Day at Noon the <hi>Rock</hi> of <hi>Li≈øbon</hi> bearing S. by W. di≈øtant ≈øixteen Leagues; we ≈øteer'd E. S. E. to make the <hi>Rock</hi> before Night. At Four o'Clock it blew a very hard Gale, and right on the Shore; the Ship lay to under a Fore≈øail with her Head to the Southward; at Six it blew a Storm, the Fore≈øail ≈øplitting, oblig'd us to keep her before the Wind, which was running her right on the Shore. The Ship was now given over for lo≈øt, the People all fell to Prayers, and cry'd out to their Saints for Deliverance, offering all they had in the World for their Lives; and yet at the ≈øame time neglected all Means to ≈øave them≈øelves;
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:007859_0247_102DDC34A34480E0"/>they left off pumping the Ship, though ≈øhe was exceeding leaky. This Sort of Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in time of Extremity is a thing unknown to our <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Seamen; in tho≈øe Emergencies all Hands are employ'd for the Pre≈øervation of the Ship and People, and, if any of them fall upon their Knees, 'tis after the Danger is over. The Carpenter and my≈øelf could by no Means reli≈øh this Behaviour, we begg'd the People for God's ≈øake to go to the Pumps, telling them we had a Chance of ≈øaving our Lives, while we kept the Ship above Water, that we ought not to ≈øuffer the Ship to ≈øink, while we could keep her free. The Captain and Officers hearing us pre≈ø≈øing them ≈øo earne≈øtly, le<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

N. W. then the Ship lay South, which would clear the Cour≈øe along Shore had the Wind not ≈øhifted; we mu≈øt in an Hour's time have run the Ship a-≈øhore. This Deliverance, as well as the Former, was owing to the Interce≈ø≈øion of <hi>Nue≈øtra Senhora Boa Mortua:</hi> On this Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca≈øion they collected Fifty Moidores more, and made this pious re≈øolution, that, when
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:007859_0248_102DDC3694BA9078"/>the Ship arriv'd ≈øafe at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øail, which was ≈øplit in the la≈øt Gale of Wind, ≈øhould be carried in Proce≈ø≈øion to the Church of this grand Saint, and the Captain ≈øhould there make an Offering equal in Value to the Fore≈øail, which was reckon'd worth eighteen Moidores.</p>
            <p>On <hi>Saturday</hi> the 28th of <hi>November,</hi> we ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at <hi>Lisbon;</hi> and on the next Morning every Per≈øon who came in the Ship, (except<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Carpenter, my≈øelf; and the Cooper) Officers, Pa≈ø≈øengers, the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Don him≈øelf, and all the People, Men and Boys, walk'd bare-footed, with the Fore-≈øail in Proce≈ø≈øion, to the Church of <hi>Nue≈øtra Senhora Boa Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tua;</hi> the Weather at that Time being very cold, and the Church a good Mile di≈øtant from the Landing-Place.

When I inform'd them that we were three of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate People that were ca≈øt away in the <hi>Wager,</hi> and that we came here in one of the <hi>Brazil</hi> Ships, and wanted to embrace the fir≈øt Opportunity of going to <hi>England;</hi> they told me, that the Lieutenant had been before us; that he was gone home in the Packet Boat,
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:007859_0249_102DDC388BD93FB8"/>and left us a very indifferent Character. I an≈øwer'd, I believ'd the Lieutenant could give but a very bad Account of him≈øelf, having kept no Journal, nor made any remarks ≈øince the Lo≈øs of the Ship, nor perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore; that we doubted not but to acquit our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves of any fal≈øe Accu≈øations, having with us a Journal, which gave an impartial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of all our Proceedings. The Journal was read by ≈øeveral Gentlemen of the Facto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, who treated us, during our Stay at <hi>Lisbon,</hi> with exceeding Kindne≈øs and Benevolence.</p>
            <p>On the 20th of <hi>December,</hi> we embark'd on Board his Maje≈øty's Ship the <hi>Stirling-Ca≈øtle</hi> for <hi>England:</hi> Here we had again the Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of experiencing the Difference between a <hi>Briti≈øh</hi> and a Foreign Ship, particularly in regard to Cleanline≈øs, Accomodation, Diet and Di≈øcipline. We met with nothing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial in our Pa≈ø≈øage, and arrived at <hi>Spithead</hi> on the 1≈øt of <hi>January,</hi> 1742-3. Here we thought of nothing but going a≈øhore im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately to our Families; but were told by the Captain, we mu≈øt not ≈øtir out of the Ship till he knew the Plea≈øure of the Lords of the Admiralty, having already wrote to them con<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>rning us. This was a very great Affliction to us; and the more ≈øo becau≈øe
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:007859_0250_102DDC3AA7EC42B8"/>we thought our Troubles at an End. The Carpenter and my≈øelf were in View of our Habitations; our Families had long given us over for lo≈øt; and, on the News of our Safety, our relatives look'd upon us as Sons, Hu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bands, and Fathers, re≈øtor'd to them in a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous Manner. Our being detain'd on Board gave them great Anxiety; we endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour'd to con≈øole 'em as well as we could; being a≈ø≈øured, that we had done nothing to offend their Lord≈øhips; that, if Things were not carried on with that Order and regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity which is ≈øtrictly ob≈øerv'd in the Navy, Nece≈ø≈øity drove us out of the common road. Our Ca≈øe was ≈øingular: Since the lo≈øs of the Ship, our chiefe≈øt Concern was for the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øervation of our Lives and Liberties; to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compli≈øh which we acted according to the Dictates of Nature, and the be≈øt of our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der≈øtanding.</p>

After publi≈øhing the Work, we were told by many, that we were to be hang'd for Piracy in coming away with the King's Long-boat without the Capt. and al≈øo for mutinying, and not bringing him home with us. There was one great good Man that gave his Judgment in our Favour, ≈øo far as to ≈øay, She was not the King's Long-boat; giving the≈øe rea≈øons: At the fir≈øt

After receiving the above, I proceeded for <hi>Plymouth,</hi> there took charge and fix'd the Ship with Jury Ma≈øts, mu≈øter'd forty Men, and ten Guns. In the middle of July ≈øail'd in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with three Sail bound for <hi>London,</hi> the Ma≈øters whereof engaged with me not to Part Company, being doubtful of falling in with two French Dogger Privateers, which had done a great Deal of Mi≈øchief in the Channel. The next Morning about Six o'Clock, it being little Wind, the <hi>Starts</hi> bearing N.N.W. ≈øaw the two Privateers in cha≈øe of three Ships to the S. in about two Hours after they left off their Chace, and haul'd their Wind, in order to ≈øpeak with us; at which the three Sail be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing within me, haul'd their Wind in order to run their Ve≈ø≈øels on ≈øhore: on this I bore down to the Privateers, run the ten Guns out of the ≈øtarboard Side, and as ≈øoon as with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Gun ≈øhot hoi≈øted the King's Colours and fired a Shot, which they did not regard, by not hoi≈øting any Colours; at which I ordered the Men below to get all ready at once to haul all the lower Deck Ports up, by doing which we'll give them to believe we are in a Man of War, and by having Jury Ma≈øts, will think that we lo≈øt them in an Engagement or bad Weather; as ≈øoon as they acquainted me
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:007859_0260_102DDC510EB6FF90"/>they were ready, I order'd them to haul up, and fired another Shot, which had the de≈øired Effect, for they in≈øtantly hoi≈øted <hi>Swedi≈øh</hi> Colours, and tack'd from us; by which Scheme ≈øix Sail of Merchant Ve≈ø≈øels were ≈øaved from being taken; the Privateers had each a Hundred and Seventeen Men on Board. To the Fact of this I refer to the St. James's Evening Po≈øt, it being publi≈øhed there. In about ten Months after this Captain Cheap arrived in <hi>England</hi> from <hi>France:</hi> The Account he gave of his Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and the Perils and Dangers he went thro' after he was left by us, is as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WHEN the Long-boat and Cutter were gone, the Captain, and tho≈øe who were left with him, propo≈øed to pa≈øs to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward in the Barge and Yawl; But the Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther was ≈øo bad, and the Difficulty of ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øting ≈øo great, that it was two Months af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Departure of the Long-boat before he was able to put to Sea. But as it has been already ≈øaid, the Place where the <hi>Wager</hi> was ca≈øt away, was not a Part of the Conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, but an I≈øland at ≈øome ≈øome di≈øtance from the Main, which afforded no other Sorts of Provi≈øion but Shell-fi≈øh, and a few Herbs; and as the greate≈øt Part of what they had
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:007859_0261_102DDC52FAE30320"/>gotten from the Ship was carried off in the Long-boat, the Captain and his People were often in great Nece≈ø≈øity, e≈øpecially as they cho≈øe to pre≈øerve what little Sea-provi≈øions remained, for their Store when they ≈øhould go to the Northward. During their re≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence at this I≈øland, which was by the Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men denominated <hi>Wager's I≈øland,</hi> they had now and then a ≈øtraggtling Canoe or two of <hi>Indians,</hi> which came and bartered their Fi≈øh and other Provi≈øions with our People. This was indeed ≈øome little Succour, and at ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Sea≈øon might perhaps have been great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; for as there were ≈øeveral <hi>Indian</hi> Huts on the Shore, it was ≈øuppo≈øed that in ≈øome Years, during the height of Summer, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the≈øe Savages might re≈øort thither to fi≈øh.</p>
            <p>Upon the 14th of <hi>December,</hi> the Captain and his People embarked in the Barge and the Yawl, in order to proceed to the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, taking on board with them all the Provi≈øions they could ama≈øs from the Wreck of the Ship; but they had ≈øcarcely been an Hour at Sea, when the Wind began to blow hard, and the Sea ran ≈øo high, that they were obliged to throw the greate≈øt Part of their Provi≈øions over-board, to avoid im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:007859_0262_102DDC54E22CE2D8"/>De≈øtruction. This was a terrible Mi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune, in a Part of the World where Food is ≈øo hard to be got: However, they ≈øtill per≈øi≈øted in their De≈øign, putting on Shore as often as they could to ≈øeek Sub≈øi≈øtance. But about a Fortnight after, another dreadful Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident befel them, for the Yawl ≈øunk at an Anchor, and one of the Men in her was drown<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and as the Barge was incapable of car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying the whole Company, they were now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to the hard Nece≈ø≈øity of leaving four Marines behind them on that de≈øolate Shore. But they ≈øtill kept on their Cour≈øe to the Northward, ≈øtruggling with their Di≈øa≈øters, and greatly delayed by the Perver≈øene≈øs of the Winds, and the frequent Interruptions which their Search after Food occa≈øioned; Till at la≈øt, about the End of <hi>January,</hi> having made three un≈øucce≈øsful Attempts to double a Head-land, which they ≈øuppo≈øed to be what the <hi>Spaniards</hi> called Cape <hi>Tres Montes,</hi> it was unanimou≈øly re≈øolved to give over this Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, the Difficulties of which appeared in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuperable, and to return again to <hi>Wager I≈øland,</hi> where they got back about the Middle of <hi>February,</hi> quite di≈øheartned and dejected with their reiterated Di≈øappointments, and almo≈øt peri≈øhing with Hunger and Fatigue.</p>

However, on their return they had the good Luck to meet with ≈øeveral Pieces of Beef, which had been wa≈øhed out of the Ship, and were ≈øwimming in the Sea. This was a mo≈øt ≈øea≈øonable relief to them, after the Hard≈øhips they had endured: And to compleat their good Fortune, there came, in a ≈øhort Time, two Canoes of <hi>Indians,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt which was a Native of <hi>Chiloe,</hi> who ≈øpoke a little <hi>Spani≈øh;</hi> and the Surgeon, who was with Captain <hi>Cheap,</hi> under≈øtanding that Language, he made a Bargain with the <hi>Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an,</hi> that if he would carry the Captain and his People to <hi>Chiloe</hi> in the Barge, he ≈øhould have her, and all that belonged to her for his Pains. Accordingly, on the 6th of <hi>March,</hi> the eleven Per≈øons to which the Company was now reduced, embark'd in the Barge on this new Expedition; but after having proceeded for a few Days, the Captain and four of his principal Officers being on Shore, the Six, who together with an <hi>Indian</hi> remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Barge, put off with her to Sea, and did not return.</p>
            <p>By this Means there were left on Shore Captain <hi>Cheap,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> Lieutenant of Marines, the Honourable Mr. <hi>Byron,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Campbel,</hi> Mid≈øhipmen, and Mr. <hi>Elliot,</hi> the Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geon.
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:007859_0264_102DDC590C4BE748"/>One would have thought their Di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tre≈ø≈øes had long before this Time been inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of Augmentation; but they found, on reflection, that their pre≈øent Situation was much more di≈ømaying than any Thing they had yet gone through, being left on a de≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late Coa≈øt, without any Provi≈øion, or the Means of procuring any; for their Arms, Ammunition, and every Conveniency they were Ma≈øters of, except the tattered Habits they had on, were all carried away in the Barge.</p>
            <p>But when they had ≈øufficiently revolved in their own Minds the various Circum≈øtances of this unexpected Calamity, and were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwaded that they had no relief to hope for, they perceived a Canoe at a Di≈øtance, which proved to be that of the <hi>Indian,</hi> who had un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken to carry them to <hi>Chiloe,</hi> he and his Family being then on Board it. He made no Difficulty of coming to them; for it ≈øeems he had left Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> and his People a little before to go a fi≈øhing, and had in the mean Time committed them to the Care of the other <hi>Indian,</hi> whom the Sail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors had carried to Sea in the Barge. But when he found the Barge gone and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion mi≈ø≈øing, he was extreamly concerned,
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:007859_0265_102DDC5B2BFFCB40"/>and could with Difficulty be per≈øwaded that the other <hi>Indian</hi> was not murdered; but, being at la≈øt ≈øatisfied with the Account that was given him, he ≈øtill undertook to carry them to the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Settlements, and (as the <hi>Indians</hi> are well ≈økilled in fi≈øhing and fowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) to procure them Provi≈øions by the Way.</p>
            <p>About the middle of <hi>March</hi> Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> and the Four that were left with him, ≈øet out for <hi>Chiloe,</hi> the <hi>Indian</hi> having procured a Number of Canoes, and gotten many of his Neighbours together for that Purpo≈øe. Soon after they embarked, Mr <hi>Elliot</hi> the Surgeon died, ≈øo that there now remained only Four of the whole Company. At la≈øt, after a very complicated Pa≈ø≈øage by Land and Water, Captain <hi>Cheap,</hi> Mr. <hi>Byron,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Campbel,</hi> arrived in the Beginning of <hi>June</hi> at the I≈øland of <hi>Chiloe,</hi> where they were received by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> with great Humanity; but, on Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of ≈øome Quarrel among the <hi>Indians,</hi> Mr. <hi>Hamilton</hi> did not get there till two Months after. Thus, above a Twelvemonth after the Lo≈øs of the <hi>Wager</hi> ended this fatiguing Peregrination, which by a Variety of Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes dimini≈øhed the Company from Twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to no more than Four, and tho≈øe too brought ≈øo low, that, had their Di≈øtre≈ø≈øes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued

For the Captain him≈øelf was with Difficulty recovered; and the re≈øt were ≈øo reduced by the Severity of the Weather, their Labour, and their Want of all kinds of Nece≈ø≈øaries, that it was wonderful how they ≈øupported them≈øelves ≈øo long. After ≈øome Stay at <hi>Chiloe,</hi> the Captain and the Three who were ≈øent to <hi>Valparai≈øo,</hi> and thence to St. <hi>Jago,</hi> the Capital of <hi>Chili,</hi> where they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued above a Year: But on the Advice of a Cartel being ≈øettled betwixt <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> Captain <hi>Cheap,</hi> Mr. <hi>Byron,</hi> and Mr. <hi>Hamilton,</hi> were permitted to return to <hi>Europe</hi> on board a <hi>French</hi> Ship. The other Mid≈øhipman, Mr. <hi>Campbel,</hi> having changed his religion, whil≈øt at St. <hi>Jago,</hi> cho≈øe to go back to <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi> with <hi>Pizarro</hi> and his Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, with whom he went afterwards to <hi>Spain</hi> on board the <hi>A≈øia;</hi> and there having failed in his Endeavours to procure a Commi≈ø≈øion from the Court of <hi>Spain,</hi> he returned to <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> and attempted to get rein≈øtated in the <hi>Briti≈øh</hi> Navy; and has ≈øince publi≈øhed a Narration of his Adventures, in which he complains of the Inju≈øtice that had been done him, and ≈øtrongly di≈øavows his ever being in

            <p>After Capt. <hi>Cheap</hi>'s Arrival as above re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated, on reading an Adverti≈øement in the News-Paper, I found there was an Order for all the Officers and People of the <hi>Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger</hi> that were in <hi>England</hi> to repair on board Admiral <hi>Steward,</hi> in order to give their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øitions in for a Court-Martial, to be held concerning the Lo≈øs of his Maje≈øty's Ship the <hi>Wager.</hi> I being then in <hi>London,</hi> ≈øent into their Lord≈øhips to acquaint them that on reading the Adverti≈øement, I was going to <hi>Port≈ømouth,</hi> in order to comply with their Directions.

And is a Murderer at la≈øt come Home to be their Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øer? I have carefully peru≈øed the Journal, and can't conceive that they have been guilty of Piracy, Mutiny, not any Thing el≈øe to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve it.

As I was not known to him, on the≈øe Words, I told him, then I was one of the Men that mu≈øt ≈øuffer, for that I was the unfortunate Gunner of the <hi>Wager:</hi> After he was convinced, he told me, I was then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come his Pri≈øoner; he had me to his Hou≈øe, where I was confined until the re≈øt of the Officers were brought up to Town, which, as ≈øoon as they came up, he wrote to their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhips to inform them, that he had us all in Cu≈øtody; but that I had delivered my ≈øelf up to him here in Town; de≈øiring their Lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhips farther Directions concerning us.

After on Board of Admiral <hi>Steward,</hi> we were told we were to be hang'd, nay, not a Letter came from any of our Friends, but there were the≈øe Words mentioned, <hi>you are to be hang'd!</hi> When the Captain came down to <hi>Port≈ømouth,</hi> ≈øome of my Friends waited on him, de≈øiring to know what he had to alledge again≈øt us?

            <p>In the Latter Part of this Sermon, the≈øe Words were apply'd; <q>Men ≈øhould not feed them≈øelves up in vain Notions or Expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of a reprieve or Pardon, for how of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten are Men deceived even at their la≈øt Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?

            </p>
            <p>Hearing this Sermon gave us ≈øome rea≈øon to think, that we were to fall by the Violence of Power, contrary to the Laws of our Country. In the Evening of the ≈øame Day we were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by the Ma≈øter and Gunner of the ≈øaid Ship, that a certain Gentleman had ≈øent Word that we might have the Privilege of Pen, Ink and Paper until the Day of Tryal, which was to be on the <hi>Tue≈øday</hi> following, and that he had made a re≈øolution, that no Man after Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:007859_0271_102DDC65ED79FBA8"/>of Death ≈øhould be indulged with it on any Account.</p>
            <p>All this we imagined was done on purpo≈øe to intimidate us, to retract from the Truth which was publi≈øhed to the World: But our great, good and ju≈øt God ≈øupported and ≈øtrengthened our Faith to bear with the≈øe In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øults from Men. The next Day in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing came on Board the Judge Advocate, in order to take our Depo≈øitions for Trayl. When I was ≈øent for, I was a≈øked for a Depo≈øition concerning the Lo≈øs, of His Maje≈øty's Ship the <hi>Wager;</hi> I made An≈øwer, Sir, I am ≈øurpri≈øed that you ≈øhould offer to a≈øk me for a Depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition whil≈øt a Pri≈øoner. Sir, this is not the fir≈øt, but the ≈øecond Time to your Knowledge, that I have been confined on this very Occa≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; I always thought, or at lea≈øt the Laws of my Country tell me, that when a Man is a Pri≈øoner, he mu≈øt be accu≈øed; and I take my Accu≈øer to be Captain <hi>Cheap,</hi> expecting you was come here on purpo≈øe to have given me his Charge, to prepare my≈øelf for Tryal again≈øt him. The Mar≈øhal's An≈øwer was, <hi>Sir, this Court-Martial is only to know how the Ship was lo≈øt, therefore you mu≈øt give me your Depo≈øition in Regard to it.</hi> I an≈øwered, Sir, that is made mention of in a very particular Manner in the
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:007859_0272_102DDC686954FE60"/>Journal that is publi≈øhed, and by the Truth of which Book I ≈øtand or fall. He made An≈øwer, <hi>Sir, that does not avail, you mu≈øt give it us from under your own Hand Writing,</hi> I reply'd, if I do, Sir, I mu≈øt take it from the Journal; which I did. The next Day came on the Tryal, where Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> alledged the Lo≈øs of the Ship on Lieutenant <hi>Robert Beans</hi> by not ≈øetting the Main-top-≈øail, and letting go the Anchor, according to his Orders. However it was proved by ≈øome of the Offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers there, the Impo≈ø≈øibility of it. After being examined about the Lo≈øs of the Ship, was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd by the Court to withdraw; ≈øome time af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was order'd into Court again, where was read, <hi>We do Honourably acquit Captain</hi> David Cheap, <hi>with the Re≈øt of his Officers, from the Lo≈øs of His Maje≈øty's Ship the</hi> Wager, <hi>excepting Lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant</hi> Robert Beans, <hi>who has di≈øobey'd his Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's Orders, by not ≈øetting the Main-top-≈øail, and letting go the Anchor, as ordered; however, in Regard to his Hard≈øhips and Misfortunes, do al≈øo acquit him with a Reprimand from the Court.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In this Day's Proceedings we beheld the great and glorious Power of the Almighty, in plead-our Cau≈øe, and defending us from falling by the Violence of Men. In about a Week's time after, I went to <hi>London,</hi> and writ unto their

I made An≈øwer, I was; to this he replyed, <q>How dare you pre≈øume to touch a Gentleman's Character in ≈øo publick a Manner as you have done? Do you think that Captain <hi>Cheap</hi> has nothing to ≈øay in Vindication of his Character?

Next Morning we expected they would have ≈øtretch'd in for the Land; but, to our great Surprize, we ≈øaw the Schooner with her En≈øign hoi≈øted at the Topping-lift, and under Sail from us.</p>
            <p>The di≈ømal Apprehen≈øion we were under at ≈øuch an unexpected Stroke, appeared plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in our Countenances, and are much ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øier to be imagin'd than de≈øcribed. We found our≈øelves on a wild de≈øolate Part of th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> World, fatigued, ≈øickly, and de≈øtitute of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øions. 'Tis true we had Arms and Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition, and, whil≈øt that la≈øted, made a toler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Shift for a Livelihood. The neare≈øt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habited Place we knew of was <hi>Buenos-Ayres,</hi> about three hundred Miles to the N. W. but at pre≈øent we were in a very poor Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to undertake ≈øuch an hazardous Journey, being ≈øo mi≈øerably reduced by our tedious Pa≈ø≈øage thro' the <hi>Streights of Magellan.</hi> No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing remained but to commit our≈øelves to
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:007859_0278_102DDC77B3CB9908"/>kind Providence, and make the be≈øt of our melancholy Situation, till we had recruited our≈øelves.</p>
            <p>We were in Number eight who were thus abandoned by our Crew, for who≈øe Pre≈øerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion we ri≈øqued our Lives, in ≈øwimming a≈øhore for Provi≈øions. Our Names were <hi>Guy Broad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>water, Samuel Cooper, Benjamin Smith, John Duck, Jo≈ø. Clinch, John Andrews, John Allen,</hi> and my≈øelf. After deliberating upon our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy Circum≈øtances, and comforting each other with imaginary Hopes, we came to a re≈øolution of taking up our Quarters on the Beach where we landed, till we ≈øhould grow ≈øtrong enough to undergo the Fatigue of a Journey to <hi>Buenos-Ayres.</hi> The Weather being very favourable, we took up our Lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in a Trench near the Sea-≈øide, quite ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed, without any Covering but the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. Here we ≈øtay'd about a Month, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring which Time we lived upon Seal, which were very plenty, and which we knocked down with Stones after we had cut off their retreat, by getting between them and the Sea. Here was likewi≈øe plenty of fre≈øh Water, from a ≈ømall Spring which ro≈øe out of the Trench; ≈øo that, at the Month's End, we had pretty well recover'd our≈øelves, and
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:007859_0279_102DDC798E579D98"/>concluded upon laying in a Stock of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions for our Journey to <hi>Buenos-Ayres.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Having provided our≈øelves each with a Knap≈øack, which we made of Seal-≈økin, in the be≈øt Manner we could, we put into it as much dried Seal as we could carry, and their Bladders we filled with Fre≈øh Water, which ≈øerved us for Bottles. We took our Mu≈økets and Ammunition with us, and, thus accoutred, we ≈øet out on our Journey about the Middle of <hi>February;</hi> and, that we might proceed with the more Certainty, we were determined to keep clo≈øe to the Sea-≈øide till we ≈øhould come to the Mouth of the <hi>River Plate.</hi> The fir≈øt two Days we travelled about ≈øixty Miles, but could meet with no fre≈øh Water, be≈øides what we brought with us, the Country being ≈øcorch'd with Drought, and the rains not yet ≈øet in. Our Water be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing near expended, we were afraid to proceed, le≈øt we ≈øhould peri≈øh for want of more; ≈øo, after a few Debates, we agreed to return back to our old Quarters, and wait till the rainy Sea≈øon. We were two Days and a half on our return, after which we employ'd our≈øelves in building a Sort of Hut under a Cliff adjoining the Sea-≈øide, to ≈øecure us from the Inclemencies of the Weather. Here we tarried three Months, during which Time
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:007859_0280_102DDC7BCF1F9500"/>our Food was Seals and Armadillos, which was the only Provi≈øion to be met with here, except Sea-weed, which we ≈øometimes made u≈øe of with our Meat in≈øtead of Bread. The Seal here differ from tho≈øe which I have ≈øeen in other Parts, both in Size and Make. The Males are the Bigne≈øs of a good Calf; their Neck is ≈øhaggy; their Head and Face is ≈øomewhat like a Lion's. The Females are like Lione≈ø≈øes before, but their Hair is ≈ømooth all over like an Hor≈øe's, whereas the Male is ≈ømooth only on his hinder Parts. From the hinder Part grow two large Fins like Feet, and two more out of the Brea≈øt, by Means of which they can climb rocks and Precipices, tho' they delight chiefly to lie a≈øleep near the Shore. Some are fourteen Feet long, and very fat; but in general they are about eight Feet: The Fle≈øh of the young ones is almo≈øt as white as Lamb, and tolerable good Eating. From the Shoulders to the Tail they grow tapering like Fi≈øh; and when the Females give ≈øuck to their Young they ≈øit upon their Fins, which grow out of their hinder Part. Their Hair is of different Colours, looking very ≈øleek when they come fir≈øt out of the Sea.</p>
            <p>The Armadillo is as big nearly as a ≈ømall Sucking-Pig, the Body of it pretty large.
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:007859_0281_102DDC7DB975B780"/>It is inclo≈øed in a thick Shell, which guards all its Back, and comes down on both Sides, meeting under the Belly, leaving room for the four Legs; the Head is ≈ømall, with a No≈øe like a Hedgehog, and a pretty long Neck, which it thru≈øts out before its Body when it walks, but on any Danger ≈øhe draws it in under the Shell, and, thru≈øting in her Feet, ≈øhe lies ≈øtock-≈øtill like a Land Turtle, and tho' you kick her about ≈øhe will not move her≈øelf. The Shell is jointed in the Middle of the Back, ≈øo that ≈øhe can turn the fore Part of her Body which Way ≈øhe plea≈øes; the Feet are like tho≈øe of a Land Turtle, and it has ≈øtrong Claws, with which it digs Holes in the Ground, and burrows in them like a rabbit. Its Fle≈øh is very good Eating, and ta≈øtes much like a Turtle.</p>
            <p>Nothing remarkable happen'd to us in the≈øe three Months. Our Provi≈øions, ≈øuch as they were, were not very difficult to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, and we were ≈øupplied with Fire-wood enough from a ≈ømall Wood or Coppice a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout ≈øeven Miles from us. We ≈øeldom fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of bringing home ≈øomething every Night, and generally had a hot Supper. We pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øed our Time as chearful as poor Fellows in our Circum≈øtances could. But we knew we could not take up this Place for our ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:007859_0282_102DDC7FADE26DF0"/>Abode; and there was no Likelihood of any Inhabitants near us, nor for many Miles round could we perceive the lea≈øt Traces of any ever having been there; and 'twas to no Purpo≈øe to expect the Sight of any Ve≈ø≈øel off at Sea; for, it being a deep Bay, and ≈øhoal Water, no Ships ever put in there, unle≈øs forced by Stre≈øs of Weather, and then they mu≈øt be wrecked. Nothing remain'd for us but to make a ≈øecond Attempt for the river <hi>Plate;</hi> for, if we ≈øhould march to the Inland Country in que≈øt of Inhabitants, po≈ø≈øibly we ≈øhould meet with in≈øuperable Difficulties in finding the Way back again to what I may call our Home; whereas if we kept our Cour≈øe along the Sea-≈øhore we could not err. For which rea≈øons we re≈øolved upon another Attempt by the ≈øame rout, and, having laid in our Stock of Seal, Armadillos, and fre≈øh Water, towards the latter End of <hi>May,</hi> we ≈øet forward once more.</p>
            <p>In three Days we travelled about ≈øeventy Miles; when towards Night, there came on a violent Storm of rain, Thunder and Light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, which continued the whole Night: We had a plain open Country, and no Place of Shelter could be found; we had nothing to cover us but a Seal-≈økin Jacket, were half dead with Cold, and afraid how our Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øions
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:007859_0283_102DDC81EFDD1510"/>would hold out; for we met with no Supplies of any Kind by the Way. To proceed farther was only lengthening our Journey back again, which we feared, would be the Con≈øequence at la≈øt, even tho' we ≈øhould ≈øtill pu≈øh on. There had been the ≈øtricte≈øt Harmony and Good-nature between us till now; but now we were like to have di≈øagreed even to parting. Some were for pu≈øhing forward, be the Event what it might; and 'twas with Difficulty they were per≈øwaded not to divide. However, upon a repre≈øentation of the great Di≈øtance we were as yet from the Mouth of the river, and the Improbability of meeting with Supplies of Provi≈øion by the Way, our Debates ended, and we jointly concluded on making the be≈øt of our Way back to our Hut, having been a ≈øecond Time di≈øappointed in our At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
            <p>After being arrived at our old Quarters, we began to con≈øult what Mea≈øures to take for our Security from the Inclemencies of the Weather, and to provide for our Sub≈øi≈øtence, till it ≈øhould plea≈øe God, one Way or other, to deliver us out of this Melancholy Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. In order to avoid Di≈øputes about the laborious Part of getting Provi≈øions, we a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to divide our≈øelves into two Parties,
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:007859_0284_102DDC83B61EC838"/>who were, alternately, to provide for the Whole: Four were appointed to ≈øcour the Country one Day, and the other four the next. And we had bound our≈øelves by an Oath never to quit each other, unle≈øs obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by a ≈øuperior Force; for tho' we had as yet ≈øeen no Foot≈øteps of Inhabitants, we could not be certain there were none on this Part of the Globe. We had killed ≈øuch a Number of Seal, that they now became ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ≈øhy of us, and had lived upon them ≈øo long that we were almo≈øt ≈øurfeited; yet there was hardly any thing el≈øe to be met with. We ≈øaw a great Number of wild Dogs, but could never come near enough to kill any; tho' now and then we chanced to ≈øhoot a Puppy, which, as it was change of Diet, we thought delicious Fare. We ≈øaw al≈øo ≈øome Deer, but could contrive no Method to take them. One Day in our rambles, we met with a Litter of young Puppies: they were but three, and ≈øeemed to be about two Months old, and taken Shelter in a Hole of one of the Sand-hills. We took 'em out, and brought 'em home to our Hut. Having di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover'd that the≈øe Puppies were whelped in Holes like tho≈øe of rabbits but larger, we went all out the next Day in que≈øt of more, and had the good Luck to find three Litters, in
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:007859_0285_102DDC86141FAC20"/>Number thirteen, which we carried home with us, de≈øigning if po≈ø≈øible, to bring them up tame. We fed them with Broth made of Seals, and ≈øometimes with the Fle≈øh minced ≈ømall; and they afterwards became very ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viceable to us. Each of us had his Brace of Dogs, which were brought up under as much Command as an <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Spaniel, nor would they leave us to a≈ø≈øociate with the wild Ones; they often ≈øupplied us with Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>madillos, and once they killed us a Deer. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one Day hunting, we ≈øaw ≈øome wild Hogs, with their Young; our Dogs pur≈øued them, and took two of the Young, which we ≈øaved alive; and we ≈øhot one of the old Ones, which afforded us many dainty Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. The young ones proved to be a Boar and a Sow, which was very fortunate, and we de≈øigned to rear them for Breeding, le≈øt we ≈øhould be obliged to a long re≈øidence in this de≈øolate Country. We brought them up very tame, in≈øomuch that they followed our Dogs when ever we went a hunting; and at Night both Dogs and Pigs, took up their Lodging with us in our Hut.</p>
            <p>For the pre≈øent our Condition ≈øeemed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable; nay, we thought our≈øelves in very comfortable Circum≈øtances: We wanted for nothing, and, if we could have confined our
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:007859_0286_102DDC88158DE9F0"/>Thoughts to pre≈øent Enjoyments, our Situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was very agreeable. But our Views were farther, and the Fears of what might happen frequently ≈øtruck a Damp on our Plea≈øures. Winter was now approaching; we had the Inclemencies of the Sea≈øon to guard again≈øt, and if po≈ø≈øible, a Stock of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øions to be laid up again≈øt future Emergen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies. but we could not be much before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand with Provi≈øions, having no Salt to cure them, and at pre≈øent not Sun enough to dry them; for with Winter came on continual Storms, with rains, in≈øomuch that ≈øome Days we could not ≈øtir out of our Hut.</p>
            <p>'Twas now more than ≈øeven Months ≈øince the Long-boat left us. Winter came on very fa≈øt, and we were but badly ≈øecured from the Severity of the Weather. We re≈øolved im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediatety to put our Habitation in Order, and to ≈øecure our Hut in the be≈øt Manner we could. Accordingly it was agreed that ≈øix ≈øhould ≈øtay at home next Day to prepare Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terials, and two only to go out after Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øions, the Lot <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap>e three Armadillos, tho's we travelled many Miles. 'Twas ≈øo dark before we returned, that we de≈øpaired of finding our Hut, and were like to have taken up our
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:007859_0287_102DDC8A617A7EE0"/>Lodging in the open Plain, if our Comrades had not come out in que≈øt of us, and, by making a Fire, directed us towards them. After we had broiled our Game, and fed heartily, about Twelve we went to ≈øleep. But, about Two in the Morning, a violent Storm, with rain, Thunder, and Lightning, threw down Part of the Cliff upon us, under which we had built our Hut, and was very near proving fatal to us all; but, thro' Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, none were hurt. With Day-light came on tolerable Weather; and now the fir≈øt Thing we had to do was to rebuild our Hut. We immediately went to the Coppice where we u≈øed to ≈øeek our Fire-wood, in order to fell ≈øome Poles. As we had but one Hatchet betwixt us, one only could fell them, and the re≈øt of us brought them out and bundled 'em. We had cut ≈øeveral, and were bundling them, when we ≈øaw <hi>Jo≈ø. Clinch</hi> running out of the Wood, and crying, <hi>Lord have Mercy upon us, here's a great Tyger.</hi> We were in the utmo≈øt Con≈øternation; for having been frequently there before, and never once ≈øeeing any Foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øteps of Wild Bea≈øts, we came without our Arms, ≈øu≈øpecting no Danger from that Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. We all took to our Heels, and ≈øoon ≈øaw him running out of the Wood in Pur≈øuit of us. When he was come within twenty
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:007859_0288_102DDC8D2DE367F0"/>Yards of us, finding it impo≈ø≈øible to e≈øcape him, we all turned towards him, clapping our Hands, and making a loud Holo, in order to frighten him, which had the de≈øired Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect; for he immediately ≈øat back on his Tail, gazing at us. What to do we knew not, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther 'twas be≈øt to fly, or wait for his turning; but Fear prevailed, and we walked gently off, without his pur≈øuing us. Next Day we all went with our Mu≈økets in Chace of him, but could not meet with him. We brought home our Poles, and fitted up our Hut in the be≈øt Manner we could, ≈øufficient to guard us from the rain.</p>
            <p>About three Weeks after, when we were hunting on the Plain, about four Miles from home, we ≈øaw a Lion couched on the Ground, watching his Prey, as we imagin'd, it being clo≈øe by a wild Cat's Hole. We joined clo≈øe together in a Body, with our Mu≈økets ready; and <hi>Jo≈ø. Clinch</hi> fired a Ball at him at twenty Yards Di≈øtance, re≈øting his Piece on my Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, but mi≈øs'd him: The Lion took no No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of the report of the Gun, nor ≈øtirred from his Po≈øture. He charged a ≈øecond Time, ours being kept in readine≈øs in Ca≈øe he ≈øhould advance towards us; he fired, and ≈øhot him in the right Shoulder; he fell on his Back, and we ran to him, and knock'd him in the
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:007859_0289_102DDC8F70878DB0"/>Head with the Bones of a dead Hor≈øe which lay near him. We carried him to our Hut, dre≈øs'd his Heart and Part of his ribs; but 'twas very indifferent Eating.</p>
            <p>Finding our≈øelves beginning to be ≈øurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with wild Bea≈øts, and every Day and Night in continual Danger (for we now ≈øeldom went abroad without meeting ≈øome Bea≈øt of Prey; this being, I ≈øuppo≈øe, the Time of Year when they take their Haunts towards the Sea-coa≈øt), we determin'd to make another Pu≈øh for our Deliverance, and try our Fortune once more in an Expedition to <hi>Buenos Ayres.</hi> In order hereto we provided our≈øelves Shoes and Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets of Seal-≈økins, and made our≈øelves Knap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øacks of the ≈øame to carry our Provender. The Weather was ≈øet in fair, and we were fully determin'd to lay in ≈øuch a Stock of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øions as ≈øhould la≈øt us to the End of our Journey, if we ≈øhould be a Month in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming it. To this End we divided our≈øelves into two Parties; four of us were to go to the rocks for Seal, and the other four to hunt on the Plain. Accordingly we ≈øet out early in the Morning: 'twas my Lot, with <hi>Sam. Coop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, John Andrews,</hi> and <hi>John Duck,</hi> to go to the rocks. Our u≈øual Way in killing Seal being with Stones or Clubs, we never carried our Mu≈økets with us, we had been out all Day,
<pb n="268" facs="unknown:007859_0290_102DDC91C8AC8CF0"/>and killed three; and in the Du≈øk of the Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, when we were got within a Stone's Ca≈øt of our Hut, I perceiv'd our Dogs very bu≈øy at a ≈ømall Di≈øtance, wagging their Tails in a very fondling Manner. Being a-head of my Companions, I pa≈ø≈øed on without much regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, thinking they had lighted on a dead Colt. But when I came to the Hut, I was quite confounded: The Hut was rifled, and all our Nece≈ø≈øaries taken away. In the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo≈øt Con≈øternation I ran back to my Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rades, whom I ≈øaw ≈øtanding where I had left the Dogs: Seeing me running eagerly towards them, they cry'd out, <hi>What's the Matter,</hi> I≈øaac? I told them our Hut was pull'd down, and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very thing taken away. <hi>Ay,</hi> ≈øaid they, <hi>and ≈øomething wor≈øe has happened; for yonder lie poor</hi> Guy Broad-water <hi>and</hi> Ben. Smith <hi>murder'd.</hi> 'Twas a mo≈øt ≈øhocking Sight: One had his Throat cut and the other was ≈øtabb'd in the Brea≈øt; they were hardly cold, ≈øo we thought the Murderers could not be far off. And we were under no ≈ømall Apprehen≈øion of ≈øharing a like Fate. We went to the Hut to in≈øpect more narrowly, and found every thing taken away; our Powder, Ball, and Mu≈økets gone, the Fire extingui≈øh'd, and not the lea≈øt Uten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øil left. Where to go or what to do we knew not. We dur≈øt not tru≈øt our≈øelves another
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:007859_0291_102DDC93FA8CC8E8"/>Night on this fatal Spot, and yet were afraid to venture farther. At la≈øt we came to a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolution of going to the next ≈øandy Bay, about a Mile off, and take up our Quarters there for that Night: But, when there, we could find no Shelter, not ≈øo much as a Cliff to lie under; ≈øo were obliged to return to our old Place, and pa≈øs the Night there, happen what would. Next Morning the Dogs which belonged to our Comrades ≈øtood on the Top of the Cliff barking at us, and would not come down, tho' we called them by their Names; and 'twas with Difficulty we enticed them down in the Evening. What became of <hi>Jo≈ø. Clinch</hi> and <hi>John Allen</hi> we knew not, nor could we after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards learn any Account of them: What ≈øeem'd mo≈øt probable to us was, that the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> had carried them off, and murder'd the other two, who po≈ø≈øibly might make ≈øome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtance, as we had all agreed to do, in Ca≈øe we ≈øhould be attack'd; but, if ≈øo, we might probably have expected to have found ≈øome or other of their Enemies killed, as our People had Fire-Arms with them. And it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈ø≈øible it could be the re≈øult of a Quarrel a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong≈øt them≈øelves, from the Manner of their Death; for one was ≈øtabb'd, and the other had his Throat cut, both very plainly done with a Knife, an In≈øtrument which none of
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:007859_0292_102DDC964CD942C8"/>us had the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of. We buried 'em in the the be≈øt Manner we could, by ≈øcraping a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way the light Sand with our Hands two Feet deep, and rai≈øing a Bed of Sand over the Corp≈øes.</p>
            <p>This was the mo≈øt afflicting Stroke of any we received ≈øince our re≈øidence in this unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Country. I won't pretend to de≈øcribe the Horrors we felt; the compa≈ø≈øionate reader will paint our Di≈øtre≈øs in his Imagination in ≈øtronger Colours than can be de≈øcribed by Words. To ≈øee four of our Companions ≈ønatched from us ≈øuddenly we knew not how, our≈øelves deprived of our Arms and Uten≈øils, left without Fire, or any Method of procur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, expecting every Moment to ≈øhare their Fate, or to be ≈øtarved to Death, filled us with un≈øpeakable Terrors.</p>
            <p>In this melancholy State the only thing that remain'd to be done was immediately to quit this unhappy Place, and make one Attempt more for <hi>Buenos Ayres.</hi> We had no Time to lo≈øe, but in≈øtantly ≈øet about tearing up the Seal in ≈ømall Pieces, raw as it was, with which we filled our Knap≈øacks, and their Bladders we filled with Water, le≈øt we ≈øhould find none on our Journey. Having furni≈øh'd our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves with as much Provi≈øion as we could carry, we ≈øet forward on our Journey, with
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:007859_0293_102DC7076EA400A0"/>our ≈øixteen Dogs and two Pigs; praying the Almighty to be our Guide. We kept clo≈øe along the Sea Coa≈øt, as we had done be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, by which Means we could not mi≈øs the <hi>River Plate;</hi> where when we ≈øhould arrive our De≈øign was to travel along the Side of that river till we ≈øhould come to ≈øome inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Place: A Scheme ea≈øy enough in Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination, but in Practice attended, as we found, with in≈øuperable Difficulties.</p>
            <p>The Sea Coa≈øt all along is a plain ≈øandy Beach; on the Land Side are here and there very high Sand-hills: In the Valleys of tho≈øe Hills we repo≈øed our≈øelves at Night. On the Beach we ≈øometimes found ≈øome Cockles, which the Sea had wa≈øh'd in; the≈øe were a great Dainty to us. We met with Part of the Wreck of a large Ship which was drove upon the Beach, particularly a Man of War's Gang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>board, and a Piece of Plank mark'd fifteen Foot. In the Valleys of the Sand-hills was Plenty of Water, which had been ponded up after the rains; and we frequently met with dead Fi≈øh thrown in upon the Beach; ≈øo that we had a Variety of raw Meat to feed upon. We al≈øo found by the Sea-≈øide a very large dead Whale which was a Fea≈øt for our Dogs and Pigs, and at a little Di≈øtance a Parcel of fine Whale-bone.</p>

At the End of ten Days we made the Cape of the river, having travelled very hard every Day, and met with tolerable Weather, but when we got there we found a Multitude of ≈ømall rivers and muddy Swamps to ob≈øtruct us. We ≈øwam over ≈øeveral of them, with our Knap≈øacks acro≈øs our Shoulders; and when Night came on we cover'd our≈øelves with the ru≈øhes, but were almo≈øt devour'd by Mu≈øke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes. Next Day we made ≈øeveral Attempts to proceed farther, but found it impo≈ø≈øible to accompli≈øh our Journey; the farther we went the greater Difficulties we met with. We were ≈øeveral times in Danger of being ≈øuffo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, the Bog often ≈øinking us to the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders; ≈øo that, after many fruitle≈øs Attempts to proceed, we found we had no remedy left but to tread back the melancholy Path, and return to our old Place of rendezvous; which we performed in le≈øs than ten Days.</p>
            <p>At our return we were afraid to ramble far abroad, having neither Arms nor Ammunition to defend our≈øelves from the Wild Bea≈øts. Our two Pigs maintained us near a Fortnight, and afterwards we were obliged to live upon ≈øome of our tru≈øty Dogs; but this raw Way of feeding, which continued three Months long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, brought us into an ill State of Health. About a Quarter of a Mile from our Hut we
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:007859_0295_102DDC9CECADA328"/>found a dead Hor≈øe, of which now and then we took a Mor≈øel, by Way of Change; and could we have got Fire to dre≈øs it, the Vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety would have been agreeable enough. Not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding our Fears, Nece≈ø≈øity compell'd us to go abroad in Search of other kind of Provi≈øions, and ≈øometimes we had the good Fortune to bring home an Armadillo.</p>
            <p>One Morning we found the Trunk of a large Tree, and imagined 'twas not impo≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, with the Help of the Skins of Seal and Hor≈øes, to make a Sort of a Boat with it, which might ≈øerve to convey us along Shore to the river <hi>Plate.</hi> But we had no kind of Tool to u≈øe. <hi>J. Duck</hi> recollected that about eleven Months before, at the End of our fir≈øt Attempt for <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> he threw away his Mu≈øket, it being a very indifferent one, and not worth the trouble of bringing home, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving enough be≈øides for our U≈øe. We pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to go in Search of it, which if we could find might ≈øerve to make a Hatchet, Acoord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly we furni≈øh'd our≈øelves with ≈øome ra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

On our return home we found ≈øeveral O≈øtriches Eggs, about half buried in the Sand, which was a refre≈øhing Meal to us (tho' we never met with any of the Birds.) When we brought it home <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>Two Days after we had fini≈øhed our Hatch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, it being my Turn to ≈øtay in the Hut, my three Comrades went to a Place which we called the <hi>Long Point</hi> in Search of Provi≈øions. Towards Evening I walked out to ≈øee if they were returning; when, to my A≈øtoni≈øhment, I di≈øcover'd about a Dozen of Hor≈øes gallop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down the ≈øandy Bay towards our Hut, and, as they came nearer, I plainly ≈øaw Men on their Backs, and that they were <hi>Indians.</hi> 'Twas in vain to fly; I imagined nothing but Death approaching, and prepared to meet it with all the re≈øolution I could mu≈øter up. I ran towards them, and fell on my Knees, begging my Life with all the Signs of Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility I could make; when I heard a Voice ≈øaying, <hi>Don't be afraid</hi> I≈øaac! <hi>we are all here.</hi> This revived me. The <hi>Indians</hi> alighted, and whil≈øt ≈øome were intent on examining the Hut, others ≈øtood with drawn Knives, ready to di≈øpatch us in ca≈øe we made any re≈øi≈øtance. When they had ≈øatisfied ther Curio≈øity they
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:007859_0297_102DDCA189963558"/>gave three confu≈øed Shouts, and immediately made us get up behind them, and carried us away a few Miles in from the Sea-≈øhore to the S. W. where were about a Dozen more of their Companions, with upwards of four hundred Hor≈øes which they had taken in Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They treated us with great Huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, killed a Hor≈øe for us, kindled a Fire, and roa≈øted a Part of it, which to us, who had been three Months eating raw Fle≈øh, was a mo≈øt delicious Entertainment. They al≈øo gave each of us a Piece of an old Blanket to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver our Nakedne≈øs. I was in great Danger, it ≈øeems, of being left alone; for when the <hi>Indians</hi> met with my three Comrades, they were immediately for hurrying them away to their Place of rendezvous, till, with Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they were brought to under≈øtand, by Signs, that there was one more belonging to them a little Way off; and then guided them to the Hut, where I had the Happine≈øs of being ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken Pri≈øoner with them.</p>
            <p>Next Morning we decamped from this Place, driving our Troop of Hor≈øe before us. We travelled nineteen Days before we arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved at their next Place of rendezvous, which. I imagine, was about two hundred Miles from our Hut to the S. W. in a Valley be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two very high Mountains, where was
<pb n="276" facs="unknown:007859_0298_102DDCA3268CCA28"/>fine Pa≈øture for their Hor≈øes, and ≈øeveral ≈ømall rivers of fre≈øh Water, but very little Wood to be ≈øeen for many Miles round. In this Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley were about a Dozen <hi>Indian</hi> Huts, built with Poles and the Skins of Hor≈øes, inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by another Party of <hi>Indians,</hi> with their Wives and Children, who gazed very earne≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on us, as tho' they had never ≈øeen any White People before. Here we were bought and ≈øold four different Times for a Pair of Spurs, a Bra≈øs Pan, O≈øtriches Feathers, and ≈øuch like Trifles, which was the low Price generally ≈øet on each of us; and ≈øometimes we were played away at Dice; ≈øo that we chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Ma≈øters ≈øeveral Times in a Day. In this Place we remained near a Month, by which Time the ≈øeveral Parties of <hi>Indians</hi> had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from their Hunting, and joined us, each Party bringing the Hor≈øes they had ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in hunting, and mixing them all in the common Stock; which were examin'd and told over by one of the <hi>Indians</hi> who ≈øeemed to be a ≈øort of a Captain over the re≈øt, and they amounted to the Number of fifteen Hundred and upwards, ≈øome of which were no way inferior to the be≈øt of our <hi>European</hi> Breed.</p>
            <p>After one Day's grand Fea≈øting, we ≈øet out in a Body for their Chief Town, where the
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:007859_0299_102DDCA5D94E6C90"/>King, or Captain, lived, with fifteen hundred String of Hor≈øes in our Cavalcade. We were four Months in performing our Jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, and, by the Method of our traveling, I believe it mu≈øt be a thou≈øand Miles from the Sea-Coa≈øt where our Hut ≈øtood. In the Day-time we travelled, and at Night repo≈øed our≈øelves in their moveable Huts, which ≈øhelter'd us from the Weather. Our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant Food was Hor≈øe-fle≈øh, which ≈øome cho≈øe to eat raw, and others broiled or roa≈øted; and, as for Drink, we never fail'd of Water; for I found they were well acquainted with every ≈ømall rivulet, of which there are Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers in the rout they took, tho' a Stranger would hardly have found them.</p>
            <p>At length we arrived to the End of our Journey, the Chief Town, where the King lives; but our Ma≈øters who had made the la≈øt Purcha≈øe of us were carrying us with them to their own Home (which we learnt after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards was about two hundred Miles beyond the Town where the King re≈øided) and had carried us ≈øome Miles; when a Party of Hor≈øe came after us, and brought us back to the Capital, the King claiming us as his Proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. This Town con≈øi≈øts of about 30 Huts, built, in a low irregular Manner, with Poles and Hor≈øes Skins, ≈øurrounded with Pali≈øadoes,
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:007859_0300_102DE9254F597D38"/>about three Foot Di≈øtance from each other. The Inhabitants, Men, Women, and Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, were about four≈øcore. We were ≈øoon ≈øummoned to appear before his Maje≈øty, who received us in his Hut, ≈øitting on the Ground, with a Javelin on one Side of him, and a Bow and Arrows on the other, a loo≈øe Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle round his Wai≈øt, and a ≈øort of Turret of O≈øtriches Feathers on his Head, and a long reed Pipe in his Mouth, ≈ømoaking. After paying our Obedience to him, he began to a≈øk us ≈øeveral Que≈øtions in <hi>Spani≈øh,</hi> of which they all can ≈øpeak a little, which we ≈øoon let him know we under≈øtood a little of; en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired what Countrymen we were, and how we came to this Country. We told him we were <hi>Engli≈øhmen,</hi> lo≈øt in the <hi>South-Sea,</hi> in an <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Man of War, as we were going to fight again≈øt our Enemies the <hi>Spaniards;</hi> that we were eight in Number who were left on a de≈øolate Part of the Continent; that one Evening, on our return from getting Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion, we found two of our Companions mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, and two more carried off, on the Spot of Ground where we were taken, our Hut pull'd down, and every thing taken from us; which we ≈øuppo≈øed mu≈øt be done by ≈øome of his Countrymen. He then called three or four of his Men, and talked very
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:007859_0301_102DC71041874410"/>earne≈øtly to them in their own Language. But it ≈øeems they knew nothing of the Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, as he told us; tho' he was plea≈øed to a≈ø≈øure us ≈øtrict Enquiry ≈øhould be made of the other Parties which were out at the ≈øame Time. For I found by him, that he ≈øends out ≈øeveral different Parties every Spring from every different Town under his Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, who take different routs, and ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times join one another accidentally on their return. But of this more hereafter. When he found we were at War with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> he expre≈øs'd a great deal of Joy, and a≈øk'd if we were Great Men in our Country. We told him yes. He ≈øaid the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were great Enemies to them, had took away their Country from them, and drove them to the Mountains. When he had done examining us, he ordered a Hor≈øe to be killed immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately and dre≈øs'd for us; and lodged us in his own Hut for that Night, till we had one built for us, which was the next Day. Here we ≈øtaid eight Months, and winter'd, during which Time we had frequently Snow five or ≈øix Feet deep. Our Work was chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to fetch Wood and Water, and ≈økin all the Hor≈øes which they killed; and tho' we were their Slaves, we were treated very humanely, and they would ≈øuffer no one to u≈øe us ill.
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:007859_0302_102DDCA7F6EAF1D8"/>There were four <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Women in the Town, whom they had taken captive in a Skirmi≈øh near <hi>Buenos-Ayres;</hi> and the King told us, with a Smile, he would give us each a Wife.</p>
            <p>The Country where the≈øe <hi>Indians</hi> re≈øided, as indeed the whole Coa≈øt of <hi>Patagonia,</hi> is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry fruitful in Pa≈øture, and abounds with great Plenty of wild Hor≈øes, and a few black Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, which are entirely neglected by the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians;</hi> Hor≈øe-fle≈øh being preferr'd by them for eating, before any other Kind of Fle≈øh, and what they con≈øtantly feed upon. 'Tis ≈øituated in a very healthy Climate, and, if the Soil was cultivated, would certainly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Plenty of all Kind of Crain. They have likewi≈øe Plenty of Wood, tho' few or no Timber Trees, ≈øeveral large Coppices grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all round the Country, tho' near the Sea-≈øide we ≈øee nothing but a plain open ≈øand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Coa≈øt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Patagonian Indians,</hi> at lea≈øt tho≈øe in that Part of the Country where we re≈øided, were tall and well-made, being in general, from five to ≈øix Feet high, good-natur'd and obliging to one another, and never ≈øee each other Want. Tho' they have what they call a King, yet he ≈øeems to be only a Chief or Captain of a Party; for, as they have no ≈øet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led Abode, but live ≈øcattered throughout that
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:007859_0303_102DDCAA976CEED8"/>Part of the World in little Towns or Parties, each Party ≈øeems to have a Chief, who pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fides over them like a Petty King. I never could ob≈øerve any rules of Government a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong 'em; but in a Drinking-bout King and Subjects are all alike. Their King is di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh'd from the re≈øt by his being the big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ge≈øt Man, and by wearing a kind of Sa≈øh round his Wai≈øt. 'Tis true he has a Defe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence paid him by his Subjects, and whatever he orders to be done is immediately per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, being him≈øelf exempted from any kind of Work; but I never ≈øaw any Puni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inflicted by him, nor any Quarrels a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them≈øelves, except when they get at a Drinking-Fea≈øt, and then their Wives always took Care no ill Con≈øequence ≈øhould follow, by putting every Weapon out of their Way, and e≈øpecially taking Care of their Knives. For which rea≈øon I imagine that in Liquor they are always quarrel≈øome. One or two In≈øtances of that Kind happen'd whil≈øt we were among them. Their Method of Fea≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this: They have in the Summer a Plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of ≈ømall ≈øweet Berries growing like our Whortle Berries, and when they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured a ≈øufficient Quantity of them, they dig a Pit in the Ground, about four Feet ≈øquare, the Bottom and Sides of which they line
<pb n="282" facs="unknown:007859_0304_102DDCAC399420A8"/>with Hor≈øe Hides. This Ca≈øk (if I may ≈øo call it) they half fill with the≈øe Berries, and then fill it up with Water, which they ≈øtir well with Sticks, and afterwards leave it to ferment about forty eight Hours. They all ≈øit round, ≈ømoaking and drinking, for a whole Night together, Women as well as Men, ≈øing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in their Way, but more like ≈øhrieking Cries; and when drunk frequently proceed to Blows.</p>
            <p>They ≈øeldom live long in one Place; for when their Hor≈øes have eat up the Pa≈øture in one Place, they remove their Town and all their Goods, which is ≈øoon done, a few Miles from the Former; and this ≈øeveral Times in the Year; ≈øo that they have no ≈øettled Place of Abode. They have ≈øcatter'd Habitations all over the Country, and but few Huts together: The Town where their Chief re≈øides has three times the Number of Dwellings to any of the re≈øt which I ≈øaw.</p>
            <p>They ≈øeem to have ≈øome Notion of a Deity, and pay a ≈øort of Wor≈øhip to the Sun and Moon; e≈øpecially at every New Moon, they collect them≈øelves in a Body, and make a ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Proce≈ø≈øion round the Town, one going before with a kind of Hoop in his Hand, round which are tied little Bra≈øs Bells a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dorn'd with O≈øtriches Feathers, which he
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:007859_0305_102DE8FBD8806660"/>would frequently ≈øwing round in his Hand; and then the whole Company would make a mo≈øt hideous Noi≈øe, which, I ≈øuppo≈øe, they de≈øigned for Singing. This Ceremony u≈øual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly la≈øted about half an Hour. This Method with their Hoop and Bells is likewi≈øe u≈øed when any of them are ≈øick or dying. A white Flannel Cloth is hung up before the ≈øick Per≈øon, and the Man with his Hoops and Bells, who is generally one of his relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, comes to vi≈øit him; and after a few Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nutes Conver≈øation, he leaves him, and walks ≈øeveral times round the Hut, jingling his Bells, and talking aloud in a variety of Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents which we could under≈øtand nothing of, but imagined he de≈øigned it for Prayers for his ≈øick Friend. When any of 'em dies, they ≈øoon bury him, generally the next Morning. They roll the Dead Body in a Hide, with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Thing that belongs to him, as Bows, Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and carry it, without any Ceremony, at ≈øome Di≈øtance from the Town; where they throw it into a large round Pit, dug on pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, which they afterwards fill up with Earth. Yet notwith≈øtandind they have no Ceremony at their Funeral, their Mourning for the Dead is very ≈øtrict, which the Friends of the Decea≈øed ob≈øerve for three Months; during which Time they remove them≈øelves
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:007859_0306_102DE8FE65A106B0"/>at a Di≈øtance from any of the re≈øt of the Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, and conver≈øe with nobody; but are ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with Provi≈øions from the whole Town, by the King's Order, 'till the Time of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is over. They ≈øeem to have ≈øome Notion of the Devil, at lea≈øt are afraid of Apparitions; for none of 'em will ≈øtir out of his Hut, when dark, without Company. And one Night in particular we heard a great Noi≈øe in the Town, like ≈øeveral Drums beating, which, the next Day, we found to be ≈øome of the <hi>Indians</hi> beating the Sides of their Hou≈øes, which were made of Hor≈øe-Skins, with large Sticks, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to frighten away the Devil.</p>
            <p>Each <hi>Indian</hi> has but one Wife, and they live together in a very loving Manner. When any of 'em lye-in, there's a Provi≈øion made for them different from what they are acco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modated with at another Time; for the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance of the Hut, which at other Times is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways open, is ≈øhut up with Hor≈øes-Skins as ≈øoon as the Woman begins to be in Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail; and no one goes in till ≈øhe comes out with the Child in her Arms, which is pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øently wrapt up in a Sheep's Skin, and, in≈øtead of a Bed or Cradle, is lain an a Machine ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what like our Hand-barrow, the Bottom of which is likewi≈øe covered with a Sheep's Skin. This is hung up by the four Corners,
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:007859_0307_102DE900C6CF58E0"/>and the Child ≈øwings forwards and back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, in≈øtead of being rock'd in a Cradle, its Arms and Legs being fa≈øten'd to this En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gine by a La≈øh of Hor≈øe-≈økin, to prevent its falling over. By this Method of Treatment, when Children, the back Part of all the <hi>Indians</hi> Heads are very flat; for they never lay them but on their Backs. Perhaps it may be ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to this likewi≈øe that there is not a crooked Per≈øon among≈øt them. In two or three Hours after they have lain-in they go about their u≈øual Work. Every Morning they take all their Children, young and old, and carry them to the next Brook or rivulet adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and plunge them naked under Water, even when the ground is covered with Snow; by which Means they are harden'd to run a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout naked, even in the Mid≈øt of Winter. The Men wear Beads and little Bells round their Neck, Wri≈øt, and ≈ømall of their Legs; and the Women adorn their long Hair with the ≈øame. For ≈øuch Trifles as the≈øe, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with Knives, Bra≈øs Pans, and ≈øuch like, they traffick their Hides with the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> when at Peace with them.</p>
            <p>And now their Time for making the Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Voyage approaching, which they conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually do every Spring, and generally ≈øpend a whole Summer in taking their wild Hor≈øes,
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:007859_0308_102DE903EB9C0830"/>we made great Interce≈ø≈øion to go with them; but were given to under≈øtand, that we mu≈øt be ≈øent farther into the Country, to remain with other <hi>Indians</hi> till their return. But at la≈øt we prevailed, by a≈ø≈øuring the Chief that the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> had Friends at <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> who would make him very hand≈øome Satisfaction for us, and would redeem us at any Price he ≈øhould put upon us. This ≈øeemed to plea≈øe him, and he then con≈øented. We were at pre≈øent about 1000 Miles from <hi>Buenos Ayres;</hi> and their rout extends to the Ea≈øtern Coa≈øt of <hi>Patagonia,</hi> home to the Sea, about an hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Miles to the Southward of <hi>Buenos Ayres.</hi> When they ≈øet out, they carry with them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Thing belonging to them, Women, Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, Hou≈øes, and all. The≈øe la≈øt are ≈ølung acro≈øs the Hor≈øes, and at Night taken down for ≈øheltering them≈øelves from the Weather. They take with them a few Hor≈øes more than they ride, which ≈øerve for maintaining them till their Hunting begins, which ≈øel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom happens till they have travelled ≈øeven or eight Days.</p>
            <p>And now the wi≈øh'd for Time was come, when we all ≈øet out in a Body, except <hi>John Duck,</hi> who≈øe Misfortune it was to be too near of a Complexion with tho≈øe <hi>Indians</hi> (for he was a <hi>Molat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="287" facs="unknown:007859_0309_102DE9059364F358"/>rea≈øon he was ≈øold by the Chief to a Ma≈øter farther up in the Country; where, I believe, he will end his Days, there being no Pro≈øpect of his ever returning to <hi>England.</hi> We had travell'd ten or twelve Days before we had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny wild Hor≈øes; but ≈øoon after ≈øeveral Strag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glers ≈øell Victims to their Ingenuity. Their Method of taking them is really a≈øtoni≈øhing, and worthy of a very particular De≈øcription. As they are excellent Hor≈øemen, and their Hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes as fleet as the wild Ones, 'tis very ≈øeldom they mi≈øs, tho' now and then an Accident of that Kind happens; but the rider is look'd upon with Contempt. They have two different Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods of taking them, each of which I have ≈øeen them perform with incredible Dexteri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The fir≈øt is with a La≈øh of Hor≈øe Skins, about two Inches Broad, and fifty Feet long, with a running Noo≈øe at one End of it. This Noo≈øe they hold in their right Hand, and the other End in the Left, till they come within a few Yards of the Bea≈øt, when they throw the Noo≈øe over his Head, even on full Speed, and hold the other End fa≈øt in their Left Hand. The Bea≈øt is ≈øoon ≈øtopt and taken. The other Method is with a narrow Strap of Hor≈øe-≈økin, about twelve Feet long, to each End of which is fa≈øtened a round Ball of Iron, about two Pounds Weight. When within
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:007859_0310_102DE9087757A9E0"/>Di≈øtance of their Game, they hurl one of the Balls ≈øeveral Times round their Head, till they have got the proper Swing, and then throw it at the Hor≈øe's Legs, parting with the Ball in their Left Hand at the ≈øame Time; which ≈øeldom fails of entangling their Legs, and throwing them to the Ground. The Hor≈øes thus taken are ≈øecured by ≈øome of the Company, who≈øe Bu≈øine≈øs is chiefly to tie the≈øe Hor≈øes together in a String, and guard them. In a few Days they become very tame. They are likewi≈øe very dextrous in killing Birds with the≈øe Balls, and will throw them to a prodigious Height in the Air. This is what they are trained up to from their Infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, and are very expert at, even in their Youth. The≈øe Iron Balls, fa≈øten'd in the above Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, are likewi≈øe their chief warlike Wea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pons, next to their Bows and Arrows.</p>
            <p>Being now arrived within an hundred Miles of <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> we begged of him to di≈øpatch one of his Men to the Governor, to acquaint him of three <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Pri≈øoners he had with him at ≈øuch a Di≈øtance, and to a≈øk if he would redeem us; which he did. And the Me≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, on his return, brought him a certain Pledge for fulfilling his Promi≈øe, which was a Gold-laced Wai≈øtcoat. Next Day we were told to get our≈øelves ready to go to <hi>Buenos
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:007859_0311_102DE90B0E7ED890"/>Ayres,</hi> and that he and ≈øome of his Men would go with us.</p>
            <p>The Hopes of once more ≈øeeing our Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low Chri≈øtians filled us with Joy. We were brought immediately before the Governor, who ≈øatisfy'd our <hi>Indian</hi> Prince, and paid him his ran≈øom, which was ninety Dollars, and a few Trifles, and then di≈ømi≈øs'd him. We return'd him our hearty Thanks for his Kindne≈øs towards us during our abode with him; in which Time we were treated with greater Humanity, than we afterwards met with in our long Confinement on board the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Admiral <hi>Pizarro.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>After we had pa≈øs'd Examination by the Governor, and had given him a full Account of our pa≈øt Misfortunes, we were for a ≈øhort Time di≈ømi≈øs'd upon Parole. And here I ≈øhould be very ungrateful if I did not do Ju≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the Pre≈øident of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> A≈ø≈øiento Hou≈øe, Mr. <hi>Grey,</hi> by acknowledging that 'twas entirely owing to his Compa≈ø≈øion and kind In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terce≈ø≈øion with the Governor, that we were thus redeemed from the Hands of the <hi>Indians,</hi> he offering to do it at his own Charge. We were ≈øent for ≈øeveral Times before the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor, and earne≈øtly pre≈øt to turn Catholicks, and ≈øerve the King of <hi>Spain;</hi> but our An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer was, we were Prote≈øtants, and true <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gli≈øhmen,</hi>

Many tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Offers were made to ≈øeduce us; but, thank God, we re≈øi≈øted them all. When he found all his Efforts were of no Effect, we were ≈øent as Pri≈øoners of War on board the <hi>A≈øia,</hi> which lay then at <hi>Monte Vedio,</hi> about thirty Leagues down the river, waiting for Orders, and had lain there upwards of two Years. This was the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Admiral <hi>Pizarro</hi>'s Ship, which, after an un≈øucce≈øsful Attempt to pa≈øs <hi>Cape Horn,</hi> in order to be in the <hi>South Seas</hi> with his Squadron before ours, was, by tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pe≈øtuous Weather, drove back, and obliged to put into the river <hi>Plate,</hi> having lo≈øt near half her Crew; the Admiral having quitted her, and gone over Land to <hi>Chili.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We were confin'd on board the <hi>A≈øia</hi> above a Year, with 16 other <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Pri≈øoners, in which Time we were treated more like Slaves than Pri≈øoners of War. Our Bu≈øine≈øs was to do all their na≈øty Work; to ≈øwa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In ≈øhort, our U≈øage was ≈øo bad that we agreed with the re≈øt of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Pri≈øoners to attempt our Liberty, tho' at the ri≈øque of our Lives. Accordingly one
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:007859_0313_102DE90F6A3B0CE8"/>Night we e≈øcaped from our Guard, intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ≈øwim a≈øhore, and travel to a <hi>Portu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gue≈øe</hi> Settlement on the North Side of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the Ship lying within a Quarter of a Mile of the Shore. My≈øelf and one more got ≈øafe to Land; the others were di≈øcovered before they got into Water. I was quite naked; the other had a Shirt wrapped round his Head. Before we got halfway to the Shore, a Gun was fir'd from the Ship to alarm the Town. We travelled till Two in the Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and then lay down among the ru≈øhes. The Weather being very fro≈øty, our Feet ≈øwell'd and full of Thorns, we could travel no farther. Soon after Day-light we met with ≈øome Men on Hor≈øeback, belonging to the Plantations, to whom we ≈øurrendered our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves; and they took us behind them to their Hou≈øe. The next Day we were carried from thence by ≈øome Soldiers, who were ≈øent in Pur≈øuit of us, and were carried on board the Ship; where we were put in the Stocks, Neck and Heels, Four Hours every Day for a Fortnight.</p>
            <p>At length we were inform'd of the Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's Arrival at <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> who ≈øoon after came on board, and gave Orders for refitting the Ship in the be≈øt Manner they could, being determin'd to carry her to <hi>Old Spain.</hi> But
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:007859_0314_102DE9126375E950"/>there was a geat Deficiency of Hands, for which rea≈øon Orders were given to impre≈øs what Men they could at <hi>Monte Vedio.</hi> The≈øe, with the 11 <hi>Indians</hi> whom they had four Months before taken Pri≈øoners in a Skirmi≈øh at a Di≈øtance from <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> whom they de≈øign'd for their Row Gallies, were ≈øent on board; and ≈øoon after I had the Plea≈øure of ≈øeeing my Brother Mid≈øhipman Mr <hi>Campbell,</hi> who was lo≈øt in the <hi>Wager</hi> with us, but chu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øing to follow the Fortune of Capt. <hi>Cheap,</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived with him at <hi>Chili.</hi> He came by Land from <hi>Chili</hi> with ≈øome Officers belonging to the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Admiral, and arrived in <hi>March</hi> at <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enos Ayres.</hi> The latter End of <hi>October</hi> fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, 1745, we ≈øet ≈øail from <hi>Monte Vedio</hi> in the <hi>A≈øia</hi> bound for <hi>Spain.</hi>

            <p>Three Days after we ≈øailed, an Affair hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened on board, which was like to have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved fatal to the whole Crew; for about Nine at Night, we were alarmed with the Cry of a Mutiny; and ≈øo indeed it proved: But ≈øuch a one as would never have been ≈øu≈øpected by any of the Ship's Crew, or per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps credited by Po≈øterity, if ≈øuch a Number of Per≈øons were not ≈øtill living to atte≈øt the Fact.

               <hi>Walters,</hi> a≈ø≈øuring the reader that I was a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs to the whole Affair.</p>
            <p>"<hi>Pizarro</hi> had not yet compleated the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of his Adventures; for when he and <hi>Mendinuetta</hi> came back by Land from <hi>Chili</hi> to <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> in the Year 1745, they found at <hi>Monte Vedio</hi> the <hi>A≈øia,</hi> which near three Years before they had left there. This Ship they re≈øolved, if po≈ø≈øible, to carry to <hi>Europe;</hi> and with this View they refitted her in the be≈øt manner they could. But their great Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty was to procure a ≈øufficient Number of Hands to navigate her; for all the remaining Sailors of the Squadron to be met with in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Buenos Ayres,</hi> did not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount to an hundred Men. They endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ≈øupply this Defect by pre≈ø≈øing and put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on board many of the Inhabitants of <hi>Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enos Ayres,</hi> be≈øides all the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Pri≈øoners then in their Cu≈øtody, together with a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>Portugue≈øe</hi> Smugglers, whom they had taken at different Times, and ≈øome of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> of the Country. Among the≈øe la≈øt was a Chief and ten of his Followers, who had been ≈øurprized by a Party of <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Soldiers about three Months before. The Name of this Chief was <hi>Orellana.</hi> He belonged to a very powerful Tribe which had committed great ravages in the Neighbourhood of <hi>Buenos Ayres.</hi>
               <pb n="294" facs="unknown:007859_0316_102DE91619095CE0"/>With this motley Crew (all of them, except the <hi>European Spaniards,</hi> extremely aver≈øe to the Voyage) <hi>Pizarro</hi> ≈øet ≈øail from <hi>Monte Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dio,</hi> in the <hi>River</hi> of <hi>Plate,</hi> about the beginning of <hi>November,</hi> 1745. And the native <hi>Spaniards,</hi> being no Strangers to the Di≈ø≈øatisfaction of their forced Men, treated both the≈øe, the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> Pri≈øoners, and the <hi>Indians,</hi> with great In≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and Barbarity; but more particularly the <hi>Indians:</hi> For it was common for the meane≈øt Officers in the Ship to beat them mo≈øt cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, on the ≈ølighte≈øt Pretences, and oftentimes only to exert their Superiority. <hi>Orellana</hi> and his Followers, tho' in Appearance ≈øufficiently patient and ≈øubmi≈ø≈øive, meditated a ≈øevere re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venge for all the≈øe Inhumanities. As he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øed very well in <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> (the≈øe <hi>Indians</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving in Times of Peace, a good Intercour≈øe with <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi>) he affected to talk with ≈øuch of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> as under≈øtood that Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and ≈øeemed very de≈øirous of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed how many <hi>Engli≈øhmen</hi> there were on board, and which they were. As he knew that the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> were as much Enemies to the <hi>Spaniards</hi> as him≈øelf, he had doubtle≈øs an Intention of di≈øclo≈øing his Purpo≈øe to them, and making them Partners in the Scheme he had projected for revenging his Wrongs and recovering his Liberty. But having ≈øounded
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:007859_0317_102DE919ED1E9920"/>them at a Di≈øtance, and not finding them ≈øo precipitate and vindictive as he expected, he proceeded no further with them; but re≈øolved to tru≈øt alone to the re≈øolution of his ten faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Followers. The≈øe, it ≈øhould ≈øeem, readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly engaged to ob≈øerve his Directions, and to execute whatever Commands he gave them. And, having agreed on the Mea≈øures nece≈ø≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry to be taken, they fir≈øt furni≈øhed them≈øelves with <hi>Dutch</hi> Knives, ≈øharp at the Point, which being the common Knives u≈øed in the Ship, they found no Difficulty in procuring. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øides this, they employed their Lei≈øure in ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretly cutting out Thongs from raw Hides, of which there were great Numbers on board, and in fiting to each End of the≈øe Thongs the double headed Shot of the ≈ømall Quarter-Deck Guns. This, when ≈øwung round their Heads, according to the Practice of their Country, was a mo≈øt mi≈øchievous Weapon, in the U≈øe of which the <hi>Indians</hi> about <hi>Buenos Ayres</hi> are train'd from their Infancy, and con≈øequently are extremely expert. The≈øe Particulars be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in good Forwardne≈øs, the Execution of their Scheme was perhaps precipitated by a particular Outrage committed on <hi>Orellana</hi> him≈øelf. For one of the Officers, who was a very brutal Fellow, ordered <hi>Orellana</hi> aloft, which being what he was incapable of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming,
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:007859_0318_102DE91B9673D938"/>the Officer, under Pretence of his Di≈øobedience, beat him with ≈øuch Violence that he left him bleeding on the Deck, and ≈øtupified for ≈øome Time with his Brui≈øes and Wounds. This U≈øage undoubtedly heighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Thir≈øt for revenge, and made him eager and impatient till the Means of executing it were in his Power; ≈øo that, within a Day or two after this Incident, he and his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers opened their de≈øperate re≈øolves in the en≈øuing Manner.</p>
            <p>"It was about Nine in the Evening, when many of the principal Officers were on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he Quarter-Deck, indulging in the Fre≈øhne≈øs of the Night Air; the Wai≈øt of the Ship was filled with live Cattle; and the Foreca≈øtle was manned with its cu≈øtomary Watch. <hi>Orellana</hi> and his Companions under Cover of the Night, having prepared their Weapons, and thrown off their Trow≈øers and the more cum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berous Part of their Dre≈øs, came altogether on the Quarter-Deck, and drew towards the Door of the Great Cabbin. The Boat≈øwain immediately reprimanded them, and order'd them to be gone. On this <hi>Orellana</hi> ≈øpoke to his Followers in his Native Language; when four of them drew off, two towards each Gang-way, and the Chief and the ≈øix remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Indians</hi> ≈øeemed to be ≈ølowly quitting the
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:007859_0319_102DE91D41643768"/>Quarter Deck. When the detached <hi>Indians</hi> had taken Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Gang-way, <hi>Orella<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na</hi> placed his Hands hollow to his Mouth, and bellowed out the War-Cry u≈øed by the≈øe Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, which is the har≈øhe≈øt and mo≈øt terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying Sound known in Nature. This hideous Yell was the Signal for beginning the Ma≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øacre: For on this they all drew their Knives, and brandi≈øh'd their prepared double Head<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Shot; and the ≈øix, with their Chief, which remained on the Quarter-Deck, immediately fell on the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> who were intermingled with them, and laid near forty of them at their Feet; of which about twenty were kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the Spot, and the re≈øt di≈øabled. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Officers in the Beginning of the Tumult, pu≈øhed into the great Cabin; where they put out the Lights, and barricadoed the Door; and of the others, who had avoided the fir≈øt Fury of the <hi>Indians,</hi> ≈øome endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to e≈øcape along the Gangways into the Foreca≈øtle; but the <hi>Indians,</hi> placed there on Purpo≈øe, ≈øtabbed the greate≈øt Part of them as they attempted to pa≈øs by, or forced them off the Gangways into the Wai≈øt: Others threw them≈øelves voluntarily over the Barrica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>does into the Wai≈øt, and thought them≈øelves happy to lie concealed among the Cattle: But the greate≈øt Part e≈øcaped up the Main Shrowds,
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:007859_0320_102DE9202D6DF970"/>and ≈øheltered them≈øelves either in the Tops or rigging. And tho' the <hi>Indians</hi> attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only the Quarter-Deck, yet the Watch in the Foreca≈øtle, finding the Communication cut off, and being terrified by the Wounds of the few who, not being killed on the Spot, had Strength ≈øufficient to force their Pa≈ø≈øage along the Gangways, and not knowing either who their Enemies were, or what were their Numbers, they likewi≈øe gave all over for lo≈øt, and, in great Confu≈øion, ran up into the rig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging of the Forema≈øt and Bow≈øprit.</p>
            <p>"Thus, the≈øe eleven <hi>Indians,</hi> with a re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution perhaps without Example, po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed them≈øelves, almo≈øt in an In≈øtant, of the Quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-Deck of a Ship mounting ≈øixty ≈øix Guns, with a Crew of near five hundred Men, and continued in peaceable Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of this Po≈øt a con≈øiderable Time: For the Officers in the Great Cabin (among whom were <hi>Pizarro</hi> and <hi>Mindinuetta</hi>) the Crew between Decks, and tho≈øe who had e≈øcaped into the Tops and rigging, were only anxious for their own Safe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and were for a long Time incapable of forming any Project for ≈øuppre≈ø≈øing the In≈øur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and recovering the Po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øion of the Ship. It is true, the Yells of the <hi>Indians,</hi> the Groans of the Wounded, and the confu≈øed Clamours of the Crew, all heighten'd by the
<pb n="299" facs="unknown:007859_0321_102DE922CBE55D48"/>Ob≈øcurity of the Night, had at fir≈øt greatly magnify'd their Danger, and had filled them with the imaginary Terrors which Darkne≈øs, Di≈øorder, and an Ignorance of the real Strength of an Enemy, never fail to produce. For as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> were ≈øen≈øible of the Di≈øaffection of their pre≈øt Hands, and were al≈øo con≈øcious of their Barbarity to their Pri≈øoners, they ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined the Con≈øpiracy was general, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øider'd their own De≈øtruction as infallible; ≈øo that, it is ≈øaid, ≈øome of them had once ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken the re≈øolution of leaping into the Sea, but were prevented by their Companions.</p>
            <p>"However, when the <hi>Indians</hi> had entirely clear'd the Quarter-Deck, the Tumult in a great mea≈øure ≈øub≈øided; for tho≈øe who had e≈øcaped were kept ≈øilent by their Fears, and the <hi>Indians</hi> were incapable of pur≈øuing them, to renew the Di≈øorder. <hi>Orellana,</hi> when he ≈øaw him≈øelf Ma≈øter of the Quarter-Deck, broke open the Arm-Che≈øt, which, on a ≈ølight Su≈øpicion of Mutiny, had been ordered there a few Days before, as to a Place of the greate≈øt Security. Here he took it for grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed he ≈øhould find Cutla≈ø≈øes ≈øufficient for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf and his Companions, in the U≈øe of which they were all extremely ≈økilful; and with the≈øe, it was imagined, they purpo≈øed to force the Great Cabin. But on opening the Che≈øt,
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:007859_0322_102DC70DA18AC2F0"/>there appeared nothing but Fire-Arms, which to them were of no U≈øe. There were indeed Cutla≈ø≈øes in the Che≈øt, but they were hid by the Fire Arms being laid over them. This was a ≈øen≈øible Di≈øappointment to them; and by this Tme <hi>Pizarro</hi> and his Companions in the Great Cabin were capable of conver≈øing aloud, thro' the Cabin Windows and Port<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holes, with tho≈øe in the Gun-room and be<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tween Decks; and from hence they learnt that the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> (whom they principally ≈øu≈øpected) were all ≈øafe below, and had not intermeddled in this Mutiny; and by other Particulars they at la≈øt di≈øcover'd, that none were concern'd in it but <hi>Orellana</hi> and his People.

With this View <hi>Pizarro</hi> got together what Arms were in the Cabin, and di≈øtributed them to tho≈øe who were with him; but there were no other Fire-Arms to be met with but Pi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tols, and for the≈øe they had neither Powder nor Ball. However, having now ≈øettled a Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re≈øpondence with the Gun-room, they lower<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed down a Bucket out of the Cabin Window,
<pb n="301" facs="unknown:007859_0323_102DE927667C3028"/>into which the Gunner, out of one of the Gun-room Ports, put a Quantity of Pi≈øtol Cartriges. When they had thus procured Ammunition, and had loaded their Pi≈øtols, they ≈øet the Cabin Door partly open, and fired ≈øome Shot among the <hi>Indians</hi> on the Quarter-Deck, at fir≈øt without Effect; but at la≈øt <hi>Mendinuetta,</hi> whom we have often menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>After this all was quiet; and the Admiral, finding that none of the <hi>Engli≈øh</hi> were engaged in this In≈øurrection, for a few Days treated us with a little Humanity, endeavouring to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage us, by large Promi≈øes of Preferment, to enter into the <hi>Spani≈øh</hi> Service. But finding nothing would work on us, we afterwards felt the Smart of his re≈øentment by a ≈øevere U≈øage.</p>
            <p>Nothing remarkable happened afterwards, more than what commonly happens at Sea, till
<pb n="302" facs="unknown:007859_0324_102DE9290E7026D8"/>we arrived at <hi>Concubene,</hi> a Harbour about Five Leagues to the South of Cape <hi>Fini≈øterre;</hi> which was the latter End of <hi>February,</hi> 1745-6.</p>
