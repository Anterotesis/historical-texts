            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>The Special Military Commiſſion, eſtabliſhed at Bourdeaux, by a deciſion of the Repreſentative of the People YSABEAU, bearing the date of yeſterday, in order to try LACOMBE, and his Accomplices—has paſſed the following Sentence: to which have aſſiſted, Citizens LATASTE, Preſident; A. FRIGIERE, SEGUY, AZEVEDO, and CLOCHARD, members of the ſaid Commiſſion.</p>
            <p>THEY brought to the bar, a man who called himſelf Jean Baptiſt Lacombe, a native of Toulouſe, having his domicil in Bourdeaux, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trict of the ſame in the department of Bec d' Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>be's; the ſaid man about 35 years old; formerly a ſchool-maſter, and preſident to the late mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary commiſſion at Bourdeaux.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:028941_0004_0FDDB66945EDF1C0"/>
Citizen DEREY, war commiſſary and public accuſer, ſaid:</p>
            <p>CITIZENS,</p>
            <p>Lacombe, is accuſed of having perpetrated the moſt horrid crimes, and that under the maſk of all virtues. The papers of the proceſs will prove, that nobody ever betrayed ſo boldly the confidence of the people, and of its repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; that the diſcharge of judicial duty, was never ſo ſhamefully abuſed, theſe papers will prove that a greater criminal, did never fix up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on himſelf the attention of Juſtice.</p>
            <p>Theſe papers are numerous; time has been ſhort to read them, and to compare together the facts they contain. I could ſcarcely copy the reſult of them; but the public is conſumed with the thirſt of juſtice; it is important to yield to its impatience; this impatience is that of republican virtues: The people want a great example of ſeverity, let this example be granted.</p>
            <p>The papers were read, after which the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic accuſer ſpoke again as follows:</p>
            <p>CITIZENS,</p>
            <p>You have juſt heard the reading of the docu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the proceſs; they exhibit to you the moſt hideous picture; you ſee thereby Lacombe,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028941_0005_0FDDB66949CBACD8"/>
to be ſucceſſively a ſhark, a prevaricating ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, a counter-revolutioniſt, and always a hypocrite.</p>
            <p>Let us follow him in the three periods of his life, in order that we may form to ourſelves a juſt idea of his baſeneſs, and of the wickedneſs of his diſpoſition.</p>
            <p>What has been his conduct previous to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volution? How did he behave himſelf ſince the revolution, and before his getting in the office of preſident of the military commiſſion? How did he behave himſelf in the various emergencies of this duty?</p>
            <p>What has been his conduct previous to the revolution? He himſelf informs us that he was born in Toulouſe; he ſays that he followed there the line of a teacher, and that he came to ſettle in Bourdeaux, about ten years ago.</p>
            <p>Lacombe a tutor! What man is this to teach youth the principles of morality, to unfold in their minds the ſeeds of the virtues therein ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by nature!</p>
            <p>He was twenty eight years old when he came to Bourdeaux: He was married. His wife de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028941_0006_0FDDB66D5F10E180"/>
that they were poor at Toulouſe, and that, on their arriving at Bourdeaux, they had got but a little money along with their cloaths. What!—Lacombe who had been ſucceſsful at Toulouſe in the line of a teacher, was deprived of almoſt everything when he arrived at Bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deaux.</p>
            <p>But, citizens, a fact which ought to have fixed your attention, inſpires us with the moſt unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable ſuſpicions concerning his fame in Tou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſe. He left, doubtleſs, Toulouſe on the on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly account of his being there too publicly known, and he came to Bourdeaux, becauſe the population, commerce and opulency of this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant city, unhappily warrant to an intriguing man more reſources and more means to conceal the baſeneſs of his actions, and to impoſe upon others: Recall to your minds the declaration of citizen Merzeau, one of the moſt ancient, of the moſt ſincere and moſt virtuous republicans. You have ſeen Lacombe to partake of the theft of a carriage from Colineau, a coach-maker on Tourny-walks; you have ſeen him to partake of a theft of books 1800 livers worth from Ducot a bookſeller; you have ſeen him accompanied by a fellow, who acted the part of an Engliſh Lord, in order to impoſe more eaſily both upon the coach-maker and bookſeller; you have after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028941_0007_0FDDB66F033D6FF0"/>
ſeen him ſtealing linens, worth 800 livres, from citizen Merzeau; and how did he ſteal theſe linens? In order to impoſe upon citizen Merzeau, he ſent his wife, elegantly dreſſed in a coach, and ſhe picked out and carried away theſe linens. It is thus that this tutor, who had obtained great ſucceſſes in Toulouſe, did ground his new ſucceſſes in Bourdeaux; it is thus that he taught his family the art of craf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs and knavery; it is thus that, by miſuſing the weakneſs of his wife, he made her an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>complice of his criminal baſeneſs! Theſe facts, and a thouſand others, with which the public voice reproaches him, ſhow clearly enough what man Lacombe was, previous to the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. Let us ſee what he has been ſince that epoch.</p>
            <p>Every one is ſenſible that there are every where intriguers, impoſters and atrocious men, who took up the revolutionary maſk to veil their plots, to deceive the people and its repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, to get in the public offices, and to cruſh liberty to pieces.</p>
            <p>There is no liberty without virtue; there is no liberty where licentiouſneſs is; but alas! How ſhall we have this republican principle adopted by men, whoſe whole country's love conſiſts but
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028941_0008_0FDDB6705FEAE600"/>
in the violence of their declamations! By men who cry aloud for the only purpoſe of impoſing upon the candour and credulity of a generous and truſtful public; by men who are always ſpeaking about republicaniſm, and who ſhelter in their hearts all the furies of deſpotiſm; by men who ſpeak of virtue, and have their hearts ſtained by the moſt hideous vices; by men who talk of liberty, to fetter and ſlave their fellow-citizens?</p>
            <p>In the year 1790, Lacombe kept a boarding-ſchool, in a houſe rented to him by citizen Liſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leferme; he bought from a widow woman, ſix or ſeven tuns of wine, for the uſe, ſaid he, of his boarders. That wine had not been paid for, and it became neceſſary for Lacombe, to draw both his wine and himſelf from the proſecutions of the widow. He contrived to ſuppoſe a ſale of the wine, to a man by the name of Poireau, a writing maſter, and to declare that Poireau had paid for it beforehand; this wine was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried away, and Lacombe removed to another houſe; inſomuch that the widow, who had a claim to make for the price of her wine, was, for a while, at a loſs to know what had become both of her wine and Lacombe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:028941_0009_0FDDB67556956328"/>
Luckily for her, Poireau pretended that the ſale agreed upon between Lacombe and him was ſincere. Lacombe behaved himſelf violently to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Poireau; this was the motive which car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried the two knaves before the municipal of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficer; they were giving to one another the name of rogue, when they arrived before him; they were both put under arreſt, but as they were together in a room, theſe honeſt people ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted their differences.</p>
            <p>The municipal officer repealed the order of their arreſt; but, as he ſuſpected that their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilement had been made at the expence of the widow, he cauſed her to be informed of it; and ſhe ſeized upon her wine in the dwelling houſe of Poireau. This ſeizing of the wine, gave place to a ſuit before the juſtice of St. Seurin, who compelled both Lacombe and Poireau to pay for the wine; thus the ſhame of this rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bery remained alone with theſe two men.</p>
            <p>Lacombe has therefore given himſelf up to the exceſſes of the baſeſt cupidity, as well ſince, as before the revolution.</p>
            <p>Endowed with ſome talents, but rather a prattler than a thinker, Lacombe ſeemed to
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028941_0010_0FDDB677E921B578"/>
throw himſelf headlong in the revolution; he was, according to himſelf, the ſcourge of ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy; he ſucceeded effectively in dazzling pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triots.</p>
            <p>He went to St. Foi, and opened a ſchool there; but it is probable that neither his beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour nor his manners could obtain him the good will of the inhabitants; his undertaking proved abortive.</p>
            <p>He has been bold enough to ſay that he had left St. Foi, on account of that place abounding with ariſtocrats and moderates. Citizens, this is a forgery which he has contrived to veil the true motives of his coming back to Bourdeaux. St. Foi, is claſſed among the towns which have conſtantly proved patriots; we have ſeen, and we even now behold, very worthy citizens from that community, truſted with public of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices, and juſtifying more and more by their equity, humanity and other republican virtues, the choice made of them by the repreſentatives of the people.</p>
            <p>The ill fate of Bourdeaux, raiſed up in its bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom ſome wicked men who, in concert with the intriguing deputies from the Gironde, abuſed even the deluded patriotiſm of the citizens of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:028941_0011_0FDDB67E11392E00"/>
this large city, in order to hurry them into li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berticide meaſures. Theſe traitors aimed at fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deraliſm, and they cloaked their plots under their oaths of the unity and indiviſibility of the republic, and of their attachment to the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Convention.</p>
            <p>The National Convention, juſtly irritated, propoſed to employ no means, but the juſtice which they are indebted for to the French peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as well as to their own dignity; the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal revenge threatened then a multitude of ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens.</p>
            <p>It was at that time that Lacombe left St. Foi, and reaſſumed his reſidence at Bourdeaux; as bold and apt to all that could forward his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune as he was, he joined with thoſe he had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore dazzled by his ſpeeches about his own vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues and patriotiſm. The citizens whoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony he might have dreaded, were ſtruck with ſorrow and terror; they did no more ſhow themſelves. Lacombe profited by this inſtant of terror; he dreads no more the language of truth; he well knew how to imitate both the diſcourſes and manners of patriotiſm; they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim him the moſt inexorable enemy to ariſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cracy and federaliſm; his ſupporters praiſe his talents and virtues; they are nearly ſuppoſing him to be endowed with the manners of a Spar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tan;

both people and their repreſentatives are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed upon, he is truſted with the office of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſident to the military commiſſion.</p>
            <p>Such a man was Lacombe from the epoch of the revolution, to the unlucky inſtant when by his intrigues he got in the ſtation of preſident to the military commiſſion; he was alternatively contemptible and impudent; he was never a patriot; is it poſſible to be ſo with a corrupted heart? He returned to Bourdeaux, only when he had a certainty to profit by the terror and ſilence of patriots, and to be at liberty of ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing here about his virtues and patriotiſm, without the leaſt fear of being contradicted.</p>
            <p>Let us now follow him into the diſcharge of his duty, as preſident to the military commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>It is here that he entirely pulls off his maſk; he appears fierce and humane ſucceſſively: The rich counter revolutioniſt may be certain to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure his life by giving up his purſe to him; the guiltleſs, if he wiſhes to be diſcharged, ſhall be obliged to put his money by his innocence; the papers of the proceſs have exhibited to us the proofs of theſe odious bargains! It is thus that Lacombe, by proſtituting the ſacred duty of a
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:028941_0013_0FDDB683424EE1A0"/>
judge to his cupidity, haſtened the ſteps of the counter-revolution; by plundering together the counter-revolutioniſt, and the patriots, he ſtrengthened the tyrannical hopes of the former and reduced the latter to diſpair.</p>
            <p>Let us fix our attention upon ſome of the facts, which are proved by the papers of the proceſs.</p>
            <p>We have ſeen the relations of Journu-Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert, determined to do all in their power to ſave their relative who was out-lawed; they went ſo far as to offer 300,000 livres: Bizat, for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly a lawyer, was charged to make the ſame offer to Rey, a baker, the friend of Lacombe and the manager of the pecuniary propoſals made to him, and of the out-bidding of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of his duty. Rey aſked for a delay of two days after which he anſwered to Bizat that his offer had been accepted; aſſignats to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of 205,000 livres were therefore deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, and they depoſited bills for the reſidue of 95,000 livres.</p>
            <p>Mean while Journu-Aubert, who was igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the ſteps made in his behalf by his rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, having proved with the repreſentative of the people, both his innocence and patriotiſm, was reſtored to law. Such an event was calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to diſappoint our intriguers. The relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:028941_0014_0FDDB684A7B9B938"/>
of Journu claimed again the 205,000 livres they had paid; it was impoſſible to detain this money; the juſtice juſt done by the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Yſabeau, to a well known patriot, ſtopped that of Lacombe; he felt therefore himſelf dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to the neceſſity of repairing the money; but he delayed more and more; he gave it back a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain by little and little; and as if he had ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that the relations of Journu ought to be grateful for his having been kind enough to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a ſum of one hundred thouſand crowns, he has kept for himſelf a ſum of about 70 or 75000 livres.</p>
            <p>The very declaration of Bizat informs us that Bory, a brother-in-law of Journu, had agreed to give up 55,000 livres, as a reward for the pains which had been taken.</p>
            <p>But remark the cunning of Lacombe and his aſſociates; they maſked this ſhameful extortion under the name of a fine, to which, ſaid they, Journu could poſſibly be condemned; as if a fine was to be depoſited with the preſident of the tribunal, as if a fine was to be paid before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hand, as if Journu was to be condemned before being heard and before the reading of his juſtification; as if the judges forming the tribunal together with Lacombe, ought not to perceive and judge but by his eyes.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:028941_0015_0FDDB68A500B8B40"/>
Almoſt every day is marked out by ſome new prevarication.—He extorted 7200 livres from citizen Chappel.</p>
            <p>He extorted 48,000 livres for his releaſing ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen Beaux.—32,000 livres from citizen Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayre, viz.—20,000 livres before the arreſtation of his brother, by promiſing that none of the two brothers ſhould be arreſted, and 12,000 livres after the one being arreſted. Citizens, perfidy and a wanton outrage to the liberty of citizens, are found here by the moſt impudent concuſſion.</p>
            <p>He extorted 160,000 livres from citizen Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeur, and as the emiſſary of Lechangeur, cried out upon ſo exceſſive an extortion, (for Lacombe would at firſt have 200,000 livres,) Lacombe anſwered to him, <q>who wouldſt thou have to pay, if monied people do not! I have got children, I muſt ſecure them a fortune.</q> Wicked man! didſt thou not perceive that the moſt precious inheritance to be left to our chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, is the remembrance of their father dying in a ſtate of indigence; they then have, at leaſt, the certainty of their property being not ſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by any crime.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:028941_0016_0FDDB68B74E588D0"/>
He extorted 58,000 livres from John Tartey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron.</p>
            <p>He had extorted 60,000 livres from citizen Caſtarede, and 13,200 livres from the female citizen Dubergier. Lacombe, whom remorſe had not been able to attain, was afraid ſome days ſince to be diſcovered; he cauſed there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſum of 13,200 livres to be returned to citizen Dubergier, as well as that of 60,000 li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vres to citizen Caſtarede, ſome days previous to his being arreſted.</p>
            <p>The cupidity of Lacombe and his aſſociates, acted upon trifling ſums, as well as upon conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ones. The wife of Bujac, having but an indifferent eſtate, gave 1200 livres with the hope of ſaving her huſband: And notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that, Buzac was condemned to death.</p>
            <p>The brothers Pimentel, gave ſome laces to the wife of Lacombe; ſome days after, Lacombe ſuppoſing to be in want of 6,000 livres, addreſſed himſelf to citizen Beraud, that he ſhould bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for him this ſum from theſe merchants. The money was accordingly borrowed by Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raud; but Lacombe who, without doubt, wiſhed to appropriate the ſum to himſelf without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expoſed to any proſecution on that account,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:028941_0017_0FDDB690B615DEF8"/>
urged citizen Beraud to bind himſelf towards Pimentel; Beraud refuſed and Lacombe did not receive the money.</p>
            <p>Lacombe was poſſeſſed of conſiderable ſums; he would lodge that of 52,000 livres with citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen Perayre; on his refuſal, this ſum was lodged with citizen Aequart.</p>
            <p>Lebrun, a director to the National Cuſtom-Houſe, was arreſted; his friends offered to give 100,000 livres, but it was too late; Lebrun had now been brought before the military commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. Lacombe fearing therefore to be ſuſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, anſwered the offers by ſaying that they had been delayed too long, and Rey added, that Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brun would otherwiſe have been ſaved; it is thus that the lives of citizens became, with Lacombe, an object of ſpeculation without troubling himſelf about diſtinguiſhing republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cans from ariſtocrats.</p>
            <p>Citizens, I hurry this recital, unſufferable for righteous men.</p>
            <p>You have ſeen the female citizen Bujac, giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing 1200 livres as the price of ſaving her huſband, Bujac, who was condemned.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:028941_0018_0FDDB692289BDFC0"/>
Another deed of the ſame kind, but more important, another crime more deliberately atrocious has been perpetrated.</p>
            <p>The wife of Dudon, as did that of Bujac, wiſhed to buy the life of her huſband; ſhe gave one hundred louis' in ſpecie: By receiving them Lacombe exclaimed againſt the ſmallneſs of the ſum, ſaying that he wanted at leaſt one thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand louis'; Rey reported theſe words to the wife of Dudon, ſhe objected her impoſſibility of procuring ſo large a ſum; her anſwer was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by Rey to Lacombe, and this odious judge cried out, "ſhe will repent of it;" he then charged Rey, to tell the woman that ſhe muſt find out this ſum in three days; ſhe could not, Dudon was ſentenced, and Lacombe kept up the one hundred louis' he had received. What a horrid proſtitution of his duty, of the life of men and of the laws!</p>
            <p>But the mind is overwhelmed, at the recital of ſuch horrors! do I want, citizens, to retrace here all the crimes which Lacombe has perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated? Is it not enough of what I ſaid, to raiſe up your indignation, and to arm you with the ſword of the laws?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:028941_0019_0FDDB696F393D3B0"/>
He denied theſe facts at firſt in the examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he underwent; but as he found himſelf urged on account of the aſſignats diſcovered in ſome tin boxes, which he had hidden in the garret of his houſe, he ſaid that ſome ariſtocrats, the enemies which his faithful diſcharge of his duty bad raiſed up againſt him, had probably and wickedly brought theſe aſſignats into his garret; ſuch a ridiculous evaſion would betray ſufficiently his crime, but his brother and Rey, who were his agents, have aſſerted that the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignats, this ſhameful offspring of his extortions, had been brought into the garret but in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance of his directions.</p>
            <p>But he has afterwards confeſſed ſeveral of his exactions; he declared that he had given to Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſſe, another of his agents, a ſum of 3,000 livres out of that he had received from the fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male citizen Dubergier.</p>
            <p>He has confeſſed that Rey had delivered to him a ſum of 6,000 livres out of the 48,000 livres exacted from citizen Beaux.</p>
            <p>Should we be reduced to theſe two confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, they would be a full proof of his concuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:028941_0020_0FDDB69830E82C10"/>
But he made other avowals, which juſtice ought to preſerve carefully; he ſaid in a letter to citizen Plenaud, that he had been miſled by a deſire to have his family rich; to which he ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded that he had denied every thing in his exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination on account of two very natural mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives; the one a deſire to conceal his weakneſs, the other on account of the indignation he felt, at the odious and artful calumnies of the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Rey.</p>
            <p>He had therefore denied every thing, and this avowal from his own, is a proof of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity of Rey's declaration.</p>
            <p>He ſays that he had denied every thing, in order to conceal his weakneſs; he therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſes to have perpetrated thoſe concuſſions of which he is accuſed: We differ, he and I, but about words; he calls weakneſs, what I call a horrid crime. A judge truſted with the moſt rigorous duty, that of puniſhing the enemies of the republic, and, with the utmoſt impartiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, of diſcerning them from its ſincere friends, ſuch a judge trading about juſtice, is a monſter whom the world ought to get rid of! Such a judge is a declared enemy to the republic, for we now are in a ſtate of revolution, and it is only by his fully executing the revolutionary
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:028941_0021_0FDDB69D3394C5E0"/>
laws and by his practiſing the virtues which are the order of the day, that a judge can ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt himſelf a true friend to the revolution.</p>
            <p>He denied the facts too, ſaid he, becauſe he wiſhed to conceal the indignation he felt, at the odious and artful calumnies of the infamous Rey.</p>
            <p>The infamous Rey! But, ſince Rey is an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous man, what epithet ſhall we affix upon Lacombe? Is it not manifeſt, that it is he who has employed Rey, as his agent?</p>
            <p>Recall again, citizens, to your minds the odi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous aſcendency he had aſſumed upon Rey. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times he threatened him with the guillotine, in caſe he ſhould dare to unveil his myſteries, add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that he had power enough to cauſe citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens to be impriſoned, without imparting it to the committee of ſurveillance, to cauſe them to be ſentenced, and to pull off the head of whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever would be daring enough to inſpire him with any fears. When Rey communicated to him his apprehenſion for their common fate, No, no, ſaid Lacombe, no puniſhment will reach me in the ſtation I am in; thou wouldſt certainly be expoſed, if it were not for thy complying with what I preſcribe to thee. Thou art the maſter
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:028941_0022_0FDDB69E318189C8"/>
of my ſecret, ſaid he once to Rey, but I am the maſter of thy life.</p>
            <p>Lacombe, however confeſſes himſelf guilty, but of weakneſs only; he likewiſe calls Rey an infamous man; we muſt ſuppoſe him to be very familiar with crimes, and his mind to be ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſubjected to his heart, to a heart eſſential<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vicious, as well as to that egotiſm which com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled him to trample upon the moſt ſacred duty; which, before his eyes, gives to his crimes the phyſiognomy of weakneſs only, and that of crime to the condeſcenſions, to which he was artful enough, to drive a man who has, at leaſt, the merit of ſincerity.</p>
            <p>Citizens, facts numerous enough, have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced you, and the denials of Lacombe will not ſhake your conviction; but he ſhall be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled himſelf to give up that crafty juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. He has been examined by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of ſurveillance; he has been confronted with Rey and Bizot, who had before given their evidences and declarations. Rey and Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zot have maintained to him, before the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee, the truth of all the facts they had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared, and no one of thoſe who have witneſſed thoſe debates, in which Lacombe unfolded the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:028941_0023_0FDDB6A3AD6DDA30"/>
whole art of falſehood and hypocriſy, enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains no doubt of his being guilty.</p>
            <p>What is the conſequence of theſe facts?</p>
            <p>Lacombe, at the happy epoch of the revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, behaved himſelf, as did many others whoſe element was corruption. Recall again, citizens, to your minds the theft, of about ſix or ſeven tuns of wine, and how he was reprimanded on that account by the municipal, who diſcharged then the duty of policy. Lacombe had before vehemently talked about liberty! Virtue and a regeneration of manners; but he uttered a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, which was a ſtrange one to his heart; he pretended himſelf to be at the height of liberty, and he was in reality creeping in the mire of corruption.</p>
            <p>That ſpirit, with which he was inſpired did not fail him, when he was promoted to the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice of preſident to the military commiſſion. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his crimes, they all partake of his propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity to the moſt infamous cupidity; it was that cupidity which, almoſt always, put his paſſions into movement, which prompted him into the moſt odious bargains, which induced him to weigh in the ſame ſcale with gold, the lives of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:028941_0024_0FDDB6A4DA94B3E8"/>
citizens. It was that cupidity, which induced him to place in the ſame ſcale the ariſtocrat and patriot, which purſuaded him to ſpare the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of the revolution, provided he would pay the money exacted from him, and to keep fainting in the anguiſh of terror the patriot, who has no money to give, or who would bluſh in giving it as a price for his innocence and patriotiſm.</p>
            <p>We are ſenſible that thoſe who have been ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenced to death, did, generally ſpeaking, merit it; either they were ariſtocrats, or they had a ſhare in tyrannical meaſures; but by entering into bargains with them, by his ſtriving to ſave them for money, he plainly partakes of the crime of counter-revolution, concealed in the hearts of ſuch men; it mattered him but very little whether liberty ſhould be deſtroyed, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided he could acquire riches.</p>
            <p>But a thing which makes humanity tremble, is, to behold Lacombe, entering into contracts with the enemies to the revolution, ſentencing them to death, and notwithſtanding keeping their money from them. What a ſpecula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion! What a horrid and cool-blood temper!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:028941_0025_0FDD5EEEE1E932B8"/>
Let us obſerve, citizens, that the revolution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary circumſtances we are now under, want on behalf of every public officer, a revoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onary behaviour; let us particularly obſerve that Lacombe was a preſident to a military commiſſion, ſpecially calculated to guide, and to haſten the ſteps of the revolution. The crime of a prevaricator, ought, therefore, to be looked upon as a crime of counter-revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; the public functioner who contrives means to ſave a counter-revolutioniſt ſhould be looked upon as a counter-revolutioniſt himſelf, and muſt undergo the puniſhment which the law directs againſt the declared ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the republic.</p>
            <p>Citizens, the public opinion was ſome time ſince riſing againſt Lacombe; the repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the people Yſabeau, was on the point to order his being arreſted, when his powers were repealed by the committee of public ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.</p>
            <p>Lacombe himſelf was affrighted, there is the motive for his, on one ſide, informing the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentative Yſabeau, that it would be impru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent for him to ſtay any longer at Bourdeaux, and, on the other ſide, for his delivering back,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:028941_0026_0FDDB6AC1F106098"/>
to thoſe who had given them to him, the ſums and jewels he had received.</p>
            <p>The repreſentative Garnier of Xaintes, was not long before he became acquainted with the diſpoſition of Lacombe, the report of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varications reached him, and Lacombe was ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted.</p>
            <p>Citizens, I ſaw you trembling at the recital of ſo many crimes; You have aſked yourſelves, how ſuch a man could have been committed to diſcharge the duty of a revolutionary juſtice.</p>
            <p>It is to your misfortunes, to your errors, to that unlawful federaliſm, to which Bourdeaux was driven, that you are indebted for ſuch a ſcourge, the repreſentatives of the people ſent to reſtore this important city to the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of the unity and indiviſibility of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public, could find any where, but men bran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with federaliſm. Lacombe artfully pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by this emergency. Generous people are truſtful; the repreſentatives were impoſed up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Lacombe was choſen. The wicked and counter-revolutionary deſigns of Lacombe ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded the righteous and benevolent deſigns of the repreſentatives. The terror with which he inſpired every one, unhappily conſtrained
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:028941_0027_0FDDB6B098EAF7A0"/>
for a long time, the complaints of citizens. But truth has reached the repreſentatives of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; juſtice and humanity will be triumphant, both the republic and citizens, will be reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
            <p>In conſequence of the proofs reſulting from the papers of the proceſs, I demand that Jean Baptiſte Lacombe, lately a ſchool-maſter and the preſident of the military commiſſion eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in Bourdeaux; be condemned to death, and that in conformity to the law paſſed on the 27th of March 1793; that he in conſequence be given up to the executioner, and carried to the national ſquare, in order to undergo the ſaid puniſhment; I likewiſe demand, that his eſtate be declared forfeited to the benefit of the repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, and that the ſentence paſſed upon him be printed, publiſhed and poſted up every where it ſhall be requiſite.</p>
