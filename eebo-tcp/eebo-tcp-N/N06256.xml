            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>A FUNERAL ELOGIUM, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>IT has been the laudable practice of all ages, to perpetuate the memory of their illuſtrious dead, either by erecting to their fame, monuments of the moſt durable materials; or immortalizing their names, in the faithful pages of hiſtory. Theſe methods, of expreſſing our eſteem, are indeed of no avail to the deceaſed; but to be conſidered as grateful memorials of their ſuperior merit; and to prevent time, which molders away their mortal part, from obliterating the remembrance of their
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:007933_0003_102E038B308AA2C0"/>virtues. They are, moreover, of ſingular uſe, to inſpire poſterity with an emulation of examples ſo deſervedly honoured, and tranſmitted to futurity with ſuch eminent marks of diſtinction. Hence there is, perhaps, not a more uſeful ſtudy than that of BIOGRAPHY, which preſents to our view the glorious patterns of antiquity; and while the amiable portraits are paſſing before our eyes, can ſcarcely fail of imprinting on our minds, ſome beautiful and ſtriking lineament. To ſee virtue and vice exemplified in real life, is inſtead of a thouſand lec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and infuſes greater veneration and horror, than whole volumes of moral philoſophy. And, when fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally, we conſider, that all thoſe celebrated characters have long ſince ſubmitted to the inevitable ſtroke of fate, ſuch a reflection will out-preach the preacher, and more effectually than the boy at PHILIP'S ear, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind us of our own mortality. But ſhall heroes and conquerors, ingroſs the admiration of poſterity, while the chriſtian and the patriot, lie buried in oblivion? Shall the ſplendor of martial renown, wholly extinguiſh the mild—the gentle luſtre of private worth? Is not the
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:007933_0004_102E038DB8B380C0"/>ſage, the philoſopher, and the friend, who diffuſed joy and happineſs all around him, as worthy the funeral eulogy, as thoſe victorious ravagers who ſeatter famine and war; and owe the blaze of their glory to the terror of their arms?</p>
            <p>To have all the qualifications that render a man amiable or great;—to be the object of delight wherever one is known;—to poſſeſs learning, genius, and ſubli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of ſoul;—can there be born a greater bleſſing to the world? To exert thoſe ſhining endowments for the benefit of mankind, and employ a great and elevated ſpirit, only in doing great and diffuſive good.—Can a nobler uſe be made of the happieſt talents? Amidſt ſuch ſtriking colours, in ſo degenerate an age, who can miſtake the picture of the excellent deceaſed, whoſe memory theſe pages are intended to celebrate?</p>
            <p>CAN you image to yourſelf, a perſon modeſt in proſperity, prudent in difficulty, in buſineſs indefati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gable, magnanimous in danger, eaſy in his manners,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:007933_0005_102E038FF0344D30"/>of exquiſite judgment, of profound learning, catholic in ſentiment, of the pureſt morals, and great even in the minuteſt things.—Can you image ſo accompliſhed a perſon, without recollecting the idea of the late PRESIDENT BURR?</p>
            <p>WHETHER we conſider him in a private, or public view, he is ſtill equally ſtriking, equally diſtinguiſhed; and, without exaggerated expreſſion, ſomething ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſing the ordinary bounds of human nature.</p>
            <p>FEW were more perfect in the art of rendering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves agreeable in company. 'Twas in thoſe ſocial mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, when frequently the human mind lies all open and ungarded, that he blended improvement with delight; and happily tempered the ſerious with the gay. His knowledge of men unfolded to him all the avenues to the heart, which he could variouſly affect with wonderful dexterity. Nothing is more difficult, than to pleaſe in converſation, without betraying a deſign to pleaſe, which never fails to diſguſt. Pride
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:007933_0006_102E03918EA3CD80"/>cannot bear to be diverted by a companion, who, under the diſguiſe of entertaining others, appears intent on ſecuring his own applauſe. Hence good nature and modeſty, with a ſlender ſhare of ingenuity and reading, generally carry the palm againſt wit and erudition, attended with oſtentation and parade. Of this ſo ſenſible was the PRESIDENT, that unleſs the ſubject required it, no one would have ſuſpected his learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and when it did, every one was aſtoniſhed how a perion ſo immerſed in books, had acquired ſo large a ſhare of eaſe in converſe, and freedom of behaviour. But in him every thing was agreeable, becauſe every thing was natural: and he had the ſecret to be inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately familiar, without degrading the dignity of his function. As he had not ſtudied the philoſophers, without ſacrificing to the graces; ſo neither in the ſallies of humour, did he ever forget the character of a DIVINE. In a word, his open benevolent and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſſembling heart, inſpired all around him with innocent chearfulneſs; and made every one who knew him, court his engaging ſociety.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:007933_0007_102E0394004C4B40"/>
IN his FRIENDSHIPS how varm! how ſincere! how refined and diſintereſted! Power, with her mighty arm, may extort a reluctant ſubmiſſion: Wealth, with her golden lure, may attract the obſequi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous levée: Honour, with its ſurrounding blaze, may dazzle the wondering multitude: And eloquence, with her enchanting voice, bewitch the tranſported audience. But neither power, with her mighty arm; nor wealth, with her golden lure; nor honour, with its ſurrounding blaze; nor eloquence with her inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice, can fix a ſingle heart, or procure a cordial friend.</p>
            <p>THO' a perſon of a ſlender and delicate make, to encounter fatigue he had a heart of ſteel; and for the diſpatch of buſineſs, the moſt amazing talents, joined to a conſtancy of mind, that induced ſucceſs in ſpite of every obſtacle. As long as an enterprize appeared not abſolutely impoſſible, he knew no diſcouragement; but in proportion to its difficulty, augmented his dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence: and by an inſuperable fortitude, frequently
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:007933_0008_102E0396472B5F78"/>accompliſhed, what his friends and acquaintance con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived utterly impracticable. To his unparallel'd aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duity, next to the divine bleſſing, is doubtleſs to be aſcribed the preſent flouriſhing ſtate of the COLLEGE of NEW-JERSEY; which, from a meer private under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking, is in a few years, become the joy of its friends, and the admiration and envy of its enemies.</p>
            <p>HE was life and activity itſelf; and tho' cut off in the bloom and vigour of his years, attained, with reſpect to his public utility, the remoteſt period of old age. His every year was replete with good works; and while others cou'd here and there boaſt a ſhining action, like a ſcattered ſtar in the vaſt expanſe of heaven, his LIFE, like the milky way, was one continued univerſal glow.</p>
            <p>IN the ſacred ſcriptures, he was a perfect APOLLOS. Theſe were his conſtant ſtudy, the ſubject of his daily meditation: From theſe, he extracted his divinity: From theſe, the maxims of his conduct: and by theſe, was made wiſe unto ſalvation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:007933_0009_102E03989BC738A8"/>
HIS PIETY eclipſed all his other accompliſhments. He was ſteady in his faith; unfluctuating in principle; ardent in devotion; deaf to temptation; open to the motions of grace; without pride; without oftentation; full of GOD; evacuated of ſelf; having his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in heaven; ſeeing thro' the veil of mortality, the high deſtiny of man; breathing a ſpiritual life; and offering up a perpetual holocauſt of adoration and praiſe.</p>
            <p>I MENTION not his private CHARITY and ALMS. I ſay nothing of his PRAYERS, his FASTINGS and his WATCHINGS. I paſs by all thoſe virtues, which ſhunn'd applauſe, and ſought obſcurity and retirement. Theſe were only to be obſerved by that all-penetrating eye, which pervades immenſity; and to be noticed by that omniſcient judge, who ſeeth in ſecret, but will reward before the grand conſiſtory of angels and men.</p>
            <p>HOWEVER ſteady to his own principles, he was perfectly free from every appearance of BIGOTRY. He
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:007933_0010_102E039BC5E212B0"/>prized religion as an ineſtimable jewel, whoſe real va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lue was neither inhanced nor diminiſhed by the caſket in which it is depoſited. Hence he loved and revered the ſincere and exemplary of every communion; and particularly cultivated a ſtrict correſpondence, with ſeveral of the greateſt ornaments of the CHURCH eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed in ENGLAND; who, in their turn, treated him with the higheſt affection and reſpect.</p>
            <p>IN the PULPIT he ſhone with ſuperior luſtre. He was fluent, copious, ſublime and perſuaſive. The momentous truths, and awful myſteries of religion, ſo ſtrongly poſſeſſed his mind, that he ſpoke from the heart, which is the only way of ſpeaking to it. His language was intelligible to the meaneſt capacity; and above the cenſure of the greateſt genius. He was neither deſtitute of the ornaments of ſtile; nor ſo capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated with the flowers of rhetoric, as to bury beneath them, the fruits of improvement. More ſollicitous to penetrate the heart, than to amuſe the head, he aimed at perſpicuity; and inſtead of ſubtle ſpeculations and
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:007933_0011_102E039E9F38D7F8"/>metaphyſical diſtinctions, inculcated the luminous and uncontroverted truths of revelation. His invention was not ſo properly fruitful, as inexhauſtible; and his elocution equal to his ideas. Out of the well-ſtor'd treaſure of his mind, he produced things new and old; while his human literature, like an obſequious handmaid, was ever ready to ſet off and embelliſh her miſtreſs DIVINITY. He was none of thoſe "downy doctors," who ſooth their hearers into deluſive hopes of the divine acceptance; or ſubſtitute external morality, in the room of vital godlineſs: On the contrary, he ſcorned to proclaim the peace of GOD, 'till the rebel laid down his arms, and returned to his allegiance. He was an ambaſſador, that adhered inviolably to his inſtructions; nor ever acceded to a treaty, that would not be ratified in the court of heaven. He ſearched the conſcience with the terrors of the law, before he eſſuaged its anguiſh with the balm of Gilead, or pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed the ſweet emollients of a bleeding deity. He acted, in ſhort, like one not intruſted with the lives and fortunes, but the everlaſting intereſts of his fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortals;
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:007933_0012_102E03A0F8CDB7B0"/>and therefore made it his buſineſs to advance the divine life, and reſtore the beautiful image of GOD, disfigured by the apoſtacy of man—to repreſent religion as the offspring of light, and the parent of liberty and ſelf-dominion;—to expoſe the ſhadowy gratificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of pomp and power, and recommend the ſuperior exalted pleaſures of a conſtant intercourſe with the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of ſpirits, the fountain of life, and light and love;— to call our wandering thoughts from the ſyren allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the world and the fleſh, and direct them to the ſupreme magnet of ſouls, the center and origin of beatitude and perfection;—to enlighten the under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding; to reform the judgment; to regulate the paſſions, and to rectify the will.</p>
            <p>WHAT he preached in the pulpit, he lived out of it. His LIFE and EXAMPLE were a comment on his ſermons: and by his engaging deportment, he rendered the amiable character of a chriſtian ſtill more attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and lovely. In many, religion appears awkward and diſguſtful: In ſome, more agreeable and becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; in others, charming and ornamental; but in him
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:007933_0013_102E03A424F5CAC0"/>ſhe ſeemed to have erected her throne, and as it were doubled the beams of her majeſty.</p>
            <p>THE PASTORAL FUNCTION he diſcharged with equal fidelity and ſucceſs. To examine into the condition of his flock;—to watch againſt eſſential errors;—to inſtruct the ignorant;—to revive the diſconſolate;—to animate the penitent;—to reclaim the relapſing;—to confirm the irreſolute;—to humble the arrogant, and reprove the contumacious and immoral, were his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant and moſt delightful employments.</p>
            <p>FOR PUBLICK SPIRIT, and the love of his country, who ever ſurpaſſed this reverend patriot? Amidſt all the cares of his academical function, he thought, and ſtudied, and plan'd, and toil'd, for the common weal. He had a high ſenſe of engliſh liberty; and deteſted deſpotic power, as the bane of human happineſs. With him the hereſy of ARIUS was not more fatal to the purity of the goſpel, than the poſitions of FILMAR, to the dignity of man, or the repoſe of ſtates. Of our excellent conſtitution he entertained the
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:007933_0014_102E03A5C33CF2F0"/>juſteſt idea; and gloried in the privileges of a Briton, as much as he lamented their proſtitution and abuſe. If any thing ever ruffled the ſerenity of his mind, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides the prevalence of vice, it was the adverſe fortune and diſaſtrous ſituation of his country. His compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate boſom daily agonized, for the families bleeding by the ſword of the wilderneſs; or captivated by ruthleſs unrelenting ſavages. His MAJESTY'S arms un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful, and thoſe of the enemy victorious, fired him with a generous reſentment; and made him rouſe his fellow-ſubjects, to efface the memory of our former miſcarriage; and avenge the righteous quarrel of the BEST OF KINGS. How did he lament, that BRITAIN, the mother of heroes, the ſchool of patriots and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riors, the land of frugality and virtue, the native ſoil of liberty, that light of life and ſource of human bliſs! —that BRITAIN, which humbled the oppreſſors of the earth; and bade her navies carry her name in terror round the world, ſhould at length degenerate into the ſhameful ſeat of venality and corruption; become the nurſe of effeminacy, voluptuouſneſs, and riot; the vile
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:007933_0015_102E03A9F2D80590"/>receptacle of impurity, ſloth and dejection; and ſo ignominiouſly forget her primitive martial proweſs, as to brook the inſults of a people, formerly trembling at her name; and for every indignity, feeling the ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance of her arms!</p>
            <p>IN propagating the goſpel among the heathen natives, how aſſiduous a CORRESPONDENT of the SCOTCH SO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SIETY! He thought no labour, no difficulty too great, in the proſecution of ſo important an enterprize. An enterprize, moſt benevolently calculated, to illumine the gloomy wilderneſs with the beams of evangelical truth; and proclaim the reſurrection and the life, to thoſe who ſat in darkneſs and the ſhadow of death! By the ſmiles of heaven, on the pious endeavours of that VENERABLE BODY; and the zealous activity of ſome of their miſſionaries, many are undoubtedly converted from paganiſm to chriſtianity; and from the error of their ways, to the LIVING GOD. How illuſtrious an atchievement, to lead the worſhippers of deceaſed heroes and infernal ſpirits, to the knowledge of the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007933_0016_102E03AC39CCA180"/>UNIVERSAL CREATOR AND FATHER OF ALL! To transform rocks and mountains, till then the pagods of ſuperſtition and polytheiſm, into ſo many Bethels to the LORD OF HOSTS!—To render the howling deſart, hitherto reſounding with idolatrous orgies, divinely vocal with the praiſes of GOD, and his anoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted MESSIAH! —To prepare, in fine, the obdurate heart of barbariſm for the influences of the HOLY GHOST; and repleniſh the huts of ſavages with the diſciples of JESUS!</p>
            <p>WITH what dignity and reputation, did he ſuſtain the office of PRESIDENT! Senſible how important to the public, and thro' the whole thread of our exiſtence, is the early culture of the human mind, he conſidered himſelf, with the painter of old, as "deſigning for eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity". He had the moſt engaging method of inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; nor inferior to the extent of his capacity, was his facility in communicating. No man had a happier talent of expreſſing his ſentiments; or calling latent truth from her dark and profound receſſes. No man
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:007933_0017_102E03AE87B8F1A8"/>more capable of opening the mental ſoil, to the kindly rays of ſcience; or improving its fertility, with the gentle dews of expoſition and comment. Inſtead of turning any branch of learning, into inexplicable myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery, the common pride of pedagogues, he ſet the moſt intricate points in the cleareſt light, and ſtripp'd off all the ſcholaſtic clouds, that obſcured the ſimple majeſty of knowledge.</p>
            <p>NOR did he neglect any opportunity of imbuing the minds of his PUPILS with the ſeeds of VIRTUE, at the ſame time that he inriched them, with the treaſures of learning. And, indeed, if a pagan mythologiſt could obſerve, that to treat of the world, without ſaying any thing of its author, would be impious, what wonder that this divine philoſopher, in explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the appearances of the univerſe, ſhould trace the bright and conſpicuous footſteps of the deity, thro' every part of the magnificent ſyſtem of nature! What wonder, that he perpetually raiſed their thoughts, to the inviſible things of GOD, from the viſible wonders
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:007933_0018_102E03B01FF0ECF8"/>of his power; from the beautiful and ſtupendous fabric of the world, to the infinite all-governing ARCHITECT; and from the ſcatter'd rays to the IMMENSE OCEAN OF LIGHT!</p>
            <p>WITH the ſame eaſe, he ſecured the obedience and the love of the ſtudents. He had the art of leading the will by inviſible chains; and <q>making reaſon, no leſs prevalent than authority.</q> Who, like him, could puniſh an offence, not only without the reſentment, but with the approbation of the delinquent? Speak ye, who beſt can tell, ye ſons of the prophets, who experienced his affection; nor ever heard him pronounce puniſhment, without obſerving the trickling tear, and the reluctant heart? Surely, never will his idea be blotted from your memories; but in your walks, in your ſtudies, in your meditations and amuſements, you will ſee him, hear him, accoſt him, admire and deplore him.— With him, doubtleſs, had the MUSES deſerted their recent abode; and SCIENCE ruſted in her inexplicated volumes, had not the ſame all-gracious hand, which
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:007933_0019_102E03B26B2E0808"/>removed one preſident, inſtantly pointed out another: Perhaps the only one, capable of making us forget (could ſuch a calamity be ever forgotten) the loſs of his predeceſſor.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER diſguiſe the hypocrite may aſſume, at the approach of death, diſſimulation drops her maſt. When men have but a moment to live, it is no longer their intereſt to wear a vizard. In this preciſe view, let us therefore contemplate our illuſtrious friend. Than a DYING CHRISTIAN, the whole compaſs of nature affords not an object of more dignity, aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or grandeur. Come, ye miniſters of the LORD, behold a ſpectacle, even to you, of fruitful inſtruction. Behold the triumphs of grace, in the diſſolution of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture! What patience, what reſignation, what lively hope and divine affiance! See the king of terrors diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arm'd of his ſting; and vanquiſh'd in the very act of conquering! Behold heaven commencing on earth; and faith triumphant over pain, diſeaſe, and mortality! Wrapt in the thoughts of immortal life, he appears
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:007933_0020_102E03B6F9298B80"/>great even in the midſt of diſtreſs; and ſuffers with all the majeſty of woe. How auguſt in ruin! How immoveably fixt on the rock of ages! What peace paſſing underſtanding! What joy, what ineffable joy, in the HOLY GHOST! <q>O death, where is thy ſting? O grave, where is thy victory?</q>
            </p>
            <p>BUT what heart can conceive, what tongue can utter the anguiſh of his CONSORT? Alas! madam, that ſo bright a ſun ſhou'd decline ſo ſoon; and with it, your every joy and every comfort! An awful leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, againſt building our happineſs, except on the foundation of eternity. But why the unavailing tear, or fruitleſs lamentation? He is indeed a priſoner to the grave, but he is a priſoner of hope. Since the omnipotent captain of his ſalvation has ſubdued the laſt enemy, diſpoiled principalities and powers, and led captivity captive, the blaſts of death cannot deſtroy the buds of his virtue. Theſe are tranſported to the paradiſe of GOD, there to grow, and ſpread, and flouriſh, with unwithering and ever-blooming verdure.
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:007933_0021_102E03B89448C790"/>'Tis death alone, that affords a harbour, to all that embark on the ſea of this tempeſtuous life. But with him, the ſtorms that vex this turbulent ocean are blown over, and will moleſt no more. He has finiſhed the perillous voyage, and enjoys a ſecure anchorage in the calm haven of eternal reſt. He is where even you, madam, could not improve his happineſs. He is— and what a cruel kindneſs to regret his lot!—he is <q>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from all pain, reſolv'd of all doubt, purified from all ſin, delivered from all fear,</q> and happy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond hope, or the power of time and viciſſitude. Ceaſe then to weep an angel, whom you lov'd a man. Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther improve the alarming providence, and take ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuary in the conſolations of religion; and then, 'tis the voice of infallibility, "thy maker will be thy huſband." Thus will inſtruction ſpring from his very relicks; and wiſdom, the beſt of wiſdom, bloſſom on his ſepulchre.</p>
            <p>BUT what an unexpected ſtroke, and how univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſally deplored! See, how the churches put on their ſables, and mourn like a diſconſolate widow! Where
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:007933_0022_102E03BB065EE7B8"/>is the unſiowing eye, or the unſorrowing breaſt? O ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable man! friend! father! huſband! ſcholar and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine! and worthy a longer life, was the preſent life of any other value, than to ripen us for the next. But <q>great and marvellous are thy works, LORD GOD AL<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>MIGHTY! juſt and true are thy ways, thou KING of SAINTS.</q> At ſo dreadful a blow, and ſo glorious a change, who can weep, or who refrain from weeping? But will they not be guilty tears, that bemoan the bleſt tranſition, from this vale of humiliation and ſorrow, to the ſummit of immarceſſible honour and joy? We may indeed lament ourſelves, our country, and mankind, as bereſt of a friend; and the church of her ornament and boaſt: But we ſhould rejoice, that he has bequeath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us the ineſtimable legacy of his virtues; and that, "bleſſed are the dead who die in the LORD." Inſtead of effeminate wailings, let us therefore adorn his memory, by adopting his excellencies; and while nature drops the inevitable tear, let reaſon and religion crown his tomb with triumphant laurels.</p>
