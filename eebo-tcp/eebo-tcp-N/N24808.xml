            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">The preacher is ſenſible that many will ſuppoſe the text improper for the occaſion. It was choſen by the priſoner, and he could not be ſo well pleaſed with another. It appeared that what he ſuppoſed Divine light, and an aſtoniſhing view of God's character, broke in upon his mind, in reading this paſſage.</note>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>I HAVE choſen theſe words for the ſubject of my diſcourſe, by the particular deſire of the unhappy man, who is to be executed this day.—He conſiders himſelf held up before mankind, as a warning of the bitter conſequences of ſin; and the danger of living immorally and thoughtleſs of God. He has deſired me to employ the preſent ſhort opportunity, which we have for religious wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, both in adviſing him for his ſolemn appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance before the tribunal of his Judge, and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minding thoſe who are ſpectators, that unleſs we
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:032888_0003_0FF5C6D2AC27AE30"/>
repent we ſhall all likewiſe periſh; and that thoſe who forget God, and diſobey his commandments, though they may eſcape an ignominious end in this world, muſt in eternity expect to meet evils more dreadful than the pain or ſhame of an execution by the hands of men.</p>
            <p>THE occaſion is very ſolemn and affecting. I hope we may improve the hour in receiving in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction from this ſpectacle, and in earneſt prayer that the man who is ſoon to die, may find mercy and ſalvation in God before whom he is ſoon to come.</p>
            <p>THE ſcripture of which my text is a part, deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes the ſin of men; the reaſon of God's diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure with them; and the neceſſity and wiſdom of his judgments.</p>
            <p>I ſhall, Firſt, paraphraſe the text in connexion with the context.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, make ſuch an improvement as na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally ariſes from the paſſage and from the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of our meeting.</p>
            <p>IN the verſes before the text God ſays, <hi>O E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phraim what ſhall I do unto thee? O Judah what ſhall I do unto thee? for your goodneſs is as a morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cloud, and as the early dew it paſſeth away.—Therefore have I hewed them by my prophets; I have ſlain them by the words of my mouth: and thy judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are as the light that goeth forth. They like men have tranſgreſſed the covenant, there have they
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:032888_0004_0FF5C6D447B47D08"/>
dealt treacherouſly againſt me.</hi> This is a deſcription of their conduct, as it was ſeen by the eye of Om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſcience. Our text alſo deſcribes the temper and practice to which forgiveneſs is encouraged. <hi>For I deſire mercy more than ſacrifice; and the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God more than burnt offerings.</hi> Mercy and a knowledge of God, in this paſſage, mean true holineſs and a conformity of heart to the moral character of God, and ſpiritual obedience to his commandments. The men whom our text re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, had the means of religion and a doctrinal acquaintance with their duty. They had knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, inſtruction, and warning, as we have at the preſent day. They ſometimes reſolved and prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed a religious life, and from theſe tranſient reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutions of an awakened hour, they hoped God would be merciful; but God ſays, their goodneſs or conſideration was as the morning cloud, and as the early dew that paſſeth away. They reſolved to ſerve God, only when they feared his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and were forced to conſideration, by ſome melancholy ſpectacle of the danger of ſin, as we are at the preſent moment. God hewed them by his prophets—He warned them by the miniſters of religion, of the end to which they muſt come without repentance;—He flew them by the words of his mouth,—by his law and threatnings, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced the certain conſequences of forgetting him and his commandments. Becauſe judgment againſt their evil works was not inſtantly executed, they determined God to be like themſelves, and hoped there was no evil to come. To teach them there was an evil to come, his judgments were as a light that ſhineth. The judgments of God in
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032888_0005_0FF5C6D5E66E5D18"/>
this world are moſt wonderfully appointed. The ſtate of probation in which men are placed, forbids the full execution of juſtice upon them.—This would be inconſiſtent with ſuch uſe of means as are appointed unto repentance; ſtill if there were no judgments they would wholly forget God. He therefore appoints his judgments in wonderful wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, ſo as not to prevent a ſtate of trial, and at the ſame time remind us that the wages of ſin are death. There are ſo many of God's judgments on ſin, that if our hearts are ſet to do evil becauſe the full puniſhment is not ſpeedily executed, the conduct is moſt unreaſonable. His judgments are as a light that goeth forth, confirming the ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of his law, that the wages of ſin are death. They have been ſo from the beginning, and are before our eyes on this ſolemn occaſion.</p>
            <p>IN further deſcribing thoſe whom God reproved, he ſays, they like men tranſgreſſed the covenant, and dealt treacherouſly againſt him.—A ſinful life, in the greateſt part of thoſe who indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, may fitly be called treachery. In ſome ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſenſe, they profeſs to believe he is God, and promiſe to obey him; but where the heart is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedient, and his character and law are not rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erenced and loved, the whole is a treacherous pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion; and if thoſe who make it, are ever brought to ſee God and themſelves truly, they will be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible it is the caſe.</p>
            <p>THE character drawn in the context applies to a great variety of perſons. To thoſe who againſt knowledge live in the vicious indulgence of their
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032888_0006_0FF5C6DF19B1CA10"/>
paſſions and appetites:—Who having ſufficient ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence there is a God, go thro' days and years in forgetfulneſs of him, in impiety, profaneneſs, think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing only of time, the world and preſent amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments:—To thoſe who do not realize their obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to live for the glory of their maker:—To thoſe, whoſe minds are ſo much taken up with preſent things, as to forget they are ſoon to die and come into judgment:—To thoſe who live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out prayer and in neglect of the inſtitution of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; and to all who have not a ſupreme love of God, his law and government.—The great defect of all ſuch perſons, is, they have not that holineſs, mercy and knowledge of God in their hearts and practice, in which true obedience conſiſts. Being deſtitute of a true love of God, and carnal and ſelfiſh in their whole diſpoſition, and unfeeling of moral obligation, it is ſtrange they do not commit more of thoſe crimes that muſt be puniſhed by the hand of civil juſtice.</p>
            <p>A want of love and obedience to God implies a heart capable of any other crime. He who fails in love, and is unjuſt and treacherous to his God is certainly, by the ſame diſpoſition, capable of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and treachery to his fellow-creatures. And when we ſee very many, who give no evidence of a delight in God; it muſt be imputed to ſpecial divine reſpect and care, that we are not much oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ener called to ſuch ſolemn ſcenes as are before us this day.—When we look on an unhappy man whom God hath left to expoſe himſelf to this death, we may fitly realize a diſtinguiſhing goodneſs of God, that we are not in his place.—Though not
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032888_0007_0FF5C6E0BA763B78"/>
under the ſentence of human laws, we are condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the divine law. The goodneſs of the beſt hath been too much like a morning cloud. It is God's providence and not our own natural diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions, which hath preſerved us from puniſhable crimes. There is no ſafety in that evil heart, which deals treacherouſly towards God, by not loving him; and which is deſtitute of an experimental knowledge of his ſanctifying grace. If we are ſanctified by his holy ſpirit, ſovereign grace hath done the work; and if not ſanctified, the only cauſe which preſerves, is that Almighty power, which means to uphold a certain degree of order in the world. The beſt preſervative is mercy and a knowledge of God. Theſe in our text, ſtand oppoſed to ſacrifice and burnt offering. The firſt means a holy conformity to the divine goodneſs, and a ſanctifying knowledge of God and his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments. This is a divine temper of the ſoul, which reſiſts temptation—makes ſin appear hateful—and delights in glorifying God, and doing good to men. The laſt, ſacrifice and burnt offering, as they ſtand oppoſed in the text to mercy and a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the Lord, mean that general or formal or unaffecting belief of God, his law and our own du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; and that inconſtant attention to the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of religion, which are conſiſtent with a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er love of the world and its intereſts, of ourſelves and our own luſts, than we have of God himſelf. In this, there is little efficacy for preſervation.—And all of this character, ought to feel that it is God's care of the world and not their own princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, which keep them from ſudden ruin in time and eternity. In thoſe principles of ſin which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032888_0008_0FF5C6E25897E218"/>
God his right, men can find no ſafety to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; nor can there be any ſafety to the world. Public ſafety in the midſt of ſuch principles, muſt be aſcribed to the controling power of the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty; and when the time comes, either in this or the next world, that the ſhining of his judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is neceſſary for general good, he will leave the ſinner to ſhow himſelf and meet deſerved pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment.</p>
            <p>SECONDLY, I am to make ſuch an improvement of the ſubject, as naturally ariſes from the paſſage that hath been paraphraſed, and from the occaſion of our meeting. And I ſhall do this, Firſt, with reference to the congregation at large. Secondly, in ſpecial application to the unhappy man, who is to go from hence to the place of his execution.</p>
            <p n="1">1. BOTH the ſubject and the occaſion teach how much God is diſpleaſed with us, if we are not ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and ſanctified in our temper and practice. If we have not that true knowledge of God, which implies pure affections of the heart, our ſtate is full of danger, both for time and eternity. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon mercies and bounties of providence, are no evidence God is pleaſed with us, for theſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows both on the good and the evil, the juſt and the unjuſt. How many ungrateful men he feeds and cloaths. To how many vicious men doth he grant the common preſervation of life, even pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving them for a ſeaſon, from the deſtruction that naturally follows their criminal appetites and paſſions. God doth not this to encourage ſin; but by an exhibition of his forbearance, to draw
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:032888_0009_0FF5C6E3F9CEEB70"/>
them to repentance, and to preſerve the world in ſuch a ſtate of peace, as is the beſt probation for eternity. All who have not a true knowledge of God, are under his diſpleaſure. He doth not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve becauſe he is pleaſed with them. Their doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trinal knowledge will not avert the final judgment. Their general profeſſion of Chriſtianity will not ſave them. Unleſs their hearts be changed the time will ſoon come, either in this or another world, when the judgment of God will go forth againſt them, to ſhow his own holineſs, and to make his own kingdom very glorious.</p>
            <p n="2">2dly. WE ought to conſider the danger to our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that is inbred with the principles of ſin and a departure from God. Sin cannot be made a ſafe thing. The ingredients of a hell, both preſent and future, are in its very nature. Why are not the ſinners of this world perfectly miſerable beings at this moment? Not becauſe their principles do not lead to it; but God to anſwer his infinitely wiſe purpoſes, holds them from it. Sin admits no hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in the enjoyment of God, nor in a view of his law and government. It deſtroys peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and that inward harmony, which makes exiſtence bleſſed. It counteracts all ſocial felicity, turning men's hands and hearts againſt one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. While a ſinful creature dreads God as his Judge, he ought to dread himſelf as the immediate inſtrument of his own wretchedneſs. He carries in his own boſom the cauſe and means of his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs, and there can be no ſafety to him in his own principles. Inſtead of thinking hard of God, for thoſe evils which his ſins bring upon him,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:032888_0010_0FF5C6EC78D77BB0"/>
he ought to adore that preſerving goodneſs, which hath hitherto kept him from utter ruin.</p>
            <p n="3">3dly. THIS occaſion is a ſolemn inſtruction, not only in the dangerous nature of ſinful principles in general, but of ſeveral particular kinds of ſin, which are very prevalent among mankind. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperance is a ſinful habit, which ruins a great number of mankind, and leads them to ſuch high crimes as are capitally puniſhed by the laws of men. I am charged by my own conſcience, and deſired by the unhappy man who ſuffers this day, on the preſent occaſion to ſpeak freely of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of this ſin. Though this man hath hitherto denied any prepenſe, malicious intention of mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, he ſpeaks in moſt feeling terms of the danger of ſin, of forgetting God, and of an unchaſte, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate life. He traces back moſt of his unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in life, and eſpecially this awful ſcene, to impure connexions and to intemperance. The ſin of drunkenneſs hath been a principal means of bringing him to this caſe. And he is only one of many thouſands of mankind, who have come to the ſame end by the ſame means. A mind intox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icated with liquor, is prepared to mingle with the moſt impure and abandoned companions, and to commit any violence. Almoſt every violence that takes place in civiliſed ſociety, and family unhappi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs may be traced to intemperance as their cauſe. How many rational creatures it turns into beaſts of prey! how many families it cloaths with rags and deprives of bread! how often it diſturbs the otherwiſe peaceful neighbourhood! how many it brings to death by the hand of public juſtice! how
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:032888_0011_0FF5C6EE14767AC8"/>
many ſouls it ruins for both worlds!—Thoſe, who give themſelves up to this ſin, raſhly defy all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible miſery. This prevailing vice, is greatly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by tipling houſes and dram ſhops, where the incautious gradually acquire a habit which proves their ruin. Every ſuch place is a deep e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil in ſociety, and a nurſery for murder and eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ruin. I do not know any way in which the civil authority can make themſelves more worthy of reſpect, or do greater good to the public, who are placed under their care, than by a faithful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of our good laws, againſt ſuch places and againſt thoſe perſons who give themſelves up to intemperance. If any think I ſpeak too freely on this ſubject, as my vindication, I beg them to look to that ſpectacle now in our eyes.—Look to yon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der place of execution, around which we ſhall ſoon be gathered, to behold the moſt awful of all ſights. And let us remember that this event is as a light which ſhineth, teaching us the preſent nature of ſin, and the more awful judgments of God on ſuch as live and die unreformed.</p>
            <p>I am in the laſt place to apply myſelf to the man who is ſoon to die.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>My unhappy Fellow-Creature,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I call you unhappy in the ſight of men, as one whom the holy providence of God appoints to an ignominious death. There is, nevertheleſs, room for you to be eternally happy in the world to which you are ſoon going. It is the glory of the goſpel, that it proclaims ſalvation to the chief of repenting ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, thro' Jeſus Chriſt. If you have repented of
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:032888_0012_0FF5C6F03063E8B0"/>
all your ſins, you may go by this death to which you are appointed, to a heaven of glorious and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal happineſs. If you have truly repented, the riches of divine grace in Jeſus Chriſt and the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of divine love will be glorified in plucking you as a brand out of the burning, from that vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, inconſiderate and prayerleſs life, in which you acknowledge you have generally lived. If you have truly repented, you will thank God forever, even for theſe ſevere means of ſaving you from your ſin. But remember that it is a hard queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for men to determine, whether they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented, and you have only an hour or two more to examine. I am ſenſible that you proſeſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve moſt of thoſe doctrines, which Chriſtians ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally receive; and alſo to hope that you have been forgiven by God, thro' a true repentance and faith. But as your eternal happineſs is depending, you cannot review this matter too cloſely in the few moments you have left. Pray, pray earneſtly to God, that he would enlighten, while I make ſome remarks for your aſſiſtance. The infinite goodneſs of God is an acknowledged truth; but this is no certain evidence you are going to happineſs, for his goodneſs may require him to puniſh you in another world as he doth in this.—Your doctrinal knowledge will not ſave; for the heart is often ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry bad, where the underſtanding is well indoctrin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated.—Your own righteouſneſs will not ſave you; for certainly, you have nothing of your own, but a life of ſin to preſent before your Judge,—viſible ſins, and a heart full of ſin and forgetfulneſs of your maker. It muſt be pure goſpel—pure ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign grace—pure ſanctifying grace, that ſaves you
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032888_0013_0FF5C6F1C53530E0"/>
if you be ſaved. If you feel as though there ever has been, or now is, any thing in you deſerving of God's favor; if you think your cries and prayers form any kind of challenge on God; this would prove you deſtitute of true Chriſtian humility and ſtill unforgiven. Chriſt's promiſes in the goſpel are many and glorious; but you have no right to place any dependence on theſe, of being ever hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py; unleſs your heart hath complied with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions on which they are made. They are made only to a holy repentance, and other gracious af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of the ſame moral nature. Every man will in ſome ſenſe repent, when he meets the bitter fruits of ſinning; but this is more properly called, mourning for the puniſhment than for the ſin.—Hating miſery is no evidence of hating ſin.—Fly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from puniſhment, is no evidence of flying from tranſgreſſion.</p>
            <p>IF your repentance be holy and ſincere, you will mourn for your ſins, more on account of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honor done to God, and his kingdom, than for the ſhame and condemnation it brings on yourſelf.—You will hate it as unreaſonable—as contrary to the moſt ſolemn moral obligation—and baſe in its very nature.</p>
            <p>A holy love, doth not ariſe from an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that God will beſtow great benefits on you perſonally.—To love God, only becauſe we think he loves us, is what every unforgiven, unholy ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner may do. The infinite perfection of God's na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, law and government, is the reaſon for which a true penitent loves him; and if he ſuppoſed that
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032888_0014_0FF5C6F91C7412A8"/>
he ſhould never be forgiven himſelf, he would ſtill ſay the Lord's character is lovely.</p>
            <p>A ſaving faith is a receiving of Chriſt, as glorious in his nature, whole character and offices.—To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on him as a deliverer from puniſhment and not from ſin, is not a gracious exerciſe.—To the true believer, Chriſt's power to ſanctify appears like a moſt excellent part of his mediatorial character.—If you are a goſpel penitent, you will feel a ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble love of God's law, and chooſe it as the rule of your affections, tho' you know it condemns you. You will ſay his providence is right—you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice that he reigns, and have no deſire to take the government from his hands.</p>
            <p>I have plainly expreſſed to you ſome principal Chriſtian exerciſes, by which you are in this ſolemn moment to try yourſelf. A conſciouſneſs that you poſſeſs theſe exerciſes, is the only certain evidence of God's mercy to you, and that you are prepared to die. If you have become a penitent man; tho' conſcious of your own total unworthineſs, it will be a pleaſure to you to pray to God, and to hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble yourſelf before him in the deepeſt expreſſions of ſelf abaſement.—Prayer to God is the moſt uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful manner in which you can ſpend the ſhort re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of your life.—Prayer will bring God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to your view; and the more truly you ſee God, the more truly alſo you will ſee yourſelf, and feel your guilt. Look to him to forgive a ſinner, who deſerves nothing but to be eternally caſt off. Aſk mercy and the forgiveneſs of your ſins, for the ſole ſake of Jeſus Chriſt. If you have any thing in
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032888_0015_0FF5C6FAE850F410"/>
your heart againſt any man, now forgive and pray for him; for he who doth not forgive, ſhall not be forgiven. Feel as though you had no enemies but your own ſins; and realize that none but God can ſanctify you.</p>
            <p>MAY the Lord go with you from this place, and give you a humble fortitude in the event you are to meet; and when your eyes are cloſed in death, may God have mercy on your ſoul. AMEN.</p>

            <head>A SHORT ACCOUNT OF THE LIFE OF RICHARD DOANE, AS GIVEN BY HIMSELF; ALSO OF THE STATE OF HIS MIND DURING THE TIME OF HIS CONFINEMENT, AND AT HIS DEATH.</head>
            <p>THE man who was lately executed by the name of RICHARD DOANE, was ſentenced to death, by the Superior Court in September, 1796, to be executed December 14th.—The General Aſſembly, on his application at their October Seſſion, repriev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him until June 10th, 1797, at which time he was executed for the murder of DANIEL M'IVER.</p>
            <p>HE gave the following account of himſelf:—That he was born in a large city of Great-Britain, in the year 1755, of reputable parents.—That his father was a man of activity and buſineſs; his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, apparently, a woman of piety and much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted to the duties of religion. He was inſtructed
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:032888_0017_0FF5C6FEC59751F8"/>
in the principles of the Chriſtian religion, in his youth, under one of the moſt eminent divines of the day. He ſaid that his connexion in marriage with a virtuous woman, to whom he was attached in affection from his early youth, contrary to the wiſhes of friends, was the cauſe of bringing him to America. That he refuſed more lucrative em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments offered him by his friends, for the ſake of living with the object of his affections. His buſineſs was a ſtone-cutter. He came into the ſouthern part of the United States, where he liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed regularly and induſtriouſly, until the death of his wife and their only child. He repreſented her as a perſon of much virtue and diſcretion, and conſidered her death as the beginning of his real miſfortunes. Her death threw him into a ſtate of great dejection, for a conſiderable time, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qualified him for buſineſs, when he began an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temperate life as a remedy for ſorrow. After ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral years he emerged from the gloom, and would labor induſtriouſly for a number of weeks, and then in a fit of intoxication ſpend his earnings and give himſelf up to profaneneſs and impiety.</p>
            <p>IT doth not appear that he was a malicious man, when free from the influence of ſpiritous liquor; but in his periods of intoxication was often abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, and was under this influence when he put an end to the life of M'Iver. A number of his laſt years were ſpent in various towns of Connecticut and the vicinity of the ſtate. In his laſt confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he ſpoke with great abhorrence of his paſt life. Drunkenneſs, profaneneſs, and a connexion with evil women were the actual crimes of which
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:032888_0018_0FF5C70830ECDF30"/>
he appeared moſt ſenſible. He ſpoke in moſt feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing terms of the dreadful ſtate of thoſe who indulge in theſe vices.—That they not only deſtroy reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and health, and diſqualify for the confidence of mankind; but lead to every other ſin, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voke a Holy God to give up the ſinner to the moſt awful puniſhments, in this and another world.</p>
            <p>MANY reports have circulated concerning ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed crimes committed by this man, which are doubtleſs without foundation. It was common for him in his ſeaſons of intoxication, to be abuſive both in words and actions, as is uſual in drunken people; but there is no evidence that when free from liquor he was malicious or dangerous.</p>
            <p>THE man whom he murdered was one of his friends and companions, and the fatal affray aroſe wholly from intoxication.</p>
            <p>PERHAPS none will queſtion that accidental in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toxication, leſſens the criminality of the violence done in an irrational hour. The caſe is far differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent with wilful and habitual drunkards. Theſe perſons, even if they loſe memory, muſt have been often informed of their own abuſe and violence. They ought to conſider, that taking the bottle is taking the dagger; and though they have not any malice againſt particular individuals, the very act of drinking may be conſidered as malice againſt human nature. In this view Doane in his hours of repentance acknowledged his ſentence to be a juſt one, though he had no enmity againſt the man whoſe life was deſtroyed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:032888_0019_0FF5C709CA9D6458"/>
SUCH inſtances as theſe, warn us, that it is the duty of thoſe who have authority, due both to the public, and to habitual drunkards themſelves, to place them in a ſtate of confinement. Had this man, in due time, received the correction of the work-houſe, it might have ſaved him from the halter.</p>
            <p>THOUGH it be not common for thoſe who have long lived a vicious life to find repentance, God ſometimes grants it to magnify the ſovereignty and greatneſs of his mercy, and teach us to ſeek his favor to the laſt hour.</p>
            <p>IT is hoped, that this man was one of thoſe un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common inſtances of true repentance and grace.—Much pains were taken by neighbouring Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ians, from the beginning of his confinement, to converſe and pray with him. It appeared that he had been early indoctrinated in the principles of Chriſtianity, though many of its truths were much effaced by a long courſe of vice.</p>
            <p>SOON after his condemnation, he appeared deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convinced of guilt in the ſight of God, and the terrors of future miſery hung upon him. He was led to ſee a heart, as well as life, full of ſin and rebellion againſt God; and that he might in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect juſtice be forever caſt off.—After this his mind was ſtrongly affected with a ſenſe of the goodneſs of God, in giving a Saviour for the ſalvation of penitents; and to himſelf in particular, for ſparing him ſo long while he had lived without prayer and in the practice of ſin.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:032888_0020_0FF5C70B5C035B30"/>
HIS hope of his own ſalvation was very gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally formed, and in the laſt part of his life appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be very ſtrong.</p>
            <p>HE uniformly ſpoke of himſelf, as a creature guilty and juſtly condemned, and that nothing but infinite mercy through the blood of Chriſt, could ſave him; and appeared ſtrong in a belief that he did rely on this mercy, and approve the character and law of God.</p>
            <p>THE diſtinction, which men often make between little and great ſins, appeared to him improper; and he often ſaid, that among all his ſins of heart and life, he never had committed one that was ſmall, when conſidered as againſt an infinite God. His conduct was very decent and proper thro' the day of execution. In going to the place of death, he ſaid that he felt himſelf ſtrangely ſtrengthened both in body and mind, and aſcribed all to the goodneſs of God.</p>
            <p>AFTER having on the ſcaffold confeſſed his irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious life, warned the ſpectators againſt thoſe vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces which ruined him, and declared himſelf free from any murderous intentions againſt M'Iver, the ſentence was executed.</p>
            <p>HE committed the names of his connexions in Great-Britain, to the Rev. NATHAN STRONG and Rev. ABEL FLINT, Miniſters of the Preſbyterian Churches in Hartford, to whom any who are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſted in making an inquiry concerning him may apply.</p>
