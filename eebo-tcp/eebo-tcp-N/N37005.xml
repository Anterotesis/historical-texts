            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <hi>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing? are not even ye in the preſence of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his coming?</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THE ſecond coming of Chriſt is a ſource of peculiar joy and conſolation to the people of God: it is a day in which their hopes and expectations will be fully anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Tribulation attends the good man while in this life; the ſcenes of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence are myſterious, and many things un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable and inſignificant without a day of judgment; they will<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> then be explained and adjuſted to the joy and admiration of all who love Chriſt's appearing. Many of the events that take place in this life, ſtand in a ſolemn relation to the judgment day, and none more ſo than the goſpel miniſtry; hence it is that the attention of the true ſervants of Chriſt is ſo much taken up with a future ſtate. St. Paul being detained from the Church of Theſſalonica<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſends this epiſtle as a token of his love and reſpect to them; in which he anticipates that bleſſed period, when he ſhould meet them at the bar of Chriſt, which would afford ſuch joy and ſatisfaction as to more then compenſate for all their ſorrow, more eſpecially for his being prevented a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal inteview with thoſe to whom he wrote. <hi>For what is our hope, or joy, or crown of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joicing? are not even ye in the preſence of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:048467_0003_102515EDF5C6B940"/>
our Lord Jeſus Chriſt at his coming?</hi> We have two very important ideas ſuggeſted in the words. One is, that miniſters and their people muſt meet each other at the day of judgment.—The ſecond is, that although miniſters are often ſeparated from their hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers in this life, yet the people of God among whom a pious preacher finiſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s his work, will be a cauſe or crown of peculiar joy and ſatisfaction at the ſecond coming of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>With reſpect to the firſt point we may obſerve, to give us a ſtriking contraſt between this and the coming world, we are in the preſent ſtate ſubject to many viciſſitudes.</p>
            <p>What changes are taking place in em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pires, ſtates, ſocieties, and families? In noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is this more obſervable than in matters relating to miniſters and the people of their charge. A perſecuting ſpirit, that prevailed in the apoſtolic age, was often a mean of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting friends, and eſpecially of driving preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from churches: the ſame cauſe has had influence in every age of the church; but if religious ſocieties are ſo happy, as to eſcape ſuch a calamity, yet it pleaſes the Great Head of the church in his ſovereign wiſdom, to ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate miniſters and their people by death; this gives feeling to a pious preacher, and in ſome degree has influence in every ſermon he delivers. That all mankind will be collected before the bar of Chriſt, to ſee the great and intricate affairs of the univerſe adjuſted, is a plain dictate of reaſon and ſcripture; but that
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:048467_0004_102515FDC91082C8"/>
many will meet there as having mutual con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns with each other, is evident.—More eſpecially, miniſters and the people once com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to their charge, doubtleſs will appear in ſome ſenſe as diſtinct ſocieties, as having particular and perſonal matters to attend to.—This ſuppoſes that they will have a knowledge of each other: for without this the purpoſes of their meeting in ſuch a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner could not be anſwered. How far this will extend, or by what means it will be conveyed, is too curious to enquire. It ſeems, unleſs we are able by ſome means to diſtinguiſh thoſe from others with whom we have been intimate in this life, the deſigns of a future judgment will in ſome meaſure be fruſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated. The great end of that day is to illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate divine truth, or make that appear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous to created intelligence; to effect this, God will make uſe of mankind as inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; this is the method he takes in this life, and doubtleſs it will be moſt eligible in the world to come. For our acquaintance to be ſummoned as witneſſes for or gainſt us at this court, will perhaps be the beſt means to adminiſter conviction. In this way the great God can ſpeak in language eaſy for finite creatures to underſtand. One deſign of the world, being divided into diſtinct ſocieties and communities, is doubtleſs to prepare matters for the day of judgment. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between miniſters and people is ſuch as <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>enders them capable of ſaying much a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout each other; in this way the juſtice and mercy of God will be illuſtrated, divine pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:048467_0005_1025160AAB9B5C50"/>
vindicated, and every mouth ſtop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped. It is our conduct in this life that will direct divine proceeding towards us at the fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal judgment; that the equity of God's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations may appear, 'tis neceſſary that our characters be clearly inveſtigated. The ſalvation and damnation of many ſouls will be through the inſtrumentality of faithful and unfaithful watchmen: this is an idea contained in the charge God gave to Ezeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el, 32d Chapter. It will be neceſſary that the motives by which miniſters have been influenced in their work, be brought out to view: for without ſincerity of heart they can never execute their office with any degree of true faithfulneſs, and are an high affront to God, and a vile impoſition on the people.</p>
            <p>At the day of judgment the <hi>doctrines</hi> with which a miniſter has entertained his hearers muſt be examined. However, doctrinal preaching may be diſcarded by many and ſuch words as <hi>metaphyſical abſtruſe,</hi> &amp;c. are of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten made uſe of to obſtruct free and candid enquiry. Yet it is evident that one great end of the goſpel miniſtry is to diſſeminate right ſentiments; hence it is that Paul ſo of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten exhorts Timothy to take heed to his <hi>doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine.</hi> Sound doctrine, as well as good prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is neceſſary to conſtitute the chriſtian character; whoſoever tranſgreſſeth and abid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not in the <hi>doctrine</hi> of Chriſt hath not God, 2 John, 9.</p>
            <p>A careful inquiry will be made whether an

               </gap>, &amp;c. have been the main things with which a people have been entertained; tending on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to gratify vain curioſity, and to fix the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention of the hearers on the Speaker. This made St. Paul contemn ſuch a mode of preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and determine not to know any thing ſave Jeſus Chriſt, and him cruſified, 1. Cor. 2. 2. Whether vague equivocal expreſſions have been uſed to convey, or rather to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure the truths of the goſpel; by which any thing, and almoſt every thing may be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. This is cauſing the trumpet to give an uncertain found; &amp; has no tendency to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, or give feeling to the mind, as is the caſe with the words of the wiſe, being as <hi>goads</hi> and <hi>nails,</hi> Eccle. 12. 11.—Whether to pleaſe men has had greater influence in our compoſing and deliver our ſermons and the glory of God and the good of ſouls. People will be examined at the bar of Chriſt, wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er they have not been dealt plainly with—Been told their characters and danger—That they are wholly oppoſed to God, deſtitute of every thing that is holy, or morally good.—That they are by nature under the curſe of God's law, expoſed every moment to endleſs woe—That they are hopeleſs and helpleſs in themſelves—The neceſſity of the renewing influences of the ſpirit—The nature of their imputency, that it conſiſts in an evil heart; that therefore they are altogether inexcuſable, and are criminal in proportion to the degree of their inability—That nothing ſhort of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance towards God, and faith in the Lord
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:048467_0007_1025163478A98610"/>
Jeſus Chriſt, is the immediate duty of all that hear the goſpel.</p>
            <p>Miniſters and their people muſt meet be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Judgment Seat of Chriſt to give an account whether the true character of God has in any good meaſure been inveſtigated—As a ſin hating and ſin revenging God—As one who in his ſovereign wiſdom and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs has elected ſome to everlaſting life, and others for the diſplay of his power and juſtice to eternal death—That he governs all things by a fixed unalterable plan. That of him, and to him, and through him are all things.</p>
            <p>Without this, the character of God is kept out of ſight, people left in the dark, and ar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> not able to determine whether they love or hate the true God.</p>
            <p>It muſt be known whether people have had the character and work of the Redeemer ſet before then—The deſign of his ſufferings; the efficacy of his blood, and the neceſſity of our union to him. The manner in which divine truth has been delivered, will be a matter worthy of ſerious examination at that day; Whether with that earneſtneſs &amp; ſervor, becoming the vaſt importance and ſo-ſolemnity of goſpel truth, tending to effect the mind. The deportment, or examples of miniſters among their people will be cloſely attended to: their private viſits, exhortations and reproofs, holy deſires and wreſtlings for the ſouls of their hearers, will not eſcape
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:048467_0008_10251646C4B8ADE0"/>
public notice; the improvement that people have made of ſuch advantages will be bro't into public view.</p>
            <p>How often people have attended on the miniſtration of the word, and the manner how, will he matters of ſerious concern at the judgment day. Thoſe excuſes that men make for neglecting public worſhip, will be weighed in a juſt ſcale. Whether people have ſo far contributed to the temporal ſupport of their miniſters as to enable them to devote themſelves to the ſervice of Chriſt: or by too great neglect, have not obſtructed the goſpel, robbed God, wounded their own ſouls.</p>
            <p>It will be uſeful that the <hi>time</hi> of a miniſters continuance among a people be known, as it will ſerve to ſet the characters of goſpel deſpiſers in a true point of light. That min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſters and the people of their charge will meet each other at the bar of Chriſt is ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted in my text, and in other parts of the ſacred writings.—It has already been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that in this way truth will appear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, and the conduct of God will be vindicated, and the deſigns of a judgment-day in the beſt manner anſwered. It may further be obſerved, that the matters relating to the goſpel miniſtry are of ſuch magnitude that it appears important that they be attended to; they concern a judgment day, and an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal ſtate. When miniſters and people meet in the houſe of God it is an acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edgment
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:048467_0009_1025168C0B8C3128"/>
that they believe in a future ſtate of retribution, and is a ſort of appeal to the day of judgment. The influence of a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, or unfaithful minſter is ſuch as to effect unborn ages; it will commonly determine the ſentiments and characters of their ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors; and in this way they may be doing good or evil after they are dead and even to the ſecond coming of Chriſt. That God's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred towards falſe teachers, and againſt thoſe who chooſe them, together with their crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality may appear, it will be neceſſary that theſe matters are laid open at the tribunal of Chriſt.—As a proof of the matter under conſideration I may only add: That there al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways has been an important controverſy in a greater or leſs degree between miniſters and part of their people; it is ſo with faithful preachers and ſome of their hearers; wicked men oppoſe the doctrines they preach, and will not be convinced. Unfaithful preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, they have advocates and oppoſers; the diſpute involved the character of Chriſt, it cannot be ſettled in this world: how neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that miniſters and people meet at the great day, to have the matter decided, the doctrines of Chriſt vindicated, and the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acters of miniſters or people exonerated?</p>
            <p>II. Another important idea contained in the text is, That the church, or people of God, among whom a faithful miniſter finiſhes his work, will be a cauſe, or crown of pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar joy or rejoicing at the coming of Chriſt.

down with Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, and other ſaints at that day; but the ſcriptures repreſent that godly miniſters will derive peculiar joy from the pious part of their congregations. Dan. 12. 3, 2. Cor. 1. 14. Phil. 2. 16. Reflecting on paſt providences, will be a ſource of great joy at the day of judgment: and as many things have taken place between a miniſter and his people in which they are more particularly converſant and intereſted, when they come to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, it will afford ſpecial joy and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they have been companions in tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, ſo now it is likely they will be in a more peculiar ſenſe co-partners in joy, and help each other in magnifying the Lord for ſpecial favors, and diſplays of divine power and grace on their behalf.</p>
            <p>The prayers &amp; ſtruggles of pious teachers have been for Zion in general, and for thoſe over whom the Holy Ghoſt has made them over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeers in particular: Now God will give their hearers who have been converted through their inſtrumentality as a kind of reward and fruit of their travel or labor.

"Well done good and faithful ſervant! Their mutual accounts will be given up with joy, and not with grief, Hebrews 13. 17.

            <p>That it will be poſſible to hold equal communion with all the ſaints, eſpecially at one time in the inviſible world, perhaps is not admiſſible. It appears that the wicked, who have been aſſociates in ſin here, will be companions of torments hereafter, Luke 16. 28.</p>

They help them in their work, 2. Cor. 1. 11. God will in the great day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward people for ſuch kindneſs; as hereby they expreſs their love to Chriſt, Mat. 25. 40. This will gratify the benevolent feelings of Chriſt's ſervants; at the ſame time fill them with holy admiration, and deep humility, that what has been done to ſuch poor ſinful creatures ſhould be taken notice of.</p>
            <p>Miniſters and the people of their charge will aſſiſt each other, and be united in bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a verdict againſt the wicked and impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, among whom they lived while on earth. The ſaints are to judge the world, 1. Cor. 6. 2.

               <p n="1">1. WE may infer from this ſubject, that the goſpel miniſtry is of God, and that we ought to ſeek its welfare, and uſe ſuitable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions for its ſupport.</p>
               <p>Does ſcripture and reaſon dictate that it is of ſo much importance, eſpecially as it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates to a judgment day, we may con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude that God would not do without it, and we may ſee divine wiſdom and goodneſs in the inſtitution. Nothing more conducive of divine glory, and ſalutary to men, than the preaching of the goſpel.—Without theſe glad tidings are proclaimed, the Incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Chriſt is vain. Nothing but oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to God, and diſregard to his glory, will make them indifferent to the preaching of the goſpel. A rejection of Chriſt and his miniſters, have commonly vice, and open prophanity, for their inſeparable companions. The oppoſition that the impenitent part of

               <p>We may conclude that ſince the goſpel miniſtry is ſo very uſeful, that it will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to the end of the world.</p>

But few ways perhaps that God ſhews greater diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure againſt a people than in calling his am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſſadors home. By this he threatens to put an end to his treaty of peace, and become irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concilable. It may ſometimes be the caſe that God has no more choſen or elect ones among them. When Paul and Barrabas were preaching at Antioch, as many as were <hi>ordained</hi> to eternal life, believed, then they departed, Acts 13. All the encouragement for a miniſter to preach among a people, ſo far as the ſalvation of ſouls ought to be a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, is the doctrine of election. After the death of a faithful miniſter there is leſs hope of a people.</p>
               <p>We may further obſerve, when it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered, that we are to meet them no more in the houſe of God, to hear them declare unto us the words of reconciliation; but our next interview will be at the tribunal of Chriſt, to hear them teſtify, for or againſt us, how affecting the conſideration!

            <head>MEMOIRS OF THE LIFE OF THE REV. ABRAHAM CARPENTER.</head>
            <p>HE was born on the 23d of Sept. 1739<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at Rehoboth, Maſſachuſetts: was ſon of Mr. Abiel Carpenter of that place; who was a man of piety and induſtry; by which means his family received a religious education<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the fruit of which was conſpicuous in his children, eſpecially in his ſon, the ſubject of theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moirs, who dates his converſion in the 23d year of his age, when he became a member of the church under the paſtoral care of the Rev. Mr. Rogerſon. He was married to Miss Elizabeth Bliſs, daughter of Mr. John Bliſs of Rehoboth, in his 21ſt year. They had ten children, four ſons and ſix daughters; their mother and ſix children only ſurvive.</p>
            <p>In his 24th year he moved to Killingſly, in Connecticut, where he reſided eight years, and commenced a preacher of the goſpel.—Soon after he removed to Plainfield, N. Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, where he had a call to ſettle in the work of the goſpel miniſtry, which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted; and continued paſtor of a church there for 15 years, and was much eſteemed by his people and acquaintance.</p>
            <p>Some diviſions ariſing in the town reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a place to build a Meeting Houſe, to<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>gether

with a great depreciation of numbers in the church, an eccleſiaſtical council was called, and for the reaſons above, thought it expedient to diſmiſs him from his paſtoral relation to that people.</p>
            <p>The church at the ſame time cordially u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited in <q>Recommending him, as one who had approved himſelf able and faithful in his work, during the time of his having exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed the paſtoral care of the church among them.</q> The council at the ſame time con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred with the church in recommending their paſtor, ſo far as their acquaintance would admit. This appears from a reſult of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil left among Mr. Carpenter's papers. He removed to Rutland, State of Vermont, March 13 1789, and was again ſettled in the work of the miniſty, and diſcharged the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to which he was called, to the great ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfaction of his people, and gained the love and eſteem of all who knew him. But few give greater evidence of this love to Chriſt and the ſouls of men, than Mr. Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penter, both in his public miniſtry, and private deportment. He always diſcovered that ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity and chearfulneſs, mixed with chriſtian ſobriety, as endeared him to all his acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, to th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

His health evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently began to decline ſeveral months before his death, which at times impeded his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic miniſtry—Love to his divine maſter and to the ſouls of men, often urged him on be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his ſtrength. For ſome weeks before
