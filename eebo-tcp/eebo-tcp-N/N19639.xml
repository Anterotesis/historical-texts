            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <salute>HAIL, YE HAPPY PEOPLE, HIGHLY FAVOURED OF THE LORD!</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>TO you the following treatiſe on the Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium is dedicated, as you will live in that happy era, and enjoy the good of it in a much higher degree, than it can be now enjoyed in the proſpect of it. And that you may know, if this book ſhall be conveyed down to your time, what is now thought of you, and of the happy day, in which you will come on the ſtage of life. You will be able to ſee the miſtakes which are now made on this head; and how far what is advanced here, is agreeable to that which is noted in the ſcripture of truth, and a true and proper deſcription of the events which are to take place; and to rectify every miſtake. All is therefore humbly ſubmitted to your better judgment.</p>
            <p>When you ſhall learn what a variety of errors, in doctrine and practice, have been, and are now imbibed and propagated; and in what an imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect and defective manner they are oppoſed and confuted; and the truth explained and defended: And obſerve how many defects and miſtakes there are in thoſe writings which contain moſt truth, and come neareſt to the ſtandard of all religious truth, the holy ſcripture, you will be ready to wonder how all this could be, where divine revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is enjoyed. But your benevolence and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour, will make all proper allowances, for all the
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:025635_0003_0FCEAC0A005A4948"/>prejudices and darkneſs which take place in theſe days, and pity us; while your piety will lead you to aſcribe the greater light and advantages which you will enjoy, and your better diſcerning and judgment, not unto yourſelves, but to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhing, ſovereign grace of God.</p>
            <p>Though you have yet no exiſtence, nevertheleſs, the faith of the chriſtians in this and in former ages, beholds you "at hand to come;" and real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izing your future exiſtence and character, you are greatly eſteemed and loved; and the pious have great joy in you, while they are conſtantly, and with great earneſtneſs praying for you. They who make mention of the Lord, will not keep ſilence, nor give him any reſt, till he eſtabliſh, and till he make Jeruſalem a praiſe in the earth. For you they are praying and labouring, and to you they are min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtring; and without you they cannot be made per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. And you will enter into their labours, and reap the happy fruit of their prayers, toils and ſufferings.</p>
            <p>They will be in heaven, with the holy angels and the ſpririts of the juſt made perfect, when you will come upon the ſtage in this world; and they will rejoice in you, in your knowledge, benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, piety, righteouſneſs and happineſs: And all their paſt prayers for you will be turned into joy and praiſe. And you will, in due time, be gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed together with them unto the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in his eternal kingdom, and join in ſeeing and praiſing him forever, aſcribing bleſſing, and honour, and glory, and power, unto the only true God, the Father, Son, and Holy Ghoſt. Amen.</p>

               <p>A PARTICULAR hiſtory of the church of Chriſt, from the days of the Apoſtles, to this time; of the various changes through which it has paſt; of the doctrines which have been taught and maintained; of the diſcipline, worſhip, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, which have taken place; of the grand apoſtacy in the church of Rome, and of the reformation, &amp;c. might be prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erly ſubjoined to the foregoing ſyſtem, were it not that this has been done by a number of writers already; ſo that all who are diſpoſed to acquaint themſelves with eccleſiaſtical hiſtory, may obtain this information by books already extant; Which, at the ſame time, ſerve to confirm the truth and divine original of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, by diſcovering, in how many inſtances the ſtate of the church, and the events which have had a particular reſpect to it, have been foretold, and have taken place according to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions. This ſubject has been particularly illuſtrated by Mr. Lowman, in his "Paraphraſe and Notes on the Revelation of St. John." And ſince, more largely, by Biſhop Newton, in his "Diſſertation on the Prophecies, which have remarkably been fulfilled, and at this time are fulfilling in the world."</p>
               <p>A treatiſe on the Millennium, however, and of the future ſtate of the church of Chriſt, from this time to the end of the world, as it is predicted and deſcribed in divine revelation, is thought
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:025635_0005_0FCEAC0D52DC1448"/>proper and important, not only as it has been more than once re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to in the preceding work; but as it appears not to be believed by many; and not to be well underſtood by more; or attended to by moſt, as an important event; full of inſtruction; ſuited to ſupport, comfort and encourage chriſtians, in the preſent dark appearance of things, reſpecting the intereſt of Chriſt, and his church; and to animate them to faith, patience and perſever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance in obedience to Chriſt; putting on the hope of ſalvation for an helmet. And to excite them more earneſtly to pray for the advancement and coming of the kingdom of Chriſt: Of which kingdom, as it is to take place in this world, or of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity itſelf, there cannot be ſo clear, full and pleaſing an idea, if the ſcripture doctrine of the Millennium be kept out of view.</p>
               <p>In the firſt three centuries after the Apoſties, the doctrine of the Millennium was believed and taught; but ſo many unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy and abſurd things were by ſome advanced concerning it, that it afterwards fell into diſcredit, and was oppoſed, or paſted over in ſilence, by moſt, until the reformation from popery. And then a number of enthuſiaſts advanced ſo many unſcriptural and ridiculous notions concerning it, and made ſuch a bad improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it, that many, if not moſt of the orthodox, in oppoſing them, were led to diſbelieve and oppoſe the doctrine in general; or to ſay little or nothing in favour of the doctrine, in any ſenſe or view of it.</p>
               <p>But few of the moſt noted writers of the laſt century in Britain, or in other parts of the proteſtant world, have ſaid any-thing to eſtabliſh or explain this doctrine: And they who have mentioned it, do appear, at leaſt the moſt of them, not to have well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it. In the preſent century, there has been more attention to it; and the ſcriptures which relate to it, have been more care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully conſidered, and explained by a number of writers; and it has been ſet in a more rational, ſcriptural and important light, than before. Dr. Whitby, has written a treatiſe on the Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium. And Mr. Robertſon, and Mr. Lowman, have aſſerted and explained it in ſome meaſure, in their expoſition of the book of the revelation by the Apoſtle John; eſpecially the beginning of the twentieth chapter of that book. And the late Preſident Edwards, attended much to this ſubject, and wrote upon it more than any other divine in this century. In the year 1747, he publiſhed a book, entitled "An humble attempt to promote ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:025635_0006_0FCEAC0E81849878"/>agreement, and viſible union of God's people, in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary prayer for the revival of religion, and the advancement of Chriſt's kingdom on earth, purſuant to ſcripture promiſes and prophecies concerning the laſt time." In which he produces the evidence from ſcripture, that ſuch a day is yet to come. And in a poſthumous publication of his, intitled "A hiſtory of the work of Redemption," this ſubject is brought into view, and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly conſidered. There is alſo extant, a ſermon on the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium, by the late Dr. Bellamy. And other writers have occaſionally mentioned it. And this ſubject appears to be brought more particularly into view in the public prayers and preaching, and in converſation, in this age, than in former times; and the doctrine of the Millennium is more generally believed, and better underſtood.</p>
               <p>This is rather an encouragement to attempt farther to explain and illuſtrate, this important, pleaſing, uſeful ſubject, in which eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry chriſtian is ſo much intereſted, than a reaſon why nothing more ſhould be ſaid upon it. The ſubject is far from being exhauſted; and as the church advances nearer to the Millennium ſtate, we have reaſon to think the predictions in divine revelation reſpecting it, will be better underſtood; and the minds of chriſtians will be more excited to great attention to this ſubject, and ſtrong deſires to look into thoſe things, and to earneſt longings and prayers for the coming of the kingdom of Chriſt, as it will take place in that day. And all this is to be effected, by means and proper at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts and exertions. "Many ſhall run to and fro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge ſhall be increaſed."</p>
               <p>The prophecies of events which are yet to take place, cannot be ſo fully underſtood before theſe events come to paſs, as they will be when they are fulfilled; and there is great danger of making miſtakes about them. And it is certain, that many have made miſtakes, ſince they have made very different and oppoſite con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiructions of the ſame predictions; and therefore all cannot be right. So far as the prophecies which reſpect the Millennium, of which there are many, can be underſtood, and the real mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them be made plain, by a careful and diligent attention to them, and comparing them with each other, men may go on ſafe ground, and be certain of their accompliſhment. And whatever is a plain and undeniable conſequence, from what is expreſsly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, is equally revealed in the prediction, as an event, or cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:025635_0007_0FCEAC10E2D54838"/>of an event, neceſſarily included in it. But every opinion reſpecting future events, which is matter of conjecture on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, however probable it may be in the view of him who propoſes it, ought to be entertained with modeſty and diffidence.</p>
               <p>The following treatiſe on the Millennium, is not deſigned ſo much to advance any new ſentiments concerning it, which have never before been offered to the public, as to revive and repeat thoſe which have been already ſuggeſted by ſome au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors, which are thought to be very important, and ought to be underſtood, and kept conſtantly in the view of all, in order to their having a proper conception of the church of Chriſt in this world, and reading the ſcriptures to their beſt advantage, and greateſt comfort: Though perhaps ſomething will be advanced, reſpecting the events which, according to ſcripture, are to take place between the preſent time, and the introduction of the happy ſtate of the church, which have not been before ſo particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered.</p>

                  <hi>SECTION I.</hi> In which it is proved from Scripture, that the church of Chriſt is to come to a ſtate of proſperity in this world, which it has never yet enjoyed; in which it will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue at leaſt a thouſand years.</head>
               <p>THE firſt revelation of a Redeemer, in the prediction ſpoken to the ſerpent, may be conſidered as implying the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the kingdom of the devil in this world, by the wiſdom and energy of Chriſt. "He ſhall bruiſe thy head, and thou ſhalt bruiſe his heal."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. iii. 18.</note> Satan has bruiſed the heal of Chriſt, in the ſufferings and diſhonour he has been inſtrumental of bringing upon him, and in the oppoſition he has made to the intereſt and church of Chriſt, in this world. And it is natural to ſuppoſe, that Chriſt ſhall bruiſe his head in this world, by deſtroying his intereſt and kingdom among men, and gaining a conqueſt over him, in the ſtruggle and war which has taken place between the Redeemer and ſeducer of men. And by the Redeemer's <hi>bruiſing the head</hi> of the ſerpent, is ſignified that he will not deſtroy him by the mere exertion of his power, but that by his ſuperiour wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, he will confound and defeat ſatan, in all his ſubtilty and cunning, on which he depends ſo much, and by which he aims to diſappoint Chriſt, and defeat him in his deſigns. And by this he will make a glorious diſplay of his wiſdom, as well as of his power, while he diſcovers the craſtineſs of ſatan to be fooliſhneſs, and diſappoints him in his devices, carrying all the counſel of this cunning froward enemy headlong. If all this could not be gathered from this paſſage, conſidered by itſelf; yet that this is the real meaning, will perhaps appear, from what has already taken place in accompliſhing this prediction; and from other prophecies reſpecting this, ſome of which are to be brought into view in the ſequel: Without which the full meaning of this firſt promiſe could not be known.</p>

In order to bruiſe the head of the ſerpent, in this ſenſe, moſt effectually; and turn his boaſted wiſdom and cunning into fool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhneſs, and entirely defeat him in this way, he muſt have oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity and advantage to try his ſkill and power, and practiſe all his cunning, in oppoſing Chriſt, and the ſalvation of men. And in this way be overcome and wholly defeated, in the ruin of his intereſt and kingdom among men; ſo that all his attempts ſhall turn againſt himſelf, and be the occaſion of making the victory and triumph of the Redeemer greater, more perſpicuous and glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, in the final prevalence of his kingdom on earth, by drawing all men to him; and deſtroying the works and kingdom of ſatan in this world, and ſetting up his own on the ruins of it, and ſo as to turn all the attempts and works of the devil againſt him, and render the whole ſubſervient to his own intereſt and kingdom. And thus the coming and kingdom of Chriſt will be, "As the light of the morning, when the ſun riſeth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender graſs ſpringing out of the earth by clear ſhining after rain." When the ſun riſes in a clear morning, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter a dark night, attended with clouds, rain and ſtorms, the morning is more pleaſant, beautiful and glorious, and the graſs ſprings and grows more freſh and thrifty, than if it had not been preceded by ſuch a ſtormy night. So the proſperity and glory of the church, when the ſun of righteouſneſs ſhall riſe upon it, with healing in his beams, will be enjoyed to a higher degree, and be more pleaſant and glorious, and Chriſt will be more glorified, than if it had not been preceded by a dreadful night of darkneſs, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and evil, by the wickedneſs of men, and the power and agency of ſatan.</p>
               <p>The words above cited, are the laſt words of David the Proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et, and ſweet Pſalmiſt of Iſrael, and are a prophecy of the glorious event now under conſideration. "The Spirit of the Lord ſpake by me, and his word was in my tongue. The God of Iſrael ſaid, the Rock of Iſrael ſpake by me. He that ruleth over men muſt be juſt, ruling in the fear of God. And he ſhall be like the morning, when the ſun riſeth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender graſs ſpringing out of the earth, by clear ſhining after rain."

This is evidently a prophecy concerning Chriſt, his church and kingdom, when he ſhall take to himſelf his great power, and reign in his kingdom, which ſhall ſucceed the reign of ſatan during the four preceding monarchies, which were firſt to take place, which will be more particularly explained, as we proceed in examining the prophecies of this great event, <hi>The latter day glory.</hi> And that theſe words of David, are a prediction of the reign of Chriſt on earth, after the long prevalence of ſatan and wicked men, is farther evident from the words which follow, relative to the ſame thing. "But the ſons of Belial ſhall <hi>all of them</hi> as thorns be thurſt away, becauſe they cannot be taken with hands. But the man that ſhall touch them, muſt be fenced with iron, and the ſtaff of a ſpear, and they ſhall be utterly burnt with fire in the ſame place."</p>
               <p>Exactly parallel with this prophecy, is that of the Prophet Mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chi. "Behold, the day cometh, that ſhall burn as an oven, and all the proud, yea, all that do wickedly, ſhall be ſtubble, and the day that cometh ſhall burn them up, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, that it ſhall leave them neither root nor branch. But unto you that fear my name, ſhall the ſun of righteouſneſs ariſe with healing in his wings; and ye ſhall go forth and grow up as the calves in the ſtall.

               <p>But to return from this, which may ſeem to be ſome digreſſion, or anticipation: The great and remarkable promiſe, ſo often made to Abraham, Iſaac and Jacob, and more than once mentioned by the Apoſtles, will next be conſidered.

                  </gap> number of other prophecies, ſome of which will be mentioned in this ſection.</p>
               <p>The reign of Chriſt on earth, with his church and people, and the happineſs and glory of that time, is a ſubject often mentioned, predicted and celebrated in the book of Pſalms. To mention all that is there ſpoken with reference to that happy time, would be to tranſcribe great part of that book. Only the following paſſages will now be mentioned, which are thought abundantly to prove that the kingdom of Chriſt is to prevail and flouriſh in this world, as it has never yet done; and the church is to be brought to a ſtate of purity, proſperity and happineſs on earth, which has not yet taken place, and ſo as to include all nations, and fill the world.</p>
               <p>In the ſecond Pſalm, it is predicted and promiſed, that the Son of God ſhall inherit and poſſeſs all nations, to the ends of the earth; which neceſſarily implies, that his church and kingdom
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:025635_0012_0FCEAC190082D048"/>ſhall be thus extenſive, reaching to the ends of the earth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding all the nations and men on earth. "I have ſet my king upon my holy hill of Zion. I will declare the decree: The Lord hath ſaid unto me, Thou art my Son, this day have I begotten thee. Aſk of me, and I ſhall give thee the heathen for thine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and the uttermoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion." By Zion here is meant, as in numerous other places in the proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecies, the church of Chriſt, of which Mount Zion was a type.</p>
               <p>The twenty ſecond Pſalm contains a prophecy of the ſufferings of Chriſt; and the glory that ſhall follow; and of the latter it is ſaid; "The meek ſhall eat and be ſatisfied. They ſhall praiſe the Lord that ſeek him: Your heart ſhall live forever. All the ends of the world ſhall remember, and turn unto the Lord: And all the kindreds of the nations ſhall worſhip before thee. For the kingdom is the Lord's; and he is the Governor among the nations: For evil doers ſhall be cut off: But thoſe that wait upon the Lord, they ſhall inherit the earth. For yet a little while, and the wicked ſhall not be; yea, thou ſhalt diligently conſider his place, and it ſhall not be. But the meek ſhall inherit the earth, and delight themſelves in the abundance of peace."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. xxxvii. 9, 10, 11.</note> This is a prediction of an event which has never taken place yet. Evil doers and the wicked, have in all ages hitherto poſſeſſed the earth, and flouriſhed and reigned in the world. When it is promiſed, that they who wait upon the Lord, and the meek ſhall inherit the earth, and delight themſelves in the abundance of peace, the meaning muſt be, that perſons of this character will yet have the poſſeſſion of the earth, and fill the world, when no place ſhall be found for the wicked, as they ſhall be all deſtroyed, and their cauſe wholly loſt. And all of this character who have lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this time, and waited upon the Lord in the exerciſe of meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhall flouriſh and live in their ſucceſſors, and in the proſperity and triumph of the cauſe and intereſt, in which they lived and died. This is agreeable to other prophecies of this kind, as will be ſhewn in the ſequel. "All the ends of the earth ſhall remember and turn unto the Lord: And all the kindreds of the nations ſhall worſhip before thee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" Who can believe that this has ever yet been? But few of mankind, compared with the whole, have yet turned unto the Lord. By far the greateſt part of the nations of the earth, even to the ends of the world, have worſhipped and do
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:025635_0013_0FCEAC1A81130258"/>now worſhip falſe gods, and idols. But when <hi>all the ends of the world</hi> ſhall remember, and turn to the Lord; and all the kindreds of the nations ſhall worſhip before him; then the meek ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herit the earth, and delight themſelves in the abundance of peace.</p>
               <p>The whole of the ſixty ſeventh Pſalm is a prediction of the ſame event, and of the ſame time, which is yet to come. It is a prayer of the church that ſuch a time may take place; at the ſame time expreſſing her aſſurance that it was coming; and the whole is a prophecy of it. "God be merciful unto us, and bleſs us; and cauſe his face to ſhine upon us. That thy way may be known upon earth, thy ſaving health among <hi>all nations.</hi> Let the people praiſe thee, O God; let <hi>all the people</hi> praiſe thee. O let the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be glad, and ſing for joy; for thou ſhalt judge the people righteouſly, and govern the nations upon earth. Then ſhall the earth yield her increaſe; and God, even our God, ſhall bleſs us. God ſhall bleſs us; and <hi>all the ends of the earth ſhall fear him.</hi>"</p>
               <p>The ſeventy ſecond Pſalm, the title of which is, "A Pſalm for Solomon," contains a prophecy of Chriſt and his kingdom, of whom Solomon was an eminent type. The Pſalmiſt looks beyond the type to the antitype, and ſays things which can be applied to the latter only, and are not true of the former, conſidered as diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct from the latter; which is common in the ſcripture, in ſuch caſes. Here it is ſaid, "He ſhall come down like rain upon the mown graſs; as ſhowers that water the earth. In his days ſhall the righteous flouriſh; and abundance of peace ſo long as the moon endureth. He ſhall have dominion alſo from ſea to ſea, and from the river unto the ends of the earth. All kings ſhall fall down before him: All nations ſhall ſerve him. His name ſhall endure forever: His name ſhall be continued as long as the ſun and moon ſhall be bleſſed in him: All nations ſhall call him bleſſed. Bleſſed be the Lord God, the God of Iſrael, who only doth wondrous things. And bleſſed be his glorious name for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, and let the whole earth be filled with his glory; Amen, and Amen."</p>

In the ſecond Pſalm, the heathen, i. e. the nations, all nations, are given to Chriſt for his inheritance; and here the ſame thing is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, "Thou ſhalt inherit all nations." And by his <hi>judging the earth,</hi> is meant his reigning and ſubduing the inhabitants of the earth, to a cordial ſubjection to himſelf; which will be more evident by what follows, where we ſhall find the ſame thing pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted.</p>
               <p>The ninety ſixth Pſalm, relates wholly to redemption by Chriſt; to the happineſs and glory of his kingdom, and his reign on earth. "O worſhip the Lord in the beauty of holineſs: <hi>Fear before him, all the earth.</hi> Say among the heathen, that the Lord reigneth: The world alſo ſhall be eſtabliſhed, that it ſhall not be moved, he ſhall judge the people righteouſly. Let the heavens re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice, and let the earth be glad: Let the ſea roar, and the fulneſs thereof. Let the field be joyful, and all that is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in: Then ſhall all the trees of the wood rejoice before the Lord; for he cometh to judge the earth: He ſhall judge the world with righteouſneſs, and the people with his truth." What is here foretold, is to take place before the end of the world, and the general judgment; and it relates to the whole world, all the earth and the nations in it; the kingdom and reign of Chriſt is to extend to all of them: And his coming to judge the earth, and the world in righteouſneſs, intends his reigning in righteouſneſs, and bringing all nations to ſhare in the bleſſings of his ſalvation and kingdom. Agreeable to this, it is ſaid by Chriſt, by Iſaiah and Jeremiah, "Behold a king ſhall reign <hi>in righteouſneſs.</hi> In thoſe days, and at that time, will I cauſe the branch of righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to grow up unto David, and he ſhall execute <hi>judgment and righteouſneſs</hi> in the land," or in the earth.

               </p>
               <p>Great part of the prophecy of Iſaiah, relates to the flouriſhing and happy ſtate of the kingdom of Chriſt, and the proſperity of the church in the latter days. When he foretells the return of the people of Iſrael from the Babyloniſh captivity, which was a type of the deliverance of the church of Chriſt from ſpiritual Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, and from all her enemies in this world, viſible and inviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, he commonly looks forward to the latter, and keeps that in view, and ſays things of it, which are not true of the former, and cannot be applied to it. And as Zion, Jeruſalem, and Judah, and
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:025635_0015_0FCEAC1F04C150D0"/>Iſrael, were types of the church and kingdom of Chriſt, as includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all nations, the former are commonly mentioned only as types, being put for, and ſygnifying the latter. And when the goſpel day, the coming of Chriſt, and his church and kingdom, are brought into view, all that is included in theſe is comprehended; and commonly chief reference is had to the Millennium, or the day of the flouriſhing of the kingdom of Chriſt on earth, which is in a peculiar manner, and eminently the day of ſalvation; and will iſſue in the complete redemption of the church, at and after the day of judgment. He who reads this prophecy with care and diſcerning, will be convinced of the truth of theſe obſervations; and in any other view, great part of it cannot be underſtood.</p>
               <p>Only part of the many prophecies of the glory and extent of the kingdom of Chriſt in this world, which are contained in this book, will be now mentioned, as thoſe which are moſt expreſs and clear, with reference to the ſubject in view. They who attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly read this prophecy, will find many more which refer to the ſame event.</p>

               </p>
               <p>This is evidently a prophecy of Chriſt, and his kingdom on earth. He ſhall judge and reprove for the meek of the earth, and ſlay all the wicked on earth, that the meek may inherit it; which is exactly agreeable to the forementioned prophecy in the thirty ſeventh Pſalm. "Evil doers ſhall be cut off, and yet a little while and the wicked ſhall not be; but the meek ſhall inh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And this univerſal peace and harmony among men, which ſhall take place at that time, is expreſſed in the prophecy before us, in very ſtrong, figurative language; by the wolf dwelling with the lamb, &amp;c.— And the ground and reaſon of this is given. "For the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſea." By the knowledge of the Lord is meant true religion, or real chriſtianity, which conſiſts moſt effentially in benevolence and goodneſs, as has been ſhown. So far as this takes place, love, peace, and the moſt happy concord and union, are promoted; and every thing contrary to this ſuppreſſed and baniſhed. Therefore, when this ſhall take place univerſally among men, and fill the earth, as the waters cover the ſea, there will be nothing to deſtroy or hurt, but univerſal ſafety, peace and love. No ſuch time has ever been yet known. The true knowledge of God has been ſo far from filling the earth; that groſs darkneſs has covered much the greateſt part of it; and real chriſtianity has been confined to narrow bounds; and but very few of mankind have attained to the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter of true chriſtians, even where the goſpel has been publiſhed. And a horrible ſcene of oppreſſion, cruelty, war and murder, has
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:025635_0017_0FCEAC2477516850"/>ſpread all over the earth; and will continue to do ſo, until Chriſt ſhall ariſe and ſmite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and ſlay the wicked with the breath of his lips; and cauſe the earth to be filled with the knowledge of God. Such a happy time is yet future, and will certainly come.</p>
               <p>The twenty fifth chapter contains a prophecy of the ſame event, ſome of which is worthy to be tranſcribed. "And in this moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, ſhall the Lord of hoſts make unto <hi>all people</hi> a feaſt of fat things, a feaſt of wine on the lees, of fat things full of marrow, of wines on the lees well refined.

               <p>The goſpel is here repreſented by a rich feaſt; and it is promiſed that all people and nations ſhall have their eyes opened to ſee it; and all reproach, and oppoſition to the church of Chriſt, ſhall be taken away from off all the earth; and there ſhall be univerſal joy in the ſalvation, for which the church has long waited, and which ſhall come in the laſt day.</p>

It does refer to the firſt introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the coming of Chriſt into the world; but is not confined to this: It gives a comprehenſive view of this great ſalvation, and the favour and glory which is to come to the church of Chriſt in

Upon ſuch promiſes made to the church, ſhe breaks forth into joy and praiſe, in the proſpect of the good that is coming to her. "I will greatly rejoice in the Lord, my ſoul ſhall be joyful in my God; for he hath clothed me with the garments of ſalvation; he hath covered me with the robe of righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, as a bridegroom decketh himſelf with ornaments, and as a bride adorneth herſelf with jewels.

               <p>In the prophecy of Jeremiah, the following paſſages are found, which predict the utter abolition of idolatry on earth, and the converſion of all nations to chriſtianity, which events have not yet come to paſs. "At that time they ſhall call Jeruſalem (i. e. the church) the throne of the Lord (i. e. The Lord ſhall reign in and by it.) And all nations ſhall be gathered unto it, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<note n="†" place="bottom">Chap. iii. 17.</note> They ſhall wholly renounce their idolatry, and all their wickedneſs. "Thus ſhall ye ſay unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens and the earth, even they ſhall periſh from the earth, and from under thoſe hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. They are vanity, and the work of errors. In the time of their viſitation they ſhall periſh."
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Chap. x. 11, 15.</note> According to this prophecy, this will take place while this earth and the heavens remain, and therefore before the day of judgment.</p>
               <p>This ſubject is ſet in a very clear light in the book of Daniel the Prophet. It is there repeatedly declared that the church, or king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt, ſhall be the laſt kingdom on earth; that it ſhall ſucceed four preceding monarchies, become great, and fill the world, and exiſt in a very happy and glorious ſtate on earth. By the dream of Nebuchadnezzar, and the interpretation of it in the ſecond chapter of Daniel, the kingdom of Chriſt is ſet in this light. The image which Nebuchadnezzar ſaw, repreſents four kingdoms or monarchies, viz. 1. The Babylonian. 2. The Medo Perſian, or that of the Medes and Perſians. 3. The Macedonian or Grecian. 4. The Roman. Theſe are all to paſs away and be deſtroyed, to make way for a fifth kingdom, which ſhall be great, and fill the world; which is deſcribed in the dream, by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing words: "Thou ſaweſt till a ſtone was cut out without hands, which ſmote the image upon his feet that were of iron and clay, and break them in pieces. Then were the iron, the clay,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:025635_0021_0FCEAC2B2A9CAD18"/>the braſs, the ſilver and gold, broken to pieces together, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came like the chaff of the ſummer threſhing floors, and the wind carried them away, that no place was found for them: And the ſtone that ſmote the image became a great mountain, and <hi>filled the whole earth.</hi> This is interpreted by Daniel in the following words: "And in the days of theſe kings ſhall the God of heaven ſet up a kingdom, which ſhall never be deſtroyed: And the kingdom ſhall not be left to other people, but it ſhall break in pieces, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume all theſe kingdoms, and it ſhall ſtand forever. For as much as thou ſaweſt that the ſtone was cut out of the mountain without hands, and that it broke in pieces the iron, the braſs, the clay, the ſilver and gold, the great God hath made known to the king what ſhall come to paſs hereafter." That this laſt kingdom is the kingdom of Chriſt, there can be no doubt.
<note n="*" place="bottom">See Newton on the Prophecies, vol. I. p. 426, 427, &amp;c.</note> The ſame is called in the New Teſtament, "The kingdom of God, or the kingdom of heaven." This is to ſucceed the kingdom of the Romans, and to fill the whole earth, in which all nations, all mankind will be included. The Roman empire or kingdom, is not yet wholly deſtroyed; therefore what is here predicted of the kingdom of Chriſt is not yet accompliſhed, but ſhall take place in ſome future day. Nothing can be plainer and more certain than this.</p>
               <p>In the ſeventh chapter of this book there is a repreſentation of the ſame thing in a viſion which Daniel had. He ſaw the ſame four empires or kingdoms in their ſucceſſion, repreſented by four great, wild, fierce beaſts, coming up from the ſea. The laſt king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom turned into a little horn which came up laſt; and Daniel "beheld till this fourth beaſt with the little horn was ſlain, and his body deſtroyed, and given to the burning flame." And then the viſion proceeds, "I ſaw in the night viſions, and beheld, one like the Son of man, come with the clouds of heaven, and came to the ancient of days, and they brought him near before him. And there was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages ſhould ſerve him: His domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion is an everlaſting dominion, which ſhall not paſs away, and his kingdom that which ſhall not be deſtroyed." This viſion is briefly explained to Daniel in the following words: "Theſe great beaſts, which are four, are four kings (i. e. kingdoms) which ſhall ariſe out of the earth. But the ſaints of the Moſt High ſhall take the kingdom, and poſſeſs the kingdom forever, even for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:025635_0022_0FCEAC2C81EFE538"/>and ever." Daniel requeſted a more particular explanation of the fourth beaſt, and of the ten horns, and of the little horn, "Even of that horn that had eyes, and a mouth that ſpake very great things, whoſe look was more ſtout than his fellows. And the ſame horn made war with the ſaints and prevailed againſt them; until the ancient of days came, and judgment was given to the ſaints of the Moſt High; and the time came that the ſaints poſſeſſed the kingdom." And he is then told, "That the fourth beaſt ſhall be the fourth kingdom upon earth. And the ten horns out of this kingdom, are ten kings that ſhall ariſe: And another ſhall riſe after them, and he ſhall be diverſe from the firſt, and he ſhall ſubdue three kings. And he ſhall ſpeak great words againſt the Moſt High, and ſhall wear out the ſaints of the Moſt High, and think to change times and laws: And they ſhall be given in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hand, until a time, and times, and the dividing of time. But the judgment ſhall ſit, and they ſhall take away his dominion, to conſume and to deſtroy it to the end. <hi>And the kingdom and domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and the greatneſs of the kingdom under the whole heaven, ſhall be given to the people of the ſaints of the Moſt High,</hi> whoſe kingdom is an everlaſting kingdom, and all dominions ſhall ſerve and obey him."</p>
               <p>As in Nebuchadnezzar's dream, ſo in this viſion, the fifth and laſt kingdom, is the kingdom of Chriſt, conſiſting wholly of ſaints. It is Jeſus Chriſt whom Daniel ſaw, "And behold, one like to the Son of man, came with the clouds of heaven. And there was given him dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations and languages ſhould ſerve him." His kingdom and do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion is univerſal, including all the inhabitants of the earth. And theſe ſhall be all ſaints or holy perſons; as no others can be the proper ſubjects of this kingdom. "The ſaints of the Moſt High ſhall take the kingdom, and poſſeſs the kingdom forever. And the kingdom, and dominion, and the greatneſs of the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom under the whole heaven, ſhall be given to the people of the ſaints of the Moſt High." The ſtrongeſt expreſſions are uſed and repeated, to aſſert the univerſality of this kingdom, comprehend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all mankind who ſhall then live on earth. And it is repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edly declared, that this kingdom ſhall ſtand forever. It ſhall not be deſtroyed by any ſucceeding power or kingdom, as the former kingdoms were, but ſhall continue to the end of the world, and then be removed to heaven, to a more perfect and glorious ſtate; and there exiſt and flouriſh in the higheſt perfection forever and ever.</p>

The little horn which was on the beaſt, and deſtroyed with the beaſt, whoſe body was given to the burning flame, is the Pope of Rome, with the kingdom and power, civil and eccleſiaſtical, of which he is the head.
<note n="*" place="bottom">This is abundantly proved in Newton's Diſſertation on the Prophecies, vol. I. page 441—492.</note> This beaſt with this horn, is not yet de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed.

This is very evident by theſe prophecies, if there were no other; but this truth is greatly illuſtrated and eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by thoſe predictions of the ſame event which have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered; and more ſo, by thoſe which are yet to be mentioned.</p>
               <p>The Prophet Micah predicted the proſperity of the church of Chriſt, and the prevalence of his intereſt and kingdom <hi>in the laſt days.</hi>

And there ſhall be a conſtant flow of living waters, without any interruption, into all parts of the earth, among all nations; that is ſpiritual bleſſings, conſiſting in ſpiritual life, holy joy and happineſs. And then all idolatry and falſe worſhip ſhall be wholly aboliſhed; and Chriſt ſhall reign in all the earth, and all nations ſhall truſt in him, and obey him. This prediction agrees exactly with all thoſe which have been mentioned, pointing out the ſame important glorious event.</p>
               <p>THE prophecies in the New Teſtament, foretold the univerſal ſpread of chriſtianity, until all nations ſhall become the ſervants of Chriſt; and that Chriſt and his people ſhall reign on earth a thouſand years; when ſatan ſhall be caſt out of the earth, and his ſubjects and kingdom ſhall be deſtroyed; agreeable to the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous prophecies in the Old Teſtament, which have been mentioned.</p>
               <p>Jeſus Chriſt has foretold this, by the following parables.— "Another parable put he forth unto them, ſaying, The kingdom of heaven is like to a grain of muſtard ſeed, which a man took and ſowed in his field. Which indeed is the leaſt of all ſeeds: But when it is grown, it is the greateſt among herbs, and becometh a tree; ſo that the birds of the air come and lodge in the branches thereof. Another parable ſpake he unto them, The kingdom of heaven is like unto leaven, which a woman took and hid in three meaſures of meal, till the whole was leavened."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. xiii. 31, 32, 33.</note> By the firſt of thoſe parables Chriſt teaches, that his church and kingdom, though ſmall in the beginning of it, ſhould increaſe and become great in the world. In the next, he makes an advance, and more fully predicts the univerſal extent of this kingdom; that the goſpel ſhall not ceaſe to ſpread and influence the world, till all mankind, living on earth, the whole world, ſhall be formed by it, and imbibe
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:025635_0025_0FCEAC3284048C98"/>the ſpirit of it; ſo as to become the children of this kingdom. If the kingdom of heaven ſhall not finally prevail and extend to all nations, and fill the whole world, how can this parable be a juſt or true repreſentation of it? In this view of it, it agrees exactly with many of the prophecies which have been mentioned; and with others, which are yet to be conſidered.</p>
               <p>Agreeable to this, are the following words of Chriſt, in which indeed he aſſerts the ſame thing, "Now is the judgment of this world: Now ſhall the prince of this world be caſt out. And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Joh: xii. 31, 32.</note>— What is here foretold by Chriſt, is not yet accompliſhed, except in a very ſmall part, as the firſt fruits and pledge of the whole.— A foundation for this was laid in the death of Chriſt, when he was lifted up on the croſs; but the prince of this world, the devil, is not yet caſt out of the world; nor has Chriſt yet drawn all men unto him. Chriſt has drawn great numbers to him, who have become his faithful ſubjects and ſervants, and has made great in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads upon the intereſt and kingdom of the prince of this world; but very few of mankind, compared with the whole, have been drawn to Chriſt; by far the greateſt number even in the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian world, have rejected and oppoſed him; and the kingdom of ſatan has been great and ſtrong, including the moſt of men who have lived in the world, from the time in which theſe words were ſpoken by Chriſt, to this day. Both of theſe events are therefore yet future, and the former is to make way for the latter; or rather one is included in the other. The ſame things which are here foretold, are predicted in different words, in the twentieth chapter of the Revelation, which will be conſidered. When Chriſt ſays, He will draw <hi>all men</hi> unto him, he does not mean that every one of mankind ſhall come unto him; for this is contrary to known fact; and to many expreſs declarations of Chriſt. But that in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of his death, the kingdom of ſatan ſhall be utterly deſtroyed on earth, and then all nations, even all men then in the world, ſhall become his voluntary ſubjects, and believe in him.</p>
               <p>This was ſuited to ſupport and comfort his diſciples and friends at that time, when he had been ſpeaking of his own death as at hand, in the view of the glory that ſhould follow his dying on the croſs: and ſerved to explain what was ſpoken by the voice from
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:025635_0026_0FCEAC3401736238"/>heaven, in anſwer to his petition, "Father, glorify thy name."— "I have both glorified it, and will glorify it again."

               <p>What the Apoſtle Paul ſays in the eleventh chapter of his epiſtle to the Romans, of the Jews and Gentiles, which compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend all mankind, holds forth this ſame truth. He there ſpeaks of the Jews who were then, the moſt of them, broken off from the church by unbelief, as yet to come into the kingdom of Chriſt, even all of them, which he terms their <hi>fulneſs.</hi> And he ſays, that when they ſhall in their fulneſs be brought in, the fulneſs of the Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles ſhall come in alſo. The fulneſs of the Jews, and the fulneſs of the Gentiles, muſt include the whole of all nations. And he ſpeaks of what had taken place in the days of the Apoſtles, in the converſion of Jews and Gentiles, as only the firſt fruits, the root, foundation and beginning, of the whole lump, and the tree which were to follow in the coming in of the Jews and Gentiles, of the whole world, in the fulneſs thereof.

               <p>This leads to recollect the many prophecies by the ancient Prophets, of the reſtoration of the Jews to a ſtate of holineſs and happineſs, in the laſt days, which has not yet come to paſs, ſome of which it may be proper to mention here, as they ſerve to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the point under conſideration. The thirty fourth, thirty ſixth, and thirty ſeventh chapters of Ezekiel, relate chiefly to this event. Though the return of the Jews from their captivity in Babylon, may be implied in this prophecy, and ſome expreſſions may have particular reference to that; yet it evidently looks far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, to a deliverance and ſalvation, of which their return from Babylon was a type or pledge: And there are many things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted, which cannot be applied to the former, and were not true of it. Particularly the following: "I will ſet up one ſhepherd over them, and he ſhall <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And I will cleanſe them, ſo ſhall they be my people, and I will be their God. And David, my ſervant, ſhall be king over them, and they all ſhall have one ſhepherd. They ſhall alſo walk in my judgments, and obſerve my ſtatutes, and do them. And they ſhall dwell in the land that I have given unto Jacob my ſervant, wherein your fathers have dwelt, and they ſhall dwell therein, even they and their children, and their childrens'
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:025635_0027_0FCEAC35A95C7C58"/>children forever, and my ſervant David, ſhall be their prince for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. xxxiv. 23. xxxvii. 22, 23, 24, 25.</note> By David, Jeſus Chriſt the Son of David is meant, as the former was an eminent type of the latter. Therefore this muſt refer to their reſtoration and happy ſtate under Chriſt, which is certainly not yet come; but will take place, when there ſhall be one fold, and one ſhepherd, and Jews and Gentiles ſhall be united in one church under the Redeemer, which, after the Millennium, ſhall be tranſplanted from earth to heaven; where the ſpiritual David will reign over it forever.</p>
               <p>The ſame is foretold by the Prophet Hoſea. "The children of Iſrael ſhall abide many days without a king, and without a prince, and without a ſacrifice, and without an image, and without an ephod, and without teraphim. Afterward ſhall the children of Iſrael return, and ſeek the Lord their God, and David their king, and ſhall fear the Lord, and his goodneſs in the latter days."

They are without an image, without an ephod and teraphim; for they have a great and obſtinate averſion from all kinds of idolatry, to which they were once ſo much addicted. They have been a long time, many days, in this ſtate, and will continue ſo, until they return, and ſeek Jeſus Chriſt their king, and ſubmit to him, which is yet to come.</p>
               <p>Theſe prophecies, and others of the ſame kind, if they be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as having reference to the Jews excluſively, and not includ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole church of Chriſt, in the latter day, compoſed of Jews and Gentiles, do prove that there is yet to be a time, when the church of Chriſt ſhall be univerſal, and include all nations: For it appears from what St. Paul ſays, that when thoſe prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies ſhall be fulfilled to the Jews, the fulneſs of the Gentiles will alſo come in, and all men in every nation will be ſubject to Chriſt, and his kingdom ſhall be glorious, and fill the world. And in this ſenſe "All Iſrael ſhall be ſaved."</p>
               <p>IN the revelation made by Jeſus Chriſt to the Apoſtle John, the final victory and triumph of the church on earth, over all her ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the happy ſtate to which it will be brought, which ſhall
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:025635_0028_0FCEAC37DDF0FA60"/>continue a thouſand years, is, in ſome reſpects, more clearly ſet forth, than in the preceding prophecies; by which they are illuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated, and their meaning is more fully fixed and confirmed. Here the general ſtate and circumſtances of the church, from the time when the revelation was given, to this time, and down to the end of the world, are predicted. Here the afflictions and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutions, through which the church ſhould paſs; the reſpite which ſhe ſhould have, and victory over the perſecuting power of hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Rome, in the days of Conſtantine; the grand apoſtacy which ſhould take place in the church by the riſe of the Pope, and the hierarchy of the falſe church of Rome; the groſs idolatry which ſhould be practiſed in that church; and the violent oppoſition of this power to the true followers of Chriſt; their cruel perſecutions of them, and ſhedding their blood, for a thouſand two hundred and ſixty years; the judgments that ſhould be executed on that corrupt church and her adherents, and on the whole world, for their obſtinacy in wickedneſs; and the final overthrow of the Pope and all who ſupport him, and of the kingdom of ſatan in the world, and the deliverance of the church of Chriſt into a ſtate of reſt and peace, when this kingdom of Chriſt ſhall increaſe and ſpread, and fill the world; and continue in this happy ſtate on earth a thouſand years: All this is foretold; much of which is already come to paſs; but the moſt happy and glorious events are yet to come. The great and remarkable things which have come to paſs, as they were foretold, are a ſtanding, inconteſtible evidence and demonſtration, that the prophecies in this book are from heaven: For it is as certain, that none but the omniſcient God can know and predict ſuch events, which take place accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the prediction, as it is that this world was made by him. And the events which are come to paſs, and are now taking place in the world before our eyes, agreeable to the prophecies in this book, at the ſame time that they prove that thoſe predictions are from God, are alſo a pledge and aſſurance, that the prophecies of things not yet come, will be fulfilled in due ſeaſon.</p>
               <p>The ſubject now in hand, will lead more particularly to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider what are the prophecies in this book, which relate to the future proſperity of the church and kingdom of Chriſt in this world, in which all the darkneſs and afflictions which do attend it, being oppreſſed and trodden down by enemies, while they prevail
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:025635_0029_0FCEAC3943453438"/>and triumph, ſhall iſſue; and to ſhow that ſuch a day is certainly coming, according to the predictions which are to be found here.</p>
               <p>In the fifth chapter of the Revelation, the four and twenty elders, who repreſent the church, appear rejoicing and praiſing Chriſt in the proſpect of their reigning on the earth. "And they ſung a new ſong, ſaying, Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the ſeals thereof: For thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeemed us to God by thy blood, out of every kindred, and tongue, and people, and nation; and haſt made us unto our God kings and prieſts: <hi>And we ſhall reign on the earth.</hi>" This is ſpoken of <hi>the church,</hi> and is not literally true of every particular member of it, that then actually exiſted in heaven, or on earth. When the church ſhall reign on earth, conſiſting of the numerous members who ſhall then exiſt in this world; all thoſe who are gone out of the world, and are in heaven, will reign in and with the church on earth, as members of the ſame ſociety and kingdom; and will partake in all the joy and glory of this event, in a much higher de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree than if they were perſonally on earth. They will reign in their ſucceſſors, who repreſent them, and in the prevalence, victory and triumph of that cauſe, which is theirs, and in which they lived and died. But this will be more particularly conſidered hereafter.</p>
               <p>"And the ſeventh angel ſounded, and there were great voices in heaven, ſaying, The kingdoms of this world are become the kingdom of our Lord, and of his Chriſt, and he ſhall reign forever and ever."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. x. 15.</note> Here it is aſſerted, that under the ſeventh trumpet, which contains all the events from the time of its ſounding, to the end of the world, all the nations and kingdoms in this world ſhall become one kingdom, under Chriſt, and ſhall be wholly ſwallowed up in this kingdom, which ſhall not be ſucceeded or give place to any other kingdom; but ſhall ſtand forever. It ſhall continue the only kingdom on earth to the end of the world, and exiſt forever in heaven. Which is perfectly agreeable to many other prophecies which have been mentioned. The mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing is not, that this event ſhall follow immediately upon the ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the ſeventh trumpet; but that this is comprehended in the events of this trumpet, to which all the preceding have reſpect, and in which they ſhall iſſue, as the moſt important and glorious
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:025635_0030_0FCEAC3AE5D6D038"/>event, to which all the inhabitants of heaven were attending, and in the proſpect of which they had peculiar joy.</p>
               <p>The ſame event is celebrated in heaven, as having actually taken place, in the former part of the nineteenth chapter. "And I heard as it were the voice of a great multitude, and as the voice of many waters, and as the voice of mighty thunderings, ſaying, Hallelujah! for the Lord God omnipotent reigneth: Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herſelf ready. And to her was granted, that ſhe ſhould be arrayed in fine linen, clean and white: For the fine linen is the righteouſneſs of ſaints. And he ſaid unto me, Write, Bleſſed are they who are called unto the marriage ſupper of the Lamb. And he ſaith unto me, Theſe are the true ſayings of God." Here the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented as reigning, as he never had done before; which is the ſame event which is ſo often predicted in the Pſalms, and by the Prophets, eſpecially by Daniel, by the Lord's reigning, that is Chriſt. And which is mentioned and celebrated in the tenth chapter; and in the twentieth chapter; "And I ſaw thrones, and they ſat upon them, and judgment was given unto them, and they lived and reigned with Chriſt a thouſand years." By the bride having made herſelf ready, and being arrayed in fine linen, clean and white, is meant the eminent degree of holineſs and moral beauty, to which the church will arrive at that day, in the Millennium ſtate. This is repreſented as taking place upon the fall of antichriſt, and the great whore, the falſe idolatrous church of Rome. And it ſucceeds the overthrow of ſatan's kingdom in the world, and not only the deſtruction of the Roman empire un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der antichriſt, but of all the nations of wicked men; which is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed in the ſixteenth chapter, verſe ſeventeenth, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>And the ſame event is again repreſented in the latter part of the nineteenth chapter, and in the beginning of the twentieth. "And I ſaw heaven opened, and behold, a white horſe: And he that ſat upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteouſneſs he doth judge and make war." From the following deſcription it appears, that this perſon is Jeſus Chriſt prepared, and going forth to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy his enemies on earth. And an angel is ſeen ſtanding in the ſun, in the moſt conſpicuous place, calling with a loud voice upon all the fowls of the air to come "to the ſupper of the great God,"
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:025635_0031_0FCEAC3D6EC0DF40"/>to eat the fleſh of kings and captains, &amp;c. and the fleſh of <hi>all men,</hi> both free and bond, both ſmall and great. And he ſaw the beaſt and the kings of the earth, and their armies <hi>gathered together,</hi> to make war againſt him that ſat on the horſe, and againſt his army." And the beaſt and falſe prophet were deſtroyed by him; and the remnant of thoſe who joined with the beaſt and were enemies to Chriſt, were ſlain by him. This battle, and the deſtruction of the enemies of Chriſt, does not follow in time, and is not to take place after the events mentioned in the firſt part of this chapter, viz. the joy and praiſe in heaven, upon the reigning of Chriſt on earth, and the bride, the Lamb's wife, making herſelf ready, &amp;c. but is a repeated and more particular repreſentation of what is to precede that happy event, which had been before mentioned in the ſixteenth chapter, from the thirteenth verſe to the end of it. There the kings of the earth, and the whole world, are ſaid to be <hi>gath<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>red together to battle;</hi> "The battle of the great day of God Almighty." So here "The beaſt and the kings of the earth, and their armies, are <hi>gathered together to make war</hi> againſt him that ſat on the horſe." And there the battle is deſcribed as coming on, upon the pouring out of the ſeventh vial, and great Babylon, which is the ſame with the beaſt, and the falſe prophet, and all the enemies of Chriſt, are deſtroyed in battle. Which is exactly paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel with the war and battle of which there is a more particular de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription in the nineteenth chapter, and muſt be one and the ſame event. This is confirmed, by what immediately follows this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of the enemies of Chriſt, in the beginning of the twentieth chapter, which, as has been obſerved, is the ſame event with that deſcribed in the nineteenth chapter by the marriage of the Lamb, whoſe bride, that is the church, was made ready, and arrayed in fine linen, clean and white. A more particular and remarkable deſcription of this ſame thing, in the twentieth chapter, is in the following words.</p>
               <p>"And I ſaw an angel come down from heaven, having the key of the bottomleſs pit, and a great chain in his hand. And he laid hold on the dragon, that old ſerpent, which is the devil and ſatan, and bound him a thouſand years, and caſt him into the bottomleſs pit, and ſh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>t him up, and ſet a ſeal upon him, that he ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the nations no more, till the thouſand years ſhould be fulfill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: And after that, he muſt be looſed a little ſeaſon. And I ſaw thrones, and they ſat upon them, and judgment was given unto
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:025635_0032_0FCEAC3E8756E800"/>them. And I ſaw the ſouls of them that were beheaded for the witneſs of Jeſus, and for the word of God, and which had not worſhipped the beaſt, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands: And they lived and reigned with Chriſt a thouſand years. But the reſt of the dead lived not again until the thouſand years were finiſhed. This is the firſt reſurrection. Bleſſed and holy is he that hath part in the firſt reſurrection. On ſuch the ſecond death hath no power; but they ſhall be prieſts of God, and of Chriſt, and ſhall reign with him a thouſand years."</p>
               <p>A particular explanation of this paſſage of ſcripture will be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted in the next ſection. That it does expreſs and confirm the truth which is contained in the numerous prophecies which have been mentioned, and which is ſet up to be proved in this ſection, the following obſervations will ſhow.</p>
               <p n="1">1. This event here predicted, is to take place after the overthrow of the Roman antichriſtian kingdom, and the deſtruction of all the enemies of Chriſt and his church on earth. This is evident from the account of the deſtruction of theſe in the prophecy im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately preceding theſe words, and upon which the glorious ſcene opened in this paſſage, is to take place. And the ſame is predicted in the laſt part of the ſixteenth chapter, as has been ſhown. This is agreeable to the prophecies of the ſame event, in the Pſalms, and by Daniel, and others, viz. that the time of the reign of Chriſt, and of the ſaints on earth, ſhall ſucceed the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the wicked, and the total overthrow of all the preceding kingdoms and powers in the world, which has been from time to time obſerved upon them, when they were tranſcribed. And in this very paſſage, ſatan himſelf is repreſented as bound, and caſt out of the earth, and ſhut up in the bottomleſs pit, antecedent to the reign of Chriſt, and his followers, in the world; which neceſſarily implies the total ruin of his cauſe and kingdom on earth, and the extirpation of all the wicked, who are his children and ſervants. Therefore, the time here predicted, is not yet come.</p>
               <p n="2">2. All this is to take place before the end of the world, and the day of judgment. This is very evident and certain, ſince it is ſaid, that when this happy time of a thouſand years is ended, ſatan ſhall be looſed out of his priſon, and ſhall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth: And then, after this, Chriſt is repreſented as coming to judgment, of which
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:025635_0033_0FCEAC402C479A10"/>there is a particular account; and of the final and eternal deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all his enemies.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Chriſt is here ſaid to reign, and his ſaints to reign with him, which, without any doubt, is the ſame event, and the ſame period, which is foretold by Daniel and other Prophets, as a moſt happy and joyful time, when that nation and thoſe men who will not ſerve Jeſus Chriſt, ſhall be deſtroyed; and there ſhall be given to him dominion and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages ſhould ſerve him. And the kingdom and domin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and the greatneſs of the kingdom under the whole heaven, ſhall be given to the ſaints of the Moſt High, and all dominions ſhall ſerve him. And the extent and univerſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lity of the kingdom of Chriſt, and of thoſe who reign with him, as including all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and all men, is ſuppoſed and implied in his binding ſatan and caſting him out, "that he ſhould <hi>deceive the nations no more,</hi> till the thouſand years ſhould be fulfilled." Satan is ſaid to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the whole world.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. xii. 9.</note> And when he is caſt out of the whole world, Jeſus Chriſt and his people will take poſſeſſion of it, and reign in all the earth.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Chriſt and his people are to reign on earth A THOUSAND YEARS.
<note n="†" place="bottom">Hence this time is called the MILLENNIUM, which ſignifies a thouſand years.</note> All have not been agreed in the length of time denoted here by a thouſand years. Some have ſuppoſed that a thouſand years, is uſed indefinitely, not to expreſs any preciſe number of years, but a great number of years, or a long time. But this can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not reaſonably be admitted as the ſenſe of the expreſſion here, ſince this preciſe number of years, is mentioned ſix times in this paſſage, which appears inconſiſtent with its being uſed in ſuch an indefinite, vague ſenſe. And beſides, there is nothing in the connection here, or in the nature or circumſtances of the caſe, to lead any one to underſtand this number, as put indefinitely.</p>
               <p>There are others who ſuppoſe, that theſe are to be underſtood to be a thouſand prophetical years, that is, as many years as there are days in a thouſand literal years, a day being put for a year.— According to this way of reckoning, a thouſand years are put for three hundred and ſixty thouſand years; for in that age, a year was reckoned to conſiſt of three hundred and ſixty days. It is ſaid, that in this book of Revelation, a day is conſtantly put for a year. A thouſand, two hundred and ſixty days, mean ſo many
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:025635_0034_0FCEAC4257BD1660"/>years, and forty two months, mean as many years, as there are days in ſo many months, reckoning thirty days to each month, as they then did; which therefore amount to the ſame number of years, i. e. one thouſand, two hundred and ſixty years. And a time and times, and half a time, i. e. three years and an half, mean as many years as there are days in three years and an half; which are juſt as many as there are in forty two months; that is, one thouſand, two hundred and ſixty years. It is therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded, that theſe thouſand years, muſt be underſtood in the ſame way; that is, that a day is put for a year; which will amount to three hundred and ſixty thouſand years.</p>
               <p>It is acknowledged that this ſuppoſition is ſupported by ſome colour of argument, and plauſibility: But there are objections to it, ſome of which will be mentioned.</p>
               <p n="1">1. It does by no means follow that theſe are prophetical years, in the ſenſe mentioned, becauſe a day is put for a year, in other places in this prophecy. There may be reaſons for putting a day for a year, in other inſtances; and yet there be no reaſon for put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a thouſand years for as many years as there are days in a thouſand years, in this inſtance; and therefore no reaſon for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding them ſo. And a day is not put for a year in every other inſtance in this book. The dead bodies of the two witneſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> are ſaid to lie in the ſtreet of the city, three days and an half,
<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. xi. 11.</note> which do not mean three years and an half, as no event reſpecting them can be made conſiſtent with ſuch a meaning.</p>
               <p n="2">2. The number, <hi>a thouſand years,</hi> being repeated ſo many times in one ſhort paragraph, ſeems to be a reaſon that it is to be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood literally, for juſt ſo many years, and not ſo many prophetical years. Eſpecially, as there is nothing in this caſe to lead us to underſtand it in the latter ſenſe; but it may, as conſiſtently with every thing in this book, and this prophecy in particular, and more ſo, as will be now obſerved, be underſtood literally. And it is farther to be obſerved, that there is no inſtance in this book, or in the whole Bible, where a preciſe number is ſo often repeated in the ſame words, that is not to be underſtood literally.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It ſeems to be out of all proper proportion, to ſuppoſe there will be ſo long a time as three hundred and ſixty thouſand years of proſperity and happineſs, and of great and univerſal holineſs in this world, the habitation of an apoſtate, ſinful race of men; and
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:025635_0035_0FCEAC43BAAD8BA0"/>but ſix thouſand years of evil times. And this does not appear conſiſtent with this world being repreſented as an <hi>evil world,</hi> as it is in the ſcripture: Or with its being curſed in conſequence of man's rebellion. One thouſand years may be an exception out of ſeven thouſand, in which the curſe may be mitigated, and in a great meaſure removed; and yet, on the whole, or the whole taken together, it may be conſidered and called, an evil and accurſed world, for man's ſake. But if there were to be only ſix thouſand years of evil and the curſe, and three hundred and ſixty thouſand years of good and a bleſſing, it would not, on the whole, be an evil or curſed, but a happy and bleſſed world.</p>
               <p n="4">4. It has been obſerved, that the natural world is evidently a deſigned type or ſhadow of the moral world, eſpecially of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption by Chriſt. And that creating it in ſix days, and then reſting on the ſeventh, is deſigned to be a type of bringing the moral world in the work of redemption, to a ſtate of reſt; that there are to be ſix thouſand years in which every thing with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to redemption and the kingdom of Chriſt, is to be done and prepared, for a ſeventh thouſand years of peace and reſt, and joy in this glorious work. And it will be ſhown in the ſequel, that there are inſtitutions in the Moſaic ritual, which point out the ſame thing. The Apoſtle Peter ſeems to allude to this, when ſpeaking of the coming of Chriſt, and the end of the world. "But beloved, be not ignorant of this one thing, that one day is with the Lord as a thouſand years, and a thouſand years as one day. The Lord is not ſlack concerning his promiſe; but the day of the Lord will come as a thief in the night," &amp;c.
<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Peter iii. 8, 9, 10.</note> Hence the conſtant revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of weeks, conſiſting of ſeven days, is an emblem of the revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of time, which will come to an end, when the world has exiſted ſeven thouſand years. And there has been a tradition among both Jews and Chriſtians, agreeable to this ſentiment.

And as far as there is any weight in them, oppoſe and overthrow the notion that the world will not come to an end, till it has exiſted three hundred and ſixty thouſand years, after the Millennium ſhall begin.</p>
               <p n="5">5. All the ends of ſuch a day of peace and proſperity, of victory, triumph and ſalvation to the church on earth, and of the ſo much celebrated reign of Chriſt with his ſaints, in this world, will be fully anſwered in a literal thouſand years, ſo far as it can be learned what they are, from ſcripture; or man can conceive them to be; as much and as fully anſwered, as they could be in hundreds of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of years, or in any ſuppoſed length of time.</p>
               <p>Satan will be as much defeated, and his kingdom and intereſt wholly deſtroyed in the world; the cauſe of wickedneſs, and evil men, will be entirely ruined and loſt, and they all baniſhed from the earth. The wiſdom, power, grace, truth and faithfulneſs of Chriſt will have a proper and glorious manifeſtation, by intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing ſuch a ſtate, and continuing it as long as is moſt for his glory, and the beſt good of his church, though it ſhall continue but a thouſand years. The church may have all the reward and enjoyment in that time, that it is proper or deſirable that it ſhould have on earth; and it may be wiſeſt and beſt, then to take it to a more perfect, happy and glorious ſtate in heaven. A thouſand years will be time enough for Chriſt to ſhow what he can do, in bringing good out of evil, and vindicating his cauſe and church, and triumphing gloriouſly over all oppoſition from earth and hell, and filling the world with his powerful preſence and kingdom, with the knowledge of the glory of the Lord; with holineſs and happineſs. There will be full opportunity in this time, to ſhow and demonſtrate, from fact and abundant experience, what is the nature, beauty and excellence of chriſtianity; that it is exactly ſuited to form the world into a ſtate of love, union and happineſs; and that all the preceding evils among mankind have been chiefly owing to ignorance or neglect of Chriſt, and the true ſpirit of chriſtianity, and oppoſition to thoſe in life or heart, or both. And this will be time enough to ſhow, that all means are ineffectual to
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:025635_0037_0FCEAC47E3460780"/>reclaim man from ſin; and that this can be effected by nothing but the ſpirit of God, poured down in plentiful effuſions; and to give a ſample and foretaſte of the beauty, happineſs and glory of the holy ſociety and redeemed church in heaven.</p>
               <p>And in this thouſand years the work of redemption, and ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may be fully accompliſhed, in the utmoſt extent and glory of it. In this time, in which the world will be ſoon filled with real chriſtians, and continue full, by conſtant propagation, to ſupply the place of thoſe who will leave the world; there will be many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands born and live on earth, to each one that had been born and lived in the preceding ſix thouſand years. So that if they who ſhall be born in that thouſand years, ſhall be all, or moſt of them, ſaved, as they will be, there will, on the whole, be many thouſands of mankind ſaved, to one that ſhall be loſt.

               <p>The only end that can be imagined would be anſwered by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting this time of the proſperity of the church in this world, is, that greater numbers of mankind might exiſt, and be ſaved. But that this is really deſirable or beſt, all things conſidered, there is not the leaſt evidence. A deſire that more of mankind ſhould be ſaved than will be ſaved, in a thouſand years of the prevalence of holineſs and ſalvation, in all the families of the earth, never could be ſatisfied: For though three hundred and ſixty thouſand years ſhould be added, and all ſhould be ſaved who lived in that time; ſtill, for the ſame reaſon that this is deſired, it will be equally de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable, and more ſo, that the time of ſalvation ſhould be lengthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out yet longer; and ſo on without end. This reaſon for making the time longer, that more may be ſaved, cannot ceaſe; and a deſire of more time, on this ground, or for this reaſon, is like the four things which Solomon mentions as never ſatisfied, and ſay not it is enough. It is moſt wiſe and beſt, that a certain number and proportion of mankind ſhould be ſaved: And God only knows what this number is, how great, and what proportion it bears to the whole human race. And no man has any reaſon to think, that this number will not be compleated within a literal thouſand years, after the Millennium commences. Nor can there be the leaſt evidence from any quarter, that it will not, unleſs there be evidence that the Millennium contains a longer time; which is the queſtion under conſideration. And it is ſuppoſed
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:025635_0038_0FCEAC4906621820"/>that no evidence of this has yet been produced, or can be at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent: And it is certain, that the ſalvation of more of mankind, were the time to be longer, is no reaſon why it ſhould be longer. But this will be beſt, and moſt infallibly decided by the event which will take place in due ſeaſon: Which perhaps cannot be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined with certainty now, or ſo that all ſhall be ſatisfied and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed in the matter. And it may not be wiſe to be very confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on either ſide of the queſtion.</p>
               <p>THE evidence has now been produced from ſcripture, that there is a time coming, in which the cauſe of Chriſt ſhall prevail in this world; and his kingdom ſpread and fill the earth, as it has never yet done; in which time, the church and people of Chriſt ſhall come to a ſtate of peace and proſperity; when the kingdom of ſatan ſhall be utterly deſtroyed; and all wicked men ſhall be put down, and caſt out of the earth, and there ſhall be none to deſtroy, hurt or oppoſe the truth and ways of Chriſt, or his people: And this happy, glorious day ſhall laſt a thouſand years.</p>
               <p>This is foretold, not by one ſingle prophecy, but is repeatedly and abundantly mentiond in the ſacred, prophetic writings, and repreſented by a variety of ſtrong expreſſions, and by different ſimilitudes, and in figurative language: And yet all perfectly a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree to point out the ſame thing. And there are many prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the ſame event, by Iſaiah, and in other parts of the Bible, which have not been particularly mentioned.</p>
               <p>Nothing has yet taken place in favour of the church of Chriſt, and in oppoſition to his enemies, which is in any meaſure anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to theſe predictions. By far the greater part of mankind have been in a ſtate of ignorance of chriſtianity, or of oppoſition to it, ever ſince the goſpel has been preached to men; and ſatan has had a greater and ſtronger kingdom on earth, than Chriſt, moſt of the time ſince his aſcenſion. And ſin, and real oppoſition to Chriſt, in principle and practice, have abounded in every age, even among nominal chriſtians. The overthrow of the Jews by the Romans, and the conſequent ſpread of chriſtianity among the Gentiles, were events favourable to the church of Chriſt, and were a pledge and type of what he will yet do, in overthrowing his enemies and delivering his church, in the latter days. And ſo was the overthrow of heathen Rome, and the ſpread and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knce of chriſtianity through all the Roman empite, in the days
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:025635_0039_0FCEAC4A80478C68"/>of the Emperor Conſtantine, in the fourth century. But this was of ſhort continuance, and within twenty years the church fell into a ſtate of great calamity, by diviſions, contentions, and he<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſies; and the empire was involved in confuſion and war. And from that time to this, the church has been in a low, afflicted ſtate. The many promiſes made to Iſrael by the prophets, of reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toration to a long abiding ſtate of obedience, holineſs and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, have not been in any meaſure fulfilled to that nation, nor to the church, including Jews and Gentiles, repreſented and typified by Iſrael, Jeruſalem, Mount Zion, &amp;c. If ſuch a day of proſperity of the church of Chriſt, comprehending Jews and Gentiles, and all nations, were not yet to come, great part of the prophecies in the Bible could have but a very low and little mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and would be in a great meaſure, if not wholly, uſeleſs: Whereas, if they be underſtood according to the moſt natural, plain import of them, they open a moſt pleaſing, wonderful ſcene, ſuited to ſupport and animate the chriſtian, and fill him with gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude and joy, on the agreeable proſpect.</p>
               <p>It appears reaſonable and deſirable, that Jeſus Chriſt, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered ſhame and reproach in this world, and was condemned and put to death as a malefactor, by men, ſhould have this reproach wiped off in the fight of all m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>, and that the cauſe in which he ſuffered and died, ſhould prevail and be victorious in this ſame world, where he ſuffered and died: That he ſhould, agreeably to ancient prophecies, be here on earth, "Exalted, and extolled, and be very high. As many were aſtoniſhed at him (his viſage was ſo marred more than any man, and his form more than the ſons of men) ſo ſhall he ſprinkle many nations, and kings ſhall ſhut their mouths at him: For that which had not been told them ſhall they ſee; and that which they had not heard, ſhall they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider. He ſhall ſee of the travail of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied. He ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong; becauſe he hath poured out his ſoul unto death; and was numbered with the tranſgreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors."

               </p>
               <p>And it appears very deſirable, that the enemies of Chriſt and his church, ſhould meet with diſappointment, be defeated and confounded in this world, and that the reproach which has been caſt upon the church ſhould be removed: That the church ſhould put on her beautiful garments, and ſhine in the true beauties of

All this is therefore predict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and promiſed. "Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee, and I will ſave her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out, and I will get them praiſe and fame in every land, where they have been put to ſhame: For I will make you a name and a praiſe among all people of the earth."

               </p>
               <p>One reaſon why this day of ſalvation is delayed ſo long after the death and reſurrection of Chriſt, doubtleſs is, that there may be proper and full opportunity to diſcover the depravity and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of man, and the inſufficiency of all means that can be uſed, or methods taken, to bring men to repentance, and a cordial ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to Chriſt, unleſs accompanied by the ſpecial, omnipotent influences of the Holy Spirit, to renew their hearts: And clearly to manifeſt the natural enmity in the hearts of mankind againſt Chriſt, and the truths of the goſpel, and their ſtrong diſpoſition, and unconquerable by all poſſible external means and advantages, to oppoſe, and pervert the goſpel, and abuſe it to the worſt pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes; that it may appear in the moſt clear and ſtriking light, how greatly and wholly depraved, and utterly loſt, men are, unleſs they be ſaved by the waſhing of regeneration, and the renewing of the Holy Ghoſt; and that the whole praiſe and glory of the ſalvation of every one, may be aſcribed to the ſovereign grace of Chriſt, and man be forever abaſed. When God has ſufficiently tried men, and uſed a variety of the moſt proper and powerful means to bring the world to repentance, and all has proved in vain, he will then pour out his ſpirit upon all, and renew their hearts, and converts will ſpring up as graſs after ſhowers of rain; and the obſtinacy of man, and the power and ſovereign grace of Chriſt, will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by all; and that men are ſaved, not by human might or power, but by the ſpirit of the Lord.

               <p>And it appears proper and wife, that this day of proſperity and ſalvation, ſhould be in the latter end of the world, in the laſt times, as this is ſuited to excite and ſupport the faith and patience of chriſtians, who live in the preceding dark and evil times; and to encourage and animate them to faithfulneſs and conſtancy, in fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Chriſt, and adherence to his cauſe, in the midſt of tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:025635_0041_0FCEAC4D8250C218"/>and trials; and this uſe is made of it in the ſcripture, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the book of Revelation. And this is ſuited to excite the prayers of chriſtians in all the preceding ages of darkneſs, affliction and ſuffering, and the prevalence of ſin, and ſatan, for the coming and kingdom of Chriſt; which he has preſcribed as the firſt and moſt important petition in the pattern of prayer which he has given. "Our Father, who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name. <hi>Thy kingdom come.</hi> Thy will be done in earth as it is in heaven." Daniel was excited and encouraged to faſt and pray for the deliverance of the people of God, from their affliction and diſtreſs in their captivity, by finding that this was foretold and promiſed by Jeremiah the Prophet.

               <p>THERE have been, and ſtill are, very different opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions, reſpecting the Millennium, and the events which will take place in that day; which are grounded chiefly on the ſix firſt verſes in the twentieth chapter of the Revelation, which paſſage has been brought into view, in the preceding ſection; but is to be more particicularly conſidered in this.</p>

Some have ſuppoſed, that this paſſage is to be taken literally, as importing that at that time, Jeſus Chriſt will come in his human nature, from heaven to earth; and ſet his kingdom up here, and reign viſibly, and perſonally, and with diſtinguiſhed glory on earth. And that the bodies of the martyrs, and other eminent chriſtians, will then be raiſed from the dead, in which they ſhall live and reign with Chriſt here on earth, a thouſand years. And ſome ſuppoſe, that all the ſaints, the true friends to God and Chriſt, who have lived before that time, will then be raiſed from the dead, and live on earth perfectly holy, during this thouſand years. And this they ſuppoſe, is meant by the firſt reſurrection. Thoſe who agree in general in this notion of the Millennium, differ with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to many circumſtances, which it is needleſs to mention here.</p>
               <p>Others have underſtood this paragraph of ſcripture, in a figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive ſenſe. That by this reign of Chriſt on earth, is not meant his coming from heaven to earth, in his human, viſible nature; but his taking to himſelf his power, and utterly overthrowing the kingdom of ſatan, and ſetting up his own kingdom in all the world, which before this had been confined to very narrow bounds; and ſubduing all hearts to a willing ſubjection, and thus reigning over all men, who ſhall then be in the world, and live in that thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years. And by "The ſouls of them which were beheaded for the witneſs of Jeſus, and for the word of God, and which had not worſhipped the beaſt, neither his image, neither had received his mark upon their foreheads, or in their hands," living again and reigning with Chriſt a thouſand years; they ſuppoſe, is not meant a literal reſurrection, or the reſurrection of their bodies, which is not aſſerted here, as there is nothing ſaid of their bodies, or of their being raiſed to lite: But that they ſhall live again and reign with Chriſt, in the revival, proſperity, reign and triumph of that cauſe and intereſt in which they lived, and for the promotion of which they died; and in whoſe death, the cauſe ſeemed in a meaſure, and for a time, to die and be loſt. And they ſhall live again in their ſucceſſors, who ſhall ariſe and ſtand up with the ſame ſpirit, and in the ſame cauſe, in which they lived and died, and fill the world and reign with Chriſt a thouſand years, agreeable to ancient prophecies. "The meek ſhall inherit the earth. And the kingdom and dominion, and the greatneſs of the kingdom under the whole heaven, ſhall be given to the people of the ſaints of the Moſt High; whoſe kingdom is an everlaſting kingdom,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:025635_0043_0FCEAC50846E0C68"/>and all dominions ſhall ſerve him." And they ſuppoſe, that this revival of the truths and cauſe of Chriſt, by the numerous inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the earth, riſing up to a new and holy life, and filling the world with holineſs and happineſs, is that which is here called the <hi>firſt reſurrection,</hi> in diſtinction from the ſecond, which will conſiſt in the reſurrection of the body; whereas this is a ſpiritual reſurrec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; a reſurrection of the truths and cauſe of Chriſt, which had been in a great degree, dead and loſt; and a reſurrection of the ſouls of men, by the renovation of the Holy Ghoſt.</p>
               <p>That this important paſſage of ſcripture, is to be underſtood in the figurative ſenſe, laſt mentioned, is very probable, if not certain. And the following conſiderations are thought ſufficient to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Moſt, if not all the prophecies in this book, are delivered in figurative language, referring to types and events recorded in the Old Teſtament; and in imitation of the language of the ancient Prophets. And this was proper and even neceſſary in the beſt manner to anſwer the ends of prophecy, as might eaſily be ſhown, were it neceſſary. The firſt part of this paſſage, all muſt allow, is figurative. Satan cannot be bound with a literal, material chain. The key, the great chain, and the ſeal, cannot be underſtood liter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally. The whole is a figure, and can mean no more than that when the time of the Millennium arrives, or rather previous to it, Jeſus Chriſt will lay effectual reſtraints on ſatan, ſo that his power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and prevailing influence by which he has before deceived and deſtroyed a great part of mankind, ſhall be wholly taken from him, for a thouſand years. And it is moſt natural to underſtand the other part of the deſcription of this remarkable event to be repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in the ſame <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>igurative language; as the whole is a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of one ſcene; eſpecially, ſince no reaſon can be given why it ſhould not be underſtood ſo: And there are reaſons againſt tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it in a literal ſenſe, which will be mentioned in the following particulars.</p>
               <p n="2">2. To ſuppoſe that Chriſt ſhall come in his human nature to this earth, and live here in his whole perſon viſibly a thouſand years, before the day of judgment, appears to be contrary to ſeveral paſſages of ſcripture.</p>
               <p>The coming of Chriſt, and his appearing at the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in his human nature, is ſaid to be his <hi>ſecond</hi> appearance, anſwering to his <hi>firſt</hi> appearance in his human nature on earth,
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:025635_0044_0FCEAC53321A1490"/>from his birth to his aſcenſion into heaven, which was paſt. "And as it is appointed unto men once to die, but after this the judgment: So Chriſt was once offered to bear the ſins of many; and unto them who look for him ſhall he appear the <hi>ſecond time,</hi> without ſin, unto ſalvation."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. ix. 27, 28.</note> The appearance here ſpoken of, is the appearance of Chriſt at the day of judgment, to complete the ſalvation of his church. This could not be his appearing the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond time, were he thus to appear, and to be bodily preſent in his human nature on earth, in the time of the Millennium, which is to take place before the day of judgment. The coming of Chriſt, does not always intend his coming viſibly in his human nature; but he is ſaid to come, when he deſtroyed the temple and nation of the Jews, and appeared in favour of his church. So his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of heathen Rome, and delivering his church from that perſecuting power, was an inſtance of his coming. And he will, in the ſame way, come to deſtroy antichriſt, and the kingdom of ſatan in the world, and introduce the Millennium; and in theſe inſtances, and others, he may be ſaid to appear. But his coming to judgment, and appearing to complete the final deſtruction of all his enemies, and to perfect the ſalvation of his church, is his laſt coming and appearance. And though this will not be his ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond appearance and coming, in the ſenſe now mentioned, and with reference to thoſe inſtances of his coming; yet, as he will then come and appear viſibly in his human nature; this will be his ſecond coming and appearance in this way and manner, having never appeared on earth in his human nature more than once be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, or ſince his firſt aſcenſion to heaven, after his incarnation. Therefore, when the final judgment ſhall take place, Chriſt is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſented as being revealed, and coming from heaven, and this is often called, by way of eminence, his <hi>appearing;</hi> meaning his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing and coming from heaven in viſible ſplendor and glory, in his whole perſon, in both natures, divine and human. But if he were here on earth, viſible in his human nature, and reigning in his glorified body, during the Millennium; he would be already here to attend the laſt judgment, and he could not be properly ſaid to come from heaven, and to be revealed from heaven, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe this was done a thouſand years before. Therefore, that Chriſt ſhould come from heaven, and appear and reign in his hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature and preſence before the day of judgment, ſeems to be contrary to the following ſcriptures: "For the Lord himſelf
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:025635_0045_0FCEAC5440F77B78"/>ſhall <hi>deſcend from heaven</hi> with a ſhout, with the voice of the arch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>angel, and with the trump of God: And the dead in Chriſt ſhall riſe firſt. When the Lord Jeſus ſhall be <hi>revealed from heaven,</hi> with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them that know not God, &amp;c. When he <hi>ſhall come</hi> to be glorified in his ſaints."
<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Theſſ. iv. 16. 2 Theſſ. i. 7, 8, 10.</note> This is evidently his appearing the ſecond time, for the ſalvation of all them that look for him; and were he on earth be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore this, in the human nature, during the time of the Millenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, how could he be ſaid to be <hi>revealed,</hi> to <hi>deſcend</hi> and <hi>come from</hi> heaven to judge the world?</p>
               <p n="3">3. As it ſeems to be contrary to the above mentioned ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures to ſuppoſe, that Chriſt will appear on earth, and reign a thouſand years in his human nature; ſo it appears contrary to all reaſon. Jeſus Chriſt is now on the throne of the univerſe, having all power in heaven and earth given to him as God-man, and Redeemer, being made head over all things to the church. He is in the moſt proper, agreeable, and convenient ſituation to gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern the world, and take care of his church. It does not appear agreeable to his ſtation and office, as king and head over all things, for him to deſcend in the human nature, and erect a throne on earth; which, ſo far as can be conceived, would be no advantage to his perſon, deſign and work; but very much to the contrary. He is gone to heaven in the human nature, that he might reign there, till his enemies are made his footſtool, and all things ſhall be ſubdued under him. And his church on earth will enjoy him to as great a degree, and as much advantage, as if he were perſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on earth in the human nature, and more; and will have as great enjoyment of his preſence. He is now in the beſt ſituation to be adored and worſhipped by his church on earth. Though they now do not ſee him, yet believing and loving him, they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice with joy unſpeakable and full of glory. And it would not tend to increaſe this faith, love and joy, to have him come from heaven, and live in ſome place on earth, in his human nature; but the contrary: For but few, compared with the whole inhabitants of the world, could have acceſs to him, or ſee him more than they now do. And when the human nature is in heaven, all may equally have acceſs to him, love and worſhip him. His church and kingdom on earth will be as happy, ſplendid and glorious, as if he were on earth, as he is now in heaven, and much more ſo; for theſe will conſiſt in his ſpiritual preſence and influence, which
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:025635_0046_0FCEAC55CACF8C30"/>may be as great while his human nature is in heaven, as if it were on earth; and in their holy conformity to Chriſt, which would not be increaſed by his being in that ſenſe on earth. It hence ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in no reſpect advantageous or deſirable, but the contrary, that Jeſus Chriſt ſhould come perſonally in the human nature from heaven to earth, to reign here with his church, or that he ſhould thus appear, till he ſhall come to judgment. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unreaſonable to expect or ſuppoſe he will thus come, unleſs it were expreſsly aſſerted in ſcripture, which it certainly is not; but there are ſome, if not many paſſages, which ſeem to be inconſiſtent with it.</p>
               <p>It may be proper to obſerve here, that the queſtion reſpecting the manner in which Chriſt will reign on earth in the Millennium, has no concern with the queſtion concerning the literal or figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive meaning of this paſſage, as the former does not depend upon the latter: For no man will ſuppoſe, that Chriſt's reigning on earth, is to be underſtood in a figurative ſenſe. If he ſhall reign on earth in the hearts of men, by their voluntary ſubjection to him, he will reign as literally, as if he were preſent on earth in his humanity. The queſtion, whether this paſſage is to be underſtood literally or figuratively, reſpects the ſouls of them that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed for the witneſs of Jeſus, &amp;c. their living and reigning with Chriſt a thouſand years. This therefore leads to other obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p n="4">4. The Apoſtle Paul in his writings, does not appear to expect to have his body raiſed from the dead to live here on earth again, after he died; or ſay any thing to lead the chriſtians of this day to expect any ſuch thing, but the contrary.</p>
               <p>He ſays, "It is appointed unto man once to die, but after this the judgment." And leads chriſtians to look forward to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond coming of Chriſt, when he will come to judgment, as the next great event that will immediately reſpect them; which ſeems to be inconſiſtent with the ſaints having their bodies raiſed, and living in this world again, a thouſand years before the day of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. He addreſſes chriſtians in the following words, "If ye then be riſen with Chriſt, ſeek thoſe things which are above, where Chriſt ſitteth on the right hand of God. Set your affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on things above, not on things on earth. For ye are dead, and your life is hid with Chriſt in God. When Chriſt, who is
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:025635_0047_0FCEAC57FB22BF88"/>our life, ſhall appear, then ſhall ye alſo appear with him in glory."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Col. iii. 1, 2, 3, 4.</note> He directs them to expect and ſeek enjoyment in heaven where Chriſt is; and not to expect that he will leave his throne there, till he ſhall appear the ſecond time, to receive his ſaints to glory in heaven. For appearing with Chriſt in glory, means, appearing with him in heaven, as that is the place of glory, where the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed are brought to be glorified, to be where Chriſt is, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold his glory. The Apoſtle Peter, ſpeaking of the diſſolution of the heavens and earth, ſays, "Nevertheleſs we, according to his promiſe, look for new heavens and a new earth, wherein dwelleth righteouſneſs."
<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Pet. iii. 13.</note> Some have ſuppoſed, that this is the Millenni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um ſtate, which ſhall take place after the general conflagration, by which the earth will be renewed; in which a perfectly holy and happy ſtate ſhall commence, to which all the ſaints who had died ſhall be raiſed, &amp;c. But ſuch a notion cannot be reconciled to other paſſages of ſcripture, in which, as has been obſerved, the Millennium is repreſented as taking place before the general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flagration and the day of judgment. And after theſe are over, and the wicked are caſt into endleſs puniſhment,
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rev. 20.</note> the Apoſtle John ſays, "And I ſay a new heaven and a new earth: For the firſt heaven and the firſt earth were paſſed away; and there was no more ſea."
<note n="§" place="bottom">Chap. xxi. 1.</note> By which the heavenly ſtate is chiefly if not wholly meant, where redemption and the church will be perfected. By the new heaven and new earth, is meant the work of redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the church redeemed by Chriſt. This is the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, infinitely ſuperiour to the old creation, the natural world, and more important, excellent and durable; of which the latter is a faint type or ſhadow.</p>
               <p>The renovation of the hearts of men, by the Spirit of God, by which they become true chriſtians, is in ſcripture called a new creature, or as the original words <gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap> may as well be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered, <hi>a new creation.</hi> "Therefore, if any man be in Chriſt, he is a new creature: Old things are paſt away, behold, all things are become new."
<note n="‖" place="bottom">2 Cor. v. 17.</note> "For in Chriſt Jeſus, neither circumciſion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaileth any thing, nor uncircumciſion, but a new creature.
<note n="¶" place="bottom">Gal. vi. 15.</note>"— Therefore, every true member of the church belongs to the new creation, and is part of it; and this new creation of the new heaven and new earth, goes on and makes advances, as the church is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:025635_0048_0FCEAC5980431F98"/>and riſes to a ſtate of greater proſperity, and proceeds to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards perfection.</p>
               <p>The new heavens, and new earth, the redeemed church of Chriſt, will be brought to a very happy and glorious ſtate in the Millennium, and greater advantages will be made then in this new creation, than were ever made before. Therefore, to this event, the following prophecy of Iſaiah, does chiefly refer, if not wholly. "For behold, I create new heavens, and a new earth. And the former ſhall not be remembered, nor come into mind. But be you glad and rejoice forever, in that which I create: For behold, I create Jeruſalem a rejoicing, and her people a joy."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. lxv. 17, 18.</note> It appears from the preceding and following context, that this prophecy refers to the Millennium, in which the new creation, the church of Chriſt, will come to the moſt perfect and happy ſtate to which it will be brought in this world; from which it will paſs to a perfect ſtate, and be completely finiſhed, after the general reſurrection and judgment. Then the old creation, the heavens and the earth ſhall paſs away, and be burnt up, and the new crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhall be finiſhed, and brought to a moſt perfect, beautiful, happy and glorious ſtate. To the new heaven and new earth, thus completed, wherein that righteouſneſs or true holineſs, which is the beauty, happineſs and glory of the new creation, will <hi>dwell,</hi> i. e. continue and flouriſh forever, the Apoſtles Peter and John have chief reference in their words, which have been tranſcribed above.</p>
               <p n="5">5. It does not appear deſirable, or to be any advantage to the departed faints, or to the church of Chriſt on earth, to have the bodies of all who have died before the Millennium, raiſed from their graves, and come to live a thouſand years in this world, before the general reſurrection. They are now perfectly holy and happy; and ſo far as can be conceived, it would be no addition, but a diminution to their happineſs, to come and live in this world, in the body, to eat and drink, and partake of the enjoyments of the world. This would be a degradation, which on no account can be deſirable to the ſpirits of the juſt, now made perfect in heaven. And it would be no advance in the work of redemption, which is then to be carried on in a greater degree, than ever before. Nor would this be any advantage to the church, in that happy ſtate, to which it will then be brought; but the contrary, as they would take up that room in the world, which will be then wanted
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:025635_0049_0FCEAC5B23AA7670"/>for thoſe who will be born in that day. And the ſpirits of the juſt could not know or enjoy ſo much of the proſperity and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the church, in the ſalvation of men, were they to live in bodies on earth, in that time. The inhabitants of heaven have a more particular and extenſive knowledge, of what takes place in favour of the church on earth, than any in this world have, or than they could have, were they to come and live here. They know of every converſion that takes place in this world; and they muſt have the knowledge of the ſtate of the church on earth, and of every event which comes to paſs in favour of it, and ſee the whole of its proſperity. And they have great joy in every thing of this kind. "There is joy in heaven, in preſence of the angels of God, over one ſinner that repenteth." How greatly will the happineſs and joy in heaven be increaſed, when all the inhabitants of the world ſhall be converted to Chriſt, and the church of Chriſt ſhall fill the earth, and appear in the beauty of holineſs! Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to this, the inhabitants of heaven are repreſented as greatly rejoicing in the proſperity of the church on earth, and the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of all her enemies. "Rejoice over her, thou heaven, and ye holy Apoſtles and Prophets; for God hath avenged you on her. And I heard a great voice of much people in heaven, ſaying, Hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lelujah; ſalvation, and glory, and honour, and power unto the Lord our God; for he hath judged the great whore, &amp;c. Let us be glad and rejoice, and give honour to him; for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and his wife hath made herſelf ready."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xviii. 10. xix. 1—7.</note>— Surely none will deſire to leave that place of knowledge, light and joy, and come and be contined in the body in this world, which will be darkneſs and ſolitary, compared with that: Such a change of place could be no privilege or reward; but rather a calamity.

               <p n="6">6. There is nothing expreſsly ſaid of the reſurrection of the body in this paſſage. The Apoſtle John ſaw the <hi>ſouls</hi> of them which were beheaded for the witneſs of Jeſus, &amp;c. and they lived and reigned with Chriſt. The reſurrection of the body, is no where expreſſed in ſcripture, by the ſoul's living. And as there is noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſaid of the body, and he only ſaw their ſouls to live, this does not appear to be a proper expreſſion, to denote the reſurrection of the body, and their living in that. This therefore does not ſeem
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:025635_0050_0FCEAC5C9427D9E0"/>to be the natural meaning of the words; and certainly is not the <hi>neceſſary</hi> meaning. We are therefore warranted to look for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther meaning, and to acquieſce in it, if one can be found, which is more eaſy and natural, and more agreeable to the whole paſſage, and to the ſcripture in general. Therefore,</p>
               <p n="7">7. The moſt eaſy and probable meaning is, that the ſouls of the martyrs, and all the faithful followers of Chriſt, who have lived in the world, and have died before the Millennium ſhall commence, ſhall revive and live again, in their ſucceſſors, who ſhall riſe up in the ſame ſpirit, and in the ſame character, in which they lived and died; and in the revival and flouriſhing of that cauſe which they eſpouſed, and ſpent their lives in promoting it, which cauſe ſhall appear to be almoſt loſt and dead, previous to the intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of that glorious day. This is therefore a ſpiritual reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, by which all the inhabitants of the world will be made ſpiritually alive, where ſpiritual death before had reigned; and they ſhall appear in the ſpirit and power of thoſe martyrs and holy men, who had before lived in the world, and who ſhall live again, in theſe their ſucceſſors, and in the revival of their cauſe, and in the reſurrection of the church, from the very low ſtate, in which it had been before the Millennium, to a ſtate of great proſperity and glory.</p>
               <p>This is agreeable to the way of repreſenting things in ſcripture, in other inſtances. John the baptiſt was Elijah, becauſe he roſe in the ſpirit of Elijah, and promoted the ſame cauſe in which Elijah lived and died; and Elijah revived and lived in John the baptiſt, becauſe he went before Chriſt, in the ſpirit and power of Elijah.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke i. 27.</note> Therefore Chriſt ſays of John, "This is Elijah who was to come."

               </p>
               <p>It is alſo to be obſerved, that the revival and reſtoration of the church to a ſtate of proſperity, from a dark, low ſtate, is repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a reſurrection to life, or as life from the dead. "Thy dead men ſhall live, together with my d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>In the Millennium, there will be a ſpiritual reſurrection, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the ſouls of the whole church on earth, and in heaven. All nations will be converted, and the world will be filled with ſpiritual life, as it never was before; and this will be a general reſurrection of the ſouls of men. This was repreſented in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning prodigal. The father ſays, "This my ſon was dead, and is alive." And the Apoſtle Paul ſpeaks of chriſtians as raiſed from the dead to life. "But God, who is rich in mercy, for the great love wherewith he loved us, even when we were dead in ſins, hath quickened us together with Chriſt."

<note n="‡" place="bottom">Col. iii. 1.</note> And this will be a moſt remarkable reſurrection of the church on earth from a low, dark, afflicted ſtate, to a ſtate of great life and joy. It will be multiplied to an exceeding great army, which will cover the face of the earth.

               <p>This is the firſt reſurrection, in which all they who have a part are bleſſed and holy. "Bleſſed and holy is he who hath part in the firſt reſurrection: On ſuch the ſecond death hath no power." It is implied that <hi>they only</hi> are bleſſed and holy, who ſhare in this reſurrection; and therefore that all the redeemed in heaven and earth, who are bleſſed and holy, are the ſubjects of it, or have part in it. All who have been or ſhall be raiſed from death to ſpiritual life, have by this, a part in this firſt reſurrection; and they, and they only, ſhall eſcape the ſecond death. This is a farther evidence that this firſt reſurrection is a ſpiritual reſurrection, a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the ſoul; for if it were a literal reſurrection of the body, no one would think it would include all the happy and ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, all that ſhall be ſaved. The ſecond reſurrection is to be the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection of the body, in which all ſhall have part, both the holy
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:025635_0052_0FCEAC5F8680C3B0"/>and the unholy, the bleſſed and the miſerable; which is to take place after the firſt reſurrection is over, and the Millennium is ended, and after the riſe and deſtruction of God and Magog; when the day of judgment ſhall come on, of which there is an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count in the latter part of this chapter. "And I ſaw the dead, ſmall and great, ſtand before God. And the ſea gave up the dead which were in it: And death and hell delivered up the dead which were in them: And they were judged every man accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to their works." "But the reſt of the dead lived not again until the thouſand years were finiſhed." The <hi>reſt of the dead,</hi> are all the dead which have no part in the firſt reſurrection; that is, are not holy, and partakers of ſpiritual life. This includes all the wicked who ſhall have lived, and ſhall die before the Millennium, the laſt of which will be ſlain, and ſwept off the earth previous to the Millennium, and in order to introduce it, of which there is a repreſentation in the words immediately preceding the paſſage un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der conſideration. "And <hi>the reſt</hi> were ſlain with the ſword of him that ſat upon the horſe, which ſword proceeded out of his mouth, and all the fowls were filled with their fleſh."

During this thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years, the reſt of the dead, all the antichriſtian party, and the wicked enemies of Chriſt, who lived and died in the cauſe of ſatan, do not live again: They will have no ſucceſſors on earth, who ſhall riſe in their ſpirit, and eſpouſe and promote their cauſe; but this will be wholly run down and loſt, till the thouſand years ſhall be ended: And then they ſhall live again a ſhort time in their ſucceſſors, Gog and Magog, who ſhall ariſe in their ſpirit and cauſe, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>That this prophecy reſpects all nations, and the whole of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind who ſhall live in the world in that thouſand years, is evident, in that the binding of ſatan reſpects them all. "That he ſhould deceive the nations no more, till the thouſand years ſhould be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled." And this anſwers to a prophecy in Iſaiah. "And he will deſtroy in this mountain, the face of the covering caſt over <hi>all people,</hi> and the vail that is ſpread over <hi>all nations.</hi>"
<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſaiah xxv. 7.</note> All nations, the world of mankind therefore, who ſhall then live on the earth, will have part in the firſt reſurrection. And this warrants the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication of all the prophecies which have been mentioned in the preceding ſection, and others of the ſame tenor, to this time. And there is good reaſon to believe, that this prophecy, in the firſt ſix verſes of the twentieth chapter of the Revelation, is expreſſed in language beſt ſuited to anſwer the end of it, if it be underſtood as it has been now explained. The meaning is as obvious and plain, as is deſirable and proper that of prophecy ſhould be, when compared with other prophecies. And it is in the beſt manner ſuited to ſupport and comfort the followers of Chriſt, who live before that time; and to animate them to faithfulneſs, conſtancy and patience, under all their ſufferings in this cauſe, while the wicked proſper and triumph, and ſatan reigns in the world, which is one ſpecial end of this revelation. Here they are taught, that an end is to come to the afflictions of the church, and to the triumph of all her enemies. That ſatan's kingdom on earth ſhall come to an end, and the church ſhall riſe and ſpread, and fill the world; that the cauſe in which they labour and ſuffer ſhall be virtuous, and that all who ſuffer in this cauſe, and who are faithful to Chriſt, ſhall live to ſee this happy, glorious day, and have a large ſhare in it, in proportion to the degree and length of their ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:025635_0054_0FCEAC6288D79878"/>labours, and perſevering patience and fidelity, in the cauſe of Chriſt and his church.</p>
               <p>THE way is now prepared, to conſider and ſhow more particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly, in what the happineſs and glory of the Millennium will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt; and what particular circumſtances will attend the church at that day: What is revealed concerning this by expreſs prophecies, and what is implied in them, or may be deduced as conſequences from what is expreſsly declared. It will be no wonder if ſome miſtakes ſhould be made on this point; but it is hoped if there ſhould be any, they will not be very hurtful: And it is appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended that the greateſt error will be in falling ſhort, and not coming up to the reality, in the deſcription of the happineſs and glory of that day; for doubtleſs, our ideas of theſe, when raiſed to the higheſt of which we are at preſent capable, fall vaſtly ſhort of the truth. There is good reaſon to conclude, however, that the church, and chriſtians, will not be perfectly holy in that day; but that every one will be attended with a degree of ſinful imperfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, while in the body, however great may be his attainments and advantages in knowledge and holineſs. Doubtleſs the inſpired declarations, that "There is no man which ſinneth not—There is not a juſt man upon earth, that doeth good and ſinneth not— That if any who profeſſes to be a chriſtian, ſay he hath no ſin, he deceiveth himſelf, and the truth is not in him," will remain true to the end of the world, even in the Millennium; and there will be no perfection on this ſide heaven. The apoſtacy which will take place at the end of the Millennium, can be better ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, on the ſuppoſition that the ſaints will not be perfect in that time, and ſeems to ſuppoſe it. Though they may, and doubtleſs will, have vaſtly higher degrees of light and holineſs, than any ſhall have before that time; yet they will be far from being wholly without ſin.</p>
               <p>It is moſt probable, that every individual perſon who ſhall then live will be a real chriſtian; and all will doubtleſs be members of the church, in that day. That is the time when "all ſhall know the Lord, from the leaſt to the greateſt." God ſays to his church, ſpeaking of that day, "Thy people alſo ſhall be all righteous."

This will be the peculiar glory, and the ſource of the happineſs of the Millennium. The Prophet Zechariah, ſpeaking of that day, ſays, "In that day, ſhall there be upon the bells of the horſes, HOLI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NESS UNTO THE LORD; and the pots of the Lord's houſe ſhall be like the bowls before the altar.

The prophecies of ſcripture which reſpect the Millennium, repreſent it in this light. God, ſpeaking by Iſaiah of that time, ſays, "I will pour water upon him that is thirſty, and floods upon the dry ground: I will pour my ſpirit upon thy ſeed, and my bleſſing upon thine

               <p n="2">II. THERE will be a great increaſe of light and knowledge to a degree vaſtly beyond what has been before. This is indeed im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in the great degree of holineſs, which has been mentioned. For knowledge, mental light, and holineſs, are inſeparably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected; and are, in ſome reſpects, the ſame. Holineſs is true light and diſcerning, ſo far as it depends upon a right taſte, and conſiſts in it; and it is a thirſt after every kind and degree of uſeful knowledge; and this deſire and thirſt for knowledge, will be great and ſtrong, in proportion to the degree of holineſs exerciſed: And forms the mind to conſtant attention, and to make ſwift ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances in underſtanding and knowledge; and becomes a ſtrong guard againſt miſtakes, error and deluſion. Therefore, a time of eminent holineſs, muſt be a time of proportionably great light and knowledge. This is the repreſentation which the ſcripture gives of that time. The end of binding ſatan, and caſting him into the bottomleſs pit, is ſaid to be, "That he ſhould deceive the nations no more, till the thouſand years ſhould be fulfilled." This will put an end to the darkneſs, and multiplicity of ſtrong deluſions, which do prevail, and will prevail, till that time, by which ſatan ſupports and promotes his intereſt and kingdom among men.— Then "The face of the covering caſt over all people, and the vail ſpread over all nations, ſhall be taken away and deſtroyed:"

<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. xxxii. 3, 4.</note> The ſuperior light and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of that day, is metaphorically repreſented in the following words: "Moreover, the light of the moon ſhall be as the light of the ſun, and the light of the ſun ſhall be ſeven fold, as the light of ſeven days, in the day that the Lord bindeth up the breach of his people, and healeth the ſtroke of their wound."

               </p>
               <p>The holy ſcriptures will then be attended to by all, and ſtudied with care, meekneſs, humility and uprightneſs of heart, earneſtly deſiring to underſtand them, and know the truth; and the truths they contain will be received with a high reliſh and delight: And the Bible will be much better underſtood, than ever before. Many things expreſſed or implied in the ſcripture, which are now over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked and diſregarded, will then be diſcovered, and appear im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant and excellent; and thoſe things which now appear intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate and unintelligible, will then appear plain and eaſy. Then public teachers will be eminently burning and ſhining lights; apt to teach; ſcribes well inſtructed into the things of the kingdom of heaven, who will bring out of their treaſures, things new and old: And the hearers will be all attention, and receive the truth in the love of it, into honeſt and good hearts; and light and knowledge will conſtantly increaſe. The converſation of friends and neighbours, when they meet, will be full of inſtruction, and they will aſſiſt each other in their inquiries after the truth, and in purſuit of knowledge. Parents will be able and diſpoſed to inſtruct their children, as ſoon as they are capable of learning; and they will early underſtand what are the great and leading truths which are revealed in the Bible, and the duties and inſtitutions there preſcribed. And from their childhood they will know and under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand the holy ſcriptures, by which they will grow in underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and wiſdom; and will ſoon know more than the greateſt and beſt divines have known in ages before. And a happy foundation will be laid for great advances in knowledge and uſefulneſs to the end of life. Agreeable to this, the ſcripture, ſpeaking of that day, ſays, "There ſhall be no more thence (i. e. in the church) an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:025635_0058_0FCEAC688E2ED430"/>of days, nor an old man that hath not filled his days; for the child ſhall die an hundred years old."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſai. lxv. 20.</note> "An infant of days," is an <hi>old infant.</hi> That is, an old man who is an infant in knowledge, underſtanding and diſcretion. Many ſuch aged infants have been, and ſtill are to be found. In that day all ſhall make advances in true knowledge, diſcretion and wiſdom, in ſome proportion to their years. "Nor an old man that hath not filled his days." That is, an old man who has not improved in knowledge and uſefulneſs and every good attainment, according to his age. "For a child ſhall die an hundred years old." That is, children in years ſhall then make ſuch early progreſs in knowledge, and in religion, and in all excellent and uſeful attainments, that they ſhall equal, if not ſurpaſs, the higheſt attainments in theſe things, of the oldeſt men who have lived in former ages.</p>
               <p>They will then have every deſirable advantage and opportunity to get knowledge. They will all be engaged in the ſame purſuit, and give all the aid and aſſiſtance to each other, in their power.— They will all have ſufficient leiſure to purſue and acquire learning of every kind, that will be beneficial to themſelves and to ſociety; eſpecially knowledge of divinity. And great advances will be made in all arts and ſciences, and in every uſeful branch of know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, which tends to promote the ſpiritual and eternal good of men, or their convenience and comfort in this life.</p>
               <p n="3">III. IT will be a time of univerſal peace, love and general and cordial friendſhip. War and all ſtrife and contention ſhall then ceaſe, and be ſucceeded by mutual love, friendſhip and benificence. Thoſe luſts of men, which originate in ſelf love, or ſelfiſhneſs, which produce all the wars and ſtrifes among men, ſhall be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued and mortified, and yield to that diſintereſted benevolence, that heavenly wiſdom, which is peaceable, gentle and eaſy to be intreated. This will effectually put an end to war, as the ſcripture teaches. "And he ſhall judge among the nations, and ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buke many people: And they ſhall beat their ſwords into plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares, and their ſpears into pruning hooks: Nation ſhall not lift up ſword againſt nation, neither ſhall they learn war any more. And my people ſhall dwell in a peaceable habitation, and in ſure dwellings, and in quiet reſting places."
<note n="†" place="bottom">Iſai. ii. 4. xxxii. 18.</note> The whole world of mankind will be united as one family, wiſely ſeeking the good of

"The meek ſhall inherit the earth, and ſhall delight themſelves in the abund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of peace." This change, which ſhall then take place, in which men, who were in ages before, like ſavage beaſts, injurious, cruel, revengeful and deſtructive to each other, ſhall lay aſide all this, and become harmleſs, humble and benevolent, is ſet in a ſtriking, beautiful light in prophecies, repreſenting it by the moſt fierce and cruel beaſts of prey, changing their nature, and living quietly with thoſe creatures which they uſed to deſtroy; and ſo tame and pliable that a little child might lead them; and by the moſt venemous creatures and inſects becoming harmleſs, ſo that a child might play with them without any danger of being hurt. Iſaiah, ſpeaking of that day, ſays, "The wolf ſhall dwell with the lamb, and the leopard ſhall lie down with the kid; and the calf, and the young lion, and the fatling together, and a little child ſhall lead them. And the cow and the bear ſhall feed; their young ones ſhall lie down together: And the lion ſhall eat ſtraw, like the ox.

               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. IN that day, men will not only be united in peace and love, as brethren; but will agree in ſentiments, reſpecting the doctrines and truth contained in the Bible, and the religious inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions and practice, which are there preſcribed.</p>
               <p>Profeſſing chriſtians have been from the beginning of chriſtianity to this day, greatly divided, and have oppoſed each other in their religious ſentiments and practices; and are now divided into vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous parties, ſects and denominations, while all appeal to divine revelation, and profeſs to take their ſentiments and practices from that.</p>
               <p>It has been often ſaid by ſome profeſſing chriſtians, and is a ſentiment which appears to be ſpreading at this day, That differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in religious ſentiments, and in attendance on the inſtitutions of the goſpel, and modes of worſhip, is attended with no incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, but is rather deſirable, and advantageous; and by this variety, chriſtianity is rendered more agreeable and beautiful.
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:025635_0060_0FCEAC6BB5FF2E60"/>That it is impoſſible that all men, whoſe capacities and genius are ſo different and various, and their minds, and way of thinking and conception are naturally ſo far from being alike, ſhould ever be brought to think alike, and embrace the ſame religious ſentiments. That this difference in man's belief and ſentiment cannot be criminal; for men are no more obliged to think alike, than they are to look alike, and have the ſame bodily features and ſtature. All the union that is required, or that can take place, is that of kind affection, love and charity.</p>
               <p>But ſuch ſentiments as theſe are not agreeable to reaſon or ſcripture. Error in judgment and ſentiment, eſpecially in things of a moral nature, is always wrong; and does not conſiſt or originate merely in any defect of the moral faculties of the mind; but is of a moral nature, in which the taſte, affection, or inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart is concerned; and therefore is always, in every degree of it, morally wrong, and more or leſs criminal. Were the moral faculties of the mind, were the heart, perfectly right, man would not be capable of error, or of judging wrong, or mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any miſtake, eſpecially in things of religion. The natural faculties of the mind, of perception and underſtanding or reaſon, conſidered as ſeparate from the inclination or will, do not lead, and have no tendency in themſelves, to judge wrong, or contrary to the truth of things. To do ſo, is to judge without evidence, and contrary to it, which the mind never would or could do, were not the inclination or heart concerned in it, ſo as to have influence, which muſt be a wrong inclination, and contrary to the truth, and to evidence; and therefore is morally wrong, or criminal.</p>
               <p>Therefore, all the miſtakes and wrong opinions which men en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain, reſpecting the doctrines, inſtitutions and duties revealed in the Bible, are criminal, and of a bad tendency. They muſt be ſo, as they are contrary to man's obligation and duty to believe all revealed truth; and are wholly owing to a wrong bias or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, or the depravity and corruption of the heart. What God has revealed in his word, he has declared to man, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by him, and believed to be the truth; of which he has given ſufficient evidence. And the man who does not believe what God has clearly revealed, and of which he has given ſufficient evidence, even all that can be reaſonably deſired, does abuſe and pervert his own underſtanding, and ſhuts his eyes againſt the truth, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes to receive the teſtimony which God has given. And who will ſay there is no crime in this!</p>

Since therefore, all miſtakes and errors, contrary to the truths made known in the Bible, are criminal, and owing to the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the heart of man, then perfect holineſs will exclude all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>As there is but "one Lord, one faith, and one baptiſm," ſo in that day men will be united in the belief and profeſſion of this one faith, in the ſyſtem of doctrines revealed in the Bible, which then will appear plain, and with the cleareſt evidence to all. And they will have one common Lord, will underſtand, and obey all the commands of Chriſt; and they will know what are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions and ordinances which Chriſt has appointed, which are all implied in baptiſm: They will underſtand what is the import of this, and implied in it, and be united in ſentiments and practice, ſo as to form a beautiful, happy union and harmony; which will put an end to the variety and oppoſition of opinions, and practices, which now divide profeſſing chriſtians into ſo many ſects, parties and denominations. The whole church, with all the members of it, which will fill the earth, and include all mankind then living, will in that day, come to that to which the goſpel tends, and is deſigned to bring it: It will "Come in <hi>the unity of the ſaith,</hi> and of the knowledge of the Son of God, unto a perfect man, unto the meaſure of the ſtature of the fulneſs of Chriſt: That they ſhall be no more children, toſſed to and fro, and carried about with every wind of doctrine, by the ſleight of men, and the cunning craftineſs, whereby they lie in wait to deceive: But ſpeaking the truth in love, ſhall grow up into him in all things, which is the head, even Chriſt."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Eph. iv. 13, 14, 15.</note> Then, agreeable to the wiſh and injunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Apoſtle Paul, chriſtians will "all ſpeak the ſame thing, and there will be no diviſions among them; but will be perfectly joined together in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgment."
<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Cor. i. 10.</note> Then the inventions and preſcriptions of men, both in doctrines and modes of worſhip, and in chriſtian practice, will be aboliſhed and ceaſe. The Bible will be then underſtood, and be found a

But the moſt, and perhaps all, will be much diſappointed in this expectation; eſpecially with regard to the different modes of worſhip, and prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes relating to diſcipline, and the ordinances of the goſpel. When the church comes to be built up in that day, and put on her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful garments, it will doubtleſs be different from any thing which now takes place; and what church and particular denomination is now neareſt the truth, and the church which will exiſt at that time, muſt be left to be decided by the event.

                  </gap> this is true, in a peculiar ſenſe and degree, in the caſe before us. There can be no proper, cordial, religious union among profeſſing chriſtians, who wholly differ and oppoſe each other in their opinion, reſpecting the truths and doctrines of the goſpel. And agreement in ſentiment, and in the knowledge and belief of the truth, is eſſential to the moſt happy chriſtian union and friendſhip. To him who loves the truth, error in others is diſagreeable and hateful, and that in proportion to the degree of his love of the truth, and pleaſure in it. Therefore, chriſtians love one another <hi>in the truth,</hi> as the Apoſtles and primi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive chriſtians did. "The Elder, unto the well beloved Gaius, whom I love in the truth."
<note n="*" place="bottom">3 John, verſe 1.</note> Where there is no agreement and union in ſentiment, and belief of the truth, there is no foundation for chriſtian love and friendſhip. Love, without any regard to truth, is not chriſtian love. In this ſenſe, the knowledge and belief of the truth, and chriſtian love, cannot be ſeparated: And where there is no knowledge and belief of the truths of the goſpel, and agreement in ſentiment, there can be no union of heart, and true chriſtian love and friendſhip.
<note n="†" place="bottom">They who talk of chriſtian union, love and charity, where there is no agreement in ſentiment, reſpecting the truths and doctrines of the goſpel, but a great difference and oppoſition; and think that doctrinal ſentiments are of no importance in chriſtianity; and that their having no belief of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular doctrines, and no creed; or differing in their religious ſentiments ever ſo much, is no impediment to the greateſt union and chriſtian friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, ſeem not to know, what real chriſtian union, love and friendſhip is.

The catholiciſm and love for which they plead, appears to be a <hi>political</hi> love and union, which may in ſome meaſure unite civil worldly ſocieties; but has nothing of the nature of real chriſtianity, and that union and love by which the followers of Chriſt are ONE.</note>

               <p>They will have unſpeakable ſatisfaction and delight in worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping God in ſecret, and in ſocial worſhip, whether more private or public. And their meditations and ſtudy on divine things will be ſweet. The word of God will be to them ſweeter than honey or the honey comb; and they will rejoice in the truths there
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:025635_0066_0FCEAC7584F07338"/>revealed, more than the men of the world ever did, or can do in all riches. In public aſſemblies, while the heart and lips of the preacher will glow with heavenly truth, and he pours light and inſtruction on a numerous congregation, they will all hang upon his lips, and drink in the divine ſentiments which are communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, with a high reiiſh and delight. And in ſuch entertainments there will be enjoyed unſpeakably more real pleaſure and happineſs, than all the men of the world ever found in the moſt gay, brilliant company, with the moſt agreeable feſtivity and mirth, muſic and dancing, that is poſſible. The latter is not worthy to be compared with the former.</p>
               <p>Then religious enjoyment, whether in company or alone, will appear to be a reality, and of the higheſt and moſt noble kind; and every one will be a witneſs and inſtance of it. There will then be no briar and thorns to moleſt enjoyment, or render company diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable; but all will be amiable, happy and full of love, and render themſelves agreeable to every one. Every one will behave with decency and propriety towards all, agreeable to his ſtation and connections. The law of kindneſs will be on the tongues of all; and true friendſhip, of which there is ſo little among men now, will then be common and univerſal, even chriſtian love and friendſhip, which is the moſt excellent kind of friendſhip, and is indeed the only real, happy, laſting friendſhip. And this will lay a foundation for a peculiar, happy intimacy and friendſhip, in the neareſt relations and connections: By which conjugal and domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic duties will be faithfully performed; and the happineſs of thoſe relations will be very great; and the end of the inſtitutions of marriage, and families, be anſwered in a much greater degree, than ever before, and they will have their proper effect, in promoting the enjoyment of individuals, and the good of ſociety.</p>
               <p>Then the happineſs and joy each one will have in the welfare of others, and the bleſſings beſtowed on them, will be very great. Now the few chriſtians who exerciſe diſintereſted benevolence, have, as the Apoſtle Paul had, great heavineſs, and continual ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row in their hearts, while they behold ſo many miſerable objects: And are ſurrounded with thoſe who are unhappy in this world, and appear to be going to everlaſting deſtruction, by their folly and obſtinacy in ſin. They have great comfort and joy, indeed, in the few who appear to be chriſtians, and heirs of eternal life.— When they ſee perſons who appear to underſtand and love the
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:025635_0067_0FCEAC7755B5B570"/>doctrines of the goſpel, and to have imbibed the amiable, excellent ſpirit of chriſtianity, and to be the bleſſed favourites of heaven, they greatly rejoice with them in their happineſs, and can ſay, as Paul did, "What thanks can we render to God for you, for all the joy wherewith we rejoice <hi>for your ſakes</hi> before our God!"
<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Theſſ. iii. 9.</note> But in the Millennium, the happineſs and joy of each one, will be unſpeakably greater, in the character and happineſs of all.

There will then be no ſuch infinitely miſerable objects, which are now every where to be ſeen, to excite painful grief and ſorrow; and the character of chriſtians will then be much more beautiful and excellent, than that of real chriſtians is now, as they will abound ſo much more in all holy exerciſe and practice; and their preſent enjoyment, and future happineſs in heaven, will be more evident and realized by each one, which will give pleaſure and joy to every one, in the amiable character and happineſs of others, even beyond all our preſent conceptions. "There ſhall be no more a pricking briar unto the church, or particular chriſtians, nor any grieving thorn, of all that are round about them."

               <p>THERE are many other things and circumſtances which will take place in that day, which are implied in what has now been obſerved, or may be inferred from it, and from the ſcripture, by which the advantages, happineſs and glory of the Millennium will be promoted; ſome of which will be mentioned in the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars:</p>

Then there will be no law ſuits, which now, in civilized nations, are ſo vexatious and very expenſive of time and money.

               <p>The intemperance, exceſs, extravagance and waſte, in food and raiment, and the uſe of the things of life, which were before prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed, will be diſcarded and ceaſe, in that day.

               <p>And at that time, the art of huſbandry will be greatly advanced, and men will have ſkill to cultivate and manure the earth, in a much better and more eaſy way, than ever before; ſo that the fame land will thon produce much more than it does now, twenty, thirty, ſixty, and perhaps an hundred fold more. And that which is now eſteemed barren, and not capable of producing any thing, by cultivation, will then yield much more, for the ſuſtenance of man and beaſt, than that which is moſt productive now; So that a very little ſpot will then produce more of the neceſſaries and comforts of life, than large tracts of land do now.

There may be inventions and arts of this kind, which are beyond our preſent conception. And if they could be now known by any one, and he could tell what they will be, they would be thought by moſt, to be utterly incredible and impoſſible; as thoſe inventions and arts, which are now known and familiar to us, would have appeared to thoſe who lived before they were found out and took place.</p>

It is not impoſſible, but very probable, that ways will yet be found out by men, to cut rocks and ſtones into any ſhape they pleaſe; and to remove them from place to place, with as little la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, as that with which they now cut and remove the ſofteſt and lighteſt wood, in order to build houſes, fences, bridges, paving roads, &amp;c. And thoſe huge rocks and ſtones, which now appear to be uſeleſs, and even a nuiſance, may then be found to be made, and reſerved by him who is infinitely wiſe and good, for great uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, and important purpoſes. Perhaps there is good reaſon not to doubt of this. And can he doubt of it, who conſiders what inventions and arts have taken place in latter ages, which are as much an advance beyond what was known or thought of in ages before, as ſuch an art would be, beyond what is now known and practiſed? The art by which they removed great ſtones, and raiſed them to a vaſt height, by which they built the pyramids in Egypt; and that by which huge ſtones were cut and put into the temple of Jeruſalem, is now loſt, and it cannot be conceived how this was done. This art may be revived in the Millennium; and there may be other inventions and arts, to us, inconceivably greater and more uſeful than that. Then, in a literal ſenſe, The vallies ſhall be filled, and the mountains and hills ſhad be made low, and the crooked ſhall be made ſtraight, and the rough way, ſhall be made ſmooth, to render travelling more convenient and caſy, and the earth more productive and fertile.</p>
               <p>When all theſe things are conſidered, which have now been ſuggeſted, and others which will naturally occur to them who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to this ſubject, it will appear evident, that in the days of the Millennium, there will be a fulneſs and plenty of all the neceſſaries and conveniences of life, to render all much more eaſy and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable, in their worldly circumſtances and enjoyments, than ever before, and with much leſs labour and toil: And that it will not be then neceſſary for any men or women to ſpend all, or the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of their time in labour, in order to procure a living, and enjoy all the comforts and deſirable conveniencies of life. It will not be neceſſary for each one, to labour more than two or three hours in a day, and not more than will conduce to the health and vigour of the body. And the reſt of their time they will be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſpend in reading and converſation, and in all thoſe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes which are neceſſary and proper, in order to improve their minds, and make progreſs in knowledge; eſpecially in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge

<pb n="74" facs="unknown:025635_0073_0FCEAC80889C9ED0"/>and populous, it has been, and ſtill is, far from being filled with inhabitants, ſo that it could ſupport no more, except in a very few inſtances, if in any. An exact calculation cannot be made; but it is preſumed that every man, who conſiders the things which have been mentioned above, will be ſenſible that this earth may be made capable of ſuſtaining thouſands to one of mankind who now inhabit it; ſo that if each one were multiplied to many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands, the earth would not be more than filled, and all might have ample proviſion for their ſuſtenance, convenience and comfort.— This will not take place, ſo long as the world of mankind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to exerciſe ſo much ſelfiſhneſs, unrighteouſneſs and impiety as they do now, and always have done: But there is reaſon to think they will be greatly diminiſhed, by their deſtroying them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and one another, and by remarkable divine judgments, which will be particularly conſidered in a following ſection.</p>
               <p>But when the Millennium ſhall begin, the inhabitants which ſhall then be on the earth, will be diſpoſed to obey the divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, to ſubdue the earth, and multiply, until they have filled it; and they will have ſkill, and be under all deſirable advantages to do it; and the earth will be ſoon repleniſhed with inhabitants, and be brought to a ſtate of high cultivation and improvement, in every part of it, and will bring forth abundantly for the full ſupply of all; and there will be many thouſand times more people than ever exiſted before at once in the world. Then the following proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecy, which relates to that day, ſhall be fulfilled: "A little one ſhall become a thouſand, and a ſmall one a ſtrong nation. I the Lord will haſten it in his time."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſri. lx. 78.</note> And there is reaſon to think the earth will be then, in ſome degree, enlarged in more ways than can now be mentioned, or thought of. In many thouſands, hundred of thouſands, yea, millions of inſtances, large tracts now covered with water, coves and arms of the ſea, may be drained, or the water ſhut out by banks and walls; ſo that hundreds of millions of perſons may live on thoſe places, and be ſuſtained by the produce of them, which are now overflowed with water.— Who can doubt of this, who recollects how many millions of people now inhabit Holland and the Low Countries, the greateſt part of which wasonce covered with the ſea, or thought not to be capable of improvement? Other inſtances might be mentioned.</p>
               <p>Though there will be ſo many millions of millions of people on the earth at the ſame time, this will not be the leaſt inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:025635_0074_0FCEAC8207B841E0"/>to any; but the contrary; for each one will be fully ſupplied with all he wants, and they will all be united in love, as brethren of one family, and will be mutual helps and bleſſings to each other. They will die, or rather fall aſleep, and paſs into the inviſible world; and others will come on the ſtage in their room. But death then will not be attended with the ſame calamitous and terrible circumſtances as it has been, and is now; and will not be conſidered as an evil. It will not be brought on with long and painful ſickneſs, or be accompanied with any great diſtreſs of body or mind. They will be in all reſpects ready for it, and welcome it with the greateſt comfort and joy. Every one will die at the time, and in the manner which will be beſt for him, and all with whom he is connected: And death will not bring diſtreſs on ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viving relatives and friends; and they will rather rejoice than mourn, while they have a lively ſenſe of the wiſdom and goodneſs of the will of God, and of the greater happineſs of the inviſible world, to which their beloved friends are gone; and where they expect ſoon to arrive. So that in that day, death will in a great meaſure looſe his ſting, and have the appearance of a friend, and be welcomed by all as ſuch.</p>
               <p n="3">3. In the Millennium, all will probably ſpeak <hi>one language:</hi> So that one language ſhall he known and underſtood all over the world, when it ſhall be filled with inbabitants innumerable.</p>
               <p>The whole earth was once, and originally of one language, and of one ſpeech.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xi. 1.6.</note> And the folly and rebellion of men was the oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion of their being confounded in ſpeaking and underſtanding this one language, and the introduction of a variety of languages. This was conſidered as in itſelf a great calamity, and was ordered as ſuch: And it can be conſidered in no other light. Had men been diſpoſed to improve the advantages of all ſpeaking and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding one language, to wiſe and good purpoſes, this diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity never would have taken place. And when men ſhall become univerſally pious, virtuous and benevolent, and be diſpoſed to uſe ſuch an advantage and bleſſing as having one ſpeech and language will be, for the glory of God and the general good, it will doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs be reſtored to them again. This may caſily and ſoon be done, without a miracle, when mankind and the ſtate of the world ſhall be ripe for it. When they ſhall all become as one family in affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and diſcerning and wiſdom ſhall preſide and govern in all
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:025635_0075_0FCEAC8391F6E850"/>their affairs, ſhey will ſoon be ſenſible of the great diſadvantage of being divided into ſo many different tongues, which will greatly impede that univerſal free intercourſe which will be very deſirable; and of the advantage of all ſpeaking and uſing one language. And God may ſo order things in his providence that it will then be eaſy for the moſt learned and wife to determine which is the beſt language to be adopted, to be univerſally taught and ſpoken.— And when this ſhall be once determined, and publiſhed through the world, by thoſe who are acknowledged to be the wiſeſt men, and beſt able to fix upon a language that ſhall be univerſal, and have a right to do it, all will freely conſent to the propoſal. And that language will be taught in all ſchools, and uſed in publie writings, and books that ſhall be printed; and in a few years will become the common language, underſtood and ſpoken by all; and all or moſt of the different languages now in the world will be forgotten and loſt. All the learning and knowledge of former ages, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in books, in different languages, worth preſerving, will be introduced and publiſhed in the univerſal language, and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to all. This will in a great meaſure, ſuperſede and render uſeleſs the great expenſe of time, toil and money, which is now beſtowed on teaching and ſtudying what are called the <hi>learned lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guages.</hi> Many thouſands if not millions of youths are now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuming years in learning theſe languages, at great expenſe of money: And thouſands of teachers are ſpending their lives in attending to them. It is thought by many now, that this is a uſeleſs and imprudent waſte of time and money, in moſt inſtances, at leaſt: It will appear to be much more ſo, when there ſhall be one univerſal language, which ſhall be underſtood and ſpoken by all; and when the books written in that language ſhall contain all the uſeful learning and knowledge in the world; and all far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther improvements will be communicated to the world in that language.</p>
               <p>And when this language ſhall be eſtabliſhed, and become univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, all the learning and wiſdom in the world, will tend and ſerve to improve it, and render it more and more perfect. And there can be no doubt that ſuch improvements will be made that perſons will be able to communicate their ideas with more eaſe and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion, and with leſs ambiguity and danger of being miſunderſtood, than could be done before.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:025635_0076_0FCEAC85C4FD67A0"/>
And ways will be invented to learn children to read this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage with propriety, and to ſpell and write it with correctneſs, with more caſe, and in much leſs time, than it is now done, and with little labour and coſt. And ways may be invented, perhaps ſomething like the ſhort hands, which are now uſed by many, by which they will be able to communicate their ideas, and hold in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe and correſpondence with each other, who live in differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent parts of the world, with much leſs expenſe of time and labour, perhaps an hundred times leſs, than that with which men now correſpond.</p>
               <p>This will alſo greatly facilitate the ſpreading uſeful knowledge, and all kinds of intelligence, which may be a benefit to mankind, to all parts of the world; and render books very cheap, and eaſy to be obtained by all. There will then be no need of tranſlations into other languages, and numerous new impreſſions, in order to have the moſt uſeful books read by all. Many hundreds of thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands of copies may be caſt off by one impreſſion, and ſpread over all the earth. And the Bible, one of which, at leaſt, every perſon will have, by printing ſuch a vaſt number of them at one impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, may be afforded much cheaper than it can be now; even though it ſhould be ſuppoſed that no improvement will be made in the art of printing, and making paper, which cannot be reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably ſuppoſed; but the contrary is much more probable, viz. that both theſe will then be performed, in a better manner, and with much leſs labour and expenſe, than they are now executed. None can doubt of this, who conſider what improvements have been made in theſe arts, ſince they were firſt invented.</p>
               <p>This univerſality of language will tend to cement the world of mankind ſo as to make them <hi>one,</hi> in a higher degree, and to great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er advantage, than otherwiſe could be. This will abſorb the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions that are now kept up between nations ſpeaking different languages, and promote a general, free communication. It is ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, when there was but one language in the world, that the people were <hi>one.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xi. 6.</note> And this will greatly facilitate their united ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions, to effect whatever may be for the public good.</p>
               <p>Therefore, ſince there will be ſo many and great advantages, in having one univerſal language, underſtood and uſed by all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and it will anſwer ſo many good purpoſes, when men ſhall be diſpoſed to make a right improvement of it; and ſince it may be ſo eaſily effected, when men ſhall be united in piety and benev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olence,
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:025635_0077_0FCEAC873B6A9A10"/>and wiſdom ſhall reign among them; there is reaſon to think that God will ſo order things in his providence, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and turn the hearts of mankind, as in the moſt agreeable manner to introduce the beſt language, to be adopted and uſed by all, in that day, in which great and peculiar favour and bleſſings will be granted to the world, far beyond thoſe which had been given in preceding ages. And this is agreeable to the ſcripture, which ſpeaks of that day, as diſtinguiſhed and remarkable for the union and happineſs of mankind, when they ſhall have <hi>one bo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p n="4">4. The church of Chriſt will then be formed and regulated, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his laws and inſtitutions, in the moſt beautiful and pleaſing order.</p>
               <p>This is implied in what has been ſaid; but is worthy of a more particular attention. There will then be but one univerſal, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholic church, comprehending all the inhabitants of the world, formed into numerous particular ſocieties and congregations, as ſhall be moſt convenient, to attend on public worſhip, and the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions of Chriſt. There will be no ſchiſms in the church then: Chriſtians will not be divided into various ſects and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations; but there will be a beautiful and happy union in ſentiment, reſpecting the doctrines, worſhip and inſtitutions of Chriſt; and all will be of one heart, and one way, and ſerve Chriſt with one conſent. The ordinances of baptiſm and the
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:025635_0078_0FCEAC898568C7E8"/>Lord's ſupper, and all the inſtitutions of Chriſt, will be attended in due order, with ſolemnity and decency; and being accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with divine efficacy, will have their proper and ſaving ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect. All the children will be members of the church, having the initiating ſeal applied to them, and being ſolemnly devoted to Chriſt in baptiſm; and they will be faithfully brought up for him, and early diſcover their love to Chriſt, not only in words, but by obeying him, and attending upon all his inſtitutions. The diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline which Chriſt has inſtituted, will be faithfully practiſed, ſo far as there ſhall be any occaſion; and chriſtians, by watching over each other in love, and exhorting and admoniſhing one another, will prevent, or immediately heal all offences. In thoſe reſpects, and in others not here mentioned, and perhaps not thought of, the church of Chriſt will then be the beſt regulated, moſt beautiful and happy ſociety that ever exiſted, or can be formed on earth. "When the Lord ſhall build up Zion, the church, he ſhall appear in his glory." Then, what is predicted in the ſixtieth chapter of Iſaiah, and many other prophecies of the ſame event, ſhall be fufilled. God ſays to his church, "Ariſe, ſhine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee: Whereas thou haſt been forſaken and hated, ſo that no man went through thee, I will make thee an eternal excellency, the joy of many generations. I will make the place of my feet glorious. Thou ſhalt alſo be a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord, and a royal diadem in the hand of thy God. Glorious things are ſpoken of thee, O city of God."

<p>It has been a queſtion, Whether in the Millennium, when the church ſhall be thus univerſal, and be brought to ſuch a well regulated, holy and happy ſtate, there will be any need of civil rulers, to preſide and govern in temporal matters?

                     <p>But when it is conſidered, that the church of Chriſt is not a worldly ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, and has no concern with temporal matters, and the concerns of the world, conſidered merely as ſuch, or any farther than they are included in obedience to the laws of Chriſt: And that there will be need of regulations and laws or orders, with reſpect to the temporal concerns of mankind; it will appear proper and convenient, if not neceſſary, that there ſhould be wife men choſen and appointed to ſuperintend, and direct in worldly af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, whoſe buſineſs it ſhall be to conſult the temporal intereſt of men, and dictate thoſe regulations from time to time, which ſhall promote the public good, and the temporal intereſt of individuals.</p>

Then chriſtianity will appear in its true beauty and excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, and the nature and genuine effects of it will be more mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt than ever before, and the truth and amiableneſs of it be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in a clear and ſtriking light.</p>
               <p>Chriſtianity has hitherto been generally abuſed and perverted by thoſe who have enjoyed the goſpel; and but little of the genu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ine ſpirit and power of it has appeared among thoſe who have been called chriſtians. They have, the moſt of them, diſobeyed the laws of Chriſt, and miſrepreſented and perverted the doctrines and inſtitutions of the goſpel, to accommodate it to the gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſelfiſhneſs, pride and worldly ſpirit; and have hated and perſecuted one another unto death. They have divided into innumerable ſects and parties, and have not been agreed in the doctrines and inſtitutions of the goſpel; but have embraced va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and contrary opinions concerning them; and contended a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout them with wrath and bitterneſs. And the greateſt part of the chriſtian world have been as openly vicious, as the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then nations, if not more ſo. And as the name of God was blaſphemed among the Gentiles by the wicked lives of the Jews,

<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Pet. ii. 2.</note> But few in the chriſtian world, in compariſon with the reſt, have honoured Chriſt, by entering into the true meaning and ſpirit of the goſpel, loving it, and living agreeable to it: And thoſe few have been generally hidden and overlooked by the multitude of merely nominal chriſtians. And genuine chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity is not to be found in the faith and lives of thoſe in general who aſſume the name of chriſtians; but in the Bible only, ſince the moſt who profeſs to know Chriſt, by their doctrines and works do deny him.</p>
               <p>But in the Millennium the ſcene will be changed, and chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity will be underſtood and acted out, in the true ſpirit and power of it, and have its genuine effect, in the lives and conduct of all. And when it comes to be thus reduced to practice by all, it will appear from fact and experience, to have a divine ſtamp; and that the goſpel is indeed the wiſdom of God, and the power of God, forming all who cordially embrace it to a truly amiable and excellent character, and is ſuited to make men happy in this
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:025635_0080_0FCEAC8C7AFF8400"/>world, and that which is to come. Then all the diſgrace and reproach, which has come upon Chriſt, his true followers, and upon chriſtianity, by the wickedneſs and enmity of men, and the abuſe of the goſpel, ſhall be wiped off. This is foretold in the following words: "Behold, at that time I will undo all that afflict thee, and I will ſave her that halteth, and gather her that was driven out, and I will get them praiſe and fame in every land, where they have been put to ſhame. I will make you a name and a praiſe among all people of the earth."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Zeph. xix, 10.</note> After the various ſchemes of falſe religion and infidelity have been tried by men, and the evil nature and bad effects of them diſcovered, real chriſtianity, as it is ſtated in divine revelation, when it ſhall be underſtood by all, and appear in univerſal practice, will ſhine with peculiar luſtre and glory; and the beauty and excellence of it, and the happineſs it produces, will be more apparent and affecting, and be more ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired, by the contraft, than if no ſuch deluſion and falſe religion had taken place. This is repreſented in the laſt words of David the Prophet. "And he ſhall be as the light of the morning, when the ſun riſeth, even a morning without clouds; as the tender graſs ſpringing out of the earth by clear ſhining after rain."
<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Sam. xxiii, 4.</note>— When the ſun riſes in a clear morning, after a dark, ſtormy night, and the tender graſs ſprings up freſh and lively, it is much more pleaſant and refreſhing, than if it had not been preceded by ſuch a night.</p>

               <p>The Spirit of God will then be poured out in his glorious ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and fill the world with holineſs, and ſalvation, as flood, upon the dry ground. All the preceding influences of the Holy Spirit, in converting and ſaving men, are but the firſt fruits, which precede the harveſt, which will take place in that latter day. This was typified in the Moſaic inſtitutions. The moſt remarkable feſtivals were the Paſſover, the feaſt of the firſt fruits, and the feaſt of Tabernacles, upon which all the males in Iſrael were com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to attend at Jeruſalem. The Paſſover typifred the death

The feaſt of the firſt fruits, or Pentecoſt, as it is called in the New Teſtament, typified the firſt fruits of the death of Chriſt, in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, and the converſion of men, when the goſpel was firſt preached, which took place at the time of this feaſt."

This is the time when Chriſt will ſee the fruit of the travel of his ſoul, and ſhall be ſatisfied. To this day moſt of the prophecies of Chriſt, and ſalvation, and of the good things which were coming to the church, have their principal reference, and they will have their chief fulfilment then. This is the day which our Lord ſaid Abraham ſaw with gladneſs and joy. "Your father Abraham rejoiced (or leaped forward) to ſee my day: And he ſaw it, and was glad."

               <p>Then the chief end of divine revelation will be anſwered. It has been given with a chief reference to that time, and it will then be the mean of producing unſpeakably greater good, than in all ages before.

               <p>ALL who attend to the ſubject of the Millennium, will naturally inquire, When this happy time will take place; and how long it will be before it ſhall be introduced?

               <p>Though it may be evident from ſcripture, that the ſeventh thouſand years of the world, will be the time of the proſperity of the church of Chriſt, on earth; yet this event may come on by degrees, and be in a meaſure introduced years before that time, and the church may not be brought to the moſt comp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And in the Moſaic ritual, which contained many typical inſtitutions, the Iſraelites were cummanded, not only to obſerve every ſeventh day, as a day of reſt; but every ſeventh year as a Sabbath, and year of reſt. And the ſeventh month in every year, was a feſtival and ſacred month, above all other months of the year. In this month was the feaſt of Tabernacles, which was to be obſerved ſeven days with great joy. On the firſt day of this month was the feaſt of trumpets, when the trumpets were to be blown through all the land, which was a type of the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary preaching of the goſpel which will introduce the Millen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nium.

               <p>The prophecies in the book of Daniel, of the riſe and continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the little born, and of the time in which the church ſhall be in a ſtate of affliction; and thoſe in the Revelation, of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the beaſt, who is the ſame with the born; and of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>In the Revelation, the time of the continuance of the beaſt, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his deadly wound was healed, is ſaid to be ſorty and two months.
<note n="†" place="bottom">Chap. xiii. 5.</note> And the time in which the church ſhould be trodden down, afflicted and oppreſſed, is ſaid to be ſorty and two months, a thouſand two humdred and ſixty days, and a time, and times, and half a time.

So long the beaſt, the idolatrous per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuting power, exerciſed by the Biſhop of Rome, the Pope, is to continue; during which time, the church of Chriſt is to be op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, afflicted and oppoſed, repreſented by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

At the end of thoſe years, the Pope and the church of Rome, of which he is the head, will be deſtroyed. And accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the repreſentation in the Revelation, the kingdom of the devil in the world, will fall at the ſame time, and the kingdom of Chriſt be ſet up on the ruins of it, and the Millennium will take place.</p>
               <p>If it were known when the Biſhop of Rome firſt became what is deſigned to be denoted by the beaſt, the time of his fall, and of the end of the church of Rome, and of ſatan's kingdom in the world, when the Millennium will communce, could not be aſcertained up a year. But as this beaſt roſe gradually from ſtep to ſtep, till he became a beaſt, in the higheſt and moſt proper ſenſe, this involves the ſubject in ſome degree of uncertainty, and renders it more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to determine, at which conſiderable increaſe and advance of the Biſhop of Rome in power and influence, the thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ſixty years began. He had great influence, not only in the church, in eccleſiaſtical matters, but in the temporal affairs of the Roman empire, and of the kingdoms which were erected in it, by the invaſion of the northern nations, before he was publicly ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged and declared to be Univerſal Biſhop; which was done in the year of Chriſt, 606. This greatly increaſed his influence and power in the chriſtian world; and the church was now become ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding corrupt. If the 1260 years be reckoned from this time, they will end in the year 1866, ſeventy four years from this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                  </gap>, viz. 1792. But the Pope did not become a temporal prince and publicly aſſume civil juriſdiction, till the year 756, when Popie, the king of France, then the moſt powerful prince in chriſtendom, made him prince over a large dominion, and he aſſumed civil au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and upon this he ſubdued three kings or kingdoms, and
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:025635_0087_0FCEAC98A7E0E878"/>they fell before him, according to the prediction of him in the prophecy of Daniel.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. vii. 8, 20, 24.</note> And he ſoon had ſuch power over the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as to ſet up an emperor in Germany, to be his tool, by whom to raiſe himſelf to univerſal empire, reſerving to himſelf and claiming power over the emperor, and over all kings in the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian world, to let them up and crown them, or depoſe them when he pleaſed.</p>
               <p>This is the moſt remarkable epoch; when the Pope became a beaſt, in the moſt proper ſenſe, from whence his reign is to be dated. Twelve hundred and ſixty years from this date, 756, will end near the beginning of the ſeventh thouſandth years of the world. But as he roſe to this height gradually, and was a beaſt in a lower ſenſe long before this, it is reaſonable to ſuppoſe that he will fall by degrees, until his uſurped power is wholly taken from him, and the falſe church of Rome, the great whore, utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly deſtroyed; and that he has been falling many years; and that as the time of his reign draws nearer to a cloſe, more remarkable events, by which he and that church will come to total ruin, will take place in a more rapid ſucceſſion.

Daniel deſcribes this little horn, as it appeared to him in the viſion, in the following words: "And out of one of them came forth a little horn, which waxed exceeded great toward the ſouth, and toward the eaſt, and toward the pleaſant land. And it waxed great, even to the hoſt of heaven, and it caſt downſome of the hoſt, and of the ſtars, to the ground, and ſtamped

               <p>The little horn, which is the chief ſubject of this viſion, and was to do ſuch great things againſt the holy people, the church, came forth out of one of the four notable horns, toward the four winds of heaven, which grew out of the goat, after the one great horn was broken, which the goat had at firſt.

From this time, and this ſmall beginning, the Romans aroſe by their policy, power and conqueſts, until they arrived to a vaſt and univerſal empire. And as they exiſted as a people when the Grecian empire was divided into four kingdoms or horns, and they were really included in the weſtern horn, and ſoon roſe out of it, and went on and grew to univerſal empire, their beginning may properly be rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This partitior of the Grecian empire into four kingdoms or horns, was juſt about three hundred years before the birth of Jeſus Chriſt, or the beginning of the chriſtian era. And as the incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Chriſt was about the beginning of the fifth thouſand years of the world, two thouſand and three hundred years from the riſe of the four horns will end at or near the beginning of the ſeventh thouſand years of the world.

That the reign of antichriſt, who is the laſt head of the Roman empire, will end about the beginning of the ſeventh millenary of the world, when the Millennium will begin, and the meek, the ſaints, ſhall inherit the earth, take the kingdom and reign with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>In the laſt chapter of Daniel, "One ſaid to the man clothed in linen, which was upon the waters of the river, How long ſhall it be to the end of theſe wonders?" The anſwer is made in a very ſolemn manner, in the following words: "It ſhall be for a time, times, and an half. And when he ſhall have accompliſhed to ſcatter the power of the holy people, all theſe things ſhall be fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed." He who ſhall ſcatter the power of the holy people or the ſaints, is the ſame with the horn, mentioned in the ſeventh chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who ſhould "Wear out the ſaints of the Moſt High;" which is the ſame event which is here expreſſed in different words. And the time of his doing this, is the ſame which is mentioned here: "And they ſhall be given into his hand, until a time, and times, and the dividing of time."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Chap. vii. 15.</note> That is, three prophetical years and an half, in which are 1260 prophetical days, which are put for ſo many years. And this is the ſame power which is called a beaſt in the Revelation, who was to do the ſame thing mentioned here, viz. It was given unto him to make war with the faints, and to overcome them! And the ſame time is there fixed for his doing this. "And power was given unto him to continue (or practiſe and make war) forty and two months," after he was recovered to life from being wounded unto death;
<note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. xiii. 3, 5, 7.</note> which is juſt three years and an half, and twelve hundred and ſixty days.</p>
               <p>Daniel heard, but did not underſtand the anſwer, and therefore put the following queſtion, "Then ſaid I, O my Lord, what ſhall be the end of theſe things?" The anſwer is, "From the time that the daily ſacrifice ſhall be taken away, and the abomination that maketh deſolate ſet up, there ſhall be a thouſand two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ninety days. Bleſſed is he that waiteth, and cometh to the thouſand three hundred and five and thirty days." Here are two different numbers or times mentioned, and neither of them agrees exactly with the foregoing anſwer. In that, the time of the continuance of the perſecuting power, which ſhall ſcatter and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>car out the faints, is limited to 1260 years. In the anſwer to
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:025635_0093_0FCEACA17AA70F78"/>Daniel's queſtion, two different numbers of years are mentioned, when thoſe evil things ſhall come to an end, and the prophana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the church, and the worſhip and ordinances of Chriſt, ſhall ceaſe, and the church ſhall be reſtored to due order, and be bleſſed and brought to a happy, glorious ſtate, viz. 1290, and 1335 years. The firſt is 30 years longer than the time mentioned above, and in the Revelation, and the laſt exceeds it 75 years. This ſeeming difference may be reconciled by obſerving, that theſe anſwers do not reſpect preciſely the ſame event. The former expreſſes the time of the continuance and reign of antichriſt, in which he ſhall oppreſs the church of Chriſt: And when he ſhall have accompliſhed to ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the power of the holy people, he ſhall be deſtroyed. The latter looks forward to the recovery of the church of Chriſt, from her low, afflicted, broken ſtate, to a ſtate of peace and proſperity, in the proper uſe and enjoyment of the worſhip, inſtitutions and ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Chriſt, which had been to greatly corrupted by the falſe church of Rome. It may take ſome time to effect this, after the Pope and the church of Rome are wholly deſtroyed and extinct. As the corruption and perverſion of the church, worſhip and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances of Chriſt, was brought on by degrees, and conſiderable advances were made in this, after antichriſt aroſe, and the Pope became a perſecuting beaſt; ſo doubtleſs the church will not be wholly purified when this beaſt ſhall be deſtroyed; but it will be ſome time after this, before all corruptions and errors in doctrine and practice, will be wholly extirpated, and the church appear in her true beauty, and come to a ſtate of univerſal, eſtabliſhed peace and proſperity. Within thirty years after the beaſt ſhall be ſlain, and his body deſtroyed and given to the burning flame, or at the end of 1290 years, the church may become univerſal, and all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be members of it; and it may arrive to a ſtate of great pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and peace, and an end be put to all her troubles, and moſt of the wicked be ſwept off from the face of the earth, by ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable event, and ſudden ſtroke; by which the kingdom of fatan ſhall be nearly extinct; and his influence among mankind almoſt wholly ceaſe. But the church of Chriſt may not arrive to the moſt pure and happy ſtate which it ſhall enjoy, under forty or fifty years after this. For this happy period chriſtians muſt wait; and they will be in a peculiar and high degree bleſſed, who ſhall come to this happy and glorious ſtate of the church, when the firſt reſurrection ſhall be univerſal and complete, and the Millennium
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:025635_0094_0FCEACA310A7BF88"/>ſtate eſtabliſhed, and brought to its full ſtature, and proper height in holineſs and happineſs, which took place in a conſiderable de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree, and might properly be ſaid to have began a number of years before. But theſe events, and the preciſe time and manner of their taking place, will be fully known, and the prophecies by which they are foretold, will be better underſtood, when they ſhall be actually accompliſhed; and all the miſtakes which are now made reſpecting them, will be rectified; until which time, they muſt be in ſome meaſure ſealed. Nevertheleſs, it may be evident from divine revelation, that the end of the reign of antichriſt draws near, and the time of deliverance of the church, from the dark and low ſtate in which it has been near twelve hundred years, and of the ruin of the kingdom of ſatan in the world, is not far off; and that theſe great events will come on within two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years, or about that time; and that the ſeventh thouſand years of the world, is the time fixed for the proſperity of the church of Chriſt, and the reign of the ſaints on earth.

               <p>It has been obſerved, that as antichriſt roſe gradually, from one degree of influence and power to another, till he became a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete beaſt, ſo this perſecuting, idolatrous, antichriſtian power will fall by degrees, until it is wholly taken out of the way: And there may, and probably will be, 1260 years between the moſt remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able ſteps by which he roſe, and as great and remarkable ſteps, by which he is to fall, and go into perdition.

This is evident from the fifteenth and fixteenth chapters of the Revelation.

It is not meant, that they ſhall be gathered into one place on this globe, or any where alſe; but that they ſhall be united with one heart in the ſame cauſe of ſin and ſatan, againſt God, and his reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed truth and ways, in whatever part of the earth they live; and thus take arms, and riſe in open rebellion, provoking the Almigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to battle, and, in a ſenſe, challenging him to do his worſt.— Thus they will be as really gathered to the battle, as an army are gathered together to engage in battle with another army, or to beſiege a city.</p>
               <p>"And he gathered them together into a place called in the Hebrew tongue Armageddon." Armageddon is the mountain of Megiddo, at the foot of which the memorable battle was fought between the Canaanites, the enemies of Iſrael—and Barak, and the army under him, when Siſera and his hoſt were defeated and utterly deſtroyed; which was a complete overthrow of the Canaanites, and iſſued in the final deliverance of Iſrael from their yoke and power. This was a type of the total defeat and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of the enemies of Chriſt and his church, which will iſſue in the peace and proſperity of the church in the Millennium ſtate. This is intimated in the concluding words of the ſong of Deborah
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:025635_0104_0FCEACB07A2DE3F0"/>and Barak, in which this victory and deliverance is celebrated. "So let all thine enemies periſh, O Lord: But let them who love him, be as the ſun when he goeth forth in his might."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Judg. v. 11.</note> There is therefore an alluſion to the type, in this prophecy of the event which was typified by it, viz.—the overthrow of all the combined enemies of Chriſt and his church, in the battle of that great day of God Almighty. It cannot be reaſonably inferred from this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction, that there will be a deciſive battle between Chriſt and his followers, and their enemies, in any particular place. All that is ſignified by theſe words is, that as Jabin king of Cantaan gathered together a great army under Siſera, to fight with the God of Iſrael and his people, at the foot of the mountain of Megiddo; who were there overthrown and deſtroyed in battle, when "they fought from heaven, the ſtars in their courſes fought againſt Siſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra:" So by the agency of the ſpirits of devils, under the ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intendence and direction of divine providence, the world of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general, and eſpecially thoſe in Chriſtendom, will be ſo corrupted and obſtinately rebellious, in all kinds, and the greateſt degrees of wickedneſs, as to be united, and, in this ſenſe, gathered together, all armed in a ſpiritual war againſt God, his cauſe and people. And their iniquity being full, and they ripe for the battle, God will ariſe as a man of war, and in his providence contend in battle with them, till they be utterly deſtroyed from the face of the earth. Thus "The wicked ſhall periſh, and the enemies of the Lord ſhall be as the fat of lambs, they ſhall conſume: Into ſmoke ſhall they conſume away," and by this, way ſhall be made for the meek to inherit the earth, and delight themſelves in the abundance of peace.

               <p>But this battle is to come on under the next vial, which is the ſeventh and laſt. When mankind ſhall be prepared and gathered together, by the great degree of all kinds of wickedneſs, while God has been waiting upon them, even to long ſuffering, in the uſe of very powerful, and all proper means to reclaim and reform them, he will ariſe to battle, and by doing terrible things in right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs, will manifeſt and diſplay his awful diſpleaſure with them, for their great wickedneſs, and obſtinacy in rebellion againſt him; and the events will then take place which are predicted un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſeventh vial.</p>

The prophecy then goes on to give a general and ſummary account of the battle of that great day, from the ſeventh verſe to the end of the chapter, and the great and marvellous effects it will have upon great Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon, i. e. the church of Rome, and upon the nations of the world in general. There will be the greateſt convulſions and revolutions in the political and moral world, that have ever been, attended with awful judgments upon men; which are predicted in prophet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ic language, "And there were voices, and thunders, and light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and a great earthquake, ſuch as was not ſince men were upon the earth, to mighty an earthquake, and ſo great. And every iſland fled away, and the mountains were not found."— "And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell: And great Babylon came into remembrance before God, to give unto her the cup of the wine of the fierceneſs of his wrath." The great city, and great Babylon, ſeem to be one and the ſame thing, the church of Rome. In the next chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, this ſame falſe church is called "Babylon the great," and "The great city which reigneth over the kings of the earth."

It doubtleſs intends, that which ſhall break the antichriſtian church into pieces, and will iſſue in the ruin of it, the fatal blow being ſtruck. Perhaps it intends a diviſion and oppoſition among thoſe who have been the members and ſupporters of that church, by which this ſpiritual Babylon ſhall fall, or which ſhall haſten on the ruin of it; as a kingdom divided againſt itſelf, cannot ſtand, but is brought to deſolation.

               <p>This battle is more particularly deſcribed in the nineteenth chapter, from the beginning of the eleventh verſe, to the end of the chapter. "And I ſaw heaven opened, and behold, a white horſe; and he who ſat upon him was called faithful and true, and in righteouſneſs doth he judge and make war." This perſon is farther deſcribed, by which he appears to be the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. "And the armies which were in heaven, followed him upon white horſes, clothed in fine linen, white and clean." This does not mean, that the inhabitants of heaven, or the ſaints on earth, will join in a viſible army, and perſonally ſight with the enemies of Chriſt and his church, and deſtroy them: But only that theſe ſhall join with Chriſt and be on his ſide, when he ſhall ariſe in his providence, and by his power deſtroy his and their enemies. In this ſenſe, all heaven will be with him, when he ſhall come forth to battle in his providence, and execute his wrath upon men, in awful ſucceſſive judgments, in which the angels may be uſed as inviſible inſtruments of his vengeance: And he will do all this, in anſwer to the prayers of his church on earth, and in their cauſe, to vindicate and deliver them, and prepare the way for the proſperity of his church on earth. That he will be the great inviſible agent in this battle, appears from the following words: And out of his mouth goeth a ſharp ſword, that with it be ſhould ſmite the nations: And he ſhall rule them with a rod of iron: And he treadeth the wine preſs of the tierceneſs and wrath of Almighty God." This is the battle of that great day of God Almighty. This awful ſeene proceeds and is yet farther deſcribed: "And I ſaw an angel ſtanding in the ſun; and be cried with a loud voice, ſaying to all the fowls that fly in the midſt of heaven, Come and gather yourſelves together unto the ſupper o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is a ſtrong, figurative, prophetic expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of the great ſlaughter and terrible deſtruction of mankind, when God Almighty ſhall come forth to battle, and manifeſt his hot diſpleaſure and terrible wrath, in the judgment he will inflict on them. The repreſentation of this battle, and the iſſue of it goes on, and "I John ſaw the beaſt, and the kings of the earth, and their armies <hi>gathered together,</hi> to make war againſt him who ſat on the horſe, and againſt his army." Theſe are the ſame who are mentioned, chap. xvi. 14, 16, as <hi>gathered together</hi> to the battle of that great day of God Almighty, the meaning of which has been explained. And in this war and battle, the beaſt and the falſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet were taken and deſtroyed, with their adherents. "And the remnant were ſlain with the ſword of him who fat upon the horſe, which ſword proceedeth out of his mouth, and all the fowls were filled with their fleſh." By <hi>the remnant,</hi> are meant the reſt of mankind, who by their ſins make war with Chriſt, and are not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the beaſt and falſe prophet, and their followers, who be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long to the kingdom of antichriſt.

               <p>The fame battle and ſlaughter of men, is repreſented and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted in figurative prophetic language, in the fourteenth chapter, where John deſcribes a viſion which he had of one like unto the Son of man, who ſat upon a white cloud, having on his head a golden crown, and in his hand a ſharp fickle. And it was ſaid un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him, "Thruſt in thy ſickle and reap; for the time is come for thee to reap; for the harveſt of the earth is ripe. And he thruſt in his fickle on the earth, and the earth was reaped. And another angel came out of the temple which is in heaven, he alſo having a ſharp ſickle." And it was ſaid unto him, Thruſt in thy ſharp fickle, and gather the cluſters of the vine of the earth; for her grapes are fully ripe. And the angel thruſt in his fickle into the earth, and gathered the vine of the earth, and caſt it into the great wine preſs of the wrath of God. And the wine preſs was trod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den without the city, and blood came out of the wine preſs, even unto the horſe bridles, by the ſpace of a thouſand and ſix hundred fur longs."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="unknown:025635_0110_0FCEACBD32780370"/>
Upon this viſion it is to be obſerved, that by the harveſt of the earth, and the cluſters of the vine of the earth, are meant the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the earth, or mankind in general. And reaping the harveſt, and gathering the cluſters of the vine of the earth, fignifies the ſlaughter and deſtruction of the inhabitants of the earth; not every one of them indeed; for in the harveſt and vintage, ſome ears of corn are commonly left ſtanding, which eſcape the ſickle, and a few ſcattering grapes are left on the vine when the cluſters in general are gathered: And that this ſlaughter and deſolation, which ſhall be made of the inhabitants of the world, will take place in conſequence of their apoſtacy, and obſtinate continuance and increaſe in ſin, until they are become ripe, fully ripe, for this dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful execution and deſtruction, by divine vengeance: Therefore, that this reaping, and the harveſt, and gathering the cluſters of the vine of the earth, will not be a merciful diſpenſation towards the inhabitants then in the world; but the execution of divine ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance, and an awful exerciſe and diſplay of the diſpleaſure and wrath of God, in the evils which ſhall fall on men, for their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance and increaſe in wickedneſs. This is repreſented and expreſſed in a ſtriking manner, by the figure of caſting the vintage into the great wine preſs of the wrath of God, and the large and amazing quantity of blood which proceeded from thence; figni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the great and general ſlaughter, and terrible ſufferings of mankind, when this time of his wrath ſhall come.</p>
               <p>From this view of the events predicted under the ſixth and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth vials, it appears, that while the ſixth vial is running, the way will be preparing for the overthrow of ſpiritual Babylon.</p>
               <p>One event will take place after another, which will greatly weaken and remove the power and influence of the Pope, among the nations in Chriſtendom, by taking away his riches, by drying up the ſtream of wealth, and the removal of other things, by which the church of Rome has been made ſtrong, and ſtood as impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable for many ages. But this will not be attended by any general reformation of profeſſing chriſtians, or revival and great increaſe of the true church of Chriſt; nor will the moral ſtate of the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian world, or of mankind in general, be reformed and grow bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but the contrary. By the evil influence which the beaſt and the hierarchy of the church of Rome, has had in the world, and by the power and agency of ſatan, the unreſtrained luſts of men will kurty them on to all kinds of wickedneſs; ſo that it will riſe to a

               <p>The true church of Chriſt will ſubſiſt and continue in this evil time of the prevalence of the powers of darkneſs; but the number of real chriſtians will be ſmall; and many, even of them, if not

They will be hated, oppoſed, and trodden down, by the wicked, and be in an afflicted, ſuffering ſtate in this dark and evil day. They will be in a great meaſure hidden and unknown, and the cauſe of Chriſt and of truth will be reproached, and appear to be almoſt loſt; and the true followers of Chriſt, his ſheep, will be ſcattered into corners in this cloudy and dark day.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Ezek. xxxiv. 12.</note> Whether wicked men, and enemies to the true ſervants of Chriſt, will perſecute them unto death, and renew this horrid work, of which ſo much has been done in former ages, in this time when iniquity will abound to ſuch a great degree, cannot be now determined, by any thing ſaid in ſcripture reſpecting it. It is thought by moſt, that ſince the Pope is brought ſo low, and his power and influence is ſtill ſinking ſo faſt; and ſo much light is ſpreading in favour of civil and religious liberty, ſhowing the reaſonableneſs and importance of it, and the unreaſonableneſs and folly of a perſecuting ſpirit; and liberal ſentiments reſpecting religion are propagated and increaſing, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecution on account of religious ſentiments or practice, is near come to an end, and never will be revived and practiſed again.— This may appear moſt probable: But though the antichriſtian church ſhould never perſecute the faithful followers of Chriſt again, and a perſecuting ſpirit ſhould wholly ceaſe among pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing chriſtians of all denominations; yet infidels, who condemn all religious perſecution, in every degree and form, in which it has been practiſed, and boaſt of their liberal ſentiments and ſpirit, with reſpect to this; and uſe it as a ſtrong and concluſive argument againſt chriſtianity itſelf, that profeſſed chriſtians have, in ſo many inſtances, perſecuted others; even <hi>theſe infidels,</hi> or their ſucceſſors, may find true chriſtians, their doctrines and practices, to be ſo diſagreeable and hateful to them, and, in their view, ſo hurtful to ſociety, and ſo contrary to all that, in which they place their own happineſs, and that of mankind, that having all reſtraints taken off, and the power being put into their hands, they may think theſe men ought not to be ſuffered to live; and that it is for the good of ſociety to have them extirpated, and put to death, unleſs they can be brought to renounce their ſentiments and practices, by perſuaſion or puniſhments; and ſo become as determined,

And they who now know what is in man, from the character given of him in ſcripture, and by the diſcovery mankind have made of their hearts, by words and deeds, and from a true acquaintance with their own hearts, muſt be ſenſible that nothing can prevent even men of this caſt preſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing chriſtians, but reſtraints from heaven.

<pb n="117" facs="unknown:025635_0116_0FCEACC57A45E478"/>and to diſcover, and ſet in the moſt clear and ſtriking light, the hardneſs, obſtinacy and wickedneſs of the heart of man, while they continue diſobedient and inflexible, under all theſe terrible diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations of providence, ſuited to awaken and reform them, to teach them the evil of ſin, and the awful diſpleaſure of God with them; and to warn them to fly from the wrath to come, and unto Chriſt, as the only refuge; and go on to revolt yet more and more, and blaſpheme the hand which inflicts theſe evils. By all this will be more clearly manifeſted, than ever before, how totally loſt and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely miſerable mankind are, and their infinite need of a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>decemer; that no means that can be uſed, or methods taken to reclaim and ſave them, will be in the leaſt degree effectual, unleſs the Spirit of God be given to change and renew their hearts, and therefore, that the ſalvation of men depends wholly on the mere ſovereign grace of God, even all that good, holineſs and ſalvation, which ſhall take place in the Millennium; and it will, in this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect, prepare the way for that day of grace.</p>
               <p>This battle and terrible ſlaughter and deſtruction of men in ſo many ways, and for ſo long a courſe of years, will greatly leſſen the number of mankind in the world; ſo that in the cloſe of this terrible ſcene, comparatively few will be left alive.

They will conſequently ſee the guilty, miſerable, and utterly loſt ſtate of man, and their need of a Redeemer, to make atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for their ſins, and the neceſſity of the Holy Spirit to renew their hearts, and form them to right, and truly chriſtian exerciſes: And will be clearly convinced of the truth of all the great and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant doctrines of the goſpel, and cordially embrace them. And they will repent and humble themſelves in the fight of the Lord, and earneſtly, with united hearts, cry to heaven for the forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their ſins, and for mercy on themſelves, and on their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, acknowledging their infinite ill deſert, and flying to Chriſt, and ſovereign grace through him, as their only refuge and hope. And then the ſcene will change. The battle will be over, divine
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:025635_0117_0FCEACC7A107FA78"/>judgments will ceaſe, and there will be no more frowns on man, in the providence of God; but all diſpenſations and events will be expreſſions of kindneſs and mercy; and the Holy Spirit will be poured out on them and their offspring, and all ſhall be holineſs to the Lord; and the Millennium will begin, and men will mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply and ſoon ſubdue the earth, and fill it with inhabitants.</p>
               <p>As antichriſt and the church of Rome, will have a large ſhare in the cup of indignation and wrath which will be poured out; ſo all the chriſtian world will have a diſtinguiſhed portion of it, as the inhabitants of it are much more guilty than others.

She is the <hi>Mother</hi> of all the falſe doctrines, ſuperſtition, inſidelity, and abominable practices in the proteſtant world. And where can the church be found, which is thoroughly purged from all theſe abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations? Some churches may be more pure, and may have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded farther in a reformation than others; but none are wholly clear of an antichriſtian ſpirit, and the fruits of it. There may be, and in many inſtances doubtleſs there is, much of the exerciſe of the ſpirit of antichriſt, in oppoſing what is called antichriſt, and the church of Rome; and by running into as great extremes ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther way. The Apoſtle Paul ſaid, this myſtery of iniquity, the man of ſin, which is antichriſt, began already to work in the churches even in his day.
<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Theſſ. ii. 7.</note> How much of this then, may it be reaſonably thought, is to be found in moſt, if not all the churches now? In this view, the ſpirit and operation of antichriſt are very extenſive. And how few churches, or individual chriſtians, have ſo far come out from this mother of harlots, and abominations of the earth, as not to be in any degree partakers of her fins, ſo as not to receive of her plagues? And while the ſixth vial continues to run, it is not to be expected that the proteſtant churches in general will grow more pure; but the evil ſpirits which are gone forth,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:025635_0118_0FCEACC8F5D8BE88"/>will promote and ſpread ſtill greater corruption in doctrine and practice, by which they will be more ripe for divine judgments, and prepared to ſuffer in the battle under the ſeventh vial. The pureſt churches, and real chriſtians, will ſoffer much in this battle, and few will go wholly unpuniſhed. By this the rebels, or falſe hearted profeſſing chriſtians, will be purged out from among real chriſtians, and theſe ſhall be purified and made white, and tried <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The deſtruction of the world of mankind by a flood, and the preſervation of Noah and his family, who were by this brought into a new world, to be repleniſhed by them, may be conſidered as a typical and prophetic repreſentation of the great battle with the wicked world, previous to the Millennium; by which the wicked will be ſwept off the earth, and the true church of Chriſt will be delivered and preſerved, and the way opened for its proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity, and filling the earth.</p>

               <p>This battle, by which the wicked will be deſtroyed, and the reign of Chriſt and his church on earth introduced, is frequently brought into view and predicted in the book of Pſalms. The following predictions of this kind, are worthy to be obſerved:— "Aſk of me, and I will give thee the heathen for thine inheritance, and the utmoſt parts of the earth for thy poſſeſſion. Thou ſhalt break them with a rod of iron, thou ſhalt daſh them in pieces
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:025635_0122_0FCEACCF413C77A0"/>like a potter's veſſel."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſal. ii. 8, 9.</note> There is reference to this prediction and promiſe in the following words of Chriſt: "And he that overcometh, and keepeth my works unto the end, to him will I give power over the nations; and he ſhall rule them with a rod of iron; as the veſſels of a potter ſhall they be broken to pieces, even as I received of my Father."
<note n="†" place="bottom">Rev. ii. 26, 27.</note> The followers of Chriſt are ſaid to do what he does for them, and in their behalf in deſtroying their enemies, as they are engaged in the ſame cauſe, and are with him in theſe works of vengeance, and they who have overcome, and have arrived to heaven, will be with him in a peculiar man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, when he ſhall come forth to fight this great battle, and daſh the nations of the world into pieces, as a potter's veſſel is broken. Therefore, there is again reference to thoſe words in the ſecond Pſalm, when Chriſt is repreſented as riding forth to the battle there deſcribed, followed by the armies in heaven, comprehending all who ſhall then have overcome. "And out of his mouth goeth a ſharp ſword, that with it he ſhould ſmite the nations: And he ſhall rule them with a rod of iron: And he treadeth the wine preſs of the fierceneſs and wrath of Almighty God."
<note n="‡" place="bottom">Rev. xix. 14, 15.</note> This is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly the ſame with the battle of that great day of Almighty God, mentioned in the ſixteenth chapter, as has been ſhown; and is predicted in the words now quoted from the ſecond Pſalm.— There is a prediction of the ſame battle deſcribed in the nineteenth chapter of the Revelation, in the following words: "Gird thy ſword upon thy thigh, O moſt mighty; with thy glory and thy majeſty. And in thy majeſty ride proſperouſly, becauſe of truth and meekneſs, and righteouſneſs: And thy right hand ſhall teach thee terrible things. Thine arrows are ſharp in the heart of the king's enemies, whereby the people fall under thee."
<note n="§" place="bottom">Pſal. xlv. 3, 4, 5.</note> In the next Pſalm, the proſperity of the church is prodicted, which will take place in the Millennium; and the battle by which it will be introduced and effected is alſo deſcribed. "There is a river, the ſtreams whereof ſhall make glad the city of our God. God is in the midſt of her; ſhe ſhall not be moved: God ſhall help her, and that right early. The heathen raged, the kingdoms were moved: He uttered his voice, the earth melted. Come, behold the works of the Lord, what deſolations he hath made in the earth. He maketh wars to ceaſe unto the end of the earth, he breaketh the bow, and cutteth the ſpear in ſunder, he burneth the chariot
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:025635_0123_0FCEACD0C3105128"/>in the fire. Be ſtill, and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the heathen, I will be exalted in the earth."</p>
               <p>The twenty firſt Pſalm contains a prediction of Chriſt, and foretells the deſtruction of the wicked, as introducing his reign on earth, and the proſperity and joy of the church. "Thine hand ſhall find out all thine enemies, thy right hand ſhall find out thoſe that hate thee. Thou ſhalt make them as a fiery oven in the time of thine anger: The Lord ſhall ſwallow them up in his wrath, and the fire ſhall devour them. Their fruit ſhalt thou deſtroy from the earth, and their ſeed from among the children of men: For they intended evil againſt thee; they imagined a miſchievous device, which they are not able to perform. Therefore ſhalt thou make them turn their back, when thou ſhalt make ready thine arrows upon thy ſtrings, againſt the face of them. Be thou exalt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Lord, in thine own ſtrength: So ſhall we ſing and praiſe thy power."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Verſ. 8—13.</note>
               </p>
               <p>That the wicked ſhall be cut off and deſtroyed from the earth, that the ſaints may inherit it, is foretold throughout the thirty ſeventh Pſalm. "Evil doers ſhall be cut off: But thoſe that wait upon the Lord, they ſhall inherit the earth. For yet a little while, and the wicked ſhall not be: Yea, thou ſhalt diligently conſider his place, and it ſhall not be. But the meek ſhall inherit the earth, and delight themſelves in the abundance of peace. Wait on the Lord, and keep his way, and he ſhall exalt thee to inherit the earth: When the wicked are cut off, thou ſhalt ſee it. The tranſgreſſors ſhall be deſtroyed together; the end of the wicked ſhall be cut off. But the ſalvation of the righteous is of the Lord," &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The ſame thing is brought into view in the ſeventy fifth, ſeventy ſixth, and ninety ſeventh Pſalms. "God is the judge, he putteth down one, and ſetteth up another. For in the hand of the Lord there is a cup, and the wine is red; it is full of mixture, and he poureth out of the ſame; but the dregs thereof, all the wicked of the earth ſhall wring them out, and drink them. All the horns of the wicked alſo will I cut off; but the horns of the righteous ſhall be exalted. In Judah, is God known, his name is great in Iſrael. In Salem alſo is his tabernacle, and his dwelling place in Zion. There brake he the arrows of the bow, the ſhield, and the ſword, and the battle. Thou art more glorious and excellent than
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:025635_0124_0FCEACD262EE17C8"/>the mountains of prey. The ſtout hearted are ſpoiled, they have ſlept their ſleep: And none of the men of might have found their hands. At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob, both the chariot and horſe are caſt into a dead ſleep. Thou didſt cauſe judgment to be heard from heaven; the earth feared and was ſtill, when God aroſe to judgment, to ſave all the meek of the earth. He ſhall cut off the ſpirit of princes: He is terrible to the kings of the earth." "The Lord reigneth, let the people rejoice; let the multitude of iſles be glad thereof. Clouds and darkneſs are round about him, righteouſneſs and judgment are the habitation of his throne. A fire goeth before him, and burneth up his enemies round about. His lightnings enlightned the world: The earth ſaw, and tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led. The hills melted like wax at the preſence of the Lord; at the preſence of the Lord of the whole earth. Confounded be all they that ſerve graven images, that boaſt themſelves of idols.— Worſhip him all ye gods." This battle is brought into view, and foretold in the 110th Pſalm. "The Lord ſaid unto my Lord, fit thou at my right hand, until I make thine enemies thy footſtool. The Lord ſhall ſend the rod of thy ſtrength out of Zion; rule thou in the midſt of thine enemies. The Lord at thy right hand ſhall ſtrike through kings in the day of his wrath, (i. e. in the great day of battle.) He ſhall judge among the heathen, he ſhall fill the places with the dead bodies; he ſhall wound the heads over many countries."</p>
               <p>In the prophecy of Iſaiah, this battle, as it has been explained, is often brought into view, as connected with the proſperity of the church of Chriſt on earth, and introductory to it: Some inſtances of this will be mentioned. In the five firſt verſes of the ſecond chapter, there is a prophecy of the happy ſtate of the church in the laſt days, that is, in the Millennium. In the four next verſes is a deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the corruption, worldlineſs and idolatry of the viſible church, and conſequently of the world in general, as the reaſon of the diſpleaſure with them, and his puniſhing them. And from the tenth verſe to the end of the chapter, the manifeſtation of his diſpleaſure, in his fighting againſt them, and puniſhing them, is deſcribed. "Enter into the rock, and hide thee in the duſt, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majeſty. The lofty looks of man ſhall be humbled, and the haughtineſs of men ſhall be bowed down, and the Lord alone ſhall be exalted in that day. For the day of the Lord of hoſts ſhall be upon every one that is
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:025635_0125_0FCEACD44980D0C8"/>proud and lofty, and upon every one that is lifted up, and he ſhall be brought low. And the idols he ſhall utterly aboliſh. And they ſhall go into the holes of the rocks, and into the caves of the earth, for fear of the Lord, and for the glory of his majeſty, when he ariſeth to ſhake terribly the earth."</p>
               <p>The eleventh chapter contains a prediction of the Millennium, and of the ſlaughter of the wicked of the earth, which ſhall make way for it. "With righteouſneſs ſhall he judge the poor, and reprove with equity, for the meek of the earth: And he ſhall ſmite the earth with the rod of his mouth, and with the breath of his ſips ſhall he ſlay the wicked."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Verſe 4.</note> Theſe laſt words are parellel with thoſe in the Revelation, by which this battle, and the effect of it are expreſſed.

               <p>In the thirteenth chapter is a prediction of the ſame thing: "Howlye, for the day of the Lord is at hand; it ſhall come as a deſtruction from the Almighty. Behold, the day of the Lord cometh, cruel both with wrath, and fierce anger, to lay the earth deſolate: And he ſhall deſtroy the ſinners thereof out of it.

               <p>The twenty fourth chapter is wholly on this ſubject, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribes the battle of that great day of God Almighty, and the ſlaughter of the wicked, in clear and ſtriking language, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which, the church and people of God ſhall ſpread and

"Behold, the Lord maketh the earth empty, and maketh it waſte, and turneth it upſide down, and ſcattereth abroad the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants thereof. The earth ſhall be utterly emptied; for the Lord hath ſpoken this word. The earth mourneth and ſadeth away: The world languiſheth and fadeth away: The haughty people of the earth do languiſh. The earth is alſo defiled under the inhabitants thereof, becauſe they have tranſgreſſed the laws, changed the ordinance, broken the everlaſting covenant. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hath the curſe devoured the earth, and they who dwell therein are deſolate: Therefore the inhabitants of the earth are burned, and few men left.

               <p>The prophecy goes on, and the ſame events, as to ſubſtance, and this battle, and the conſequence of it, are deſcribed in other words: "Fear and the pit, and the ſnare are upon thee, O in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant of the earth. The earth is utterly broken down, the earth is clean diſſolved, the earth is moved exceedingly. The earth ſhall reel to and fro like a drunkard, and ſhall be moved like a cottage, and the tranſgreſſion thereof ſhall be heavy upon it, and it ſhall fall, and not riſe again." This battle is deſcribed in the Revelation, in the ſame figurative language: "And there was a great earthquake, ſuch as was not ſince men were upon the earth, ſo mighty an earthquake and ſo great. And every iſland fled a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, and the mountains were not found."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xvi. 18, 20.</note> "And it ſhall come come to paſs in that day, that the Lord ſhall puniſh the hoſt of the high ones that are on high, and the kings of the earth upon the earth. And they ſhall be gathered together as priſoners are gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the pit, and ſhall be ſhut up in the priſon; and after many days ſhall they be viſited.
<note n="†" place="bottom">What is meant by the hoſt of the high ones, and the kings of the earth being <hi>viſited</hi> after many days, is not ſo clear, at firſt view, and perhaps it is not now underſtood. God is often ſaid in ſcripture to <hi>viſit</hi> thoſe whom he puniſhes, and the word here in the original is frequently tranſlated, to puniſh. They who are ſhut up in priſon, are often confined there, to be taken out after ſome days, and receive their puniſhment. When it is here ſaid, "And after many days ſhall they be viſited;" may not the meaning be, that thoſe high ones, and kings of the earth ſhall no more appear in this world; but ſhall be ſhut up in priſon until the day of judgment, when they ſhall be brought forth and puniſhed? As the fallen angels are bound in chains of darkneſs to be reſerved unto judgment, ſo theſe unjuſt men will be reſerved unto the day of judgment, to be puniſhed. When it is ſaid of Zedekiah, that he ſhould be carried a captive to Babylon, it is added, "And there ſhall he be, until I viſit him, ſaith the Lord." Jer. xxxii. 5. That is, until God ſhould take him out of the world by death, and to judgment; ſo that he ſhould never reign as king any more.</note> Then the moon ſhall be confounded, and the ſun aſhamed, when the Lord of hoſts ſhall reign in Mount Zion, and in Jeruſalem, and before his ancients gloriouſly."

<pb n="129" facs="unknown:025635_0128_0FCEACD95F430570"/>themſelves in pride and wickedneſs, and tyrannize over men, and deſcribes their overthrow in this battle. They ſhall be taken as priſoners, be puniſhed for their pride and tyranny, and ſhut up that they may do no more miſchief. Thus God "will cut off the ſpirit of princes, and be terrible to the kings of the earth."

That is, then there ſhall be ſuch ſpiritual light and glory in the flouriſhing of the kingdom of Chriſt on earth, and ſo ſuperiour to all the light and glory of the natural world, as that the latter ſhall be utterly eclipſed, and appear to be worthy of no regard, compared with the former.</p>
               <p>The three next chapters are a continuation of prophecy of the ſame event, viz. the judgments which are to be inflicted on the falſe and degenerate profeſſors of religion, and the world of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general, previous to the proſperity of the church and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Chriſt in the world, which will be evident to the careful judicious reader; and that the predictions contained in them, coincide with thoſe which have been mentioned. It is needleſs to tranſcribe any particular paſſage here, except the following:— "Come, my people, enter thou into thy chambers, and ſhut thy doors about thee; hide thyſelf as it were for a little moment, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the indignation be overpaſſed.

The words which follow thoſe tranſcribed above, are, "In that day, the Lord with his
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:025635_0129_0FCEACDA96CD3C08"/>fore great and ſtrong ſword, ſhall puniſh leviathan the piercing ſerpent, even leviathan that crooked ſerpent, and he ſhall ſlay the dragon that is in the ſea." The ſame event is here predicted, of which there is a prophecy in the twentieth chapter of the Revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, viz. of the dragon that old ſerpent, which is the devil and fatan, being laid hold of, and bound and caſt into the bottomleſs pit. And the ſame conſequence of this with reſpect to the church is here foretold, as is deſcribed there, viz. the proſperity of it, by the ſpecial favour and preſence of God. "In that day ſing ye unto her, A vineyard of red wine. I the Lord do keep it, I will water it every moment: Left any hurt it, I will keep it night and day." While the battle is going on, and God is puniſhing the inhabitants of the earth for their iniquity, his people will be hid as in a ſecret chamber; but when it is over, they will become as a flouriſhing, fruitful vineyard, producing abundance of red wine, in conſequence of the peculiar favour and care of Jeſus Chriſt, and the abundance of heavenly divine influences.</p>
               <p>The thirty fourth, and thirty fifth chapters of Iſaiah, contain a prophecy of the Millennium, and of the day of battle which will precede it, which will conſiſt in the puniſhment of the world for their iniquity. "Come near, ye nations, to hear, and hearken, ye people: Let the earth hear, and all that is therein; the world, and all things that come forth of it. For the indignation of the Lord is upon all nations, and his fury upon all their armies. He hath utterly deſtroyed them, he hath delivered them to the ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. For it is the day of the Lord's vengeance, and the year of recompences for the controverſy of Zion. Strengthen ye the weak hands, confirm the feeble knees. Say to them that are of a fearful heart, Be ſtrong, fear not: Behold, your God will come with vengeance, even God with a recompence; he will come and fave you. Then the eyes of the blind ſhall be opened, and the ears of the deaf ſhall be unſtopped. Then ſhall the lame man leap as an hart, and the tongue of the dumb ſhall ſing; for in the wilderneſs ſhall waters break out, and ſtreams in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert," &amp;c "And the ranſomed of the Lord ſhall return and come to Zion with ſongs, and everlaſting joy upon their heads; they ſhall obtain joy and gladneſs, and ſorrow and ſighing ſhall flee away."</p>
               <p>In the forty firſt chapter of Iſaiah, God, ſpeaking to the church, and promiſing the good things and proſperity which were in ſtore
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:025635_0130_0FCEACDC06476C00"/>for it in the days of the Millennium, ſays, "Behold, all they that are incenſed againſt thee, ſhall be aſhamed and confounded: They ſhall be as nothing, and they that ſtrive with thee, ſhall periſh. Thou ſhalt ſeek them, and ſhall not find them that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with thee: They that war againſt thee, ſhall be as nothing, and as a thing of nought. Behold, I will make thee a new, ſharp threſhing inſtrument, having teeth; thou ſhall threſh the mountains, and beat them ſmall, and make the hills as chaff. Thou ſhalt fan them, and the wind ſhall carry them away, and the whirlwind ſhall ſcatter them: And thou ſhalt rejoice in the Lord, and ſhalt glory in the Holy One of Iſrael."</p>
               <p>In the forty ſecond chapter, God makes promiſes to his church, which are to be accompliſhed in their fulneſs, in the days of the Millennium, and ſpeaks of the war and battle in which he will deſtroy his enemies, to open the way for the good thing which was to be done for the church. "The Lord ſhall go forth as a mighty man, he ſhall ſtir up jealouſy like a man of war: He ſhall cry, yea, roar; he ſhall prevail againſt his enemies. I have long time holden my peace, I have been ſtill, and refrained myſelf: Now will I cry like a travailing woman, I will deſtroy and devour at once. I will make waſte mountains and hills, and dry up all their herbs; and I will make the rivers iſlands, and I will dry up the pools. And I will bring the blind by a way that they knew not, I will lead them in paths that they have not known: I will make darkneſs light before them, and crooked things ſtraight. Theſe things will I do unto them, and not forſake them."</p>
               <p>The fifty ninth and ſixtieth chapters, are wholly on this ſubject of the Millennium. In the fourteen firſt verſes of the fifty ninth chapter, the great degree of wickedneſs of the world of mankind is deſcribed. And then God is repreſented as greatly diſpleaſed, and riſing to battle, to puniſh men for their evil deeds. "And the Lord ſaw it, and it diſpleaſed him that there was no judgment. And he ſaw that there was no man, and he wondered that there was no interceſſor: Therefore, his arm brought ſalvation unto him, and his righteouſneſs, it ſuſtained him. For he put on righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs as a breaſtplate, and an helmit of ſalvation upon his head; and he put on the garments of vengeance for clothing, and was clad with zeal as a cloke. According to their deeds, accordingly he will repay, fury to his adverſaries, recompence to his enemies; to the iſlands he will repay recompence. So ſhall
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:025635_0131_0FCEACDDA1CFFD98"/>they fear the name of the Lord from the weſt, and his glory from the riſing of the ſun. When the enemy ſhall come in like a flood, the Spirit of the Lord ſhall lift up a ſtandard againſt him." And to this battle, this work of judgment and vengeance, ſucceeds the day of light and ſalvation to the church: Thoſe who are left, ſhall repent and humble themſelves, and "fear the name of the Lord from the weſt, and his glory from the riſing of the ſun. And the Redeemer ſhall come to Zion, and to them that turn from tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion in Jacob." It will be then ſaid to the church, "Ariſe, ſhine, for thy light is come, and the glory of the Lord is riſen upon thee."—The prophecy of the Millennium goes on through the ſixtieth, ſixty firſt, and ſixty ſecond chapters.</p>
               <p>There is a parallel repreſentation of this battle in the ſixty third chapter, as executed by the ſame perſon who is exhibited in the nineteenth <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>apter of the Revelation, riding forth to make war in righteouſneſs, and fighting this ſame battle, in which the wicked then on earth will be ſlain. "Who is this that cometh from Edom, with died garments from Bozrah?
<note n="*" place="bottom">Bozrah was in the land of Edom. The Edomites, were implacable enemies to the people of God, and are in the prophecies of Iſaiah, and elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, put for the enemies of God and his church in general, who ſhall be deſtroyed, as the Edomites were, of whom the Edomites, and their deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion were a type.</note> This who is glorious in his apparel, travelling in the greatneſs of his ſtrength? I who ſpeak in righteouſneſs, mighty to ſave. Wherefore art thou red in thine apparel, and thy garments like him who treadeth in the wine fat? I have trodden the wine preſs alone, and of the people there was none with me: For I will tread them in mine anger, and trample them in my fury, and the blood ſhall be ſprinked upon my garments, and I will ſtain all my raiment. For the day of vengeance is in my heart, and the year of my redeemed is come. And I looked, and there was none to help, and I wondered that there was none to uphold: Therefore, mine own arm brought ſalvation unto me, and my fury it upheld me. And I will tread down the people in mine anger, and make them drunk in my fury, and I will bring down their ſtrength to the earth."</p>
               <p>The ſame thing is predicted in the ſixty ſixth chapter: "A voice of noiſe from the city, a voice from the temple, a voice of the Lord who rendereth recompence to his enemies. And the hand of the Lord ſhall be known towards his ſervants, and his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:025635_0132_0FCEACDF531C2E70"/>towards his enemies. For behold, the Lord will come with fire, and with his chariots like a whirlwind, to render his an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger with fury, and his rebuke with flames of fire. For by fire, and by his ſword, will the Lord plead with all fleſh; and the ſlain of the Lord ſhall be many." Theſe predictions of the ſlaughter and deſtruction of the wicked, are here intermixed with promiſes of ſalvation and proſperity to the church: "Rejoice ye with Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, and be glad with her, all ye who love her: Rejoice for joy with her, all ye that mourn for her: That ye may ſuck and be ſatisfied with the breaſts of her conſolations: That ye may milk out, and be delighted with the abundance of her glory. For thus ſaith the Lord, Behold, I will extend peace to her like a river, and the glory of the Gentiles like a flowing ſtream. And when ye fee this, your heart ſhall rejoice, and your bones ſhall flouriſh like an herb."</p>
               <p>A paſſage in the tenth chapter of Jeremiah, ſeems to refer to the ſame event. The folly, idolatry, and great wickedneſs of the people and nations of the earth, is mentioned and deſcribed in the firſt part of the chapter, upon which the following prediction is uttered: But JEHOVAH is the true God, he is the living God, and an everlaſting King: At his wrath the earth ſhall tremble, and the nations ſhall not be able to abide his indignation. Thus ſhall ye ſay unto them, The gods that have not made the heavens, and the earth, even they ſhall periſh from the earth, and from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe heavens."</p>
               <p>In the firſt part of the twenty fifth chapter, there is a prophecy of the captivity of the Jews, and of other adjacent nations, by Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buchadnezzar; and when their captivity during ſeventy years ſhould be ended, Jeremiah foretells the ruin of Babylon, and the land of the Chaldeans. And the evil that was coming on the nations of the earth, which ſhould attend the deſtruction of Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon, is repreſented by ordering Jeremiah to take the wine cup of wrath, and cauſe all the nations of the earth to drink of it. And as the deſtruction of ancient Babylon, and the judgments which came on many other nations, was an eminent type of yet greater and more remarkable deſtruction of ſpiritual Babylon, and of all the nations of the earth, which will attend that, the prophecy is car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried on beyond the type, and looks forward to the antitype, which is common in ſcripture prophecy; and expreſſions are uſed which cannot be applied to the former, to the type, in their full extent
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:025635_0133_0FCEACE0898E9FF0"/>and meaning, but to the latter, the antitype, and therefore the prophecy is accompliſhed but in part, and in a lower degree in the former; but fully and moſt completely in the latter: Therefore, the Prophet goes on, and uſes expreſſions toward the cloſe of the prophecy, which refer chiefly to the battle in which antichriſt, and the nations of the earth will fall. Such are the following: "Therefore, propheſy thou againſt them all thoſe words, and ſay unto them, The Lord ſhall roar from on high, and utter his voice from his holy habitation; he ſhall mightily roar upon his habitation, he ſhall give a ſhout, as they that tread the grapes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all the inhabitants of the earth. A noiſe ſhall come even to the ends of the earth: For the Lord hath a controverſy with the nations: He will plead with all fleſh, he will give them that are wicked to the ſword, ſaith the Lord. Thus ſaith the Lord of hoſts, Behold, evil ſhall go forth from nation to nation, and a great whirlwind ſhall be raiſed up from the coaſts of the earth. And the ſlain of the Lord ſhall be at that day, from one end of the earth, even unto the other end of the earth: They ſhall not be lamented, neither gathered, nor buried; they ſhall be dung upon the ground."

               <p>There is another prophecy of this in the thirtieth chapter of Jeremiah. Here the deliverance of the church from her oppreſſors, and from all her ſufferings and trouble, is promiſed; which ſhall be attended with the utter overthrow and deſtruction of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and all her enemies. That this prophecy looks beyond the deliverance of the Jews from the Babyloniſh captivity, and the evil that came on their enemies then, to the greater deliverance of the church from ſpiritual Babylon, and the general deſtruction of the wicked which ſhall attend it, of which the former was a type, is evident, not only from a number of expreſſions and promiſes which were not ſully accompliſhed in the former, and have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the latter; but from the expreſs promiſe, that God will raiſe up David their king to reign over them, by whom muſt be
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:025635_0134_0FCEACE2177A96F0"/>meant Jeſus Chriſt, the Son of David, and of whom David was an eminent type. This will appear, by attending to the following paſſages: "Alas! For that day is great, ſo that none is like it: It is even the time of Jacob's trouble; but he ſhall be delivered out of it. For it ſhall come to paſs in that day, ſaith the Lord of hoſts, that I will break his yoke from off thy neck, and will burſt thy bonds, and ſtrangers ſhall no more ſerve themſelves of him. But they ſhall ſerve the Lord their God, and David their king, whom I will raiſe up unto them. For I am with thee, ſaith the Lord, to ſave thee. Though I make a full end of all nations whither I have ſcattered thee, yet I will not make a full end of thee. Behold, a whirlwind of the Lord goeth forth with fury, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing whrilwind, it ſhall fall with pain upon the head of the wicked. The fierce anger of the Lord ſhall not return, until he have done it, and until he have performed the intents of his heart: In the latter days ye ſhall conſider it."

               </p>
               <p>In the book of Daniel, there is prophecy of the ſame event. "And at that time," (i. e. when antichriſt is to be deſtroyed, which is predicted in the paragraph immediately preceding theſe words) "ſhall Michael ſtand up, the great Prince who ſtandeth for the children of thy people" (that is, Jeſus Chriſt, who will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port and deliver his church) "And there ſhall be a time of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ſuch as never was fince there was a nation, even to that ſame time," (this is the time of the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

This is the time of the deliverance of the church from the power of antichriſt, and from all wicked men, her enemies, and of her entering upon the proſperous, happy ſtate, in which the ſaints will reign on earth a thouſand years.</p>
               <p>The Prophet Joel ſpeaks of the ſame events. From the twenty eighth verſe of the ſecond chapter of his prophecy, is a prediction of the Millennium, and the preceding evils that ſhall be inflicted on mankind: "And it ſhall come to paſs afterwards, that I will pour out my Spirit upon all fleſh," &amp;c. "This prophecy began to be fulfilled, when the Holy Spirit was firſt poured out after the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cention of Chriſt; but this, as has been before obſerved, was but the firſt fruits, and the prophecy will be fulfilled only in a very ſmall part, before the harveſt ſhall come in the days of the Millennium.
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:025635_0135_0FCEACE44F1C1290"/>At the ſame time he ſpeaks of the great evils, and terrible events which ſhall take place: "The ſun ſhall be turned into darkneſs, and the moon into blood, before the great and terrible day of the Lord come. And it ſhall come to paſs, that whoſoever ſhall call on the name of the Lord, ſhall be delivered." The Prophet goes on in the next chapter to ſpeak more particularly on this ſubject: "For behold, in thoſe days and in that time, when I ſhall bring a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain the captivity of Judah, and Jeruſalem, I will alſo gather all nations, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoſhaphat, and will plead with them there for my people, and for my heritage Iſrael, whom they have ſcattered among the nations, and parted my land."</p>
               <p>Judah and Jeruſalem are put for the church of Chriſt, being a type of that, as has been obſerved. The captivity of the Jews in Babylon, and their return from it, is typical of the afflicted, ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate of the church during the reign of antichriſt, and the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance of it from this ſtate on the fall of antichriſt, and in the Millennium. This is therefore meant, when it is ſaid, "In thoſe days, and in that time, when I ſhall bring again the captivity of Judah and Jeruſalem." When the children of Moab, Ammon, and Edom, came with a great army, combined together to deſtroy Judah, Jehoſhaphat was directed to go forth with the inhabitants of Judah and Jeruſalem and meet them; and had a promiſe that he ſhould have no occaſion to fight with them; but ſhould ſtand ſtill and ſee the ſalvation of the Lord, becauſe the battle was not their's, but God's. Accordingly they went out, and ſtood ſtill, and ſaw their enemies fall upon, and deſtroy each other, until they were all waſted away. Jehoſhaphat and his people went out to their camp, and found great riches, ſilver and gold, and much ſpoil; and they ſpent three days in gathering it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and on the fourth day they aſſembled in the valley to bleſs and praiſe the Lord, which was from that called, "The valley of Berachah." This is the valley of Jehoſhaphat. And to this ſtory, theſe words of the Prophet Joel refer.
<note n="*" place="bottom">See 2 Chron. 20th Chapter.</note> Moab, Ammon, and Edom, the enemies of Iſrael, were a type of the enemies of the church and people of God, under the goſpel diſpenſation, among all nations. This battle and their deſtruction of the enemies of Judah and Jeruſalem in the valley of Jehoſhaphat, was a type of the overthrow of all the enemies of Chriſt and his church, when they ſhall be gathered to the battle of
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:025635_0136_0FCEACE600B7C6E0"/>that great day of God Almighty. This prophecy therefore, is a prediction of the ſame event which is deſcribed in the ſixteenth chapter of the Revelation. Here it is ſaid, "I will gather all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and will bring them down into the valley of Jehoſhaphat, and will plead with them there for my people." That is, will puniſh and deſtroy them for their oppoſition to me and my church. There it is ſaid, "The kings of the earth and of the whole world, were gathered to the battle of that great day. And he gathered them together to a place called in the Hebrew tongue, Armaged<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don." Which paſſage has been before explained.</p>
               <p>The Prophet farther enlarges on this ſubject in the following part of this chapter:
<note n="*" place="bottom">Verie 9, &amp;c.</note> Proclaim ye this among the Gentiles: Prepare war, wake up the mighty men, let all the men of war draw near, let them come up.

Let the heathen be wakened and come up to the valley of Jehoſhaphat; for there will I ſit to judge all the heathen round about.

Multitudes, multitudes, in the valley of deciſion; for the day of the Lord is near in the valley of deciſion. The ſun and moon ſhall be darkened, and the ſtars ſhall withdraw their ſhining. The Lord ſhall alſo roar out of Zion, and utter his voice from Jeruſalem, and the heavens and the earth ſhall ſhake; but the Lord will be the hope of his people, and the ſtrength of the children of Iſrael." Every one who at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends to this paſſage, will obſerve what a ſtriking ſimilitude there is between this deſcription of a battle, and that in the Revelation, which has been conſidered. God is here repreſented as fighting the battle againſt all the heathen, and deſtroying multitudes on multitudes. All the heathen, even all nations are gathered toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, all armed for war, and come up to the valley of Jehoſhaphat, and there are cut off in this valley of deciſion. In the Revelation all the nations of the earth are gathered together to battle at Megiddo, typifying the ſame thing with the valley of Jehoſhaphat, and there they are ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And his name is called, The word of God. And the armies in heaven followed him upon white horſes." Here there is a command to "put in the fickle, for the harveſt is ripe: Come, get you down, for the preſs is full, the fats overflow, for the wickedneſs is great." Much the ſame repreſentation is made of this battle in the Revelation,

The Prophet Joel goes on to the end of his prophecy deſcribing the happy ſtate of the church, which ſhall ſucceed this battle, which has never yet taken place, and is like other deſcriptions of the Millennium ſtate, by the Prophets. "Then ſhall Jeruſalem be holy, and there ſhall no ſtranger paſs through her any more. And it ſhall come <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But Judah ſhall dwell forever, and Jeruſalem from generation to generation."</p>
               <p>The Prophet Micah, propheſied of Chriſt and his kingdom, in the extent and glory of it in the latter day; and of the deſtruction of the wicked men, and the nations of the world, in favour of the church of Chriſt, and in order to the proſperity of his people.— All this is contained in the fifth chapter of his prophecy. "And He (i. e. Chriſt) ſhall ſtand and feed in the ſtrength of the Lord, in the majeſty of the name of the Lord his God: And they ſhall ahide; for now ſhall he be great unto the ends of the earth. And the remnant of Jacob ſhall be among the Gentiles, in the midſt of many people, as a lion among the beaſts of the foreſt, as a young lion among the flocks of ſheep; who if he go through, both treadeth down, and teareth in pieces, and none can deliver.

               <p>The prophecy of Zephaniah has reſpect to the battle of that great day of God Almighty, and the ſucceeding happy and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous ſtate of the church in the Millennium. It has indeed a primary reſpect to the evils and puniſhment brought upon Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem and the Jews by the Chaldeans, for their apoſtacy and idol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atry;
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:025635_0138_0FCEACEA06BFF378"/>and to the calamities and deſtruction which came upon the nations at that time, and previous to the reſtoration of the Jews; and to their reſtoration from their captivity, and return to their own land; which were types of the much greater and more im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant events, in the laſt days, in which all nations will be more immediately concerned; and to which the prophecy has an ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and chief reſpect. It was fulfilled but in part, and in a ſmall degree, in the former events; and will have the chief and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete accompliſhment in the latter; as has been before obſerved concerning other prophecies of the ſame kind. Jeruſalem in her moſt pure ſtate, when the ſtatutes and ordinances which God had preſcribed, were in ſome good degree obſerved, was a type of the true church of Chriſt. Therefore, under this name, and that of Mount Zion, and Iſrael, the Prophets ſpeak of the true church in all future ages. But Jeruſalem, conſidered in her moſt corrupt ſtate of apoſtacy, was a type of the falſe church of Rome, and of all chriſtian churches when they apoſtatize from the holy doctrines and precepts of the goſpel. Therefore, Chriſt is ſaid to be cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in the great city, by which is meant the apoſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xi. 8.</note> The nations round about the land of Iſrael and Judea, and all thoſe who at times afflicted and oppreſſed the viſible people of God, and were enemies to them; were types of the enemies of the church of Chriſt, in the time of her affliction; eſpecially of all the idolatrous nations and wicked men, who oppoſe the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of the church, and are to be deſtroyed, in order to her deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erance and ſalvation. With theſe obſervations in view, this proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecy may be read, and the whole of it applied to the battle and events which will take place previous to the introduction of the Millennium, predicted in the Revelation, under the ſeventh vial; and to the proſperity of the church which will then commence. Then it will have its full accompliſhment; and many of the expreſſions in it, conſidered in their moſt natural and extenſive meaning, cannot be accommodated to any events which have taken place, and are not yet fulfilled. Some of theſe will be now mentioned. The prophecy begins with the following words:—

That day is a day of wrath, a day of trouble and diſtreſs, a day of waſteneſs and deſolation, a day of darkneſs and gloomineſs, a day of clouds and thick darkneſs, a day of the trumpet and alarm againſt the ſenced cities, and againſt the high towers. And I will bring diſtreſs upon men, that they ſhall walk like blind men, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they have ſinned againſt the Lord: And their blood ſhall be poured out as duſt, and their fleſh as dung. Neither their ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, nor their gold, ſhall be able to deliver them in the day of the Lord's wrath; but the whole land (earth) ſhall be devoured by the fire of his jealouſy: For he ſhall make even a ſpeedy riddance of all them that dwell in the land (earth.)

Therefore, wait upon me, ſaith the Lord, until the day that I riſe up to the prey; for my determina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to gather the nations, that I may aſſemble the kingdoms, to pour upon them mine indignation, and all my fierce anger:— For all the earth ſhall be devoured with the fire of my jealouſy." The parallel and likeneſs between this prophecy, and that of the battle in the Revelation, is worthy of particular notice. This is called "The great day of the Lord: The day of the Lord's wrath: A day of diſireſs and deſolation: The day that God will riſe up to the prey, to <hi>gather</hi> the nations, and aſſemble the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms, to pour upon them his indignation, and fierce anger."— In the Revelation, the whole world were gathered to the battle of that great day of God Almighty.

"And he gathered them together into a place, called in the Hebrew tongue, Armageddon. And the ſeventh angel poured out his vial (of wrath) into the air. And there were voices, and thunders, and lightnings; and there was a great earthquake, ſuch as was not ſince men were upon the earth, ſo mighty an earthquake and ſo great.

This is the gathering of the kingdoms and nations of the whole world, unto the battle, by the unclean ſpirits which go forth to corrupt the world, and arm them againſt God, and his people, by the practice of all kinds of wickedneſs, by which the beſt part of the church will be greatly corrupted; and the ſaints will ſuffer very much, being beſieged on all ſides by very wicked men, mentioned in the Revelation,

               <p>It appears reaſonable and proper, that God ſhould manifeſt his diſpleaſure with the inhabitants of Chriſtendom, and of the world, for their long continued abuſe of his goodneſs, and of all the means uſed with them to reclaim them; and their perſeverance in their oppoſition to Chriſt and his people, and increaſing in all kinds of wickedneſs, while he has been waiting upon them, even to long ſuffering; by inflicting on them ſevere and awful judgments, and remarkably fearful puniſhments, to vindicate the honour of his own name; and avenge his church and people, who have been ſo greatly injured, deſpiſed and trampled upon; and that it may be made known by this, as well as in other ways, that the God of chriſtians, the God and Saviour revealed in the Bible, is the true God. And this will give great inſtruction to thoſe who ſhall be left, who will have a heart to perceive and underſtand. They will have before their eyes a leſſon, ſuited moſt effectually to teach them the exceeding depravity and wickedneſs of man; and how real and dreadful is the divine diſpleaſure and anger with ſinners: How undone and utterly loſt forever, all men are, without a Redeemer and Sanctifier; by whom they may be recovered from the power of ſin and ſatan, and obtain the forgiveneſs of their ſins, and the favour of God: How dependent they are on ſovereign grace for all good, for every thing better than complete deſtruction; by which alone they are diſtinguiſhed from thoſe who perſevere in their ſins, and periſh. And all this will tend to guard them againſt ſin, to promote their repentance and humiliation, and to lead
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:025635_0144_0FCEACF39FEA8840"/>them to more earneſt, conſtant and united prayer to God for mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, than was ever exerciſed before by men: And to aſcribe all the favours they ſhall receive, which will then be much more abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant than ever before, to the free, ſovereign grace of God; and to give him the praiſe of all.</p>
               <p>In the beginning of this ſection it was ſuggeſted, that by attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the events which are to take place, according to ſcripture prophecy, before the commencement of the Millennium, farther evidence would come into view, that this will not be much ſooner or later, than the beginning of the ſeventh millenary of the world. This evidence has been now produced. The ſixth vial is now running, and probably began to be poured out before the end of the laſt century, and will continue to run a conſiderable part of the next century; under which the power of antichriſt is to be greatly weakened, and the way prepared for his utter overthrow: And at the ſame time, the chriſtian world, and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind in general, will be ſo far from reforming, that they will grow more and more corrupt in doctrine and practice, and greedily run into all manner of vice and wickedneſs, until they are prepared for the battle of that great day, and ripe to be cut down and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, by a ſeries of divine judgments, which will be inflicted under the ſeventh vial, and will iſſue in the introduction of the Millennium.</p>
               <p>The river Euphrates has been drying up, and the way has been preparing, for near a century paſt, for the utter ruin of the Pope and the hierarchy of the church of Rome, and the time of the utter overthrow of antichriſt appears to be haſtening on. But this is not accompanied with any reformation in that church, or in the Greek church, or in the proteſtant churches in general: But very much to the contrary appears. Ignorance, error and deluſion, and open vice and wickedneſs abound, and are increaſing; and infidelity is rapidly ſpreading in the chriſtian world. The unclean ſpirits, like frogs, appear to have gone forth to all the kings' courts, and the great men in Chriſtendom; and the greateſt corruption and abominable vices are ſpread among them, and real chriſtianity is neglected, run down and oppoſed. And the multitude in general, both learned and unlearned, are going the ſame way. Deiſm, and a multitude of errors which lead to it, and even to atheiſm, are increaſing. A ſpirit of irreligion, ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, pride and worldlineſs, is exceeding ſtrong and prevalent, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:025635_0145_0FCE9E51EEC58A90"/>all kinds of wickedneſs, and a ſtrong and general oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to true religion, and the great truths and doctrines of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. And the healthen world are no more diſpoſed to become chriſtians, than they ever were: And the way to their converſion to chriſtianity appears to be more obſtructed; and the few at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts that are made to chriſtianize any of them, are generally unſucceſsful. And Mahometans and Jews hate and oppoſe chriſtianity as much as ever they did, if not more, and are ſinking farther down in ſtupidity, ignorance, infidelity, worldlineſs, and all kinds of vice.</p>
               <p>It is certain, that moſt of the evil things now mentioned, have been found among the body of mankind, in a greater or leſs degree, in all ages; and the pious friends of God, and true religion, have complained of, and lamented them. And it is probable, that the repreſentation now made, will be conſidered by many, only as the revival of the old complaint, by thoſe who are of an illiberal, gloomy caſt of mind, and wholly without foundation, in truth and fact. But this opinion, though it ſhould be generally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed, and aſſerted with great confidence, will not be any evidence that the repreſentation is not true and juſt; but will rather ſerve to confirm it. For it is commonly, if not always, the caſe, that in times of great degeneracy, and the prevalence of ignorance, error and vice, they who are the greateſt inſtances of it, and moſt ſunk into darkneſs and deluſion, are deluded in this alſo, and entertain a good opinion of themſelves, and of others who join with them, being ignorant of their true character. They put darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs, and call evil good, and good evil. And while real chriſtianity and true virtue, founded upon principles of truth and genuine piety, are abandoned, oppoſed and forſaken, they perceive it not, but think all is well, and much better than before. And they may undertake to <hi>reform chriſtianity,</hi> and think it is greatly reformed, when every doctrine and duty is excluded from it, which is contrary to the ſelfiſhneſs, pride, and worldly ſpirit of man, and little or nothing is left of it, but the mere name, to diſtinguiſh it from the religion of infidels or hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then; and nothing to render it preferable to theſe.</p>
               <p>An appeal muſt be made, in this caſe, from the judgment of thoſe of this character, to thoſe who are born of the Spirit of God; are created in Chriſt Jeſus unto good works; by which they are become new creatures, and turned from the darkneſs of this world,
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:025635_0146_0FCEACF705D3F950"/>to marvellous light: Who are not conformed to this world, but have overcome it, and are transformed by the renewing of their minds, ſo as to know and diſtinguiſh what is that good and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable and perfect will of God, which is revealed in the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. They who are thus ſpiritual, judge of all things reſpecting the doctrines and duties of chriſtianity, in ſome good meaſure, according to the truth. To ſuch, eſpecially thoſe of them who have a general knowledge of the ſtate of religion in the chriſtian world, and of the deluge of ignorance, error and vice with which it is overflowed, it is preſumed, the above deſcription will not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear exaggerated, and that there are greater ſtrides, and ſwifter progreſs made in infidelity, and irreligion, error and falſe religon, in vice and all kinds of wickedneſs, than have been ever known before; and that all theſe are more common, have a wider ſpread, and are carried to a higher degree at this time, than in former ages; and threaten to bear down all truth, and real chriſtianity before them: And that the appearance of things, in this reſpect, is juſt ſuch as might be reaſonably expected when the unclean ſpirits like frogs, the ſpirits of devils, are gone forth with a licenſe and deſign to ſpread their influence among men, and deceive and corrupt the whole world.</p>
               <p>There is reaſon to conclude, from what has already taken place of this kind, and from the prophecy of theſe unclean ſpirits, that they have not yet finiſhed their work; but that the world, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially that part of it called chriſtian and proteſtant, will yet make greater and more rapid advances, in all kinds of moral corruption, and open wickedneſs, till it will come to that ſtate in which it will be fully ripe, and prepared to be cut down by the fickle of divine juſtice and wrath: And it may take near half a century from this time for theſe evil ſpirits to complete their work, and gather the world to this battle. But during this time, whether it be longer or ſhorter, and before the battle ſhall come on, there will probably be great and remarkable judgments, and fore, unuſual and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing calamities, in one place and another, ſuited to awaken and warn mankind, and lead them to fear God, repent and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; which being by moſt diſregarded and abuſed, will become the occaſion of greater hardneſs of heart and obſtinacy, which will be a prelude and provocation to the battle of that great day, in which mankind will be deſtroyed in the manner, and to the degree, which has been deſcribed above. This battle, as has been before
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:025635_0147_0FCEACF884D61150"/>obſerved, will not be fought and finiſhed at once; but by a ſeries of different and increaſing calamities and ſore puniſhments, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind will be reduced and brought down, and every high thing levelled to the ground, in which the hand of God will be remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably viſible, and his arm of power and vengeance made bare.— And it may take more than a century to effect all this, in the wiſeſt and beſt manner; ſo that it will not be finiſhed till near the beginning of the ſeventh millenary of the world.</p>
               <p>It has been obſerved, that while antichriſt is coming down, and the way preparing for the utter extinction of the church of Rome, and all her appendages, the world in general, and eſpecially the chriſtian world, will make ſwift advances in deluſion and all kinds of wickedneſs; and infidelity will make great progreſs, under the influence of the ſpirits of devils, which are gone forth to the whole world. And it may be here obſerved, that the increaſe and ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this wickedneſs, and ſpirit of infidelity, will doubtleſs be the means or weakening and preparing the way for the overthrow of that church. The ten horns, or kings, which ſhall hate the whore, and make her deſolate and naked, and eat her fleſh, and burn her with fire, will do this from a ſelfiſh, worldly ſpirit, and under the influence of infidelity, and oppoſition to all kinds of religion. And the prevalence of deiſm and atheiſm in popiſh countries and nations, which are the natural fruit and offspring of the abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble practices and tyranny of the antichriſtian church, has been the means of expoſing the ſuperſtition and wickedneſs of that church, and weakening the papal hierarchy. And deiſts, and other wicked men, may be made the inſtruments of pulling down that anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian fabrick yet farther; as the heathen Romans were of deſtroying the corrupt church of Iſrael. If ſo, the fall of the Pope will be ſo far from implying a revival of true religion; that it may be attended with the contrary, viz. infidelity, immorality, and all kinds of wickedneſs, as the means of it, ſo far as it will be effected by the inſtrumentality of men.</p>
               <p>WHEN John is deſcribing the viſion under the ſixth vial, of the unclean ſpirits like frogs, going forth to the whole world to gather them to the battle, he ſtops before he has finiſhed the relation, and Jeſus Chriſt himſelf ſpeaks the following words: "Behold, I come as a thief. Bleſſed is he that watcheth and keepeth his gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, leſt he walk naked, and they ſee his ſhame."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xvi. 15.</note> By which
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:025635_0148_0FCEACFB1CC697A8"/>he warns thoſe in particular, who ſhall live when this vial is pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, of their danger of being ſeduced by thoſe evil ſpirits, and thoſe who are corrupted by them, and behaving unworthy of their chriſtian character; and ſets before them the ſtrongeſt motives to deter them from apoſtacy, and induce them to be faithful to him, to <hi>watch and keep their garments:</hi> To continue ſpirituaily awake, and properly attentive to all thoſe things which concern them as chriſtians; to their ſituation and ſtate, their own exerciſes and conduct, to the cauſe of Chriſt, and the enemies with whom they are ſurrounded; to maintain their chriſtian profeſſion, and act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to it, in the exerciſe of all chriſtian graces; truſting in the great Captain and General, who only can ſave them, and his church; and waiting for him with a patient continuance in well doing. <hi>He comes as a thief.</hi> The thief does not make his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence and deſigns known to any but thoſe who are joined with him, being his friends, and engaged in the ſame deſign with him. So, though Chriſt be preſent with his church and people, and is in the midſt of his enemies, having all men and devils in his hands; and ordering and conducting every thing that is done by them, in this time of the greateſt degeneracy, and high handed wickedneſs; and knows how to anſwer his own ends by it and them, and to protect his people, and bring the wheel over his enemies; yet, in this his coming and preſence, he is not ſeen or thought of by the corrupt, wicked world: They think nothing of his preſence, and ſee not his hand: He is ſeen only by his friends, who are engaged in the ſame cauſe with him, who watch and keep their garments. They ſee his hand in all thoſe things, behold him preſent, and doing his own work; and are protected from all evil by him, while the wicked fall into miſchief, and are deſtroying themſelves. And when he comes forth to the battle, and riſes up to the prey, and to puniſh the world for their wickedneſs, the wicked will not ſee him, they will not know their danger, or believe he is come, or will come, till evil falls upon them, and it is too late to eſcape. "For when they ſhall ſay, Peace and ſafety; then ſudden de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction cometh upon them; and they ſhall not eſcape."

               <p>IT will probably be ſuggeſted, that the repreſentation of ſuch a dark ſcene, and evil time, to take place before the Millennium will come, is maſter of great diſcouragement, and tends to damp the ſpirits and hopes of chriſtians, and to diſcourage them from at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting to promote it, or praying for it; eſpecially as it is ſet ſo far off from our day: So that none in this or the next generation are like to ſee it.</p>
               <p>To ſuch ſuggeſtions it is eaſy to reply,</p>
               <p n="1">1. If it be true, and clearly and abundantly foretold, that ſuch evils are to take place, before the proſperous ſtate of the church comes on, it is proper and deſirable that all ſhould know it, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to it, and it cannot be of any diſadvantage to any, to know the truth in this caſe, but the contrary. This is revealed to the church for the inſtruction and benefit of chriſtians, that they may be informed and warned of what is coming, and be prepared for it, and not he diſappointed in their expectations, and ſurpriſed when it ſhall take place; but when they ſee theſe things coming to paſs, their faith may be ſtrengthened, and they lift up their heads and rejoice, knowing that the redemption, the deliverance and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of the church draweth near.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe evils, both natural and moral, however undeſirable and dreadful, in themſelves, are neceſſary for the greateſt good of
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:025635_0150_0FCEACFDD71EDE78"/>the church of Chriſt, and to introduce the Millennium in the beſt manner, and there will be then, and forever, more holineſs, joy and happineſs, than if theſe evils had never taken place. In this view, they are kind and merciful diſpenſations to the church. The Apoſtles and Prophets, and all the inhabitants of heaven, are repreſented as rejoicing in the evils, the puniſhment and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the enemies of Chriſt and his church.
<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xviii. 20. xix. 1—6.</note> The affliction and ſervitude of the children of Iſrael in Egypt, and the wickedneſs, oppreſſion and cruelty exerciſed towards them by Pharaoh and the Egyptians; and the ſucceſſive calamities and puniſhments brought on them by the hand of God, and their final overthrow and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in the Red Sea, were an unſpeakable advantage to the former, and afforded matter of joy and praiſe. Therefore, chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians may now not only acquieſce, but even rejoice in theſe events, as ordered by God for wiſe ends, and neceſſary, in order to the greateſt diſplay of his righteouſneſs and goodneſs, and to promote the beſt good and greateſt happineſs of his church.</p>
               <p n="3">3. God revealed to Abraham the evils which were coming on his poſterity in Egypt, previous to their deliverance and proſperity, and the wickedneſs and puniſhment of the Egyptians; not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage him, and fink his ſpirit, but to ſupport and animate him, and ſtrengthen his faith; and this did not damp his joy; but in the view of the whole, he rejoiced. And Jeſus Chriſt foretold to his diſciples the great evils which were coming on them, upon the Jews, the church and the world, not to diſcourage and deject them, but that they might be forewarned, and expect them, ſo as not to be diſappointed when they came, but have their faith confirmed, and poſſeſs their ſouls in patience when the dark ſcene ſhould come on; and that they might be encouraged and rejoice, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe events as tokens that their deliverance was at hand. He therefore ſaid unto them, "And when theſe things begin to come to paſs, then look up, and lift up your heads; for your redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion draweth nigh."
<note n="†" place="bottom">Luke xxi. 28.</note> This may be applied to chriſtians now. While you ſee the world gathering to the battle of the great day of God Almighty, and view this battle near at hand, lift up your heads and rejoice, that the church has got ſo near the end of dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and affliction; and that the happy day of her deliverance and proſperity is ſo near at hand.</p>

4. As to the diſtance of that happy day of ſalvation from this time; two hundred years, or near ſo many, will paſs off before it will arrive, according to the calculation which has been made from ſcripture; ſo that none, now on the ſtage of life, will live to ſee and enjoy it on earth. But much may be done by chriſtians who live in this age, to promote its coming on in the proper time, by prayer, and promoting the intereſt of religion, and the converſion of ſinners: For that good day would not come, unleſs the cauſe of Chriſt be maintained to that time, and ſinners be converted to keep up the church, and prevent the total extinction of it. In order to this, thouſands muſt be converted, and there muſt be a ſucceſſion of profeſſing and real chriſtians down to that day. The doctrines, inſtitutions, and duties of chriſtianity, muſt be main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained; and there will doubtleſs be remarkable revivals of religion in many places, and knowledge will increaſe among true chriſtians, and there will be advances made in the purity of doctrines and worſhip, and all holy practice, by bringing all theſe nearer to the ſtandard of the holy ſcriptures: And the churches will be formed into a greater union with each other; being more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed to the divine pattern, contained in the Bible. Here then is work enough to do, by thoſe who deſire and are looking for ſuch a day, to prepare the way for it, and it may be introduced in the proper time; and there is no want of encouragement to do it, even in this view, to be ſtedfaſt and unmoveable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, for as much as they may know, that their labour will not be in vain in the Lord.

               <p>And chriſtians may now have a great degree of enjoyment of that day, and joy in it, though they do not expect to live on earth till it ſhall come. True chriſtians are diſintereſted and benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent to ſuch a degree, that they can enjoy and rejoice in the good of others, even thoſe who may live many ages hence, and in the good and proſperity of the church, and the advancement of the cauſe and kingdom of Chriſt in this world, though they ſhould not live to ſee it. The ſtronger their faith is, that this good day is coming, and the clearer and more conſtant view they have of it, and the more deſirable it appears to them, that there ſhould be ſuch a time; the higher enjoyment, and greater joy they will have in it, and in the proſpect of it. Thus Abraham looked forward by his faith, and ſaw this day of Chriſt, when all the nations of the
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:025635_0152_0FCEAD018FBFD470"/>earth ſhould be bleſſed in him, and derived great comfort and joy in this proſpect. "Your father Abraham rejoiced to ſee my day; and he ſaw it, and was glad."

The ſpirits of the juſt made perfect are with the angels, and muſt know all that paſſes in their preſence; and muſt rejoice in ſuch an event, as much or more than they.

               <p>ON the whole, it is hoped that it does appear from what has been ſaid in this diſſertation, that there will be a thouſand years of proſperity of the church of Chriſt, in this world; that this is abundantly foretold and held up to view in the Bible; that this will be about the ſeventh millenary of the world; that it will be a moſt happy and glorious day, in which the chriſtian diſpenſation ſhall have its proper and full effect on earth, in the ſalvation of men; to which all the preceding times and events are preparatory: That the degeneracy and increaſing prevalence of ignorance, error and wickedneſs now in the world, eſpecially in Chriſtendom, is preparing for, and haſtening on the battle of that great day of God Almighty, in which mankind will be puniſhed, and the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part then on earth deſtroyed; and then the Millennium will be introduced:—That this is an important and pleaſing ſubject, ſuited to ſupport and comfort chriſtians in all the dark and evil days which precede it, and to excite them to earneſt, conſtant, united prayer for this coming of Chriſt, and patient waiting for him, and to conſtant exertions in all proper ways, to promote his intereſt and kingdom in the world.</p>
               <p>AFTER the thouſand years of the reign of Chriſt and his church on earth, "Satan ſhall be looſed out of his priſon, and ſhall go out to deceive the nations which are in the four quarters of the earth, Gog and Magog, to gather them together to battle: The number of whom is as the ſand of the ſea. And they went up on the breadth of the earth, and compaſſed the camp of the ſaints about, and the beloved city: And fire came down from God out of heaven, and devoured them."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. xx. 7, 8, 9.</note> In theſe words there is refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to what is ſaid of Gog and Magog, in the thirty eighth and thirty ninth chapters of Ezekiel: Which prophecy, there is reaſon to think, is not to be underſtood literally, but in a figurative ſenſe; as no events have ever taken place anſwerable to this repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, if taken in a literal ſenſe. The prophecy of Gog and Magog,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:025635_0154_0FCEAD0478C93758"/>may be conſidered as having reference to two events, which are to take place at different times, and are ſimilar in ſome reſpects, and differ in others, viz. The great and general corruption and wickedneſs of mankind, and their puniſhment and deſtruction which will precede the Millennium, which has been deſcribed in this ſection; and the apoſtacy and wickedneſs of mankind at the end of the Millennium, and the remarkable overthrow and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them, when Chriſt ſhall come to judgment; predicted in the words which have been now tranſcribed. Some things ſaid of Gog and Magog, of their deſigns, doings, and their puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and a number of expreſſions in that prophecy, are more applicable to the former of theſe events than to the latter, and ſome more applicable to the latter than to the former, and the whole cannot be well applied to one, excluſive of the other; but in both, the prophecy is completely fulfilled. Both theſe events reſpect wicked men, who have arrived to a great degree of obſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and wickedneſs; and they are both gathered together by the agency and deception of ſatan, let looſe for that end. And they are both gathered together to battle againſt Chriſt and his church; and are deſtroyed in the battle.</p>
               <p>This prophecy is figurative. It is not to be ſuppoſed that all this great multitude will be gathered together into one place; or that the church will be encamped together in one ſpot on earth, or collected in one city: But the gathering of the wicked, means their being abandoned to infidelity, and a very great degree of wickedneſs, in oppoſition to the church of Chriſt, and true religion, and being diſpoſed to extirpate theſe from the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>te of the earth. In this ſenſe, the wicked will be gathered together to battle, before the Millennium, by the ſpirits of devils, or ſatan, who will go forth to the whole world for that end, as has been explained. The church will become ſmall, and ſurrounded and aſſaulted by the wicked on every ſide, and ready to be ſwallowed up, and totally deſtroyed by them.</p>
               <p>It has been a queſtion, from whence this multitude of peopl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> Chriſt and true religion had prevailed in the world a thouſand years? Some have ſuppoſed, that a number of people, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps whole nations, would live in ſome corner of the earth, during
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:025635_0155_0FCEAD068E12EBA8"/>the time of the Millennium, without partaking of any of the bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of it; but will continue in a ſtate of heatheniſm and wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs all that time, till at length they will multiply ſo much, as to be able to riſe in oppoſition to the church, and deſtroy it, were they not prevented by the miraculous interpoſition of heaven. And many have ſuppoſed, that this fact is inconſiſtent with all the inhabitants of the world being real chriſtians, and eminently holy in the time of the Millennium. But this ſuppoſed difficulty may be eaſily ſolved; and the general and great apoſt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> accounted for, conſiſtent with the ſuppoſition, that in the Millennium all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind will be real chriſtians. Near the end of the thouſand years, the divine influences, which produced and continued the univerſal and eminent holineſs in the Millennium, may be in ſuch a meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure withheld, as that real chriſtians will, in their exerciſes and conduct, fink much below what had taken place before, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge a careleſs and worldly ſpirit to a great and ſinful degree, and become more and more negligent of their duty, eſpecially with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to their children; and be really guilty of breaking covenant with God, in this important point. In conſequence of this, their children will not be regenerated and converted; but grow up in a ſtate of ſin, real enemies to God and to the truth. And as the world will be then full of people, it will in this way ſoon become full of wicked men, and the church will be very ſmall. And thoſe who will grow up under the power of ſin and ſatan, in the face of all that light, truth and holineſs, which had taken place through the Mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lennium, and in oppoſition to it, will naturally arrive to a great and amazing degree of hardneſs and obſtinacy in ſin, and become a far more guilty and perverſe generation of men, than ever exiſted before; and will be greater enemies to truth and righteouſneſs, and the church of Chriſt. And conſequently will be united and engaged to baniſh all theſe from the earth. The world will have more wicked perſons in it than ever before; and all theſe much more ſinful, and engaged in all kinds and ways of oppoſition to Chriſt and his cauſe and people. The church will be on the brink of ruin, juſt ready to ſink and be ſwallowed up; and the appearance and coming of Chriſt will be leſs believed, expected or thought of, than at any other time. Then Chriſt will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed from heaven in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them who know not God, and obey not the goſpel.</p>

This apoſtacy and great wickedneſs of ſo many millions of mankind, the number of whom will be as the ſand of the ſea, and their conſequent miſery, is an awful diſpenſation indeed, and is, in itſelf, an evil infinitely beyond the comprehenſion of man. But there is the cleareſt evidence, and the greateſt certainty, that this inſtance of evil, as well as all other evil which precedes it, and will ſucceed it, though it will be endleſs, will, by the overruling hand of God, be productive of overbalancing good; and is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, in order to effect the greateſt poſſible good to the univerſe. "<hi>Surely</hi> the wrath of man ſhall praiſe thee: The remainder of wrath ſhalt thou reſtrain."
<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm lxxvi. 10.</note> This event will ſerve to ſet the total depravity, and the ſtrong propenſity of man to the greateſt degree of wickedneſs, in a more clear and ſtriking light than it had been, or perhaps could be before. That man ſhould apoſtatize, and ſo ſoon arrive to ſuch a high degree of wickedneſs, after all the light and holineſs, and the wonderful goodneſs of God to man, diſplayed in the Millennium; and, in oppoſition to all this light and grace, and in the greateſt abuſe of it, join in rebellion againſt God, and trample on his authority, truth and goodneſs, contrary to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monitions and warnings from the word of God, and all faithful miniſters and chriſtians; will make a new diſcovery, and greater than was ever made before, of fallen human nature, and of the great and deſperate evil that is in the heart of man; and that it is utterly incurable by any means that can poſſibly be uſed, ſhort of the almighty energy of the Spirit of God, by which the heart is renewed; and conſequently of the guilt and infinite ill deſert of man; which diſcovery will be of great advantage to the church and kingdom of Chriſt forever, and neceſſary for the greateſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and glory of it, and the higheſt honour of the Redeemer.</p>
               <p>And this will make, from fact, a new and greater diſcovery of the abſolute dependence of man on the grace and Spirit of God, to prevent his greateſt wickedneſs and endleſs deſtruction, and to form him to holineſs and happineſs; and of the great and ſover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign grace of God, in converting and ſaving loſt man, and in bringing on ſuch a wonderful degree of holineſs and happineſs, and continuing it a thouſand years; and that this is all to be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed to the ſovereign power and grace of God, who has mercy on whom he will have mercy, and whom he will he hardeneth.
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:025635_0157_0FCEAD08F9C8B598"/>When all men ſhall be righteous and holy from generation to generation for a thouſand years, and all the children which ſhall be born in that time, ſhall appear to be pious and holy as ſoon as they begin to act, and perſevere in this to the end of life, the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance will be, that mankind are now grown better, and that the evil nature of man is not ſo great; but he is naturally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to obedience and holineſs: The ſudden and great apoſtacy which will take place, will take off this appearance; and ſhow, that the heart of man is naturally as full of evil as ever it was; and that all the good and holineſs of the Millennium ſtate, was the effect of the power of the Spirit of God, and to be wholly aſcribed to the infinite, ſovereign grace of God. And this diſcovery will be remembered by the redeemed forever, and improved to the glory of God, to the praiſe of rich, ſovereign grace, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently to their own eternal advantage.</p>
