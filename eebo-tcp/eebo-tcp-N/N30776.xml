            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Vice of Intemperance is ſuch an Enemy to all that is Virtuous and Religious in Man, yea, to all that is De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent and Man-like, that all Mankind ought to riſe up with Indignation againſt it, as a Thing that degrades them from the Honour of Human Nature, and renders them more vile than the very Beaſts.</p>
            <p>The poor ſenſeleſs Brutes may by Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cident be overcome with ſtrong Liquors, becauſe they have no Reaſon to govern their Appetites, no Senſe of Duty or Shame, no Foreſight of Danger, nor Fear of a future Judgment: And when the Dog turns to his Vomit, or the Swine wallows in the Mire, they do but act according to their Nature. But for the noble Creature MAN, that is made after the Image of
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:040813_0003_10168C6D9423E628"/>
GOD, and ranked in Dignity next to the glorious Angels: Man, that has Reaſon to inform him in the Will of his Creator, and a Conſcience to awaken his Care to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with it; yea, for a Chriſtian, that has the Vows of God upon him, and ſtands fair for an eternal Kingdom; I ſay, for this wiſe and noble Creature to part with his Reaſon, his Conſcience, his Heaven; his God, for a little Drink more than he needs, yea, for ſuch an Exceſs of it as tends to his preſent Pain, Diſorder, and Shame, as well as to eternal Torment, is a moſt deſperate Pitch of Sin and Folly, ſuch as all People, when in their Senſes, cannot chooſe but condemn even with Paſſion; and every body muſt grant, that no Kindneſs in the VVorld can be more ſeaſonable or more valuable, than that which tends to lift Men out of the Mire of this noiſome Sin, and to bring them to the ſweet and honourable Eſtate of Chriſtian Sobriety.</p>
            <p>And this is the VVork of our bleſſed Religion, according to that Exhortation of the Holy Scriptures, <hi>Eph.</hi> v.18. <hi>Be not drunk with Wine, wherein is Exceſs; but be filled with the ſpirit.</hi> As if it were ſaid. Know your divine Advantages, ye
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:040813_0004_10168C72B2459160"/>
that live in the State of the Goſpel, and be not as Swine, which trample the richeſt Paerls under their Feet. Ye, who now Rave and Blaſpheme by Reaſon of Exceſs of Wine, may, by a due Uſe of the Means of Grace, come to be filled with the holy Spirit, and to be happy in the Service and Favour of God, like the holy Angels. Wherefore conſider the infinite Value of your heavenly Birthright, and do not ſell it, with <hi>Eſau,</hi> for a few ſenſual Draughts, leſt, with him, when you come to ſee the Folly of it, ye weep bitterly, and perhaps eternally.</p>
            <p>It is the Miſery of fallen Man, that his Soul is ſunk into the Fleſh, and is prone to follow carnal Inclinations, yea, to <hi>make Proviſion for the Fleſh, to fulfil the Luſts thereof</hi>; which is, both in Nature and Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, as abſurd and horrible as for a Prince to wait on his Slave, or for a Man to be trampled under the Feet of his Horſe. Now, it is the Work of Reaſon, Religion, and the Grace of God, to amend this Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, by reducing the lower Faculties of the Soul into a juſt Obedience to the ſuperior, and making both of them ſubject and obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to the Will and Glory of God. And whereas ſenſual Pleaſures are the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:040813_0005_10168C754E8CD698"/>
uſual Baits whereby Men are enſnared to Intemperance, and as it were bewitched to it, thro' the Inordinacy and Folly of their fleſhly Minds, it is abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to Salvation, that through the pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful Aſſiſtance of the holy Spirit of God in the due Obſervance of the Goſpel Rules of Temperance, Abſtinence, and Mortification, our Bodies ſhould be kept in ſuch Order and Regulation, that they may be fit Inſtruments of our Souls in our Endeavours to ſerve and glorify God. And herein conſiſts the Virtue and Grace of Sobriety, namely, in preſcribing juſt Bounds to ſenſual Pleaſure; that we be not drawn to Exceſs in Eating, Drinking, or other natural Actions, thro' the Entice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met of thoſe agreeable Pleaſures that at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend them.</p>
            <p>As to the particular Caſe before us, that of Drinking to exceſs; it hath pleaſed God to make many Sorts of Liquors guſtful and pleaſant to our Taſte, that we might thereby be induced to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the Goodneſs of God, who gives us of his good Ceatures, as well for our Delight, as for our Neceſſity. But here our Sobriety muſt ſtand on its Guard, to ſee that we keep to the Rules of Moderati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:040813_0006_10168C76D8F06E10"/>
and be not drawn to Exceſs by the Humour of the Company, or the Pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Liquor.</p>
            <p>Our bountiful Creator has provided many Sorts of Wines, and other generous Liquors, for the Entertainment of Men, to be Cordials to us under the Indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of our frail Bodies, and an Antidote to the over-heavy Afflictions which may befal us, <hi>Pſal.</hi> civ.15. <hi>Prov.</hi> xxxi.6. In theſe Caſes, Wine, and ſuch like ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituous Liquors, are of excellent uſe to the Conveniency of Human Life. And a Chriſtian is in this Reſpect more kindly dealt with than the <hi>Rechabite</hi> or <hi>Maho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metan.</hi> But here's the Miſery: What God has bountifully given us for good Ends, ſenſual Men abuſe to baſe and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious Purpoſes. VVhat God gives us for Chearfulneſs, Men abuſe to Drunken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Exceſs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and then our Cordial is turned into Poiſon, and our VVine into the Gall of Aſps: For where Drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enneſs prevails, all Virtue muſt needs decay, and all Vice is in a VVay to thrive.</p>
            <p>It is through the Preaches which this Sin hath made, that a great Part of that Flood of Sin, which all ſober People
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:040813_0007_10168C798B9A90D8"/>
complain of, has broken in upon us, And till this Vice ceaſes to be modiſh and common, yea till it be duly expoſed and ſuppreſſed, by the juſt Execution of the Laws made for that Purpoſe, all other Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedients of a Reformation of Manners will very much fail of their Deſign. And ſince ſuch a Reformation would be the greateſt Bleſſing that can come upon us, it will behove all wiſe and virtuous Perſons to bring ſuch Offenders to the Correction of the Magiſtrate, as will not otherwiſe be reclaimed.</p>
            <p>This Vice does a Perſon ſo much Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage, both as a Man and as a Chriſtian, that where there is any degree of Senſe, Reaſon, or Conſcience left, it muſt needs make ſome Impreſſion upon him, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Miſchiefs which attend it.</p>
            <p>But becauſe all Motives and Endeavours to repreſs this, or any other Vice, will be in vain, without the Efficacy of the Spirit of Holineſs, I beſeech the God of all Grace to accompany the following Conſiderations with his holy Spirit, that we may become mighty thro' his Grace, to ſilence the Excuſes, and mortify the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations of Men to this Vice, and to raiſe in all that Read them, a moſt vehement
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:040813_0008_10168C7D4A1BB908"/>
and laſting Indignation againſt it. In or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to which I ſhall in the <hi>firſt</hi> Place, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the Miſchiefs it does us as Men, and in the <hi>ſecond</hi> Place, the miſchiefs it does us as Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It injures us as we are Men, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving us of the Uſe of Reaſon, which is the Excellency and the very Diſtinction of Men from Brutes. The wiſeſt Perſon un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Diſorder of Drink becomes a Fool, and commits a thouſand Vanities and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcretions. The Drunkard has not the Speech, the Carriage, nor the Civility of a Man; but is wild, diſorderly, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant.</p>
            <p>Man, as he is rational and wiſe, bears the Image of God; but Intemperance blots out that divine Reſemblance; in ſo much that the moſt deſpicable Creature, even a Dog, a Toad, a Serpent, bear more of the Image of God, than a drunken Man or Woman. For theſe Creatures, tho' mean, are what God made them; but a Perſon overcome with Drink, is altogether un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like to, and more contemptible than even the meaneſt Creature of God's making. He has turned <hi>his Glory into the ſimilitude of the Ox that eareth Graſs,</hi> or rather of the <hi>Swine that wallows in the Mire.</hi> It is
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:040813_0009_10168C7ED712C4D0"/>
uſually ſaid of a Perſon in Drink that <hi>he is not himſelf</hi>; and it is true, for he does not act by the humane Principles of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon or Conſcience; but rather by the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did Appetites of a ſhameles Beaſt, or the raving Fury of one that's poſſeſt by the Devil: So that he's no longer fit for hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Converſation, but is a meer Nuſance and Diſturbance to all that are about him; the Grief of ſome, and the Laughter of others. And the beſt that can be done for him is, to lay him ſomewhere out of the way, till Time and Sleep have reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered his loſt Senſes. And then ſurely, when his Underſtanding returns to him, (as to <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>) it will be as an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to his Breaſt, to think what a Beaſt he has been, and how many ſhameful Pranks he has play'd.</p>
            <p>And it is not only for the preſent that this Vice diſorders the Underſtanding, but the Cuſtom and Habit of it many times utterly beſots Men, and makes them Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren in Underſtanding even to their Death. Where Senſuality is accuſtomed to domineer over Reaſon, it will at laſt eſtabliſh its Authority, and the Beaſt will exerciſe Dominion over the Man: Which leads us to a <hi>ſecond</hi> Conſideration.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:040813_0010_10168C818FCC6348"/>II. This Vice makes People vile and contemptible in the Sight of all Men: Even their Servants and Inferiors deride and contemn them, and the very Boys in the Streets make their Sports with them. Their ridiculous Behaviour moves the Laughter of vain People; whilſt others, who conſider the Matter better, cannot but mourn over the poor beſotted Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and are aſhamed that he ſhould be thought their Friend, or their Acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance. And indeed what Sight can be ſadder, than to ſee one, that is made capable of Communion with God, render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unfit for Society with Men; and to ſee a Man ſelling the Honour and Dignity of his Nature, and his hopes of eternal Bliſs, for the Pleaſure of a little Liquor, whilſt it is running over his Tongue. By this many Perſons of Character and Diſtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on do make themſelves vile and mean, and they loſe the Reſpect which would otherwiſe be due unto them.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The Vice of Intemperance enflames Men's beaſtial Luſts and Paſſions, and lays their Reaſon aſleep, which ought to guard them. And then there will be much the ſame Diſorder, as when wild Beasts have ſlain their Keeper, and are got looſe.
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:040813_0011_10168C831A3E8180"/>
For indeed the Caſe is much the ſame, where unmortified Luſts and Paſſions are heightened by ſtrong Liquors, and no Reaſon nor Conſcience is left to curb and controll them. Hence comes Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and Shameleſſneſs in the moſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeemly Sins; like fed Horſes, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim the Impurity of their Hearts, and the Fury of their Luſts, in the very Streets, as well as when they <hi>aſſemble by Troops in the Houſes of Harlots,</hi> (Jer. v. 7.) Even ſo good a Man as <hi>Lot,</hi> when overcome with Wine, had utterly loſt all Regard to Decency and Honour; and in this Diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, even <hi>Noah</hi> himſelf behaved unſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. It expoſes Perſons to cauſleſs Broils and Quarrels. Many People fall out in their Cups, they know not why nor how; inſomuch that the wiſe Man would have it taken notice of as a Thing common to a Proverb, that he who ſits long, till <hi>Wine inflame him</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions, is like to <hi>have Wounds without Cauſe,</hi> (Prov. xxiii.20.) When the Spirits of men are fired by immoderate Drinking, they ſoon blaze out into a Paſſion at the leaſt Affront, tho' but an imaginary one; and then the Blood of the Party is often
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:040813_0012_10168C8839680F68"/>
ſhed to quench it. How many Murthers have been committed at Taverns, within a few Years? And how great will the Cry be for Vengeance, where two ſuch Sins as Drunkenneſs and Murther call at once to Heaven for Juſtice? How often have Men killed their neareſt Relations or deareſt Friends in their Drink, for which they have been ready to kill themſelves when they came to reflect upon it in their ſober Thoughts? It was in ſuch a De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch as this that <hi>Alexander</hi> killed <hi>Clitus,</hi> one of the deareſt and faithfulleſt Friends he had; and that for doing one of the kindeſt Officeſ of Friendſhip, that is, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving.</p>
            <p n="5">V. In the next Place, it creates divers kinds of <hi>Diſeaſes,</hi> and makes this preſent Life both ſhort and painful. For exceſſive Drinking brings Surfeits,—Fevers,—Drop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies,—Palſies,—an aching Head,—an ill Stomach, and what not? Some indeed, that are of a ſtrong Conſtitution, may bear up longer than others under the Diſorder it brings to their Bodies; but to all it is Poiſon, tho' it works more ſlowly upon ſome than others; and it fails not in the End to bring down their Heads with <hi>Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row to the Grave.</hi>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:040813_0013_10168C8AE221C330"/>It has long been obſerved, and it is, alas! too manifeſt, that if the Sword has ſlain its Thouſands, Intemprance has ſlain its Ten Thouſands: And in many of thoſe who make a ſhift to outlive the common Practice of it, we ſee ſuch mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt Decays of their Strength, Vigour, Wit, and Senſe, that God ſeems to hang them up alive in Chains, to affright others from ſuch ill Courſes. The good God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwade all that are concerned to take War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning thereby.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. A Perſon in the Diſorder of Drink is unable to ſhun the moſt apparent Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. His Eyes are bemiſted, that he can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcern the Danger of a Pit or Preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pice that lies before him, nor know his Friend from his Enemy. How many have fallen from their Horſes, or tumbled into Pits, or fallen into Ponds, or been burnt in their Beds, in a Fit of Intempe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance? Yea, their own Weakneſs ſeems to threaten their Life; they reel and ſtag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger like an Infant; they ſtumble at every Stone that lies in their Way, and are ready to fall to their Ruin. And if by theſe, or any ſuch Accidents, they come by their Death, in what a woful Condition muſt they appear before God, having
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:040813_0014_10168C8C6F30EEC0"/>
died in the very Act of abuſing His Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, and tranſgreſſing His Will?</p>
            <p n="7">VII. It begets in them a Contempt of Sobriety and ſober Perſons. The Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt complains that he was the <hi>Song of the Drunkards,</hi> (Pſal. lxix.12.) When <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bal</hi> was in his Wine, he railed upon <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> the Anointed of God, as if he were a Run-away from his Maſter, (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> xxv.10.)</p>
            <p>I might add, that it cauſes People to be impoſed upon in their Dealings, and renders them a Prey to every deſigning Cheat. It makes them unfit for any Truſt, and for any publick Office in Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil or War. It alſo blaſts their Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and Eſteem in the World; for there's ſcarce any Name more infamous than that of a Sot, or a common Drunkard.</p>
            <p>And after all, 'tis a very waſteful Vice; it is never maintained but by unneceſſary Expence, great Waſte of Time, and Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect of Buſineſs. How many ſtarve the Backs and Bellies of their Families, to maintain this expenſive Vice? Inſomuch that <hi>Solomon</hi> makes it a Proverb, that the <hi>Drunkard and the Glutton ſhall come to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verty,</hi> (Prov. xxiii.21.)</p>
            <p>Thus we ſee ſome of the Miſchiefs of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:040813_0015_10168C8F06E59830"/>
this Vice to us as Men: But alas! The one Half of its Damages is not yet caſt up; for if we look on this Sin, with the enlightened Eyes of a Chriſtian, we ſhall ſee far greater Miſchiefs done by it. For,</p>
            <p n="1">1. It drives away the Holy Spirit of God. This is taught us by the Apoſtle in the Scripture before mentioned, <hi>Eph.</hi> v.18. <hi>Be not drunk with Wine, wherein is Exceſs; but be filled with the Spirit.</hi> Where the dis-junctive Particle [<hi>but</hi>] ſhews us, that we cannot enjoy both together. Our Exceſs will drive away our Sanctifier and Comforter. He is too delicate to dwell with the naſty ſpewing Drunkard. <hi>For what Communion hath Light with Darkneſs? or Chriſt with Belial?</hi> 2 Cor. vi.15. Sure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, if any deſerve the Name of Sons of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lial,</hi> (that is, Men without Yoke, Reſtraint, or Government) theſe are the Perſons; for they are the moſt rude and ungovern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able of all others. And beſides,</p>
            <p n="2">2. This Vice unfits us for every ſpiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and religious Action. The poor beſot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Wretch cannot ſo much as think one ſober Thought, or receive any Good by the pious Advice of others. What Order can there be in that Family, where the Maſter of it is Drunk? Is ſuch a one fit to <pb n="17" facs="unknown:040813_0016_10168C91F8130E88"/>
pray with his Family, or to inſtruct them in the Duties of Religion! May he not tremble to touch any holy Thing in ſuch a polluted Condition? Has he not reaſon to dread the Vengeance of a Holy God upon ſuch a diſorderly Aproach to Him? <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu,</hi> the Prieſts, the Sons of <hi>Aaron,</hi> are ſuppoſed to have drank too much when they offered <hi>ſtrange Fire</hi> before the Lord; becauſe it is imediately added, <hi>Lev.</hi> x.9, 10. That neither <hi>Aaron, nor his Sons, ſhould drink any Wine nor ſtrong Drink, when they went into the Tabernacle, leſt they die for it.</hi> It was always held as an Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to carry Swine's Fleſh into the Temple; which ſeems to teach us, that all Perſons of impure and ungoverned Appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites, are utterly unfit for Communion with the Holy God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. This Vice does very ſadly waſte the Conſcience. It is of a dulling, beſotting Nature: It drowns all ſerious Thought and Reflection, where it grows to a Habit. How many have gone out at this Door into all Exorbitancies and Debauchery? It often betrays Men to profane Swearing Lying, Paſſions, filthy Language and Acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and to any III. He is (as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays) like <hi>one that lieth on the Top of a Maſt,</hi>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:040813_0017_10168C95B4600908"/>
in which Caſe he cannot ſtir, without en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering his Life, <hi>Prov.</hi> xxiii.34<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſo a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon that is Drunk, will be like to do every thing amiſs that he ſets himſelf to, and to be overcome by every Temptation that lies in his VVay.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Intemperance pulls down dreadful Wrath upon the Perſon that is guilty of it, in this Life, and that to come. The Book of God is ſo full of Woes againſt it, that they appear like a Multitude of Spears ſet in array againſt the Perſon that treads in this forbidden Path. <hi>Wo to the Crown of Pride, the Drunkards of Ephraim,</hi> Iſa. xxviii.1. <hi>Wo unto them that riſe up early in the Morning that they may follow ſtrong Drink, that continue until Night, till Wine inflame them,</hi> Iſa. v.11. <hi>Wo unto him that giveth his Neighbour Drink, that putteſt thy Bottle to him, and makeſt him drunken alſo, that thou mayſt ſee his Naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Thou art filled with Shame for Glory; the Cup of the Lord's right Hand ſhall be tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned unto thee, and ſhameful Spewing ſhall be on thy Glory,</hi> Hab. ii.15. <hi>No Drunkard ſhall inherit the Kingdom of God,</hi> 1 Cor. vi.10. Surely, where there is not perfect Infidelity, theſe Terrors of the Lord will in ſome meaſure over-awe Men. For it is
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:040813_0018_10168C97441D7780"/>
very diſmal to conſider thro' what crooked and uneaſy Paths they paſs on to the Place of Everlaſting Torment; where their Mouths will probably be parched with greater Heat than others, in Proportion to their former Exceſſes, and they will for ever want a Drop of cold VVater to cool their Tongues. And then, it will be but little Comfort to think of the Bottles and Barrels that they have drank in waſte in their former Life; yea, that very Thought will for ever give Fuel to their Flames.</p>
            <p>Let thoſe that are ſtrong to drink VVine, or ſtrong Drink, conſider this; and ſuch as entice or compel others to drink more than is fit. It is ſo natural to leave every one to his Liberty in this Point, that a Heathen Emperor provided for it by the Law, <hi>Eſth.</hi> i.8. <hi>The Drinking</hi> (at a moſt generous Entertainment) <hi>was accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Law; none did compel.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe Things being conſidered, we e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven beſeech Men, by all that is dear to them in both VVorlds, to diſdain a baſe Vice, which adds ſo much to their preſent Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and Damage, and to their eternal Torment and Confuſion.</p>
            <p>VVe perſwade you by the Love ye bear yourſelves, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> as ye deſire the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:040813_0019_10166531B0D9D818"/>
Continuance of your preſent Life and Health; as you regard the Honour of Human Nature, or tender your Reputati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that you abhor a Vice, which deſtroys all theſe Enjoyments.</p>
            <p>Yea, we entreat you by that which ought to be dearer to you than your Lives, even by the Love and Fear of the great and good God, as you value his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and would not fall under his ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting Vengeance, that you would inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcard this deſtructive Vice, and that you would <hi>watch</hi> and be <hi>ſober.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Come out of the ſenſeleſs Amuſements of this beſotting Sin, <hi>my Brother</hi>; ſhun the Company, the Drink, and the Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion which leads you into this Snare, and thereby into the bottomleſs Pit. Look up to Heaven, I beſeech you, before it be utterly loſt; frequent the Company of good and ſober People, and entreat them to watch over you, and to admoniſh you in the Lord; and above all, beg the graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Conduct of God's Holy Spirit, by ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt and continual Prayer; and be ſure to frequent all God's holy Ordinances, and to improve all good Motions put into your Heart from above. And think often upon the Miſchiefs of this Sin in both VVorlds,
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:040813_0020_10168C9F15578810"/>
with an awakened Expectation of a Judg<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ment to come.</p>
            <p>But if our moſt affectionate Perſwaſives take no Place upon you, we muſt then, in pure Affection to you, try the Power of other Reſtraints; as we deal with our beſt Friends, when they are bereaved of the Use of their Reaſon. And we cannot but entreat all ſober Perſons, as they would do you Good, or do Honour to God, that they would put you to Shame before the Magiſtrate, to reſtrain you from deſtroying yourſelf, and pulling down Calamities and Judgments upon the Publick. If you ſaw a Perſon in a furious or drunken Fit, caſting Fire-brands upon all the Houſes he came near, you would think all thoſe People worthy of great Blame that did not lay hold on him, and bring him to Justice. And in very Truth, every ſcandalous Tranſgreſſor does greater Miſchief to his Neighbour; for by Reaſon of theſe Things, where they abound without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troll, the righteous Judgments of God come upon a Land, 'till it be made a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and a Deſolation.</p>
            <p>Upon the Whole: If no Entreaty nor Affliction upon Earth will reclaim this exceſſive Lover of his Drink, a very
<pb n="22"
                   facs="unknown:040813_0021_10168CA0A0A45E78"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
ſhort Time will convince him of the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonableneſs and ſad Conſequence of ſo doing; even when he ſhall receive a Summons by ſome Diſeaſe, or ſome ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Accident, (perhaps of his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing) to appear before his great and terrible Judge: Then will a Cup of Trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling be put into his Hands, as in the Caſe of <hi>Belſhazzer,</hi> and he muſt drink of the Cup of God's VVrath for ever. Then will the moſt beſotted VVretch begin to think ſoberly both of Vice and Virtue; and cry out of the Folly of pleaſing himſelf in that ſottiſh VVay of Life, which firſt robbed him of his Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, then of his Conſcience, then of his God, and then of his Heaven.</p>
            <p>
