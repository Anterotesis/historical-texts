            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>The occasion of my undertaking what is here presen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, was a letter which I received from a worthy person, who upon the perusal of that <hi>brief historical Account</hi> of the war with the Indians in <hi>New England,</hi> published the last summer, importuned me to write the story of the <hi>Pequot War;</hi> Taking his motion into consideration, it came into my thoughts, that it would be a service and benefit for po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sterity, if all other general troubles which have happened by the <hi>Heathen</hi>in this land, were recorded and made known; &amp; the rather, in tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> as to those <hi>first motions and commotions</hi> there are very few that know any thing of them.

                  <p>Such Books as I had by me, that relate any thing of these affaires I have been willing to revolve. e.g. <hi>Johannes de Laet</hi> his <hi>Description of America,</hi> written in Latin; Also several of Cpt. <hi>Smith</hi> his books; And <hi>a relation of the discovery of New England,</hi> published by the President and Council of <hi>New England.</hi> Ann<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

troubles which have happened by the Indians in New England, whose pains and industry doth (in my judgment) deserve acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgment.

The Indians returned at the time appointed with twenty <hi>Canoos,</hi> but were shy of coming aboard. <hi>Epenow</hi> cunningly called to them as if if he would have them come into the vessel, to trade, and suddenly did himself leap overboard: He was no sooner in the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, but me Indians sent a shower of arrows into the vessel, and came des<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately near to the ship, and (in despight of all the English Musketiers aboard) went away with their Country-man <hi>Epenow.</hi>

But their Shallop not being in trimm to be sent out upon discovery, some were desirous to improve the time, in making what searches they could upon the land thereabout.</p>
                  <p>Novemb. 5.

                  <p>At last they met with a kettle, wherein was Indian corn, which after much consultation they seized upon, resolving that if they could come to speak with Indians, they would return them their Kettel, and give them full satisfaction for their corn, which they intended for planting, not knowing how else to be supplyed. So did they return the next day, but lost themselves awhile in the woods, and as they were wandring up &amp; down, they hap<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>After this, their Shallop being fitted for the purpose, they went a coast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

upon discovery, but of some dayes could meet with no Indians. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit they found old deserted Indian Forts, and more of their corn and baskets, and a bottle of oyle which doubtless some how was brought out of <hi>Europe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>About the tenth of December, they discerned the track of Indian feet upon the sand, and followed it, till they perceived where it struck up in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the woods, at last they light upon an Indian path, which led them a great way up into the woods, and saw where there had been corn planted, and found Indian gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Now it was that a special providence of another nature hapned: For the English having built an house in <hi> Plimouth,</hi> a spark of fire flying into the thatch, it was instantly burnt down: Mr. <hi>Carver</hi> and Mr. <hi>Bradford</hi> were then sick, yet if they had not risen with good speed, they had been blown up with powder.

                  <p>Febr. 16. An English-man that was gone forth upon a fowling design, espyed twelve Indians marching toward the English plantation, and heard the noise of many more not far off, he lay close untill they were gone by, and then with all speed returned home and gave the alarm, but no Indians followed, only they took away the tools of those English, that had been at work in the woods.</p>
                  <p>The next day two Indians presented themselves on the top of an hill; two English went out to parly with them, but they ran away, and the noise of a multitude of them was heard on the other side of the hill.</p>

Accordingly, March 22. <hi>Massasoit</hi> with his brother <hi>Quadeguina</hi> came accompanied with about sixty of his men; and an agreement of peace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the English and Indians was then concluded on.

At that time also there was enmity between <hi>Massasoit,</hi> and the <hi>Narragansets,</hi> so that he hoped the English might be a defence to him against them. Thus did the feud which was kindled amongst the Indians one against another, advantage the poor Church in Plymouth. <hi>Sic Canes lingunt ulcera Lazari.</hi> Moreover the consideration of the Guns, and other warlike Weapons, which ours brought with them, was terrible to the Indians, yet they had more formidable apprehensions thereof, then there was real cause for: They imagined that the English could by their great Guns cause the trees to fall down and kill the Indians.

                  <p>Others of them were of such servile and slavish dispositions, as that they became servants to the Indians, who would hire them to work with them in making Canoos, which Canoos were intended for the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prizal of the English ship, in the day when they would execute their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Some of the Theeves were stockt and whipt, yea one of them was at last put to death, to satisfie the Indians, but it was then too late.</p>
                  <p>By the end of <hi>February,</hi> they had spent all their bread and corn, not leaving any for seed, nor would the Indians be induced to lend or sel them any, upon any terms, hoping they would be starved to death.</p>
                  <p>Wherefore, they purposed to take away the Indians store from them by violence, and therefore made preparations accordingly. Only some of the Company (at leastwise one of them who is yet alive) being more honestly minded then others were, advised <hi>John Saunders</hi> their Over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seer, to write to <hi>Plymouth</hi> before they did actually attempt anything, which being done, they received letters from the Governour there, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifying great disapprobation of their intended proceedings, whereupon they desisted.</p>
                  <p>These motions must needs cause ill blood between the Nations: so that the Indians grew very insolent in their carriage, and there were se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret conspiracyes to cut off the English.

and how he had been the death of Christians both French and English and what pittifull weak Creatures they were, that when they were kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, they died crying, and made sower faces, more like children then men, and that whereas they were determined to kil the English (who had injured them) of Mr. <hi>Westons</hi> plantation, the best way for their own security was, to kill them of <hi>Plymouth</hi> too, now their Captain being in their hands, having but six men with him, two or three in the <hi>Wigwam,</hi> and no more in the shallop, it was a good opportunity to begin.</p>

                  <p>There is an old <hi>Planter</hi> yet living in this countrey, being one of those that were employed by Mr. <hi>Weston,</hi> who also hath given some account of these matters.</p>
                  <p>He doth relate, and affirm, that at his first coming into this coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, the English were in a very distressed condition, by reason of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and sickness which was amongst them, whereof many were alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy dead; and that they buried them in the night, that the Indians might not perceive how low they were brought.</p>

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000238_0023_0FA36E0B13A9E3C8"/>
Indians parted them from one another, that they made them eat such meat as they gave their dogs. Only one of them having a good Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, he provided a Wife for him, by whom he had a Son, and lived longer then the rest of the French men did; and that one of them was wont to read much in a Book (some say it was the New-Testament) and that the Indians enquiring of him what his Book said, he told them it did intimate, that there was a people like French men that would come into the Country, and drive out the Indians, and that they were now afraid that the English were the people of whole coming the French man had foretold them. And that another ship from <hi>France</hi> came into the <hi>Massachusets Bay</hi> with Goods to Truck, and that Indian <hi>Panies</hi> propounded to the Sachim, that if he would hearken to him, they would obtain all the French mens Goods for nothing, namely, by coming a multitude of them aboard the vessel, with great store of Bea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, making as if they would Truck, &amp; that they should come without Bows and arrows, only should have knives hid in the flappets which the Indians wear about their loins, and when he should give the <hi>Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>word,</hi> they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> should run their knives into the French mens bellyes, which was accordingly executed by the Indians, and all the French men kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, only Mounsier <hi>

                  <p>Some enquiring of him how long it was since the Indians first saw a ship, he replyed that he could not tel, but some old Indians reported, that the first ship seemed to them to be a Floating Island, wrapped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the roots of trees, and broken off from the Land, which with their <hi>Canoos</hi> they went to see, but when they found men there and heard gunns, they hasted to the shore again not a little amazed.

great gravity saying, <q>When you first came into this land, I was your friend, we gave gifts to-one another. I set you have land as much as we agreed for, and now I would know of you if I or my men have done you any wrong.</q> Unto whom the English replyed, that they desired, that he would first declare whether they had injured him.</p>
                  <p>The Sachim roundly<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> rejoyned, that either some or all of them had been abusive to him; for they had stolen away his corn, and though he had given them notice of it times without number, yet there was no satisfaction nor reformation attained.</p>
                  <p>Hereupon, the English took the principal <hi>Thief</hi> and bound him and delivered him to the <hi>Sachim,</hi> with all declaring, that he might do with him what he pleased. Nay (said he) Sachim<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> do justice themselves upon their own men, and let their neighbours do justice upon theirs, otherwise we conclude that they are all agreed, and then fight.</p>
                  <p>Now the Indians some of them began to tremble, and beholding the Guns which were mounted on the English Fort, they said one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (in their Language) that little guns would shoot through houses, and great guns would break down trees, and make them fall and kill Indians round about. So did they depart at that time dissatisfied and enraged.</p>
                  <p>The English now perceiving that the Indians were fully purposed to be revenged on them, they resolved to fight it out to the last man.</p>
                  <p>As they were marching out of the Fort, seven or eight men stood stil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> saying, this is the second time that the Salvages had demanded the life of him that had wronged them, and therefore they would have him first put to death, and if that would not satisfy, then to fight it out to the last, wherefore he was put to death in the sight of the Heathen; after which the English marched out towards them, but they dispersed themselves into the woods.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>Relator</hi> endeavoured to give notice to them in <hi>Plymouth,</hi> how that the Indians had contrived their ruin, but he missed his way between <hi>Weymouth</hi> and <hi>Plymouth;</hi> and it was wel he did so; for by that means, he escaped the savage hands of those Indians, who immediately pursued him, with a murderous intention Ere he could reach <hi>Plymouth,</hi> they were informed by <hi>Massaso<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>Finally there were (as this <hi>Relator</hi> testifieth) three several skirmishes with the Indians.

were notably beaten, and the English received no considerable damage, so that the Sachims entreated for peace, nor were the English, (provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded it might be upon terms safe and honourable) averse thereunto, <hi>Pacem t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>These dark clouds being thus comfortably dispelled, and blown o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, the <hi>first Planters</hi> in this Country received no considerable distur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance from the Indians a long time.

                  <p>The like is to be affirmed concerning Mr. <hi>Wollas<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I have been informed, that this Gentleman considering the unhappy <hi>Catastrophe's</hi> attending Mr. <hi>Weston</hi> and Mr. <hi>Gorges,</hi> their plantings at <hi>Wesegusquaset,</hi> conceited that the Indian <hi>Powaws</hi> had brought that place under some fascination, and that Englishmen would never thrive upon <hi>Enchanted ground,</hi> and therefore they would pitch down their stakes in a place nearer to <hi>Boston;</hi> even where the town of <hi>Brantree</hi> hath since flourished; but the difficultyes of a Wilderness were<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> too hard for them, that Mr. <hi>Wollaston</hi> removed a great part of his servants to <hi>Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia,</hi> not having (so far as I can understand) received any molestation from the Indians here.</p>
                  <p>In Anno 1628. Mr. <hi>Endecot</hi> (who deserves to be honourably menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned, as having been a <hi>Patriot</hi> in <hi>New-England</hi>) arrived here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

from them, were conspiring to destroy them. And the small handfull of Christians then in <hi>Salem,</hi> were alarmd with the report of no less then a thousand Barbarous Natives, coming to cut them off, and that upon a Lords day, whereupon they discharged several great guns, the small shot<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wherein made such a terrible ratling amongst the trees a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>far off, that the amazed Indians returned not a little affrighted. And it was a wonderfull providence of God, now to restrain the Heathen, since it so hapned that about this time there were some Tumults a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the English themselves. For whereas Mr. <hi>Wollaston.</hi> and his Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners left some of their servants here; and gave order that a man whose name was <hi>Filcher,</hi> should command and oversee them. There was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other whose name was <hi>Thomas Morton,</hi> he would needs take upon him to be <hi>Lord of Mis-rule,</hi> and having gained much by trading with the <hi>Indians,</hi> this <hi>Morton</hi> and his drunken Companions quickly wasted all in riotous living.</p>
                  <p>This was the man that taught the Indians in these parts <hi>the use of Guns,</hi> how they should charge and discharge them, and imployed them in Hunting for him: And when they were instructed in the use of these instruments of death, they would purchase them at any rates, whereby the safety of the English was not a little hazzarded.</p>
                  <p>In conclusion, the English at <hi>Plymouth</hi> and <hi>Salem,</hi> agreed to seyze upon this <hi>Morton,</hi> which was done <hi>Vi &amp; armis,</hi> and he was sent over to <hi>England,</hi> there to receive such punishment as by the honourable Council for <hi>New-England</hi> should be thought meet.</p>
                  <p>All these tumults notwithstanding, the over-ruling providence of God kept the Indians quiet.<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>It is to be wondred at, that the Church in <hi>Plymouth</hi> should be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served when other English Plantations could not subsist in this Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, but either the Indians, or the Lords own hand brought them to a sudden end from time to time.

3. They prevailed with God by Fasting and Prayer to look upon them and bless them with special mercy when it was a time of need, which did greatly affect and astonish the Indians: some of them there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conceiving high thoughts concerning the English mans God, and his love to his people, that truly fear and serve him. That which Mr <hi>Winslow</hi> (and since him another) doth publickly testifie concerning this matter, deserveth Commemoration, namely, that whereas after the <hi>First Indian Troubles</hi> were over, there was a sore drought on the land continuing for the space of six Weeks, insomuch that it was judged by some that the corn was withered and dead, past recovery, the <hi>Church in Plymouth</hi> set themselves by Fasting and Prayer, to seek mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from the Lord in this thing. And although in the morning when they assembled themselves, the heavens were clear, and the drought as likely to continue as ever, yet before their solemn Exercise was ended, the heavens grew black with clouds, and the next morning these clouds distilled rain, and for the space of fourteen dayes together there were moderate showers, so that the drooping corn was revived to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
                  <p>A friendly Indian, before mentioned, known by the name of <hi>Hobbo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mock,</hi> living in the town of Plymouth, enquired why the English met together in that manner, it being but three dayes after the Sabba<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

The Indians not being wont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to such things with their small Canooes, and also being impatient of all delayes, desired they might<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be set on shore, promising they would meet our Army at <hi>Seybrook;</hi> which request of theirs was grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and they being set at liberty hastning to their Quarters at <hi>Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brook,</hi> met with about thirty or fourty of the <hi>Pequots,</hi> near <hi>S<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>Capt. <hi>Underhill</hi> hearing of the approach of the Army, went &amp; met them and informed them what was performed by <hi>Unc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                                    </gap>
                                 </hi> and his men, which news was welcome to them, and looked upon as a special pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence; for before they were somewhat doubtful of the fidelity of their Indian Volunteers.</p>
                              <p>Capt. <hi>Underhill</hi> hearing of the design our Army was upon, very freely offered his Service with nineteen men to go along with them, if Leiut. <hi>Gardner</hi> would allow of it (who was chief Commander at Saybrook Fort) which motion was no sooner propounded to Lieut. <hi>Gardner,</hi> but he readily approved of it, and our Council of War ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted of it also; who in liew of those twenty, immediately sent back
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:000238_0033_0FA36E128932ACE0"/>
twenty of theirs to Connecticut to help guard the women and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren &amp;c.</p>
                              <p>Upon a wednesday our Army arrived at Saybrook, where they say wind-bound till Friday, in which time the Council of War consulted how and in what manner they should proceed in their Enterprize, which was accompanied<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with much difficulty; their Commission order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to land their men in the <hi>Pequit</hi> River, against which were these difficultyes.</p>
                              <p>First. The <hi>Pequods</hi> kept a continual Guard upon the River, night 'and day in a constant course.</p>
                              <p>Secondly. Their numbers far exceeded ours; they had also sixteen gunns with powder and shot, besides their Indian Artilery, as our Councill of War was informed by the two captive maids (mentioned where we declared the Grounds of this War) who were redeemed by the Dutch, and restored now to us at Seybrook, which was a very friendly office, and not to be forgotten.</p>
                              <p>Thirdly. They were on Land, and being swift of foot, might much impede the landing of our men, and dishearten them, they continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally guarding that River, and our men not knowing where to land nearer then <hi>Narraganset.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>Fourthly. It was alledged that if our Army landed at Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganset, they would come upon their Backs, and possibly might sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize them unawares; at worst they should be on firm Land as well as the enemy.</p>
                              <p>Notwithstanding these reasons, the Council of Warr, all of them except the Captain, were at a stand, and could not judg it meet to fail to <hi>Narraganset.</hi> Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> in this difficult case, went to the Reverend Mr. <hi>Samuel Stone,</hi> late Teacher to the Church of Christ at <hi>Hartford,</hi> who was sent as Preacher to the Army, and desired him that he would that night commend their case and difficultyes before the Lord, and seek direction of him in the matter, how and in what manner they should demean themselves. He retired himself from them aboard the Pink the remaining part of that day, and the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing night was not wanting in spreading the case before the Lord, and seeking his direction, in the morning he came on shore to the Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains chamber, and told him he had done as he desired him, (and though formerly he had been against sailing to <hi>Narraganset</hi> and land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, yet now he was fully satisfied to attend it.</p>
                              <p>The Councel being again called, and the matter debated, &amp; rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons considered, they agreed all with one accord to sail to <hi>Narragan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set,</hi>
                                 <pb n="29" facs="unknown:000238_0034_0FA36E1347DE6B68"/>
which the next morning they put in execution, which proved very succesfull, as the sequel may evidently demonstrate. What shall I say? God led his people through manifold Difficultyes and Turnings, yet by more then an ordinary hand of Providence, <hi>He led them in a right way.</hi>
                              </p>
                              <p>On Friday morning, they in pursuance of their design set sail for <hi>Narraganset Bay,</hi> and on Saturday toward evening they arrived at their desired Port, where they kept the Sabbath.</p>
                              <p>On Munday the wind blew so hard at Norwest that they could not go on shoar, as also on Tuesday till it was near Sunset, but the wind abating, they and their design being commended to God by Mr. <hi>Stone,</hi> Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> and his Company landed, and marched up to the place of the chief Sachims residence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and told him, that they had not an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity before, to acquaint him with their coming armed into his countrey, yet they hoped it would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                                 </gap> accepted by him, there being amity between us and them, and also that the <hi>Pequots</hi> and they were enemies, and that he could not be unacquainted with those intolerable wrongs and injuries, those <hi>Pequots</hi> had lately done unto the English<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that they were now come (God assisting) to avenge ourselves upon them, and that they did only desire free passage through his country.</p>
                              <p>The <hi>Sachim</hi> returned this Answer, that he did accept of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and did also approve of their designe, only he thought our numbers were too weak to deal with the enemy, who were(as he said) very great Captains, and men skilful in war, thus he spake somewhat slightingly of our men.</p>
                              <p>On Wednesday morning they marched from thence, to a place called <hi>Niantick,</hi> it being about eighteen, or twenty miles, distant, where another of those <hi>Narraganset</hi> Sachims lived in a Fort, it being a frontier to the <hi>Pequots.</hi> They carried it very proudly to our men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> not permitting any of them to come into their fort.</p>
                              <p>Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> beholding their carriage, and knowing the falshood of the Indians, fearing left they might discover them to the enemy, es<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially the Indians having many times some of their neer relations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongst their greatest Foes, saw cause to set a guard about their fort that no Indian might oass in or out, and charged the Indians not to pass out upon the peril of their lives. And there they Quartered that night, the Indians not offering to stir out all the while.</p>
                              <p>In the morning came to the Army several of <hi>Miantinomie</hi> his men<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who told them they were come to assist them in the expedition, which encouraged diverse Indians of that place to engage also, who drawing

Thus were they now at their wits end, who not many houres before exalted themselves in their great pride, threatning and resolving the utter ruin and destruction of all the English, exulting and rejoicing with songs and dances; but God was above them, who laughed his enemyes and the enemyes of his people to scorn, making them as a fiery oven; thus were the stout hearted spoiled, having slept their last sleep, and none of their men could find their hands; thus did the Lord judge among the heathen, filling the place with dead bodyes.</p>
                              <p>And here we may take notice of Gods judgement upon this bloody Generation, in sending the very night before the assault an hundred and fifty men from their other fort to join with this fort, who were design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing (as some of themselves have related) to go forth against the English at that very instant when this stroke came upon them, where the most of them perished with their fellows, so that the mischief they inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded against us came upon themselves; they were taken in their own s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And thus in little more then one houres space was their Impregnable <hi>fort,</hi> with themselves utterly destroyed, to the number of <hi>five or six hundred,</hi> as hath been confessed by the <hi>Pequots</hi> who escaped. There were seven taken captive, and about <hi>eight</hi> escaped; and <hi>of the English</hi> there were <hi>two slain</hi> outright, and above <hi>twenty wounded.</hi> Some of our soldiers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The Chyrurgion was much wanted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who was left with the Barks in Narraganset Bay, with order there to remain until the night before they intended the assault.</p>
                              <p>And thereupon grew many difficultyes amongst the Army, their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision and ammunition being neer spent, and they in the enemyes coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trey, who did far exceed them in numbers, being much enraged, and most of our Indian friends having left them, and our pinnaces at a great distance from them, and their coming uncertain.</p>
                              <p>But as they were consulting what course to take, it pleased God to discover our vessels to them under a fair Gale of wind failing into the <hi>Pequot</hi> Harbour, to their great rejoicing.</p>
                              <p>They had no sooner discovered our vessels, but immediately came up the enemy from the other fort about three hundred of them. Capt. <hi>Mason</hi> led forth a file or two of men to skirmish with them, which stopt their Carrier, and put them to a stand, and then they prepared to march towards our vessels, but four or five of our men were so wounded that they were fain to be carried, with the Armes of about twenty more which took up so many of the souldiers, that there was not above forty

men free, but at length they hired several Indians to carry the woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men, who cased them of that burthen, and carried their woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded men for them.</p>
                              <p>And when the souldiers had marched about a quarter of a mile, the enemy came to the place where the fort had stood, and when they beheld the ruines thereof, and the carcases of their friends lye some upon the earth, others scorched, and some almost consumed, with the fire, they stamped and tore the hair from their heads, and ran mouting down the hill in their full Carreer, and the loss they met withal made them wary not to come near.</p>
                              <p>The souldiers then meeting with a small brook at the foot of the hil being very dry, sat down and refreshed themselves, the enemy being grown by this time so wary they durst not come too neer, to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sturb them.</p>
                              <p>Then they marched on towards <hi>Pequot</hi> Harbour, and meeting with<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>several <hi>Wigwams</hi> in the way they burnt them; the enemy followed them, and some lay in ambush behind rocks and trees, often shooting at them, yet God so covered them, that not one of them was hurt, and when they came to any swamp or thicket, they made some shot, and cleared a passage, and some of the enemy fell, which our Indians see<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, would give a great shout, and then venture to fetch their heads, and thus they continued, till they came within two miles of Pequot Harbour, where the enemy gathered themselves together, and left our army, they marched on to the top of an hill adjoining to the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, with their colours flying, (as for their Drum, it was lost, or at least left by their Drummer at the place where they kept their ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dezvouze the night before) where they saw our vessels riding at An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chor to their great rejoicing, and when they had marched to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter side, there they sat down in quiet.</p>

                              <p>Then they drew up their Bark into a Creek the better to defend her, there being some hundreds of Indians within five miles, waiting their motions.</p>

                              <p>They then called to them, saying, they desired to speak with them, and that they would lay down their armes for that end, whereupon they stood up: The Captain told them that the <hi>Pequots</hi> had violated their promise and Covenant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with the English, in that they were not there to inhabit, and that he was sent to supplant them; The Indians answered, the <hi>Pequots</hi> were good men, their friends, and they would fight for them and protect them; which words moved the Captain, who told them it was not far to the head of the creek<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where he would meet them, and then they might try what they could do;
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:000238_0046_0FA36E1C47D50528"/>
The Indians replyed, <hi>they would not fight with 'Englishmen, for they were spirits;</hi> but they would fight with <hi>Uncas.</hi> The Captain told them he thought it was too early for them to fight; but they might take their opportunity and fight when they saw cause, for they should be burning their Wigwams, and carrying their corn aboard all that day, and presently caused the Drum to be beat up, and fired their Wigwams in their view<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> But as they<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> marched along, there stood two Indians upon an hill jeering &amp; reviling of them; Mr. <hi>Sta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                              <p>They then proceeded and loaded their Bark with Indian Corn, and their Cannoes, about thirty of them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with <hi>Indian Trayes, Kettles, Mats,</hi> and other luggage, and then went on board, and made homeward, and it pleased God to prosper them, so that in a short time they all arrived in safety at the place of their abode; Though they were in hazard by the vessels striking upon a rock, and sticking thereon a while in their return, yet the Lord bore them in his own armes, and preserved them from danger.</p>
                              <p>Thus we may see how the face of God is set against them that do e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, to cut off their remembrance from the earth.</p>
                              <p>Our tongues therefore shall talk of his righteousness all the day long, for they are confounded, they are brought to shame that sought our hurt. <hi>Blessed be the Lord God of Israel, who only doth won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drous things,&amp; blessed be his holy name forever, Let the whole earth be fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led with his glory;</hi> for the Lord was pleased to smite our enemyes in the hinder parts, and to give us their land for an inheritance, who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membred us in our low estate, and redeemed us out of our enemies hands; Let us therefore praise the Lord for his goodness and his won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works to the Children of men.</p>

                              <p>Those who were employed in this service were not many, their Commons were very short, there being then a general scarcity through out this Colony of all sorts of provision, it being upon our very be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginnings

on the place, they had but little refreshment with them in their long march from <hi>Narraganset to Pequot;</hi> but one pint of liquor which was moderately dealt out to such as fainted in the way, by reason of the extremity of the heat and sore travel: after the liquor was spent, the very smelling to the bottle was effectual for the revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving of the fainting souldiers. They walked in an unknown path, yet God guided them <hi>in the way they should got,</hi> though they knew not where the <hi>Forts</hi> were, nor how far it was to them, nor the way that lead to them otherwise then what they had from their Indian Guides, in whom they durst not confide, and that in their so long a march a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong a treacherous people, who had several relations amongst our enemies, and that in their march, and allodgment in the enemies coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, which was very populous, they should not be discovered, but brought to their enemies in the fittest season, when more of them then usually were together, and that they should be so succeeded in their design, (as you have heard) is matter of wonderment.</p>
                              <p>What shall I say? God was pleased to hide them in the hollow of his hand.

                              <p>It may not be amiss here also to remember Mr. <hi>Stone</hi> (the famous Teacher of the Church of <hi>Hartford</hi>) who was sent to preach &amp; pray with those that went out in these engagements against the <hi>Pequots;</hi> He lent his best assistance and counsel in the management of those designs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the night in which the engagement was, (in the morning of it) I say that night he was with the Lord alone, wrestling with Him by Faith and Prayer; and surely his Prayers prevailed for a blessing; and in the very time when our Israel were ingaging with the bloud-thirsty <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quots,</hi> he was in the top of the mount, and so held up his hand, that Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael prevailed.</p>
                              <p>In those ingagements some men had special deliverances. There were two men, being one mans servants, who were both shot in the knotts of their neck-cloathes about their necks, and received no hurt. Also Li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

In Anno 1636. A Vessel going from Connecticut towards the Bay, putting in at Block Island, the Indians coming aboard to trade, killed the Master. Another vessel coming from Connecticut, taken with a cross wind, intended to put in at <hi>Narraganset,</hi> but could not; being therefore forced upon <hi>Block-Island,</hi> they saw a bark with her sayls up, driving too and fro, they hailed her, but no Answer was given; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving her full of Indians they suspected the English belonging to the Vessel were murdered, whereupon they discharged their guns, shooting bullets amongst the Indians, who, many of them immediately leaped overboard. The Master entred the Vessel, and lifting up a Cloth saw an Englishman dead, and discerning that many Indians were still in the hold, he returned to his own Vessel again, from thence pouring in small shot upon the Indians, for a while, until the wind coming fair; he failed away to <hi>Boston,</hi> informing the Governour and Council there, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what he had seen, whence about an hundred Souldiers were forth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with sent to <hi>Block-Island.</hi> As they were landing, the Indians came down and shot violently at them, wounding<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> one man, but as soon as one Englishmen was landed, they ran away.

After this the <hi>Pequots</hi> came near the Fort &amp; destroyed many of the English Cattel. About two miles distant from the Fort there was an English house wherein were Souldiers. Their Commander charged them not to go out of doors, yet three of them would venture, and as they were a musket shot from the house, the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians encompassed them, and took two of them alive, the third being wounded did with his naked Sword escape through them to the house, relating to the Company the sad Event, and that one of those English that were taken did first kill two Indians. The next day all the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish deserted that house, and repaired to the Fort. The Indians then quickly burned that, and two other houses. They made towards the Fort as if they would have done some great matter; but a great Gun be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing discharged at them, they went quite away, and were no more seen at <hi>Say-brook</hi> for the greatest part of that winter. Only three miles up the River two men going in a Canoo to shoot Geese, the Indians hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Report of their Guns, came upon them. Those two English sought to save their lives by padling, but the Indians pursued them with another Canoo shot at them and wounded one in his head, who fell overboard, the other shot stoutly at the Indians, but at last being wounded and wearied, the Indians overtook him, he with his paddle cleft one of the Indians heads, but the rest took him, and tortured him to death.</p>
                  <p>Feb. 22. The Lieut. with nine Souldiers well armed, went out of the Fort to burn the woods thereabouts, being gone half a mile from home they were besett with about seventy Indians, who let fly their Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows very fiercely; the English retreated, one man presently was shot in the neck and then did they lay hands on him, he drew his Sword, but that was taken from him; Then would he (as the Indians afterwards testified) have killed himself with his own knife, but that also did the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians deprive him of, and cut off his nose and hands, and put him to a cruel death; They shot down another English man with three

Arrows, and a third had one of his ribs cleft with an Arrow, so that he died immediately. A fourth was mortally wounded, and though he got home alive, he died within fourteen hours, a fifth was sorely woun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, but afterwards recovered, and lived (the next year) to behead that very Indian who had shot an arrow into him. Yea, the Lieut. himself was wounded in this Skirmish. After this the Indians kept Leaguer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Say-brook</hi> Fort.</p>
                  <p>March.9. A body of Indians consisting (as was conjectured) of two or three hundred came within musket shot of the Fort, challenging the English to come out and fight, mocking and upbraiding them with such words as the English used when by them tortured to death, and bragged that they could kill English men <hi>all one flyes:</hi> But two great Gunns loa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den with Carthages of musket bullets being fired at them, away they went, and hearing that the <hi>Narragansets</hi> were invading their country, they visited <hi>Seybrook</hi> no more.</p>
                  <p>After these things, a shallop coming down from Connecticut, with three men rowing, was set upon by several canoes of Indians, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glish sought stoutly so long as they could, but one of them being shot through the nose, so as the arrow went out at the crown of his head, fell overboard and dyed: The other two were taken<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> by the Indians, who ripped them up from the bottom of the belly to the throat, and cleft them down the back throughout, and afterwards <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He whom they took Prisoner, was a perfideous Villain, one that could speak English well, having in times past lived in the fort, and knowing all the English there, had been at the slaughtering of all the English that were slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered thereabouts; He was a continual spy about the fort, informing <hi>Sassacus</hi> of what he saw or could learn.

After that they took a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother Indian Captive, who likewise engaged to lead the English upon the Pequots, but he directed them into a quite contrary way, for which his life was deservedly taken from him. But an Indian called <hi>Luz,</hi> who was before taken Captive by our Souldiers in the Pequot Country, with two other Indians that were his kinsmen, promised if the English would give him, and his kinsmen their lives, He would conduct them to the Enemies they sought after. He did so, the Pequots with other Indians belonging to those parts, were found near a Swamp, into which they did betake themselves for safety, upon the approach of the English Souldiers. After a while, an Indian came out of the Swamp un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>armed, with a present of <hi>Wampam,</hi> The English declared to him that they came not to take away the lives of the Indians nor their goods, if they would deliver up the murtherers that were amongst them. After which ninety nine came forth with their Sachim, who offered as a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent all the Estate he had to dispose of, and that was nothing but the Coat on his back, being a Bears Skin. He was sent into the Swamp again to signify to the Pequots there lurking, that if they would bring forth the murderers it should be better for them, which they would not do, but at last professed they had lived together, and they would dy together</p>
                  <p>There were about seventy or eighty Indians in the Swamp, amongst whom there were twelve murderers. So then the English besett the Swamp; and shot in upon them, and the Indians at them, some of which were furnished with Guns. One in special that was climbing up a Tree to shoot at the English, was espyed by a Souldier, who sent a Bullet into him before the other could make his shot. In the night time the Indians brake away. Diligent search was the next day made in the Swamp for dead Indians, Not many, (as some have made Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration) but seven, and no more could be found. As for the Captives a

Guard was appointed to look after them, they were charged upon pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ril of their lives not to attempt running away; yet one of them betook himself to his heels, but a Souldier shot after him, and killed him, which struck a Terror into the rest of the Captives, that no man durst make an offer to escape.

                  <p>On May 8. A Dutch Sloop came by <hi>Saybrook</hi> Fort, having on Board an Indian Captive, who said she was <hi>Momonottocks</hi> Squaw. The Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish there desired the Dutch-men to let them have the Squaw in order to redeeming the English Captives, offering to give them to the value of two hundred pound, provided that those Captives might be set at li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty.

In Conclusion Capt. <hi>Underhil</hi> (who then commanded the Fort) having obteined the Consent of the Master of the Vessel, did <hi>Vi &amp; armis</hi> take the Squaw out of the Sloop. Afterwards when the <hi>Moheags</hi> came to <hi>Saybrook</hi> that Squaw appeared to be one belonging to them, whom the <hi>Pequots</hi> had Captivated, and she made the Dutch believe she was <hi>Momonottocks Squaw,</hi> hoping that thereby she should obtein the more courteous usage amongst those into whose hands she was fallen, so that the contest between the English and Dutch about her was needless. In the <hi>Interim</hi> the Dutch Governour sent another Sloop, with order to redeem the English Captives if possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and those Dutch did in Conclusion wilily accomplish their design. For being arrived in the <hi>Pequot</hi> Country, certain Indians coming aboard to trade with them after they had been trafficking they were clapt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Hatches, and told they should not be set at liberty, except they would deliver the English<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> maids that were Captivated, and presently hoysted Sayle, as if they would be gone. The <hi>Pequots</hi> on shore called to them, declaring that if they would come to an Anchor, the English Captives should be brought to them, which was done, and the men whom the Dutchmen had secured in their Sloop given in Exchange for the English Captives, who were also brought safe to <hi>Saybrook,</hi> May, 10. where our Souldiers waited for a wind to carry them to engage with

the <hi>Pequots,</hi> and that Wind which for a few dayes kept the English from going upon their expedition, brought that Dutch Sloop to redeem those Captives, concerning whom there was no other hope (and that was a trouble to some) but that the English would be necessitated to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy them amongst the Indians, in the day when their Fort should be attacqued.</p>

For they told the <hi>Narragansets</hi> that if they joyned with the English, they did but make way for their own Ruine, since after the <hi>Pequots</hi> were conquered, they would find an occasion to fall upon the <hi>Narragansets,</hi> and that they should not need to come to open battel with the English, only fire their Houses, and kill their Cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tel, and lye in ambush to shoot them as they went about their occasions, so would they quickly be forced to leave this Country, and the Indians in the mean while not exposed to any great hazard. Had the <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gansets</hi> been overcome by these Arguments, it would have occasioned far greater Trouble and hazard to all the English Colonyes, newly set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led in this Land; But therefore God in mercy to his people prevented it. Commissioners were then sent from <hi>Boston</hi> into the <hi>Narragansett</hi> Country, to endeavour that those Indians might be kept from Comply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the enemy. There is one who having a little enquired into these things, doth <hi>Relate</hi> that the old <hi>Kanonicus</hi> did disswade the Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quots from war, advising rather to deliver up the murderers. They made believe as if they would do so, and when a Band of Souldiers was sent into the <hi>Pequot</hi> Country for that end, they bid them stay a while, and the murderers should be brought to them, and certain Indians conversing with our Souldiers, did very much observe the Armor which was upon them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and would point where they should hit them with their Arrows, notwithstanding. In fine, when a great Body of Indians ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared on an Hill not far off, those that were with the Souldiers went over to them, when they all came together they gave a scornful shout, and so ran all away, making their boast to others, how they had delu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

After which the <hi>Narragansett,</hi> were not only prevailed with to decline joyning with the enemy, but (as is intimated in the above written Narrative) they pretended they would fight for the English; albeit when it came to in good earnest, they proved themselves Cowards do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing little against the enemies, except by unmanly insultations when they saw them in misery: For whereas it was customary with the <hi>Pequots,</hi> when they had overcome their enemies insultingly to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph, saying, <hi>O brave Pequots!</hi> The <hi>Narragansets</hi> seeing them wounded or consuming to death in their burning wigwams, would taunt

O brave Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quots!</hi> The more of a divine hand is there to be taken notice of in over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming the <hi>Pequots</hi> by a small number of English and Indians. Also the <hi>Pequots</hi> were more furnished with Armes then before times they had been; since the <hi>Dutchmen</hi> had sold some Guns to them; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sides their bowes and arrows they had an abundance of small hatchets, and <hi>Mohawgs<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                  <p>What special acts of valour were manifested by any of our <hi>Comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders</hi> or souldiers in this expedition, beyond what is expressed in the forementioned <hi>Narrattve,</hi> I am not able to <hi>Relate;</hi> Nor am I (though willing that mens vertues should be duely acknowledged<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>) disposed to say much on those accounts, respecting such as are yet alive, as know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that however it may please some by nourishing a proud humour, it would be nauseous to others, and deemed adulatory by wise and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partial Readers.</p>
                  <p>Only I remember Capt. <hi>Davenport</hi> (that good man, who was after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Commander of the Castle at <hi>Boston,</hi> and there slain by lighten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) once told me, that himself, with two or three more, engaged with no lesse then thirty Indians, and that there were seventeen arrows hot into his Coat, but having on a Coat of Male, none of those ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows hurt him, only one that happened to strike where he was not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended by his Coat.</p>
                  <p>Also he rescued a poor souldier, that was in extream danger of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing devoured by those Wolves; For two Mastive-Indians that lay in ambush, as a party of souldiers passed by, supposing they had been all past, snatched hold of him whom they thought to be the last man, and were running away with him upon their shoulders<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Capt. <hi>Daven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port</hi> followed them with his drawn Cutlash, but still as he lifted up his hand to strike at them these <hi>Gigantine Salvages</hi> held up the poor man they were running away with, whereby for a while they secured their own bodyes from the blow, until at last missing the Englishman, Capt. <hi>Davenport</hi> smote one of the Indians, whereupon they threw down their prey, and ran for their lives.</p>
                  <p>He that giveth account of this last passage, doth also <hi>Relate</hi> another particular no lesse pleasant; namely, that whereas the <hi>Pequots</hi> obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the English, being willing to shew as much mercy as would stand with justice, did only captivate and not kill the <hi>Squaws,</hi> some great Indian Boyes would cry, <hi>I Squaw, I Squaw,</hi> thereby thinking to escape with their lives.</p>

But to be serious. That which Governour <hi>Winthrop</hi> writeth in his Letter, published by Mr. <hi>Morton,</hi> is very memorable, <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> that in one fight, though the Indians coming up close to our men, shot their Arrows thick upon them, so as to pierce their hat brims, and their Sleeves, and Stockings, and other parts of their Cloaths, yet so miraculously did the Lord preserve them, as that (excepting three that rashly ventur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a Swamp after them) not one of them was wounded. And tru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to set aside carnal Considerations, there are two Reasons obvious, that may be assigned as causes of that glorious and speedy success, which God gave to the English against the <hi>Pequot</hi> Indians.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The blasphemy of those Enemies. For some of them said, that English mans God was one Flye, which execrable blasphemy the blessed God would not bear from those his Enemies. Also when some English were cruelly tortured to death by them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they would in a way of derision bid them call upon God now, and blasphemously mock at them when they did so. Therefore did the Lord bring those bloody blas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemers in a moment down to Hell, yea, and damned them above ground, when they lay frying in the Fire that was kindled upon their houses, and making horrible Outcries.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There was a mighty Spirit of Prayer and Faith then stirring, both in those that staid at home, and in some what ventured their lives in the high places of the Field. That Reverend man of God Mr. <hi>Wilson</hi> (who excelled in those graces of Faith and Love) went forth with the Soul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers that were sent from this Colony. I think I have my self heard him say, (or if I have not, others have) that <hi>he was before he went out, as certain that God would give the English the Victory over those Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, as if he had seen the Victory already obtained.</hi> Such great Faith did the Lord stir up in the Heart of that Holy man, and of other his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, and by Faith did they <hi>turn to Fight the Armyes of the Aliens.</hi> So then, these Enemies being subdued, in such wayes and by such means as hath been expressed, the Terror of God fell upon all the Heathen round about, and the English were dreadful to them: when they heard that the English had slain, and taken Captive seven hundred Indians, and killed Thirteen <hi>Sachims,</hi> (who are their Kings) there was no more Spirit left in them. The <hi>Pequots</hi> best friends were afraid to receive such as fled to them for Refuge. But happy was he counted that could make friendship with the English, so that two of the <hi>Sachims</hi> in <hi>Long-Island</hi> came to that worthy Gentleman Captain (afterwards Lieut. Colonel) <hi>Stoughton,</hi> entreating that they might be under our protection. Also two of the <hi>Napannet</hi> Sachims, addressed themselves to Governour <hi>Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throp,</hi>

seeking to be in favour with the English. These things de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve to be mentioned amongst the <hi>Magnalia Dei,</hi> which he hath wrought for his <hi>New-England-People.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Matters being again reduced to this peaceable state, that Land rested from war, and that for the space of almost forty years together. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beit Jealousies amongst the English grounded upon Treacheries and Conspiracies amongst the Indians, (and some particular acts of Hostility and Outrages by them committed) there have been, more than once or twice, since the <hi>Pequot-Troubles</hi> were ended.</p>
                  <p>For in Anno 1638. the publick peace was endangered by occasion of a murder committed by an English man upon an Indian. Thus it was. One <hi>Arthur Peach</hi> a young Desperado, who had been a Souldier in the <hi>Pequot</hi> war, and done notable Service, being bold and forward in any desperate Attempt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after he was returned home he was loth to go to work, wherefore he resolved to go to the Dutch Plantation, and enti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced three persons, that were other mens servants, to run away with him. As they were travailing through the woods, they met a <hi>Narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganset Indian,</hi> and desired him to take a pipe of Tobacco, which the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian was willing to do, <hi>Peach</hi> told his <hi>Comrades,</hi> be would kill him; they were afraid to do that, but let him alone to do as he would. When he saw his Time, He ran the Indian through with his Rapier, and took away his <hi>Wampam</hi> from him, supposing he had left him dead, but after they were gone, the Indian made a shift to get home, where he dyed of his wound within few dayes; But told other Indians that such and such Englishmen had mortally wounded him; The <hi>Sachims</hi> therefore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sently found out these men (only one of them escaped) who had done the murder, and carried them away to the English at <hi>Aquidnet</hi> Island, where they were examined and committed. In the mean time the <hi>Narragansets</hi> were about to rise in Arms, some of them conceiving that they should find the <hi>Pequots</hi> words true, that the English would fall up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them, now the other were vanquished. To be short, the murder be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing confessed by the partyes guilty, the Court in <hi>Plymouth</hi> did by ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from Magistrates and elders in the <hi>Bay,</hi> condemn and see executi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on done upon those three <hi>English men</hi> for murdering that one Indian, whereupon the other Indians magnifyed the Justice which they saw amongst the <hi>English,</hi> and peace was continued.

                     </abbr> Mr. <hi>Gorges</hi> and Mr. <hi>Johnson</hi>) have related that <hi>Miantonimo</hi> was set on by certain <hi>vagabond English,</hi> known by the Name of <hi>Gortonians,</hi> who being deep Apostates from, and bitter enemies unto the wayes of Christ, professed by our Fathers, might easily be induced to animate motions of that nature, However <hi>Miantonimo</hi> chose rather to accomplish his ends upon the <hi>Moheags</hi> by Treachery, than by open war; and hired a <hi>Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quot</hi> Indian who was subjected to <hi>Uncas</hi> (the <hi>Moheags Sachim</hi>) to as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sassinate him that was become his Lord, which the Indian attempted ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly; insomuch as on a certain evening as <hi>Uncas</hi> was passing from one <hi>Wigwam</hi> to another, he was shot into the arm by an arrow, but recovered the house he intended, without receiving further hurt.</p>
                  <p>The Indian who was suspected about this matter, being called to an account about a great summ of <hi>Wampam-peag,</hi> by him possessed, could not give any tolerable account, how he came by his money, which augmented jealousies of his being hired by <hi>Miantonimo</hi> to kill <hi>Uncas. Uncas</hi> then made his complaint to the English; the issue was, that <hi>Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antonimo</hi> and the suspected Indian came to <hi>Boston,</hi> where he was exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, at first in the presence of <hi>Miantonimo,</hi> by whose help he had framed an <hi>Artificial Lye,</hi> saying, that one night as he came out of a thick swamp, <hi>Uncas</hi> desired him to say that he was hired by <hi>Miantonimo</hi> to kill <hi>Uncas,</hi> and that therefore he cut his arm with the flint of his Gun, that men might think he had been shot with an arrow. This pittiful story made the English suspect <hi>Miantonimo</hi> more vehemently then ever, and upon a further private examination (much against <hi>Miantonimo'</hi>s mind) they saw cause to believe that he was secretly designing mischief against the English, as well as against <hi>Uncas.</hi> Nevertheless, it was thought best to dismiss him for the present, only with an engagement to remit the suspected <hi>Pequot</hi> to his Master <hi>Uncas:</hi> He contrary to his promise, as he was returning home cut off the poor <hi>Pequots</hi> head, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by he was made uncapable of discovering any thing further about matters between <hi>Miantonimo,</hi> and him.</p>
                  <p>Being come home, he forthwith resolveth to be revenged upon <hi>Uncas,</hi> and with a thousand <hi>Narragansets</hi> gave him battel, but the <hi>Moheags,</hi> (though not half their number) worsted the <hi>Narragan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sets,</hi> and took <hi>Miantonimo,</hi> their chief Sachem, prisoner, and brought him to the Town of <hi>Hartford,</hi> desiring advise from the English con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the disposal of him.

And when upon a partial discharge of the debt, their Hostages were restored to them, they become more backward than formerly, until they were by hostile preparations again and again terrified into better obedience. At last Major <hi>Atherton,</hi> (then Capt. <hi>Atherton</hi>) of <hi>Dorchester</hi> was sent with a small party of English Souldiers to demand what was due.

                  <p>Considering, that the <hi>Narraganset Troubles</hi> have been of no small concernment, it would be worth the while a little more fully to relate the Truth about those motions. Only it is already done in good part by that Declaration which was published by the Commissioners of these united Colonies Anno. 1645. (together with the Articles then con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented unto, and subscribed by the <hi>Narraganset</hi> Sachims) Whoso pleaseth to consult those things will receive satisfaction concerning the <hi>War</hi> which was at that time fully intended, but not actually prosecuted by reason of the Indians Complyance as hath been specified.</p>
                  <p>In Anno. 1646. They failed in the performance of their Covenant, above expressed, as to every particular therein contained.</p>
                  <p>It is also evident that they had by presents of <hi>Wampam</hi> been practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing with the <hi>Mohawks,</hi> and other Indians to engage them against <hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas,</hi> unto whom they knew the English had promised protection. So that the English according to the Rules of Righteousness, might have righted themselves by the justice of <hi>War,</hi> yet being desirous rather to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifest Long-suffering towards these Barbarians, the Commissioners of the united Colonies contented themselves with sending a Declaration to the <hi>Narraganset</hi> and <hi>Niantick</hi> Indians, signifying that they should no longer delay the performance of what they had bound themselves unto, as ever they would not be look'd upon as a trracherous and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidious people, no more to be treated with.</p>
                  <p>This Year also there was <hi>Trouble</hi> and fears raised in the Country, by reason of the <hi>River-Indians,</hi> at <hi>Waranoke, &amp; Norwoottuck,</hi> who it seems were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Before the Commissioners convened, Mr. <hi>Haines</hi> had twice sent to <hi>Sequasson;</hi> but he neglected to make his appearance: Wherefore <hi>Jonathan Gilbert</hi> was sent to him again, to signifie from the Commissio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners that they expected <hi>Sequassons</hi> appearance before them, and to answer what he was accused with, and they promised him free passage both to and from <hi>Newhaven,</hi> withall intimating that his withdrawing himself would greatly augment the suspition of his guilt.</p>
                  <p>The Messenger quickly returned, bringing word, that he could not speak with <hi>Sequasson,</hi> who he supposed had received notice of his coming by other Indians, and was thereupon <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>But a few days after, <hi>Nipnisoit</hi> and <hi>Naimetayhu</hi> two <hi>Sagamores,</hi> came with some other Indians to <hi>Newhaven,</hi> declaring that they were friends to <hi>Sequasson,</hi> and pretended great respect to the English, and that they had brought <hi>Sequasson</hi> to clear himself, and that although one of them had him by one arm, another by the other, when he was come near the town, he brake from them and was escaped.</p>
                  <p>The Commissioners told them they intended <hi>Sequasson</hi> no hurt; but desired to bring him and his accusers face to face, that he should have a just hearing in their presence.</p>
                  <p>Some other Indians informed that <hi>Sequasson</hi> was within a mile of <hi>Newhaven,</hi> and it was conceived that he would gladly make his peace by some other means, rather then by a due examination and Trial. The two <hi>Sagamores</hi> said he was much afraid, and durst not come, though they confessed it was just he should come and clear himself, if innocent; all which being considered, the Commissioners conceived that <hi>Sequasson</hi> whether guilty or afraid of the English, would still be plotting against them and so prove dangerous; wherefore they thought fit, and ordered that all just and prudent means should be used (his life being preserved) to bring him to a tryal, that the matter might be some way issued. In the mean time they thought good to examine <hi>Wotchiborow</hi> a <hi>Pocatuck</hi> Indian <hi>Sequassons</hi> accuser, who waited to give in evidence against him.

For whilst the Commissioners were sitting at <hi>Newhaven,</hi> petitions were presented from <hi>Edward Elmere</hi> and some others, complaining that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians had wilfully and maliciously burned some quantity of pitch, and Tarr of theirs, together with some bedding, and a Cart with its furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and tooles &amp;c. in value above an hundred pounds. And particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly they complained of one <hi>Wasemose,</hi> a <hi>Waranoke</hi> Indian as guilty therein, as by sufficient evidence they thought they could prove; and that he hath since avoided all the English Plantations; and that he being sent for by a warrant from one of the Magistrates of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> fled; but being overtaken and seized by some of the English, he was rescued by the Indians, and the English by them jeered and abused, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly <hi>Chickwallop</hi> Sachim of <hi>Norwootuck:</hi> Whereupon <hi>Jonathan Gilbert</hi> and <hi>John Grissin,</hi> were sent to <hi>Chickwallop and Manasanes.</hi>

                  <p>At their return, they informed that they could not meet either with <hi>Chickwallop</hi> or <hi>Manasanes,</hi> but the <hi>Sagamores</hi> and Indians at <hi>Wara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noke</hi> carried it insolently towards the English, vaunting themselves in their Arms, bows and Arrows, hatchets and Swords, some with their Guns ready charged, before and in the presence of the English Mes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sengers, they primed and cockt them ready to give fire, and told them, that if they should offer to carry away any men thence, the Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were resolved to sight, yet the next morning the <hi>Sachim</hi> with some others offered the English Messengers eight Fathom of <hi>Wampam</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards satisfaction, and promised to provide more. The Messengers not having any thing to that purpose in their Commission, advised the <hi>Sachim</hi> to send to the Commissioners, but he refused. Hereupon, <hi>Naymetayhu</hi> one of the <hi>Sagamores</hi> of <hi>Waranoke,</hi> who, as before, came on <hi>Sequasson<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </hi> behalf, was questioned by the Commissioners about these proud Affronts to the English; At first he denyed what was charged, and excused some part, but one of the English Messengers being pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and he hearing the rest should be sent for, he fell under most of the charge, professing that he intended no harm to the English, Thus concerning disturbance by the Indians in the yerr, 1646.</p>
                  <p>In Anno, 1647. New fears and troubles arose by reason of the <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raganset</hi> Indians, there being credible Informations that they were plot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, and by presents of <hi>Wampam</hi> ingaging the Indians round about to combine with them against the English Colonyes, insomuch that a meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Commissioners was called before the ordinary time; Being therefore convened at <hi>Boston,</hi> July 26. A Messenger was sent to <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raganset,</hi> signifying to <hi>Pesicut</hi> and other <hi>Sachims</hi> there, that the English Commissioners expected their appearance at <hi>Boston,</hi> and that if they

did refuse or delay, they should no more be sent unto, withal promising them safe conduct, inCase they duly attended. The Messenger being returned informed that <hi>Pesicus</hi> excused his not meeting the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>missioners at <hi>New Haven</hi> the last year, from his ignorance of the time. when he should attend, though that was falsly pretended by him. He also desired excuse for his not appearing at this time, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he said he was sick, and not able to come, (but the Messengers could not perceive that he was subject to any such sickness or disable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) Nevertheless, he had given full power to <hi>Ninnigret</hi> to act on his behalf. Moreover, he excused his not performing the <hi>Articles</hi> he had subscribed at <hi>Boston,</hi> two years before, by pretending that he was frighted into that Engagement, with the sight of the English Army, which was then ready to invade the <hi>Narraganset</hi> Country, and he thought they would follow him home, and there kill him if he did not promise to do as the English would have him.</p>

                  <p>This year other <hi>Troubles</hi> hapned by some of <hi>Vncas</hi> his Indians, who committed several Outrages upon the English in the <hi>Pequot</hi> Country. Mr. <hi>John Winthrop,</hi> &amp; some with him, complained that <hi>Wowequay</hi> (<hi>Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cas</hi> his brother) with about forty <hi>Moheags,</hi> behaved themselves inso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lently hovering against the English Plantation in a suspicious manner, to the afrightment of the Inhabitants there; Also, although <hi>Uncas</hi> at first seemed gladly to entertain the English plantation at <hi>Pequot,</hi> yet his carriage since was such as if he designed by <hi>Alarums</hi> to disturb and break that plantation.

                  <p>These Counsils were so far ripened and prepared for execution, as that <hi>Thomas Stanton</hi> and other messengers from <hi>Connecticut,</hi> goeing to the Indians to enquire into<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and (if it might be) stop proceedings, found them met at <hi>Pacomptuck</hi> their Randeavouze, who acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they had received <hi>Wampam</hi> from the <hi>Narragansets</hi> to invade <hi>Uncas,</hi> and that they were met together to that purpose, expecting <hi>Mohawks</hi> and other Indians to make up their full numbers: But hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring that two <hi>Mohawk</hi> Sachims, were lately killed by the Eastern In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians, and that the English, who they thought were a just and war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like people, would defend <hi>Uncas,</hi> they did therefore stop their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded proceedings at this time.</p>

                  <p>About four years after this (<abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> in Anno 1653.) there were great <hi>Troubles,</hi> and Commotions raised in the Spirits of men with reference to the Indians, it being generally believed that there was an horrid Conspi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racy amongst the Indians throughout this Land to cut off all the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish, and that they were animated thereto by the Dutch, there being at that time war between England and Holland. An Indian <hi>Squaw</hi> was sent by other Indians (that professed love and friendship) to one in <hi>Wethersfield</hi> on <hi>Connecticut,</hi> informing that there was a Confederacy between the Dutch and indians, to destroy the English Colonyes, and that the day of Election of Magistrates in the several Jurisdictions was intended for execution, because then the Towns would be left naked and less able to defend themselves. This Squaw moreover desired the English to remember, how dear their slighting of her former informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the <hi>Pequots</hi> coming had cost them.</p>
                  <p>Also. <hi>Uncas</hi> addressed himself to the Governour of <hi>Connecticut</hi> Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lony declaring that <hi>N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="68" facs="unknown:000238_0073_0FA36E30893095B8"/>
and that during his stay in those parts he went over <hi>Hudsons</hi> River, gathered as many <hi>Sachims</hi> together as he could, made ample Declaration against the English, desiring their aid and assistance against them.</p>
                  <p>Yea moreover, there were no less then nine Indian <hi>Sagamores,</hi> who lived near <hi>Manhatos,</hi> did voluntarily without any notice or reward from the English, send their Messengers to <hi>Stamford,</hi> declaring and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming (even after they were urged by the English to testifie nothing but the truth) that the Dutch had sollicited them by promising them Gunns, Swords, Powder, Wampam, Wast-coats and Coats to cut off the English. The Messengers added that they would not lye, &amp; were as the mouth of the nine Sagamores, who <hi>All speak they no lye,</hi> they would affirm it to the Dutch Governours face, and if the Dutch were angry, and should fight with them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
                     <hi>No force &amp;c.</hi> The next day, one of those Sagamores, with the Son and Brother of another of them came themselves to <hi>Stamford,</hi> and confirmed what their Messengers in their names had before reported.</p>
                  <p>This Spring also, the Indians in the <hi>Northern &amp; Eastern</hi> parts gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally grew insolent, and their carriage very suspitious, and they gave out threatning words, so that many Alarms were made, the peace of the English through the whole Country disturbed, they wearied with ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Watchings and Wardings, hindred in their Plowing, Sow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preparations for Planting and other Occasions, to their exceeding great Damage. These things caused many sad thoughts of hearts, and some warlike Preparations; but when the Partyes accused were enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of about these matters they would own nothing; as for <hi>Ninigret</hi> he pretended that his wintering amongst the Dutch was on the account of his health, and not at all out of design against the English. The rest of the <hi>Narraganset Sachims</hi> made themselves very ignorant of any Plot; the Dutch Governour likewise professed great abhorrency of so vile a thing as that would be, to hire barbarous Indians to murder Christians; withall adding, that if the Colonies fell upon him on that account, the righteous Judge would be his Defence, and that,
<q>
                        <lg>

Also glad tidings of peace between the Nations at home arrived here so did these troubles vanish.</p>
                  <p>Albeit not many years after these things, the Indians in those parts made an horrible slaughter, not of English-men but of Dutch-men, who were treacherously massacred by them.</p>

In the latter end of this year it was, that the <hi>Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>taukes</hi> or Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Island Indians who were friends and Tributaryes to the English, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained that <hi>Ninnigret</hi> and the <hi>Nianticks</hi> had assaulted them, killing and taking Captive diverse of them. They were so far hearkned un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as that the Commissioners of the united Colonies did apprehend themselves called of God to wage Warr against <hi>Ninigret,</hi> and such Indians as should adhere to him in his bloudy proceedings, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly did by vote conclude and determine the same, and that two hundred and fifty Souldiers should be forthwith raised, and sent forth by the several Colonies. But the Council at <hi>Boston</hi> not concurring in those Conclusions, the intended expedition failed at that time. Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheless the next year, it being known that <hi>Ninnigret</hi> persisted in his Warring upon the Long Islanders, and that he brake his Covenant, refusing to pay tribute for those <hi>Pequots</hi> that were by the English for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly placed under him, and that the lenity of the Colonies was ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>used to heighten his pride and insolency; upon these Considerations it was agreed by the Commissioners that there should be two hundred and seventy Foot Souldiers, and forty Horse, raised out of the several Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonyes, in order to reducing <hi>Ninnigret</hi> to subjection and better obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Accordingly Forces were forthwith levied, and a small Army sent forth under the Christian and couragious Major <hi>Willard</hi> as Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander in chief.</p>
                  <p>Upon the approach of the English Army <hi>Ninnigret</hi> fled from the place of his usual Residence, and got into a Swamp, where it was not casie to pursue him. Most of the <hi>Pequots</hi> under his Jurisdiction then deser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted him, and came to the English. Messengers were sent to demand a Treaty with him, but he was afraid to appear.</p>
                  <p>In fine, two Gentlemen, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Capt. <hi>Davis</hi> and Capt. <hi>Siely</hi> went to him requiring the delivery of the rest of the <hi>Pequots;</hi> to whom he replyed that they were gone on hunting, but ingaged that within seven dayes they should be delivered to Mr. <hi>Winthrop.</hi> He was moreover charged to forbear all acts of Hostility against the Long-Islanders, or any other Indians that were in amity with the English; and plainly told, that if he did not hearken to the advice and charge laid upon him, he must expect that ere long his head would be set upon an English pole.</p>
                  <p>So did the Messengers return and the Army also. These things hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in October Anno 1654.</p>
                  <p>After the English forces were withdrawn, <hi>Ninnigret</hi> did according to his usual manner, observe <hi>Fidem punicam</hi> in keeping the promises which at that time he had made and set his hand unto.</p>

Not many years after this the Indians in the Southern and Western parts of this Land were involved in broyles amongst themselves, raging with implacable feuds and wars one against another. The <hi>Nianticks, Maunta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

And the peace of these Colonyes was not a little disturbed and endangered thereby, inasmuch as the Indians would pursue one a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother to the English plantations, and sometimes into the English hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses, and there kill one another. Some English at <hi>Wethersfield,</hi> and some inhabiting in the <hi>Moheag</hi> Country were by means here of put in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to sad frights. In special, in Anno 1658, sundry English in divers pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces were disquieted by the insolence and outrage of the <hi>Pacumptick</hi> In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians. But when the <hi>Sachims</hi> were called to an account about it, they pretended that they were ignorant of what disorders were committed by their men, nor allowed of by them who desired to live in amity with the English, and were willing to give satisfaction for past injuryes, and to prevent the like abuses for the Future. So did those Troubles pass over. Not very long before this, at <hi>South-Hampton</hi> in <hi>Long Island</hi> some houses had been burned by a wicked Indian (and a <hi>Negro</hi> wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man) who it seems after he had done this wickedness, desperately killed himself, to prevent just execution. It was at first thought that more of the Indians there had had an hand in that burning, whence they were condemned to pay seven hundred pound in seven years, but afterwards that penalty was taken off, since it was judged unreasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that those Indians who were not proved to act in, or consent to the mischief that was done, should be made to suffer as guilty.</p>
                  <p>In Anno 1662, <hi>Plymouth</hi> Colony was in some danger of being invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved in Trouble by the <hi>Wam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

After <hi>Massasoit</hi> was dead, his two sons, called <hi>Wamsutta,</hi> &amp; <hi>Metacomet,</hi> came to the court at <hi>Plymouth</hi> pretending high respect for the English<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore desired English names might be imposed on them, whereupon the Court there named <hi>Wamsutta</hi> (the elder brother) <hi>Alexander,</hi> and <hi>Metacomet</hi> (the younger brother) <hi>Philip;</hi> this <hi>Alexander</hi> (<hi>Philips</hi> immediate predecessor) was not so faithful and friendly to the English as his Father had been. For some of <hi>Boston</hi> having been occasionally at <hi>Narraganset,</hi> wrote to Mr. <hi>Prince</hi> who was then Governour of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> that <hi>Alexander</hi> was contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving mischief against the English, and that he had sollicited the <hi>Nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragangansets</hi> to ingage with him in his designed rebellion. Hereupon, Capt. <hi>Willet</hi> (who lived near to <hi>Mount-Hope,</hi> the place where <hi>Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander</hi> did reside) was appointed to speak with him and to desire him to attend the next Court in <hi>Plymouth,</hi> for their satisfaction, and his own

But when the day for his appearance was come, instead of that, he at that very time went over to the <hi>Narragansets</hi> his pretended enemies, which compared with other Circumstances, caused the Gentlemen at <hi>Plymouth</hi> to suspect there was more of Truth in the Information given, than at first they were aware of. Wherefore the Governour and Magistrates there, ordered Major <hi>Winslow</hi> (who is since and at this day the Governour of that Colony) to take a party of men, and fetch down <hi>Alexander.</hi> The Major considering that <hi>semper nocuit differre parat is,</hi> he took but ten armed men with him from <hi>Marshfield,</hi> intending to have taken more at the Towns that lay nearer <hi>Mount-Hope.</hi> But divine providence so ordered, as that when they were about the midway between <hi>Plymouth</hi> and <hi>Briagwater,</hi> observing an hunting house, they rode up to it, and there did they find <hi>Alexander</hi> and many of his men well armed, but their Guns standing together without the house, the Major with his small party, possessed themselves of the Indians Arms, and beset the house; then did he go in amongst them, acquainting the <hi>Sachim</hi> with the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son of his coming in such a way, desiring <hi>Alexander</hi> with his Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to walk out with him, who did so a little distance from the house, and then understood what Commission the <hi>Major</hi> had received con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him. The proud <hi>Sachim</hi> fell into a raging passion at this sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prise, saying that the Governour had no reason to credit Rumors, or to send for him in such a way<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor would he go to <hi>Plymouth</hi> but when he saw cause. It was replyed to him, that his breach of word touching ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance at <hi>Plymouth</hi> Court, and instead thereof going at the same time to his pretended enemies, augmented jealousies concerning him. I<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> fine, the <hi>Major</hi> told him, that his order was to bring him to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and that (by the help of God) he would do it, or else he would dy on the place; Also declaring to him that if he would submit, he might ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect respective usage, but if he once more denyed to go, he should ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver stir from the ground whereon he stood, and with a Pistol at the <hi>Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chims</hi> breast, required that his next words should be a positive and clear Answer to what was demanded. Hereupon his Interpreter (a discreet Indian, brother to <hi>John Sausaman</hi>) being sensible of <hi>Alexanders</hi> passionate disposition, entreated that he might speak a few words to the <hi>Sachim,</hi> before he gave his Answer. The prudent discourse of this Indian pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed so far as that <hi>Alexander</hi> yielded to go, only requesting that he might go like a <hi>Sachim,</hi> with his men attending him, which (although
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:000238_0077_0FA36E3387A7BB68"/>
there was some hazard in it, they being many, and the English but a few) was granted to him. The weather being hot, the Major offered him and horse to ride on, but his squaw and diverse Indian women be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in company, he refused, saying he could go on foot as well as they, entreating only that there might be a complying with their place, which was done, and resting several times by the way, <hi>Alexander</hi> and his Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans were refreshed by the English; no other discourse hapning while they were upon their march, but what was pleasant and amicable. The <hi>Major</hi> sent a man before, to entreat that as many of the Magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strates of that Colony as could; would meet at <hi>Duxbury;</hi> wherefore ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving there had some treaty with <hi>Alexander,</hi> not willing to commit him to prison, they entreated Major <hi>Winslow</hi> to receive him to his house, until the Governour (who then lived at <hi>Eastham</hi>) could come up. Accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly he and his Train were courteously entertained by the Major. And albeit not so much as an angry word passed between them whilst at <hi>Marshfield,</hi> yet proud <hi>Alexander</hi> vexing and fretting in his spirit, that such a check was given him, he sudeenly fell sick of a fever. He was then nursed as a choice friend. Mr. <hi>Fuller</hi> (the Physitian) coming providentially thither at that time, the Sachim and his men earnestly desired that he would administer to him, which he was unwilling to doe, but by their importunity was prevailed with to doe the best he could to help him, and therefore gave him a potion of working Physick, which the Indians thought did him good; but his distemper afterward prevailing, they entreated to dismiss him, in order to a return home, which upon engagement of appearance at the next Court was granted to him, soon after his being returned home, he dyed.</p>
                  <p>And this is the truth and substance of what concerns Transactions with <hi>Alexander,</hi> concerning which so many fabulous storyes have been spread abroad.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Alexander</hi> being dead, his Brother <hi>Philip</hi> (of late cursed memory) rose up in his stead, and he was no sooner styled <hi>Sachim,</hi> but immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately in the year 1662. there were vehement suspitions of his bloudy treachery against the English: Yet he professed otherwise, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king his personal appearance at a Court holden at Plymouth, renewed that Covenant which his father and Brother had confirmed with the English there. This Covenant he per<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>idiously brake: For in Anno 1671. it was evident that he with other his Confederates had been conspiring against the Colony, under whose protection and Jurisdicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on he had submitted himself. He then armed himself and acted like a Rebel that intended a speedy rising, yea he ordered (as some Indians
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:000238_0078_0FA36E3448112B98"/>
have since confessed) that if the English did send messengers to Treat with him, if above four came in company together they should be shot down, and appointed some to ly in ambush for that end; and behaved himself after a surly and provoking manner towards messengers that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sired Treaty with him, and refused to appear, and give answer for his Insolencyes, his Covenant notwithstanding. Nevertheless, he at last conceded to meet the Governour and Magistrates of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> at <hi>Taun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton;</hi> where sundry Commissioners of <hi>Boston</hi> were desired to be, and to hear the matters of difference between the English of <hi>Plymouth,</hi> and this <hi>Philip</hi> Sachim.—This meeting was attended in <hi>April,</hi> 1671. when <hi>Philip</hi> confessed his breach of Covenant, and that he had groundlesly taken up Arms against them, whom he had alwayes found friendly to him; And surrendred some of his Arms, engaging for the delivery of the rest in due time. The English being tender of shedding blood, let him go upon promise of better behaviour for the future. Soon after this, <hi>Philip</hi> (with some of his Counsellors) repaired to <hi>Boston,</hi> endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring to possess the English there, with lying Informations, about In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juryes done to him by those of <hi>Plymouth.</hi> Wherefore the Council of that Colony entreated that Commissioners from <hi>Boston,</hi> and from <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi> also might be sent to <hi>Plymouth,</hi> that so a fair hearing of diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences before all the world might be attended. So then in <hi>September</hi> following the Governour of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> and several Magistrates from the <hi>Massachusets,</hi> and some other Gentlemen met at <hi>Plymouth,</hi> where <hi>Philip</hi> appeared, and all his allegations were heard to the Conviction of <hi>Philip</hi> himself, and great satisfaction of all that Audience. The con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion was, <hi>Philip</hi> acknowledged his offence, and was appointed to give a sum of mony to defray the charges which his Insolent Clamours had put that Colony unto.

Some of these Covenants were in part observed by him, and some particulars not at all—Thus did things rest between the English and him, until the year 1674. when in <hi>January</hi> an Indian Preacher, known by the name of <hi>John Sausaman,</hi> addressed himself to the present Governour of <hi>Pli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth,</hi> informing him that the Indians were compl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

This <hi>Sansaman</hi> was by birth a <hi>Massachuset,</hi> his Father and Mother living in <hi>Dorchester,</hi> and they both died Christians. This their Son did for some time apostatize from his Christian profession, and lived like an Heathen, being Philips Secretary (for he could write a ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry legible hand) and one of his Counsellors, untill at last God convinced him of his misery, and he manifested such evident signs of repentance as that he was, after his return from pagan <hi>Philip,</hi> reconciled to the praying Indians and baptised, and received as a member in one of the Indian Churches, yea and imployed as an Instructor amongst them every Lords Day. Nevertheless, his information (because it had an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian original, and one can hardly believe them when they speak truth) was not at first much regarded, untill by relation of Circumstance<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The effect was, the Governour of <hi>Plymouth</hi> advising with his Councill, resol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved once more to send for <hi>Philip,</hi> and to enquire into the truth of things: But before that could be accomplished, an Indian called <hi>Tobi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as,</hi> with his Son, and another Indian named <hi>Matta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

It be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rumor'd that <hi>Sausaman</hi> was lost, the dead body was sought after, and found in the pond, and taken up and buried.</p>
                  <p>Jealousies being on the spirits of men that the other Indians had murthered him, on the account of revealing their Conspiracyes to the English: The Governour of <hi>Plymouth</hi> ordered the Constable of <hi>Mia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

way that the Indians some times use when they practice murthers, also, his head was extreamly swollen, and his Body was wounded in several parts of it, and when it was first taken out of the pond, no water issued out of it, which argued that the Body was not drowned, but dead be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it came into the water.</p>
                  <p>Moreover, when <hi>Tobias</hi> (the suspected Murtherer) came near the dead body, it fell a bleeding on fresh as if it had been newly slain albeit it was buried a considerable time before that.</p>
                  <p>Afterward an Indian called <hi>Patuckson,</hi> came and testified to their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that he saw <hi>Tobias</hi> and the other Indians murthering <hi>Sausaman:</hi> He also himself before his death had declared, that he was afraid those very Indians would at last prove his Murtherers.</p>

                  <p>It is easy to observe; from the <hi>History</hi> of these <hi>Troubles,</hi> that whereas there have been two sorts of men designing settlement in this part of <hi>America,</hi> some that came hither on the account of Trade, and world<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Interests, by whom the Indians have been scandalized, others that came hither on a Religious and conscientious account, having in their Eye, the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <head>An HISTORICAL DISCOURSE Concerning the Prevalency of PRAYER</head>
                  <p>IT was a great word (and if rightly understood, a true word) which <hi>Luther</hi> spake, when he said, <hi>Est quaeaam precum Omnipotentia,</hi> there is a kind of Omnipotency in Prayer; And the reason is obvious, <abbr>
                        <hi>viz.</hi>
                     </abbr> In that the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty doth suffer himself to be prevailed upon and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vercome by prayer. Had not Jacob in this respect power with God? yea when he made his supplication, he had power, and prevailed over the Angel, even that Angel who is the Lord of Hosts, the Lord is his memorial. Where do we find in all the Book of God a more wonderfull expression, then that of the Lord to praying Moses, <hi>Now let me alone?</hi> That ever the eternal God should become thus a petitioner to a poor mortal man! <note place="margin">
                        <hi>See Mr</hi> Hall, <hi>Psal.</hi> 82 <hi>p.</hi> 183 184.</note> 
                     <hi>Feriendi licentiam petit a Mose qui fecit Mosen.</hi> Prayer then is like the sword of Saul, or the bow of Jonathan, which never re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned empty from the battle. Prayer is stronger then iron gates. At the prayers of the Church the Iron gates fly open, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>postles fetters fall off. Sometimes the prayers of one man that hath an eminent interest in God, are a means to preserve a whole town, yea a whole land from destruction; wel might the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient say, <note place="margin">Chrysostom.</note> 
                     <hi>Homine probo orante nihil potentius.</hi> How far did Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hams prayers prevail for Sodom? Did not Elijah's prayers open and shut the windows of Heaven? Did they not bring down show<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers when the gasping earth was ready to dy for thirst? When a
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000238_0086_0FA36E3A489E1DA0"/>
fiery drought had like to have devoured the land of Israel, and the Prophet Amos prayed and cried to the Lord, saying, <hi>O Lord God, Cease I beseech thee, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>r this, and said this shall not be.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Wars, when justly undertaken, have been successfull through the prevalency of prayer. Moses in the mount praying, is too strong for all the Armies in the valley fighting. When the Phili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stines went up against the Children of Israel, <hi>Samuel</hi> ceased not to cry to the Lord for Israel, and the Lord thundred with a great thunder that day upon the Philistines, and discomfited them, that they were smitten before Israel. <hi>Jehoshaphat,</hi> when surrounded by a multitude of heathen enemyes, by prayer overcame them, When <hi>Z</hi>erah the Ethiopian, came against the Lords people with an host of a thousand thousand men, <hi>Asa</hi> by prayer and faith over came them all. <hi>Hezekiah</hi> and <hi>Isaiah</hi> by their prayers brought an Angel down from heaven, who slew an hundred and fourescore and five thousand Assyrians, in the host of Sennacherib, in one night.</p>
                  <p>And besides these, and many other Scriptural examples, in ecclesiastical story Instances to this purpose are frequently ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served. <note place="margin">

In this extremity, a Legion of Christian souldiers being in the Army, withdrew themselves apart from the rest, and falling prostrate on the earth, by ardent prayers prevailed with God, that he immediately sent a most plentifull rain, whereby the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my that otherwise had perished, was refreshed, and dreadfull lightenings flashed in the faces of their enemyes so as that they were discomfited and put to flight.

God by a strange providence, sent Major <hi>Willard,</hi> who with a smal party of souldiers, came a few hours or minutes before it was too late, by which means the remaining Inhabitants of that place had their lives given them for a prey.

That memorable providence ought not to be forgotten, how that in the beginning of March, 1676. Our Army missed their way (designing to surprize the Indians about <hi>Wachuset</hi> Hills) and were providentially led to North Hampton; Also Major <hi>Treat</hi> with souldiers under his Command, did then take up his Quarters in that town, coming thither a day sooner then was intended; The next day a great body of Indians brake in upon the town, and in probability had laid it wast, had there not been such a supply of souldiers as hath been mentioned, which the good providence of God brought thither, in answer to the prayers of his people. Moreover, the whole Colony of <hi>Plymouth</hi> was in most apparent danger of being overrun and overwhelmed with the enemy; especially in the spring of the year 1676. when (as we have been informed) the Indians were designing, with fifteen hundred men to fall upon all the scat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered towns throughout that Jurisdiction. But God gave men, yea a great <hi>Sachim,</hi> for the life of his dear people in that Colony. We have heard that <hi>Quanonch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But I speak now concerning those that have been Captives amongst the heathen in this land. And God hath heard us for them.

Amongst others, the son of that man of God, and man of prayer, Reverend Mr. <hi>Cobbet</hi> (the faithfull Pastor of the Church in Ipswich) was surprized in a vessel by the Northern Indians, and led away into Captivity; doubtless God did it, that so glory might be to his holy name, and that the world might see how prayer can prevail with him. Mr.<hi>Cobbet</hi> no soon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er heard what was befallen his son, but he called together about thirty of his Christian neighbours (that being as many as could on the sudden convene) and they set some time apart to pray for him that was now a Captive, after this his Fathers heart was sweetly quieted, believing that God had heard them: Some others also that attended that Service, were as confidently perswaded that God would return (and that in comfortable plight) Mr.<hi>Cobbets</hi> son to him again, as if he were already come; Prayer also was made in pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Congregations in particular for that young man; and in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember following, those prayers were fully answered, the Lord bringing it about in strange wayes, the particulars and circumstan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces whereof are too large here to be insisted on.</p>

Poets. Among others that came to pray with this poor miserable man, Mr. <hi>Rothwel</hi> (a minister that was famous in those parts in those dayes) was one. As he was coming, the Divel told them in the house with the possessed man, yonder is <hi>Rothwel</hi> a coming; and upon his entring into the house, raged and blasphemed, saying also wilt thou go to prayer, I'le make such a noise as shall distract thee, and dost thou think that God will hear distracted prayers? Mr. <hi>Rothwel</hi> replyed, God heareth the prayers of the upright, and hath promised to give his spirit to help infirmityes in prayer; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in Confidence of his promise, &amp; powerful assistance of his spirit, and in the name of his son Jesus Christ, we will go to prayer.

After Mr. Rothwel left him, he was striken dumb for three years together; at length by prayer also, God opened his mouth, and restored his speech to him; One using this Petition, Lord open his mouth, and his lips shall shew forth thy praise; he answered in the Congregation, <hi>Amen,</hi> and so continued to speak, and spake graciously to his dying day.</p>

<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000238_0101_0FA36E45DE62CB18"/>
promise was made not to speak of it whilst he was alive in this world. Upon this he said, <hi>O what am I being dust and ashes, that the holy Ministring spirits should be sent by the Lord to deliver a message to me,</hi> and shewed that Angels from heaven had by an audible voice given him answer concerning that which he had been praying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout. [This was a thing extraordinary, and in no wise to be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Christians ordinarily] and returning into his house, he bid those that were in the room with his wife, be of good comfort; for he was assured that within ten hours she should be delivered from that distraction. After this he went to prayer by the bed side, and as he was in prayer mentioning Jacobs wrestling with God, his wife sate up in the bed, and casting aside the curtain said, <hi>Thou art this day Jacob, thou hast wrestled, and hast prevailed, and now God hath made good his word which he spake to you this morning, for I am pluck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out of the hands of Satan, and he shall no more have power over me.</hi> This interruption made him silent for a while, but after in great mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of heart he proceeded in prayer, magnifiing the riches of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine grace and love, and from that hour his wife continued to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course christianly and comfortably even to her dying hour.</p>
                  <p>And as for those spiritual (which are worse then bodily possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons) that Satan holds in the Souls of men, how often hath prayer been a means to out him, and cause him (full sore against his will) to quit his strong hold for ever. <note place="margin">Clark, <hi>

shut his chamber door and went to prayer, and the hostler standing at the door over heard him, and was converted by that prayer; ever after that time highly respecting Mr. <hi>Welch,</hi> and refusing to accept of any thing for his entertainment, either then or at any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther times afterwards, when occasion was offered.</p>
                  <p>I knew one, the son of an holy, and eminently faithfull Minister, who in some of the dayes of his youth had been wild and vain, but was (through the Grace of Christ) converted in his young years, and after his Fathers death, perusing his private papers, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that not many dayes before he was in the pangs of the new birth, his Father had been by secret Fasting and prayer seeking un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord that converting sanctif<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>One of his sons being absent at sea, On a certain night he rose early, before break of day, and came to his familiar friend <hi>John Steward,</hi> and desired him to rise, and go with him into a room to pray, for (said he) my son with the rest of our Christian friends now at sea, are at the very nick of perishing. After he had spent some time in pouring out his soul before the Lord, he rose up cheerfully, saying, <hi>now are they safe.</hi> John Steward being amazed thereat, writ this down, with the day and hour, and at the return of the ship made enquiry, and found that in that very hour of that night, they then were in a most dangerous place, so that all hope that they should be saved was taken away, only they were by an extraordinary unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected providence then delivered.</p>

To draw to a Conclusion, let the world beware, of doing any wronge to a praying people. Such blasting strokes from God were upon those that set themselves against the reformed Churches and Professors (who were called <hi>Piccardines</hi>) in <hi>Bohemia</hi> of old that it became a proverbial speech, <hi>If any man be weary of his life, let him become an enemy to the Piccaraines.</hi> So I say, <hi>If any man be weary of his life, let him become an enemy to a Praying People,</hi> such as (through grace) many in <hi>New-England</hi> have been, and are to this day. And wo to that man, whoever he be, upon whom the Prayers of <hi>New-England</hi> shall fall, it were better for that man that a mill-stone were hanged about his neck, and he thrown there with into the midst of the Sea. It is said concerning the Witnesses, Rev. 11. 5. <q>if any man hurt them, fire proceedeth out of their mouth, and devoureth their enemies, and if any man will hurt them, he must on this manner be killed.</q> Is not the spirit of prayer that fire? That Scottish Queen once professed, that she was more afaaid of Mr. <hi>Knox</hi> his prayers, then of an army of ten thousand men.</p>
