            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE FEMALE CHARACTER VINDICATED.</head>
            <p>INJUDICIOUS cenſure rarely ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects reformation—the ſhafts of ridicule are formidable to the votories of folly— but unleſs aimed by accurate judgment and pointed by ſkill, prove not only un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>availing and futile, but alſo wound the intereſt of humanity: Wit rolled forth without diſcretion, often, nay always, precipitates the author into baſe invective and ſcurrilous ſlander. It is really to be lamented, that in every age our beſt ſatiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal writers have indulged themſelves in this, and laid aſide all candour, modeſty, and juſtice, in treating of the <hi>fair ſex,</hi>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:028664_0003_0FDA3E1E762A2278"/>and have uniformly degraded their brilliant effuſions of wit and humour, with the tarteſt ſneers of malignity. The moroſe moraliſt, the ſnarling cynic, and bigotted enthuſiaſt, all concur in maintaining opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions unfavourable to the fairer half of the human race. How baſe, how degrading in a gentleman, to indulge himſelf in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>humanity where he knows no oppoſition will be made! The blackeſt dye is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely too white to draw his portrait—he dares not ſtep forth and aſperſe characters where he knows he will be bravely oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—but ſneaks, with the aſſaſſin, and ſtabs the unarmed—he is bold and intrepid where no danger appears—he is baſely in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human where his opponent cannot reſiſt— ſuch is the character of every coward— Recoil O humanity at the ſcene! Weep O true and virtuous valour! In the aera when bodily ſtrength was the ſole <hi>virtue</hi> and criterion of merit, then I grant wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men were juſtly conſidered as inferior— but now, when it is the mental accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments that form the <hi>man</hi>—now, when real merit is the criterion of greatneſs, why ſhould the artillery of ſarcaſm be levelled at the citadel of ſemale excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence? Who can read the writings of
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:028664_0004_0FDA3DFE18F7E438"/>Swift upon this ſubject, without perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his feelings raiſed, even to perfect ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence? Who can realize the ſatires of the immortal Young, as ſentiments really candid, without lamenting his irrecovera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſgrace? In his Night thoughts, he draws the character of his wife and daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the pencil of perfection, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects honour on the whole ſex. In his Satires on Women, he deſcends to ſcurri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and invective, and (pardon the expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion) holds forth ideas familiar only to the debauchee—how does reaſon, how does charity recoil at viewing a man of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ſenſe, of conſummate erudition, and of renowned piety, expoſing thoſe unjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly who cannot vindicate their cauſe.

               </gap>ally more deprav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, inferior, and unworthy our friendly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe. The cauſe of the diſparity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:028664_0005_0FDA3E219A67EB10"/>the two ſexes, appears ſo obvious to need but little explication; which I conceive to exiſt wholly in the degree and method of their education.—"'Tis education forms the tender mind."</p>
            <p>That the ladies are as capable of eru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as the men, cannot be denied by thoſe capable of obſervation—only viſit a common Engliſh ſchool—does not incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtible experience declare, that there the ladies make the moſt accurate and rapid progreſs? It is futile and ridiculous to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, that the ladies are capable of a certain degree of education only—and that a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree far below the abilities of men—with more apparent propriety it may be aſſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of him who roves the deſert with the leſs ſavage brute.</p>
            <p>The education of the females has been ſuch as could ſcarcely fail to debaſe the mind, and at the ſame time to inflate it with vanity. Romances generally conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute the whole of their library, which, as to improvement, are empty as the wind, they are good when kept in proper bounds but tend to engroſs the whole attention, vitiate the taſte, and render <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>he peruſer as full of ſelf-importance as though ſhe was the very character before and to whom all
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:028664_0006_0FDA3DFFB48C9F18"/>adoration and apparent devotion ſhould be paid. The ladies have had no incitement to noble undertakings—cuſtom has long declared that the cultivation of the mental powers is not their eſpecial buſineſs—a liberal education has been uniformly deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them—and when attempted, has render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them the objects of mirth and raillery— the cold hand of prejudice has cloſely ſealed every door of the temple of Fame againſt them—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> in ſpite of theſe diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, many have ſhone with ſuperior luſtre—many have proved themſelves ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of ſwaying the ſceptre of empires— many have awoke to extacy the harmoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous lyre. America can boaſt of three, unrivalled in the annals of hiſtory—Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land ſhines with a Seward, a Chapone, a Moore, and a Rowe—and France, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps never nurtured a more ſublime mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raliſt or a keener ſatireſt than her boaſted Montague.</p>
            <p>But this is not the ground, declaimers againſt ſemale excellence wiſh to tread on—they know it to be difficultly tenable —they ſneak into the corner of error—ral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly round the ſtandard of ſlander, and level their artillery with more than manly cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage at ſemale weakneſs, vices, and vani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties.
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:028664_0007_0FDA3E23931BA9A0"/>While we touch at ſome of their delightful topics, we ſhall ſpurn every thing really obſcene, and juſt remark, that in this the female character ſtands infinitely above the long catalogue of often failing yet always perſuaded debauchees. We ſhall conſider two things which are gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally the ſubjects of ſatire, and render the fair, in the eyes of our too-refined gentlemen, the objects of contempt, viz. Dreſs and Detraction. Our modern de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimers cry out, Oh dreſs, thou firſt, thou vileſt fruit of man's apoſtacy? Such a declamation really looks well coming from a gentleman who is a beau in its full extent. This is precept and exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple going hand in hand.</p>
            <p>But even ſuppoſing it were true that the ladies are more careful to furbiſh and dreſs their perſons than to improve their minds—have they not a reaſonable, nay, a juſt excuſe? Are not beauty and ſhow of wealth what every one of us worſhip: The character of a gentlemen is formed from his conduct and mental abilities—a lady's moſt frequently from her appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance—a gentleman attracts the attention of the ladi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s by his character, his station in life, his propoſal—a lady draws the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:028664_0008_0FDA3E02D1ACBC08"/>of a gentleman altogether by her beauty, joined with modeſt conduct— mental accompliſhments are not looked for in her to a great degree—a lady can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not live independent, and cuſtom ſays ſhe muſt not chooſe until ſhe be choſen—it muſt therefore be right for her to uſe thoſe means by which cuſtom ſays ſhe will moſt probably be choſen. Suppoſe a lady pays little or no attention to dreſs, reads all day, talks of Saturn's belt, Herſchel's aerology, oſteology, dioptics, and politics, who will ever be her ſuitor? So power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful are the effects of cuſtom in this, that unleſs a lady dreſſes neatly, and in ſome degree according to her ability, ſhe would attract but very few or no admirers of our ſex, and would ſigh out an exiſtence of comfortleſs celibacy.</p>
            <p>The next crime, in point of turpidity and frequency, with which the ladies have been charged, is mercileſs detraction. In this, as in dreſs, precept and example coin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide. Perhaps in this very act the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimer, by ſtigmatizing the whole ſex for the conduct of a very few, exhibits as true a ſpecimen of detraction as could poſſibly be adduced. The cup of life is ſurely ſufficiently bitter without additional
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:028664_0009_0FDA3E275737FC28"/>gall. Who but muſt execrate the wretch who poiſons enjoyment with the bane of ſcandal. The ſlanderer deſtroys all con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in friendſhip, kindles the flame of diſcord, and tranſmutes our faireſt hopes of harmonious ſociety into the direful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord of infernals. To this deteſtable vice we are all prone; it is connate with human nature; and who can affirm that the ladies with the greateſt pleaſure ſip this with their tea, and not alſo believe that the gentlemen drink it in full draughts with their grog.</p>
            <p>Sympathy is an univerſal characteriſtic of the fair—their feelings are more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, and their ſolt affections more eaſily moved; and does not this run directly counter to detraction?—Why then brand them alone with that propenſity from which their natures appear more averſe than thoſe of men: And are the ladies really more prone to this than men? Or is it merely becauſe they, for want of oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſubjects for converſation, have more frequently to talk of characters? Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men have a variety of ſubjects both public and private, which afford topics for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, of which the ladies are altogeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er deprived—the topics of their converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:028664_0010_0FDA3E2A65191DB8"/>are little more extenſive than the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle of their acquaitance. Some ladies, I muſt confeſs, are ſhamefully prone to detraction; but muſt the whole ſex be ſtigmatized for the frailties of a few: Where is the ſect, even among ſacred de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nominations, where the whole, according to this teſt of merit, might not be ſtig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matized with the moſt opprobrious epi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thets—Although my acquaintance with mankind is but ſmall, yet even in detrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as many might be choſen among men of its votaries, as amongſt the fair. Then with the ſame propriety may our ſex be branded with this, of all crimes the moſt deteſtable.</p>
            <p>I ſincerely believe the reaſon why our ſex indulge themſelves in ſuch baſe invec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive againſt the ladies, is becauſe we are conſcious that our vices in ſwearing, drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, &amp;c. of which they are clear, and which debaſe us below the level with the brute, vaſtly over-run the catalogne of fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male frailties, not only in the baſeneſs of the act, but alſo in the ſubſequent evilneſs of the conſequences; and therefore, in order to ſtrike a parallel with the other ſex, we muſt invent new vices for them— make thoſe peculiar of which we equally
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:028664_0011_0FDA3E2C97ADB8C8"/>partake—and paint ſmall ones with the brighteſt dye. Is this generous? Is it not glaring inhumanity? Does it beſpeak that candour and attachment to truth which ſhould always characterize the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mind—the man of ſenſe—the <hi>truly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fined gentleman?</hi>
