            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>THEY are the penitent Words of <hi>David,</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting upon his barbarous Murder of <hi>Uriah:</hi> A moſt earneſt Prayer to GOD to forgive his Crime, and reſtore the Peace of his Soul. You have the dreadful Story in II <hi>Sam.</hi> xi, <hi>&amp;</hi> xii, Chapters. After his great and complicated Wickedneſs, <hi>Nathan</hi> the Prophet is ſent to him with a Meſſage from GOD; a Meſſage full of Conviction, Reſentment, and Mercy. The Prophet, in the Name of GOD, charges home his Sin upon his Conſcience; <hi>Thou art the Man!</hi> He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounces the Judgments of Heaven againſt him, and againſt his Houſe. He aggravates his Wickedneſs to him, in all its Circumſtances of Darkneſs &amp; Horror, and informs him of the mighty Anger of GOD burning and raging againſt him. And now the poor King has his Heart melted within him. He has nothing to ſay in his own Excuſe. He had carried on his Impiety, with Hypocriſy, Deceit &amp; Lies: But the Spirit of GOD ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes him; He is overcome; He has no Heart to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed any further. <hi>And David ſaid unto Nathan, I have
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:006647_0004_10297434D7EB94B8"/>
ſinned againſt the Lord. And Nathan ſaid unto David, the Lord alſo hath put away thy Sin; thou ſhalt not die.</hi> Here's Penitence! Here's Mercy! The weeping <hi>David</hi> at once condemns himſelf; owns his Guilt; falls down before GOD, in Shame and Self-loathing. But Oh! How ſurprized was he to hear the Pardon pronounced, ſoon as his Repentance was declared?</p>
            <p>When <hi>Nathan</hi> left him, he retired to faſt &amp; pray for the Life of his Child: And now, a ſudden <hi>Afflatus</hi> from GOD came upon him, and inſpired he writes the Pſalm before us. The Spirit of GOD comes back again to his Soul: and tho' perhaps he intended to make a Prayer for the Recovery of his Infant, The Words are altered in his Mouth, and in his Pen; And he gives us the moſt noble Proceſs of Repentance that is any where to be met with. That Part of the Pſalm that I am upon, ſuited to the awful Occaſion of this Day, is the Addreſs of the humble Penitent to GOD, to pardon his dreadful Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der: <hi>Deliver me from Blood-guiltineſs, O GOD, thou GOD of my Salvation: and my Tongue ſhall ſing aloud of thy Righteouſneſs.</hi>— In diſcourſing on theſe Words, I ſhall in the Name of GOD, endeavour the following Things.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I ſhall deſcribe the <hi>Crime</hi> of <hi>David: Blood-Guiltineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. I ſhall conſider his <hi>Prayer: Deliver me from Blood-Guiltineſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. I ſhall ſtate the <hi>Argument of his Hopes: O GOD, thou GOD of my Salvation.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And laſtly, His <hi>grateful Reſolution</hi> in Caſe God for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gave him; <hi>My Tongue ſhall ſing aloud of thy Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I ſhall endeavour to be as brief as I can upon theſe Points, that I may haſten to that particular and ſolemn Application, which I am call'd to by the affecting Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject before us.</p>
            <p n="1">I. I am to deſcribe to you the Crime of <hi>David</hi>; ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs'd in that Word <hi>Blood-Guiltineſs.</hi> The original Word litterally tranſlated is <hi>Bloods—From Bloods.</hi> 'Twas an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved Crime, a perplex'd Piece of Villany. It had in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:006647_0005_10297437D27D3EF0"/>
it a Plurality of dark Circumſtances &amp; Murders. <hi>Bloods:</hi> There was more than one it ſeems in it. Perhaps when <hi>Uriah</hi> was ſet in the Front of the Battle, it was ſo order'd that others ſhould fall with him to diſguiſe the Buſineſs. II Sam. xi.25. <hi>Then David ſaid to the Meſſenger — The Sword devoureth one as well as another: Make the Battle ſtronger</hi> next Time. However, <hi>Joah</hi> was guilty as well as <hi>David</hi>; and it all reſted in the End upon the Head of <hi>David,</hi> who cauſed <hi>Joah</hi> to ſin. So that the Guilt of two fell upon him ſingly, and in this Reſpect, he might well ſpeak of <hi>Bloods.</hi> Beſides this, the poor innocent Infant muſt die for his Father's Sin; ſo that in ſome Sort he was the Author of his Child's Death too. But it may be <hi>David</hi> uſed the plural Number here, reflecting upon his murderous Deſigns once or twice before: For he had the Guilt in his Heart, tho' GOD with-held him from compleating the Act. — What a Madman was he in the Caſe of <hi>Nabal!</hi> 'Tis true, the Son of <hi>Belial</hi> uſed him unjuſtly and ſcurilouſly: But was that any Reaſon that he ſhould murder him, and his whole Family with him? Becauſe <hi>Nabal</hi> was a Churl, muſt <hi>David</hi> turn a revengeful, bloody Ruffian? And yet what a Speech did he make upon this Occaſion, when he heard <hi>Nabal</hi> had affronted him? He was all on Fire. 'Twas but a Word and a Blow with him. In an Inſtant he flies out in a Frenzy, curſes all his Enemies, profanes the Name of his GOD, and vows to kill <hi>Nabal</hi> and all his Family before Morning. 1 Sam. xxv.12. <hi>So David's young Men turned their Way, and went again, and came and told him all thoſe Sayings. And David ſaid unto his Men, Gird you on every Man his Sword! and they girded on every Man his Sword, and went up after David four hundred Men. And David ſaid. Surely in vain have I kept all that this Fellow hath in the Wilderneſs — And he hath requited me Evil for Good. So and more alſo do GOD unto the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of David, if I leave of all that pertain to him by the Morning Light, even ſo much as a Dog.</hi> And did you ever hear ſuch Language as this from the Mouth of any
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:006647_0006_1029743AD9983730"/>
but a bloody-minded Madman? And tho' a good GOD prevented the Execution of this raſh Vow, who can ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe <hi>David</hi> from having Murder in his Heart? Well then might <hi>David</hi> in his Penitence, reflect upon more Murders than one, and pray to be delivered from <hi>Bloods.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But to confine our Selves to this particular Crime, and if you pleaſe, to keep to the Engliſh Tranſlation, <hi>Blood-guiltineſs:</hi> O what a Scene of Impiety opens to our View! 'Tis one of the moſt diſmal Hiſtories in all the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. The ſtrangeſt Inſtance of a Fall from GOD that was ever before known. <hi>David,</hi> a poor unregardable little Shepherd, choſen by the peculiar Grace of GOD, diſtinguiſhed from, and advanced above all his goodly elder Brethren, preſerved by a conſtant Series of Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, raiſed to the Throne of the peculiar People of GOD, ſurrounded by all the Bleſſings of Earth and Heaven; inſpired by the vaſt Poſſeſſion of the Holy Spirit; and in one Word, declared to be, <hi>The Man after GOD's own Heart.</hi> This <hi>David</hi> now; (would you think it!) This very <hi>David,</hi> falls into Adultery and Murder. The leaſt Sin, had in him been great, who was under ſo many Obligations to GOD: But Adultery &amp; Murder! What could a Heathen, or an Athieſt do worſe?</p>
            <p>And yet this is the very Caſe before us. <hi>David,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der all his indiſſoluble Obligations, and matchleſs. Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages, thus fouly falls, an eternal Reproach to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Nature, and an Inſtance what frail Creatures we are, even the beſt Men upon Earth.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>David</hi> then goes up to the Battlements of his Palace, and there walks idly from Side to Side; and having no Buſineſs to employ him, falls a Prey to the Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of Coveteouſneſs and Luſt. Happy had it been for thee, <hi>David,</hi> hadſt thou now been employed in the Affairs of the Kingdom, or in thy Retirements addreſs'd a Pſalm to Heaven. But he was idle! And O what an Inlet is this curſed Vice to all Miſchief &amp; Wickedneſs? Being idle he ſtood as it were a Man in the Devil's Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket Place, waiting to be ſet to Work. Here <hi>Satan</hi> found him out of God's Way; and this which appears to many
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006647_0007_1029743C5F4E4840"/>
ſo little a Sin, lead the Way to all the Exceſs and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs following. He was tempted and he fell. The generous <hi>Uriah</hi> was now in the bloody Field, fight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Battels of the Lord, &amp; maintaining the Honour of this <hi>David</hi>; while he baſely betrayed his Wife. Afraid the Matter ſhould be diſcovered, he uſes the meaneſt Artifices, and the vileſt Hypocriſy to cover his Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: But when he found none of his baſe Schemes took Effect, then (wonder O Heavens, and be aſtoniſhed O Earth, be ye horribly afraid, and be ye very deſolate!) then he conſpires the Death of <hi>Uriah,</hi> one of his braveſt and moſt gallant Friends. He who merited to be rank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the thirty Worthies, muſt be ranked in the Fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front of the Battel, that he may be numbred to the Sword of the Enemy. Was ever any Thing more treacherous and perfideous! The vile Conſpiracy took Effect, and the brave <hi>Uriah</hi> falls a Victim to the Cruelty and Luſt of <hi>David.</hi> The <hi>Adultery</hi> was deteſtible; But nothing could be more barbarous and curſed than the <hi>Murder.</hi> Conſider the Criminal, the Manner, and the Subject, and <hi>there was no ſuch Deed done nor ſeen from the Day that the Children of Iſrael came out of the Land of Egypt, unto this Day: Conſider of it, confer together, and ſpeak your Minds.</hi> How often muſt <hi>David</hi>'s Conſcience check him, while he was conſpiring this Wickedneſs? How many Reluctings muſt he needs have within? And yet, deliberately, and bearing down all, he compleats the Guilt, and the gallant Hero bleeds a Sacrifice to his lewd Deſires.</p>
            <p>Now <hi>David</hi> began to make himſelf eaſy. The Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der was committed, and he thought that it would be concealed: There could never be any Proof of the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and he fancied himſelf ſecure. But Oh, poor Man, thy GOD, and thy Conſcience know the Affair, and in vain wouldſt thou diſguiſe it from the World, while the Guilt and the Anguiſh corrodes within. Alas! there are no more quiet Hours for <hi>David.</hi> His Heart ſmites him, his GOD withdraws, the Ghoſt of the murdered
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:006647_0008_1029743FB18B0778"/>
               <hi>Uriah</hi> haunts his Dreams, and perplexes his waking Hours. He turns pale and ſtarts at every Noiſe, and hears the Blood cry from the Ground, for Vengeance to the GOD of Heaven. He who a few Nights ago could fall aſleep in the Raptures of his Maſter's Love, now has no Reſt in his Bones becauſe of his Sin. He who was wont to remember his GOD with Joy upon his Bed, now waters his Couch with his Tears. The Anguiſh of his Mind was inſupportable long before <hi>Nathan</hi> was ſent from GOD to him. He quickly begun to repent after the Fact was over.</p>
            <p>I know 'tis the general Opinion, that <hi>David</hi> lived in his Sin, for ſeveral Months, and was never brought to Repentance 'till this Viſit from <hi>Nathan.</hi> But, with all Submiſſion, I think the Caſe was much otherwiſe. It appears as tho' ſeveral Paſſages of the penitential Pſalms were written after the Murder of <hi>Uriah,</hi> and before <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>than</hi> had ſaid, <hi>The Lord alſo hath put away thy Sin.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. 6.32.38.51.102.130.143.</note> Would <hi>David,</hi> do you imagine, have written in ſuch diſponding Terms, after God himſelf had aſſur'd him that he was pardoned? No: tho' this Pſalm wherein is my Text, was written after <hi>Nathan's</hi> Meſſage, yet it ſhould ſeem from the different Air, that other of the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitential Pſalms were compoſed in the Depth of Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, before <hi>David</hi> could perſwade himſelf that GOD had forgiven him.</p>
            <p>See the poor King in his dark Retirements! Adultery and Murder lay upon his Soul. He complains of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quietude, Wounds, and broken Bones. He weeps and rores with inward Diſtreſs. His Tears are his Meat Night and Day, and he finds no Relief as yet from GOD or Man. However, his Penitence is ſincere, tho' he ſees it not. He would not commit the Wickedneſs again for a thouſand Worlds. As yet, the C<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="5 letters">

               </gap> was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed from the World, and as GOD had conceal'd it, he had no need to blaze it abroad. But however, he is brought into this ſubmiſſive Temper, as every true Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:006647_0009_10297442B6AFC950"/>
is, if ever Providence ſhould bring it out, his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance ſhould be as publick as his Sin. This is the true Diſpoſition of a ſincere Convert. And now the fulneſs of Time was come for a merciful GOD to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard his Diſtreſs, and ſend the Words of Pardon to him. The Prophet comes at the divine Order, and charges his Guilt home upon him, <hi>Thou art the Man!</hi> At once <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid</hi> confeſſes without Heſitation or Reluctance. He burſts into Tears, and cries out, <hi>I have ſinned againſt the Lord.</hi> Now you ſee <hi>David</hi> again. He appears like his former Self. Full of Faith, and Love, and Prayer, and Grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, he returns to his GOD, and riſes in all his Glory. <hi>Nathan</hi> goes away, and <hi>David</hi> retires to Faſting and Prayer, to aſk the Life of his unlawful Child. But GOD meets him in the miraculous Inſpiration, and he forgets his own particular Requeſt, and writes this penitential Pſalm, for the Benefit of the Church in all future Ages.</p>
            <p>We have thus conſidered the Crime of <hi>David,</hi> and how vaſt was it! How dreadful in <hi>itſelf,</hi> and how aggravated in <hi>him!</hi> And yet, hoping in GOD, he makes this Prayer, <hi>Deliver me from Blood-guiltineſs, O GOD, thou GOD of my Salvation: and my Tongue ſhall ſing aloud of thy Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> And this is the ſecond Thing to be conſidered.</p>
            <p n="2">II. I am to obſerve upon the <hi>Prayer</hi> of <hi>David,</hi> with Regard to his dreadful Sin. He <hi>prays</hi>; and 'twas the beſt Thing he could do. The wiſeſt Courſe we can take after we have fallen into Sin, is at once to pray for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance. If ever <hi>Satan</hi> can keep us from praying, he has us faſt enough. If <hi>David</hi> had reſtrained Prayer, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his Sin, what had become of him then indeed! then he had been ruined without Hope. But he prayed to his GOD: and what ſaid he: <hi>Deliver me from Blood-guiltineſs, O GOD, thou GOD of my Salvation &amp;c.</hi> Deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me from it. Happy had it been for <hi>David,</hi> had he made this Prayer, when he was firſt tempted to it. But now 'tis paſt, he is convinced, that if GOD will pleaſe to forgive him, he may yet be delivered. The Man who is pardoned, is in the Sight of GOD, as pure as he who never ſinned.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:006647_0010_10297448AA4BC240"/>III. You obſerve the <hi>Argument</hi> which <hi>David</hi> makes uſe of in his Plea for a Pardon. <hi>O GOD, thou GOD of my Salvation.</hi>— Paſt Experiences are Arguments for future Favours.—The Name of GOD is his ſtrong Tower, to which he flies for Protection. His Name is the GOD of Salvation: Wherefore, for his Name's Sake, <hi>David</hi> urges for a Pardon. <hi>Thou GOD of my Salvation:</hi> 'Tis as if he had ſaid, <hi>Thou GOD my SAVIOUR.</hi> This was the Name for the MESSIAH. And under that dark Diſpenſation, 'twas as tho' he had ſaid, <hi>For CHRIST's Sake.</hi> And thus are we to ſeek Pardon from GOD. Not for the Sake of our own Prayers and Tears, and good Works: But only on the Account of our Saviour's Merits: <hi>O GOD, thou GOD of my Salvation.</hi> Of his own Mercy he ſaved us. Eph. ii.8. <hi>For by Grace are ye ſaved, thro' Faith, &amp; that not of your ſelves: it is the Gift of GOD.</hi> 'Tis a fatal Miſtake, to pray for a Pardon, and think we ſhall obtain it for the Sake of the Prayer. Or if we endeavour to repent of Sin, &amp; reform our Lives, it overſets the whole Work, if we depend upon this Repentance and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation, and not on GOD our Saviour. Rom. x.3, 4. <hi>For they being ignorant of GOD's Righteouſneſs, and going about to eſtabliſh their own Righteouſneſs, have not ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted themſelves unto the Righteouſneſs of GOD. For CHRIST is the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that believeth.</hi> Our whole Argument for a Pardon then, muſt be, <hi>O GOD, Thou GOD of my Salvation.</hi> We muſt depend upon the Mercies of GOD, and the Merits of our Saviour, for Pardon, and Acceptance, and Reconciliation. After all the vile Crime of <hi>David,</hi> he could make this his Confidence, and take Sanctuary here. There's no Sinner ſo great, but here's enough for him, upon his ſincere return.</p>
            <p>The laſt Thing I obſerv'd in the Text, was</p>
            <p n="4">IV. <hi>David's grateful Reſolution</hi> in Caſe GOD forgave him; and the bleſſed <hi>Effect</hi> of pardoning Mercy. <hi>My Tongue ſhall ſing aloud of thy Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Says the Penitent <hi>David,</hi> I am under the Guilt of Bloods—But O my GOD forgive me, and my Tongue
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006647_0011_1029744A30038100"/>
ſhall ſing aloud of thy Righteouſneſs. Praiſe &amp; Thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving are the immediate Practice of every pardoned Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner. O when a poor Creature has been ſhaken over the Mouth of Hell, and then ſees himſelf delivered, he is ſwallowed up in the Love of GOD, and burns with the moſt lively Gratitude to him. O, ſays he, what has my GOD done for me! and what ſhall I render to him! Thou GOD of my Salvation, how can I praiſe thee enough! Never can I requite thee; but how ſhall I teſtify the Sincerity and Ardors of my Love!</p>
            <p>But in the original Text, the Particle <hi>And</hi> is omitted. It runs, <hi>Deliver me from Bloods, O GOD, Thou GOD of my Salvation;—My Tongue ſhall ſing aloud of thy Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.</hi> This expreſſes the Aſſurance the Pſalmiſt had, that GOD <hi>had</hi> heard him, and the Joy of Pardon was breaking in. It teaches us, that where-ever true Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is, there is certainly Forgiveneſs. The <hi>Engliſh Tranſlation</hi> expreſſes the <hi>grateful Reſentment</hi> of a <hi>Pardon:</hi> the <hi>original Hebrew</hi> declares, the <hi>certain Effect</hi> of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> prays to be delivered, he ſtops ſhort and ſays inward, <hi>I am ſo</hi>: My Tongue <hi>ſhall</hi> ſing aloud of thy Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>You obſerve; If we are pardon'd 'tis becauſe of the Righteouſneſs of GOD our Saviour. This muſt be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to us, if ever we are forgiven by GOD. If after all our Sins, we are again received into Favour, we muſt not attribute it to our own Merits, but ſing aloud of his Righteouſneſs.</p>
            <p>You obſerve, That it is an Act of Juſtice in GOD to forgive the believing Penitent. CHRIST, in a Word, has paid the full Price of a Pardon for all that repent and believe. 'Tis then a Debt upon GOD's giving us Faith and Repentance: GOD is Righteous when he receives us upon our Repentance and Faith. He may be juſt, and yet juſtify him that believeth. 'Tis a great Word, and if GOD had not ſaid it himſelf, we ſhould not have dar'd to; I Joh. i.9. <hi>If we confeſs our Sins, he is Faithful and Juſt to forgive us our Sins, and to cleanſe us from all Unrighteouſneſs.</hi> Convinced of this, <hi>David</hi> aſſur'd
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:006647_0012_1029744BC1317738"/>
of the divine Pardon, prepares to ſing aloud of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs of GOD, which firſt purchaſed, and then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed it.</p>
            <p>I have now gone thro' the ſeveral Points of Doctrine which I intended, and am arriv'd to my Application.</p>
            <p n="1">I. From what has been ſaid, you ſee into what dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Sins human Nature may fall; even the beſt of Men, a <hi>David</hi> himſelf, off his Guard, and looſing his Hold of God, falls into Adultery, Perſidy, Ingratitude, Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criſy and Murder! O what Cauſe have we to walk cautiouſly and humbly with our God.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Let none venture to Sin from the Example of <hi>David.</hi> Would any ſeek to juſtify or excuſe their own Wickedneſs from this diſmal Hiſtory? Do they ſay, <hi>David</hi> did as bad as we can? Vain Men, is <hi>David</hi> to be imitated or no? If he is, why do you not follow him in his Repentance, his Devotion, his ſteady and long continued Courſe of Holineſs, as well as in one Act which he himſelf pronounced deteſtable. So that, thou Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, out of thy own Mouth ſhalt thou be condemned. But if you ſay he is not to be imitated, then pray never mention his Name to paliate or ſoften thy own Crimes.—'Twas one of the greateſt Agravations of his Sin, that it <hi>gave Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to the Enemies of the Lord to Blaſpheme.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">III. Let none applaud his own Innocence, when he compares himſelf with the Falls of <hi>David.</hi> Say not, how pure am I, who never committed ſuch enormous Crimes? The Law ſays, <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill, thou ſhalt not commit Adultery.</hi> Say not, <hi>Theſe have I kept from my Youth.</hi> 'Twas the proud <hi>Phariſee</hi> who utter'd the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane Boaſt, <hi>God I thank thee that I am not as other Men are, Extortioners, Unjust, Adulterers, or even as this Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lican.</hi> Nay, let him that thinketh he ſtandeth, take Heed leaſt he fall. Whilſt I have been Preaching of Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery &amp; Murder, let not the bigger Part of the Audience think that they have little to do with it. Alas, in this vile Heart of mine, are the Seeds of all theſe blackeſt Sins. So ſaid the bleſſed Martyr <hi>Bradford,</hi> ſtriking
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:006647_0013_1029744EC74A45A0"/>
on his Breaſt; when he heard of the great Sins of others. If God ſhould leave us to ourſelves, there's no Sin ſo vile but the very beſt of us would preſently com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit. Nay, who can pronounce himſelf clear, when the LORD JESUS CHRIST himſelf, that beſt Expoſiter of the divine Law, has poſitively declared, <hi>Whoſoever is angry at his Brother without a Cauſe</hi> is a <hi>Murderer: Whoſoever looks with irregular Deſire</hi> is an <hi>Adulterer.</hi> Matth. v.21, 27. Nay, in the Name of God, I indict every impenitent Sinner in this great Aſſembly, of Murder, moſt execrable Murder! You have your Share in the Guilt that has murdered all Mankind. For <hi>as by one Man Sin enter'd into the World, and Death by Sin, ſo has Death paſſed upon all Men, in that all have ſinned.</hi> More than this, every Time you have committed a Sin, you have given a deadly Stab to your ruin'd Spirits. He that doth it, deſtroyeth his own Soul. When you have been about to commit Sin, how have you once and again felt your Heart miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give, your Conſcience ſmite you. You were that Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment going to kill your Souls: And had you attended, you had heard them cry out, MURDER! And yet, you have ſtop'd your Ears to their bitter Shreeks, and have gone on, 'till now perhaps they are wholly dead, quite inſenſible, and the Spirit of GOD may never work upon them any more. But what ſay you to that Indictment of the Apoſtle, Heb. vi.6. <hi>If they ſhall fall away, it is impoſſible to renew them again unto Repentance: ſeeing they crucify to themſelves the Son of GOD afreſh, and put him to open Shame.</hi> Or what ſhall the profane Approacher to the Lord's Table ſay to that Indictment, <hi>He is guilty of the Body and Blood of the Lord.</hi> To every impenitent Sinner, who ſhall aſk, What has a Sermon to a Murderer to do with me? I tell him, as the Prophet from GOD to <hi>David, Thou art the Man.</hi> The Blood of your mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered Souls cries to Heaven againſt you. Againſt thy own Life haſt thou done this Thing! All of us then have need enough to make the Prayer of my Text, <hi>Deliver me from Blood-guiltineſs, O GOD, Thou GOD of my Salvation &amp;c.</hi>—</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:006647_0014_1029745332EA6C80"/>But, I come now to the more particular Application of the Day; and addreſs the Word of GOD to the poor Malefactor before us in the Terrors of the Shadow of Death.</p>
            <p>Ah! poor Daughter of Death, Hear what Meſſages I bring you from Heaven, and GOD give you Faith in the Hearing.</p>
            <p>Poor Criminal, here you ſtand condemned before GOD; within a few Moments of Death and Eternity. Need I ſay any Thing to excite <hi>your</hi> Attention to the Admonitions of Heaven. <hi>You</hi> are too nearly concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be a ſleepy Hearer. I ſhall ſpeak to you, as to One juſt launching into the inviſible World, with the utmoſt Fidelity to GOD, my own Soul, and yours.</p>
            <p>This is not a Time to give flattering Words, but as far as I can, firſt to convince, to affect, to awaken you; and then to ſhew you the right Way to a Pardon, and encourage you to <hi>lay hold</hi> on it.</p>
            <p>Ah, unhappy Malefactor! The Voice of the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent Blood cries aloud from the Ground to Heaven. In many Regards my Text is ſuited to you, and your Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances are like <hi>David's.</hi> GOD has bleſs'd you with a religious Education. Like <hi>David</hi> you have been diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed among your Nation by peculiar Favours of GOD.</p>
            <p>And now, what Improvement did you make of your Advantages? What Returns did you make to the good GOD that diſtinguiſhed you? You are ready in ſome Sort to own how diſobedient &amp; falſe &amp; miſchievous you have been. GOD gave you a Space to repent, and tried you from Day to Day: But you repented not; you were hard and incorrigible. GOD provok'd, left you: and you ſee what is come of it: Young as you are, ripe for the Vengeance of a capital Execution! However, He was good to you ſtill: and in your long Confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in Darkneſs &amp; Solitude, he has given you Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to ſeek his Favour; and GOD knows how miſerably you have improved them.</p>
            <p>But, O poor Malefactor, I would not drive you to Deſpair. I bring you good Tydings of great Joy, unto
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:006647_0015_102974564F7D8BB0"/>
you is offer'd a Saviour; Pardon and Life &amp; Salvation. You know what the Law of GOD ſays expreſly, Exod. xx.13. <hi>Thou ſhalt not kill.</hi> You have read what awful Words GOD ſpake to <hi>Noah,</hi> Gen. ix.5, 6. <hi>Surely your Blood of your Lives will I require: at the Hand of every Man's Brother will I require the Life of Man. Whoſo ſhed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth Man's Blood, by Man ſhall his Blood be ſhed.</hi> You have been told of that unalterable Sentence of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, Numb. xxxv.16. <hi>If he ſmite him (ſo that he die) he is a Murderer: the Murderer ſhall ſurely be put to Death.</hi> Here, in the Word of GOD, you read your Crime and your Puniſhment. It would be a Sin in any ſo much as to wiſh for your Life, Prov. xxviii.17. <hi>A Man that doth Violence to the Blood of any Perſon, ſhall flee to the Pit, let no Man ſtay him.</hi> Numb. xxxv.31. <hi>Moreover, ye ſhall take no Satisfaction for the Life of a Murderer, which is guilty of Death: but he ſhall, be ſurely put to Death.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But tho' you have loſt your Life for this World, there is yet ſome Hope remaining that you may obtain a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. Indeed they are dreadful Words, I Joh. iii.15. <hi>No Murderer hath eternal Life.</hi> 'Tis a dreadful Deſcription, Rev. xxii.15. Shut out of the holy City, <hi>are Dogs, and Whoremongers, and Murderers, and whoſoever loveth and maketh a Lie.</hi> 'Tis a dreadful Declaration, Gal. v.19, 21. <hi>The Works of the Fleſh are theſe, Adultery, Fornication, Uncleanneſs, Murders, Drunkenneſs — They that do ſuch Things ſhall not inherit the Kingdom of GOD.</hi> 'Tis a dreadful Account, Rev. xxi.8. <hi>The Unbelieving, and the Abominable, and Murderers, and Whoremongers, and all Liars, ſhall have their Part in the Lake which burneth with Fire and Brimſtone; which is the ſecond Death.</hi> This, miſerable Creature, muſt be your certain Doom, if after all, you die impenient. You have fallen into the Hands of Men, and they have condemned you as not fit to live: But O you'l find it a fearful Thing to fall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Hands of the living GOD.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:006647_0016_1029745965150AC0"/>But yet, after all theſe dreadful Words, I am here, in the Name of CHRIST, to make you another Offer of a Pardon. Like <hi>Nathan,</hi> I would firſt convict you: And then, like him, I am to inform you of the Mercies of GOD, and the Hopes of Forgiveneſs. You muſt be in Agony, but you may not Deſpair. Tho' Murder is ſuch a flagrant Crime, and the Word of GOD ſpeaks ſo terribly of it, yet, 'tis no more than what you ſee <hi>David</hi> has been pardon'd for before. So was <hi>Manaſſeh,</hi> who is now in Glory, after all his Wickedneſs &amp; Murders. He ſhed innocent Blood very much, which the Lord would not pardon, ſo as not to puniſh it in this World: No more did he <hi>David's</hi> Murder, but for ever after this was he purſu'd by one Affliction after another, 'till he died: But yet <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> are both now in Paradiſe, bleſſing and admiring the Grace of GOD together: You, poor Criminal, may in a few Hours be with them.</p>
            <p>'Twas long before <hi>Manaſſeh</hi> repented. Not 'till he was bound with Fetters, and held in Cords of Affliction: II Chron. xxxiii.11. <hi>And when he was in Affliction he beſought the Lord his God, and humbled himſelf greatly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the God of his Fathers, and prayed unto him, and he was entreated of him, and heard his Supplication: Then</hi> Manaſſeh <hi>knew that the Lord he is God.</hi> Nay, what Incouragement would you deſire, diſconſolate Priſoner! The very Men who murdered the Son of God, were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned and are now in Heaven. See <hi>Act.</hi> ii.23.36 —41.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, the innocent Blood cries from the Ground for Vengeance: But yet, the Blood of Sprinkling ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth better Things than the Bood of <hi>Abel,</hi> and this lifts up a prevailing Cry for Pardon &amp; Forgiveneſs for you. When the frightned Jailour was going to Murder <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,</hi> and cried out, trembling, <hi>What ſhall I do to be ſaved?</hi> The Apoſtle anſwered him, <hi>Act.</hi> xvi.31. <hi>Believe on the LORD JESUS CHRIST, and thou ſhalt be ſaved.</hi> So I ſay to you, Priſoner of Death. I ſhall explain your Duty in this Thing, and ſo conclude my Diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:006647_0017_1029745B011538C0"/>Spend ſome of your few Moments in calling to Mind your Sins, in their ſeveral Argravations, and confeſs them as particularly as you can to GOD. He that covereth his Tranſgreſſion ſhall not proſper: But he that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſeth and forſaketh <hi>ſhall find Mercy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As you ſee yourſelf thus ruin'd on all Hands, now betake yourſelf to GOD in CHRIST. Here, poor Cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, here's Mercy and plentious Redemption for you. Here's Pardon and Righteouſneſs, Sanctification &amp; eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life. Say, O GOD, thou GOD of my Salvation, for thy Names Sake, and for thy Son's Sake, forgive me, and renew me. Submit to GOD your Saviour, and chuſe and truſt in the bleſſed JESUS, as your Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, Prieſt and King. Renounce your own Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and depend upon his. Say, <hi>Tho' he ſlay me, yet will I truſt in him.</hi> If God enables you to be ſincere and thorough in this, there ſhall after all be Joy in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven over you. The Prodigal returning ſhall be met and embraced by the tender Father.</p>
            <p>And now let your Tongue ſing aloud of his Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs. Plead the Righteouſneſs of your Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our for your Juſtification; praiſe and admire this: Adore the Righteouſneſs of GOD, who gives you up for this World; but offers you a Pardon for the next. Juſtify God, and condemn yourſelf. Submit and reſign, and fall down before this ſovereign and juſt GOD. Thus ſpend the few Moments of your Life here, and if GOD ſhould indeed give you ſuch a Heart, in that Hour when you leave this World, the LORD JESUS CHRIST who himſelf ſuffered without the Gates, ſhall ſay to you, as once to the Malefactor at his Execution. <hi>To Day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I now turn me to this very great Congregation: And Oh! Let the chief of Sinners here before GOD, hence learn their Duty, and take Warning. Flee in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly from the Wrath to come, the Evil which purſue Sinners.</p>
