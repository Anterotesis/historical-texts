            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>A Few days after the archbiſhop of Paris and his vicars had ſet the example of renouncing their clerical character, a rector, from a village on the banks of the Rhone, followed by ſome of his pariſhioners, with an of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering of gold and ſilver ſaints, chali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, rich veſtments, &amp;c. preſented himſelf at the bar of the convention.</p>
               <p>The rector, a thin venerable man, with grey hairs, was ordered to ſpeak.</p>
               <p>I come, ſaid he, from the village of ******, where the only good build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtanding is a very fine church.—My pariſhioners beg you will take it, to make an hoſpital for <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

wounded of both parties, they being both equally our countrymen. The gold and ſilver part of which we have brought to you, they intreat you will devote to the ſervice of the ſtate, and that you will caſt the bells into cannon to drive its foreign invaders. For myſelf, I am come, with great pleaſ-uſe to reſign my letters of ordination, of induction, and every deed and ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle by which I have been conſtituted a member of your eccleſiaſtical polity. Here are the papers; you may burn them if you pleaſe, in the ſame fire with the genealogical trees and patents of nobility. I deſire, likewiſe, that you will diſcontinue my ſalary. I am ſtill able to ſupport myſelf by the labour of my hands; and I beg you to believe that I never felt ſincerer joy than I now do in making this renuncia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I have longed to ſee this day; I ſee it, and am glad.</p>
               <p>When the old man had done ſpeak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the applauſes were immoderate. The rector did not ſeem greatly elated with thoſe tokens of approbation; he retired back a few ſteps, and thus re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed his diſcourſe.</p>

                  </gap> with your own. I rejoice in this day not becauſe I wiſh to ſee religion degraded, but, becauſe I wiſh to ſee it exalted and purified.</p>
               <p>By diſſolving its alliance with the ſtate, you have given it dignity and inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence. You have done it a piece of ſervice—a service which its well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſhers would perhaps never have had courage to render it, but which is the only thing it wanted to make it appear in its genuine beauty and luſtre.</p>
               <p>Nobody will now ſay of me, when I am performing the offices of my religion, it is a trade; he is paid for telling the people ſuch and ſuch things; he is hired to keep up a uſeful piece of mum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery. They cannot now ſay this,? and therefore I feel myſelf raiſed in my own eſteem, and ſhall ſpeak to them with a confidence and frankneſs, which, before this, I never durſt ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to aſſume.</p>
               <p>We reſign without reluctance our gold and ſilver images and embroider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed veſtments, because we have never
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:030546_0006_0FE7BA97ECDD0FC8"/>
found that looking upon gold and ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver made the heart more pure, or the affections more heavenly; we can alſo ſpare our churches, for the heart that wiſhes to liſt itſelf up to God will never be at a loſs for a place to do it in; but we cannot ſpare religion, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, to tell you the truth, we never had to much occaſion for it.</p>
               <p>I underſtand that you accuſe us prieſts of having told the people a great many falſehoods. I ſuſpect this may have been the care, but till this day we have never been allowed to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether the things which we taught them were true or not. I cannot but hope, however, that the errors we have fallen into have not been very material, ſince the village has in general been ſober and good; the peaſants are honeſt, docile, and laborious; the huſbands love their wives, and the wives their huſbands; they are fortunately not too rich to be compaſſionate, and they have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly relieved the ſick and fugitives of all parties whenever it has been in their way. I think, therefore, what I have taught them cannot be ſo very amiſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="unknown:030546_0007_0FE7BA98F89BE5C8"/>
You want to extirpate prieſts, but will you hinder the ignorant from ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying for inſtruction, the unhappy for comfort and hope, the unlearned from looking up to the learned? If you do not, you will have prieſts, by whatever name you may order them to be called; but it is certainly not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary they ſhould wear a particular dreſs, or be appointed by ſtate letters of ordination. My letters of ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are my zeal, my charity, my ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent love for my dear children of the village: If I were more learned I would add my knowledge, but alas! we all know very little; to a man ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery error is pardonable but want of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility. We have a public walk, with a ſpreading elm-tree at one end of it, and a circle of green round it, with a convenient bench. Here I ſhall draw together the children as they are playing around me. I ſhall point to the vines laden with fruit, to the orchards, to the herds of cattle lowing around us, to the diſtant hills ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one behind another, and they will aſk me, how came all theſe things? I ſhall tell them all I know, or all that
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:030546_0008_0FE7BA9C176C8560"/>
I have heard from the wiſe men who have lived before me; they will be penetrated with love and veneration; they will kneel and I ſhall kneel with them; they will not be at my feet, but all of us at the feet of that Good Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whom we ſhall worſhip together, and thus they will receive into their render minds a religion.</p>
               <p>The old men will ſometimes come, from having depoſited under the green ſod one of their companions, and place themſelves by my ſide. They will look wiſhfully at the turf, and anxiouſly enquire is he gone forever? ſhall we ſoon be like him? will no morning break over the tomb? when the wicked ceaſe from troubling will the good ceaſe from doing good? We will talk of theſe things, I will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort them.—I will tell them of the goodneſs of God, I will ſpeak to them of a life to come; I will bid them hope for a ſtate of retribution.</p>
               <p>You have changed our holydays;—you have an undoubted right, as our civil governors ſo to do; it is very im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>material whether they are kept once in ſeven days or once in ten: ſome,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030546_0009_0FE7BA9D21B929D8"/>
however, you leave us, and when they occur, I ſhall tell thoſe who chuſe to hear me, of the beauty and utility of virtue, of the dignity of right conduct.</p>
               <p>There is a book out of which I have ſometimes taught my people; It ſays, we are to love thoſe who do us hurt, and to pour oil and wine into the wounds of the ſtranger. In this book we read of a perſon called Jeſus;—ſome worſhip him as God: others, as I am told, ſay it is wrong ſo to do:—ſome teach that he exiſted before the beginning of ages, others, that he was born of Joſeph and Mary.</p>
               <p>I cannot tell whether theſe contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſies will be ever decided; but in the mean time, I think we cannot do otherwiſe than well in imitating him, for I learn that he loved the poor, and went about doing good.</p>

               <head>THE NEGRO</head>
               <p>"Alas I am ſaint and feeble," ſaid a voice which miſery ſeemed to have rendered almoſt inarticulate. They were the words of a poor negro, who, oppreſſed by the heat of the ſun, (for
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:030546_0010_0FE7BAA039D73488"/>
the day was hot and ſultry) in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guid poſture, was enjoying a ſhort reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pite from his labors. "Curſe on Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ropean avarice that deals in cargoes of wretchedneſs, and thrives by the traffic of deſpair," I exclaimed the very mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment my imagination caught the picture. "Perhaps," ſaid I, "this child of ſorrow has been torn from a father—a mother." Nature muſt have pleaded very loudly againſt his captivity; for I thought I could perceive the tears of affection ſtanding in his eyes, "Or, perhaps, he has looked forward, with eager expectation, to the days he ſeemed deſtined to paſs with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of his youth; and now"—I thought on thee, Eliza, the partner of my life, and I endeavored to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert my thought from the gloomy read they were purſuing; but in vain. My captive ſpoke ſtill louder.</p>
               <p>"I once was happy," ſaid he, "When I lived beyond theſe great waters, I heard not the yells of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair; the gale rung not with the ſhrieks of the wretched. Our but was in a cool valley, beneath the ſhade of the loſty palm trees. My labours

then were ſweet, for I feared neither ſtripes nor maſter. My work in the fields provided my father with food, and he repaid with ſmiles the toil of his ſons. All was joy, all was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure. Strong and cheerful, I hailed the breezes of the morning; at noon I bathed in the ſtream, and in the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning joined the happy dance in the meadow. But now—"I loved, alas! the beauteous Yoncha, She was the theme of every ſong, the envy of ſurrounding virgins. For her <hi>I</hi> ſought and made two heroes bow at my feet. The maid of my heart trembled for my ſafety, and hailed my victory with the ſmiles of rapture. I brought her the cluſtered bannanas. From my hand, ſhe ſaid they were more luſcious. For her I climed the airy cocoanut tree, and threw into her lap the milky fruit. In the chaſe, ſhe nerved my arm with ſtrength and inſpired, my breaſt with courage.—Then I ſmiled on danger; <hi>I</hi> heeded not death. <hi>I</hi> attacked the indignant foe in his den. Though his eyes gliſtened with anger. <hi>I</hi> pierced him and he bled for Youcha. <hi>I</hi> carried home the ſpoils of the battle,

and placed them in her bower.—But now, alas! ſhe bleeds for her loſt warrior. She hears not his groans. He pines in ſlavery, he lingers for the ſtroke of death. Ah, me? the deep ocean divides us—Methinks the breezes that play on the ſurface of the waters, might waft her a ſigh or a prayer. <hi>I</hi> have often aſked them, but they ſeem not to regard me.</p>
               <p>"We were dancing on the green in the evening, and we dreaded not the hour of danger.

Orto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grul mingled with the attendants, and being ſuppoſed to have ſome buſineſs for the viſier was permited to enter. He ſurveyed the ſpaciouſneſs of the apartments, admired the walls hung with golden tapeſtry, and the floors covered with ſilken carpets, and deſpiſed the ſimple neatneſs of his own little habitation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Surely ſaid he to himſelf this palace is the ſeat of happineſs, where pleaſure ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds to pleaſure, and diſcontent and ſorrow can have no admiſſion. Whatever nature has provided for the delight of ſenſe is here ſpread forth to be enjoyed,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:030546_0014_0FE7BAA88FE6A208"/>
what can mortal wiſh or imagine which the maſter of this palace has not obtained? The diſhes of luxury cover his table, the voice of harmony lulls him in his bowers: he breathes the fragrance of the groves of java, and ſleeps upon the down of the cygnets of Ganges. He ſpeaks, and his mandate is obeyed; he wiſhes and his wiſh is gratified; all whom he ſees obey him, all whom he hears flatters him. How different, Ortogrul is thy condition, who art doomed to the perpetual torment of unſatisfied deſire, and who haſt no amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in thy power that can withhold thee from thy own conviction. They tell thee that thou art wiſe, but what does wiſdom avail with poverty? None will flatter the poor, and the wiſe have very little power of flattering themſelves. That man is ſurely the moſt wretched of the ſons of wretchedneſs who lives with his own faults and follies always before him, and who has none to reconcile him to himſelf by praiſe and veneration. I have long ſought content and have not found it; I will from this moment endeavour to be rich.</hi>

               <p>
                  <hi>Full of his new reſolution, he ſhut himſelf in his chamber for ſix months, to deliberate how he ſhould grow rich: he ſometimes propoſed to offer himſelf as
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:030546_0015_0FE7BAA99B0E3D30"/>
counſellor to one of the kings of India, and ſometimes reſolved to dig for diamonds in the mines of Golconda. One day after ſome hours paſſed in violent fluctuation of opinion, ſleep inſenſibly ſeized him in his chair: he dreamed that he was ranging a deſart country in ſearch of ſome one that might teach him to grow rich; and as he ſtood on a hill ſhaded with cypreſs, in doubt whither to direct his ſteps, his father appeared on a ſudden, ſtanding before him. Ortogrul, ſaid the old man, I know thy perplexity, liſten to thy father. Caſt thine eye on the oppoſite mountain. Orto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grul looked and ſaw a torrent tumbling down the rocks roaring with the noiſe of thunder, and ſcattering its foam on the impending woods. Now, ſaid his father, look upon the valley that lies between the hills. Ortogrul looked, and eſpied a well out of which iſſued a ſmall rivulet. Tell me now, ſaid his father, doſt thou wiſh for ſudden affluence, that may pour upon thee like the mountain torrent, or for a ſlow and gradual increaſe, reſembling the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:030546_0016_0FE7BAACB8DEA3B8"/>
dry and duſty, but following the rivulet from the well, he traced it to a wide lake which the ſupply, ſlow and conſtant, kept always full. He waked and determined to grow rich by ſilent proſus and induſtry.</hi>

               <p>IF, as the Perſians aſſert, we might believe that the univerſe is in ſubjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to two principles, of which one does the little good which is conſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and the other the evil every where ſo abundant, we would be inclined to believe that Africa is the place where the evil principle, in a particular man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, exerciſes his power. No portion of the globe produces ſuch variety of poiſons, ſo many wild beaſts and veno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous reptiles. The little which we know of the hiſtory of Morocco, of the Negroes of Adra, of Jaggas, the native inhabitants of the coaſts, as far as the country of the Hottentots, bears a remarkable reſemblance to the natural hiſtory of lions, panthers, and ſerpents, which are ſo worthy of partaking this parching region with theſe cannibal Princes which ſell and eat the fleſh of their priſoners. In the midſt of theſe diſguſting and horrible ſcenes, where
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:030546_0018_0FE7BAB189CCB290"/>
ſome ſell their children, and others eat their captives, we ſometimes, may diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover traces of natural juſtice, of gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uine virtue, of conſtancy in ſuffering, and a generous, contempt of death. Theſe examples, rare as they may be are ſufficient to intereſt us in this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded part of the human ſpecies, to make us remember that they ſtill are men: juſt as in a barren deſart, a few ſolitary blades of verdure, which the traveller is from time to time delighted to diſcover, ſuffice to convince him that he ſtill treads upon the earth.</p>
               <p>IN the kingdom of Juida, ſituated on the coaſt of Guinea, beyond the Cape of three points, and not far from Sabi, its capital, there lived, in the year 1727, a poor widow, named Darina; ſhe was the mother of three ſons, whom ſhe had brought up with a tenderneſs fortunately common in human nature, but very uncommon in the climates where children are conſidered as an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle of trade, and ſold for ſlaves by their unfeeling parents. The oldeſt of theſe were called Guberi; the ſecond Teloa; and the youngeſt Selico. All of theſe were amiable and ſenſible; they adored their good mother, who, now
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:030546_0019_0FE7BAB3142EB7B0"/>
grown old and infirm, lived only by their induſtry. The wealth of this fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily conſiſted only of a hut, in which they lived together, with a little field contiguous, the maize of which was their ſupport. Every morning, taking it by turns, one of the three brothers went to the chace, another worked in the field, the third remained at home with their mother: in the evening they met, the huntſman produced his par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triges, parrot, or perhaps a little ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; the huſbandman brought fuel, whilſt he who ſtayed at home provided their common meat. They ſupped af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately together, contending who ſhould be moſt attentive to their mother: they received her bleſſing, and reclin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon ſtraw, by the ſide of each other, they went to ſleep expecting the morrow.</p>
               <p>SELICO, the youngeſt of the breth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren, went often to the town to carry the firſt fruits of the harveſt, the offering of this poor family, to the temple of the great divinity of their country. This god, it is well known, is a huge ſerpent of that ſpecies which are not venomous and do no injury; on the contrary, they deſtroy thoſe ſerpents
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:030546_0020_0FE7BAB6DA463A10"/>
which are venomous; and they are ſo venerated at Juida, that it is conſidered as a horrible crime to put one to death. Thus the number of theſe ſacred ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pents has multiplied without end, in the midſt of their towns and villages, and, even within houſes, one meets, at eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſtep, theſe deities, who come fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly to feel at the tables of their worſhippers, ſleeping near their fires, and producing their young upon their beds; which laſt is conſidered by them at the happieſt of omens.</p>
               <p>OF all the Negroes of Juida, Selico was the blackeſt, the beſt made, and the moſt amiable. In the temple of their great deity he had ſeen the young Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſſa, daughter to the Chief Prieſt, who, by her figure, her beauty, and her grace, was far ſuperior to all her companions. Selico conceived a paſſion for her, and was beloved in return. Every Friday, the day ſacred amongſt the Negroes to repoſe and religion, the young lover ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared at the temple, paſſed the day in the ſociety of his dear Beriſſa, told her of his mother, his tender paſſion, and of the happineſs they ſhould enjoy when united in marriage. Beriſſa did not appear to conceal that ſhe equally
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:030546_0021_0FE7BAB80D1C9528"/>
deſired this moment to arrive; and the venerable Farulho, her father, who approved of the connection, promiſed, with embraces, ſoon to reward their tenderneſs.</p>
               <p>AT length this period, ſo anxiouſly expected, drew nigh.—The day was fixed; the mother of Selico and the two brothers had made ready the hut for the young couple, when the famous Truro Audati, King of Dahomai, whoſe rapid victories have been celebrated even in Europe, invading the kingdom of Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dra, exterminating the inhabitants, and advancing at the head of his formidable army, was checked only by the great river which bounded the realms of the ſovereign of Juida. This laſt a week and timid Prince, governed by his wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and his miniſters, did not think even of collecting a few troops to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the conqueror. He believed that the deities of the country knew well enough how to defend the entrance, and carried to the banks of the river all the ſacred ſerpents that could be got toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. The Prince of Dahomai, ſurpriſed and indignant at having only reptiles to combat, threw himſelf into the ſtream with his troops, and gained the oppoſite
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:030546_0022_0FE7BABBA3EEEDC8"/>
bank, and very ſoon theſe gods, from whom miracles were expected, were cut to pieces, roaſted on the fire, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured by the conquerors. Then the King of Juida, thinking that nothing elſe could ſave him, abandoned his ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital, and haſtened to conceal himſelf in a remote iſland. The warriors of Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dati ſpread themſelves every where, carrying with them fire and ſword.—They burned the crops, towns, and vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, and maſſacred without mercy all that they could find.</p>
               <p>TERROR diſperſed the few inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants who eſcaped the carnage. The three brothers, on the approach of the conquerors, had taken their mother on their ſhoulders and haſtened to conceal themſelves in the woods. Selico would not leave Darina whilſt ſhe was expoſed to the ſmalleſt danger; but the moment he ſaw her in ſafety, trembling for the fate of Beriſſa, he flew to Sabi, to ſave or periſh with her. Sabi was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the Dahomians. The ſtreets flowed with blood! the houſes were plundered and deſtroyed; the palace of the King and the temple of the ſerpent were nothing but ſmoaking ruins, cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered with dead bodies, whoſe heads, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording

               <p>AFTER dedicating five days to this terrible ſearch, doubting not but that Beriſſa and her father had become the victims of the ferocious Dahomians, Selico determined to return to his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He found her in the wood where he had left her with his brothers. The fixed ſorrow of Selico, his manner, and his wild looks, terrified this unhappy fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily! Darina lamented his misfortune, and tried various conſolations; to all of which her ſon was inſenſible. He refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed all nouriſhment, and ſeemed deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to expire by famine. Guberi and Teloa did not attempt to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> him by argument and reaſon, but they pointed to their venerable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:030546_0024_0FE7BAC0C4134DF0"/>
They demanded of him. <q>whether at that ſight he had not the courage to live?</q>
               </p>
               <p>SELICO promiſed that he would, and forced himſelf to think of nothing but of dividing with his two brothers the tender attentions which they paid their parent. They plunged in to the woods, went ſtill farther from Sabi, built themſelves a hut in a remote val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and thought of ſupplying by the chace, the maize and the vegetables which they were without.</p>
               <p>DEPRIVED of their bows and arrows, and of all their other neceſſaries, which they had no time to carry away, they ſoon began to feel the extreme of miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Fruits were in theſe foreſts rarely to be found, where the prodigious number of apes were always prepared to diſpute them with the three broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. The earth produced nothing but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>. They had no inſtrument to turn, nor grain to plant it. The rainy ſeaſon came on, and the horrors of famine attacked them. The poor mother al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in miſery, reclined upon a bed of dry leaves, was ready to expire, but without a complaint. Her ſons, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited by hunger, could no longer pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etrate
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:030546_0025_0FE7BAC1CE30E388"/>

Compelled at length to take ſome ſtep, they held a conſultation at the deſire of Darina. Guberi propoſed firſt they ſhould penetrate as far as the coaſt, and ſell one of their number to the firſt European they might meet; and to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe with the money, bread, maize, and inſtruments of agriculture, with which they might ſupport their mother. The brothers replied to this, but with a melancholy ſilence—<q>To ſeperate from each other for ever! to become the ſlaves of white men!</q> the Idea drove them near to diſtraction. 'Which ſhall be ſold?' cried Teloa, in a tone of grief. 'Lots muſt decide it,' repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Guberi. <q>Let us place three ſtones of different ſizes in this clay veſſel, ſhake them together, and he who
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:030546_0026_0FE7BAC581E3EAD0"/>
draws the leaſt, muſt be the unhappy perſon.—No, my brother,' interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Selico, the lot is already drawn. I am the moſt miſerable of all; you forget that I have loſt Beriſſa, and that you alone prevented me from dying, by ſaying I might be uſeful to my mother. Confirm what you have ſaid—this is the time—ſell me!</q>
               </p>
               <p>GUBERI and Teloa attempted in vain to oppoſe the generous pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of their brother; Selico reſiſted their expoſtulations, refuſed to draw his lot, and threatened to go by him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf if they would not accompany him; at length the two eldeſt gave way. It was agreed that Guberi ſhould continue with his mother, and that Teloa ſhould conduct Selico to the Dutch fort, where he ſhould receive the price of his broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's liberty, and that he ſhould immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately return with the proviſions which they wanted. When this was deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, Selico alone forbore to weep, but he found it difficult indeed to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain them when he was to leave his mother, bid her an eternal adieu, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace her for the laſt time, and what is more, deceive her by promiſing ſoon to return with Teloa, ſaying that they were
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:030546_0027_0FE7BAC7029F0158"/>
only about to viſit their former habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to ſee if they could again take poſſeſſion of it. The good old woman believed them, yet ſhe could hardly tear herſelf from her ſons arms; ſhe trembled at the danger they were about to encounter: and, by an involuntary motion, ran after Selico the moment ſhe loſt ſight of his perſon.</p>
               <p>THE two brothers, of whom it could not be ſaid which was moſt unhappy, in a ſhort time arrived at Sabi. Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der had then ceaſed, peace began again to ſmile, the king of Dahomai undiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbed poſſeſſor of the States of Juida, wiſhed to encourage a commerce with Europeans, whom he invited to his city. Many Engliſh and French merchants were received at the Monarch's court, who ſold them his numerous priſoners, and divided amongſt his troops the lands of the vanquiſhed. Teola ſoon found a merchant who offered him an hundred crowns for his young brother. As he heſitated, trembled in all his limbs, and diſputed about this horrible bargain, a trumpet was heard, and a public cryer announced with a loud voice, that the king of Dahomai promiſed: our hundred ounces of gold to whoever would bring
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:030546_0028_0FE7BACA93CB3ED8"/>
him alive a young Negro, who the night before bad dared to profane the ſcraglio of the Monarch, and had eſcaped to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the caſt, from the purſuit of the guards. Selico heard the proclamation, made a ſign to Teloa not to conclude his bargain with the merchant; and taking his brother aſide, ſpoke to him thus, in a firm tone: <q>You are come to ſell me, and I wiſhed that you ſhould, in order to ſupport my mother, but the ſmall ſum which this white of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers you cannot prove of material importance; four hundred ounces of gold will ſecure certain wealth for ever to you and Daria. You muſt get this my brother; bind me this moment, and carry me to the King as the guilty perſon whom he wants,—Be not alarmed, I know as well as you do what puniſhment I have to expect, I have calculated how long it will endure, it will not exceed an hour, and when my mother brought me forth ſhe ſuffered more.</q>

I ſave my mother's life by my death, I make my brothers rich for ever, and I eſcape a ſlavery which might be protracted for forty years.

               </p>
               <p>AWED by the manner and the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent in which Selico pronounced theſe laſt words, Teloa ventured not to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply; he obeyed his brother, went and got cords, bound his hands behind him, bathing the knots with his tears, and, making him walk before him proceeded to the King's palace.</p>
               <p>STOPPED by the guards, he demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed an audience of the King: he was an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced and introduced.

ſuperbly dreſſed, were proſtrate twenty feet from him. The moſt va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liant were diſtinguiſhed by a collar of human teeth, each of which teſtified a victory. Many females with muſkets on their ſhoulders guarded the door of the apartment. Large golden vaſes containing palm wine, brandy, and ſtrong liquors, were placed at ſome diſtance from the King, and the hall was paved with the ſculls of his enemies. 'Sovereign of the world!' cried Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loa, proſtrating himſelf on the ground, <q>I come in compliance with your ſacred orders to deliver into your hands—.</q> He could not finiſh, and his voice died away upon his lips. The King interrogated him, but he could make no reply. At length Selico be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan:</p>

               </p>
               <p>THE King, without vouchſafing any anſwer, made a ſign to one of his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, who, viewing the priſoner, gave him into the cuſtody of the female guards, and paid Teloa the four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ounces of gold. This laſt, taking the gold, the touch of which agonized his ſoul, went and purchaſed proviſions; and, precipitately leaving the town, made hade to his mother.</p>
               <p>ALREADY, by order of the Prince, they were making ready the horrible puniſhment to which they are doomed who commit adultery with the wives of the ſovereign. Two large trenches are ſunk at a ſmall diſtance from each other. In that which is intended for the guilty female, they fix the unfortunate culprit to a ſtake, and all the women of the ſeraglio, clothed in their moſt ſumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous dreſſes, carrying in their hands large veſſels of boiling water, advance to the found of tabors and flutes, to pour this water upon her head till ſhe expires. The other trench contains a pile of wood, upon which they place a croſs

               <p>THE place was filled with people; the troops under aims formed a ſquare, beating their ſpears and muſkets; the prieſts, in their dreſſes of ceremony, waited for the two victims to lay their hands upon them and devote them to death. They appeared from different corners, guarded by the armed females. Selico, calm and reſigned, advanced with his head raiſed up. When he came towards the ſtake he could not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void lifting his eyes towards the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion of his miſery. What was his aſtoniſhment and grief on beholding Beriſſa! He uttered a loud cry, and would have darted to her, but was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held by the executioners. Soon his firſt emotion gave way to indignation—'Wretch! that I am,' he cried, <q>whilſt I courted death, hoping again to meet her, ſhe was amongſt theſe vile fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>males who contend for a tyrant's affections.

               </p>
               <p>At this inſtant the wretched Beriſſa recognizing Selico uttered a loud ſcream; ſhe called the prieſts, and declared to them aloud, that the young man they were about to kill, was not he who had penetrated the ſeraglio. She ſwore this by the heavens, by the mountains, the thunder and the moſt auguſt of the ſacred ſerpents. The prieſts intimidated, ordered the execution to be ſuſpended, and ran to inform the king, who was himſelf preſent. Indignation and fury diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed the countenance of the monarch when he approached Beriſſa.—'Slave!' ſaid he in a terrible voice—<q>thou who contemneſt the love of thy maſter, thou whom I wouldſt have raiſed to the rank of my firſt ſultana, and who in ſpite of your refu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

lover, name who he is—deliver the guilty to my juſtice, I will releaſe the innocent!</q>
               </p>
               <p>'King of Dahomai,' replied Beriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſa, who was already ſecured to the fatal ſtake, <q>I cannot accept thy heart I poſſeſs not my own; I did not fear to tell you ſo. Do you think that ſhe who would not live to ſhare a crown, would ſpeak a falſhood at the moment of death! No, I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs all, and repeat my refuſal. A man did laſt night enter my apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, he did not leave it till the morning—but this was not the man! You aſk me to name him, I ought not, I will not; I am ready to die; I know that nothing can ſave me, and I only protract the fatal moment to prevent you from perpetrating a crime. I again ſwear to you, king of Dahomai, that the blood of this innocent perſon will fall upon your head: deliver him, and puniſh me! I have no more to ſay.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The king was ſtruck with Beriſſa's words, as well as with her manner of pronouncing them. He gave no or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, but reclining his head, was aſtoniſhed
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:030546_0035_0FE7BADCF0EBBA38"/>
at the reluctance which he this moment felt to ſhed blood. But re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering that this negro had accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed himſelf, and attributing to love, the intereſt which Beriſſa diſcovered for him, all his rage was rekindled. He made a ſign to the executioners; the pile was lighted, the women ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced with their veſſels of boiling water, when an old man out of breath, covered with wounds and duſt, burſt through the crowd, and ſuddenly threw himſelf at the feet of the king.</p>
               <p>'Stop!' ſaid he, <q>I implore you ſtop; I alone am the guilty perſon; it is I who have burſt through the walls of your ſeraglio, attempting the delivery of my daughter. I was once the high prieſt of the deity who was here adored. They tore my child from my arms, and conducted her to this palace. Since that time, I eagerly have ſought an opportunity to ſee her again. This laſt night I penetrated to her apartment—in vain did ſhe attempt to follow me, for your guards diſcovered us. I eſca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped alone, notwithſtanding the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows with which you ſee me pierced.

I come to offer you your victim! I come to expire with her, for whom alone I deſired to live!</q>
               </p>
               <p>He had had hardly finiſhed when the king commanded the prieſts to releaſe the unhappy priſoners, and bring them before him.—He examined Selico, wiſhing to know what important mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive could induce him voluntarily to ſeek ſo dreadful a puniſhment.</p>
               <p>Selico, whoſe heart panted with joy at finding Beriſſa again, and faithful, was not afraid to reveal every thing to the Monarch. He related to him his misfortunes, the diſtreſſes of his moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and the reſolution he had taken to obtain for her the four hundred ounces of gold. Beriſſa and her father heard him with tears of delight and admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: the chiefs the ſoldiers, and the people melted with tenderneſs: the king himſelf perceived tears to fall, which never before had bedewed his cheeks.—Such is the charm of virtue, that barbarians themſelves adore it!</p>
               <p>After hearing Selico, the king gave him his hand, and bade him riſe, and, turning to the European merchants, whom this ſpectacle had collected,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:030546_0037_0FE7BAE1224B7AE0"/>
'You,' ſaid he, <q>to whom wiſdom, experience, and the illumination of a long civilization, have ſo long taught what is the ſpecific value of a man, Of how much value think you is this?</q> A young Frenchman more bold than the reſt, exclaimed, <q>Ten thouſand crowns of gold!</q>—<q>Which ſhall be given to Beriſſa,</q> ſaid the king, <q>with this ſhe may purchaſe the hand of Selico.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This order was executed on the ſpot, and the king of Dahomai retired, aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed at feeling a delight he had never before experienced.</p>
               <p>Farulho the very ſame day gave his daughter to Selico. The young cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, accompanied by the old man, departed next day with their treaſure, to go in ſearch of Darina. She, as well as the brothers of Selico, were ready almoſt to expire from joy.—This virtuous family ſeparated no more, but well enjoyed their riches, and in a barbarous region, offered, for a long period, the faireſt example which heaven could give to the earth—that of happineſs and wealth pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by virtue.</p>

               <p>Aſem had ſpent his youth with men, had ſhared in their amuſements; and had been taught to love his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low creatures with the moſt ardent affection: but, from the tenderneſs of his diſpoſition, he exhauſted all his fortune in relieving the wants of the diſtreſſed. The petitioner never ſued in vain; the weary traveller never paſſed his door; he only deſiſted from doing good, when he had no longer the power of relieving.</p>
               <p>From a fortune thus ſpent in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence, he expected a grateful re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn from thoſe he had formerly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, and made his application with

confidence of redreſs: the ungrateful world ſoon grew weary of his impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity; for pity is but a ſhort lived paſſion. He ſoon, therefore, began to view mankind in a very different light from that in which he had before beheld them. He perceived a thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and vices he had never before expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to exiſt; wherever he turned, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude, diſſimulation, and treach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, contributed to increaſe his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtation of them. Reſolved there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to continue no longer in a world which he hated, and which repaid his deteſtation with contempt, he retired to this region of ſterility, in order to brood over his reſentment in ſolitude, and converſe with the only honeſt heart he knew, namely, with his own.</p>
               <p>A cave was his only ſhelter from the inclemency of the weather; fruits gathered with difficulty from the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's ſide, his only food; and his drink was fetched with danger and to<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

was able to live independently of his fellow creatures.</p>
               <p>At the foot of the mountain, an extenſive lake diſplayed its glaſſy bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom reflecting on its broad ſurface the impending horrors of the mountain. To this capacious mirror he would ſometimes deſcend, and reclining on its ſteep bank, caſt an eager look on the ſmooth expanſe that lay before him. "How beautiful," he often cried, is nature! how lovely, even in her wildeſt ſcenes! How finely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſted is the level plain that lies be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath me, with you awful pile that hides its tremendous head in clouds! But the beauty of theſe ſcenes is no way comparable with their utility: from hence an hundred rivers are ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, which diſtribute health and ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure to the various countries thro' which they flow. Every part of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe is beautiful, juſt, and wiſe: but man, vile man, is a ſoleciſm in nature, the only monſter in the creation. Tempeſts and whirlwinds have their uſe; but vicious, ungrateful man, is a blot in the fair page of univerſal beauty. Why was <hi>I</hi> born of that deteſted

ſpecies, whoſe vices are almoſt a reproach to the wiſdom of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Creator! were men entirely free from vice, all would be uniformi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, harmony and order. A world of moral rectitude, ſhould be the reſult of a perfectly moral agent. Why, why then, O Alla! muſt I be thus confined in darkneſs, doubt, and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair!"</p>
               <p>Juſt as he uttered the word deſpair, he was going to plunge into the lake be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neath him, at once to ſatisfy his doubts, and put a period to his anxiety; when he perceived a moſt majeſtic being walking on the ſurface of the water, and approaching the bank on which he ſtood. So unexpected an object at once checked his purpoſe: he ſtopped, contemplated, and fancied he ſaw ſomething awful and divine in his aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect.</p>
               <p>"Son of Adam," cried the genius, "ſtop thy raſh purpoſe; the father of the faithful has ſeen thy juſtice, thy integrity, thy miſeries, and hath ſent me to afford and adminiſter relief. Give me thine hand, and follow, without trembling, wherever I ſhall

lead. In me behold the genius of conviction, kept by the great Prophet, to turn from their errors thoſe who go aſtray, not from curioſity, but a rectitude of intention. Follow me, and be wiſe."</p>
               <p>Aſem immediately deſcended upon the lake, and his guide conducted him along the ſurface of the water, till, coming near the centre of the lake, they both began to ſink; the waters cloſed over their heads; they deſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſeveral hundred fathoms, till Aſem, juſt ready to give up his life as inevit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably loſt, found himſelf with his ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtial guide in another world, at the bottom of the waters, where human foot had never trod before. His aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment was beyond deſcription, when he ſaw a ſun like that he had left, a ſerene ſky over his head, and bloom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing verdure under his feet.</p>
               <p>"I plainly perceive your amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment," ſaid the genius; "but ſuſpend it for a while. This world was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by Alla, at the requeſt, and under the inſpection of our great prophet; who once entertained the ſame doubts which filled your mind when I found

you, and from the conſequence of which you were ſo lately reſcued. The rational inhabitants of this world are formed agreeable to your own i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deas; they are abſolutely without vice. In other reſpect, it reſembles your earth, but differs from it in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly inhabited by men who nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er do wrong. If you find this world more agreeable than that you ſo lately left, you have free permiſſion to ſpend the remainder of your days in it; but permit me, for ſome time, to attend you, that I may ſilence your doubt, and make you better acquainted with your company and your new habita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion."</p>
               <p>"A world without vice! Rational beings without immortality!" cried Aſem, in a rapture; "I thank thee, O Alla, who haſt at length heard my petitions: this, this indeed will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce happineſs, ecſtacy and eaſe. O for an immortality, to ſpend it among men who are incapable of ingratitude, injuſtice, fraud, violence, and a thouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>and other crimes, that render ſociety miſerable!"</p>

"Ceaſe thine acclamations," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied the genius. "Look around thee; reflect on every object and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion before us, and communicate to me the reſult of thine obſervations. Lead wherever you think proper, I ſhall be your attendant and inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or." Aſem and his companion trav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elled on in ſilence for ſome time, the former being entirely loſt in aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; but, at laſt, recovering his former ſerenity, he could not help obſerving, that the face of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try bore a near reſemblance to that he had left, except that this ſubterranean world ſtill ſeemed to retain its prime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val wildneſs.</p>
               <p>"Here," cried Aſem, "I perceive animals of prey, and others that ſeem only deſigned for their ſubſiſtence; it is the very ſame in the world over our heads. But had I been permitted to inſtruct our prophet, I would have removed this defect, and formed no voracious or deſtructive animals, which only prey on the other parts of the creation." "Your tenderneſs for inferior animals is, <hi>I</hi> find, remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble," ſaid the genius, ſmiling. "But,

with regard to meaner creatures, this world exactly reſemble; the other; and, indeed, for obvious reaſons; for the earth can ſupport a more conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able number of animals, by their thus becoming food for each other, than if they had lived entirely on the vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble productions. So that animals of different natures thus formed, inſtead of leſſening their multitude, ſubſiſt in the greateſt number poſſible. But let us haſten on to the inhabited coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try before us, and ſee what that offers for inſtruction."</p>
               <p>They ſoon gained the utmoſt verge of the foreſt, and entered the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try inhabited by men without vice; and Aſem anticipated in idea the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional delight he hoped to experience in ſuch an innocent ſociety. But they had ſcarce left the confines of the wood, when they beheld one of the inhabitants flying, with haſty ſteps, with terror in his countenance, from an army of ſquirrels, that cloſely pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued him. "Heavens!" cried Aſem, "why does he fly? What can he fear from animals ſo contemptible?" He had ſcarce ſpoken, when he perceived

                  </gap> his," cried Aſem to his guide, "is truly ſurpriſing; nor can I conceive the reaſon for ſo ſtrange an action," "Every ſpecies of animals," replied the genius, "has of late, grown very powerful in this country; for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, at firſt, thinking it unjuſt to uſe either fraud or force in deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, they have inſenſibly increaſed, and now frequently ravage their harmleſs frontiers." "But they ſhould have been deſtroyed," cried Aſem; "you ſee the conſequence of ſuch neglect," "Where is then that tenderneſs you ſo lately expreſſed for ſubordinate animals!" replied the genius, ſmiling; "I muſt acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge my miſtake," returned Aſem: "<hi>I</hi> am now convinced that we muſt be guilty of tyranny and injuſtice to the brute creation, if we would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the world ourſelves. But let us no longer obſerve the duty of man to theſe irrational creatures, but ſurvey their connections with one another."</p>
               <p>As they walked farther up the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, the more he was ſurpriſed to ſee
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:030546_0047_0FE7BC0BC21B2770"/>
no veſtiges of handſome houſes, no cities, nor any mark of elegant de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign. His conductor perceiving his ſurpriſe, obſerved, that the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of this new world were perfectly content with their ancient ſimplicity, each had an houſe, which, tho' home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, was ſufficient to lodge his little family; they were too good to build houſes, which could only increaſe their own pride, and the envy of the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tator; what they built was for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, and not for ſhow. "Atleaſt, then," ſaid Aſem, "they have neither architects, painters, or ſtatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, in their ſociety; but theſe are idle arts, and may be ſpared. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, before I ſpend much more time here, you ſhould have my thanks for introducing me into the ſociety of ſome of their wiſeſt men: there is ſcarce any pleaſure to me equal to a refined converſation; there is nothing of which <hi>I</hi> am ſo enamoured as wiſdom." "Wiſdom!" replied his inſtructor, "how ridiculous! We have no wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom here, for we have no occaſion for it; true wiſdom is only a knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of our own duty and the duty of

others to us; but of what uſe is ſuch wiſdom here? each intuitively per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forms what is right in himſelf, and expects the ſame from others. If, by wiſdom, you ſhould mean vain curioſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity and empty ſpeculation; as ſuch pleaſures have their origin in vanity, luxury, or avarice, we are too good to purſue them," "All this may be right," ſays Aſem; but methinks I obſerve a ſolitary diſpoſition prevail among the people; each family keeps ſeparately within their own precincts without ſociety or without inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe." "That indeed is true," replied the other; "here is no eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed ſociety; nor ſhould there be any: all ſocieties are made either through fear or friendſhip; the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple we are among are too good to fear each other; and there are no motives to private friendſhip, where all are equally meritorious." "Well then," ſaid the ſceptic, "as I am to ſpend my time here, if I am to have neither the polite arts, nor wiſdom, nor friendſhip in ſuch a world, I ſhould be glad, at leaſt, of an eaſy companion, who may tell me his thoughts, and to whom I

may communicate mine." "And to what purpoſe ſhould either do this?" ſays the genius: flattery or curioſity are vicious motives, and never allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of here; and wiſdom is out of the queſtion."</p>
               <p>"Still, however," ſaid Aſem, "the inhabitants muſt be happy; each is contented with his own poſſeſſions, nor avariciouſly endeavors to heap up more than his own ſubſiſtence; each has the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

He had ſcarce ſpoken when his ears were aſſaulted with the lamentations of a wretch who ſat by the way ſide, and, in the moſt deplorable diſtreſs, ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed gently to murmur at his own miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Aſem immediately ran to his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, and found him in the laſt ſtage of a conſumption. "Strange," cried the ſon of Adam, "that men who are free from vice ſhould thus ſuffer ſo much miſery without relief!" "Be not ſurpriſed," ſaid the wretch who was dying, "would it not be the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt injuſtice for beings, who have only juſt ſufficient to ſupport themſelves, and are content with a bare ſubſiſtence,

               <p>"They ſhould have been ſupplied with more than is neceſſary," cried Aſem; and yet <hi>I</hi> contradict my own opinion but a moment before: all is doubt, perplexity, and confuſion. Even the want of ingratitude is no virtue here, ſince they never received a favor. They have, however, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother excellency yet behind; the love of their country is ſtill, I hope, one of their darling virtues." "Peace, Aſem," replied the guardian, with a countenance not leſs ſevere than beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful, "nor forfeit all thy pretentions to wiſdom; the ſame ſelfiſh motives by which we prefer our own intereſt to that of others, induce us to regard our country preferably to that of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother.

My father whoſe name was William Seymour, lived in the town of Briſtol, in England, and followed mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandiſe. In the early part of my life, he had been ſucceſsful in buſineſs, and had prudently depoſited a compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency in the funds, in caſe of acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents (to which trade is proverbially expoſed.) He married early, and had ſeveral children, all of whom he loſt young, expect an elder ſiſter and my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. While my father was in the full career of ſucceſs, my ſiſter married a gentleman of fortune, family, ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucation and benevolence. He lived on his income at no great diſtance from my father's, on a ſmall but highly cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivated eſtate.</p>
               <p>When the moment arrived in which my ſiſter was to part with the home where ſhe had been reared, and from the dear connections who had hither to gladdened her exiſtence—her heart ſunk—her reſolution vaniſhed—ſhe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on my attending her—and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of her family, until ſhe could, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> degree, loſe the remembrance of home. I was young, but fifteen years of age,—and was pleaſed with
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:030546_0056_0FE7C44B1A2826D8"/>
the ſcene for its novelty. I accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly took my leave of home to ſtay a few weeks with my ſiſter. Three months I paſſed with her in uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted happineſs. Time then had the doves wings, we received the higheſt attentions the neighbours could pay us, and, poſſeſſed as we truly were of "health, peace and competence" the poet's definition of happineſs: in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, converſation, viſits and work, we enjoyed life as highly as mortals could do.</p>
               <p>But the tide was now to ebb, the ſcene was to undergo a change,—a change which firſt brought me to an acquaintance with ſorrow and misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. I was ſuddenly ſent for home, my mother was ſaid to be dangerouſly ill—ſhe had taken a violent cold which brought on a pleuriſy,—a high fever accompanied it—ſhe became delirious, and her life was deſpaired of by the phyſicians. We arrived in time to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold her a living mother. About the time we reached my father's houſe her diſorder ſeemed to take a favorable turn—She became herſelf, ſhe recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſed her children—and poſſeſſed her
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:030546_0057_0FE7C44CB2319818"/>
reaſon enough to give us her dying bleſſing and parting advice. "I feel, ſaid ſhe, my children, taking us in her arms, as ſhe ſat up in her bed, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bracing us moſt tenderly, I feel the powers of nature failing,—my nerves are weakened, my heart has that aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fluttering which aſſures me of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching death." Our ſobs here in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted her addreſs, but reſuming the ſubject with a tremulous voice and an aſpect in which heaven itſelf was ſeated, ſhe continued, "the cold hand of death is already laid upon me—I feel an icy torpor creeping through my veins: let me tell my daughters all my heart ere it be forever too late.—To the goodneſs of God and the care of his divine providence I then recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend you both—the God who has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and guided the parent from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy to mature age, will not forget the offspring.

Here a faintneſs ſeized her—ſhe fell back, and—a gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral ſhriek of horror pervaded the chamber—ſhe opened her eyes,—they ſoon cloſed again—and with one deep groan her ſpirit returned to him who gave it.</p>
               <p>The impreſſions made on the mind of us all, by ſuch an event, may be pourtrayed by fancy but never by lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. My father who was a man of warm feelings, and a moſt affectionate diſpoſition was in a degree frantic. He was ſtill through the day: now and then he would break out into violent fits of weeping, which would ſubſide again and leave him compoſed and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholly: but at night he had no ſoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er cloſed his eyes than he became wild and flighty. We were obliged to keep

a light in his room and to have a ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant with him all night. He needed conſolation but who could impart it?—we were all ſo depreſſed by the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den miſfortune, that neither could give comfort to the other.</p>
               <p>For my own part, I felt myſelf ſo overwhelmed by the ſtroke, that my heart literally died within me. I felt for my own ſituation, but if poſſible I ſuffered more for my father's—I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered myſelf, indeed, as deprived of my beſt friend and inſtructreſs, I fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaw the loſs I ſhould ſuſtain in the want of her advice and guidance: and I ſhuddered at the ſnares and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties I might be expoſed to in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly life, thus deſtitute of her patronage, and ſociety—but what were theſe, compared to my fathers feelings! to have the neareſt friend of his boſom thus torn away—the friend he had early and long loved as himſelf—thus wreſted from his arms forever—was a ſtate of forlorn wretchedneſs from which human nature recoils and which he was not calculated to endure. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, ſuch was the effect this had on him, that he cloſed his accounts—
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:030546_0062_0FE7C45BCDB0A768"/>
withdrew from buſineſs, and purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed a ſmall country ſeat not far from his ſon-in-law's, to which he immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately retired.</p>
               <p>On his firſt retreat his ſpirits utterly abandoned him—he loſt the vivacity which once diſtinguiſhed him, became fond of ſolitary walks, and was much alone in his chamber. Depreſſed as I was myſelf, I found it neceſſary to make exertions to draw him into con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, and to prevent his mind from <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>My ſiſter and my brother in law of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten viſited us—and by their converſation and tenderneſs relieved my fath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er's mind greatly of its depreſſive gloom—Time however, did more for him than our exertions: the traits of grief faded from his heart gradually—till within the compaſs of a year, he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan at times to reſume ſomething of his former gaiety, and ſprightlineſs yet ſhortly after a turn of gaiety he would <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

converſe of my departed mother,—to recall her memory—to praiſe her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues—and to recommend them to my imitation. Indeed this was leſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary than he imagined; they had deeply impreſſed my mind, though I knew it not till ſhe was gone.</p>
               <p>I was not the only perſon however, with whom he converſed of his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented wife. There was a neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing widow lady who lived about half a mile from us, to whom he uſed often to unfold his heart and to diſcloſe its ſorrows—the heard him with attention, aſſented to the praiſes he beſtowed on his loſt conſort—admired his affection and ſympathiſed in his diſtreſs.

I tho't nothing could be more agreeable than to poſſeſs the whole heart of ſuch a brother, and lamented that providence had denied me one from whoſe ſociety and correſpondence I might derive the ſame benefits and pleaſures, that Julia Stanford did from thoſe of her broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Charles.

After many weeks of tedious ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation, the vacancy at length came, when the ſtudents of the university were permitted to return to their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective homes, to ſee their friends, and to procure whatever articles were neceſſary for uſe or convenience at the enſuing ſeſſion. Charles Stanford, at the time aſſigned returned to his home. Julia his ſiſter had been impatiently looking out for him in the morning, but being diſappointed in the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, ſhe had requeſted me to paſs the afternoon and evening with her as an object on which to reſt her heart and rel<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>When I went to mr. Stanford's I found Julia penſive and alone. Her father was from home, and her moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er up ſtairs: ſhe had all things pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for tea, and was ſickening with impatience at the delay of her broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:030546_0069_0FE7C477156EA608"/>
My preſence was an inſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to her. We ſat down and began to chat ſeriouſly together: but were ſuddenly interrupted by a chaiſe ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping at the door. Inſtantly a young man's voice was heard in the entry: Julia in a moment recogniz'd it to be her brother's: ſhe flew to receive him: they met at the parlour door as ſhe opened it—their <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

Stanford to me as her "dear brother" and mentioned my name to him. We gaz'd on each other with a little confuſion; and often as our eyes met each other's in the courſe of the evening, a tranſient bluſh ſeem'd to overſpread he face of the youth. We were able however to exchange a few words: but finding that I laid a kind of reſtraint on the feelings of the brother and ſiſter, I took an early leave of Julia, not, however, with her ready acquieſcence, nor without a poſitive promiſe to come and ſpend the next day with her.</p>

Many de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful rambles we took round the town—and to places of public reſort—and I felt happy in finding our ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction with each other daily increaſe.</p>
               <p>As the day approached, on which Charles Stanford was to take his leave of Briſtol for ſome months: and to repair to Oxford, I could obſerve he began to grow thoughtful and ſilent: he loſt much of the cheerfulneſs he poſſeſſed on his firſt return from col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, and devoted himſelf much to grave company. Juſt before he left home, he came to take leave of me,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:030546_0071_0FE7C47E577CA260"/>
and as he ſaid "to offer me his beſt wiſhes for my health and happineſs." He ſeem'd much embarraſs'd with the taſk, and kne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> not how to proceed. When he roſe to make his adieu, he could ſay nothing—his eyes were downcaſt as well as mine, once or twice we each had reſolution to raiſe them—but on meeting both were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and embarraſſed. Thus we ſtood for nearly five minutes. At length, taking my hand, he raiſed it with ſome difficulty to his lips—and at the ſame time left in the hand he thus took, a beautiful locket ſet round with pearl; on the one ſide of which, were the two letters C. S. worked I ſuppoſe with his own hair, on the other a youth approaching an altar, on which was written "ſacred to friendſhip"—with a heart in his hand as an offering, and on the ſmall ſold of paper in which this preſent was wrapped, the following words were written—
<q>
                     <l>Think not, Amelia, that my heart</l>

               </p>
               <p>Some time after Charles had gone, and the flutter of my ſpirits had ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided, and when I was capable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flexion, I began to ponder on theſe ſtrange appearances—I was painfully dubious whether I acted properly or not in keeping this preſent—I more than once was on the point of ſending it to his ſiſter: but as this would have wounded the feelings of my Julia, and diſtreſſed Charles—and as it was intended only as a token of "friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip" I concluded I might retain it.—Often after his departure did I reſort to the drawer in which I had lock'd his gift, and many were the ſoft feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings it occaſioned to my heart.</p>
               <p>After his return to the univerſity, he wrote to his ſiſter more frequently than ever. In every letter he either made ſome enquiries concerning miſs Seymour, or ſent ſome expreſſion of friendſhip and recollection—I was pleaſed at heart with his attention—but never diſcovered it farther than to
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:030546_0073_0FE7C48594E482C0"/>
return him my compliments. With theſe at firſt he ſeemed ſatisfied—but with one act of attention, the wiſh for another aroſe, till at length he commiſſioned Julia, if poſſible, to gain my permiſſion for him to write to me occaſionally. This, however, I then refuſed.</p>
               <p>During his ſtay this ſeſſion at col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege, it was that my ſiſter was marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and that I had left home to reſide with her.

Julia, however, had promiſed me a viſit at my brother-in-law's, and as ſoon as Charles had returned, ſhe availed her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of his protection and company, and with him in a poſt chaiſe perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her promiſe. They paſſed a few days with us delightfully: our even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing rambles—our literary amuſements through the day, the beauties of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the charms of vocal and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrumental muſic, often gave a

brightneſs to our ſpirits—and a rap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to our boſoms, that language could never paint.</p>
               <p>Time, however, rolled away rapid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly—our friends left us—uncertain when we would meet again. We met, however, much ſooner, and on a more melancholy occaſion, than fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy had conjectured—but a few weeks after this the ſudden illneſs of our mother called us home—called us to a ſcene of the deepeſt woe I had ever witneſſed. During all our affliction, on this event, however, the attention and ſympathy of Julia Stanford and her brother, were a great ſource of relief and comfort.</p>
               <p>They called every day to enquire af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter our health, and ſhewed a great degree of tenderneſs which engaged my warmeſt gratitude. When my father <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

the enſuing night was I kept awake in revolving the ſcene that had taken place. Sometimes I was ſatisfied, and again out of temper with what had paſſed. On the whole, however, I was of opinion, that of all the youth I had ever been acquainted with, Charles Stanford was the one <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>On his next viſit, he found me in the garden alone with my work and my book. He approached with his uſual delicacy and diffidence: we talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſometime on general topics, ti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Mr. Stanford underſtood me—his eye, his voice and his manner expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſatisfaction—he ſaid he would take the earlieſt opportunity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a parent's conſent to his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, in which if he were ſucceſsful, he would indeed, be one of the moſt happy men in exiſtence.</p>
               <p>M. Stanford accordingly embraced the earlieſt opportunity of diſcloſing his wiſhes to my father.

We would have moſt cheerfully denied ourſelves many of the little ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to which we had been accuſtomed—We ſighed not for opulence or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction; a bare competency, and a retirement from gay &amp; faſhionable life, was our mutual choice.

               <p>Theſe reaſons, proceeding from the warmth of the heart, had little influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on the minds of our parents, who called our attachment nothing but

a wild and fooliſh liking, that would ſoon be over, and leave us independence and in want if we were now ſuffered to be united.

After can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaſſing the ſubject for ſeveral days, and deviſing means of ſupport in caſe we were abandoned by our parents, we at length came to a concluſion, and reſolved, whatever might be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, to be united in hand as in heart—to live in a retired way—to be frugal and induſtrious—and to truſt in God for welfare and happineſs. A reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution of this kind, we were ſenſible would expoſe us to the deriſion of the worldly-wiſe; but we were not to be frightened by a ſhadow, from the poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of a reality. Nature had given us firmneſs enough to reſiſt the influence
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:030546_0085_0FE7C4A381C46C50"/>
of a ſneer—and we had learned from obſervation and experience, that what the maſs of the world denominate happineſs, is but miſery in diſguiſe. In truth, the greater part of mankind, are a ſet of ſhallow dupes. They have not diſcernment to diſtinguiſh between the ſemblance and the eſſence of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs—they make it conſiſt in ſenſual gratifications, and keen pleaſures, which ever cloy by frequent enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and moſtly leave a poiſon be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind. True happineſs is ſeated only in the mind: without peace of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience and ſound intellects, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to enjoy real and permanent ſatisfaction: and with a due obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of thoſe duties we owe to our Maker, our neighbours and ourſelves—altho property be denied, happineſs may be attained—happineſs of the moſt exalted, pure, and ſubſtantial kind.</p>
               <p>Impreſſed with theſe conſiderations we prepared for the private ſolemnization of our naptials, as well as our circumſtances would permit. I prepared all my clothes, on various pretences. I perſuaded my father to advance ſome ſmall ſums of mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ey,
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:030546_0086_0FE7C4A8A5B99BA8"/>
which were expended on articles that I thought would be moſt uſeful to me. Mr. Stanford had been leſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>Thus circumſtanced, I bribed one of the domeſtics to carry my trunk to a neighboring tavern, and while my father and mother were out viſiting one evening, Mr. Stanford, agreeably to appointment, came to our houſe, and bore off his willing captive. I had ſcarcely left my home, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my heart ſunk, and my conſcience reproved me for the ſtep I had taken—I had abandoned a roof that had long kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſheltered me—I had thrown myſelf from the protection of a parent who had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

That our parents had a right to impoſe a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand, under the penalty of diſpleaſure, or of withholding property, we did not diſpute; but in our apprehenſion, a ſlen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der livelihood, gained by labor and fru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gality, was preferable to a long and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſeparation, and the hazard of life.</p>

               <p>The day after the event took place, Mr. Stanford wrote to his parents and to mine informing them of what had taken place, and apologizing for the abruptneſs of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               <p>How difficult a matter it is, for the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to recal the feelings of youth! How rare to meet with perſons advanced in years, who can enter into the feelings and views of the young, and make juſt allowances for the raſhneſs of inexperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence! When this information reached our parents, all with one voice ſeemed to condemn our conduct; they reprobated

our diſobedience in harſh terms—and by the bearer of Mr. Stanford's letter, aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red us, it was their determination to give us no manner of aſſiſtance; but, as we had provoked our own fate with open eyes, to it they reſigned us.</p>
               <p>This anſwer, though ſevere and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, was leſs ſo than it would otherwiſe have been, from our preparation for it. All we had now to do, was to adopt ſome plan, that would reſcue us from the hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors of poverty, and enable us to cultivate and conſtantly enjoy that interchange of affectionate endearments, for which we had renounced almoſt every thing beſide. The wide world was before us—its paths were many and various—it was ours to chooſe one.</p>
               <p>The beſt one we could adopt at preſent, was to ſet off immediately for London, and if we could ſoften the heart of Mr. Stanford's uncle, to engage his patronage, and thus to enſure a proviſion for neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry expenſes. We accordingly took our paſſage in a ſtage coach, and quickly reached the metropolis of England. As ſoon as Mr. Stanford could put himſelf in proper attire, he waited on his uncle, who received him graciouſly, and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red very kindly about his friends and the family. As yet Mr. Plunket (who was a maternal uncle) had heard nothing of
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:030546_0089_0FE7C4B0E6AC7F58"/>
the ſtep Mr. Stanford had taken, and therefore chearfully promiſed all the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance that was in his power, whatever line of buſineſs might be fixed on: but the following day, when Mr. Stanford called to ſettle ſome way in which to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy his talents and attention, his uncle's behaviour was totally changed.</p>
               <p>He had received a letter from his brother in law, in which mr. Stanford's conduct was highly cenſured, and a poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive requeſt made not to ſupply Mr. Stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford with money or any aſſiſtance. This was communicated to my beſt friend, as well as his uncle's reſolution to comply with the requeſt.

his heart by giving vent to his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row for a few moments. After this, he found himſelf able to communicate the grounds of his diſtreſs. The weight of a father's diſpleaſure he had prepared himſelf to endure, but to find that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure purſuing him ſo far as to prevent him from receiving any aid from an uncle, was beyond what he had ſuſpected. I ſuggeſted every conſolatory argument I could deviſe, for compoſing his mind.—I aſſured him that very little of the world's goods wold content me, while I retained his affection and ſociety—and that inſtead of ſpending time in unavailing complaints, we had both beſt put our ſhoulders to the wheel, and endeavor to procure ſubſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Accordingly, the next day, mr. Stanford went in queſt of cheap and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant lodging, and of employment. He was fortunate in providing the firſt, with an amiable, pious widow lady—who was at once an inſtructive and agreeable com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion; the ſecond he procured with an eminent printer, who was juſt th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

For this ſituation mr.

Nay, finding our family likely to increaſe, we contrived ways to lay up a ſmall capi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal as a proviſion for a rainy day—this we knew would be conſtantly accumulating, and would one day be a help to the ſweet little pledge of love, which indulgent heaven preſented us, ten months after our union.</p>

I kneeled down by his bed-ſide, and taking his hand which began to feel cold, and was covered with a chill perſpiration, "my deareſt Charles," ſaid I, "what is the matter?"—"Be not alarmed, my love," ſaid he: "but I muſt leave you very ſoon"—"O my God, my God!" cried I; it was all I could ſay—my ſight, my ſenſes left me—I ſwooned away; all that I can recollect of myſelf afterwards, is, that when I came to my ſenſes I found I had been conveyed to another cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; that ſeveral friends ſtood around me in tears: with my firſt returning breath I enquired about my dear Charles, they replied, that they ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped a change had taken place for the better; that I had beſt try and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe myſelf. I inſiſted on being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed back to my huſband; but while we were converſing on the matter, a child came haſtily into the room, and cried cut, "Mr. Stanford is dead."

               <p>My Julia who had ſupported a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant though forbidden correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence with her brother and myſelf, came with her father, and remained ſome time to attend me.

Deeply intereſted at I was for the happineſs of my friend, I took the earlieſt opportunity of learning the true ground of the report. Julia, with her uſual candour, immediately ſolved my doubts. She told me Mr. Dalton had indeed been particularly attentive to her for a ſeries of time: that he had avowed his paſſion—and gained her affection; that ſhe had heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itated a whole in conſenting to be his, as a neceſſary conſequence of this, would be her removal to America—that this was the only objection with her parents; but they had been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed on to give up this point—and conſent to a union, even on the terms of her relinquiſhing her native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try forever.</p>

I might not be of the number—ſhe urged me af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionately to blend my fate, and the fate of my little ones with hers—to leave a country, where I had few ties to bind me, and to become an adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turer with her beyond the atlantic; that ſhe would be married privately in a very ſhort time; but ſhe inſiſted

               <p>The propoſition of leaving my friends and my country, I muſt own, at firſt ſtartled me much: and in the apprehenſion of the moment, I ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted that I did not think I could com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with her benevolent requeſt; but at her solicitation, <hi>I</hi> agreed to conſider the matter ſeriouſly.

the other ſide of the ocean—and the forlorn ſituation, in which <hi>I</hi> ſhould be left, if my Julia were to die. On the other hand. <hi>I</hi> recollected the cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elty <hi>I</hi> had experienced from ſome of my neareſt relations; that my own father had abandoned me; that e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven were he to receive me beneath his roof—there <hi>I</hi> could take no comfort, with a rough unkind ſtep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mother; that dependence was there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore my lot, and that <hi>I</hi> could endure this ſtate with no one ſo well as with my ſiſter and friend.</p>

dear friend's marriage was announced to me by a letter from herſelf, and one from Mr. Dalton, in which argument and intreaty were uſed to perſuade me into a compliance with their requeſt. <hi>I</hi> did not keep them long in ſuſpence—but ſignified my acquieſcence as ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as <hi>I</hi> could, in their benevolent plan. Shortly after the adoption of this reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution, I communicated it to Mr. Plunket, with whom I ſtill was—and to my father.

As ſoon as we had landed and made enquiry into the ſtate of things, Mr. Dalton found that it was not a time to enter largely into trade—the peace between England and America had been concluded for ſome time, and a vaſt inundation of goods was pouring into the United States from every quarter; he therefore wiſely reſolved to retire from buſineſs, and fix himſelf in one of the ſmall towns of Connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>icut, near which his father lived on a large and productive farm.

               <p>I have not yet, indeed; thought of a remedy for luxury.

be executed in a great country, and whether, if they could be executed, our people generally would be happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or even richer. Is not the hope of being one day able to purchaſe and enjoy luxuries, a great ſpur to labour and induſtry? May not luxury there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore produce more than it conſumes, if without ſuch a ſpur, people would be, as they are naturally enough in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to be, lazy and indolent? to this purpoſe I remember a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance. The ſkipper of a ſhallop, employed between Cape-May and Philadelphia had done us ſome ſmall ſervices, for which he refuſed to be paid. My wife underſtanding that he had a daughter, ſent her a preſent of a new faſhioned cap. Three years after, this ſkipper being at my houſe with an old farmer of Cape-May, his paſſenger, he mentioned the cap, and how much his daughter had been pleaſed with it. "But (ſaid he) it proved a dear cap to our congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,"—"How ſo?"—"When my daughter appeared with it at meeting, it was ſo much admired, that all the

girls reſolved to get ſuch caps from Philadelphia; and my wife and I computed that the whole could not have coſt leſs than a hundred pounds"—"True, (ſaid the farmer) but you do not tell all the ſtory.—I think the cap was neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs an advantage to us; for it was the firſt thing that put our girls upon knitting worſted mittens for ſale at Philadelphia, that they might have wherewithal to buy caps and ribbons there; and you know that induſtry has continued, and is likely to contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue and increaſe to a much greater val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ue, and anſwer much better purpoſes." Upon the whole, I was more reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this little piece of luxury, ſince not only the girls were made happier by having fine caps, but the Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phians by the ſupply of warm mit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens.</p>

and ruin themſelves. Laws cannot prevent this; and perhaps it is not always an evil to the public. A ſhilling ſpent Idly by a fool may be picked up by a wiſer perſon, who knows better what to do with it. It it therefore not loſt. A vain, ſilly fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low builds a fine houſe, furniſhes it richly, lives in it expenſively, and in a few years ruins himſelf: but the maſons, carpenters, ſmiths, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther honeſt tradeſmen, have been by his employ aſſiſted in maintaining and raiſing their families: the farmer has been paid for his labour, and encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aged, and the eſtate is now in better hands.

               <p>The vaſt quantity of foreſt land we have yet to clear, and put in order for cultivation, will for a long time keep the body of our nation laborious and frugal.

The people of the trading towns may be rich and luxurious, while the country poſſeſſes all the vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues that tend to promote happineſs and public proſperity. Thoſe towns are not much regarded by the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try; they are hardly conſidered as an eſſential part of the ſtates; and the experience of the laſt war has ſhewn, that their being in the poſſeſſion of the enemy, did not neceſſarily draw on the ſubjection of the country, which bravely continued to maintain its freedom and independence notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>

It has been computed by ſome po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical arithmetician, that if every man and woman would work four hours each day on ſomething uſeful, that labour would produce ſufficient to procure all the neceſſaries and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts in life; want and miſery would be baniſhed out of the world, and the reſt of the 24 hours might be leiſure and pleaſure.</p>
               <p>What occaſions then ſo much want and miſery? It is the employment of numbers in works that produce neither the neceſſaries or conveniences of life, who with theſe who do nothing, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume neceſſaries raiſed by the labori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous. To explain this:</p>
               <p>The firſt elements of wealth are obtained by labour, from the earth and waters. I have land, and raiſe corn. With this, if I feed a fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily that does nothing my corn will be conſumed, and at the end of the year I ſhall be no richer than I was at the beginning. But if while I feed them, I employ them, ſome in ſpinning, others in making bricks, &amp;c. for building, the value of my corn will be arreſted and remain with me, and at the end of the year we may be
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:030546_0117_0FE7C519FADD4A48"/>
all better cloathed and better lodged. And if, inſtead of employing a man I feed in making bricks, I employ him in fiddling for me, the corn he eats is gone, and no part of his manufacture remains to augment the wealth and convenience of the family; I ſhall therefore be the poorer for this fid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling man, unleſs the reſt of my fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily work more or eat leſs, to make up the deficiency he occaſions.</p>
               <p>Look round the world, and ſee the millions employed in doing nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or in ſomething that amounts to no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, when the neceſſaries and con<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>veniences of life are in queſtion.—What is the bulk of commerce, for which we fight and deſtroy each other, but the toil of millions for ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, to the great hazard of many lives, by the conſtant dangers of the ſea? How much labour is ſpent in building and fitting great ſhips, to go to China and Arabia for tea and coffee, to the Weſt Indies for ſugar, and to America for tobacco? Theſe things cannot be called the neceſſaries of life, for our anceſtors lived very comfortably without them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="unknown:030546_0118_0FE7C5200FD24718"/>
A queſtion may be aſked; Could all theſe people now employed in rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, making, or carrying ſuperflui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, be ſubſiſted by raiſing neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I think they might. The world is large, and a great part of it ſtill uncultivated. Many hundred mil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lions of acres in Aſia, Africa, and America, are ſtill in a foreſt; and a great deal even in Europe. On a hundred acres of this foreſt, a man might become a ſubſtantial farmer; and a hundred thouſand men employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in clearing each his hundred acres, would hardly brighten a ſpot big e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to be viſible from the moon, unleſs with Herſchel's teleſcope; ſo vaſt are the regions ſtill in wood.</p>
               <p>It is however ſome comfort to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect, that, upon the whole, the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of induſtry and prudence among mankind, exceeds the quantity of idle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and folly.

Velaſco, whoſe reſidence was at Tyre, the capital city of the kingdom.</p>

               <p>Velaſco had two ſons, Felix and Uriano. They were both bred to commerce, though liberally educated, and had lived together from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy in the ſtricteſt harmony and friendſhip; but love, before whom all affections of the ſoul are as the traces of a ſhip upon the ocean, which remain only for a moment, threatened in an evil hour to ſet them at variance; for both of them were become enam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oured with the beauties of Proſperity. The nymph, like one of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of men, gave encouragement to each, by turns: but to avoid a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar declaration, ſhe vowed a reſolution never to marry, unleſs her ſiſter, from whom ſhe ſaid it was impoſſible for her to be long ſeparated, was married at the ſame time.</p>

What become of him afterwards, tradition does not with certainty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late. It is believed he fled into E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, and lived precariouſly on the ſcanty benevolence of at few friends who had not totally deſerted him; and that he died in a ſhort time, poor, wretched, miſerable, and an exile.</p>
               <p>Let us now return to Uranio, who, we have already obſerved, had been driven out of doors by his brother Felix. Adverſity, though hateful to his heart, and a ſpectre to his eyes, was the conſtant attendant on his ſteps; and, to aggravate his ſorrows, he received certain intelligence that his richeſt veſſel was taken by a Sar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinian pirate; that another was loſt upon the Lybian ſtraits; and, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete all, the banker, with whom the greater part of his ready money was entruſted, had deſerted his creditors, and retired into Sicily. Collecting, therefore, the ſmall remains of his fortune, he bid adieu to Tyre, and, led by Adverſity, he paſſed through unfrequented roads, and foreſts over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grown with buſhes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="130" facs="unknown:030546_0124_0FE7C5364206F390"/>
He came at laſt to a ſmall village, at the foot of a mountain; here they took up their abode for ſome time; and Adverſity, in return for all the anxiety he had ſuffered, ſoftening the ſeverity of her looks miniſtered to him the moſt faithful counſel, weaning his heart from the immoderate love of earthly things, and teaching him to revere the Almighty, and to place his whole truſt and happineſs in his gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment and protection. She human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ized his ſoul, made him modeſt and humble, taught him to compaſſionate the diſtreſſes of his fellow creatures, and inſtructed him to relieve them.</p>
               <p>"I am ſent (ſays ſhe) to thoſe only, who are the favorites of Heaven; for I not only train them up by my ſevere diſcipline to future glory, but alſo prepare them to receive with a greater reliſh all ſuch moderate enjoyments as are not inconſiſtent with this proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary ſtate. As the ſpider, when aſſailed, ſeeks ſhelter in his inmoſt web, ſo the mind, which I aſſiſt, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts its wandering thoughts, and flies for happineſs to itſelf. Proſper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, my ſmiling, but treacherous ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:030546_0125_0FE7C5387A169B00"/>
too often delivers thoſe whom ſhe has ſeduced, to be ſcourged by her cruel followers, Anguiſh and Deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair; while Adverſity never fails to lead thoſe who will be guided by her to the bliſsful habitations of Tranquil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and Content."</p>
               <p>Uranio liſtened to her words with great attention <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and as he looked ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly on her face, the deformity of it ſeemed inſenſibly to decreaſe. By gentle degrees his averſion to her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bated, and at laſt he gave himſelf wholly up to her counſel and direction. She would often repeat to him the wiſe maxims of philoſophers, that thoſe who want the feweſt things are the happieſt. She admoniſhed him to turn his eyes to the many thouſands beneath him, inſtead of gazing on the few who lived in pomp and ſplendor; and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of ſupplicating for riches and popularity, to pray for a virtuous mind, and a quiet ſtate, an unblame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able life, and a death full of good hopes.</p>
               <p>Finding him every day more and more compoſed and reſigned, though neither enamoured with her face, nor

The end obtained, my taſk is finiſhed and I now leave you, to go and give ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of my charge. Your brother, whoſe lot was Proſperity, and whoſe condition you ſo much envied, after having experienced the error of his choice, is at laſt releaſed by death from the moſt wretched of lives.

               <p>As ſhe pronounced theſe words, ſhe vaniſhed out of his ſight; but though her <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
