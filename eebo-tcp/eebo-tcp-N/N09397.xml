            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>I HAVE obſerved with much ſorrow and concern your neglect of the public worſhip of God and preaching of the Goſpel: As you thereby deprive me of the opportunity of addreſſing you from the pulpit, I am obliged to follow you into your private retirements: And I have choſen <hi>this</hi> method of application to your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, becauſe I would give you the advantage of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing and reflecting upon my ſolemn admonition, which you might be more likely to forget if I ſhould only diſcourſe with you in perſon, and becauſe I can in this method be quite free from the infirmities and interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions which often attend perſonal conferences.</p>

            <p>In love and tenderneſs to your ſoul, and under a ſenſe of the account which I muſt hereafter render to my Lord and Maſter, I will endeavour, in the firſt place, to ſhow you the <hi>nature</hi> of your ſin— then ſet forth its <hi>aggravations</hi>

to theſe holy deſires is the temper of your ſoul? You had rather indulge yourſelf in ſin, than take the leaſt ſtep to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward holineſs; you are content to let the precious waters of the ſanctuary run to waſte, rather than ſtoop to drink of them as they glide along: And thus your poor ſoul is making no improvement in divine knowledge; you are loving darkneſs rather than light, becauſe your deeds are evil; and if it ſhould ever pleaſe God to regenerate you by his holy ſpirit, what a ſmall ſtock of knowledge will you have to be a foundation for the exerciſe of grace, and the performance of duty in your Chriſtian courſe! I ſpeak of your regeneration only as a <hi>poſſible</hi> thing; but at the ſame time I ſolemnly warn you, from the word of God, that ſo long as you remain negligent of the means of grace, there is not the leaſt <hi>probability</hi> that God will ever change your heart, nor the leaſt encouragement for you to hope for his mercy.

The goſpel is nothing leſs than a revelation of mercy to apoſtate, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellious, ſelf-deſtroyed ſinners; yea, a revelation of the only poſſible way in which mercy can be ſhewed to them, conſiſtent with the eternal juſtice, truth and holineſs of the unchangeable GOD; it teaches us the only accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able way of worſhipping and ſerving him, by revealing to us a glorious Mediator, through whom our worſhip is to be directed to God, and by whoſe precious righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs we and our ſervices are rendered acceptable in his fight.

rams, and ten thouſand rivers of oil, would not have been an adequate offering; Lebanon would not have been ſufficient to burn, nor all the beaſts thereof for a burnt-offering; nothing leſs than the blood of the Son of God could redeem us from the curſe of the law, and open the way for our reſtoration to the favour of an offended De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity: And this, great as it was, Chriſt freely offered, for the love he bore to our guilty race; and God mercifully accepted his ſacrifice inſtead of our ſufferings, and is upon account thereof reconciling the world to himſelf, not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puting to men their treſpaſſes. This glorious work of redemption is a myſtery which the angels deſire to look into, 'tis the object of their admiration; 'tis a work which will engage the attention and excite the thankful praiſes of the redeemed throughout eternity; yea, 'tis a work which ſeems to be the <hi>center</hi> of all God's great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns from everlaſting to everlaſting. Chriſt, the great undertaker and finiſher of this illuſtrious work, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded it to be made known to all nations; and accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly his apoſtles went into all the world, publiſhing the truth, confirming their teſtimony with many miraculous works, and ſealing it with their blood. Innumerable is the company of martyrs, who, animated with the true ſpirit of Chriſtianity, perſevered in confeſſing their glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Lord, and vindicating the divine authority of his goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, in the midſt of the ſharpeſt tortures which the unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lenting cruelty of the moſt inhuman tyrants could invent; having come out of great tribulation, they have waſhed their robes, and made them white in the blood of the Lamb, and they are before the throne of God, and ſerve him day and night in his temple. Of ſuch importance did they eſteem the goſpel of Chriſt, that they did not even count their lives dear to themſelves, ſo that they might ſhew their love to it, and glorify their bleſſed Lord. And is it not of the ſame importance now? How can you bear then to make the compariſon between them and yourſelf, while you will not pay ſo much reſpect to that very goſpel as to hear it preached?</p>

You are ſet, perhaps, at the head of a family;

and you know how apt your children are to imitate what they ſee you do; you know they learn to ſpeak, to read, to perform all the common actions of life by imitation; and do they not learn ſin the ſame way? Is there not a natural, wicked diſpoſition in them, which eaſily leads them to follow whatever wicked examples are ſet before them? And when they ſee you living in the neglect of divine worſhip and ordinances, will they not be led to think them things of little or no importance? Should you take pains to teach them the nature and advantage of public worſhip, and ſend them to the houſe of God; yet will they not think you intend to deceive them, ſince it is plain, by your conduct, that you do not eſteem it a matter of any great importance to yourſelf.

It is a matter of ſo ſacred a nature, that it muſt not be trifled with, nor treated as indifferent; for it is either <hi>a ſavour of life unto life, or of death unto death,</hi> to all that know it. The worſhip of God, through the Mediator, is ſo high and honourable a priviledge allowed to guilty men, and the publick per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance thereof is a duty ſo reaſonable in itſelf, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducive to our own happineſs, and ſo expreſly required by God, that the neglect thereof is highly offenſive in his ſight, and merits a ſevere puniſhment at his hands.

To which I anſwer, that it muſt be a very extraordinary kind of offence to juſtify ſuch reſentment as this.

And how can you excuſe yourſelf in taking any other method to ſhew your diſpleaſure, while you have neglected <hi>this?</hi> Has not your preſent conduct a tendency rather to widen than cloſe the breach? And are you not thereby increaſing your guilt, by adding to your uncharitableneſs the ſin of neglecting divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitutions, and making one ſin an excuſe for another?</p>

You greatly wrong your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience to make <hi>that</hi> the cauſe of your negligence, while at the ſame time you diſobey its plaineſt dictates.

And do you think to cheat the all-ſeeing God with ſuch a miſerable ſhift as this? Reading is indeed a profitable way of ſpending holy time, and you have the beſt examples of it in ſcripture: but what do you find to countenance you in omitting the duty of hearing, for the ſake of reading? You might eaſily find time for read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the ſabbath, before and after the public ſervice; and you might have ſome reaſon to expect God's bleſſing upon your reading, if you attended the duty of hearing alſo. But now you make your compliance with one duty an excuſe for your neglect of another; as if God required more of you than he gives you time to perform. Is not this a bold reflection upon him?

whoſe fault it is, that any, who attend the means of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtruction, reap no benefit; is the blame to be charged on the duty itſelf, on the word preached, on him that preaches it, on him that has commanded it to be preached, or on the <hi>hearers?</hi> I ſuppoſe your modeſty will fix it on the hearers; then is it not ridiculous to argue thus,—<q>becauſe ſome, who attend their duty in a cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tomary manner, are to blame for not getting that good which they might, therefore I will not attend mine at all?</q> With the ſame propriety might you argue,

Would not you juſtly be called a <hi>fool,</hi> if you ſhould come to ſuch a concluſion? And why will you not take as much care of your ſoul as of your body? 'Tis true, if you attend the public exerciſes of religion with ſuch a careleſs, unprepared heart as thoſe whom you blame, you will doubtleſs be as unprofitable an hearer as they; but this is not what I am urging you to; I would have you come with a ſerious mind, with a ſincere deſire of reaping benefit, with a meek and teachable diſpoſition; and when you are come, attend with care and diligence, applying the truths of God's word to your own conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and begging the influences of the divine ſpirit to render theſe means effectual.

And if any are really profited by their attendance on this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine inſtitution, it is a far greater argument to urge your compliance with your duty, than the contrary is in favour of your neglect. It is much to be wiſhed, tho' hardly to be expected, that all who attend the public ſervice of God ſhould gain equal benefit thereby: The word preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will be a ſavour of life unto life to ſome, and of death unto death to others; but you are greatly miſtaken if you imagine yourſelf not ſo guilty in the ſight of God, as they that outwardly attend their duty, and yet are not benefited by it; you have the ſame advantages, the ſame

talent is committed to you both; and if you are both found to have miſimproved it, you will be reckoned with alike; nor can you expect to eſcape the judgment of thoſe that wilfully reject the ſalvation offered in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, for you cannot ſay that you do not know your Maſter's will, in ſome meaſure; and if you keep your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ignorant of any part of it, by your neglect of the means of inſtruction, the fault is wholly your own: Wilful ignorance of duty is wilful neglect of duty, and deſerves the ſame puniſhment.</p>

Imagine yourſelf now laid on a bed of ſickneſs, and your life deſpaired of, your ſoul juſt going into the eternal world, to appear before the bar of God, and give up an account of the deeds done in the body: And now aſk your own conſcience, whether you can venture to ſtand the trial upon the ſame plea that has hitherto ſatisfied you? Would you dare to tell the Searcher of Hearts, that you have neglected his ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn worſhip, and the means of ſalvation, which he has graciouſly afforded you,

How incomparably mean and little do all theſe evaſions appear, when viewed in this Light; and I appeal to your conſcience, whether this is not the true light that they ought to be vie<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
