            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <note n="(g)" place="bottom">The Caſe of Mr. <hi>Rhodes</hi> is very ſingular: He was of a mean Birth and Occupation, but, upon the unexpected falling of many Lives, became ſuddenly poſſeſſed of an Eſtate of above Four Hundred Pounds a Year; and, to ſerve the Brethren, after many Importunities, he was induced to diſpoſe of it. Mr. <hi>Lee,</hi> the Banker, purchaſed it, and Meſſ. <hi>Freeman</hi> and <hi>Grace</hi> received Six Thouſand Pounds of the Money towards what was due to them. Beſides this, Mr. <hi>Rhodes</hi> was bound for many Thouſands more. This made him very uneaſy, and fearing the Conſequence, he one Afternoon, about ten Weeks ago, ſtole an Interview with two ſingle Brethren, and beſeeched them for Chriſt's ſake to let him have Twenty-five Pounds, for the Payment of which he left them his Watch, Bureau, Horſe and Saddle. He then took his Leave, ſaying, in all Probability he ſhould never ſee them any more; and having nothing to ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>Theſe are but a few Inſtances, <hi>my Lord,</hi> amongſt many, indeed, too, too many, that might be given. The Brethren's Agents, and thoſe concerned with them, can beſt tell what horrid Equivocations, Untruths, and low Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifices, have been made uſe of to procure Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, at high Intereſts, wherever it was to be had, in order to keep up the Brethren's Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit in that poor, lame Manner it has been kept up for a conſiderable Time. Was the whole Scene to be opened, I believe every one would be of Opinion that ſuch an eccle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiaſtical Project never was heard of before in any Part of his Majeſty's Dominions.</p>

            <p>Surely, the LORD of Lords, whoſe Eyes are like a Flame of Fire, and who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires Truth in the inward Parts, will one Day or other viſit for theſe Things, by bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Light the hidden Things of Darkneſs, and thereby making manifeſt the Counſels of the Hearts.</p>
            <p>I need not inform <hi>your Lordſhip</hi> that <hi>Babels</hi> are generally ſuffered to be built pretty high, before GOD comes down to confound the Language of the Builders. If Knaves are employed, (as commonly they are) GOD's Honour is concerned to diſcover them; and if any of his own Children are undeſignedly drawn in, (which is frequently the Caſe) He who hath promiſed not to ſuffer them to be tempted above what they are able to bear, will in Mercy, ſome Way or other, rebuke the Tempter, and make a Way for them to eſcape. It is true, this, in public Concerns, may ſometimes expoſe them to a little worldly Contempt, and, for a While, they may ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly be cruſhed under the Rubbiſh of the fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Fabric; but even this ſhall work together for their Good; and happy will it be for them, if, after all, they at length learn this important Leſſon, viz. <hi>That it is dangerous, upon any Pretence whatſoever, to go from the
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:007136_0015_102AFD2A8417DA00"/>
written Word, or give up their Conſciences to the Guidance of my Man, or Body of Men under Heaven.</hi> This, <hi>your Lordſhip</hi> well knows, is what weak and unſtable Souls are too apt to do, and artful and deſigning Men, who are fond of Power, eſpecially if naturally they are of an am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious Turn of Mind, eaſily catch at the pleaſing Bait. But Honeſty, <hi>my Lord,</hi> will be found to be the beſt Policy after all: And therefore God forbid that any who call themſelves the Followers of the Lamb ſhould glory in any thing ſave the Croſs of CHRIST.</p>
            <p>At preſent I ſhall add no more, but earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaying <hi>Amen</hi> to that Part of the Brethren's <hi>Litany,</hi> however exceptionable in other Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects, <hi>From untimely Projects, and from un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happily becoming great, keep us our good Lord and God</hi>; and as heartily praying, that the glorious JESUS may proſper all that is Right, and give Grace to correct and amend all that is Wrong among all his People of all Denominations; I ſubſcribe myſelf,</p>
