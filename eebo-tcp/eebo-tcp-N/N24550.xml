            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>FOR what purpose, fellow-citizens are we assembled? For no less than the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memoration of that illustrious period, when the dawning genius of America, burst through the gloom that overspread its po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical horizon; and exhibited to the world, that splendid prologue to its future greatness, the declaration of Independence.</p>
            <p>The bounded imaginations of the satel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites of tyranny, could not calculate on such an event; the daring measure aston<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ished their contracted hearts: it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served for Americans alone, to plan, and to execute so noble a project.</p>
            <p>Let us contemplate, with seriousness, the causes of this important event; im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant to us, to Europe and posterity.</p>
            <p>Tyranny, and superstition, uniting their corrupted streams, had for ages overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med the verdant plains of Europe; except here and there a free town, or petty repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, emerging like an island in the ocean;

                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>eving the disgusted eye of sympathetic philanthropy.</p>
            <p>Our fore-fathers in Britain, a hardy race, for centuries, with various success, stemmed this devastating torrent; resisting as became freemen, the bold encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of prerogative, and the more insidi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous attempts o<gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The best institutions may be perverted, the purest principles misconstrued; or cruelty and persecution, had never been decorated with the mild robe of christian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.—</p>
            <p>The manly spirit of our ancestors re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted at the fulsome ceremonies of <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="1 letter">

            <p>We are all acquainted with the sequel.</p>
            <p>The first settlers of this country, arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, after encountering incredible hardships and difficulties at Plymouth, in New-En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland; there with the most unexampled fortitude and perseverance, they with the loss of half their numbers, effected a set<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement

               </gap> importance. Illustrious, independent souls! Could you have foreseen the high destinies of your country, the pleasing prospect had alleviated your cares, soothed your anxie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and softened your rugged labors in the wilderness! But your virtues are reward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by that impartial Being who could a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone form a just estimate of your merits, and posterity will remember you with gratitude.</p>
            <p>Their virtues were the foundation of our happiness, their prudence of our pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity. Recently escaped from the fangs of oppression, they were naturally averse to, and abhorred every species of tyranny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> united closely by their mutual wants, dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers and distresses, benevolence was neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary. Impelled by their rigid sate to the most circumspect oeconomy, and unabating industry, the vices of the indolent and lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urious were unknown amongst them:—their children copied the fair examples, and industry, hospitality and frugality were characteristics of their offspring. Propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etors of the soil cleared by their own la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, no grinding landlord extorted with unrelenting severity an unequal share of the fruits of their exertions. No prepos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:032496_0005_0FF2F875992BF840"/>
hereditary distinctions insulted their understanding, and impressed them with artificial ideas of dignity. Education be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing almost equally diffused amongst them, and being, from the nature of their situa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, obliged to turn their minds to va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious objects; they acquired a degree of acuteness and penetration peculiar to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, and utterly unknown to the yeo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manry of Europe. Being distant from the principal seat of government, they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came early accustomed to the regulation of their internal affairs; and chose their provincial legislators from amongst the most virtuous and enlightened of their neighbors; so that in fact, they were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publicans in principle, in practice, and by habit, long before they burst the bonds of usurpation, and assumed an elevation sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion among the nations of the earth.</p>
            <p>The population of the colonies encreased beyond the most sanguine expectations; aided by numerous emigrations from Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, they advanced by rapid strides to importance; and soon became a consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able mart for the manufactures of Britain; who received their produce in return, mutually enriching each other. They voluntarily assisted the Mother Country in a severe conflict with France, and the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:032496_0006_0FF2F8783667EEC8"/>
Colonial and Britannic troops, in friendly unison, vanquished the legions, and crush<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the aspiring hopes of the House of Bourbon.</p>
            <p>Had Britain consulted her true interest she had been tenaciously cautious of break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this to her so necessary a connexion. But the short sighted councils of tyranny, accelerated their own disgrace. For this generous assistance, for this noble co-ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, how were we rewarded? Inflated with wealth and prosperity, proud of her victories, intoxicated with success, a success to which we had so largely contributed, discovering by the effectiveness of our assistance the strength of our resources, she determined to force from us the means of supporting her overgrown importance; in the most unconstitutional manner, she determined by her parliament to tax the colonies.</p>
            <p>The moderation, with which we resisted her first unjust attempts to subjugate us, are as notorious as her haughty perseve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in urging her despotic claims.—Blinded by the artful insinuations of an ignorant, infatuated and flagitious minis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, deaf to the energetic remonstrances of a Chatham, a Burke, a Fox, and a Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re; who in vain attempted to rend the
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032496_0007_0FF2F879CD061370"/>
film of prejudice from the eyes of Britain. The brilliancy of wit, the fertility of geni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>us, the subtilty of logic, the solidity of reason, though fighting under the banner of justice, were shamefully defeated. The javelin of truth fell blunted from the shield of corruption, who uplifting her remorse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less arm, severed the fraternal ties that bound us together.</p>
            <p>
               <q>Reiterated insults, roused at length the dormant spirit of America; who appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the God of battles, sustained alone, and unsupported, the attacks of a great and powerful nation, the mistress of the ocean: from the commencement of the glorious struggle, to the capture of Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne, who led on its best appointed ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. Astonishing spectacle! a band of husbandmen, without any discipline, but the love of order, animated by the spirit of liberty and independence, warmed by patriotism, impelled by honor, instigated by sublime domestic affection, feeling for posterity, erected their daring crests against the proud standard of oppression, and no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly prevailed.</q>
            </p>
            <p>From this period, the affairs of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica assumed a promising aspect, aided by the victorious arms of France, and guided by the unerring councils of that accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished

general, consummate statesman, and most virtuous citizen, the far famed Washington; the surrender of a second British army at York-Town, completed our triumph.</p>
            <p>It were superfluous, to detail with his<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical minuteness, the progress of the war. The most important events are im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed on all our memories, the beneficial effects are felt by all.</p>
            <p>Many of you, doubtless, were actors in the magnificent drama, many of you have bled in the awful cause. Ye firm support<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of our rights, ye bulwarks of liberty; the grateful remembrance of your <gap reason="illegible: under-inked" extent="3 letters">

Even the perfidious defection of your degenerate brethren, who under the flimsy veil of loyalty, endeavored to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal the blackness of their polluted hearts, was of no avail.</p>
            <p>The genius of America, like the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jestic oak, which derives stability from the whirlwind, and thrives in the storm; rose superior to the shocks of fortune, and strengthened in adversity.</p>
            <p>France caught the sparks of liberty on the plains of America, which have kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled a conflagration, that has dazzled the universe; and made the despots of Europe tremble on their thrones: they combined indeed, to smother the rising flame, but instead of quenching, have fanned the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring fire; that threatens to consume them.</p>
            <p>The leaders of that surprising revolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, deeming the rude rabble of France, unfit, as yet, to bear the full glare of light, were for softening it with a monarchie tint; and formed the incongruous project

            <p>Amongst the principal of these, we count the illustrious and unfortunate La Fayette; whose unmerited sufferings are regretted by us all, whose virtues are too well known to derive lustre from eulogi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um.

            <p>The revolution in this country, has hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily produced the most beneficial effects; we had not such difficulties to contend with as our brethren in France; brethren I say, for I still hope, that our unhappy differences may, through the wisdom and moderation of our rulers be adjusted, and our ancient friendship renewed.</p>
            <p>We were predisposed by habit and education for the simplicity of a republic, they were sunk in ignorance and supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they passed abruptly from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme of despotism to the most wanton li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiousness. We had not yet felt the rod of oppression, although it was sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended over our heads.</p>
            <p>Hence, after experiencing the ill ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of an inefficient disjointed govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we adopted with almost perfect u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanimity, and without the least tumult, our present happy system; which unites
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:032496_0013_0FF2F88B605530F0"/>
the vigor of the monarchic, the wisdom of the aristocratic, and the purity of the democratic forms without their incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience: wisely placing at the head of our affairs, the well tried Washington, who hath conducted their administration in a manner worthy of himself, and raised his grateful country to a pitch of unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected prosperity: May he experience in his beloved retreat but half the happiness he hath conferred on us, and ample indeed will be his recompence!</p>
            <p>On the magnanimous resignation of that truly great man, whose merits are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove praise; we sagaciously selected from the band of patriots, for the two first of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices of government, distinguished charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters worthy of their respective trusts; who bore a conspicuous share in the so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn transaction we are assembled to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>memorate. One was a distinguished ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate for the glorious measure, the other actually drew up the declaration of Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence itself.</p>
            <p>With such directors at the helm, we may fairly trust that the honor and interest of America will not be trifled with. In the mean time, let us not be lulled into a fatal security, but watch with a jealous eye over that inestimable prerogative of

            <p>And may the Almighty shield with his protecting arm the opening prospects of America.</p>
