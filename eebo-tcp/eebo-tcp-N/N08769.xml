            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>DEATH is the common lot of all a men. Whether we ſuſtain a public, or private character in life, we ſhall, in a little time, go the way whence we ſhall not return. And the thought, that we muſt certainly and ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:011207_0004_0F862C72F1C0F810"/>
leave this preſent world, is powerfully adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to awaken our powers, and excite us to dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in doing the work that is reſpectively aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned us, in the providence of God. Said our bleſſed Saviour, while on earth, "I muſt work the work of him that ſent me." And why? the reaſon follows in the next words, "for the night cometh, wherein no man can work." To the like purpoſe, it was the reſolution of the apoſtle Peter, in my text, to be ever diligent in his duty, as a miniſter of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and upon this motive, "knowing that ſhortly I muſt put off this my tabernacle."</p>
            <p>HE ſpake theſe words with a more imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate referrence to himſelf: But they are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly applicable to all, whom it has pleaſed God to entruſt with the miniſtry of the goſpel of his Son Jeſus Chriſt. And in this accommodated view, the two following things are obſervable in them.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THE duty of goſpel miniſters, intimated in thoſe words, "I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of theſe things."</p>
            <p n="2">II. THE motive by which this duty is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced; "knowing that ſhortly I muſt put off this my tabernacle, as our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath ſhewed me."</p>
            <p>ACCORDINGLY, theſe are the particulars to employ your thoughts, and then to be applied to the preſent occaſion.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:011207_0005_0F862C73B2699420"/>I. THE firſt thing obſervable in the text is, the duty of goſpel miniſters; ſuggeſted in thoſe words, "I will not be negligent to put you always in remembrance of theſe things; though ye know them, and be eſtabliſhed in the preſent truth: Yea, I think it meet, as long as I am in this tabernacle, to ſtir you up by putting you in remembrance."</p>
            <p>THE perſons, to whom the apoſtle Peter was now writing, had, for a conſiderable time, made a profeſſion of the chriſtian faith; for which reaſon, he was rather concerned to refreſh their minds with a "remembrance of the things which they knew already," than to tickle their ears with new notions which they had never heard of before. Accordingly, having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted them, in the foregoing part of this chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, not to reſt ſatisfied with their having "faith" in the goſpel revelation, but to "give diligence to add to their faith, virtue, and knowledge, and temperance, and patience and godlineſs, and brotherly kindneſs, and charity," and to "abound" in theſe graces; aſſuring them "that ſo entrance ſhould be miniſtred to them abundantly into the everlaſting kingdom of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt:" I ſay, having thus exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted them, he reſolves in the words of the text now under conſideration, to repeat his exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations "to theſe things;" and to go on ſo doing "as long as he lived," not allowing him ſelf to be ever "negligent" to put them in mind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of ſuch important points, in the buſineſs of their ſalvation. Not that he hereby intended to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011207_0006_0F862C7466679E88"/>
that they were ignorant of theſe great truths of religion: He rather ſuppoſed they were "knowing" in them; yea, that they were "well eſtabliſhed" in the faith of them. But yet, he judged it "meet" to reiterate the enforcement of theſe truths; frequently bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to their "remembrance," and, by this means, keeping them, as it were, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually preſent in their minds for their ſpiritual advantage.</p>
            <p>AND we may herefrom learn much of the duty of the preſent miniſters of the goſpel. They have to do chiefly with thoſe, who may reaſonably be ſuppoſed to be well inſtructed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready in the principles and duties of chriſtianity. And their buſineſs is, not to gratify their cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity, by telling them new and ſtrange things; but to "ſtir up their minds" by way of recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection; to revive in their memories the actual preſence of old truths, and to do it in ſuch a manner as that they may, if poſſible, be quickened and excited by them to the purpoſes of ſpiritual edification.</p>
            <p>IT may poſſibly be an objection with ſome, to giving their attendance on the word publick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preached, that they ſhall be inſtructed in nothing new. The preacher, ſay they, will have nothing to ſay but what has been often ſaid already. And why ſhould we trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble our ſelves to go to hear that, which we have heard, and know before?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:011207_0007_0F862C752F32E2C0"/>THE apoſtle Peter did not think there was any weight in objections of this kind. For he ſpake very preſſingly to the gentile chriſtians concerning the things, which they "knew al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready;" yea, and he reſolved to go on repeating "theſe things," though they were "eſtabliſhed" in the belief them, as long as he lived.</p>
            <p>AND it is, in itſelf, a "meet," fit thing, that mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters ſhould repeatedly call people's attention to the things which they "already know" For they really need to have the great truths of God, and religion, urged upon them by reiterated exhortations. Tis not enough, that they are ſpeculatively acquainted with goſpel doctrines; but theſe muſt be made preſent to their minds, by a frequent and continued "ſtirring up" of your memories: Otherwiſe, though they "know them," they will receive little ſpiritual benefit from them. For, tis worthy of our no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, the truths of religion, however great and important, can operate upon men, to the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of correſponding effects, in no way but by their preſence in the mind, and its being actually employed in exerciſing its thoughts, with reference to them. And in order to this, it is highly proper, in true reaſon, that they ſhould be frequently made thus preſent by the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the goſpel. Many people would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, it may be, ſcarce ever attend to thoſe things which they knew to be truths, and truths too of the greateſt importance. For however apt men may be to keep in mind the things that concern their outward, and temporal welfare,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011207_0008_0F862C75F496EBD0"/>
they are certainly very forgetful of thoſe, which relate to their ſouls, and their ſpiritual and ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting welfare. It is therefore no ſmall part of the work, and duty, of goſpel miniſters, to bring the great truths of chriſtianity frequently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the view of their people; calling their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to them, and repeatedly fixing their thoughts upon them, if poſſibly they may have a ſutable operation upon their hearts and lives.</p>
            <p>THIS was certainly the practice of the apoſtles of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. The apoſtle Peter, in my text, "thought it meet" to enforce the ſame truths upon the chriſtians he was concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with, and to be "always diligent" herein. And the apoſtle Paul applies to the chriſtians at Philippi, in ſuch language as that, (Phil. iii.1.) "Brethren to write the ſame things to you, to me indeed is not grievous, but for you it is ſafe." And our Savior's character of a wiſe, and faithful ſteward of the miſteries of the goſpel is, "that he brings out of his treaſure things that are old as well as new," Matt. xiii.52. And thus our Savior did himſelf. If we look over the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of his preaching, as they are recorded in the four goſpels, we ſhall find that he often urged upon his hearers "the things pertaining to the kingdom of God;" reiterating his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions from time to time, and refreſhing their memories by calling them to attend to the "ſame truths;" and all, that He might faſten them in their hearts, ſo as to be powerful prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of action.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:011207_0009_0F862C76AF1928D0"/>TIS true, our Savior, in his day, and his apoſtles in theirs, endeavoured to render the "ſame truths" agreable, by the various man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner in which they propoſed and urged them. Hence the many parables in which our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or has ſet forth the ſame divine truths. And hence the many ſimilies and metaphors, that are uſed to expreſs the ſame thoughts, both by our Lord himſelf, and his apoſtles after him.</p>
            <p>THOSE, who are entruſted with the care of ſouls, would do well to place their maſter, and his apoſtles, before their view, and to copy after the pattern they have ſet them. It is proper, I may rather ſay neceſſary, we ſhould ſay the "ſame things", repeating them over and over again; yet, we ſhould endeavour to do this, not in a round of the ſame words, but by an agrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble variety in phraſe, metaphor, and arange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of thought. It ſhould be our ſtudy to "find out acceptable words", ſo to expreſs our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves as that, what we deliver may be handed to our people in a manner as little tedious, and as well-pleaſing as may be. And we ſhall now, in the beſt adapted way, lay our ſelves out to preach to them ſo as that, if it be not owing to themſelves, they may be profited, even when their attention is called to thoſe truths, in point of faith or practice, which they knew before, and had been often inculcated on them.—But I muſt proceed to the</p>
            <p n="2">II. SECOND thing obſervable in my text, and this is, the motive by which the duty mentioned
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011207_0010_0F862C7778F52D40"/>
is enforced. It is contained in thoſe words, "knowing that ſhortly I muſt put off this my ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bernacle, as our Lord Jeſus Chriſt hath ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me."</p>
            <p>THE apoſtle, you obſerve, here ſpeaks of his body figuratively; calling it "his tent, or tabernacle:" and with great propriety and beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. For the human body is, in its preſent con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, a frail feeble ſtructure, eaſily taken down, and deſigned but for a ſhort continuance. We are "pilgrims and ſtrangers here on earth, as were all our fathers before us", and dwell in tents of clay, from which we ſhall ſoon be removed; though bleſſed be the God of all grace, the time is coming, when theſe our "vile bodies" ſhall, if we are "faithful to the death," be faſhioned into fixed, durable, glorious buildings, "houſes not made with hands, eternal in the heavens."</p>
            <p>"PUTTING off" a garment is a common mode of diction; but we do not ſpeak of "putting off" a tent. "Taking it down, or going out of it," is the uſual form of expreſſion. Yet the Holy Ghoſt has been pleaſed, while comparing the body to a tabernacle, to conſider death as "putting off" one's cloths; blending together different metaphors: unleſs it ſhould be ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, which, perhaps, is the truth, that the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal word (apotheſis) here tranſlated "putting off," might as properly be rendered "laying aſide", "laying down," as a thing to be uſed no more; and then there will be no varying of figures.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:011207_0011_0F862C7835E6A908"/>THE apoſtle ſays, "he knew that he ſhould lay aſide his tabernacle," or, in other words, that he ſhould die. Nor could he have been igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of this moſt certain truth. "The living know that they ſhall die." They know it from the appointment of God, which is of univerſal extent; taking in the whole human race, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out exception or limitation. And they knew it alſo from the univerſal empire of death over all the ſons and daughters of Adam, whether rich or poor, wiſe or fooliſh; or however diſcrimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from each other by their ſtations in life.</p>
            <p>HE adds, that he knew that he ſhould "SHORT<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>LY lay aſide his tabernacle, as our Lord Jeſus Chriſt had ſhewed him." Some of the ancient fathers have ſaid, that the preciſe time of his death, which was now near at hand, was made known to him by a viſion from heaven; and that, in this way, he knew from Chriſt, that his continuance here would be "ſhort." But this is nothing more than mere conjecture. Tis true, God acquainted Moſes with the approach of his death, and made it certain to the apoſtle Paul that he ſhould ſoon be martyred. And he might, by viſion, or a voice from heaven, or in ſome other way, reveal it to Peter that he ſhould "ſhortly lay aſide his earthly tabernacle." But there is no need of any ſuch ſuppoſition. And tis moſt probable, he collected the near approach of his death from thoſe words, in John xxi 18.19. which our Lord ſpake to him, while he dwelt in fleſh. "Verily, verily, I ſay unto thee, when thou waſt young, thou girdedſt thy ſelf, and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011207_0012_0F862C78E826A7F0"/>
walkedſt whither thou wouldeſt; but when thou ſhalt be old, thou ſhalt ſtretch forth thy hands, and another ſhall gird thee, and carry thee whi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou wouldeſt not". The inſpired evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geliſt adds hereupon, in the following verſe, "This ſpake he (that is Jeſus) ſignifying by what death he ſhould glorify God". Tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, and very obviouſly ſo, from thoſe words of our Lord to Peter, that he ſhould die a martyr in his cauſe, when he was grown old; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now a man advanced in age, he "knew" by what "our Lord Jeſus Chriſt had ſhewed him," many years before, that he muſt "ſhortly" die. He firmly believed what he had been told by his Lord, and collected herefrom that the time of his departure was at hand, that he ſhould "ſhortly" be "girded," and carried to execution for his adherence to the religion of Jeſus. And that he did, according to this prediction of Chriſt, ſuffer martyrdom, and about the time that he here ſays he "knew" he ſhould, we have the teſtimony of Clement of Rome, of Lactan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tius, Euſebius, and others.</p>
            <p>THE compoſure of mind, the truly chriſtian fortitude, with which he here ſpeaks of his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching death, is worthy of ſpecial notice. He was, in the firſt days of his diſcipleſhip, ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully intimidated in a time of danger; inſomuch that, through the influence of fear, he was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come to "deny his Lord," affirming with great vehemency, "I know not the man." But, being recovered by repentance, and growing "ſtrong in faith," and in the grace that is in Chriſt
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011207_0013_0F862C79A35BC200"/>
Jeſus," he became fearleſs of death, yea, of death by the violence of perſecutors; as knowing the truth of chriſtianity, and that, by quitting his tabernacle on earth, for the ſake of his maſter and ſavior, he ſhould be fixed in a building of God that would be gloriouſly incapable of being ever pulled down by men, or devils.</p>
            <p>INSTEAD of being diſcouraged, or affrightened, at the knowledge of the nearneſs of his death, and by the hands of violence, he is rather influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced and quickened to greater zeal and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence in preſſing important, though well-known, truths. He eſteemed the "ſhortneſs" of his continuance in life a cogent reaſon, why he ſhould be more laboriouſly active, if poſſible, than ever, in urging upon the chriſtians he had opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to preach to, a due regard to the religion of Jeſus, they had been already inſtructed in. And in the doing of this, he mentions that tender and affecting circumſtance, "his being to die ſhortly", becauſe the words of a dying friend are won't ordinarily to come with greater force, and to make the deepeſt impreſſion on the mind.</p>
            <p>AND the conſideration of the "ſhortneſs" of the time he had to live excited his zeal to "write" as well as to preach, that he might promote the intereſt of the kingdom of Chriſt. So we read in the verſe immediately following the text, "moreover, I will endeavour that you may be able, after my deceaſe, to have theſe things al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in remembrance." Theſe things he would endeavour they ſhould "always have in remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance,"
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:011207_0014_0F862C7C7B94AB98"/>
were, the neceſſity of practiſing the virtues of the chriſtian life, mentioned, v.5. and onwards; and that, if they did ſo, they ſhould "have an abundant entrance into God's ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting kingdom." More important truths they could not remember. "Theſe things" the apoſtle Peter had preached; and, not thinking this ſufficient, he committed them to writing in the two epiſtles that go under his name, that they might be remembered after he was dead and gone. As one juſtly obſerves, "He thought writing "much preferable to oral tradition, for preſerving the exact knowledge and remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of truths of the laſt conſequence. And he judged well. For what have we of certainty from "oral tradition?" whereas theſe two epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles have already continued above 1600 years, and are as able to put us "in remembrance of theſe things," as ever they were to do the like to chriſtians of former ages. And I doubt not but they will continue to the end of the world, and be of ſervice, wherever they are carefully attended to". The ſame excellent author adds, thoſe who are heartily concerned for truth and purity, will do all they can to promote them while living, and that truth and righteouſneſs may continue in the world when they are in their grave. St. Peter had the ſame regard for the chriſtian church, that Laelius expreſſed for the common-wealth, when he ſaid, "I have no leſs concern for the common-wealth after my death, than for its proſperity at this preſent time."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:011207_0015_0F862C7F13C17AD8"/>But the "motive" in my text, is not peculiar to the apoſtle Peter. It is adapted, in its nature, to operate powerfully upon all whom it has pleaſed God to put into the miniſtry. Tis true, we do not "know," the ſame way in which Peter did, that we ſhall "ſhortly lay aſide theſe our tabernacles"; we may not preſume to ſay, the time of our removal to another world has been "revealed" to us. We know not the day, or hour, or indeed the general period of life, when our Lord will call for us. But this notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, we certainly know, becauſe "our Lord Jeſus Chriſt," in the ſacred books of ſcripture, "has ſhewed us," that our continuance here is ſhort; that, at longeſt, it will not be long, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the places that now know us will know us no more. Says the apoſtle Paul, ſpeaking in the name of Chriſt, and as authoriſed by him, "the time is ſhort." And this is the exact truth, ſhould our time be protracted to the utmoſt length of human life. The ſacred penmen, who wrote as they were influenced and guided by the Spirit of Jeſus Chriſt, are repeatedly expreſs in their repreſentations of the brevity of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance here on earth; and to impreſs our minds with a juſt and deep ſenſe of it, they not only affirm it as a truth, but make uſe of the ſtrongeſt metaphors to convey it to us in the moſt ſtriking manner. They compare the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of life here to "a ſhadow, which abideth not;" and to "a vapor, which appeareth for a little while, and then vaniſheth away." They reſemble the ſpeed with which our days paſs away to the haſte of "a riding poſt;" to the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011207_0016_0F862C7FA8554970"/>
"ſwift motion of a ſhip under ſail;" yea, to the much ſwifter motion of an "eagle in her flight towards her prey." With ſuch ſpeed do we paſs from one period of life to another, till life comes to an end, and we are here no more. Should "the days of our years" extend to "threeſcore years and ten; yea, ſhould they, "by reaſon of ſtrength," reach to "foreſcore years;" yet would they "ſoon be cut off," they would ſpend away "as a tale that is told", as the language is in the 90th Pſalm.</p>
            <p>WHAT more powerful motive, now, can be laid before goſpel-miniſters, to engage their concern, and influence their endeavours, to ſtir up their people to "keep in remembrance" the great things that pertain to the kingdom of God, and of Jeſus Chriſt, they may have been already inſtructed in? Muſt we "ſhortly" go out of theſe earthly tabernacles? Has "our Lord Jeſus Chriſt," by the moſt lively and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting deſcriptions, "ſhewed us," that our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance here will be but a little while, at lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt? Oh! how can we, in this view of life, idle away our days in ſloth, or that which is worſe; neglecting to keep preſent in our minds, and in the minds of our people, the momentous truths of God and religion! Ought we not rather to be zealous, active, conſtant and diligent, in doing the work that is proper to our office as the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of Jeſus Chriſt? Is not this infinitely rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable? Can any thing more important be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to us, and urged upon us? Is not the honor of God, the intereſt of Chriſt, and our own eternal well being nearly and cloſely connected
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011207_0017_0F862C8067581138"/>
herewith? Is not Chriſt our Judge, as well as maſter? And will he not, when he "appears a ſecond time in his own glory, and in his fathers, with the holy angels," reckon with us for our conduct in the miniſterial life? We ſhall aſſuredly be called to render an account of the improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the great truſt that has been committed to us. And if we have approved our ſelves "faithful to the death," that is the language, in which our Lord will ſay to us, in the audience of the general aſſembly of angels and men, "well done, good and faithful ſervants, enter ye into the joy of your Lord:" But if we have loit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered away our days in ſloth and negligence, that will be our awful doom, from his mouth, "caſt ye the unprofitable ſervant into outer darkneſs; there ſhall be weeping, and gnaſhing of teeth."</p>
            <p>THUS goſpel miniſters, in common, "know," by what "our Lord Jeſus Chriſt has ſhewed them," that they ſhall "ſhortly lay aſide theſe their tabernacles," from whence they ſhould be excited to the moſt vigorous exertions in working the work which has been committed to them as their ſpecial charge. But there are ſome, among the miniſters of Chriſt, to whom he is "ſhewing" that they will ſtill more ſhortly leave theſe "houſes of clay," whoſe "foundation is in the duſt." So feeble is their make, ſo weak their conſtitution, and ſo many the infirmities they are groaning under, that it is evidently made known to them, that they ſhall not abide long in the fleſh." And this is eminently the caſe of thoſe, who are ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced in years, approaching towards, or having
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011207_0018_0F862C81BB1A6AB8"/>
already reached, the general period, the wiſdom of God has fixed for the duration of life. As for ſuch, they know, becauſe it has been "ſhewed" to them by the revelation of Jeſus Chriſt, that the time of their departure is at hand. They are ignorant, it is true, of the preciſe time, when they muſt leave this preſent world; but they certainly know, in general, that "the earthly houſe of their tabernacle" will ſhortly, very ſhortly, "be diſſolved". And what a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful motive is this to make them diligent and faithful in "ſtirring up" their people, by "put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting them in remembrance" of the great and neceſſary truths of chriſtianity? Theſe ought to have a moſt lively and affecting preſence in their own minds. Their nearneſs to another world renders it eminently proper, I may ſay abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly neceſſary. And if they have upon their own minds an impreſſive ſenſe of the infinite impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the great truths of God and religion, how can it be but that they ſhould zealouſly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to awaken, and keep alive, in the minds of their people, the like ſerious and affecting ſenſe of theſe things? They muſt now beſtir themſelves, or they never will. For their time is ſhort. In a little while, at longeſt, their ſun will ſet, and the night come on, when they can no more employ themſelves in ſervices for their own ſouls, or the ſouls of thoſe whom Chriſt has made their peculiar charge. They ſhould therefore "do with their might whatſoever their hands find to do;" remembring, that there is "no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdom in the grave, whither they are going," and where they will ſhortly be laid.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:011207_0019_0F862C825333B1F8"/>THIS I would conſider as particularly applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to my ſelf. I am now approaching towards the time, beyond which "the Lord Jeſus Chriſt has ſhewed me" in the ſacred books, that I cannot dwell in this my fleſhly tabernacle, unleſs I had "great ſtrength," which I know I have not. It was far from my thoughts, ſome years ago, that I ſhould have lived to bear a part in that ſpecial ſervice, which may be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected this day. But, having obtained help from God, I am continued to you, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all my unworthineſs and ſinfulneſs, and with ſome ability, according to the meaſure of the gift of grace beſtowed on me, to go on with the Lord's work among you. May a ſenſe of his great goodneſs ſutably <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ect my heart! And may I from the conſideration, that I ſhall ſhortly be called from you, be powerfully conſtrained to the greateſt zeal, activity, diligence, and fidelity in my miniſterial labor for the good of your ſouls. Brethren, "pray for me." Your ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing will be for your own advantage, as well as mine. If the good God, in anſwer to your conſtant, fervent ſupplications before his mercy-ſeat in heaven, ſhall be pleaſed to be preſent with me, with the aids of his grace, enabling me to be faithful; at the ſame time, ſucceeding my faithful endeavours, ſo as that the goſpel may have its ſaving effect upon you, I ſhall then, of the abounding mercy of God, through the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toning merit of the great Redeemer, receive the "crown of life;" and you will be "my crown and joy," in the day of the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt "without ſin unto ſalvation."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:011207_0020_0F862C82C8CB4C08"/>AND I would the rather "beſeech you, for the Lord Jeſus Chriſt's ſake, and for the love of the Spirit, to ſtrive together with me in your prayers to God for me", as it has ſeemed good to the alwiſe, righteous, and holy ſovereign of the world, to take to himſelf, by ſudden death, "my companion, and fellow-laborer, in the kingdom, and patience of Jeſus Chriſt".</p>
            <p>HAD he been permitted to live till the 23d of Oct. next, we ſhould have continued your colleague Paſtors the full ſpace of forty two years. It can't be ſuppoſed, I ſhould want an inclination to do juſtice to the memory of one to whom I have been ſo long, and ſo nearly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated. And I may, perhaps, from my intimate acquaintance with him, be thought to be the moſt proper, and beſt qualified perſon, to delineate his character.—But ſhould I do this; it might, perhaps be contrary to what he would have choſen.</p>
            <p>You all know, he reſtrained himſelf from ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices of this kind. He never attempted, in my day, ſo far as I can recollect to give a funeral character, but once. It was upon occaſion of the death of preſident WADSWORTH, who had, for ſeveral years, been a joint-labourer with him in the paſtoral care of this Church. This he called "an extraordinary caſe," and made it his apology for doing that, which, with him, was ſo unuſual a thing. The preſent caſe is as "extraordinary"; and will as well juſtifie me, as it could him, and upon the ſame principles,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011207_0021_0F862C83712B1CC8"/>
ſhould I endeavour to take ſome notice of the qualities, in my deceaſed brother, which render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him ſo valuable a ſervant of Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>IT pleaſed the former of the ſpirit of man within him to ſend him into the world with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tellectual powers, much beyond the common ſize; and his advantages in childhood and youth for their culture by education were ſuch as gave occaſion for their enlargement in a ſtill more noble degree. Not many exceeded him in quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of apprehenſion, clearneſs of perception, copiouſneſs of invention, livelineſs of imaginati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, ſtrength of memory, ſoundneſs of judgment, and the faculty of reaſoning. Of theſe natural accompliſhments, ſtrengthened by improvement, his publications are a ſpecimen; and they will do honor to him, as they have already done, in the opinion of all capable judges.</p>
            <p>HE was a friend to liberty, eſpecially that "liberty wherewith our Lord Jeſus Chriſt has made his churches free." In his younger years, particularly while at college, and under the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of education, his father being an epiſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>palian by profeſſion and principle, he entertained ſo ſtrong an opinion of the "Engliſh eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal eſtabliſhment," that it was his full intention to take orders in the church of England, and would ſcarce be perſuaded to read any authors but thoſe of that communion. But<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> after he had proceeded batchelor of arts, in conſequence of diligent ſtudy, and free converſation, he altered his ſentiments, profeſſing a firm adherence to the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011207_0022_0F862C84317C6D30"/>
mode of worſhip and government practiced in the New-England churches. And though he always retained a candid charitable opinion of thoſe members of the Epiſcopal church whoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>havior was as becometh godlineſs; yet it was his full perſuaſion, that the church it ſelf was defiled with the inventions of man, and laid an undue reſtraint upon true chriſtian liberty. I know of no one that was, upon principle, a more zealous friend to the manner of worſhip and diſcipline in theſe churches, and that more earneſtly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>precated thoſe innovations with which we have been threatned He has in as maſterly a way, and with as comprehenſive knowledge, wrote in defence of our "ordination by the hands of the preſbytery," as any one I could name.</p>
            <p>HE was alſo a faſt friend to our college at cambridge, ſought its welfare, and laid himſelf out, within his proper ſphere, to do it all the ſervice in his power.</p>
            <p>HE was young when ordained a paſtor of this church; but well qualified with gifts, and had, I truſt, before that time, been made a partaker of the "grace that is in Chriſt Jeſus." He was, in that day, much applauded for his miniſterial accompliſhments. Multitudes flocked to hear him. No miniſter in town, or country, was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted either a more polite and elegant, or a more devout and edifying preacher. And this was the general voice concerning him, till diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, we are all liable to, weakened the vigor, perhaps, of his mind, as well as body. This
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:011207_0023_0F862C858CAF9AB8"/>
was undoubtedly the caſe, in ſome of his later years. And if that chriſtian candor, which might reaſonably have been expected from thoſe eſpecially who had enjoyed the benefit of his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer more vigorous labors, had been in due exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, it would have been no hindrance to their ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual edification. Had he lived till the 20th of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember next, he would have been your fixed paſtor for the long ſpace of fifty two years. I bear him witneſs, he had an affectionate con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for your ſpiritual welfare, to which it was owing that he exhorted, rebuked, comforted, and charged you as a father doth his children; being willing to impart to you not only the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of the bleſſed God, but his own ſoul alſo, becauſe you were dear to him. Should I call you to it, you would openly declare, that he had been an "example to you in word, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, in charity, in faith, in purity," and in all thoſe other virtues which adorn the chriſtian's and the miniſter's character. Brethren, "you are witneſſes, and God alſo, how holily, and juſtly, and unblamably, he behaved himſelf among you;" approving himſelf "a miniſter of God, in much patience, in labor, in watchings, in faſtings, by pureneſs, by knowledge, by long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuffering, by kindneſs, by the Holy Ghoſt, by love unfeigned, by the word of truth, by the power of God, by the armour of righteouſneſs on the right hand, and on the left."</p>
            <p>I may go on, and ſay, thoſe acquainted with Mr. Foxcroft muſt have obſerved his laudable
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011207_0024_0F862C85B0CE0C90"/>
behaviour in the various relations of life. When an huſband, how faithful and kind! As a father, how careful to inſtruct, guide, and govern his children! As a maſter, how juſt and equal! As a neighbour, how ready to all the offices of chriſtian goodneſs! As a miniſter, how diligent, conſtant, and laborious in doing the duties of his calling! How ſkilful a divider of the word of truth! How pungent in his applications to the ſouls of his hearers! How careful to adapt his diſcourſes to the various occurrences in provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that they might, by this means, be the more ſeaſonable, and profitable! How fervent was his zeal for the cauſe of God and religion! How reſolute his boldneſs in teſtifying againſt vice, and apprehended error! fearing the face of no man, while perſuaded in his own mind he was doing that, which would be acceptable in the ſight of God. He ſhone with great bright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs as a preacher, while in the full enjoyment of health and ſtrength. He was indeed a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough divine. He had a general knowledge of moſt of the learned arts; was a good gramma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian, well acquainted both with latin and greek, eſpecially the new-teſtament greek, in which his criticiſms were frequent, and juſt; and ſuch, as if collected together, and placed in one view before the public, would give him an high repu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation in the learned world. But he excelled in his knowledge of divinity. This was his principal ſtudy; and he has left few who were equal to him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:011207_0025_0F862C8683961B28"/>HE was, by bodily conſtitution, liable to ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denneſs, which was heightned by the ill ſtate of his health; but he made it his care to govern his reſentments, keeping them under the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints of reaſon and religion. He was himſelf a ſtranger to all the arts of intrigue and diſſimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, and deteſted them in others. His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation was ſerious, but not affected; pleaſant and affable, but not light and vain. He had a turn for ſatyr, which he could expreſs with an emphatical air, but was always cautious that he did not needleſly give offence.</p>
            <p>HIS religion, though ſpiritual, was ſubſtanti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al; not tainted with ſuperſtition, not made ridiculous by the influence of enthuſiaſm. He was, in the judgment of all who were acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with him, a real good chriſtian; a partaker of the Holy Ghoſt, and of that faith in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velations of God which purified his heart, wro't by love, and influenced his whole conduct in life. He was uniform and ſteady in his walk with God, in the way of his commandments: though, inſtead of "truſting that he was righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous" in the eye of ſtrict law, he accounted himſelf an "unprofitable ſervant"; fixing his dependence, not on his own worthineſs, not on any works of righteouſneſs which he had done, but on the mercy of God, and the atoning blood, and perfect righteouſneſs, of Jeſus Chriſt the Savior.</p>
            <p>HE had upon his mind, for ſome time before
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011207_0026_0F862C87237210F0"/>
his death, a prevailing apprehenſion, that he ſhould ſoon go the way of all the earth; which he more than once ſignified to his children, and to a friend going a long journey, taking his final farewell and ſaying, "She would ſee him no more". Whether it was from this apprehenſion, or the general ſeaſonableneſs of ſpeaking to his people upon ſuch a ſubject I know not; but it may be worthy of notice, the four laſt Sermons he preached was from thoſe words, in the book of Job, "all the days of my appointed time I will wait, till my change comes." It may na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally be ſuppoſed, he was, in ſome of the laſt weeks of his life, particularly thoughtful of the great change by death, and diligent in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration for it.</p>
            <p>THE manner of God's calling him out of the world was ſudden and violent. He was ſo deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſtruck, as, in a few minutes, to be deprived both of his reaſon and his ſenſes; and, in this lethargic ſtate he continued about twenty eight hours, when he fell aſleep in Jeſus; with whom, we truſt, he is now preſent, in the paradiſe of God, reſting from his labors, and enjoying the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that is proper to the "ſpirits of juſt men made perfect."</p>
            <p>YOU, his dear relatives, I know, think thus concerning him; and while this is your faith, you can have no reaſon to "weep for him", however you may "weep for your ſelves."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:011207_0027_0F862C886F2B12C0"/>WE wiſh for you all the aids of divine grace, whereby you may be enabled ſo to improve this diſpenſation in the alwiſe government of God, as that it may be for your ſpiritual profit here, and eternal well being hereafter.</p>
            <p>WE particularly unite in our ſupplications be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the throne of mercy for the children, from whom it has pleaſed God to take an affectionate father. Be thankful he was ſo long continued to you, and that you enjoyed ſo great a bleſſing in him. And take it not amiſs, if I, who was joined with him, and ſo long lived his fellow-wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker in the kingdom of Chriſt, do now in his ſtead, and in God's name, ſeriouſly and ſolemnly give it in charge to you, "to know the God of your father<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to ſerve him with a perfect heart, and with a willing mind". And let me aſſure you, "if you ſeek him, he will be found of you; but if you forſake him, he will caſt you off fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver." The language of the bereavement you are viſited with is that, "wilt thou not from this time, cry unto me, my father! Thou art my guide." And if you thus chuſe God for your father and friend, you will reap the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of ſo happy a choice all along in life; and may triumph in thoſe comforting words, "this God is our God—he will be our guide unto death, and through death, and our portion for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever." We wiſh for the ſurviving ſon a double portion of that good Spirit which reſted on his father; and may he long be continued a rich bleſſing to the church of Chriſt in general, and to that flock of his in ſpecial, over which the Holy Ghoſt has placed him!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:011207_0028_0F862C88CCEC1718"/>I NEED not, my brethren, recommend to your kind regards the children of the deceaſed, who lived in his family. You not only made ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able proviſion for the decent, reſpectful funeral of their father, but have done generouſly for them alſo. Forget not ſtill to do them good, as there may be occaſion; for "with ſuch ſacrifices God is well pleaſed."</p>
            <p>AND now, "dearly beloved in the Lord", ſhall it not be your care to make a wiſe and good uſe of this article in the conduct of heaven towards you? will you not adore before the dread Sovereign of the world, who is "righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works"; gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving him the glory of a profound ſubmiſſion to his alwiſe pleaſure?</p>
            <p>HAS your now dead paſtor been a ſpiritual father to any of you, having begotten you to Chriſt, through the goſpel, under the influence of the Holy Ghoſt? You will ſurely remember him in love! You can never forget him, who, under God, has been ſalvation to you.—Have any of you, by his public miniſtry, or private converſation, been ſupported under tryals, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned in darkneſs, comforted in tribulation, or ſtrengthned to go on with ſpeed and vigor in the way towards heaven? you cannot but ſpeak of him with thankfulneſs to God—His memory, with you, will be always bleſſed. But if any of you, inſtead of hearkning to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſels, admonitions, exhortations, and warnings,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011207_0029_0F862C8A23607CF0"/>
which God diſpenſed to you by his mouth, have ſtopped your ears, and hardened your hearts, and are to this day ſecure in ſin; "walking in the way of your heart, and in the ſight of your eye", you have infinite reaſon for deep humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. You have caſt contempt on God, by not paying a ſutable regard to the meſſages ſent to you by this his ſervant; and unleſs you repair to goſpel mercy, in the exerciſe of unfeigned repentance, he will appear a ſwift witneſs againſt you in the day, when "God ſhall judge the world by the man Jeſus," whom he hath ordain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned to tranſact this important buſineſs.</p>
            <p>AND may all, who are members of this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient ſociety, "remember what you have heard, and hold faſt" the profeſſion of your faith. I beſeech you, brethren, and exhort you, by the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, "that as ye have received" of your deceaſed paſtor "how ye ought to walk, ſo that we would abound more and more. "Be watchful, and ſtrengthen the things which remain that are ready to die." He that "walketh in the midſtof the golden candleſticks, and holds the ſtars in his right hand," has "ſomewhat againſt us, becauſe we have left our firſt love." Let us "remember from whence we are fallen, and repent, and do the firſt works." Our bleſſed Lord, I truſt, has yet a "a few names in this his Sardis, who have not defiled their garments: and they ſhall walk with him in white, for they are worthy." May the number be increaſed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to a great multitude! We are the firſt chriſtian church that was ever formed in this town. May
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011207_0030_0F862C8A2D3A4EE0"/>
we be the firſt in ſpiritual glory! May it pleaſe the great head over all things to add to our num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and to our graces! And may we go on ſhining in all the beauties of holineſs, till we are "preſented a glorious church, without ſpot or wrinkle, before God, even the father," in that kingdom which ſhall have no end!</p>
            <p>I SHALL not think it a digreſſion, if I ſay, that the death we are ſolemniſing is a loud call in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence to the miniſters of the Town, the aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciated ones in ſpecial. He was one of our num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, often with us in conſultation for the intereſt of the kingdom of Jeſus, and an ancient venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and highly valuable member. And, by his removal into the other world, we are taught by our Lord, that we alſo ſhall "ſhortly put off theſe our tabernacles." May we hear his voice, and, in imitation of him "work" with zeal and diligence "the work of him that ſent us"; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membering that "the night cometh when we cannot work! May thoſe among us, in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, attend to it, who have been permitted to live till we are far advanced in years! Of the eleven aſſociated paſtors in this town, one has exceeded four-ſcore years; another threeſcore years and ten; four have reached beyond threeſcore years; one is above fifty, and another above forty years old. Three only of our number are young men. But they may die in the ſtrength and vigor of life. A ſerious thought! and it ſhould quicken their zeal, and animate their reſolution, to be faithful and diligent in fulfilling the miniſtry
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011207_0031_0F862C8AE4F27B18"/>
they have had committed to them. But, for us who are grown into years, "our Lord Jeſus Chriſt has ſhewed us" by his word, and is "ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us" in his providence, that we muſt ſhortly depart. May our hearts be duly impreſſed with a juſt ſenſe of this momentous truth! And may it influence us to the moſt arduous en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavors, that we may finiſh our courſe with joy!</p>
            <p>There will, my brethren, in a few years at longeſt, come on a great change of miniſters in this Town. Moſt of the preſent ones will, according to the courſe of nature, very ſhort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be laid in their graves. May their be a ſucceſſion of thoſe, who ſhall be eminently inſtrumental in ſerving the Redeemer's intereſt in theſe churches! Perhaps, there never was a town, in any part of the world, ſince the days of the apoſtles, more ſignally bleſſed than this has been, from its beginning, with ſkilful, able, faithful goſpel miniſters. Inſtead of thoſe that are gone, and going, off the ſtage of life and action, may that God, with whom is the reſidue of the ſpirit, raiſe up, and qualify, others to ſupply their places, and to do more worthily for him in their day and generation!</p>
            <p>IT were to be wiſhed, that both miniſters and people would continually entertain in their minds the thought, that they dwell in weak feeble tabernacles, that will ſhortly be broke to pieces by this or the other diſeaſe, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter, in the providential government of God.
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011207_0032_0F862C8CA45B3C58"/>
Miniſters would then preach, and their people would then hear, as becomes dying men. And ſuch preaching, and ſuch hearing, would, under the bleſſing of God, be effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual to the ſalvation of miniſters themſelves, and thoſe that hear them.</p>
            <p>NOW to the only living, unchangeable, immortal God, be given all glory, honor, majeſty and Dominion, by the church of Chriſt, throughout all ages, in this world; and throughout eternity, in the coming one. AMEN and AMEN.</p>

            <head>Appendix. From the <hi>Maſſachuſetts Gazette,</hi> of June 22. 1769.</head>
            <p>LAST ſaturday morning, the Reverend Mr. THOMAS FOXCROFT, ſenior Paſtor of the firſt Church in this Town, was ſuddenly ſtruck with a diſorder, partly apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plectic, partly palſaic, which deprived him of his reaſon, locked up his ſenſes, and put an end to his life the following day, about ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of the clock, in the ſeventy third year of his Age.</p>
            <p>HE was born in Boſton, but in early child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood became an inhabitant of Cambridge, the ſeat of Harvard-College; where he was favored with as good an education as could be had in the country, in that day. This, toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther with the ſuperior intellectual powers, the Father of ſpirits was pleaſed to beſtow on them, laid the foundation for thoſe learned accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments, which diſtinguiſhed him from moſt of his brethren in the miniſtry. He took his degrees of Bachelor and Maſter of Arts in the years 1714, and 1717. His Father, FRANCIS FOXCROFT, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> a Member of the Church of
<pb facs="unknown:011207_0034_0F862C8DEA6EFDC8"/>
England, tho' candid in his ſentiments of other denominations of chriſtians, which he ſignified by ſtatedly joining in worſhip with the Congregational Church at Cambridge, where he reſided, the remaining part of his life, after he left Boſton:—His Father in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended he ſhould be an Epiſcopal Clergy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man. And this was his own intention, till, by diligent ſtudy, and free converſation with that great Reaſoner, and eminently pious Man, the Rev. Mr. NEHEMIAH WALTER, (then Paſtor of the Church at Roxbury, in which place he was called to be at the head of a Grammar-School for a few years,) he was obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged to think, that the mode of worſhip and government in our Churches, was more agreeable to <hi>Scripture Rule</hi> than that of the Engliſh Church. In the year 1729, he publiſhed, in anſwer to "Mr. T. Barclay's Perſuaſive," which had been diſtributed in New-England, his work entitled, "the <hi>ruling</hi> and <hi>ordaining</hi> Power of <hi>Congregati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Biſhops,</hi> or <hi>Preſbyters</hi> defended;" in which he ſhewed himſelf a maſter in this controverſy. The Power of <hi>Preſbyters,</hi> or <hi>Scripture Biſhops</hi> to ordain and <hi>govern,</hi> is here ſet in a ſtrong point of light: Few have wrote upon the ſubject with greater clearneſs, more accuracy, or ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler extent of knowledge. This highly valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble performance has received no anſwer to this day.</p>
            <p>IN the Month of March, 1717, he was called to the paſtoral office of the firſt Church in this Town, and on the 20th of Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber following was ordained their Miniſter in
<pb facs="unknown:011207_0035_0F862C8EAC622308"/>
partnerſhip with the Rev. Mr. BENJAMIN WADSWORTH. Perhaps, no Miniſter in Boſton, upon his firſt ſettlement, was ever more uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally admired. He was then held in high re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, as one of the beſt accompliſhed preachers; and this continued to be the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral opinion of him, till there came on a change in the taſte of people, and in the vigor of his conſtitution by repeated diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of one kind or another. His publiſhed Sermons, upon a great variety of occaſions, and in all the periods of his miniſterial life, will do honor to him as long as there are any capable judges of juſtneſs of thought, copi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs of invention, elegance of ſtile, ſtrength of reaſoning, enlivened with a ſpirit of piety running through the whole. He was in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent a ſtrict <hi>Calvaniſt</hi>; though catholic in his diſpoſition towards others who did not think juſt as he did. And, what ought to be men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to his honor, he was no TRIMMER, but ſteadily and uniformly adhered to the <hi>Calvinian</hi> principles, which he took to be the true Scripture ones; making them the chief ſubjects of his pulpit diſcourſes, as he thought he ſhould hereby "pleaſe God," if he did not always "pleaſe Men." It may be juſtly ſaid of Mr. FOXCROFT, that he was a good ſcholar, an able critick, both in Greek and Latin, and conſiderably acquainted with moſt of the arts and ſciences; though Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinity was his favorite ſtudy, in which he excelled; not having left many, if indeed any
<pb facs="unknown:011207_0036_0F862C8F7875BC40"/>
ſuperior to him. But the beſt and greateſt thing that can be ſaid of him is, that he was, as we have abundant reaſon to believe, a good chriſtian, and a faithful miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, in whoſe ſervice he labored, as a fixed paſtor, nearly fifty-two years. He was called, in this period of time, to paſs through a variety of trials, as well as ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, which gave opportunity for the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe and eſtabliſhment of many virtues, both private and ſocial, by which he honored God, did good in his generation, and was formed to a greater meetneſs for the enjoyment of the upper world, to which he was admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, as we truſt, of the free rich mercy of God through Jeſus Chriſt, at the day of his departure hence.</p>
            <p>He has left behind a Son and five Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, for whom we wiſh the guidance and bleſſing of him who has ſtiled himſelf "the father of the fatherleſs."</p>
            <p>He was buried yeſterday with all decent reſpect; the Church to which he had long miniſtred bearing the expence of the funeral.</p>
