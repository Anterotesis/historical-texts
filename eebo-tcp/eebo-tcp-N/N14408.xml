      TEI @ Oxford.

         </projectDesc>
         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>Art 2. And that all disputes which might arise in future, on the subject of the boundaries of the said United States, may be prevented, it is hereby agreed and declared, that the following are and shall be their boundaries, viz. From the north west angle of Nova Scotia, viz. that angle which is formed by a line drawn due north from the source of St. Croix river to the Highland, along the said Highlands, which divide those rivers that empty themselves into the river St. Lawrence, from those which sail into the Atlantic Ocean, to the north-western most head of Connecticut-River; thence down along the middle of that river to the forty-fifth degree of north latitude; from thence by a line due west of said latitude, until it strikes the river Irriquois or Cataraqui; thence along the middle of the said river into Lake Ontario; through the middle of the said lake until it strikes the communication by water between that lake and Lake Erie; thence along the middle of said communication into Lake Erie, through the mid<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dle of said lake, until it arrives at the water communication between that lake and Lake Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ron, thence through the middle of said lake to the water communication between that lake and Lake Superior; thence through Lake Superior, northward of the isles Royal and Purlipeaux to the Long Lake; thence through the middle of said Long Lake and the water communication between it and the Lake of the Woods, to the said lake of the Woods, thence through the said lake to the most north-western point thereof, and from thence on a due west course to the river Mississippi; thence by a line to be drawn along the middle of the said river Mississippi; thence by a line to be drawn along the middle of the said river Mississippi until it shall intersect the northernmost part of the thirty first degree of north latitude.

            <p>Art. 3. It is agreed that the people of the United States shall continue to enjoy unmolested the right to take fish of every kind on the Grand Bank, and on all the other banks of Newfound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, also in the gulph of St. Lawrence, and all other places in the sea, where the inhabitants of both countries used at any time heretofore to fish. And also that the inhabitants of the United States shall have liberty to take fish of every kind on such part of the coast of Newfoundland as British fishermen shall use, (but not to dry or cure the same on that island) and also on the coasts, bays and creeks of all others of his Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tannic majesty's dominions in America; and that the American fishermen shall have liberty to dry and cure fish in any of the unsettled bays, har<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>bours and creeks of Nova-Scotia, Magdalen Is<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>lands and Labrador, so long as the same shall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unsettled; but so soon as the same or either of them shall be settled, it shall not be lawful for the said fishermen to dry or cure fish at such set<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>tlement, without a previous agreement for that purpose with the inhabitants, proprietors or pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sessors of the ground.</p>
            <p>Art. 4. It is agreed that the creditors on ei<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ther side shall meet with no lawful impediment to the recovery of the full value, in sterling money, of all bona fide debts heretofore contracted.</p>

It is agreed that Congress shall ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly recommend it to the legislatures of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spective states, to provide for the restitution of all estates, rights and properties, which have been confiscated, belonging to real British sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects; and also of the estates, rights and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of persons resident in districts in the possessi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his majesty's arms, and who have not borne arms against the said United States; and that persons of any other description shall have free liberty to go to any part or parts of any of the Thirteen United States, and therein to remain twelve months unmolested in their endeavors to obtain the restitution of such of their estates, rights and properties, as may have been confiscated; and that Congress shall also earnestly recommend to the several states a reconsideration and revision of all acts or laws regarding the premises, so as to render the said laws or acts perfectly consist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent, not only with justice and equity, but with that spirit of conciliation, which, on the return of the blessings of peace, should universally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail: and that Congress shall also earnestly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to the several states, that the estates, rights and properties of such last mentioned per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons shall be restored to them, they refunding to any persons who may be now in possession the bona fide price (where any has been given) which such persons may have paid on purchasing any of the said lands, rights or properties since the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiscation.</p>
            <p>And it is agreed, that all persons who have a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny interest in confiscated lands, either by debts, marriage settlements, or otherwise, shall meet with no lawful impediment in the prosecution of their just rights.</p>

There shall be a firm and perpetual peace between his Britannic majesty and the said states, and between the subjects of the one and the citizens of the other; wherefore all hostilities, both by sea and land, shall from henceforth cease; all prisoners on both sides shall be set at liberty, and his Britannic majesty shall, with all convenient speed, and without causing any destruction, or carrying away any negroes, or other property of the American inhabitants, withdraw all his armies, garrisons and fleets, from the said United States, and from every port, place and harbour, within the same, leaving in all fortifications the American artillery that may be therein; and shall also order and cause all archives, records, deeds and papers belonging to any of the said States, or their ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens, which in the course of the war may have fallen into the hands of his officers, to be forthwith restored, and delivered to the proper state and persons to whom they belong.</p>
            <p>Art. 8. The navigation of the river Mississippi, from its source to the ocean, shall for ever remain free and open to the subjects of Great-Britain, and the citizens of the United States.</p>
            <p>Art. 9.
