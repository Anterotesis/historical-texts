            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Subject of the following <hi>Treatiſe</hi> is one of the Doctrines of the <hi>Reformation,</hi> embrac'd and own'd by the <hi>Proteſtant Churches,</hi> when they threw off the Yoke, and renounc'd the Errors of <hi>Popery;</hi> and is particularly the Doctrine, not only of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> but of <hi>England</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> as they are by Law eſtabliſhed. Yet it is embrac'd by <hi>us,</hi> as it
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:004497_0003_100D31C0E45CC6E0"/>was by the <hi>Reformers</hi> from Popery, becauſe we find it in our <hi>Bible.</hi> This it is that makes us <hi>Predeſtinarians</hi> and <hi>Calviniſts:</hi> For <hi>Calvin</hi> nor <hi>Auguſtine,</hi> nor any Names whatever, are any thing to us, but as they ſpeak from the <hi>Holy Scriptures.</hi> Theſe are our only <hi>Oracles.</hi> What we find there, we believe and profeſs, tho' incomprehenſible to our weak and ſhallow Minds, which are by no means the Meaſure of Truth. And we think we act a perfectly rational Part, as well as reverent before the HIGH GOD, the Infinite <hi>Intelligence,</hi> in bowing our Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtandings to his Revelations reſpecting Truth and Duty, even where we cannot anſwer every Scruple or <hi>Objection,</hi> for the reconciling <hi>ſeeming Oppoſitions.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let none then entertain the Doctrine of <hi>Election</hi> with <hi>Averſion,</hi> Scoff and Ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cule; but with the loweſt <hi>Reverence</hi> and higheſt <hi>Adoration.</hi> You will ſee with what <hi>Reaſon</hi> from the plain and <hi>ſincere word</hi> of God, thro' the following <hi>Diſcourſes;</hi> which are, in our Judgment, as modeſt, ſtrong and brief an Explanation and Vindication of this important Truth, as the <hi>Reader</hi> will be like to meet with: and well ſuited to convince <hi>Gainſayers,</hi> ſatisfy the <hi>doubting,</hi> eſtabliſh the <hi>wavering,</hi> and ſtop the Mouth

            <p>We willingly take this Opportunity to teſtify our Concurrence with the <hi>Author</hi> in the Verity and Importance of this <hi>Doctrine;</hi> and our Satisfaction in his having preach'd and publiſh'd theſe Diſcourſes.</p>
            <p>And it is our hearty Prayer to God that the Churches of the Reformation, and <hi>our</hi> Churches in particular, may be confirm'd and eſtabliſhed in this and other Doctrines of <hi>Grace,</hi> as they have been of old deliver'd to 'em and received by 'em: And that as it is their indiſputable <hi>Right</hi> and Duty in their choice of <hi>Paſtors,</hi> to take heed to the Soundneſs of their <hi>Principles,</hi> as well as to their godly <hi>Life</hi> and edifying <hi>Gifts,</hi> they may ever do ſo in Fidelity to <hi>God,</hi> and Care of their own <hi>Souls,</hi> and thoſe of their Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies.</p>
            <p>That theſe <hi>Diſcourſes</hi> may be attended with a Divine Bleſſing for theſe Ends, and that our dear <hi>Brother</hi> may long live a Bleſſing to the <hi>Flock</hi> over which the HOLY

                  </note> ſays of this chapter, many of the people of God have found it a well ſpring of comfort to their ſouls, living and dying, and have ſuck'd and been ſatisfied from theſe breaſts of conſolation, and <hi>with joy drawn water out of theſe wells of ſalvation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Having reckon'd up many particular in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the happineſs of true chriſtians, ſuch as a freedom from guilt and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, a relation to God as his children, a title to future glory, and the concurrence of all providences to promote their ſpiritual and everlaſting good, he repreſents the ground of all theſe as laid in God's eternal decree of Election, or Predeſtination unto life, in the words that I have read. <hi>For whom he did fore-know, them he alſo did predeſtinate,</hi> &amp;c. Here the order of the cauſes of our ſalvation is plainly ſet before us Theſe words have been commonly call'd the golden chain of
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:004497_0008_100D58DBA14AE748"/>ſalvation; and ſuch a chain it is as cannot be broken. There are four links in it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. <hi>Whom he did fore-know, he alſo did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate to be conformed to the image of his Son.</hi> Whom he did <hi>fore-know.</hi> This is the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation upon which the whole frame of the ſurpriſing work of man's redemption ſtands; the firſt thing to be conſider'd in the ſcheme of ſalvation, upon which all the other parts follow, and with which they are inſepera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly connected. It is here ſaid of a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the children of men, as diſtinguiſh'd from the reſt, that God has fore-known them. And this fore-knowledge implies choice; his having pitch'd upon them to be the objects on whom his redeeming grace ſhall be glorified. It is the ſame with that <hi>ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting love,</hi> wherewith he is ſaid to have loved his people, Jer. 31.3. And means nothing leſs than his having <hi>ſet them apart for himſelf,</hi> Pſal. 4.3. Words of knowledge in ſcripture often ſignifie affection and choice. So God ſaid to <hi>Moſes,</hi> Exod. 33.17 <hi>Thou haſt found grace in my ſight, and I know thee by name.</hi> Where one expreſſion explains the other. So the apoſtle tells us, 1 Cor. 8.3.

                  </note> The ſame word is rendred <hi>fore-ordained,</hi> in 1 Pet. 1.20. <hi>Who,</hi> (i. e. Chriſt) <hi>was verily</hi> fore ordained <hi>before the foundation of the world, but was manifeſt in theſe laſt times for you.</hi> God's fore-knowing his people means nothing leſs than his eternal purpoſe to make them his friends and favourites. It muſt ſignifie his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:004497_0010_100D58E1837E8418"/>mining to do them good, to call, juſtifie, and ſanctifie them now, and glorifie them hereafter.</p>
               <p>Thoſe whom God thus fore-knew, he did <hi>predeſtinate to be conformed to the image of his ſon;</hi> to be like to Jeſus Chriſt in the temper of their minds, and actions of their lives. This takes in the whole work of ſanctification, of which Chriſt is the great pattern and ſamplar. Obſerve; It is not ſaid God fore-knew they <hi>would</hi> be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd to the image of his ſon, and ſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated them, as ſome turn the ſence of the words. This cannot be the meaning of them; for this conformity to Chriſt is ſaid to be the thing they are predeſtinated <hi>to,</hi> and is made the reſult of this fore-knowledge; the effect of it, and not the cauſe. <hi>Whom he did foreknow, them he did predeſtinate to be conformed to the image of his ſon.</hi> Being deſign'd for glory and happineſs as the end, they are decreed to grace and holineſs as the way. For if there is a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between fore-knowledge and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination, it ſeems to be this, the former is the appointment of the end, the other of the means unto it. And they are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated to this conformity to the image of the ſon of God, for the honour of Chriſt, whoſe glory is deſign'd by the Father in the whole work of redemption. <hi>That he might
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004497_0011_100D58E3A6B4A548"/>be the firſt born among many brethren;</hi> might have the honour of being the great pattern of holineſs, as well as the meritorious cauſe of our ſalvation and ſo in all things might have the preheminence.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Whom he did predeſtinate, them he alſo <hi>called.</hi> Not only with the external call; ſo many are called, that were not choſen <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Matt.</hi> 12.16</note>; but with the internal and effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual call; which is the work of the Spirit of God, whereby he convinces the conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of guilt and wrath, enlightens the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding in the knowledge of Chriſt; bows the will, and inclines the heart, to embrace him as a ſaviour, and obey him as a king and lord. 'Tis, ſays one, an effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual call from ſelf and earth, to God, and Chriſt, and heaven, as the end; from ſin and vanity, to grace and holineſs, and ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, as the way." This is the firſt open work of grace upon an elect perſon. And all whom God has from eternity pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated to grace and glory, he does in his own way and time, thus effectually call.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Whom he called, them he alſo <hi>juſtified.</hi> Being in their effectual calling perſwaded and enabled to embrace the Lord Jeſus
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004497_0012_100D58E5CFBC0BB0"/>Chriſt as he is offered in the goſpel, they are thro' him abſolved from guilt, and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted as righteous; are no longer look'd upon and dealt with as criminals, but own'd and lov'd as friends and favourites.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Whom he juſtified, them he alſo <hi>glorified.</hi> The other privileges the elect of God are made partakers of in time, this of glorification, when time ſhall be with them no more; in the ſoul firſt at death, in ſoul and body united after the reſurrection, through a bleſſed never-ending eternity. To this they were deſign'd in their electi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; for this they are prepared by their effectual calling, and the ſanctification of the ſpirit; that which hindreth is taken out of the way in their juſtification; and now, what can come between ſuch a ſoul and glory? <hi>As for God his work is perfect</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. 18.30</note>; and in the glorification of all the elect, his deſign of love to them will have its full accompliſhment.</p>
               <p>It is not my intention to ſpeak of all theſe privileges in the order in which they ſtand connected in our text; and I have but lately diſcours'd concerning two of them, <hi>effectual calling</hi> and <hi>juſtification.</hi> My preſent purpoſe therefore is, to treat only
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004497_0013_100D58E7F0E0D910"/>of that which is the ground of them all, and from which the reſt reſult, namely, <hi>Election,</hi> or <hi>Predeſtination unto life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This is an illuſtrious and very precious doctrine of chriſtianity; ſo plainly reveal'd in the holy ſcriptures, that 'tis really ſtrange that any who profeſs to regulate their faith by the <hi>bible</hi> can deny it. Yet 'tis not only deny'd by many, but decried and reproach'd as unworthy of God, and prejudicial to religion; while others who don't care to deny it, yet ſpeak of it as amongſt thoſe myſterious, controverſial, and ſpeculative points, which it is beſt not to meddle with; and ſo they would have it ſmother'd in the church, and ſhut out of our ſermons.</p>
               <p>True indeed this doctrine has its myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, and abſtruſe difficulties, when our minds try to enter far into it; ſo has other doctrines of the goſpel which yet we muſt <hi>affirm conſtantly,</hi> and endeavour to explain. Nor is it a doctrine purely ſpeculative; no, it has a powerful influence upon vital re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and practical godlineſs — It has a direct tendency to advance the glory of God's grace in our ſalvation, to humble the pride of man, to engage the love, excite the praiſes, and conſtrain the obedience of God's children.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="9" facs="unknown:004497_0014_100D58EAF1CF8A88"/>
Our ſaviour preach'd this doctrine; ſo did his apoſtles after him; and the epiſtles to the churches are full of it; which plain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſhews God would not have it lock'd up from his people. Should we therefore, who now preach the goſpel to you, paſs it over in ſilence, we ſhould not be able to ſay we have <hi>declar'd</hi> to you <hi>the whole counſel of God.</hi> I humbly apprehend ſuch an omiſſion would be in effect to ſay, that Chriſt and his apoſtles preach'd, and the ſcriptures reveal a doctrine, which is found to be uſeleſs if not hurtful, and therefore may not now be inſiſted on. And would not this be to reproach the Holy Spirit who has indited the ſcriptures, and to do an unſpeakable injury to revelation it ſelf?</p>
               <p>Beſides, we are verily perſwaded the edification and conſolation of the people of God, are not a little concern'd in the opening and applying of this truth; and that many other doctrines of the goſpel cannot be righly underſtood without it — I have therefore choſen this for my ſubject, out of the chapter that has been read in courſe this afternoon; ſenſible, I hope, that 'tis an awful and tremendous ſubject; and with an humble dependence on the Holy Spirit ſo to enlighten and aſſiſt me, as that the truth may not ſuffer, nor any ſoul be hurt, thro' an unskilful management.</p>
               <p>

Indeed, let the ſubject be managed never ſo cautiouſly &amp; ſcripturally, it can hardly be expected but it will be treated as the diſcourſes of the apoſtle himſelf were, of whom we read, Acts 19.8, 9. That when <hi>he went into the ſynagogue, and ſpake boldly for the ſpace of three months, diſputing and perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding the things concerning the kingdom of God, divers were hardned, and believed not, but ſpake evil of that way before the multitude.</hi> But duty is ours, and the event God's. We muſt always leave the ſucceſs of our preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him; and we are aſſured his word will <hi>not return void,</hi> but <hi>will accompliſh the thing whereunto it is ſent</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Iſa, 55.11.</note> If any ſhould be enrag'd and hardn'd by the things that are ſpoken, and <hi>wreſt</hi> them to their own de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction, (which God forbid!) ſome, I truſt, may be confirm'd, edified, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted. Yea, poſſibly theſe diſcourſes on election, may be bleſs'd for the converſion of ſome of the elect of God, who may be awakned hereby to <hi>give diligence to make their calling and election ſure:</hi> And if ſo, free grace will have the glory.</p>
               <p>Tho' I ſhall ſtudy as much brevity as is conſiſtent with clearneſs, yet I can't pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute my deſign within the compaſs of a
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004497_0016_100D58EE01CD9FC8"/>ſingle ſermon; three or four diſcourſes, if God give us the opportunity for them, will be little eno' for my purpoſe And now, my Hearers, let me crave, and, as I ſpeak in the name of Chriſt, I may demand your reverend and ſerious attention. Let me entreat you to lay aſide prejudices, if you have entertain'd any, againſt this doctrine, and to <hi>receive with meekneſs the engrafted word which is able to ſave your ſouls.</hi> Let me de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire you to ſtop all cenſures till I have fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd the ſubject, if, thro' the good hand of our God upon us, I may be allowed to do ſo. And let me further ask you, before I proceed, to lift up your heart to God, in ſome ſuch ſecret petition as this, "Lord! If this doctrine be according to thy mind and will, ſuffer not my mind to be preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced againſt it; but help me to receive it in the love of it, and to improve it to all thoſe holy ſaving purpoſes for which thou haſt reveal'd it in thy word!" If any will not do thus, let me tell them, their minds are not rightly diſpos'd to hear, nor can they be look'd upon to be ſincere enquirers after truth.</p>
               <p>And now the method in which, thro' divine aſſiſtance, I would purſue the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject is this,</p>

I. I would repreſent and ſtate the truth, to ſhew you what we intend by the doctrine of Election, or Predeſtination unto life.</p>
               <p n="2">II. I will endeavour to prove it, and ſhew that the doctrine ſo repreſented and ſtated, is really the doctrine of the goſpel.</p>

               <p>Laſtly, I ſhall endeavour to improve it to the great ends of ſerious religion, and practical godlineſs.</p>
               <p n="1">I. I am in the firſt place, to <hi>repreſent</hi> and <hi>ſtate</hi> the truth, and ſhew what we in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend by the doctrine of Election, or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtination
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004497_0018_100D58F3D82CD3D8"/>unto life. And I chuſe to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe it to you in the terms of the 17th among the famous articles of the church of <hi>England,</hi> which are ſubſcrib'd by all the allow'd clergy of the nation "Predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation unto life, ſays that article, is the everlaſting purpoſe of God, whereby before the foundation of the world was laid, he hath conſtantly decreed by his counſel, ſecret to us, to deliver from curſe and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation, thoſe whom he hath choſen in Chriſt Jeſus out of mankind, and to bring them by Chriſt unto everlaſting ſalvation, as veſſels made to honour." With this article agree the confeſſion of faith ſet forth by the aſſembly of Divines at <hi>Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minſter,</hi> and alſo their <hi>Catechiſms,</hi> both the larger, and the ſhorter which we receive and teach. This truth ſo aſſerted in our publick ſtandards, I ſhall explain in ſeveral diſtinct propoſitions.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Predeſtination unto life reſpects only <hi>ſome</hi> of mankind It can't reſpect all, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſmuch as all the children of men will not be finally ſav'd. As there are evidently two ſorts of perſons in the world now, good and bad, ſo we are ſure from the word of God there will be found two very different ſorts of perſons at the great day, who will be dealt with after a very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004497_0019_100D30EC74A7D7D8"/>manner; the righteous and the wicked. <hi>Theſe ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſhment, but the righteous into life eternal.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Mat. 25.46.</note> And if all mankind are not finally ſav'd, to be ſure they were not originally predeſtinated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to life; for the decree of God can't be fruſtrated. He hath ſaid, <hi>My counſel ſhall ſtand, and I will do all my pleaſure.</hi> 
                  <note n="‖" place="bottom">Iſa. 46.10.</note> 
                  <hi>There is a remnant,</hi> ſays the apoſtle, <hi>according to the election of grace,</hi> Rom. 11.5. and a rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant can't be all. So in the 11th v. <hi>The election hath obtain'd it, and the reſt were blinded.</hi> The common diſtinction there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore of the elect, and non-elect, is juſt and neceſſary. When ſome are choſen out of many, the reſt muſt of conſequence be left, or the very notion of election is deſtroy'd.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Theſe were <hi>perſonally</hi> choſen and pitch'd upon in the purpoſe and decree of God concerning them. Some will have the election the ſcripture ſpeaks of, to be only of qualifications, and not of perſons; but this is meer evaſion and trifling. The ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture plainly ſpeaks of an election of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. <hi>Whom</hi> he did fore-know, ſays the text, <hi>them</hi> he did predeſtinate. Theſe our ſaviour ſtiles <note n="†" place="bottom">Joh. 17.6.</note> the <hi>men</hi> that the father had
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004497_0020_100D58F78E352948"/>given him out of the world, and their <hi>names</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Rev. 17.8.</note> are ſaid to be written in the book of life from the foundation of the world.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thoſe who are predeſtinated unto life and happineſs as the <hi>end,</hi> are alſo pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated unto faith and holineſs as the <hi>way.</hi> When God chuſes perſons to an end, he alſo determines the means to that end. The ſame decree that predeſtinates any perſons to ſalvation, aſcertains the means of attaining that ſalvation. Theſe, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the conſtitution of the goſpel, are faith and holineſs; and ſo they come under the ſame decree by which any are predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated unto glory. The elect are not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated unto life, provided they perform the conditions of ſalvation, do believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and are holy, in which they are lift entirely to their own will and choice. No; the predeſtination we are ſpeaking of, is no ſuch conditional un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain thing as this makes it to be. The objects of it are by one determinate decree appointed to a certain ſalvation, which they ſhall obtain thro' faith and ſanctifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which are given them in conſequence of the decree, So the Apoſtle tells the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004497_0021_100D58FA7665A4D8"/>believing and ſanctified <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> 2 ep, 2. ch 13 v. <hi>God hath from the beginning cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen you to ſalvation, through ſanctification of the ſpirit, and belief of the truth; whereunto he called you by our goſpel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And our text tells us, whom God fore-knew, he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinated to be <hi>conform'd to the image of his ſon;</hi> in which is included the whole of that work of ſanctification by which they are <hi>made meet for the inheritance of the ſaints in light.</hi> Col. 1.12.</p>
               <p n="4">4. Predeſtination unto life is <hi>from ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting.</hi> Therefore thoſe who are the objects of it, are ſaid to be choſen <hi>before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world,</hi> Eph. 1.4. before the very firſt dawn of time, i. e. from all eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. Tho' there is no inward nor viſible difference between the elect and others, till the grace of God in their effectual calling in time makes it, yet the purpoſe of mercy concerning them was <hi>before the mountains were ſettled, or the hills bro't forth, while God had not yet made the earth, nor the fields, nor the higheſt part of the duſt of the world.</hi> God's purpoſes are, like himſelf, eternal; for, ſuch is his perfection that he comprehends all things referring to his creatures, together and at once, and no new thoughts or deſigns ever come into
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004497_0022_100D58FC98AA58A8"/>his mind, but what were there from eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, in which there is no ſucceſſion. And, O the pleaſure! for any to follow God's thoughts concerning them ſo far back, as to apprehend him ſaying unto them, as to his church of old, <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting love, therefore with loving-kindneſs have I drawn thee.</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Jer. 31.3.</note>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. It is a perfectly <hi>free</hi> and <hi>ſovereign</hi> act of God. His diſtribution of rewards and puniſhments at the laſt day will be founded in juſtice, but his chuſing ſome to make them the objects of his love, and paſſing by others, is founded in his ſovereignty and ſupremacy, whereby he is Lord of all, and accountable to none. This is what proud mortals are loth to ſtoop to, and apt to riſe up againſt; but let us be ſtruck into an awful adoring ſilence, by what the apoſtle ſays of this matter, in Rom 9 ch. from the 14th v. where the divine ſovereignty is both aſſerted and pleaded for. <hi>What ſhall we ſay then? Is there unrighteouſneſs with God? God forbid. For he ſaith to Moſes, I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compaſſion on whom I will have compaſſion. So then, it is not of him that willeth, nor of him
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004497_0023_100D58FF647BFB28"/>that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy.— Thou wilt ſay then unto me, Why doth be yet find fault? For who hath reſiſted his will? Nay, but O man, who art thou that replieſt againſt God? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">
                        <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                     </gap> thing formed ſay to him that formed it, why haſt thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the ſame lump to make the veſſel unto honour, and another unto diſhonour?</hi> The great God was under no neceſſity to chute any of us unto eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. He would have been perfectly bleſſed himſelf, if our whole race had periſh'd for ever. That he has choſen any is owing entirely to the good pleaſure of his will. If he was pleas'd to make choice of any, he was under no neceſſity to pitch upon ſuch and ſuch. All the reaſon to be given is that, <note n="†" place="bottom">Matt. 11.26.</note> 
                  <hi>Even ſo father for ſo it ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth good in the ſight!</hi> There was nothing in the choſen remnant to move God to place his regards upon them before others The ſore ſight of their faith and obedience was not the cauſe; for, as we have had occaſion to hint already, they were choſen <hi>to</hi> faith and obedience, and ſo it could not be <hi>for</hi> them: they are the effects of our election, and therefore cannot be the cauſes of it. God's fore-ſight of their faith and holineſs,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004497_0024_100D5900EB1D0490"/>preſuppoſes his purpoſe to beſtow faith and holineſs on them; an this very purpoſe is a part of their election it ſelf. The apoſtle therefore tells us, Rom. 9.11. That the purpoſe of God according to election, is <hi>not of works, but of him that calleth.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="6">6. It is <hi>certain, infallible,</hi> and <hi>irrevocable.</hi> So are all the decrees of God, and therefore this of Predeſtination unto life. And if it were not ſo, the people of God could not take much comfort from it. God will never go back from his purpoſe to ſave his people; for, <note n="*" place="bottom">Job. 23.13.</note> 
                  <hi>He is of one mind, and who can turn him?</hi> What can induce him to alter his affection towards them? For ſuch is the perfection of his knowledge, that he can never be ſurpris'd by any ſudden new event, that may cauſe a change in his mind and will. He fore-ſaw all the ſins of his people, their undutiful and ungrateful car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage towards him thro' the whole courſe of their lives Now, if the foreſight of them did not hinder his electing love in its riſe, can they fruſtrate its end, the bringing of them to glory? — And whatever they need to have wrought in them, or done for them, is comprehended in one and the

               <p n="5">5. Wherever the goſpel is preach'd there are <hi>ſome</hi> of theſe to be gather'd in by it. It is more than probable that where God ſends a faithful miniſtry, and the goſpel is preach'd in the purity of it, He has a deſign to extend his ſaving grace to ſome among that people, whom he will by ſuch a miniſtry effectually call, and bring home to himſelf. So the apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent to preach the goſpel in <hi>Gorinth,</hi> becauſe God had <hi>much people in that city,</hi> Acts 18.10.</p>
               <p>It follows then, that this is no ſuch diſcouraging doctrine as ſome would repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent it. Since 'tis a ſecret with God who are predeſtinated unto life, and who are not; ſince the number of the elect is ſuch a great number, an innumerable multitude; ſince a part of them are bro't forth in every age; ſince the greateſt ſinners may be of this number, and none are excluded on account of any outward circumſtances; ſince the preaching of the goſpel is the appointed means of gathering them in, and wherever the goſpel is preach'd, we may ſuppoſe there are a number to be bro't by
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004497_0032_100D591413BC5670"/>it to that faith and holineſs, which is the predeſtinated way to eternal life; ſince, I ſay, theſe things are ſo, there is enough to prevent diſcouragement, to raiſe our hope of, and quicken our endeavours after ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</p>
               <p>Therefore our way is, to accept of the general grace offered in the goſpel, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote and reſign our ſelves to God, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the merits of our Redeemer, and put our ſelves under the teaching ſanctify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing influences of his Spirit, in the uſe of the appointed means, humbly waiting for his renewing and reconciling grace: Thus we may come to know the purpoſed love of God to us, that <hi>he hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain ſalvation by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Inſtead then of riſing up againſt, and quarrelling with what we have now heard, let us turn it into a <hi>prayer.;</hi> and there can't be a better prayer after this ſermon, than that which the Holy Ghoſt has put into our mouths, Pſal. 106.4, 5. <hi>Remember me, O Lord, with the favour that thou beareſt unto thy people!

The ſalvation of any of the children of fallen <hi>Adam,</hi> takes its riſe in the eternal counſel, free purpoſe, and electing love of God. Whom
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004497_0034_100D591A11B07140"/>he did <hi>fore-know,</hi> and perſonally chuſe to ſalvation, them he did <hi>predeſtinate</hi> to all the means which lead to that ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

               <p>It was not my deſign, when I began up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on theſe words the laſt Lords-day, to ſpeak of all theſe privileges in the order in which
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004497_0035_100D591B97A00CC8"/>the text preſents them; but only of that which is the ground of them all, and from which the reſt reſult, namely, <hi>Election,</hi> or <hi>Predeſtination unto life;</hi> a plain and precious, but diſreliſh'd and oppos'd truth of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. That I have taken this in hand, I'm ſure is not from a love to controverſy, or fondneſs to oppoſe the ſchemes of others, but, I hope, from a ſincere deſire to <hi>fulfill the miniſtry of the Lord Jeſus</hi> which I have receiv'd among you, by teſtifying <hi>the goſpel of the grace of God</hi> in all the parts of it. We truſt, my Brethren, that we aim to ſpeak, <hi>not as pleaſing men, but God;</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we dare not baulk any truth, in its proper place and ſeaſon, becauſe 'tis un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſhionable, oppos'd by <hi>the wiſdom of the world,</hi> or run down by popular outcry. Nor am I determin'd to this opinion by the prejudice of education, but becauſe after careful ſearches and reſearches, I am convinc'd of the truth of it, upon what appears to me to be the ſtrongeſt evidence; and the more I enquire into it, the more I ſee it to agree with the holy ſcriptures, and the divine perfections.</p>
               <p>It was the buſineſs of the former diſcourſe to explain and ſtate the truth under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. That which we are next to proceed to is to <hi>prove</hi> and <hi>confirm</hi> it. The point then to be now eſtabliſh'd is this,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004497_0036_100D591D415CB1A0"/>"That a certain, great and glorious num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, were elected by God, in his eternal counſel and purpoſe, from the reſt of fallen mankind, to be in time effectually called and juſtified, in order to their being finally bro't to eternal life and glory; and this out of his meer good pleaſure, and for the praiſe of his glorious grace." And if the truth of this is once evinced to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction of a ſober, honeſt, and ſerious mind, it may be hop'd all diſguſt at it will ceaſe, and every thought that <hi>exalts it ſelf</hi> againſt it will be ſuppreſſed.</p>
               <p n="1">I.

And ſurely <hi>he that runs may read</hi> this truth throughout the ſacred pages.</p>
               <p>Let me prepare the way to the more direct and poſitive proof I ſhall fetch from the <hi>bible,</hi> by firſt of all preſenting you with ſome ſcripture inſtances of a <hi>lower election,</hi> of God's chuſing and predeſtinating certain perſons by name, and ſome of them long before they were born, to ſome ſpecial privileges, high honours, and ſignal ſervi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004497_0037_100D591EC8241B40"/>in the world. And if theſe may'nt be taken for poſitive proof of that election we are treating of, yet they will ſerve greatly to illuſtrate it, and they are by very judicious Divines look'd upon as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples and patterns of it, inaſmuch as they plainly ſhew that the glorious God does act with reſpect to the children of men, with a ſovereign liberty, and in a way of diſcriminating favour; yea, many of them were inſtances of the <hi>very election</hi> we are now to exhibit the proof of, inaſmuch as it plainly appears by the account the ſcripture gives of them, that at the ſame time they were called to thoſe external privileges and temporal honours to which they were choſen, they were alſo called to the ſpiritual and ſaving bleſſings of the covenant of grace.</p>
               <p>Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> was pitch'd upon to be the root and father of God's peculiar peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, whom he would own and honour above all the nations of the world; and alſo to be one from whoſe loins the Meſſiah himſelf ſhould deſcend.

               <p>The like ſovereignty was exercis'd in the caſe of <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> whoſe ſtory is recorded in the 25th ch. of <hi>Geneſis,</hi> and is recited and referr'd to by the <hi>apoſtle</hi> in the 9th ch. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> to illuſtrate and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm the truth we are eſtabliſhing.

And if the deſign and meaning of it be enquir'd after, the apoſtle explains it thus, in <hi>Romans</hi> the 9th ch. 11 v. <hi>That the purpoſe of God according to election might ſtand, not of works, but of him that calleth.</hi> i. e. ſays Mr. <hi>Henry</hi> on the place, "That this great truth may be eſtabliſh'd, that God chuſeth ſome, and reſuſeth others, as a free agent,

               <p>And if we look to the poſterity of <hi>Jacob,</hi> the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> this people the Lord choſe in <hi>Abraham,</hi> four hundred years before he publickly own'd them They are expreſly term'd an <hi>elect nation,</hi> as being diſtinguiſh'd from the reſt of the world; an <hi>holy,</hi> ſpecial, and <hi>peculiar</hi> people unto God. When he <hi>divided to the nations their inheritance, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated the ſons of Adam,</hi> He took theſe for his own <hi>portion, the lot of his inheritance;</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Deut. 32.8, 9.</note> tho <hi>the earth was his</hi> to chuſe a people out of to his name.

Becauſe they were <hi>precious in his ſight, and honourable,</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he <hi>gave men for them, and people for their life,</hi> when their preſervation and intereſts call'd for it; yea, he <hi>gave</hi> Egypt <hi>for their ranſom,</hi> Ethiopia <hi>and</hi> Seba <hi>for them.</hi> 
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſa. 43.3.</note> And why did the Lord take theſe? What was there to intitle them to this diſtinguiſhing honour? Did he chuſe them becauſe they were a better people, or a greater nation?
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:004497_0043_100D592DC01D2CC0"/>No ſuch matter. <hi>Moſes</hi> tells them, Deut. 7.7, 8. <hi>The Lord did not ſet his love upon you, nor chuſe you, becauſe ye were more in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber than any people, for ye were the feweſt of all people.</hi> And as their number was ſmall, ſo their diſpoſition was bad and their man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners ill. They were a peeviſh and humourſome people, froward and perverſe, obſtinate and incorrigible; ſtrangely ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted to the idolatries of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and other nations. The Lord fore-ſaw this before he choſe them; for he tells them by the prophet, Iſai. 48.4.8. <hi>I knew that thou wouldeſt deal treacherouſly, and waſt called a tranſgreſſor from the womb. I knew that thou waſt obſtinate, thy neck an iron ſinew, and thy brow braſs. I have even from the beginning declared it unto thee; before it came to paſs I ſhewed it thee.</hi> Therefore the only reaſon aſſign'd why God ſet his love upon them as he did, is this, <hi>becauſe he loved them.</hi> All was from free favour, to manifeſt his ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty, and becauſe he had his elect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, in a ſtill higher and more ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate ſenſe.

               <p>Another remarkable inſtance was <hi>Cyrus.</hi> This man was deſign'd in the purpoſe of God for great and noble work; to deſtroy a mighty monarchy, releaſe God's people out of captivity, and rebuild his temple. It was foretold what great things ſhould be done by him, more than an hundred years before he was born; and he was <hi>called by his name</hi> too: And this not from any wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyneſs in himſelf, for 'tis ſaid he <hi>did not</hi> ſo much as <hi>know the Lord.</hi> This famous

               <p>The prophet <hi>Jeremy</hi> was likewiſe or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain'd to great things before he was born. To him God ſaid, Jer. 1, 5. <hi>Before</hi> I <hi>formed

               <p>And of the apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> the Lord ſaid, <hi>He is a choſen veſſel unto me, to bear my name before the Gentiles, and to ſuffer great things for my names ſake,</hi> Acts 9.15. He, afterwards ſpeaking of his converſion, and call to the poſtleſhip, aſcribes them to the powerful grace of God, in conſequence of his previous purpoſe and fore-ordination. Gal. 1.15, 16. <hi>It pleaſed God, who ſeparated me from my mothers womb, and called me by his grace, to reveal his ſon in me, that</hi> I <hi>might preach him among the heathen.</hi> Now, ſhall we ſay that theſe, and other ſuch inſtances on ſacred record, are to be conſider'd only as hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal relations? Surely that would be too low and narrow a meaning for them. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the apoſtle's reaſoning in the 9th ch. to the <hi>Romans,</hi> in the caſes of <hi>Iſaac</hi> and <hi>Iſhmael, Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau,</hi> it is very plain they were intended for the illuſtrating the methods of God's grace towards particular perſons. And, I think, it is juſtly inferr'd and argu'd, "If there be an election per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal unto things of a <hi>temporal</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and that ſo long before ſome of the perſons were in being, how much more unto things of a <hi>ſpiritual</hi> and eternal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cernment?

               <p>But I proceed to exhibit that more <hi>direct</hi> and <hi>poſitive proof</hi> which the <hi>bible</hi> furniſhes us with. There we read abundantly of an election which can be underſtood of no other than a perſonal election unto eternal life as the end, and unto Chriſt, and faith, and holineſs as the way. And tho' we find this doctrine in the <hi>old teſtament,</hi> in the writings of <hi>Moſes</hi> and the <hi>prophets;</hi> as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from ſome of the ſcriptures we have had occaſion already to mention, and from others which I might turn you to <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Kings 19.18. compar'd with Rom. 11.2, 3.4, 5.

<pb n="43" facs="unknown:004497_0048_100D59391E17E738"/>manifeſt, and things that have been <hi>hid from ages and generations</hi> are diſcover'd.</p>
               <p>I ſhall not diſtribute the ſcriptures I ſhall mention into any other order than that which the <hi>bible</hi> preſents them in: And ſo we muſt begin with ſome paſſages in the diſcourſes of our bleſſed SAVIOUR himſelf, by which it will appear that HE taught this very doctrine; He, who is <hi>the faithful and true witneſs,</hi> and well knew what doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine was ſafe and profitable to teach, as well as true. I think the firſt paſſage we meet with to our purpoſe, if we read the evangeliſts in the order of an <hi>harmony,</hi> is in the ſermon which Chriſt preach'd to the people at <hi>Nazareth,</hi> Luke 4 25, 26, 27. <hi>But I tell you of a truth, many widows were in</hi> Iſrael <hi>in the days of</hi> Elias, <hi>when the heaven was ſhut up three years and ſix months, when great famine was in all the land; but unto none of them was</hi> Elias <hi>ſent, ſave unto</hi> Sarepta, <hi>a City of Zidon, unto a woman that was a widow. And many lepers were in</hi> Iſrael <hi>in the time of</hi> Eliſeus <hi>the prophet, and none of them were cleanſed ſave</hi> Naaman <hi>the Syrian.</hi> The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt deſign of our ſaviour in theſe two examples, is to aſſert the ſovereignty of God in the diſpenſations of his favour; and to let them know, that as the prophet <hi>Elijah</hi> was ſent to relieve a favourite widow, and the prophet <hi>Eliſha</hi> to heal a diſtinguiſh'd
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:004497_0049_100D593B92187DF8"/>leper, ſo he came with a commiſſion and deſign to ſave, not all, but a ſelect number, of the <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles.</hi> And it ſeems they could not bear this doctrine even in thoſe days: For it follows, <hi>And all they in the ſynagogue, when they heard theſe things, were filled with wrath, and roſe up, and thruſt him out of the city, and led him to the brow of a hill, that they might caſt him down headlong.</hi> But this did not cauſe him to ſuppreſs the truth, or wave it, when he had occaſion to mention it, whether in his prayers or ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons. — At a time when he had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving and threatning the places where he had preach'd the goſpel, for their impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitence and unbelief, he comforts himſelf with the thoughts that there was a number upon whom the word had come with a ſaving light and power, purſuant to the purpoſe and pleaſure of the father; whom he adores as the proprietor and diſpoſer of all ſpiritual and heavenly bleſſings, and whoſe free diſpenſation of his ſavours, he moſt heartily approves of, and acquieſes in, Mat. 11.25, 26 <hi>At that time Jeſus anſwered and ſaid, I thank thee, O father, Lord of heaven and earth, becauſe thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed them unto babes. Even ſo, father, for ſo it ſeemeth good in thy ſight!</hi> — At another time when his diſciples expreſs'd them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:004497_0050_100D593EF95B0390"/>ſomething ſurpriz'd that he taught the people in parables, without an expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to let them into the meaning of what he deliver'd to them, explaining things only to their ſmall and ſelect company in a private way, and deſired a reaſon of this his conduct; he anſwers them in ſuch a manner as to let them know, that ſpiritual light and knowledge, a ſaving diſcovery of goſpel truths, were given to ſome, and to themſelves in particular, in a way of free ſpecial diſtinguiſhing favour; but withheld from others according to God's wiſe holy and ſovereign pleaſure: He ſaid unto them, <hi>Becauſe it is given to you to know the myſteries of the kingdom of heaven, but to them it is not given,</hi> Mat. 13.10, 11. — So when, on another occaſion, there were ſome who complain'd againſt the method he obſerv'd in the beſtowment of his bounty and mercy, He in reply to them, vindicates his own right to diſpoſe of the bleſſings of the goſpel as he ſaw meet, becauſe he was the ſovereign proprietor thereof, and none could claim what he did not ſee cauſe to give. Mat. 20.15, 16. <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what</hi> I <hi>will with mine own? Is thine eye evil, becauſe</hi> I <hi>am good?

The choice muſt refer to <hi>ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> and not to the apoſtleſhip, for to this he was choſen, as much as the other apoſtles; wherefore he ſays in another place, <hi>Have not I choſen you twelve, and one

                  <note n="*" place="bottom">It is manifeſt to me, that Chriſt here means a more peculiar and beneficial election, than to the office of Apoſtles; for he had choſen them all to this. But he here ſpeaks of a diſcriminating choice of ſome of them, which did not extend to them all, and particularly to <hi>Judas:</hi> And to ſhew that his knowing whom he had choſen, related not to their temper and diſpoſition, but to the perſons themſelves, he did not ſay, I know, <gap reason="foreign">

GUYSE's excellent Paraphraſe, in the margin.</note> — Our Saviour, as he began, ſo, he <hi>ends</hi> his miniſtry with this doctrine: For his parting prayer with his diſciples, juſt before he left them and the world, is full of it. It is recorded in the 17th ch. of <hi>John's</hi> goſpel; and plainly ſhews that as in his mediatorial undertaking, he was concern'd with a peculiar number given him by way of diſtinction out of mankind in general, ſo theſe only were intereſted in this interceſſory prayer, as thoſe to whom the bleſſings he ask'd for and claim'd, did rightfully belong. <hi>Theſe words ſpake Jeſus, and lift up his eyes to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and ſaid, Father, the hour is come; glorifie thy ſon, that thy ſon alſo may glorifie thee. As thou haſt given him power over all fleſh, that
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:004497_0056_100D594AE12C08F0"/>he ſhould give eternal life to as many as thou haſt given him. — I have manifeſted thy name unto the men which thou gaveſt me out of the world; thine they were, and thou gaveſt them me, and they have kept thy word. I have given unto them the words which thou gaveſt me, and they have received them, and have known ſurely that I came out from thee, and they have believed that thou didſt ſend me. I pray for them; I pray not for the world, but for them which thou haſt given me, for they are thine. Keep thro' thy own name, thoſe whom thou haſt given me. Sanctifie them thro' thy truth. Let them be one, as thou father art in me, and I in thee. Father, I will that they alſo whom thou haſt given me, be with me, where I am, that they may behold my glory which thou haſt given me.</hi> And that none might reſtrain this prayer to the apoſtles, our ſaviour ſhews how extenſive it was in the intention of it; that it inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded all that in every age ſhould obtain the <hi>faith of</hi> God's <hi>elect.</hi> v. 20. <hi>Neither pray I for theſe alone, but for them alſo which ſhall believe on me thro' their word.</hi> — Thus far we have quoted the words of Chriſt Himſelf, the great <hi>prophet</hi> of the church; who, came from the <hi>boſom of the father,</hi> the ſeat of his counſels as well as love, and therefore was well able to reveal the ſecrets of heaven to men upon earth; and <hi>was faithful to him that appointed him, as alſo</hi> Moſes <hi>was faithful in all his houſe.</hi>

The <hi>diſciples</hi> whom our Lord ſent forth to preach under the ſpecial guidance of his ſpirit; and the <hi>apoſtles</hi> who were train'd up for the work of the miniſtry under the <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal inſtructions</hi> of their divine maſter, or were taught the goſpel they were to preach by <hi>immediate revelation</hi> from Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; <hi>they</hi> taught this doctrine after him without the leaſt heſitation, and preach'd and wrote in the ſame ſtrain with him.</p>
               <p>The Evangeliſt <hi>Luke,</hi> (who was very probably one of the ſeventy diſciples, and with good reaſon is ſuppos'd to have wrote the narrative of <hi>the Acts of the Apoſtles,</hi> as well as the third of the four goſpels which bears his name) giving an account of the ſucceſs of the goſpel among the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> upon the <hi>Jews</hi> refuſal of it makes the work of ſaving faith in thoſe in whom it was wro't, to be the reſult of that act of grace which we call predeſtination.

               <p>The apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> the great doctor of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> was a zealous aſſertor of this truth in almoſt all his <hi>epiſtles.</hi> When he writes to thoſe in <hi>Rome</hi> who were <hi>beloved of God,</hi>

The 8th ch. at the 28th v. <hi>And we know that all things ſhall work together for good to them that love God, to them who are called</hi> ACCORDING TO HIS PURPOSE. Then follows the words of our Text <hi>For whom he did fore-know, he alſo did predeſtinate to be conformed to the image of his ſon, that he might be the firſt born among many brethren. Moreover, whom he did pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſtinate, them he alſo called; and whom he called, them he alſo juſtified; and whom he juſtified, them he alſo glorified</hi> And to ſhew the immutability of this electing love of God, and that nothing ſhould hinder the objects of it from being put into the actual poſſeſſion of the grace and glory to which they were deſign'd, he leads them into that noble triumph with which the chapter ends, <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? — Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? — I am perſwaded that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come; nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi> — In the 9th chapter he goes on to <hi>illuſtrate</hi> this
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:004497_0059_100D595282F08870"/>doctrine from particular <hi>inſtances,</hi> and to <hi>vindicate</hi> it againſt ſome <hi>objections. When</hi> Rebecca <hi>had conceived</hi> twins <hi>by our father</hi> Iſaac, <hi>it was ſaid unto her, the elder ſhall ſerve the younger; as it is written,</hi> Jacob <hi>have I loved, but</hi> Eſau <hi>have I hated; tho' the children being not yet born, had done neither good nor evil: That the purpoſe of God according to election might ſtand, not of works, but of him that calleth. What ſhall we ſay then? Is there unrighteouſneſs with God? God forbid. For he ſaith to</hi> Moſes, <hi>I will have mercy on whom I will have mercy, and I will have compaſſion on whom I will have compaſſion. For the ſcripture ſaith to</hi> Pharaoh, <hi>Even for this ſame purpoſe have I raiſed thee up, that I might ſhew my power in thee, and that my name might be declared throughout all the earth. Thou will ſay then unto me, Why doth he yet find fault? For who hath reſiſted his will? Nay but, O man, who art thou that replieſt againſt God? Shall the thing formed ſay to him that formed it, Why haſt thou made me thus? Hath not the potter power over the clay, of the ſame lump to make one veſſel unto honour, and another unto diſhonour?</hi> Some will reply to this, and ſay, It is not a perſonal, but a national preference which is here ſpoken of; and the apoſtle does not refer to <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> in their ſingle capacity, or to the ſpiritual and everlaſting ſtate of either of them; but intends only
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:004497_0060_100D5954CE7C0DB8"/>their poſterity, and the difference made between the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> and the <hi>Edomites,</hi> in the external diſpenſations of providence; which he mentions to juſtifie God, and ſilence the <hi>Jews</hi> from complaining, tho' they were caſt off, and the <hi>Gentiles</hi> called in their room. But tho' <hi>Jacob</hi> and <hi>Eſau</hi> are here ſpoken of with reſpect to their deſcendents, it does not follow that they are not to be perſonally conſider'd alſo; eſpecially ſince <hi>Pharaoh</hi> is mentioned, and bro't in as an inſtance with them. And whoever attends to the manner of the apoſtles diſcourſe, I think muſt ſee that he has ſomething higher than any temporal concerns of men in his eye all along, and refers to their ſpiritual &amp; everlaſting ſtate. Why elſe does he draw that inference from it in the 16 v; <hi>So then it is not of him that willeth, nor of him that runneth, but of God that ſheweth mercy?</hi> And ſpeak in the 22 and 23 verſes, of God's <hi>ſhewing his wrath, and making his power known, on the veſſels of wrath fitted for deſtruction, whom</hi> he here <hi>endured with much long ſuffering;</hi> and his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>playing <hi>the riches of his glory, in the veſſels of mercy, which he had afore prepared unto glory?</hi> In the 11th chap. he further vindicates the divine conduct in caſting off the <hi>Jews,</hi> and reconciles it both with the promiſe made unto the fathers, and with the divine
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:004497_0061_100D59570EA96718"/>goodneſs in general: And he does this by aſſerting <hi>an election of grace</hi> among that people, which wou'd certainly take effect. The rejection, he ſays, was not <hi>total.</hi> They were caſt off indeed, but not <hi>all.</hi> There was a <hi>choſen remnant</hi> among them, that obtain'd righteouſneſs and life by faith in Jeſus Chriſt, tho' the body of that peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple remain'd in unbelief; of which number he reckons himſelf to be <hi>one;</hi> and he ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſts too that it was a <hi>larger number</hi> than ſome might imagine, as was the number of the choſen, preſerv'd and faithful, in the days of <hi>Elias.</hi> From the 1ſt to the 7th v. <hi>I ſay then, hath God caſt away his people? God forbid. For I alſo am an Iſraelite of the ſeed of</hi> Abraham, <hi>of the tribe of</hi> Benjamin. <hi>God hath not caſt away his people which he</hi> FORE-KNEW. <hi>Wot ye not what the ſcripture ſaith of</hi> Elias? <hi>How he maketh interceſſion to God againſt</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſaying, Lord, they have killed thy prophets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they ſeek my life. But what ſaith the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer of God unto him? I have reſerv'd to my ſelf ſeven thouſand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of</hi> Baal. <hi>Even ſo then at this time alſo there is a</hi> REMNANT ACCORDING TO THE ELECTION OF GRACE. <hi>And if by grace, then it is no more of works, otherwiſe grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is no more grace; otherwiſe work is no
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:004497_0062_100D5958C5C94320"/>more work. What then?</hi> Iſrael <hi>hath not ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained that which he ſeeketh for; but</hi> THE ELECTION HATH OBTAIN'D IT, <hi>and the reſt were blinded.</hi>

               <p>He begins his epiſtle to the <hi>Epheſians</hi> with a moſt devout and ſolemn thanks<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giving to God, for thoſe ſpiritual bleſſings wherewith believers are bleſſed; and not only mentions their election and predeſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation as <hi>one,</hi> but as the ſecret <hi>ſpring</hi> from whence all the reſt do flow. Chap 1. V. 3, 4, 5: <hi>Bleſſed be the God and father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual bleſſings in heavenly things in Chriſt:</hi> ACCORDING AS HE HATH CHOSEN US IN HIM, BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD, <hi>that we ſhould be holy, and without blame before him in love: Having predeſtinated us to the adoption of children by Jeſus Chriſt to himſelf, according to the good pleaſure of his will, to the praiſe of the glory of his grace.</hi> Surely this muſt contain much more than their being appointed to the outward privileges of the church ſtate of the goſpel; for tho' this is a great ſavour, yet all who are thus ſavour'd can't be ſaid to be bleſſed with <hi>ALL ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual bleſſings in Chriſt,</hi> as thoſe here ſpoken of are ſaid to be. The apoſtle leaves us at no loſs about the perſons here intended; for he calls them in the 1ſt v. The <hi>ſaints at</hi> Epheſus, <hi>and faithful in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:004497_0063_100D595B83AA4350"/>they are farther deſcribed in the 7th v. as having <hi>redemption thro' his blood, even the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs of ſins;</hi> which things can't be ſaid to belong to thoſe who are no more than viſible or nominal chriſtians —.</p>
               <p>To the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> he writes, as <hi>know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their election of God,</hi> becauſe the goſpel had come to them, <hi>not in word only but in power;</hi> which plainly ſhews ſomething more is intended than their election to the injoyment of the goſpel; for its coming in <hi>word only</hi> would have been a ſufficient proof of that. 1 <hi>Ep.</hi> 1. ch. 45. v. This is farther explain'd, in his 2d epiſtle, the 2. ch. at the 13th &amp; 14 verſes; where the goſpel is conſidered as the means of their attaining that ſalvation which they are ſaid to be choſen to; for he ſays to them, <hi>God hath, from the beginning, choſen you to ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, thro' ſanctification of the ſpirit, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the truth; whereunto he called you by our goſpel, to the obtaining the glory of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt</hi> —. Hitherto our quotations have been out of thoſe Epiſtles of <hi>Paul</hi> which are directed to <hi>churches.</hi> He alſo wrote ſome to <hi>particular perſons;</hi> as to <hi>Timothy</hi> his <hi>own ſon in the faith,</hi> to direct him how to diſcharge his office as an <hi>Evangeliſt:</hi> Him he charges to <hi>hold faſt the form of ſound words,</hi> which he had heard from himſelf;
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:004497_0064_100D595DADBE3098"/>and we find this to be ſome of thoſe ſound words, a part of the chriſtian doctrine in which he inſtituted this young divine; That ſalvation takes its riſe, from the free grace, and eternal purpoſe of God in Jeſus Chriſt. 2 ep. 1 ch. 9th v. <hi>Who hath ſaved us, and called us with an holy calling; not ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to our works, but according to his own purpoſe and grace which was given us in Chriſt Jeſus, before the world began.</hi> That he might be willing to do and ſuffer any thing, to promote the ſalvation of others, he propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to him his own example, in the 2 ch. the 10th v. I <hi>endure all things for the</hi> ELECTS SAKE, <hi>that they may obtain the ſalvation in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> to which they are deſign'd. And leſt he ſhou'd be diſcourag'd when corrupt teachers ſhou'd advance dangerous and deſtructive opinions, as <hi>Hymences</hi> and <hi>Thiletus</hi> had done, and the faith of many nominal chriſtians ſhou'd be <hi>overthrown</hi> by them, he lets him know, That as many as God had ſet apart for himſelf, would be preſerved thro' faith unto ſalvation, v. 19. <hi>Nevertheleſs the foundation of God ſtandeth ſure, having this ſeal, the Lord knoweth them that are his.</hi> Nor does he leave this out of the ſcheme of principles he taught <hi>Titus,</hi> another <hi>Evangeliſt;</hi> whoſe buſineſs was to water the churches planted by the apoſtles, and to ſtrengthen and carry on the work
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:004497_0065_100D595FD73ED610"/>which <hi>they</hi> had begun. In the preface of his epiſtle to him, he ſpeaks of himſelf, as <hi>a ſervant of God, and an apoſtle of Jeſus Chriſt according to the faith of God's elect, and the acknowledging of the truth which is after god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs: in hope of eternal life, which God that cannot lie promiſed before the world began.</hi> In the body of the epiſtle he charges him, to <hi>ſpeak the things which become ſound doctrine;</hi> and not only to inculcate the duties of practical religion, but to ſet forth the free grace of God in man's ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt; and to urge obedience from this peculiar motive of the goſpel, the end of Chriſt's death, <hi>Who gave himſelf for us, to redeem us from all iniquity, and to purifie to himſelf a</hi> PECULIAR PEOPLE, who ſhould be <hi>zealous of good works.</hi> Tit. 1 ch. 1, 2. v. 2 ch. 1. 13, 14. v. 3 ch. 4, 5, 6. verſe.</p>
               <p>There was a union of the other apoſtles with <hi>Paul</hi> in teaching this doctrine. It is more than implied in thoſe words of <hi>James,</hi> (ch. 1. v. 18) <hi>Of his own will begat he us with the word of truth,</hi> &amp;c. His <hi>own will</hi> there, means nothing leſs than his purpos'd grace: It is the ſame with what the apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> calls <hi>his good pleaſure, which he hath purpoſed in himſelf.</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. 1.9.</note> And when
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:004497_0066_100D5962A15E05D0"/>he is warning againſt a partial regarding the rich, and deſpiſing the poor, he ſhews this to be very contrary to God's method in diſpenſing ſpiritual favours. The 2d ch. 5th v. <hi>Hearken my beloved brethren, hath not God</hi> CHOSEN <hi>the poor of this world, rich in faith, and heirs of the kingdom which he hath promiſed to them that love him?</hi>

The teſtimonies ſhall finiſh with <hi>John,</hi> as his writings cloſe the book of God. He was eſpecially the diſciple of love, and his <hi>epiſtles,</hi> as well as his goſpel, breath the electing love of God. In his firſt epiſtle the 14th ch. the 19th v. He makes the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent eternal love of God to <hi>us,</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the incentive, but the <hi>riſe</hi> and <hi>ſpring</hi> of the believers love to <hi>him; We love him, becauſe he firſt loved us.</hi> And he inſcribes his ſecond epiſtle, to an honourable matron, whom he calls <hi>the elect Lady;</hi> not only a choice one, but one choſen of God — Nor is the book of the <hi>Revelation which Jeſus Chriſt made to him</hi> ſilent about this truth. There we are told, <hi>That all that dwell in the carth ſhall worſhip the beaſt,</hi> and be deceived by ſatan, either in doctrine or practice, to their perdition, excepting thoſe <hi>whoſe names are written in the lambs book of life from the foundation of the world;</hi> 13th ch. 8. v. 17. ch. 8 v.

<pb n="65" facs="unknown:004497_0070_100D59689F79E838"/>moſt high God, and that in the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent and tranſcendent degree. For, if every creature derives its being from God, as the firſt cauſe, then no creature can poſſibly be poſſeſs'd of any excellency, but what muſt, in the higheſt and moſt abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſenſe, belong to God — Now, no one can deny that it is an excellency in any creature to be wiſe and powerful; wiſe to lay a ſcheme of what he intends to do and powerful to perform and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh what he deſigns. For a rational being to ſet about a work, without firſt forming in his mind a <hi>model</hi> of what he intends to purſue, is to diſcover a defect of wiſdom; as not to be able to accompliſh the plan he hath laid down, bewrays a want of power. — Theſe premiſes being granted which indeed cannot be denied, it muſt follow, that whatever the great God does he deſign'd to do; and whatever he deſign'd to do he does. For, to ſuppoſe God to perform any work which he did not before deſign to perform, is to charge him with a degree of folly, and with acting below an intelligent agent; as to ſuppoſe him to deſign a thing which he does not effect, is to tax him with impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. If then it is an inſtance of the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and power of man, firſt to deſign a work, and then to perfect it, the great God,
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:004497_0071_100D596B5D299380"/>who is infinite in both theſe perfections, muſt deſign what he effects, and effect what he deſigns. To this deciſion of <hi>reaſon</hi> the ſacred ſcriptures bear their teſtimony in the fulleſt and ſtrongeſt manner. With how much majeſty does the great God deliver himſelf in thoſe words, Iſai. 46, 10, 11? <hi>I am God, and there is none elſe; I am God, and there is none like me; declaring the end from the begining, and from ancient times, the things that are not yet done, ſaying, My counſel ſhall ſtand, and I will do all my pleaſure.</hi> — To apply this to the great work of fallen man's redemption. Either God actually ſaves all men, or he does not; if he does, he muſt have deſign'd it; if he does not, 'tis plain he never deſign'd it. All that God deſign'd to ſave, he ſaves; but he actually ſaves <hi>ſome</hi> only, therefore he deſign'd only to ſave ſome of fallen <hi>Adam's</hi> children. Now, if we conſider God as infinite in wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and of almighty power, there cannot be a more rational way of arguing, than from his acts to his deſigns."</p>
               <p n="2">2. The very <hi>Fore-knowledge</hi> of God ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues the ſame thing. That <hi>known to God are all his works from the begining,</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts 15.8.</note> will be
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:004497_0072_100D596CE25CEBB8"/>eaſily granted. Few, if any among us, are diſpos'd to deny this, That God did from all eternity fore-know who ſhou'd be ſaved. He muſt then fore-know that the requiſite qualifications to ſalvation ſhou'd be found in them; that they wou'd <hi>repent,</hi> and <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve,</hi> and <hi>obey the goſpel;</hi> for none can be ſav'd without theſe. And ſince the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is plain that theſe are God's <hi>gift,</hi> of <hi>his working</hi> wherever they are found, he cannot be ſaid to have fore-known that theſe wou'd ſo repent and believe, without an unalterable <hi>determination</hi> in his own mind to <hi>beſtow</hi> theſe ſaving graces on <hi>them in particular.</hi> Therefore, Fore-knowledge and predeſtination are link'd together in our text, <hi>Whom he did fore-know, them he did predeſtinate.</hi> I take this argument to be concluſive. It is that upon which the great Doctor <hi>Twiſs</hi> mainly reſts the cauſe, in his learned defence of this truth againſt the oppoſers of his day. And it was this convinc'd the celebrated Dr. <hi>South,</hi> and brought him into thoſe principles called <hi>Calvinian.</hi> It will not be foreign to my purpoſe, and poſſibly it may more than inform and pleaſe ſome, if I ſhou'd inſert a ſhort account of that matter into this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. I have it then from very good
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:004497_0073_100D596EB714CCB0"/>authority, <note n="†" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Calamy</hi>'s continuation of the account of the <hi>ſilenced</hi> miniſters, Vol. 1ſt. p. 146.</note> that this eminent perſon, ſometime after the reſtoration, being in company at <hi>Oxford</hi> with ſeveral perſons of note, and among the reſt with Mr. <hi>Thomas Gilbert,</hi> who was afterwards one of the <hi>ejected</hi> miniſters, they fell into a converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion about the <hi>arminian</hi> points. And altho' it was more than ſuſpected that Dr. <hi>South,</hi> who fell in with the new conformity, did alſo incline to the new divinity of that time, yet upon Mr <hi>Gilberts</hi> aſſerting that the <hi>Predeſtination</hi> of the <hi>Calviniſts</hi> did ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily follow upon the <hi>Preſcience</hi> of the <hi>Arminians,</hi> the Doctor preſently engag'd that if he would make that out, he would never be an <hi>Arminian</hi> ſo long as he liv'd. Mr <hi>Gilbert</hi> immediately undertook it, and made good his aſſertion to the ſatisfaction of thoſe preſent; and the <hi>Doctor</hi> himſelf was ſo convinc'd, as to continue to the laſt a very zealous aſſertor of the reform'd doctrine againſt its various oppoſers — And thus the truth we are maintaining may be argued from the divine perfections.</p>
               <p n="3">III. It may alſo be argued from the <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſations of providence and grace;</hi> in giving
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:004497_0074_100D59719AA3CF18"/>the goſpel to ſome people, and not to others; and in bleſſing the preaching of it for ſaving good to ſome who enjoy it, and not to others.</p>
               <p n="1">1. In <hi>giving the goſpel to ſome</hi> and not to others. In order to compleat the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of men, the redemption purchaſed muſt be applied; and in order to this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication there are means appointed and made neceſſary by God's inſtitution: theſe are the word and ordinances of the goſpel. For, as ſays the apoſtle, Rom. 10.14. <hi>How ſhall they call on him in whom they have not believed? And how ſhall they believe in him, of whom they have not heard? And how ſhall they hear without a preacher?</hi> Now, the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel of ſalvation is ſent to ſome places, and not to others; and this by a <hi>ſpecial provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence.</hi> Not only the doctrine, but the <hi>journeys</hi> and <hi>travels</hi> of the apoſtles, were under the direction of the ſpirit of God. Acts 16.6, 7 <hi>Now when they were gone throughout</hi> Phrygia, <hi>and the region of</hi> Galatia, <hi>and were forbidden of the Holy Ghoſt to preach the word in</hi> Aſia, <hi>after they were come to</hi> Myſia, <hi>they aſſayed to go into</hi> Bithynia: <hi>but the ſpirit ſuffered them not.</hi> Agreably when the apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was preaching the goſpel at <hi>Antioch,</hi> he told the people of that place (Acts, 13.26.) <hi>Men and brethren, to you is the word of
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:004497_0075_100D5974603DC8C0"/>this ſalvation</hi> SENT. Not ſo much bro't by us as ſent by God. And this diſpoſition of providence cannot be accounted for but by an election of grace to be gather'd in from among ſuch a people. This was given as the reaſon why <hi>Paul</hi> was ſent to preach the goſpel at <hi>Corinth,</hi> Acts 18.9, 10. <hi>Then ſpake the Lord to</hi> Paul <hi>in the night by a viſion, ſaying, Be not afraid, but ſpeak, and hold not thy peace, for I am with thee, and no man ſhall hurt thee; for I</hi> HAVE MUCH PEOPLE <hi>in this city.</hi> And ſo the preaching of the goſpel in other <hi>Gentile</hi> places is accounted for, Acts 15.14. James <hi>anſwered ſaying, Ye have heard how God hath viſited the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>to take out of them a people for his name.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. In <hi>bleſſing the means of grace</hi> for ſaving good to <hi>ſome</hi> who enjoy them, and not to others. <hi>The wind blows where it liſteth;</hi> and the holy ſpirit works by the miniſtry of the word, <hi>to will and to do, of his own good plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Phil. 2.13.</note> 
                  <hi>One</hi> is awakn'd, convinced, <hi>pricked to the heart</hi> by a ſermon; <hi>another</hi> in the ſame ſeat, under the ſame ſermon, feels nothing. Sometimes the moſt <hi>unlikly</hi> are taken and effectually called, while others are left: And this after many years delay and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement,
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:004497_0076_100D597685038220"/>and no hopeful proſpect, but the contrary. Some out of <hi>wicked families</hi> are converted; others, after a ſtrict and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious education, become vile and profli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate. What <hi>different ſucceſs</hi> hath the goſpel at ſome times, and in ſome places; and at different times in the <hi>ſame</hi> place? Tho' the ſame meſſage, and the ſame preacher. Is there not an open <hi>diſplay</hi> of the ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reignty of divine grace in all this? Surely the converſion of ſinners is <hi>according to his purpoſe,</hi> as to the <hi>ſubjects</hi> themſelves, and alſo as to the time and ſeaſon of their change, and the means and method by which it is accompliſhed.</p>
               <p>Once more,</p>
               <p n="4">IV. Such an election as we are treating of, is <hi>neceſſary to ſecure to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt what he purchaſed by his death.</hi> It wou'd be very diſhonourable to ſuppoſe that Chriſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook the great and difficult work of mans redemption; that he came into our world, ſuffer'd and died, upon <hi>an uncertainty</hi> what the effect of his redemption wou'd be; for this is plainly to make him act below a wiſe intelligent agent. This could no ways be <hi>aſcertain'd</hi> but by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine fore-ordination; for otherwiſe it muſt be left to turn upon the corrupt fallacious will of man. If men were left to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, ſuch is their <hi>impotency</hi> to what is
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:004497_0077_100D59780A4889B0"/>good in their preſent fallen ſtate, and ſuch a <hi>ſtrong biaſs</hi> are they under to the world and ſin, they wou'd never comply with the terms of ſalvation; and ſo muſt fall ſhort of it after the purchaſe of it was made. Therefore a ſpecial number were choſen, and given to Chriſt, with reſpect to whom the father engag'd, that they ſhou'd be bro't to believe on him, and be <hi>a ſeed to ſerve him</hi> in this world, and thro' his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits obtain to everlaſting bleſſedneſs in the world to come. We are told in the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which God hath made to us of <hi>the hidden myſtery which God ordain'd before the world unto our glory,</hi> that the ſucceſs of his redeeming work was aſcertain'd to our redeemer, in an inviolable contract, upon his engaging in the great &amp; glorious deſign. Iſai. 43.10, 11, 12. <hi>When thou ſhalt make his ſoul an offering for ſin, He ſhall ſee his ſeed: the pleaſure of the Lord ſhall proſper in his hand. He ſhall ſee of the travel of his ſoul and be ſatisfied: By his knowledge ſhall my righteous ſervant juſtify many. Therefore I will divide him a portion with the great, and he ſhall divide the ſpoil with the ſtrong: becauſe he hath poured out his ſoul unto death.</hi> It was upon the aſſurance our bleſſed ſaviour had given him in this contract, that he ſpoke thoſe words, John 6.37. <hi>All that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giveth me,</hi> SHALL <hi>come to me.</hi> Thus I have
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:004497_0078_100D597A87BB81E8"/>confirmed the truth we are maintaining, by what I take to be direct ſcripture proof, and ſolid argument agreable to ſcripture. And if the truth is once well eſtabliſh'd, there is the leſs need to regard the objections bro't againſt it. Yet, I hope, thro divine aſſiſtance, in the next diſcourſe to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate this doctrine, in ſome meaſure, from the charges bro't againſt it, as if it argu'd unrighteouſneſs in God, diſcourag'd per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons from uſeing the means of ſalvation, tended to deſpair, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>In the mean time, let what we have now heard cauſe us humbly to bow down be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the throne of the divine ſovereignty, and awfully to adore in the apoſtles lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, Rom. 11. from the 33d v. <hi>O the depth of the riches both of the wiſdom and knowledge of God! how unſearchable are his judgments, and his ways paſt finding out! For who hath known the mind of the Lord, or who hath been his counſeller? Or who hath firſt given to him, and it ſhall be recompenſed unto him again? For of him, and through him, and to him are all things: to whom be glory forever.</hi> AMEN.</p>

                  <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE words have been the foundation of two diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes already, upon this illuſtrious Doctrine of chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity, That a certain num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber were ſelected by God, in his eternal counſel and purpoſe, from the reſt of fallen mankind, to be in time effectually called, ſanctified and juſtified, in order to their being finally bro't to eternal life and glory; and this out of his meer good pleaſure, and for the praiſe of his glorious grace.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="unknown:004497_0080_100D597F65E98548"/>
This truth has been explained &amp; ſtated in ſeveral propoſitions. It has alſo been confirmed &amp; eſtabliſhed by poſitive ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture proof, and by ſome arguments drawn from the ſcriptures. That which we are to proceed to at this time is,</p>
               <p n="3">III. To attempt to clear this truth of ſome <hi>miſrepreſentations</hi> made of it; and to give an anſwer to the <hi>objections</hi> commonly bro't againſt it.</p>
               <p>Here I would firſt of all obſerve to you, We ſhou'd not diſown or relinquiſh a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine we have been taught, becauſe of ſome objections rais'd againſt it, or difficulties attending it. For there is no one truth in all the <hi>bible,</hi> tho' never ſo plainly laid down, but the corrupt, proud, and aſpiring mind of man, has formed ſome objections againſt it, and ſtarted ſome difficulties a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it. And if we can't quite maſter all the difficulties, and reconcile every thing that ſeems contradictory, we muſt not therefore withold our aſſent, if the thing it ſelf is expreſly reveal'd in ſcripture, or neceſtarily inſer'd from it. We are indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſably obliged to believe whatever God has reveal'd, whether it is obvious to our reaſon, and agrees with our preconceiv'd opinions, or not. If we can but ſatisfie
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:004497_0081_100D5980ED1BA350"/>our ſelves the ſcripture aſſerts ſuch a doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, the obſcurity, difficulty, and harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, which ſeem to attend it, muſt not ſtumble or offend us. For theſe are things which are to be receiv'd upon the credit of him that reveals them; and we don't yield that <hi>obedience of faith</hi> which the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel requires, unleſs our <hi>underſtandings</hi> ſubmit to a revealed truth, as readily as our <hi>wills</hi> are to comply with a commanded duty.</p>
               <p>It is ſcripture and not reaſon, that is the rule of faith: For we are incompetent judges of revealed truths, not only on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the narrowneſs of our capacities, but becauſe of that <hi>blindneſs of mind</hi> which is the conſequent of our fallen ſtate.</p>
               <p>Nor yet is the unſearchableneſs of a doctrine reveal'd in ſcripture, a ſufficient reaſon why we ſhould forbear all <hi>inquiry into it,</hi> or <hi>diſcourſe about it.</hi> What we may not pretend to ſearch out to perfection, or to explain the <hi>modus</hi> of, we may yet know and ſpeak ſo much of, as to ſubſerve the great ends of religion. And if it is not the object of inquiry, nor a ſit ſubject of diſcourſe, to what end is it reveal'd at all? We are ſoon loſt in the <hi>perfections of the divine nature,</hi> as well as in the <hi>doctrine of the decrees;</hi> yet <hi>they</hi> muſt not be let alone,
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:004497_0082_100D598272EC4528"/>if we would teach people what they are to believe concerning God.</p>
               <p>Tho' there are bounds ſet about the holy mount, and to <hi>break thro' to gaze,</hi> is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and may be fatal; yet, keeping a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per diſtance, we may allowably take a view of what is preſented before us; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out affecting to be <hi>wiſe above what is writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> we may ſafely venture to go into a myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious ſubject as far as the ſcripture leads us, <hi>compareing ſpiritual things with ſpiritual:</hi> And by going <hi>into the ſanctuary of God,</hi> we may gain ſome ſatisfaction about what is otherwiſe <hi>two painful</hi> for us.</p>
               <p>Having ſaid this by way of premiſe, I come directly to what we propos'd, to vindicate the preſent truth from ſome of the miſrepreſentations made of it, and to anſwer ſome objections made againſt it.</p>
               <p n="1">1. To vindicate it from ſome <hi>miſrepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentations</hi> For diſtinction is always to be made between the objections to which a truth may be liable, and the miſrepreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which are ignorantly or maliciouſly made of it. Some greatly miſrepreſent this doctrine, and ſtate it in ſuch a manner as we are far from allowing, but utterly diſown and reject as well as themſelves.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="78" facs="unknown:004497_0083_100D5985DF1561D8"/>
Thus,</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some repreſent the doctrine of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as God's ordaining to ſave ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular perſons <hi>let them live how they will.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But no ſuch election as this was ever aſſerted by <hi>us.</hi> The ſcripture knows no ſuch election. and <hi>we</hi> are far from main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining it. The ſame decree that deſigns any perſons to ſalvation, aſcertains the means for the obtaining that ſalvation: Theſe are faith and holineſs. God hath choſen us to ſalvation <hi>thro' ſanctification of the ſpirit, and belief of the truth.</hi> And the elect of God <hi>are predeſtinated to be conformed to the image of his ſon,</hi> which takes in the whole work of ſanctification. And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we never ſaid, that if a perſon was elected he might be ſaved however he or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered his life; for this wou'd be to ſeparate what God has indiſſolubly connected, and to deſtroy a part of the decree itſelf.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Another miſrepreſentation is, when any ſpeak as if the decree of God was <hi>the Reaſon why men did continue in ſin &amp; unbelief.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Give me leave to reply to this in the words of another. <note n="*" place="bottom">Dr. <hi>Ridgley,</hi> by way of reply to Dr. <hi>Whitby.</hi> See his body of divinity, Vol. 1ſt p. 230.</note> 
                  <q>Indeed, the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:004497_0084_100D598764F17560"/>reaſon why any repent and believe to eternal life, is becauſe the exceeding greatneſs of his power is exercis'd to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards them, whereby he works repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and faith in them; and the reaſon of his exerting this power to work theſe ſaving graces in them, is becauſe he has determined to do it; and ſo 'tis the execution of his purpoſe. But it does not follow from hence, that the reaſon why others do not repent &amp; believe is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they were not ordain'd to eternal life. Tis true, their not being ordain'd to eternal life, or God's not having pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to ſave them, is the reaſon why he does not exert that power which is neceſſary to work repentance and faith in them; and impenitence and unbelief will certainly be the conſequent hereof; but the immediate ſpring and cauſe of impenitence and unbelief, is the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and perverſeneſs of human nature, which is chargable on none but man himſelf. We muſt certainly diſtinguiſh between impenitence and unbelief their being the <hi>conſequent</hi> of God's not work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing repentance and faith, and its being the <hi>effect</hi> hereof. If God withholds his grace from ſome to whom he was not oblig'd to give it, and they continue in ſin, this is to be aſſign'd only to that
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:004497_0085_100D5989ED726A28"/>wicked propenſity of nature, which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clines us to ſin, and not to the divine efficiency;</q> for the decree enforces no man to ſin, as we ſhall have occaſion to ſhew hereafter.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another ſuch groſs miſrepreſentation of this doctrine is, when any ſpeak as if the aſſertors of it held, that men are damn'd <hi>by vertus of the decree,</hi> without any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of their <hi>ſin</hi> and <hi>miſcarriages.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But this was never ſaid by the moſt zealous aſſertors of election and reproba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We do indeed affirm that God of his meer ſovereignty choſe ſome to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life, and paſſed by others, without any conſideration had to the good works of the former, or the evil deeds of the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; but then a diſtinction is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween bare <hi>non-electing,</hi> and the <hi>decree of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. This,</hi> being a thing more poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive in the nature of it, muſt be with a view to ſin committed, and from the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſight of it. The objects of the decree of condemnation muſt be ſome way or other, obnoxious to juſtice, that the righteouſneſs of God may be intirely clear in the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of intellectual creatures.

                  <q>That in no moment of time or reaſon doth God ordain any man to damnation, before the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of ſin.

               <p>Doctor <hi>Edwards,</hi> another ſtrenuous and learned defender of predeſtination, ſays, <note n="*" place="bottom">In his <hi>Veritas Redux,</hi> p 163, 164.</note> 
                  <q>It is a true propoſition, that God never decreed to make any creature everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly miſerable, who by his voluntary
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:004497_0087_100D598F74A39DD0"/>tranſgreſſion of the divine laws, did not deſerve it. To damn, being an act of punitive juſtice, ſuppoſes a fault, implies ſome demerit. <hi>Tribulation and anguiſh to every ſoul of man that worketh evil,</hi> Rom. 2.9. <hi>All are under ſin,</hi> Rom. 3.9. <hi>That every month may be ſtopped, and all the world may become guilty before God,</hi> v. 19. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the penal decree hath reſpect to this.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And our venerable <hi>Willard</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">In his <hi>Expoſitory Lectures,</hi> p. 270.</note> ſpeaks the ſame language, when he ſays, <q>God in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to damn none but for ſin. Dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation is not an act of meer ſovereignty, but of relative juſtice. God damns none meerly becauſe he will damn them, but becauſe they have bro't it upon them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. As in Jer. 2.17. <hi>Haſt thou not procured this unto thy ſelf, in that thou haſt forſaken the Lord thy God?</hi> Sin therefore is the only cauſe of men's deſtruction. It is true, there is an infallibility of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence upon reprobation, that all who are under that decree will die; but they do not die becauſe they were reprobated, but becauſe they ſinned. And were it not ſo, revenging juſtice would not be manifeſted in this. For, juſtice appears
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:004497_0088_100D59919E335E78"/>in rewarding men according to their doings, judging by the law which they are under. That juſtice then may take place, it muſt appear that the man really deſerves the penalty in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on him Now this deſert ariſeth from the nature and merit of ſin: the man then muſt be a ſinner before he can be juſtly damned; and if he be ſo, he then rightly deſerves it. So we read, Rom. 6.23. <hi>The wages of ſin is death; but the gift of God is eternal life, thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</hi> So that notwithſtanding the decree, no one falls under this ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, till by his ſin he hath brought it upon himſelf. No man is doom'd to hell and deſtruction, becauſe he was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probated, but becauſe he was a ſinner and deſerv'd it</q>
               </p>
               <p>Having ſo far clear'd the doctrine of theſe miſrepreſentations that are made of it,</p>
               <p>We come,</p>
               <p n="2">II To return ſome anſwer to the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections</hi> that are commonly offer'd againſt it.</p>
               <p>And</p>
               <p n="1">1. Some object againſt the doctrine of election, or God's free choice of ſome of fallen mankind, to make them the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of his grace now, and heirs of glory hereafter, while he paſſed by the reſt, and left them in the ruins of their apoſtacy; ſome
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:004497_0089_100D599409F2FF40"/>object againſt this, as inconſiſtent with the <hi>juſtice</hi> and <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of God. Why, ſay they, ſhou'd he chuſe ſome and not others, to make them the objects of his redeeming love and grace, when all were alike miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and equally undeſerving? Does not this make him a reſpecter of perſons? Whenas we are told, Acts 10.34. <hi>Of a truth God is no reſpecter of perſons;</hi> and he has ſtrictly forbidden this in <hi>earthly judges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To this it may be anſwer'd, That reſpect of perſons which is blam'd amongſt men, is when one is prefer'd before another, in a matter of <hi>right,</hi> for ſome ſiniſter and ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh ends; as when a judge <hi>favours the rich in his cauſe:</hi> but this is not chargeable where a perſon is under no obligation by any law or rule, but is at perfect liberty. Thus tho' a man that is a judge, muſt do alike by all, when he diſpenſes juſtice; yet a man is at liberty to take into his houſe and family whom he pleaſes, or to beſtow his eſtate on whom he will. If that place in Acts 10.34.35. where the apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> ſays, <hi>Of a truth I perceive that God is no reſpecter of perſons: But in every nation, he that feareth him, and worketh righteouſneſs, is accepted with him,</hi> is duly conſider'd, it will appear that it does not intend but that God does ſhew favour to ſome above
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:004497_0090_100D599653786BB8"/>others; but all that it means is this, that God reſpects no man's perſon, either leſs or more, for his <hi>outward condition &amp; carnal priviledges.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, it is certain that God's election had no regard to any thing in the creature, to any deſervings found in the objects of it; for all lay in one corrupt maſs when the decree was exercis'd about them, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they have excellent above others is the fruit of their election, and ſo not the cauſe of it.</p>
               <p>The glorious God was at perfect liberty, being a debtor to none He is ſovereign Lord of his own grace, and may certainly beſtow it where he will. None could lay claim to it, and therefore none are wrong'd if it is not beſtowed on them; tho' all are highly favour'd who are the partakers of it.</p>
               <p>Shall it be reckon'd an act of injuſtice in God to ſave ſome of mankind only, when he might have left ALL to periſh, as well as the fallen angels, and not recover'd ſo much as ONE of our apoſta<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">

                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> his own grace and glory as he pleaſeth? When he is a debtor to none but makes that open challenge, <hi>Who hath firſt given to him, and it
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:004497_0091_100D5997D8CCA5E8"/>ſhall be recompenced to him again?</hi> Our ſavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our hath ſaid eno' to ſilence this objection, in Mat. 20.15. <hi>Is it not lawful for me to do what I will with mine own? Is thine eye evil becauſe I am good?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. This truth is further objected againſt as being inconſiſtent with the <hi>goodneſs</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> of God. They ſay, <hi>God's tender mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies are over all his works;</hi> that he is repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented in ſcripture as a great lover of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and as having <hi>no pleaſure in the death of a ſinner</hi> but a deſire that he ſhould <hi>live.</hi> How then can it be that his ſaving deſign is reſtrain'd to any determinate number, while the reſt are left to periſh everlaſting<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly? And ſome are ready to think and ſay, what is even horrible to repeat, that it taxes a merciful God with the cruelty of making man to damn him.</p>
               <p>To this I anſwer,</p>
               <p>However great the goodneſs and mercy of God are, yet all his creatures in miſery do not equally partake in them. This is plain from the diſtinction that is made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the fallen angels and fallen mankind. The fallen angels are wholly paſs'd by, and not one of them ſaved; and this to be ſure, without any derogation to the mercy of God. Yet there is as much reaſon to charge God with want of goodneſs and
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:004497_0092_100D5999F2B8A650"/>mercy, in leaving all the fallen angels to periſh, as in paſſing by ſome of fallen mankind. Or will any preſume to affirm that God is unmerciful, becauſe he chooſes the objects of his mercy, or <hi>has mercy on whom he will have mercy?</hi> The <hi>power</hi> of God is limited and determin'd in the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it, by his divine wiſdom and ſover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eign pleaſure; and why ſhould not his <hi>goodneſs</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> be ſo too?</p>
               <p>Nor does this give occaſion for that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious and blaſphemous reflection, that God made ſome men to DAMN them. For God's purpoſe to condemn men, does not conſider them as <hi>creatures,</hi> but as <hi>ſinners;</hi> as we have had occaſion to obſerve already. That God did not create man on purpoſe that he might ſin, is evident from man's primitive ſtate, that of innocence, in which he might have continued. For tho' his creator made him <hi>mutable,</hi> he yet made him <hi>upright</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Eccle. 7.29.</note>, without the leaſt tincture of ſin in his nature, or any diſpoſition, or inclination to it; but all the powers and faculties of the ſoul were diſpos'd to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the ends of its creation, and thereby to glorifie God. Now, as God did not
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:004497_0093_100D599B78836070"/>create man that he might ſin, he cannot be ſaid to create him that he might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn him: <q>Several other ideas inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vene between God's purpoſe to create and to condemn.</q>
               </p>
               <p>And tho' the merciful God does not take pleaſure in the death of a ſinner, as 'tis the miſery of his creatures, yet he has, <hi>and from the perfection of his nature cannot but have,</hi> a high ſatisfaction in the diſplay of his own juſtice towards ſome, whoſe ſin has render'd them the proper objects for that terrible attribute to be glorified upon. Beſides, theſe ſame objections taken from the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and mercy of God, lie as much againſt God's not eventually ſaving all, as his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination not to ſave all. None ſay that all men will be <hi>finally</hi> ſaved; for the ſcripture declares the contrary in many places. Yet 'tis certain, God cou'd ſave all men if he ſo pleaſed. He cou'd change the heart of every ſinner in the world, prepare him for ſalvation, and then beſtow it on him. Is it any derogation to his goodneſs and mercy that he don't do thus? Why then do any charge the opinion of God's determining to ſave but a part of mankind, with ſuch unmercifulneſs, when the objection lies full as ſtrong againſt their own opinion, that God will <hi>actually ſave but a part</hi> of our ſpecies?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="unknown:004497_0094_100D599DEAD39F80"/>
Nor do we by this opinion make ſalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion narrower, or more confin'd, than thoſe who oppoſe it; but, in fact, make it as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive in its ſubjects as they do. As one has well obſerv'd upon this argument, <q>The difference between them and us, is not about the number that are ſav'd; we both agree in this, that none ſhall be ſav'd but ſuch as repent and believe, and obey the goſpel, and that all ſuch ſhall certainly be ſaved; but what we differ about is, the manner of their obtaining ſalvation. We ſay, they are ſav'd by virtue of the electing love of God; they ſay they are ſav'd becauſe they rightly improve their own free will. We affirm them to be ſav'd in ſuch a way as aſcribes all to the glory of God; the way of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation which they hold is ſuch, as leaves great room for man to glory. Thus far then our doctrine appears every whit as merciful to mankind as theirs, inaſmuch as the difference is not about the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the ſav'd, but the way and man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their coming to this ſalvation. Nay, our doctrine appears much <hi>more merciful</hi> than theirs who oppoſe it. For ours makes the ſalvation of millions of the fallen children of men <hi>abſolutely cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain,</hi> while theirs makes the ſalvation of any man, but <hi>barely poſſible</hi> And let any
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:004497_0095_100D59A14C2BAD48"/>unprejudic'd perſon judge, whether a doctrine that ſecures the ſalvation of an innumerable multitude, is not more worthy of a compaſſionate and merciful God, than a notion that only puts the ſalvation of every one upon a bare poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility, whence it may happen, that even according to their own tenets, no one may be ſav'd at laſt.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Nay the author we here refer to <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Sladen.</hi>
                  </note> car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries the matter ſtill higher, and with good reaſon aſſerts, <q>That the doctrine of our <hi>opponents is an unmerciful doctrine,</hi> becauſe it is ſo far from aſcertaining the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of any, that it makes the ſalvation of each man <hi>a moral impoſſibility.</hi> They ſuppoſe the election the ſcripture ſpeaks of to be only a conditional one, i. e. provided men will repent and believe, and perſevere in holineſs; but they will not allow that God has predeſtinated any <hi>to</hi> faith, repentance, and perſeverance to the end; but that the performance of theſe conditions depends upon their own will.</q>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <q>But if this is the caſe, the queſtion which was once put to our Lord, may
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:004497_0096_100D59A2D23DDC60"/>very properly be ask'd here, <hi>Who then can be ſaved?</hi> For, if the ſcripture has rightly repreſented men as by nature in a ſtate of <hi>death,</hi> to <hi>every good work repro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate; not ſufficient as of themſelves</hi> to ſpeak a good <hi>word,</hi> or think a good <hi>tho't,</hi> how is it poſſible they ſhou'd by their own innate power ever perform theſe great and weighty conditions?</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus our doctrine appears to be not only conſiſtent with the mercy of God, but to give it a brighter diſplay. And I would only add upon this; It is the <hi>grace</hi> and <hi>mercy</hi> which I ſee ſhining forth in this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine, that makes me embrace it, and prize it, and contend for it. And however others may judge, I declare with all ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, I wou'd not for ten thouſand worlds but my own ſalvation ſhou'd ſtand more ſecure, than any will or power of my own is able to make it.</p>
               <p>To go on.</p>
               <p n="3">3. It is objected againſt the truth we are maintaining, that it is inconſiſtent with <hi>human liberty,</hi> and tends to eſtabliſh a <hi>fatal neceſſity</hi> of things. Some will ſay, if men are predeſtinated to faith and holineſs, a force is then put upon their inclinations, and a free choice taken away: As on the other hand they ſay, this brings men under
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:004497_0097_100D59CC8E2477D8"/>a neceſſity of ſmning; and why are they to be blam'd or puniſh'd for what they cannot help? Nay, ſome will venture ſo far as to ſay, that upon this principle God himſelf muſt be the author of ſin, or the blameable cauſe of evil.</p>
               <p>I anſwer, To reconcile the divine fore-ordination with human liberty, is a thing too hard for us; nor may any one pretend to do it. Yet <hi>the matter of fact is certain,</hi> that men do act with liberty and freedom in things that are fore-ordained. And tho' <hi>we</hi> can't reconcile them, there is certainly an agreement between theſe two. Nor is it more difficult to reconcile this, than ſome other things which yet are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally own'd. As for inſtance, the duty and ſucceſs of <hi>prayer</hi> with the doctrine of God's <hi>unchangeableneſs.</hi> Such is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of God's nature that he is unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in his mind and purpoſes. When he is ſaid in ſcripture to repent or change his mind, 'tis only ſpoken after the manner of men; and can by no means be underſtood as if he had alter'd his purpoſe upon any <hi>new proſpect,</hi> or was bro't to do otherwiſe than he before deſign'd; for this wou'd plainly be to derogate from the perfection of his nature. Yet <hi>prayer</hi> is the appointed means of receiving mercy and bleſſings
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:004497_0098_100D30F563E8CB78"/>from God, and he does many things for his people in anſwer to their prayers, and has <hi>never ſaid to the ſeed of</hi> Jacob, <hi>ſeek ye me in vain.</hi> Now I ſay, 'tis no more difficult to reconcile the divine fore ordination with human liberty, than it is the doctrine of the divine unchangeableneſs with the efficacy of prayer. And ſo there is no more reaſon to reject the doctrine of the <hi>divine decrees,</hi> than there is the doctrine of the <hi>divine unchangableneſs,</hi> which even rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon teaches.</p>
               <p>Tho' the elect of God are predeſtinated to faith and holineſs, no violence is offer'd to their wills when they come to believe in Chriſt, and chuſe the way of holineſs. Tho' all that the father hath given him, ſhall come to Chriſt, yet they come freely, not by a <hi>force upon</hi> their wills, but <hi>a change</hi> in them. Surely God may incline the wills of men, without deſtroying the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and freedom of them. So we road, <hi>Thy people ſhall be willing in the day of thy power,</hi> Pſal. 110 3. And God tells his people, <hi>I have loved thee with an everlaſting love; therefore with loving kindneſs have I drawn thee.</hi> And the church prays, <hi>Draw me, we will run after thee,</hi> Cant. 1 4. On the other hand, Tho' the decree of God leaves ſome unto the ſinfulneſs of their own hearts and lives, out of which he is
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:004497_0099_100D59A5D1508E60"/>under no obligation to recover them, yet this enforces no man to ſin; but men's ſin is always voluntary and choſen. So 'tis ſaid of God's ſinful people of old, Iſai. 66.3. <hi>They have choſen their own ways, and their ſoul delighteth in their abominations.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>To illuſtrate and confirm this, let me refer you to the ſtory of <hi>Joſeph,</hi> which pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents us with a notable draught &amp; ſcheme of providence. God had a purpoſe to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance <hi>Joſeph</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and alſo a deſign to ſave his fathers houſe alive in a time of famine, by ſending him there before them to make proviſion for them; and as a <hi>means</hi> to this <hi>Joſeph</hi> was ſold to the <hi>Iſhma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lites,</hi> and by them to an officer in <hi>Pharaohs</hi> court. But will any one ſay that his brethren did not act freely in their ſelling of him, and gratifie their own envy and malice by that wicked deed?</p>
               <p>So our Lord Jeſus Chriſt was <hi>the lamb ſlain from the foundation of the world,</hi> in the divine counſel and purpoſes; yet 'tis ſaid of the <hi>Jews</hi> that <hi>for envy they delivered him to</hi> Pilate, Mat. 7.18. And the apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> thus charges them, Acts 2.23. <hi>Him, being delivered by the determinate counſel and fore-knowledge of God, ye have taken, and by wicked hands have crucified and ſlain.</hi> The crime is expreſly ſaid to be their own, tho' done in purſuance of the divine determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="95" facs="unknown:004497_0100_100D59A75A4A54D8"/>
Nor can the holy God be made the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of ſin when he leaves the ſinner to his ſinfulneſs: For tho' he permits the ſin, he <hi>infuſes</hi> no ſinfulneſs into the ſinner.</p>
               <p>"Will any ſay, God's denying the reveng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful perſon, or the murderer, that grace which would prevent his executing his bloody deſigns, makes him the author of the murder? Or is his denying to others the neceſſary ſupply of their preſent exigen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, the cauſe of their making uſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful means, by plundering and ſtealing, to ſubſiſt themſelves? No, this is only to be aſſign'd to that wicked propenſity of nature, which enclines to ſin when occaſion is offer'd, &amp; not to the divine efficiency."</p>
               <p n="4">4. It is objected that this doctrine of particular election is inconſiſtent with ſuch declarations in ſcripture as thoſe that tell us, God is not willing any ſhou'd periſh, but wou'd <hi>have all men to be ſaved;</hi> and with ſuch expoſtulations as God uſes with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, and lamentations over them, when he ſays, <hi>Turn ye, turn ye, why will ye die?</hi> And, O <hi>that thou hadſt known in this thy day, the things of thy peace!</hi> And alſo with ſuch general offers of grace as that, <hi>Whoſoever will let him take of the water of life freely.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="97" facs="unknown:004497_0101_100D59A981C1D440"/>
This may ſeem a plauſible objection at the firſt ſound, but upon due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration will not be found to overthrow what we aſſert. For as to ſuch <hi>declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> as this that God wou'd have <hi>all men to be ſaved,</hi> and therefore <hi>to come to repentance,</hi> they cannot be underſtood to be any thing more than declarations of mens duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent &amp; turn to God that they may be ſaved, and that the thing in it ſelf conſider'd is to be deſir'd. They can't poſſibly mean that he wills the repentance and ſalvation of all as he does of ſome; that he wills it as a thing which he will engage his power to accompliſh; for then it would immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately come to paſs. — The <hi>expoſtulations</hi> we meet with in ſcripture, are forms of ſpeech well ſuted to awaken men's conſideration, bring them to a ſenſe of their duty, and excite them to return to God; and are of this uſe in the hand of the Spirit, in the effectual calling and converſion of God's elect. — The <hi>lamentations</hi> that are made over ſinners, repreſent the deplorableneſs of their condition, and that God has no pleaſure in their miſery conſider'd as his creatures. If they are look'd upon as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſenting God diſappointed in, and griev'd at a thing which he cou'd not help, and has come to paſs contrary to his deſign and expectation, they are certainly ſtrain'd too
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:004497_0102_100D59AD190AB4A0"/>far. — And as to the <hi>offers of grace</hi> in the preach'd goſpel, <hi>they</hi> are and muſt be ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, for the elect and non-elect live to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether under the ſame goſpel, and none but God knows who the one and the other are. Theſe free and general offers are for the encouragement of perſons awaken'd &amp; in diſtreſs, and they prevent the returning ſinner from deſponding. There is indeed no <hi>deceit</hi> in theſe offers: <hi>Whoever will</hi> may <hi>take of the water of life freely.</hi> But when any are willing to accept of ſalvation in the way in which it is offer'd in the goſpel, they are made ſo by God, and 'tis in pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuance of his purpoſe. We are ſure there is no inconſiſtency between particular elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and a general promiſe, ſince our ſavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our aſſerted the former at the ſame time that he made the latter, in that famous place, which we have once and again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to, John 6 37. <hi>All that the father giveth me, ſhall come to me. And him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> From hence I ſay, it inconteſtibly appears, That a determinate infallible election is not inconſiſtent with a free general offer of grace I ſhall mention but one objection more, which is,</p>
               <p n="5">
                  <hi>5thly</hi> That this doctrine <hi>diſcourages per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> in the uſe of means, and tends to <hi>deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair.</hi>
                  <pb n="98" facs="unknown:004497_0103_100D59AEA0EBBC00"/>If I am not elected may a perſon ſay, to what purpoſe are all my endeavours for ſalvation? I can never attain to it by them. And if I am elected, why ſhou'd I ſtrive and labour, when my ſalvation is made ſure by the immutable decree of God? But, how prepoſterous is this, when the end &amp; means come under the ſame decree? As I have had occaſion once and again to obſerve in the proceſs of this ſubject. God's decree does not at all take off the uſe of our endeavours, for in the uſe of the means the very decree it ſelf is to receive its ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhment. Let me refer you to a ſcripture ſtory for the illuſtration &amp; proof of this. When the apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was in im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent danger of ſhipwrack in his voyage to <hi>Rome,</hi> he encouraged the company by aſſuring them, there <hi>ſhou'd not be the loſs of any man's life, only of the veſſel.</hi> For ſays he, <note n="†" place="bottom">Acts 27.23, 24.</note> 
                  <hi>There ſtood by me this night the angel of God, whoſe I am, and whom I ſerve, ſaying, fear not</hi> Paul, <hi>thou muſt be brought before</hi> Ceſar: <hi>and lo, God hath given thee all them that ſail with thee. Wherefore ſirs be of good cheer: for I believe God, that it ſhall be even at it was told me</hi> Yet when the <hi>ſhipmen</hi> were by and by going <hi>to flee out of the ſhip</hi> to ſave
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:004497_0104_100D59B0AE8DCD08"/>themſelves by <hi>boat,</hi> Paul <hi>ſaid to the centurion, and to the ſoldiers, except theſe abide in the ſhip, ye cannot be ſaved.</hi> Which did not at all weaken the aſſurance he had juſt before given them from God, that they ſhou'd all be ſaved; for God who had appointed the end, that they ſhou'd be ſav'd, had alſo ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed the <hi>means,</hi> that they ſhou'd be ſaved by the help of thoſe ſhip-men: ſo tho' God has ordained the ſalvation of thoſe that ſhall be ſaved, he has ordain'd it in the way of faith and holineſs, and a <hi>working out their own ſalvation with fear &amp; trembling.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is no ſuch decree as this, That the elect ſhall be ſaved, whether they work about their own ſalvation, or not. Or, that the elect may continue unconverted, and unconcern'd about eternal bleſſedneſs, and yet get ſafe to heaven at laſt. If any are ordain'd unto eternal life, it is alſo ordain'd that they <hi>ſhall be awakn'd</hi> to a ſence of their ſin and miſery, to earneſt prayer to God for recovering &amp; renewing grace; and to a diligent waiting on him in the ways of his appointment, until that he have mercy on them. How then does this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine ſet aſide the uſe of means in order to attain the end?</p>
               <p>If any make this a plea for not ſetting about the work of their ſalvation, 'tis only
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:004497_0105_100D59B4B876F0D8"/>an excuſe for ſloth, and a meer pretence for their not doing what they have <hi>no mind</hi> to do. For they do not urge and plead the decree in other and leſſer matters, as they do in the matters of their ſalvation. Other things are fore-ordain'd as well as men's ſalvation; how long they ſhall live, and whether they ſhall be rich and proſperous in the world But who ſays, I don't know whether God has decreed that I ſhall live to be old, and therefore I will not take food to preſerve my life, nor phyſick to recover me when I am ſick? Or, I don't know whether the decree will allow me to proſper, or not; and therefore I will not work nor trade, nor uſe any endeavours to get an eſtate. If any object the decree in the one caſe, that do not in <hi>the other,</hi> ſurely they are ſelf-condemned.</p>
               <p>And how can this doctrine have a peculi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ar tendency to drive perſons to <hi>deſpair,</hi> when it aſcertains ſalvation to a <hi>very great number,</hi> an <hi>innumerable multitude;</hi> and no one knows but <hi>he</hi> is of that number? For it is a very great ſin for any one to conclude himſelf a reprobate. The <hi>greateſt</hi> and the <hi>oldeſt</hi> ſinner may not do ſo. For many of the elect of God have been left unto great ſins, and ſuffer'd to lie long in ſin too; but been after all bro't <hi>to the faith of God's elect,</hi> been <hi>waſhed, ſanctified</hi>
                  <pb n="101" facs="unknown:004497_0106_100D59B643570AA0"/>and <hi>juſtified</hi> in this world, and <hi>glorified</hi> in the next. And if the ſinner <hi>is</hi> awakned, and bro't into diſtreſs and agony, there is <hi>the more hope</hi> that he will be found of this number, and that a purpoſe of mercy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning him is <hi>beginning</hi> to be executed. How in the world does this doctrine tend to deſpair any more than thoſe places of ſcripture that ſpeak of the difficulty of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, and tells us that few comparitively will be ſaved? Such paſſages as that in our ſaviours ſermon on the mount, Mat. 7.13, 14. <hi>Enter ye in at the ſtrait gate; for wide is the gate, and broad is the way that leadeth to deſtruction, and many there be which go in there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>at: Becauſe ſtrait is the gate, and narrow is the way which leadeth unto life, and few there be that find it.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But 'tis eaſy to load any truth with miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentations and abuſes if men will ſet themſelves to do ſo: and ſuch is the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs of ſome, that they will give a wrong turn to a thing that is never ſo well explain'd and guarded. When we ſet forth the <hi>mercy</hi> of God, his readineſs to pardon, and willingneſs to receive ſinners that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to him by repentance and faith in Jeſus Chriſt; ſome will abuſe it to <hi>preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> and from thence encourage themſelves to go on in ſin becauſe grace abounds, and to defer their repentance to the laſt of their
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:004497_0107_100D59B7F2146F40"/>time. This, ſo far as we can make a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a more <hi>common</hi> caſe than the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and 'tis full as <hi>dangerous</hi> to the ſouls of men: Yet none would have us forbear it; and ſome think it can't be too often treated of, nor eno' enlarg'd upon.</p>
               <p>Indeed it is a uſual thing for perſons under their firſt awakenings, to have their minds exercis'd about the doctrine of elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; but ſo far as I have been able to ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, it has been a <hi>help,</hi> rather than an hindrance, to them in the work of a tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough converſion, and ſaving cloſure with the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; and has been us'd by the Holy Spirit as a means to excite them to give <hi>more diligence</hi> to make their calling ſure, and to lay <hi>the ſtronger hold</hi> on the hope ſet before them, in a glorious Chriſt to whom the goſpel invites them to flee for refuge.</p>
               <p>And it ſeems to me that upon a fair and juſt repreſentation of the ſtate of the caſe, it will appear to every conſiderate and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prejudic'd perſon, that a miniſter in treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with troubled awakned conſiences, can do it with much greater advantage upon the foot of <hi>particular election,</hi> and thoſe o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther doctrines of grace that are connected with it, than on the foot of <hi>univerſal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,</hi>
                  <pb n="103" facs="unknown:004497_0108_100D59BA2D535520"/>and the opinions that follow that. For, ſuppoſe a perſon in deep concern a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout his everlaſting ſalvation, ſhou'd come to a miniſter for his help and direction, and the miniſter ſhould tell him; God was a kind and merciful being, who delighted in the happineſs of his creatures, and made none of them miſerable that did not make themſelves ſo; and Chriſt was the ſaviour of the world, who died for all men, and conſequently for him as much as for any one; and if he did but repent of his ſins, and truſt in the merits of Chriſt, and lead a good life, and continue to do ſo to the end, he need nor fear, for the goſpel pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mis'd ſalvation to him. Might he not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply? And if his concern was deep and tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rough, he would reply to this effect; Tho' God <hi>is a kind and merciful being,</hi> 'tis as true that he is ſo holy as to hate ſin, and ſo juſt as to puniſh the ſinner; and how much ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever he <hi>delights in the happineſs of his creatures,</hi> we know it will be the portion of a great many of them to be everlaſtingly miſerable: True, <hi>he makes none of them miſerable that don't make themſelves ſo;</hi> but this is my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy caſe: I ſee I am a ſinner, tho' I was not ſo ſenſible of it as I am now; I have revolted from him and rebelled againſt him; and I fear he will make me as miſerable, as I have made my ſelf ſinful. And if Chriſt <hi>is
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:004497_0109_100D59BDA5F1B6F0"/>the ſaviour of all men,</hi> all men will not be actually and finally ſaved by him; this ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral redemption leaves the ſalvation of all men at an uncertainty. If I could know he died for <hi>me</hi> in particular, I ſhould think my ſalvation ſecur'd; but I have no reaſon to think he died for me any more than for thoſe who will periſh forever. As to that <hi>faith, repentance and obedience,</hi> which the goſpel makes the conditions of an intereſt in ſalvation by Jeſus Chriſt, whatever un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due opinion I have had of my own ſtrength before, I am now convinc'd theſe are things out of my power, and muſt be wro't in me by a divine energy. I find my heart to be hard and unbelieving, averſe to the way of holineſs, and only bent to ſin. And there are ſo many evil inclinations to be denied, temptations to be reſiſted, and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to be overcome, that <hi>I</hi> fear <hi>I</hi> ſhall not hold out in the way to heaven; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out <hi>I</hi> endure to the end, <hi>I</hi> can't expect to be ſaved. Others have turn'd back, after they have ſeem'd to ſet out well; and <hi>I</hi> have no better ſecurity than they had. My ſalvation, for any thing <hi>I</hi> can ſee, is very uncertain; yea, very unlikely, and next to impoſſible, if <hi>I</hi> am left ſo much to my ſelf in it.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="105" facs="unknown:004497_0110_100D59BF2B4F9DB0"/>
On the other hand; When a miniſter tells an inquiring, ſolicitous, anxious ſoul, not only that the death of Chriſt is of value ſufficient to purchaſe ſalvation for all men, if God had been pleas'd to deſign the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of all; but that he died to render the ſalvation of a very great number of them infallibly certain; and therefore has purchas'd for every one of theſe that faith &amp; repentance which the goſpel makes neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſalvation, which are moſt commonly wro't in them by the HolySpirit in the uſe of the appointed means; and that their final perſeverance in grace, and compleat victory over ſin, the world, and ſatan, are ſecured in a well order'd covenant, of which the Lord Jeſus Chriſt himſelf is the head and ſurety: and if when the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring perſon expreſles a doubt &amp; fear that he is not one of the happy number, &amp; ſeems ready to be diſcourag'd on this account, the miniſter further lets him know, there is no real ground for any ſuch fear, inaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>much as none can tell who are included in this number, and who are not; and many are included in it who have greatly fear'd the contrary; that the preſent concern of mind he is under renders it very hopeful that he will be found of this number at laſt, inaſmuch as this is the way of the Spirit with the elect of God, when he is about
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:004497_0111_100D59C0B1D01EF8"/>effectually to call them; firſt to awaken them out of their former eaſe and ſecurity, to convince and humble them, and ſo drive them to Chriſt: That if he goes to Chriſt for life upon the general call of the goſpel, his election of God is put out of queſtion; and then he need not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged on account either of his unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thyneſs or inability; for the promiſes of effectual and perſevering grace made to Chriſt in behalf of the elect are abſolute, and he may plead them, and take the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of them, and reſt aſſured that as Chriſt will caſt out none that come to him, ſo it is not <hi>the will of his father in heaven, that one of theſe little ones ſhould periſh</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Mat. 18.14.</note>; and therefore he has undertaken to perfect that which does concern them, to compleat the good work begun in them, to protect and guide them thro' this evil world, and carry them ſafely to the kingdom prepared for them. — When, I ſay, a miniſter applies himſelf in this manner, upon theſe princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, to an awakened diſtreſſed ſoul, does it not carry greater encouragement, &amp; ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er conſolation in it, than the other, which only makes the ſalvation of all men poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, but ſecures ſalvation to none of them;
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:004497_0112_100D59C31F1C89E0"/>and leaves them ſo much to themſelves in a difficult and hazardous work, to which they know &amp; find they are ſadly unequal?</p>
               <p>Thus an anſwer has been given to ſome of the more common objections bro't againſt this truth. But I have not yet gone thro' all that <hi>I</hi> propos'd; tho' <hi>I</hi> have endeavour'd to be as comprehenſive as <hi>I</hi> could. Another diſcourſe muſt be allow'd me: In which <hi>I</hi> ſhall endeavour to improve the ſubject to the ends of practical religion; and perſons may be directed how to make their election ſure; for a perſon will never be thro'ly reconcil'd to this doctrine, till he has a hope of his own intereſt in it. <hi>Conſider of what has been ſaid, and the Lord give you underſtanding in all things;</hi> eſtabliſhment in this, and every other goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel truth. <hi>This alſo we wiſh,</hi> brethren, <hi>even your</hi> growing up towards <hi>perfection,</hi> in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and faith, together with holineſs and comfort. We wou'd not have you always as <hi>babes</hi> to be <hi>fed with milk,</hi> but as <hi>men in Chriſt</hi> to be able to receive and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt theſe truths which the apoſtle calls <hi>ſtrong meat.</hi> 'Tis a mean and a low thing for a chriſtian to be content to know no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but what is neceſſary to ſalvation. There are many truths reveal'd in the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, which we can't ſay are abſolutely ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:004497_0113_100D59C68BF0EA50"/>to ſalvation, which yet 'tis a ſhame for chriſtians not to have the knowledge of, becauſe they redound to the honour of God, and have an influence into ſome parts at leaſt of practical religion. And if theſe are among <hi>the deep things of God,</hi> let it not diſcourage you from a humble cautious ſearch into them by the light of ſcripture, and with prayer to the ſpirit of truth, to lead you into all truth.</p>
               <p>I conclude now with the apoſtles prayer for the <hi>Philippians,</hi> 1 chap. 9, 10, 11. v. <hi>This I pray that your love may abound yet more and more in knowledge, and in all judgment; that ye may approve things that are excellent;</hi> (or, as the margin reads it, <hi>try</hi> things that <hi>differ;) that ye may be ſincere and without offence till the day of Chriſt; being filled with the fruits of righteouſneſs, which are by</hi> Jeſus Chriſt, <hi>to the praiſe and glory of God.</hi> AMEN.</p>

                  <hi>I</hi> hope now to finiſh the ſubject as God ſhall vouchſafe to help. And the next thing we are to proceed to according to the method we at firſt propos'd is,</p>
               <p n="4">IV. To ſet before you ſome of the <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurd conſequences</hi> which follow upon the denial of this doctrine, and the <hi>difficulties</hi> of which the contrary ſcheme labours, and with which they are embarraſs d who are on the other ſide of the queſtion. This, <hi>I</hi> apprehend, will caſt ſome more light into the ſubject, and further confirm the truth we are maintaining; and it may help to undeceive ſome who have been ready to think all the difficulty lies on our part, and there is little or nothing for our opponents to reconcile, or to clear away, before this notion can be embrac'd.</p>
               <p>And</p>
               <p n="1">1. If ſuch an election as we have been ſpeaking of is not granted, it follows, That <hi>the will of God,</hi> even in an affair wherein his own glory is ſo greatly concern'd as the ſalvation of men, is <hi>dependent on the will of the creature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I think the more general ſcheme of thoſe who cannot ſubſcribe to the doctrine of election is, That God has not infallibly will'd the ſalvation of any particular per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons,
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:004497_0116_100D30F3CD4B61A0"/>but conditionally will'd the ſalvation of all men; that is, provided they will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent, and believe: but has not determin'd to give this repentance and faith to any in particular; at leaſt not till he ſees how they improve the common grace and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages they are under. This is evidently to make the will of God in this matter, ſubject to, and directed by the will of man, which is very diſhonourable to him. This notion repreſents God, as ſaying, "I will that all men ſhould be ſaved; nevertheleſs it muſt finally be, not as <hi>I</hi> will, but as they will." This is in effect to take away the will of God; for, to be ſure he can have no abſolute will of his own, whoſe will muſt be directed by the will of another, and is liable to be fruſtrated by it.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Without ſuch an election as we are maintaining, God <hi>might</hi> be wholly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointed in his ſaving deſign reſpecting the children of men, and the precious blood of Chriſt <hi>might</hi> have been ſhed in vain. The o ne could not be ſecur'd, nor the other prevented, without an election of individuals, to whom the redemption pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd by Chriſt ſhou'd be infallibly applied.</p>
               <p>They will not get clear of this abſurd conſequence, by having recourſe to the
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:004497_0117_100D59D031F619A0"/>fore-knowledge of God, and ſaying, he cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly fore-knew that ſome, and a great number wou'd repent and believe, and ſo was aſſur'd he ſhou'd not be diſappointed in his deſign, and that his ſon would not die in vain; becauſe, as we have ſhown already, the fore-knowledge of God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily infers his fore-ordination: for it is certain, that when all things <hi>future</hi> were no where but in the mind of God, in the days of eternity, he cou'd know nothing of them but what was his determinate will and counſel concerning them.</p>
               <p>Or if they will ſay, that to prevent this diſappointment, God will ſo order it that ſome ſhall be inclin'd and diſpos'd to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with the terms of ſalvation; this is in effect to give up the point, and grant what we aſſert: for this will be to allow <hi>diſcrimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nating grace exercis'd in time,</hi> which can't well be defended without allowing a <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination in God's purpoſe</hi> relating thereto; becauſe they muſt otherwiſe ſuppoſe there are new determinations in the divine will, which wou'd be to argue him imperfect in wiſdom and knowledge.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Another of the groſs abſurdities which I apprehend follows upon the denial of this doctrine is, That man's ſalvation is
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:004497_0118_100D59D1B760B648"/>left at the ſame uncertainty under the <hi>new covenant,</hi> that it was in under the <hi>firſt;</hi> nay, that the ſtate of mankind <hi>now,</hi> is much more difficult and dangerous than it was then.</p>
               <p>Man's happineſs, or miſery, turned upon the exerciſe of his own free will under the firſt covenant; and ſo it does ſtill if the ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of a number is not ſecur'd by elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting love and grace. And can we ſuppoſe it conſiſtent with the love and kindneſs of God, to leave ſalvation again to depend upon the will of man, which had ruin'd him once before? If free-will ruin'd man in his <hi>firſt ſtate,</hi> while he was <hi>upright;</hi> is it not much more likely to ruin him in his <hi>worſt ſtate,</hi> now that he is <hi>fallen</hi> and <hi>corrupt?</hi> How can we imagine the wiſe God to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect his deſign of man's ſalvation ſhou'd be anſwer'd in the ſame way, when it was ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered much more unlikely; I may ſay impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible now, tho' it was not ſo before? Agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably we read, Job 15.15. <hi>Behold, he putteth no truſt in his ſaints.</hi> He does not truſt the concerns of his glory in their ſalvation, in their own hands; for he well knew his ſaving deſign wou'd then never take effect. And therefore their ſalvation is infallibly ſecur'd by the new covenant, which is call'd a <hi>better covenant, eſtabliſh'd upon better
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:004497_0119_100D59D34745E0A0"/>promiſes;</hi> promiſes of reconciling, renewing and perſevering grace, poſitive and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute, <hi>Heb.</hi> 8.6. A tranſcript of which co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant follows, in the 10, 11, &amp; 12. v. and it runs in the moſt abſolute unconditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal ſtrain that can be; <hi>This is the covenant that I will make with them, ſaith the Lord, I will put my laws into their minds, and write them in their hearts; and I will be to them a God, and they ſhall be to me a people. And they ſhall not teach every man his neighbour, and every man his brother, ſaying, Know the Lord: for all ſhall know me, from the leaſt to the greateſt. For I will be merciful to their unrighteouſneſs, and their ſins and their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will I remember no more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Once more,</p>
               <p n="4">4thly, Another of the conſequences, which, as I conceive, follows upon the denial of this doctrine is, That the ſalvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of every <hi>particular man</hi> does <hi>originate</hi> with himſelf; or at leaſt is to be <hi>divided</hi> between God and the creature.</p>
               <p>They that are in the other way of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſuppoſe that by the death of Chriſt mankind are put into a ſalvable ſtate; but that the ſucceſs <hi>as to particular perſons</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon their acceptance of the offer'd ſalvation, and compliance with the terms of it; which acceptance and compliance
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:004497_0120_100D59D56EA77758"/>(according to them) are not the reſult and fruit of God's purpoſe of grace, but rather of mens own reaſon and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, will and choice excited by thoſe rational arguments that have been ſet before them, and that moral ſuaſion which has been uſed with them. Some of theſe will indeed ſpeak of the <hi>grace of God,</hi> and acknowledge we can do nothing without <hi>that;</hi> but all they ſeem to mean is a <hi>common general grace</hi> which goes along with the goſpel, and one may improve to equal advantage as another. — And if it be thus, the ſinner that is ſav'd, is furniſh'd with an eaſy anſwer to that queſtion, 1 Cor. 4.7. <hi>Who maketh thee to differ from another?</hi> The happy difference inſtead of being aſcrib'd to the free and powerful grace of God, muſt upon this principle, be aſcrib'd to the man himſelf, his own reaſon and choice, good conduct and endeavours. There is no <hi>medium</hi> here; for according to the apoſtles arguing, every mans ſalvation takes riſe from the free grace of God in election, or from his own works. Rom. 11.5, 6. <hi>Even ſo at this time alſo there is a remnant according to the election of grace. And if by grace,</hi> (ſuch as I mention'd juſt now, vi z. electing grace; <hi>if by grace,</hi> I ſay) <hi>then it is no more of works; otherwiſe grace is no more grace. But if it be of works, then it is
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:004497_0121_100D59D7902FB128"/>no more grace; otherwiſe work is no more work.</hi> But that doctrine which gives the creature ſo much room to boaſt, and put in for ſo great a ſhare in the honour of his own ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, cannot be of God; for he will not have any thing of his <hi>glory given to another.</hi> And nothing can be more contrary to the deſign of the goſpel, which is to ſtain the pride of all fleſh, to take away all occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of glorying from the creature, and to ſecure to divine grace its full honours. The prophet ſhews the glory and tendency of the goſpel ſtate, when he ſays, as in Iſa. 2.17. <hi>The loftineſs of man ſhall be bowed down, and the haughtineſs of men ſhall be made low, and the Lord alone ſhall be exalted in that day.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The exaltation of FREE GRACE is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently what the glorious God aims at in the contrivance of fallen man's redemption. To this the whole frame is admirably fitted, from the firſt corner ſtone, to the bringing forth the top ſtone thereof. 1 Cor. 1.29, 30, 31. <hi>That no fleſh ſhou'd glory in his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence. But of him are ye in Chriſt Jeſus, who of God is made unto us wiſdom, and righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and ſanctification, and redemption: That, according as it is written, He that glorieth, let him glory in the Lord.</hi> Eph. 2.7, 8, 9. <hi>That in the ages to come he might ſhew the exceeding riches of his grace, in his kindneſs towards us,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:004497_0122_100D59D9AD2D52A8"/>through Chriſt Jeſus. For by grace are ye ſaved, through faith; and that not of your ſelves: it is the gift of God: Not of works, leaſt any man ſhould boaſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>And ſo we proced to the</p>
               <p n="5">V. general head, which is, To ſhew the <hi>importance</hi> of this doctrine, and the place it holds in the ſcheme of chriſtianity; by which you will be help'd to judge whether it is a doctrine that had better be ſuppreſs'd than publiſh'd in the church. But here I muſt be content with hinting at things, without enlargment, or I ſhall much exceed my limits.</p>
               <p>To be ſure; The <hi>goſpel</hi> can't be fully preach'd if this article is dropt; for it is evidently a great part of the ſubject matter of the ſacred pages.</p>
               <p>We can't rightly conceive of the <hi>attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butes</hi> of God, if we are unacquainted with this doctrine. — It is in this decree of election, that ſeveral of the glories and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellencies of the divine nature, appear in their brighteſt and ſtrongeſt light. As to the <hi>Jovereignty</hi> of the great God, his abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute ſupremacy over all creatures, and right to diſpoſe of them for his own glory; <hi>this</hi> is left out of the notion men frame of God, and he quite looſes the glory of this
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:004497_0123_100D59DB6F144EA0"/>high prerogative, when this truth is not underſtood and acknowledg'd —. And as to the divine <hi>goodneſs, mercy</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing diſplays theſe ſo much, as the ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting purpoſe of God to deliver ſo many of the children of <hi>Adam,</hi> from the miſery they had involv'd themſelves in, and the puniſhment they had deſerv'd. To deliver ſome, and not all, renders the divine good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs towards the ſubjects of this deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, more perſpicuous and glorious. The ſalvation of men wou'd not ſo fully appear to be from <hi>free mercy</hi> and <hi>grace,</hi> if no differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was made between perſons. To this purpoſe the apoſtle ſpeaks, Rom. 11.23. <hi>That he might make known the riches of his glory on the veſſels of mercy, whom he had afore prepared unto glory.</hi> His making choice of <hi>ſome,</hi> while he paſſes by others, commends his favour to <hi>them,</hi> renders it more glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous in their eyes, conſtrains their admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion now, and will raiſe their higheſt notes of praiſe hereafter. The eternal melody they will make, is that, Rev. 5.9. <hi>Thou art worthy to take the book, and to open the ſeals thereof: for thou waſt ſlain, and haſt redeem'd us to God by thy blood</hi> OUT OF <hi>every tongue, and kindred, and nation.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Many of the peculiar, high and noble, inſtructive and comfortable <hi>doctrines</hi> of the
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:004497_0124_100D59DD02E009C8"/>goſpel are concern'd in this, and connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it. What will become of that <hi>covenant of redemption</hi> between the father and the ſon from the days of eternity, of which we read in the 89th <hi>Pſalm;</hi> 53d ch. of <hi>Iſaiah;</hi> 10th and 17th ch. of <hi>John,</hi> and other places; if a diſtinguiſh'd number were not given to Chriſt, as his charge, and as his reward? — The <hi>ſatisfaction of Chriſt</hi> is rendred a very looſe uncertain and unſafe thing, if there are not a certain number for whom it was made and accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and the value of it is leſſen'd exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, if it did not purchaſe faith, repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and holineſs, for them on whom they are beſtowed. — That <hi>free will</hi> which ſtands in competition with, and oppoſition to the grace of God in our ſalvation, can never without this be thrown to the ground as it ought to be. — The doctrine of <hi>effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious grace</hi> which does ſo much honour to the Holy Spirit; and the doctrine of the <hi>ſaints perſeverance in grace,</hi> which is ſo com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable to them; depend very much on this doctrine of <hi>election.</hi>— This is the <hi>foundation</hi> of all thoſe <hi>great and precious promiſes</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain'd in the new covenant; the <hi>ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>work</hi> of our redemption; the <hi>riſe</hi> and <hi>ſpring</hi> of all thoſe ſpiritual bleſſings we are made the partakers of, to which the ſaints ſhou'd look back in their joyful praiſes, and
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:004497_0125_100D59E14CD29BA8"/>without the conſideration of which, they cannot <hi>comprehend what is the height and depth, the length and breadth of the love of God in Chriſt</hi> It is therefore taken into that thanksgiving of the apoſtle, Eph. 1.3.4. <hi>Bleſſed be the God and Father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who hath bleſſed us with all ſpiritual bleſſings in heavenly things,</hi> ACCORDING AS HE HAS CHOSEN US IN HIM BEFORE THE FOUN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DATION OF THE WORLD.</p>
               <p>In a word; As this doctrine is a ſpring of <hi>conſolation</hi> to believers, ſo 'tis a moſt powerful argument to holineſs &amp; <hi>obedience;</hi> and this not only that they mayn't be without the tokens of election, but out of gratitude, and by way of acknowledgment to God for his diſtinguiſhing and eternal love to them. Accordingly it is matter of obſervation, that thoſe who have embrac'd this doctrine, have been among the moſt exemplary, cautious, diligent and fruitful chriſtians. But this has almoſt enter'd me into the</p>
               <p>VIth and laſt thing propoſ'd, namely, The <hi>improvement of the ſubject</hi> to the ends of ſerious religion, and practical godlineſs. For had I taken it to be only an abſtruſe ſpeculation, and not <hi>a doctrine according to godlineſs,</hi> I had ſpar'd my ſelf the pains of theſe diſcourſes.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="121" facs="unknown:004497_0126_100D59E2D2C60F90"/>
The ſubject may be improv'd,</p>
               <p n="1">1. To let us into the meaning of ſeveral of the acts of God's <hi>providence.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus we are from hence furniſh'd with a reaſon, why <hi>the human race was not caſt off by God, upon the apoſtacy,</hi> as were the angels that ſinned. It was becauſe there was an election of grace amongſt them. This gave birth to the early promiſe of the ſeed of the woman to break the ſerpents head. To this it was owing that there was an arreſt of judgment, after the ſentence was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounc'd on our apoſtate parents; and that mankind was allow'd to partake ſo largely of the divine goodneſs.</p>
               <p>We alſo learn from hence the reaſon of God's patience with the <hi>preſent world,</hi> that is grown ſo ſinful. It is becauſe of a diſtinguiſh'd remnant of mankind that are in it now, and are to be born into it here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after. So thoſe words are to be expounded, Iſa. 65.8, 9. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, as the new wine is found in the cluſter, and one ſaith, deſtroy it not, for a bleſſing is in it: ſo will I do for my ſervants ſake, that I may not deſtroy them all. And I will bring forth a ſeed out of</hi> Jacob, <hi>and out of</hi> Judah <hi>an inheritor of my mountains: and mine cloot ſhall inherit it, and my ſervants ſhall
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:004497_0127_100D59E500CA3988"/>dwell there.</hi> So our ſaviour ſaid that <hi>for the elects ſake,</hi> the days of the deſtruction of the <hi>Jews</hi> ſhou'd be ſhortned, and a ſtop put to that deſolation, which otherwiſe wou'd have proceeded to that degree, that no fleſh ſhould be ſaved, <hi>Mat</hi> 24.22. When the elect of God are all born into the world, and ripened for heaven, then judgment will commence, the patience of God with our ſinful ſpecies will be at an end, and that deſtruction by fire unto which the world is reſerv'd will come on.</p>
               <p>Again,</p>
               <p>Here's a reaſon of the divine forbearance and long ſuffering towards <hi>particular ſinners.</hi> If they are not among the elect themſelves, who are to be effectually called in due time, it may be ſome of the elect are to <hi>ſpring from them,</hi> and for this reaſon they are ſpar'd notwithſtanding all their provocations. If God ſhould make quick work, and <hi>early deſtroy</hi> all the wicked of the earth, whence ſhou'd his elect ariſe in the world? <hi>Jero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boam</hi> and <hi>Abrz</hi> were not cut off in their firſt tranſgreſſions, becauſe good <hi>Abijah</hi> and <hi>Hezekiah</hi> were to ſpring from them. Many that will heartily embrace Chriſt, muſt riſe from ſuch as reject him. The Lord ſuffers many a wicked perſon to ſtand for a time under his patience, ſays holy Mr. <hi>Flavell,</hi> becauſe children are to ſpring from them,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:004497_0128_100D59E71BD7EA18"/>who will obey and embrace that Chriſt whom their wicked parents rejected." The world then has no need to murmur at, and quarrel with this doctrine of election as they do. It is well for the reſt of the world that there is an election of grace out of it. Others fare the better for this: Since for the ſake of theſe the wicked world is ſpar'd from age to age, and the execution of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine juſtice towards particular ſinners de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>layed.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This doctrine affords much <hi>comfort</hi> and <hi>encouragement</hi> to ſerious and thoughtful minds, in times of great <hi>defection</hi> and <hi>cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>When there is a wide ſpread of error, and a mighty torrent of profaneneſs; when evil men and ſeducers wax worſe &amp; worſe, as they will do in the laſt days; when many are turned from the faith, and num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers looſe their firſt love; let the pious and faithful in Chriſt Jeſus remember for their encouragement, it is impoſſible to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the elect, in things that are eſſential to ſalvation; and <hi>the foundation of God ſtands ſure; having this ſeal, the Lord knoweth them that are his.</hi> And it may be the number of theſe is much larger than we are ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ready to ſear. As in <hi>Elijahs</hi> time, when the apoſtacy from the true worſhip
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:004497_0129_100D59E8A03F8610"/>and ſervice of God was ſo general, that the good prophet tho't there was no one beſide himſelf who preſerv'd his integrity, he was told for h s comfort, there were thouſands more. The apoſtle mentions this inſtance, and applies it to the times of the preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the goſpel, Rom. 11.2, 3, 4, 5. <hi>God hath not caſt away his people which he fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knew. Wot ye not what the ſcripture ſaith of</hi> Elias? <hi>how he maketh interceſſion to God againſt</hi> Iſrael, <hi>ſaying, Lord, they have killed thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, and digged down thine altars; and I am left alone, and they ſeek my life. But what ſaith the anſwer of God unto him? I have reſerved to my ſelf ſeven thouſand men, who have not bowed the knee to the image of</hi> Baal. <hi>Even ſo then, at this preſent time alſo, there is a remnant according to the election of grace.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">3. Since ſome of the children of men are choſen unto ſalvation, predeſtinated unto life, let us inquire, Whether we have, at preſent, any good ground to hope that we are of the diſtinguiſh'd number.</p>
               <p>This may be known, or the apoſtle would not have exhorted us to <hi>give dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence to make our election ſure;</hi> as he does in 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.10. And he writes to the <hi>Theſſalonians,</hi> as if their election, (or the election of the <hi>body</hi> of that church) was
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:004497_0130_100D59EC25DECF18"/>no longer a matter of doubt, but of cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty. The 1ſt ep. 1 ch. 4. v. <hi>Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>We need not here ſay in our hearts, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into heaven,</hi> to ſee whether my name is written there? <hi>Who will bring the book of life down to me,</hi> to ſee whether I am enroll'd in it, or not? The proof of this matter <hi>is near</hi> us, even in <hi>the book of ſcripture</hi> which we have in our hands.</p>
               <p>The apoſtle in the place juſt mentioned, tells the <hi>Theſſalonians</hi> what was the proof of their election. <hi>Knowing, brethren beloved, your election of God: For our goſpel came to you, not in word only, but in power, and in the Holy Ghoſt, and in much aſſurance.</hi> Inquire then, what effect the word of the goſpel has had upon you Has it come to you <hi>with power?</hi> Has it had a convincing, enlightning, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling, converting efficacy upon you? Have you found it as <hi>a fire,</hi> and as <hi>a hammer, that breaketh the rock in pieces?</hi> — Has it come to you in the <hi>Holy Ghoſt?</hi> accompanied with ſuch an energy of the ſpirit, as to kill ſin in you, and make you alive to God? for <hi>the letter killeth, but</hi> it is <hi>the ſpirit giveth life.</hi> — Has it come to you with <hi>much aſſurance?</hi> Are you ſo convinc'd of the truth of the goſpel, as to adhere to the profeſſion of it
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:004497_0131_100D59EDD515FEB8"/>againſt all the diſputings of men, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements of the world; and ſo as to venture your ſouls, your everlaſting con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns upon the verity of it? Do you eſteem the records of the goſpel to be <hi>faithful ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings,</hi> and <hi>worthy of all acceptation;</hi> and make the <hi>bible</hi> the rule of your life, the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of your hope, and ſpring of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation. This ſucceſs of the goſpel upon you will be a proof of your election, as it was of the election of the believing obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent <hi>Theſſalonians.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The apoſtle <hi>Peter</hi> alſo ſhews us in what way and order to make our election ſure. As in the place we have juſt mentioned, (2 Pet. 1.10.) <hi>Give diligence, bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, to make your calling and election ſure;</hi> your election by your <hi>calling:</hi> For, <hi>whom he predeſtinated, them he alſo called.</hi> If then God has added the internal to the external call of the goſpel. If you are bro't out of thoſe ſinful ways you once walk'd in, to walk in <hi>the way of good men,</hi> the way of ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and obedience; If you are taken off from the world, and no longer ſeek it as your bleſſedneſs, but have choſen God for your portion &amp; happineſs; if heaven is your end, and you are reſolv'd to take up with nothing ſhort of it, and make uſe of Chriſt as the way to it; you may then be aſſur'd, you ſhall ſee <hi>the good of his choſen, and rejoice with the gladneſs of his nation, and glory with his inheritance.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="unknown:004497_0132_100D59EF7185F698"/>
Again,</p>
               <p>We are told, Acts 13.48. <hi>As many as were ordained unto eternal life, believed.</hi> Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine then, whether <hi>the faith of God's elect</hi> is wro't in you. Do you believe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord God has given of his ſon? God's way of ſaving ſinners by Jeſus Chriſt, reveal'd and propos'd in the goſpel, do you receive it, approve of, and reſt in it; and renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing all other hopes and expectations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe your whole confidence therein? And is Chriſt precious to you, as he is <hi>to them that believe?</hi> You may know then you were ordain'd to eternal life before the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the world.</p>
               <p>To proceed,</p>
               <p>Your <hi>love to God,</hi> as well as your faith in Chriſt, evidences your election: for ſo we read, 1 John 4.19. <hi>We love him, becauſe be firſt loved us.</hi> Let it then be inquir'd, Do I <hi>love the Lord our God with all the heart, and ſoul, and mind, and ſtrongth?</hi> Do I make choice of him before all other things, and delight in him ſupreamly? Is this the inward lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of my ſoul, <hi>Thou art my portion, O Lord. Whom have I in heaven but thee? and there is nothing on earth I deſire beſides thee.</hi> You may then hear him ſaying to you, <hi>Yea I have loved you with an everlaſting love.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="128" facs="unknown:004497_0133_100D59F11A385B48"/>
But as love can't be ſincere unleſs it is obediential, ſo our <hi>new obedience</hi> is another proof and evidence of our election. The apoſtle has told us, Eph. 1.3. <hi>He hath choſen us before the foundation of the world, that we ſhou'd be holy, and without blame before him in love.</hi> We muſt inquire then, if we wou'd know our election, Whether there is a ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration wro't between us and our ſins and luſts? Whether we walk <hi>not after the fleſh, but after the ſpirit?</hi> Whether indwelling ſin is a burthen and grief to us, and we are labouring in the mortification of it? Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther we are in the uſe of all proper and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed means, <hi>Cleanſing our ſelves from all filthyneſs of fleſh and ſpirit; perfecting holineſs in the fear of God?</hi> Do we deſire nothing more than holineſs, a conformity to the image of Chriſt? And do we lament no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than our want of holineſs, or of conformity to the image of his ſon? This is <hi>a token of ſalvation.</hi> You may reſt ſatisfied from hence, that God <hi>has not appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed you to wrath, but to obtain ſalvation by our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. The next uſe muſt be by way of counſel, to ſuch as have no ground <hi>at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent</hi> to conclude themſelves of this number; who have no reaſon <hi>as yet</hi> to think them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves effectually called and converted; to have that faith, and love, and holineſs,
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:004497_0134_100D59F5894E9D38"/>which are the marks of God's elect. To ſuch I wou'd addreſs a few words of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection; and O that they might be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and put in practice!</p>
               <p n="1">1. Don't <hi>murmur</hi> at God's decree of election; for this is to rebell againſt God, and will highly diſpleaſe him. And beſides, you have no reaſon to do ſo; for this is not the <hi>cauſe</hi> of your continuing in ſin and impenitence, as was ſhown when we an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer'd the objections againſt this doctrine; but it muſt be aſſign'd to the corruption and wickedneſs of your nature, from which indeed you can't be deliver'd but by the almighty grace of God. Labour to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concil'd to God's method of ſaving ſinners, tho' it be not ſuch as human reaſon might have carv'd out. His method of ſalvation is certainly the wiſeſt and the beſt: For as the heavens <hi>are high above the earth; ſo are his tho'ts above our tho'ts, and his ways above our ways,</hi> Iſa. 55.8.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Beware of drawing up any <hi>dark concluſions</hi> concerning your ſelf, as if the decree of God was againſt you. Satan may tempt you to this; but <hi>you are not ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant of his devices.</hi> Remember, tho' there are many ſigns of election, there are no certain tokens of reprobation, except the ſin againſt
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:004497_0135_100D59F71470A2B0"/>the Holy Ghoſt. Suppoſing the doctrine of election, yet, as God has a reconciling work on foot in this world, you are as likely to have an intereſt in it as another. It is certain God has a purpoſe of mercy for a great many. Some in all ages ſhall find mercy. And there is nothing to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude <hi>thee,</hi> in thy country, ſex, age, or any of thy outward circumſtances; no, nor yet in the greatneſs of thy ſins, or long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in them. For <hi>it is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, even the chief of them.</hi> Wherefore your way is,</p>
               <p n="3">3. To <hi>apply for mercy,</hi> and <hi>hope for it,</hi> up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the invitations and encouragements of the goſpel. Even a <hi>peradventure</hi> is look'd upon to be encouragement eno' to try in other caſes of hazard and diſtreſs; and why not in this? Remember the inſtance of <hi>Benhadad's</hi> ſervants, and take direction from it, 1 Kings 20.31, 32. <hi>And his ſervants ſaid unto him, Behold now, we have heard that the kings of the houſe of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>are merciful kings: let us, I pray thee, put ſackcloth on our loins, and ropes upon our heads, and go out <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> the king of</hi> Iſrael; <hi>peradventure he will ſave thy life. So they girded ſackcloth on their loins, and put ropes on their heads, and came to the king of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſaid, Thy ſervant</hi> Benhadad
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:004497_0136_100D59F8A0B951C0"/>
                  <hi>ſaith, I pray thee, let me live.</hi> And the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion was not only accepted, and his life ſpared, but he was treated with marks of friendſhip and reſpect</p>
               <p>Go and do thus, O ſinner: ſubmit to mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, without indenting and making terms with God. You have much greater en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to ſubmit to the <hi>God of Heaven,</hi> than they had to the preſent <hi>king of</hi> Iſrael. There was but a bare peradventure in that caſe. They had heard only in the general that the kings of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were merciful kings; but whether this king <hi>Ahab</hi> was of ſuch a diſpoſition, they knew not; and yet they adventur'd upon it to ſeek to him But thou haſt heard that the king of heaven <hi>is</hi> a mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful king. He has proclaim'd his name, <hi>The Lord, the Lord God, gracious and merciful, long ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth.</hi> He has actually pardon'd thouſands and millions in the like condition; and his reconciling work is not yet at an end. A gracious mediator is provided to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce you into his preſence, and to make interceſſion for you: If you will not then apply and ſeek, ſurely you deſerve to periſh.</p>
               <p>O man, woman, whoever thou art, I muſt tell you before I leave you, Your election of God need not lie long at ſuch uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty with you. Yea, I may venture to
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:004497_0137_100D59FB5A7A7140"/>tell you, it may poſſibly be bro't to a happy concluſion at this very time, that you are of this number I muſt repeat thoſe words of our ſaviour, John 6.37. <hi>All that the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther giveth me, ſhall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Chriſt then is the fruit and evidence of election; and ſo this important matter may be decided by it. Now the call of Chriſt to you in the goſpel this day is; <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline your ear, and come unto me; bear and your ſoul ſhall live: and I will make an everlaſting covenant with you, even the ſure mercies of</hi> David. Come to me, O ſinner, for ſuch bleſſings as I have to beſtow on the people of God. Put your ſoul over into my hands, to be waſh'd in my blood, juſt fied by my righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, ſanctified by my ſpirit, and preſerv'd by my power. Let me henceforth be your prophet to teach and enlighten you, your prieſt to atone and interceed for you, and your king to rule you for my ſelf —. If any ſoul of you do now comply with this call: If you can make this anſwer, <hi>Lord, I am willing to come to thee, for theſe ends and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. Thou haſt made me willing. I conſent to be thine</hi> now <hi>if I never did before, and take thee for my ſaviour leader, owner, and ruler for ever</hi> — The matter is then at this time bro't to an iſſue. The ſecret decree of
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:004497_0138_100D59FE1B0BD7E8"/>election <hi>this day opens</hi> upon you. You may now know you were firſt given to Chriſt by the father, or you wou'd never have been inclined and enabled thus to come to him; and henceforth you may read your <hi>name written in the lamb's book of life.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. The laſt uſe may be to put thoſe who have any good <hi>ground to hope that they are of this number,</hi> upon ſome ſpecial duties agreeable to their ſtate and privileges.</p>
               <p n="1">1. You ſhou'd thankfully <hi>acknowledge and adore the riches of diſtinguiſhing grace,</hi> eminently illuſtrated in your election. The diſciple was ſo affected with the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing favour of heaven, to himſelf and others, as in a rapture to cry out, John 14.22. <hi>Lord, bow is it, that thou wilt manifeſt thy ſelf to us, and not unto the world!</hi> A be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever may ſay, How is it Lord, that thou ſhou'd chuſe <hi>me!</hi> That thou ſhou'd ſet thine everlaſting love upon <hi>me,</hi> when ſo many others, fallen men as well as fallen angels, are paſs'd by! And ſo many of the learned, rich, and honourable of the world! And this before I had any thing good in me; upon no fore-ſeen merit; nay, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding thou ſaweſt how I ſhou'd diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>honour and provoke thee by my ſins! O glorious, ſovereign, &amp; diſtinguiſhing grace!
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:004497_0139_100D59FFC6FD65F0"/>I can never eno' admire it! Eternity will not be too long to praiſe thee for it! — Peculiar favour calls for ſpecial thankful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. <hi>I thank thee, O father, Lord of heaven and earth, that thou haſt hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes: Even ſo, father, for ſo it ſeemeth good in thy ſight!</hi> Here, here, ſays one, are <q>thanksgivings of the moſt elevated ſtrain in chriſtianity They are words, to <hi>lift up the born.</hi> They ſound high in our devotions. A thankful Chriſtian rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his thanksgivings to the higheſt notes, when he comes hereabouts. 'Tis a melody peculiarly acceptable to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; 'tis the very beginning of heaven.</q>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Love him who has firſt loved you,</hi> in ſuch a manner as may ſomething anſwer his love to you. He lov'd you <hi>before you bad a being;</hi> and you ſhould love him <hi>while you have any being.</hi> He lov'd you <hi>above many others;</hi> &amp; you muſt love him <hi>above all creatures,</hi> more than <hi>houſes and lands, brother or ſiſter, father or mother, husband, wiſe, or children;</hi> or you are not worthy of him, or of that love which he has plac'd upon you.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Always remember you are under <hi>the higheſt obligations to holineſs and obedience.</hi> For <hi>ye are a choſen generation, a royal prieſthood, an holy nation, a peculiar people, that ye ſhou'd
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:004497_0140_100D5A015C1FD058"/>ſhew forth the praiſes of him, who has called you out of darkneſs, into his marvellous light.</hi> 
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Pet. 2.9.</note> 
                  <hi>Put on therefore as the elect of God, holy and beloved, bowels of mercy, kindneſs, humbleneſs of mind, meekneſs, long-ſuffering, forbearing one other, if any man have a quarrel againſt any; even as Chriſt forgave you, ſo alſo do ye.</hi>

               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Cheerfully <hi>acquieſce in all the dealings of God with you.</hi> For all his providences are the effect of his purpoſes, and are beſt ſuted to carry on his deſign of grace con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning you. <hi>We know,</hi> ſays the apoſtle, in the verſe before our text, <hi>That all things
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:004497_0141_100D5A054CEA6968"/>ſhall work together for good to them that love God, to them who are the called according to his purpoſe.</hi> You are <hi>predeſtinated,</hi> ſays our text, <hi>to be conformed to the image of his ſon;</hi> and your very afflictions and ſorrows are appointed to bring you to this confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to Chriſt, who was himſelf <hi>a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief.</hi> You may reſt ſatisfied, that nothing you meet with can hinder the purpoſe of God concerning you from taking effect, but rather all things ſhall be ſubſervient the reunto. Therefore you may not only take the comfort of your mercies, but get above your afflictions, and <hi>rejoice in tribulation.</hi> Read the believers ſecurity and triumph, in the verſes follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our text; <hi>Who ſhall lay any thing to the charge of God's elect? It is God that juſtifieth: Who is he that condemneth? It is Chriſt that died, yea rather, that is riſen again, who is even at the right band of God, who alſo maketh in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terceſſion for us. Who ſhall ſeparate us from the love of Chriſt? ſhall tribulation, or diſtreſs, or perſecution, or famine, or nakedneſs, or peril, or ſword? (As it is written, For thy ſake we are killed all the day long; we are accounted as ſheep for the ſlaughter) Nay in all theſe things we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us. For I am perſwaded, that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor powers, nor things preſent, nor things to come,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:004497_0142_100D5A06D0C993B0"/>nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature, ſhall be able to ſeparate us from the love of God which is in Chriſt Jeſus our Lord.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. Forget not to <hi>pray for all that belong to the election of grace</hi> For thoſe that are not yet gather'd. <hi>Other ſheep</hi> Chriſt <hi>has, which are</hi> not yet bro't into <hi>the fold;</hi> pray that theſe may <hi>hear his voice,</hi> and <hi>follow him.</hi> Some of the elect are not only <hi>uncalled,</hi> but <hi>unborn:</hi> It is therefore a ſutable petition in the publick liturgy of the <hi>church of England,</hi> which we can join in, <hi>That it may pleaſe God of his gracious goodneſs ſhortly to accompliſh the number of his elect"</hi>

6. Let the <hi>ſecond coming and appearing of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> be the matter of your earneſt <hi>prayer,</hi> and object of your joyful <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>expectation.</hi> For in this day the Lord will <hi>make up his jewels.</hi> Now Chriſt will raiſe up all that were given him by the father, without letting any be loſt or want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; ſaying to his father, <hi>Here I am, and the children which thou haſt given me.</hi> I preſent them all together, <hi>a glorious church, not having ſpot, or wrinkle, or any ſuch thing.</hi> This will be done <hi>with exceeding joy,</hi> both on the part of the Father who choſe them, the Son who redeem'd them, the Holy Spirit who ſanctified them, miniſters who were inſtrumental to gather them in, and on the part of the choſen and redeemed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.</p>
               <p>We have a pleaſant viſion of Chriſt at the head of a happy remnant, preſerv'd from the corruptions and carried thro' the perſecutions of <hi>antichriſt:</hi> Read it; and then think what a glorious ſight it will be to ſee him at the head of the whole church of the elect in the great day. Rev. 14.1, to 5. <hi>And I looked, and lo, a Lamb ſtood on the mount Sion, and with him an hundred forty and four thouſand, having his Fathers name written in their foreheads. And I heard a voice from heaven, as the voice of many waters, and as
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:004497_0144_100D5A0A5B12F820"/>the voice of a great thunder: and I heard the voice of harpers harping with their harps: And they ſung as it were a new ſong before the throne, and before the four beaſts, and the elders: and no man could learn that ſong, but the hundred and forty and four thouſand, which were redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med from the earth. Theſe are they which were not defiled with women; for they are virgins: theſe are they which follow the Lamb whither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever he goeth: theſe were redeemed from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong men, being the firſt fruits unto God, and the Lamb. And in their mouth was found no guile: for they are without fault before the throne of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus I have been carried thro' what I propos'd on this ſubject. Many things which belong to it have been omitted; and others but touch'd, which I could with pleaſure have enlarg'd upon: but I have ſtudied brevity.</p>
               <p>And now, I deſire to <hi>bow the knee in thanksgiving to the God and father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> who has given me this oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to bear a ſmall teſtimony to theſe important truths. I truſt I have had a ſingle aim at his glory in theſe diſcourſes; and ſo I look to Him, in his ſon JESUS, for his gracious acceptance of what has been his own, and his merciful forgiveneſs of
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:004497_0145_100D5A0EB8BF5800"/>what has been otherwiſe; and on him I humbly depend to ſucceed them.</p>
               <p>I cloſe all with the apoſtles prayer and benediction, in 2 Theſs. 2.16, 17. <hi>Now our</hi> LORD JESUS CHRIST <hi>himſelf, and</hi> GOD <hi>even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlaſting conſolation, and good hope through grace, Comfort your hearts, and ſtabliſh you in every good word and work.</hi>
