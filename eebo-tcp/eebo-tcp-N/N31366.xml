            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <hi>A</hi> PROTEST, Preſented to the HOUSE OF ASSEMBLY, By the Subſcribers, at the Cloſe of the late Debate there, concerning the ſending MR. FRANKLIN As an Aſſiſtant to our AGENT, at the Court of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">W</seg>E whoſe Names are hereunto ſubſcribed, do object and <hi>proteſt</hi> againſt the Appointment of the Perſon propoſed as an Agent of this Province, for the following reaſons.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt.</hi> Becauſe we believe him to be the Chief Author of the Meaſures purſued by the late Aſſembly, which have occaſioned ſuch Uneaſineſs and Deſtraction among the good People of this Province.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly.</hi> Becauſe we believe his fixed enmity to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors will preclude all Accommodations of our Diſputes with them, even on juſt and reaſonable Terms;—So that for theſe two Reaſons, we are filled with the moſt affecting Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions, that the Petitions lately tranſmitted to England, will be made uſe of to produce a Change of Government, contrary to the Intention of the Petitioners; the greateſt part of whom, we are perſuaded, only deſigned thereby to obtain a Compliance with ſome equitable Demands.—And thus, by ſuch an Appointment, we, and a vaſt Number of our moſt worthy Conſtituents, are deprived of all hopes of ever ſeeing an End put to the fatal Diſſentions of our Country; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our firm Opinion, that any further Proſecution of the Meaſures for a Change of Government at this Time, will lay the Foundations of unceaſing Feuds, and all the Miſeries of Confuſion, among the People we repreſent, and their Poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity.—This ſtep gives us the more lively Affliction, as it is taken at the very Moment, when we are informed by a Member of this Houſe, that the Governor has aſſured him of his having received Inſtructions from the Proprietors, on their hearing of our late Diſpute, to give his Aſſent to the Taxati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their Eſtates in the ſame manner that the Eſtates of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Perſons are to be taxed, and alſo to confirm, for the Public uſe, the ſeveral <hi>Squares,</hi> formerly claimed by the City; On which Subjects, we make no doubt, the Governor would have ſent a Meſſage to the Houſe, if this had been the uſual Time of doing Buſineſs, and he had not been neceſſarily ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to meet the Aſſembly of the lower Counties.—And therefore we cannot but anxiouſly regret that, at a Time when the Proprietors have ſhewn ſuch a Diſpoſition, this Houſe ſhould not endeavour to cultivate the ſame, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain from them every reaſonable Demand that can be made on the part of the People, in vigorouſly inſiſting on which, we would moſt earneſtly unite with the reſt of the Houſe.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly.</hi> Becauſe the Gentleman propoſed, we are informed, is very unfavourably thought of by ſeveral of his Majeſty's Miniſters; and we are humbly of Opinion, that it will be diſreſpectful to our moſt Gracious Sovereign, and diſadvan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tageous to ourſelves and our conſtituents, to employ ſuch a Perſon as an Agent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly.</hi> Becauſe the Propoſal of the Perſon mentioned, is ſo extremely diſagreeable to a very great Number of the moſt ſerious and reputable inhabitants of this Province of all Denominations and Societies (one Proof of which is, his ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving been rejected, both by this City and County at the laſt Election, though he had repreſented the former in Aſſembly for 14 Years that we are convinced no Meaſure this Houſe can adopt, will tend ſo much to inflame the Reſentments and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitter the Diviſions of the good People of this Province, as his appointment to be our Agent—And we cannot but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely lament, that the Peace and Happineſs of Pennſylvania ſhould be ſacrificed for the Promotion of a Man, who cannot be advanced but by the Convulſions of his Country.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fifthly.</hi> Becauſe the unneceſſary haſte with which this Houſe has acted in proceeding to this Appointment (without making a ſmall Adjournment, tho' requeſted by many Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, to conſult our Conſtituents on the Matters to be decided, and) even before their Speaker has been preſented to the King's Repreſentative, tho' we are informed that the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor will be in Town the Beginning of next Week;—may ſubject us to the Cenſures and very heavy Diſpleaſure of our moſt gracious Sovereign and his Miniſters.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sixthly.</hi> Becauſe the Gentleman propos'd, has heretofore ventured, contrary to an Act of Aſſembly, to place the <note n="*" place="bottom">The Money here meant was a Sum granted by Parliament as an Indemnification for part of our Expences in the late War, which by Act of Aſſembly was ordered for its better Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to be placed in the Bank.</note> pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic Money in the Stocks, whereby this Province ſuffered a loſs of £.6000; and that Sum, added to £.5000 granted for his Expences, makes the whole Coſt of his former Voyage to England, amount to ELEVEN THOUSAND POUNDS; which expenſive kind of Agency we do not chuſe to imitate, and burden the Public with unneceſſary loads of Debt. For theſe and other Reaſons we ſhould think ourſelves guilty of betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Rights of Pennſylvania, if we ſhould preſumptuouſly commit them to the Diſcretion of a Man, againſt whom ſo many and juſt Objections preſent themſelves.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Laſtly.</hi> We being extremely deſirous to avert the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefs apprehended from the intended Appointment, and as much as in us lies to promote Peace and Unanimity among us and our Conſtituents, do humbly propoſe to the Houſe, that if they will agree regularly to appoint any <note n="§" place="bottom">Dr. Fothergill was mentioned by the Subſcribers as a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Perſon.</note> Gentlemen of Integrity, Abilities, and Knowledge in England, to aſſiſt Mr. Jackſon as our Agent, under a Reſtriction not to preſent the Petitions for a Change of our Government, or any of them, to the King or his Miniſters, unleſs an expreſs Order for that Purpoſe be hereafter given by the Aſſembly of this Province; we will not give it any Oppoſition: But if ſuch an Appointment ſhould be made, we muſt inſiſt (as we cannot think it a neceſſary one) that our Conſtituents, already la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring under heavy Debts, be not burthened with freſh Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions on that Account; and therefore, in Condeſcenſion to the Members, who think another Agent neceſſary, we will concur with them, if they approve of this Propoſal, in pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch Agent at our own Expence.</p>
