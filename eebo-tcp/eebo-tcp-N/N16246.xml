            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>To the PUBLIC.</head>
            <p>THE author conſents to the following publication, by the requeſt of many worthy citizens, which he cannot, with propriety, refuſe. He doth not expect any particular advantage or applauſe thereby, but will be fully ſatisfied, if, by his endeavours, any new lights may be reflected upon the ſubjects contained therein. And indeed the novelty as well as importance of the trials, in which every individual was intereſted, might of themſelves excuſe his preſumption.</p>
            <p>WHY ſhould I mention <hi>preſumption,</hi> when it is well known, that in this <hi>free</hi> country every one has a right to ſcribble, if he pleaſes, and no one can be injured, becauſe no one is obliged to read. Reading however is the paſſion of many, as writing is that of ſome: If there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the reader ſhould find himſelf diſguſted, he may derive one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that of fixing in his mind the retention of more <hi>uſeful</hi> reading.</p>
            <p>IT may be objected, that writing and publiſhing, without affording inſtruction or pleaſure, are detrimental to the Republic, as much time may have been conſumed thereby, which ought to have been occupied for valuable purpoſes. Without denying the charge, let thoſe who have directly or indirectly contributed to the late political meaſures reflect how <hi>their</hi> time has been employed, in fabricating a ſyſtem of revenue and finance, ſubverſive of private contracts, and public faith!— Perhaps a view of contraſted blunder and abſurdity may produce ſome good, when the force of argument would be exerted in vain.</p>
            <p>BUT why ſhould the author impoſe upon the reader a recital of his <hi>own</hi> tedious, indigeſted pleas?—Why did he not content himſelf with a ſimple relation of facts, and an enumeration of the principal arguments and authorities?—Becauſe he is indolent, and found it leſs troubleſome to himſelf to write from recollection, than to form a
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:020825_0003_0FB0F8CB6EC7C4E0"/>
new arrangement and detail of the ſubject. Beſides, the orators of Greece and Rome exhibited to the public, in the ſame way, their pleadings upon the moſt weighty occaſions. And although the author hath not the vanity to compare himſelf to any the leaſt of thoſe ora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, yet he feels a pleaſure in <hi>attempting</hi> to imitate them, and to revive that part of ancient learning.</p>
            <p>LET it be ſubmitted to the candid, whether the frequent publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of pleadings at the bar, upon cauſes of importance, would not have a ſalutary tendency to reform the preſent manner, ſo replete with inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacies, abſurdities, and (to the ſhame of ſome practitioners) ſcurrility itſelf?—</p>
            <p>IT is cuſtomary, in ſome countries, for the ladies to attend upon the trial of popular cauſes. What an excellent practice, and how admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly calculated to produce elegance of ſentiment, delicacy of expreſſion, and a polite addreſs!—It is true, the preſence of the fair ſex may excite diffidence in the young practitioner; but how amiable is diffidence, how charming is modeſty, in oppoſition to thoſe ridiculous airs, which give to impudence an appearance of knowledge, and to pertneſs of ſpeech the reſemblance of elocution!—</p>
            <p>WHETHER the preceding obſervations bear any relation to the matters contained in the following ſheets, is of very little conſequence. For cuſtom only renders any thing of the kind expedient.—To cuſtom we ſubmit, as a matter of courſe; but to riſe above this foible, perhaps cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom ſhould be treated in her own way.</p>

            <pb facs="unknown:020825_0004_0FB0F8CF2C048E00"/>
            <p>UPON the laſt Monday of September, in the eleventh year of the Independence of the United States, in the city of Newport, and State of Rhode-Iſland, &amp;c. was heard, before the Superior Court of Judicature, Court of Aſſize, and General Gaol-Delivery, a certain information, John Trevett againſt John Weeden, for refuſing to receive the paper bills of this State, in payment for meat ſold in market, equivalent to ſilver or gold: And upon the day following the Court delivered the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous opinion of the Judges, that the information was not cog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nizable before them.</p>
            <p>THAT this important deciſion may be fully comprehended, it will be neceſſary to recur to the acts of the General Aſſembly, which ſuperinduced the trial.—At the laſt May ſeſſion, an act was made for emitting the ſum of one hundred thouſand pounds, lawful money, in bills, upon land ſecurity, which ſhould paſs in all kinds of buſineſs, and payments of former contracts, upon par with ſilver and gold, eſtimating an ounce of coined ſilver at ſix ſhillings and eightpence. Another act was paſſed in the June following, ſubjecting every perſon who ſhould refuſe the bills in payment for articles offered for ſale, or ſhould make a diſtinction in value between them and ſilver and gold, or who ſhould in any manner attempt to depreciate them, to a penal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of one hundred pounds, lawful money; one moiety to the State, and the other moiety to the informer; to be recovered before either of the Courts of General Seſſions of the Peace, of the Superior Court of Judicature, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>EXPERIENCE ſoon evinced the inadequacy of this meaſure to the objects of the Adminiſtration: And at a ſeſſion of the General Aſſembly, ſpecially convened by his Excellency the Governor, upon the third Monday of the following Auguſt, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther act was paſſed, in addition to and amendment of that laſt mentioned, wherein it is provided, that the fine of one hundred pounds be varied; and that for the future the fine ſhould not be
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:020825_0005_0FB0F8D005D45710"/>
leſs than ſix, nor exceed thirty pounds, for the firſt offence: The mode of proſecution and trial was alſo changed, agreeably to the following clauſes, "that the complainant ſhall apply to either of the Judges of the Superior Court of Judicature, &amp;c. within this State, or to either of the Judges of the Inferior Court of Common Pleas within the county where ſuch offence ſhall be committed, and lodge his certain information, which ſhall be iſſued by the Judge in the following form," &amp;c. It is then provided, that the perſon complained of come before a Court to be ſpecially convened by the Judge, in three days; "that the ſaid Court, when ſo convened, ſhall proceed to the trial of ſaid offender, and they are hereby authorized ſo to do, without any jury, by a majority of the Judges preſent, according to the laws of the land, and to make adjudication and determination, and that three members be ſufficient to conſtitute a Court, and that the judgment of the Court, if againſt the offender ſo complained of, be forthwith complied with, or that he ſtand committed to the county gaol, where the ſaid Court may be ſitting, till ſentence be performed, and that the ſaid judgment of ſaid Court ſhall be final and concluſive, and from which there ſhall be no appeal; and in ſaid proceſs no eſſoin, protection, privilege or injunction, ſhall be in anywiſe prayed, granted or allowed."</p>
            <p>IN conſequence of a ſuppoſed violation of this act, John Tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vett exhibited his complaint to the Hon. Paul Mumford, <abbr>Eſq</abbr> Chief Juſtice of the Superior Court, at his chamber, who cauſed a Special Court to be convened: But as the information was given during the term of the Court, it was referred into the term for conſideration and final determination.</p>
            <p>JOHN WEEDEN, being demanded and preſent in Court, made the following anſwer: "That it appears by the act of the General Aſſembly, whereon ſaid information is founded, that the ſaid act hath expired, and hath no force: Alſo, for that by the ſaid act the matters of complaint are made triable before Special Courts, incontroulable by the Supreme Judiciary Court of the State: And alſo for that the Court is not, by ſaid act, authorized and
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:020825_0006_0FB0F8D1740EA130"/>
empowered to impannel a jury to try the facts charged in the information; and ſo the ſame is unconſtitutional and void."</p>
            <p>THIS anſwer was enforced, by the author of theſe ſtrictures, nearly in the following words:</p>
            <p>I DO not appear, may it pleaſe the Honourable Court, upon the preſent occaſion, ſo much in the line of my profeſſion, as in the character of a citizen, deeply intereſted in the conſtitutional laws of a free, ſovereign, independent State. And, indeed, whenever the rights of all the citizens appear to be eſſentially connected with a controverted queſtion, conſcious of the dignity of man, we exerciſe our legal talents only as means conducive to the great end of political ſociety, general happineſs. In this arduous, though pleaſing purſuit, ſhould my efforts appear too feeble to ſupport the attempt, I ſhall derive a conſolation in reflecting, that the learned and honourable gentleman at my right is with me in the defence.</p>
            <p>WELL may a profound ſilence mark the attention of this numerous and reſpectable aſſembly! Well may anxiety be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played in every countenance! Well may the dignity of the Bench condeſcend to our ſolicitude for a moſt candid and ſerious attention, ſeeing that from the firſt ſettlement of this country un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the preſent moment, a queſtion of ſuch magnitude as that upon which the judgment of the Court is now prayed, hath not been judicially agitated!</p>
            <p>HAPPY am I, may it pleaſe your Honours, in making my warmeſt acknowledgments to the Court, for permitting the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation and the plea to be conſidered by them in their ſupreme judiciary capacity!—By this indulgent conceſſion, we feel our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at liberty to animadvert freely upon the illegality of the new-fangled juriſdictions erected by the General Aſſembly in the act more immediately in contemplation. The embarraſſments naturally accompanying a plea to the juriſdiction, by removing the cauſe from the Special Court into this Court, are totally removed; and, with them, the painful neceſſity of conſidering
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:020825_0007_0FB0F8D2F59D24B8"/>
your Honours as individually compoſing ſo dangerous a tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. The idea of that neceſſity is truly alarming, and we cannot do juſtice to our own feelings, without expreſſing a fervent wiſh that it may hereafter be ever baniſhed from the human breaſt!</p>
            <p>IN diſcuſſing the ſeveral points ſtated in the plea, we muſt neceſſarily call in queſtion the validity of the legiſlative act upon which the information is grounded. We ſhall attempt moſt clearly to evince, that it is contrary to the fundamental laws of the State, and therefore, as the civilians expreſs it, a mere nulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and void, <hi>ab initio.</hi> We ſhall treat, with decent firmneſs, upon the nature, limits and extent, of the legiſlative powers; and deduce, from a variety of obſervations and authorities, that the Legiſlature may err, do err; and that this act, if we confine ourſelves to the ſubject matter of it, can only be conſidered as an act of uſurpation; but having been enacted by Legiſlators of whoſe integrity and virtue we have the cleareſt conviction, and of whoſe good intentions we have not a doubt, it will be viewed as an haſty reſolution, inconſiderately adopted, and ſubject to legal reprehenſion.</p>
            <p>THE parties named in the proceſs are of no farther conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, than as the one repreſents the almoſt forlorn hopes of an hitherto diſappointed circle; the other as a victim; the firſt deſtined to the fury of their intemperate zeal and politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal phrenzy. Why ſhould the abettors of this ſalutary act, as many are pleaſed to call it, retire behind the curtain, in the day of trial, unleſs ſomething within them declares that all is not right? Or, dare they not appear in the character of informers? Why ſhould their artillery be levelled againſt an unfortunate man, who, not three weeks ſince, was an object of charity in the ſtreets of Newport; and now, "<note n="*" place="bottom">Young.</note> poor penſioner upon the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of an hour," is called upon to anſwer, criminally, for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſing beef at fourpence the pound, when it coſt him ſixpence upon the hoof, although purchaſed of ſome of the moſt influential promoters of the preſent meaſures?—Were they dubious of the event, or did they feel a reluctance in attacking gentlemen
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:020825_0008_0FB0F8D487691840"/>
of buſineſs, character and fortune, who daily and openly tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple upon this favourite idol?—Were they not acquainted with a Gibbs, and are they not intimately connected with a Cooke?—</p>
            <p>INCOMPARABLE was the ſentiment of a fine writer, "<note n="*" place="bottom">Monteſquieu.</note> that in a democratical government, the cuſtoms and manners controul the laws:" And whenever an attempt is made to force upon the people a ſyſtem repugnant to their principles, and at which every ſentiment of integrity muſt reluct, the authors themſelves, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſanguine in their hopes, will ever betray an inſtability in the execution, that generally forebodes diſappointment and chagrin. To your Honours, however, it is ſubmitted to determine, how far the obſervation will apply to the cauſe on trial. The peace, the honour, the ſafety of the State, depend upon, and the fate of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born millions may be affected by it.</p>
            <p>THE firſt point to which we ſolicit the attention of the Hon. Court is, that the act of the Legiſlature, upon which the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is founded, hath expired.</p>
            <p>IN the preamble to this act it is ſtated, "that the uſual and ſtated methods and times of holding Courts within this State are impracticable, inexpedient, and inapplicable to the true intent and meaning of the ſaid act (the act inflicting the hundred pounds penalty) and altogether inſufficient to carry into effect the good purpoſes of this Legiſlature, touching the ſame."</p>
            <p>THEN follows: "Be it enacted, that the mode of procedure, and the method of law proceſs, againſt any perſon or perſons who ſhall be guilty of a breach of the <hi>aforeſaid</hi> act, &amp;c. ſhall be as followeth." Hence, it is evident, that the principal aim in this act, is ſo to modify and vary the proceſs, as to enforce the ſanctions of the former; leſſening, however, the fine, to render proſecutions more familiar and practicable. Examine the act with the moſt critical exactneſs; there is not a clauſe in it which creates a crime, or defines or qualifies an action, ſo as to infer the idea of criminality. Obſerve therefore a ſubſequent clauſe, which
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:020825_0009_0FB0F8D60C1619D8"/>
enacts, "that the legal mode of carrying the <hi>afore-recited</hi> act into execution ſhall be in force fully and completely, for every purpoſe therein mentioned and contained, until all offences againſt which have been committed and complained of, and which may be committed and complained of, until the expiration of ten days after the riſing of this Aſſembly, may be fully heard, tried and determined; any thing in this act to the contrary in anywiſe notwithſtanding." What then hath become of the <hi>legal mode,</hi> pointed out in the act, ſince the expiration of the <hi>ten days</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in mentioned? What other legal mode, than that in queſtion, is taken notice of? That is the only antecedent to the limiting clauſe; at leaſt, it is the laſt antecedent; and ſo grammatically, as well as legally, is intended to continue in force the ſaid ſpace of <hi>ten days.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>"THE legal mode" "ſhall be in force" "until the expiration of ten days;" conſequently, at the expiration of ten days there was an end of it.</p>
            <p>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Blac. Com. 88.</note>FOR penal ſtatutes are to be conſtrued ſtrictly; not only with regard to the crime and the penalty, but alſo with reſpect to the proceſs; more eſpecially when the manner of trial is repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the common law.</p>
            <p>I AM ſenſible that ſtatutes, made <hi>pro publico bono</hi> (not <hi>malo,</hi> as in the preſent inſtance) claim a liberal conſtruction. Of that kind may be deemed, in legal contemplation, the emitting act, whereby it may be ſuppoſed that the means of commerce and other buſineſs are enlarged: But this act and the former penal act becoming one, are altogether penal. They are not directed to the public good; nor are they ſo formed, as to be entitled to liberal conſtruction.</p>
            <p>SHOULD it be objected, that this conſtruction would manifeſtly oppoſe and fruſtrate the general intent of the Legiſlature; I anſwer, the Courts of law will endeavour to eſtabliſh the actual meaning of the Legiſlature, if not oppoſed by a plain, legal con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction:
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:020825_0010_0FB0F8D81EBEA6B8"/>
But as they are ſworn to judge according to law, they cannot depart from this rule of deciſion.</p>
            <p>BUT, may it pleaſe your Honours, we do not place our prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal reliance upon this objection, although in legal propriety we might ſafely meet the conſequences. The whole frame of the act is ſo replete with blunders, contradictions and abſurdities, that not a trace of law-learning can be diſcovered in it. And to the honour of thoſe of the profeſſional gentlemen, who prefer the good of their country to the paltry gains of buſineſs, they had not any thing to do with it; nor any one elſe who under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood, or, if he underſtood, duly conſidered what he was about.</p>
            <p>WE now proceed to the ſecond point ſtated in the plea, "that by the act of the Legiſlature ſpecial trials are inſtituted, incontroulable by the Supreme Judiciary Court of the State."</p>
            <p>THERE are, in all free governments, three diſtinct ſources of power, the legiſlative, the judiciary and executive. The judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary power is more or leſs perfect, as the formation of the Courts of law tends to produce certainty and uniformity in legal deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minations. And indeed without certainty and uniformity in the judicial tribunals, the beſt poſſible ſyſtem of laws will prove en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely inadequate to the ſecurity of the people. For law itſelf is but a rule of action; and conſequently its very exiſtence is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed, when contradictory deciſions are admitted upon the ſame point. From hence may clearly be inferred the neceſſity of a Supreme Judiciary Court, to whoſe judgments, as the only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive evidence in law queſtions, all ſubordinate juriſdictions muſt conform. Such is the Court before which I now have the honour of appearing. Into the nature and extent of whoſe juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction permit me, with humble deference, to enquire.</p>
            <p>IN the charter, granted by King Charles the Second, it is granted, to the Governor and Company, when convened in their legiſlative capacity, "to appoint, order and direct, erect and ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle, ſuch places and Courts of Juriſdiction, for the hearing and determining of all actions, matters and things, within the ſaid
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:020825_0011_0FB0F8D93426D480"/>
Colony and Plantation, and which ſhall be in diſpute, and depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing there, as they ſhall think fit; and alſo to diſtinguiſh and ſet forth the ſeveral names and titles, duties, powers and limits, of each Court, office and officer, ſuperior and inferior." In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence whereof, the General Aſſembly, in the year 1729, eſtabliſhed this Court in its preſent form "<note n="‡" place="bottom">State laws, 51.</note> a Superior Court of Judicature, Court of Aſſize, and General Gaol-Delivery, over the whole Colony, for the regular hearing and trying all pleas, real, perſonal and mixed, and all pleas of the Crown." That they ſhall have "the ſame power and authority, in all matters and things in this Colony, as the Court of Common Pleas, King's Bench, or Exchequer, have, or ought to have, in that part of Great-Britain heretofore called England, and be empowered to give judgment in all matters and things before them cognizable, and to award execution thereon."</p>
            <p>THIS eſtabliſhment hath never been varied, nor the juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Court diminiſhed. The powers annexed to it were derived from the charter, from our original conſtitution; and by an uninterrupted exerciſe have become matters of common right. In point of antiquity, we find them exiſting, in full vigour, in the earlieſt periods of which we have any regular traces of the Engliſh conſtitution. It is unneceſſary however to look any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther back than to the Norman reigns, when juſtice was exerciſed in one Court, called the "<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Hawk. P. C. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

And after the erection of theſe Courts, the Supreme Court ſeems by degrees to have obtained the name of the Court of King's Bench, and hath always retained a ſupreme juriſdiction in all criminal matters."</p>
            <p>THE extent of theſe powers is well defined by the author laſt referred to, as well as by moſt of the writers upon the ſubject. "<note n="†" place="bottom">2 Hawk. P. C. 8.</note> There is no doubt but that this Court, being the higheſt Court
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020825_0012_0FB0F8DBC196FB80"/>
of common law, hath not only power to reverſe erroneous judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, given by Inferior Courts, but alſo to puniſh all inferior Magiſtrates, and all officers of juſtice, for all wilful and corrupt abuſes of their authority."</p>
            <p>IT commands, prohibits and reſtrains, all inferior juriſdictions, whenever they attempt to exceed their authority, or refuſe to exerciſe it for the public good, or upon the application of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals. There are many inſtances, I muſt confeſs, in which no appeal is allowed from other Courts to this Court; and in ſuch caſes it will not interpoſe its ſupreme controul, unleſs the other Courts exceed their authority, or otherwiſe, as before men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned.</p>
            <p>LET us illuſtrate the ſubject by reflecting, for a moment, upon the eſtabliſhment of our Courts of General Seſſions of the Peace. They are five in number, correſponding to the five counties of the State. They have cognizance of all crimes not capital, ariſing within their reſpective diſtricts, and their juriſdictions are perfectly equal. Suppoſe them exerciſing their legal judgments upon the ſame law; and that this law is of a complicated nature, admitting of different conſtructions, both in the definition of the crime, and the mode of puniſhment: May we not, muſt we not, conclude, that the ſame law would have different operations in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent counties?—Hence ariſes the neceſſity of a ſupreme controul, of a common ſtandard, to which the opinions of theſe five Judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>catories ſhall be conformable. The citizens are entitled not only to liberty, ariſing from the ſecurity which the laws afford, but they are equally entitled, and entitled to equal liberty. They muſt, therefore, they will apply to one tribunal, as to a focal point, where the knowledge of the law is concentered, and from whence its voice will be heard with irreſiſtible conviction, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the principles of univerſal equality.</p>
            <p>HAD the cognizance of informations been confined to the Courts of Seſſions only, the evil might have been remedied, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out appeal, by writs of Certiorari, Prohibition, Mandamus and Procedendo; but by an unheard of arrangement in the ſpecial
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:020825_0013_0FB0F8DD73DD8AC8"/>
juriſdictions, the Judges of this Court are preciſely upon a level with thoſe of the Seſſions. Their juriſdiction is concurrent, cumulative and equal. Conſequently there would not be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in applying to this Court, in their ſupreme judicial capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, to correct the errors and reſtrain the exceſſes that might ariſe from oppreſſive determinations. For in the ſecond, they might counteract their firſt deliberations, or refuſe to grant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs: But by their firſt deciſions, as a Special Court, a legal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice would naturally be formed in the minds of the Judges individually, which might totally obſtruct the avenues to juſtice. The pride of opinion is more or leſs prevalent in all men, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever exalted their ſtations; and however conformably the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion may be to the principles of rectitude, the judgment will be biaſſed by pre-exiſting opinions.</p>
            <p>MAKING every poſſible conceſſion for the ſake of the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the Supreme Judiciary Court could only correct the errors of its own Judges, determining in the Special Court; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the extravagancies that might accompany the proceedings of the other five Courts, could not, in any poſſible caſe, be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May it pleaſe your Honours,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AS all the glory of the ſolar ſyſtem is reflected from yonder refulgent luminary, ſo the irradiations of the inferior juriſdic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are derived from the reſplendent controul of this <hi>primum mobile</hi> in the civil adminiſtration. Under its genial influence, therefore, we beg liberty to conſider the laſt point ſubmitted to the judgment of the Court, "that by the act of the Legiſlature the Court is not authorized or empowered to impannel a jury for trying the facts complained of in the information."</p>
            <p>THE propoſition cannot be controverted: The expreſſions in the act, "that the majority of the Judges preſent ſhall proceed to hear, &amp;c. without any jury," do not require a comment.</p>
            <p>SHOULD it be objected that this clauſe of the act only empowers the Judges to try the fact, when the parties will agree to wave
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:020825_0014_0FB0F8DF24B30CD0"/>
the trial by jury, it will be ſufficient to anſwer, that the General Aſſembly intended directly the contrary. It is well known by all preſent, that on one day this clauſe was rejected, but on the day following (in conſequence of a nocturnal <hi>imperium in imperio,</hi> or convention of part of the members) a motion was made for receding, and they did recede accordingly. The general tenor of the act was ſo repugnant to the honeſt feelings of the people, when excited by ſober reflection, that the junto out of doors, and poſſibly ſome leading men within, were apprehenſive that convictions would not take place in the uſual mode of trial. They aimed therefore at a ſummary proceſs, flattering them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves that the Judges, being elected by the Legiſlators, would blindly ſubmit to their ſovereign will and pleaſure. But, happy for the State, our Courts in general are not intimidated by the dread, nor influenced by the debauch of power!—</p>
            <p>THIS part of the ſubject, and which is by far the moſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, will require a more ample diſcuſſion than the preceding. I muſt therefore beg the attention of the Honourable Court to the following conſiderations: That the trial by jury is a fundament<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al right, a part of our legal conſtitution: That the Legiſlature cannot deprive the citizens of this right: And that your Honours can, and we truſt will, ſo determine.</p>
            <p>"<note n="†" place="bottom">1 Blac.

After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, by the ſtatute called <hi>Confirmatio Cartarum,</hi> whereby the Great Charter is directed to be allowed as the common law, all judgments contrary to it are declared void; copies of it are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be ſent to all cathedral churches, and read twice a year to the people; and ſentence of excommunication is directed to be conſtantly denounced againſt all thoſe that by word, deed or counſel, act contrary thereto, or in any degree infringe it.

Next by a multitude of ſubſequent corroborating ſtatutes (Sir Edward Coke, I think, reckons thirty-two) from the Firſt Edward to Henry the Fourth. Then, after a long interval, by the Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Right; which was a parliamentary declaration of the liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the people, aſſented to by King Charles the Firſt in the beginning of his reign. Which was cloſely followed by the ſtill more ample conceſſions made by that unhappy Prince to his Parliament, before the fatal rupture between them; and by the many ſalutary laws, particularly the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> act, paſſed under Charles the Second. To theſe ſucceeded the Bill of Rights, or declaration delivered by the Lords and Commons to the Prince and Princeſs of Orange, February 13, 1688; and afterwards enacted in Parliament, when they became King and Queen: Which declaration concludes in theſe remarkable words: "And they do claim, demand, and inſiſt, upon all and ſingular the premiſes, as their undoubted rights and liberties." And the act of Parliament itſelf recognizes "all and ſingular the rights and liberties, aſſerted and claimed in the ſaid declaration, to be the true, ancient and indubitable rights of the people of this kingdom." Laſtly, theſe liberties were again aſſerted, at the commencement of the preſent century, in the act of ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, whereby the Crown was limited to his preſent Majeſty's illuſtrious houſe, and ſome new proviſions were added at the ſame fortunate aera, for better ſecuring our religion, laws, and liberties; which the ſtatute declares to be "the birthright of the people of England;" according to the ancient doctrine of the common law." The ſame elegant writer, who appears to poſſeſs the higheſt degree of information in legal hiſtory, obſerves, when ſpeaking of this palladium of liberty<note n="*" place="bottom">3 Blac. Com. 349, 350.</note>, that "it is a trial that hath been uſed time out of mind in this nation, and ſeems to have been coeval with the firſt civil government thereof. Some authors have endeavoured to trace the original of juries up as high as the Britons themſelves, the firſt inhabitants of our iſland; but certain it is, that they were in uſe among the earlieſt Saxon Colonies, their inſtitution being aſcribed by Biſhop Nicholſon to Woden himſelf, their great Legiſlator and Captain. Hence it is, that we may find traces of juries in the laws of all thoſe
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020825_0016_0FB0F8E30B686CE8"/>
nations which adopted the feodal ſyſtem, as in Germany, France, and Italy; who had all of them a tribunal compoſed of twelve good men and true, <hi>"boni homines,"</hi> uſually the vaſſals or tenants of the Lord, being equals or peers of the parties litigant: And, as the Lord's vaſſals, judged each other in the Lord's Courts; ſo the King's vaſſals, or the Lords themſelves, judged each other in the King's Court. In England we find actual mention of them ſo early as the laws of King Ethelred, and that not as a new invention. Stiernhook aſcribes the invention of the jury, which in the Teuto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic language is denominated <hi>nembda,</hi> to Regner, King of Sweden and Denmark, who was cotemporary with our King Egbert: Juſt as we are apt to impute the invention of this, and ſome other pieces of juridical polity, to the ſuperior genius of Alfred the Great; to whom, on account of his having done much, it is uſual to attribute every thing: And as the tradition of ancient Greece placed to the account of their own Hercules whatever atchievement was performed ſuperior to the ordinary proweſs of mankind. Whereas the truth ſeems to be, that this tribunal was univerſally eſtabliſhed among all the northern nations, and ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven in their very conſtitution, that the earlieſt accounts of the one give us alſo ſome traces of the other. Its eſtabliſhment however and uſe, in this iſland, of what date ſoever it be, though for a time greatly impaired and ſhaken by the introduction of the Norman trial by battle, was always ſo highly eſteemed and valued by the people, that no conqueſt, no change of government, could ever prevail to aboliſh it. In Magna Charta it is more than once inſiſted on as the principal bulwark of our liberties: But eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially, by cap. 29, that no freeman ſhall be hurt, in either his perſon or property, <hi>"niſi per legale judicium parium ſuorum vel per legem terrae."</hi> A privilege which is couched in almoſt the ſame words with that of the Emperor Conrad, two hundred years before: <hi>"Nemo beneficium ſuum perdat, niſi ſecundum conſuetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinem anteceſſorum noſtrorum et per judicium parium ſuorum."</hi> And it was ever eſteemed, in all countries, a privilege of the higheſt and moſt beneficial nature."</p>
            <p>FROM theſe paſſages in Judge Blackſtone's Commentaries, from the variety of authorities to which he refers, and from many
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020825_0017_0FB0F8E441E7F210"/>
others of the greateſt reputation, it moſt clearly appears, that the trial by jury was ever eſteemed a firſt, a fundamental, and a moſt eſſential principle, in the Engliſh conſtitution. From England this ſacred right was transferred to this country, and hath continued, through all the changes in our government, the firm baſis of our liberty, the faireſt inheritance tranſmitted by our anceſtors!</p>
            <p>THE ſettlers in this country, from whom we are deſcended, were Engliſhmen: They gloried in their rights as ſuch: But being perſecuted in matters of religion, over which no earthly tribunal can have the controul, they bravely determined to quit their native ſoil, to bid a final adieu to the alluring charms of their ſituation, and commit their future exiſtence to that Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Power, whoſe authority they dared not to infringe, but in whoſe protection they could ſafely confide. They tempted the foaming billows, they braved, they conquered the boiſterous Atlantic, and reſted in an howling wilderneſs, amidſt the horrid caverns of the untamed beaſts, and the more dangerous haunts of ſavage men! They retained their virtue, their religion, and their inviolable attachment to the conſtitutional rights of their former country. They did not withdraw or wiſh to withdraw themſelves from their allegiance to the Crown, but emigrated under a ſolemn aſſurance of receiving protection, ſo far as their ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation might require, and other circumſtances render practicable.</p>
            <p>THE laws of the realm, being the birthright of all the ſubjects, followed theſe pious adventurers to their new habitations, where, increaſing in numbers, amidſt innumerable difficulties, they were formed into Colonies by royal Charters, in nature of ſolemn com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacts, confirming and enlarging their privileges.</p>
            <p>IN the Charter granted to our forefathers, the following para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graph claims our particular attention: "That all and every the ſubjects of us, our heirs and ſucceſſors, which are already plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and ſettled within our ſaid Colony of Providence Plantations, which ſhall hereafter go to inhabit within the ſaid Colony, and all and every of their children, which have been born there, or
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:020825_0018_0FB0F8E5B097A6C8"/>
on the ſea going thither, or returning from thence, ſhall have and enjoy all liberties and immunities of free and natural ſubjects, within any of the dominions of us, our heirs or ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſors, to all intents, conſtructions and purpoſes whatſoever, as if they, and every of them, were born within the realm of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land."</p>
            <p>THIS conceſſion was declaratory of, and fully confirmed to the people the Magna Charta, and other fundamental laws of England. And accordingly, in the very firſt meeting of the General Aſſembly, after receiving the charter, in the year one thouſand ſix hundred and ſixty-three, they made and paſſed an act, "declaring the rights and privileges of his Majeſty's ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects within this Colony," whereby it is enacted, "<note n="*" place="bottom">State Laws, 226.</note> that no freeman ſhall be taken or impriſoned, or be deprived of his freehold or liberty, or free cuſtoms, or be outlawed, or exiled, or otherwiſe deſtroyed, nor ſhall be paſſed upon, judged or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, but by the lawful judgment of his peers, or by the laws of this Colony: And that no man, of what eſtate or condition ſoever, ſhall be put out of his lands and tenements, nor taken, nor impriſoned, nor diſinherited, nor baniſhed, nor any ways deſtroyed, nor moleſted, without for it being brought to anſwer by due courſe of law. And that all rights and privileges, grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this Colony by his Majeſty's Charter, be entirely kept and preſerved to all his Majeſty's ſubjects, reſiding in or belonging to the ſame."</p>
            <p>THIS act, may it pleaſe the Honourable Court, was not creative of a new law, but declaratory of the rights of all the people, as de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived through the Charter from their progenitors, time out of mind. It exhibited the moſt valuable part of their political con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and formed a ſacred ſtipulation that it ſhould never be violated. It would be a pleaſing, and perhaps an uſeful employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, to trace and point out the numerous inſtances wherein the General Aſſembly have re-aſſerted theſe ſolemn rights; but time will not admit of a minute detail. I cannot however be entirely ſilent upon this head.</p>

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:020825_0019_0FB0F8E886830DA0"/>AT their September ſeſſion, in the year one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſixty-five, "the General Aſſembly taking into the moſt ſerious conſideration an act, paſſed by the Britiſh Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment at their laſt ſeſſion, for levying ſtamp-duties, and other internal duties, in North-America, reſolved,</p>

            <p>AFTERWARDS, at October ſeſſion, in the year one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſixty-nine, they unanimouſly paſſed the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reſolution: "<note n="†" place="bottom">State Laws, new digeſt.</note> That all trials for treaſon, miſpriſion of trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, or for any felony or crime whatſoever, committed and done in his Majeſty's ſaid Colony and Dominion, by any perſon or perſons reſiding therein, ought of right to be had and conducted in and before his Majeſty's Courts held within the ſaid Colony, according to the fixed and known courſe of proceeding; and that the ſeizing any perſon or perſons, reſiding in this Colony, ſuſpected of any crime whatſoever, committed therein, and ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch perſon or perſons to places beyond the ſea to be tried, is highly derogatory of the rights of Britiſh ſubjects; as thereby the ineſtimable privilege of being tried by a jury from the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nage, as well as the liberty of ſummoning and producing wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes on ſuch trial, will be taken away from the party accuſed."</p>
            <p>THE attempts of the Britiſh Parliament to deprive us of this mode of trial were among the principal cauſes that united the Colonies in a defenſive war, and finally effected the glorious revolution. This is evident from the Declaration of Rights made by the firſt Congreſs, in October, in the year one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeventy-four: The preamble ſtates, "that the inhabitants of the Engliſh Colonies, in North-America, by
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:020825_0020_0FB0F8E9798F65B8"/>
the immutable laws of nature, the principles of the Engliſh con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, and the ſeveral charters and compacts, have the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing rights," the fifth of which is,</p>
            <p>"THAT the reſpective Colonies are entitled to the common law of England, and more eſpecially to the great and ineſtima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble privilege of being tried by their peers of the vicinage, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the courſe of that law."</p>
            <p>AT the ſame time they enumerated the ſeveral acts of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Parliament to which they declared they could not ſubmit, particularly "12 Geo. 3, chap. 24, intituled, "an act for the better ſecuring his Majeſty's dock-yards, magazines, ſhips, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition and ſtores," which declares a new offence in America, and deprives the American ſubject of a conſtitutional trial by jury of the vicinage, by authorizing the trial of any perſon charged with the committing any offence deſcribed in the act out of the realm, to be indicted and tried for the ſame in any ſhire or county within the realm."</p>
            <p>IN purſuance of the ſame principle, upon the ever memorable fourth of July, in the year one thouſand ſeven hundred and ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſix, when the rights of the United States were exhibited in a new blaze of glory! When, to ſupport them, the fathers of their country, "with a firm reliance on the protection of Divine Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, mutually pledged to each other their lives, their fortunes, and their ſacred honour!" When they ſubmitted "to a candid world" the catalogue of their complaints againſt the King of Great-Britain, they charged him with "depriving us, in many inſtances, of the benefits of trial by jury<note n="*" place="bottom">Art. Confederation.</note>."</p>
            <p>HERE let us pauſe!</p>
            <p>IF the firſt act of the Engliſh Parliament now upon record, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the great charter of the privileges of the ſubjects:—If the exerciſe of thoſe privileges for ages:—If the ſettlement of a new world to preſerve them:—If the firſt ſolemn compact of the people
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:020825_0021_0FB0F8EB9DCB2E98"/>
of this State:—If the ſacred declarations of the Legiſlature at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent periods, and upon the moſt important occaſions:—If the ſolemn appeal to heaven of the United States:—In ſhort, if the torrents of blood that have been ſhed in defence of our invaded rights, are proofs, then have we triumphed in the cauſe of huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, then have we ſhewn that the trial by jury is the birthright of the people!</p>
            <p>ASTONISHED am I, may it pleaſe the Honourable Court, that a doubt ſhould have ariſen in the mind of any, reſpecting the legal conſtruction of our Magna Charta, our declaration of rights! Some of our warmeſt politicians, whoſe heads are undoubtedly wrong, and it is greatly to be feared their hearts are not right, have bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted, that the clauſe which declares "that no freeman, &amp;c. ſhall be tried, &amp;c. but by the lawful judgment of his peers, or by the laws of the Colony," &amp;c. clearly authorizes any other mode of trial than that by jury, ſhould the Legiſlature frame a law for that purpoſe. That their act would become the law of the land, and ſo the ſpecial juriſdictions are perfectly conformable to the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and ſpirit of our conſtitution.</p>
            <p>IS it poſſible that theſe pretenders to the knowledge of law ſhould be ſerious, when they avow ſo dangerous an opinion?—If they are, let them be informed that they contradict the wiſdom and the practice of ages. That whenever a ſtatute makes mention of "the law of the land," it refers either to a particular pre-exiſting law, to the ſyſtem of laws in general, or to the mode of legal proceſs.</p>
            <p>LORD Coke, in his readings upon the ſtatute, hath fully de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated that the clauſe "or by the law of the land," regards the proceſs only. That the particle <hi>or</hi> is to be conſtrued con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctively. And ſo the ſentence will read, "by the lawful judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his peers, by, or according to, the law of the land," or, "and by the law of the land:" That is to ſay, by bill, plaint, information, or in any other legal manner.</p>
            <p>THERE are many inſtances in the books of a ſimilar conſtruction. I ſhall produce only one, <note n="*" place="bottom">2 Strange, 1175.</note> the caſe of Barker againſt Sureties.</p>

I give the ſaid premiſes to my grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, his heirs and aſſigns; but in caſe he dies before he attains the age of twenty-one years, <hi>or</hi> marriage, <hi>and</hi> without iſſue, then, and in ſuch caſe, he deviſed the ſame to the defendant. The fact was, the grandſon attained twenty-one, and died, having never been married. And it was inſiſted, that the attaining twenty-one was a performance of the condition, and veſted the eſtate abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely in the grandſon, under whom the leſſor of the plaintiff claimed.

And they ſaid they would read this without the word <hi>or,</hi> as if it run, "and if he dies before twenty-one, unmarried and without iſſue;" which he did not do, for one of the circumſtances failed. And all put together are but in the nature of one contingency; and it was conſiderable, that this was not a condition precedent, but to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy an eſtate deviſed by the former words in ſee."</p>

               <pb n="20" facs="unknown:020825_0023_0FB0F8EF421DBB98"/>THAT great oracle of the law, Lord Coke, records it in the following manner: "<note n="*" place="bottom">2 Inſt. 50, 51.</note> Againſt this ancient and fundamental law, (trial by jury) and in the face thereof, I find an act of Parliament made, that as well Juſtices of Aſſize, as Juſtices of Peace (with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any finding or preſentment of twelve men) upon a bare in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation for the King before them made, ſhould have full power and authority, by their diſcretion, to hear and determine all offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and contempts, committed or done by any perſon or perſons, againſt the form, ordinance and effect, of any ſtatute made and not repealed, &amp;c.—By colour of which act, ſhaking this funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental law, it is not credible what horrid oppreſſion and exactions, to the undoing of infinite numbers of people, were committed by Sir Richard Empſon and Edmund Dudley, being Juſtices of Peace through England. And upon this unjuſt and injurious act (as commonly in like caſes it falleth out) a new office was erected, and they made maſters of the King's forfeitures. But at the Parliament holden in the fiſt year of Henry VIII. this act of the eleventh of Henry VII. is recited and made void. For that by force of ſaid act it was manifeſtly known, that many ſiniſter and crafty, feigned and forged, informations had been purſued againſt divers of the King's ſubjects, to their great damage and wrongful vexation. And the ill ſucceſs hereof, and the fearful end of thoſe two oppreſſors, ſhould deter others from doing the like, and ſhould admoniſh Parliaments, that inſtead of this pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious trial by jury, they bring not in abſolute and partial trials by diſcretion."</p>
            <p>WELL may the countenances of certain gentlemen be chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—Well may their trembling limbs denote the perturbation of their minds.—Well may "their hearts quake within them." —For all others, who, like Empſon and Dudley, violate the conſtitutional laws of their country, deſerve, and, if they perſiſt in their career, will probably meet their fate!</p>
            <p>BUT we ſhall proceed, with the permiſſion of your Honours, to enquire, whether the Legiſlature can deprive the citizen of their conſtitutional right, the trial by jury.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:020825_0024_0FB0F8F03B518818"/>WHEN mankind entered into a ſtate of civil ſociety, they ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendered a part of their natural rights into the hands of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, that they might enjoy the remainder with greater ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. The aggregate of this ſurrender forms the power of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; the firſt and greateſt exerciſe of which conſtitutes legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or the power of making laws. Conſequently the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture cannot intermeddle with the retained rights of the people.</p>
            <p>IN the infant ſtate of ſociety, when the community conſiſted of but few members, when their wants and deſires were circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed within narrow bounds, the power of making laws was exerciſed by all the people aſſembled for that purpoſe, or at leaſt by the heads of families, who derived from nature a temporary authority over their offspring. Whatever was neceſſary for the good or ſafety of the whole was agreed to, and each individual engaged to abide by the opinion of the majority. Such was the ſituation of our anceſtors, when they firſt ſettled in this country.</p>
            <p>AS ſociety increaſed in numbers and wealth, as their ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments were extended, and their views enlarged, it became neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to delegate the powers of legiſlation, and veſt them in one perſon, in a few, or in many, as the community deemed moſt conducive to their common advantage. Such was the ſituation of our anceſtors, when they petitioned to King Charles II. to be incorporated into a company, with the power of governing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves. Firſt by making of laws in a General Aſſembly, to be convened twice in each year, compoſed of magiſtrates elected annually by the freemen at large, and of deputies choſen ſemi-annually from the reſpective towns as their repreſentatives. And ſecondly, by carrying thoſe laws into execution, by judiciary eſtabliſhments.</p>
            <p>THE powers of legiſlation, in every poſſible inſtance, are derived from the people at large, are altogether fiduciary, and ſubordinate to the aſſociation by which they are formed. Were there no bounds to limit and circumſcribe the Legiſlature; were they to be actuated by their own will, independent of the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental rules of the community, the government would be a
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:020825_0025_0FB0F8F1B5FF8068"/>
government of men, and not of laws. And whenever the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors depart from their original engagements, and attempt to make laws derogatory to the general principles they were bound to ſupport, they become tyrants. "<note n="*" place="bottom">Locke on Gov. 392.</note> For ſince it can never be ſuppoſed, as Mr. Locke well obſerves, to be the will of the ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, that the Legiſlative ſhould have a power to deſtroy that which every one deſigns to ſecure, by entering into ſociety, and for which the people ſubmitted themſelves to legiſlators of their own making, whenever the legiſlators endeavour to take away and deſtroy the property of the people, or to reduce them to ſlavery under arbitrary power, they put themſelves into a ſtate of war with the people." And again<note n="‡" place="bottom">P. 298.</note>, "when the legiſlators act con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the end for which they were conſtituted, thoſe who are guilty, are guilty of rebellion."</p>
            <p>THE powers of our Legiſlature are ſo clearly defined in the Charter, which is concluſive evidence of the compact of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, as well as of the royal intention, that a recurrence to them will greatly aſſiſt us in the preſent queſtion. Let us attend there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore to the following paſſage: "And that they (the General Aſſembly) or the greateſt part of them then preſent, whereof the Governor or Deputy-Governor, and ſix of the Aſſiſtants, at leaſt to be ſeven, ſhall have, and have hereby, given and granted unto them, full power and authority, from time to time, and at all times hereafter, to make, ordain, conſtitute, or repeal ſuch laws, ſtatutes, orders and ordinances, forms and ceremonies of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and magiſtracy, as to them ſhall ſeem meet, for the good and welfare of the ſaid Company, and for the government and ordering the lands and hereditaments herein after mentioned to be granted, and of the people that do, or at any time hereafter ſhall, inhabit or be within the ſame; ſo as ſuch laws, ordinances and conſtitutions, ſo made, be not contrary and repugnant unto, but, as near as may be, agreeable to the laws of this our realm of England, conſidering the nature and conſtitution of the place and people there."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:020825_0026_0FB0F8F32F0AB980"/>THIS grant, which was obtained in conſequence of an aſſocia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all the people for that purpoſe, expreſsly limits the legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative powers; and by invariable cuſtom and uſage they are ſtill ſo confined, that they cannot make any laws repugnant to the general ſyſtem of laws which governed the realm of England at the time of the grant. The revolution hath made no change in this reſpect, ſo as to abridge the people of the means of ſecuring their lives, liberty and property: To preſerve which they have ever conſidered the trial by jury the moſt effectual.</p>
            <p>THERE are certain general principles that are equally binding in all governments, more eſpecially thoſe which define the nature and extent of legiſlation. I do not recollect of having ever ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved them ſo clearly and elegantly deſcribed, as in a treatiſe written by M. de Vattel, upon the laws of nations and of nature. I ſhall introduce him, therefore, as he is tranſlated, in his own words.</p>
            <p>"<note n="*" place="bottom">Vattel, P. 12.</note>IN the act of aſſociation, in virtue of which a multitude of men form together a ſtate or nation, each individual has en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into engagements with all, to procure the common wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare; and all have entered into engagements with each individual to facilitate for him the means of ſupplying his neceſſities, and to protect and defend him. It is manifeſt that theſe reciprocal engagements can no otherwiſe be fulfilled, than by maintaining the political aſſociation. The entire nation is then obliged to maintain that aſſociation; and as in its duration the preſervation of the nation conſiſts, it follows from thence that every nation is obliged to perform the duty of ſelf-preſervation."</p>
            <p>"<note n="‖" place="bottom">Vattel, P. 17.</note>THE conſtitution and its laws are the baſis of the public tranquility, the firmeſt ſupport of the public authority, and pledge of the liberty of the citizens. But this conſtitution is a vain phantom, and the beſt laws are uſeleſs, if they are not reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly obſerved. The nation ought then to watch very atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively, in order to render them equally reſpected by thoſe who govern, and by the people deſtined to obey. To attack the
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:020825_0027_0FB0F8F4AFF102A0"/>
conſtitution of the State, and to violate its laws, is a capital crime againſt ſociety; and if thoſe guilty of it are inveſted with autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, they add to this crime a perfidious abuſe of the power with which they are intruſted. The nation ought conſtantly to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs theſe abuſes with its utmoſt vigour and vigilance, as the importance of the caſe requires. It is very uncommon to ſee the laws and conſtitution of a State openly and boldly oppoſed: It is againſt ſilent and ſlow attacks that a nation ought to be particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly on its guard."</p>
            <p>BUT here, the attack is open and bold;—it comes with violence;—it moves with huge gigantic ſtrides, and threatens ſlavery or death!—</p>
            <p>"<note n="*" place="bottom">Vattel, P. 18<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </note>A VERY important queſtion here preſents itſelf. It eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially belongs to the ſociety to make laws, both in relation to the manner in which it deſires to be governed, and to the conduct of the citizens. This is called the legiſlative power. The nation may entruſt the exerciſe of it to the Prince, or to an Aſſembly; or to that Aſſembly and the Prince jointly; who have then a right of making new, and abrogating old laws. It is here de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, whether, if their power extends ſo far as to the funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental laws, they may change the conſtitution of the State? The principles we have laid down lead us to decide this point with certainty, that the authority of theſe legiſlators does not extend ſo far; and that they ought to conſider the fundamental laws as ſacred, if the nation has not, in very expreſs terms, given them the power to change them. For the conſtitution of the State ought to be fixed; and ſince that was firſt eſtabliſhed by the nation, which afterwards truſted certain perſons with the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive power, the fundamental laws are excepted from their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion. It appears that the ſociety had only reſolved to make proviſion for the State's being always furniſhed with laws ſuited to particular conjunctures; and gave the Legiſlature, for that purpoſe, the power of abrogating the ancient, civil and political laws that were not fundamental, and of making new ones; but nothing leads us to think that it was willing to ſubmit the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:020825_0028_0FB0F8F720B97CB8"/>
itſelf to their pleaſure. In ſhort, theſe legiſlators derive their power from the conſtitution; how then can they change it, without deſtroying the foundation of their authority?"</p>
            <p>HAVE the citizens of this State ever entruſted their legiſlators with the power of altering their conſtitution?—If they have, when and where was the ſolemn meeting of all the people for that pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe?—By what public inſtrument have they declared it, or in what part of their conduct have they betrayed ſuch extravagance and folly?—For what have they contended through a long, painful and bloody war, but to ſecure inviolate, and tranſmit un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſullied to poſterity, the ineſtimable privileges they received from their forefathers?—Will they ſuffer the glorious price of all their toils to be wreſted from them, and loſt forever, by the men of their own creating?—They who have ſnatched their liberty from the jaws of the Britiſh lion, amidſt the thunders of contending nations, will they baſely ſurrender it to the Adminiſtration of a year?—As ſoon may the great Michael kick the beam, and Lucifer riot in the ſpoils of angels!—</p>
            <p>CONSTITUTION!—we have none:—Who dares to ſay that?—None but a Britiſh emiſſary, or a traitor to his country. —Are there any ſuch amongſt us?—The language hath been heard, and God forbid that they ſhould continue!</p>
            <p>IF we have not a conſtitution, by what authority doth our General Aſſembly convene to make laws, and levy taxes? Their appointment by the freemen of the towns, excluding the idea of a pre-exiſting ſocial compact, cannot ſeparately give them power to make laws compulſory upon the other towns. They could only meet, in that caſe, to form a ſocial compact between the people of the towns. But they do meet by the appointment of their reſpective towns, at ſuch times and places, and in ſuch num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, as they have been accuſtomed to do from the beginning. When met, they make laws and levy taxes, and their conſtituents obey thoſe laws, and pay their taxes. Conſequently they meet, deliberate and enact, in virtue of a conſtitution, which, if they attempt to deſtroy, or in any manner infringe, they violate the
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:020825_0029_0FB0F8F872C037D0"/>
truſt repoſed in them, and ſo their acts are not to be conſidered as laws, or binding upon the people.</p>
            <p>BUT as the Legiſlative is the ſupreme power in government, who is to judge whether they have violated the conſtitutional rights of the people?—I anſwer, their ſupremacy (conſiſting in the power of making laws, agreeably to their appointment) is derived from the conſtitution, is ſubordinate to it, and therefore, whenever they attempt to enſlave the people, and carry their attempts into execution, the people themſelves will judge, as the only reſort in the laſt ſtages of oppreſſion. But when they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no farther than merely to enact what they may call laws, and refer thoſe to the Judiciary Courts for determination, then, (in diſcharge of the great truſt repoſed in them, and to prevent the horrors of a civil war, as in the preſent caſe) the Judges can, and we truſt your Honours will, decide upon them.—</p>
            <p>IN deſpotic countries, where the ſovereign mandate iſſues from the throne ſurrounded by ſervile flatterers, ſycophants and knaves, the Judge hath nothing more to do than execute. His office is altogether miniſterial, being the paſſive tool of that lawleſs domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation by which he was appointed. Properly ſpeaking, the judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciary power cannot exiſt where political freedom is baniſhed from the adminiſtration. For without a ſyſtem of laws, defining and protecting the rights of the people, there can be no fixed principles or rules of deciſion. Hence it is, that wherever the diſtinct pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of government are united in one head, whether that head con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts of one, or of many, the ſubjects groan under perpetual ſervitude.</p>
            <p>I SAY of one or of many: For it is very immaterial by whom ſcourges, chains and tortures, are inflicted, provided we muſt ſubmit to them. The ſtudied and unheard of cruelties of a Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onyſius, who violated every right of humanity in his tyranny over the Syracuſians during the ſpace of thirty-eight years, were not more horrid and execrable than the united barbarities of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of Thirty, eſtabliſhed at Athens, who cauſed more citizens to be murdered in eight months of peace, than their enemies had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed in a thirty years war!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:020825_0030_0FB0F8F9FA3AD858"/>NOR am I capable of diſtinguiſhing between an eſtabliſhed ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, and that government where the Legiſlative makes the law, and dictates to the Judges their adjudication. For in that caſe, were they to enact tyrannical laws, they would be ſure to have them executed in a tyrannical manner. The ſervility of the Courts would render them totally ſubſervient to the will of their maſters, and the people muſt be inſlaved, or fly to arms.</p>
            <p>IN civil as well as moral agency there is a freedom of the will neceſſarily exerted in forming the judgment. Without the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of this, we cannot be ſaid to determine at all, but our actions are wholly paſſive; and ſo, in a moral ſenſe, we could not be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, and in a civil point of view we ſhould be deprived of all liberty.</p>
            <p>EVERY being naturally endeavours its own preſervation; and the more conformably its actions are to its nature, the nearer it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches to perfection: But when its actions are impelled by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal force, it is deprived of the means both of preſervation and of perfection.</p>
            <p>A NATION may be conſidered as a moral being, whoſe health and ſtrength conſiſt in the due proportion, nice adjuſtment and equal preſervation, of all its parts: And when one branch of the government ſteps into the place of another, and uſurps its func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the health and the ſtrength of the nation are impaired: And ſhould the evil be continued, ſo as that the one be deſtroyed by the other, the nation itſelf would be in danger of diſſolution.</p>
            <p>HAVE the Judges a power to repeal, to amend, to alter laws, or to make new laws?—God forbid!—In that caſe they would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come Legiſlators.—Have the Legiſlators power to direct the Judges how they ſhall determine upon the laws already made?— God forbid!—In that caſe they would become Judges.—The true diſtinction lies in this, that the Legiſlative have the incontroul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able power of making laws not repugnant to the conſtitution:— The Judiciary have the ſole power of judging of thoſe laws, and are bound to execute them; but cannot admit any act of the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative as law, which is againſt the conſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:020825_0031_0FB0F8FB6F91A878"/>THE Judges ſworn "truly and impartially to execute the laws that now are or ſhall hereafter be made, according to the beſt of their ſtill and underſtanding." They are alſo ſworn "to bear true allegiance and fidelity to this State of Rhode-Iſland and Providence Plantations, as a free, ſovereign and independent State." But this became a State in order to ſupport its fundamental, conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional laws, againſt the encroachments of Great-Britain. The trial by jury, as hath been fully ſhewn, is a fundamental, a conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional law; and therefore is binding upon the Judges by a double tie, the oath of allegiance, and the oath of office.</p>
            <p>IT is a rule in ethics, "that if two duties or obligations, both of which cannot be performed, urge us at the ſame time, we muſt omit the leſſer, and embrace the greater."</p>
            <p>LET the queſtion then fairly be ſtated. The General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have made a law, and directed the Judges to execute it by a mode of trial repugnant to the conſtitution. What are the Judges to reſolve?—Did the nature of their juriſdiction admit of ſuch a mode of trial at the times of their appointment and taking the oath of office?—Surely it did not. The act of Aſſembly then erects a new office, the exerciſe of which, other things equal, they may undertake, or refuſe, at their own option. There is no duty, no obligation in the way. In refuſing, they incur no pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty; nor can their ſo doing work a forfeiture of their offices as Judges of the Supreme Judiciary Court. But when it is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that the exerciſe of this office would be acting contrary to their oath of allegiance, and the oath of office, they are bound to reject it, unleſs the General Aſſembly have power to abſolve them from theſe oaths, and compel them to accept of any appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they may be pleaſed to make.</p>
            <p>I HAVE heard ſome gentlemen ſpeak of the laws of the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Aſſembly.—I know of no ſuch laws, diſtinct from the laws of the State. The idea is dangerous; it borders upon treaſon!— "<note n="*" place="bottom">Shakeſpeare.</note> 'tis rank—it ſmells to heaven!"</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:020825_0032_0FB0F8FD136DA5E8"/>LAWS are <hi>made</hi> by the General Aſſembly under the powers they derive from the conſtitution, but when made they become the laws of the land, and as ſuch the Court is ſworn to execute them. But if the General Aſſembly attempt to make laws con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary hereunto, the Court cannot receive them as laws; they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſubmit to them. If they ſhould, let me ſpeak it with reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, they would incur the guilt of a double perjury!</p>
            <p>THE life, liberty and property of the citizens are ſecured by the general law of the State. We will then ſuppoſe (as the very nature of the argument allows us to view the ſubject in every poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble light) that the General Aſſembly ſhould paſs an act directing that no citizen ſhould leave his houſe, nor ſuffer any of his family to move out of the ſame, for the ſpace of ſix months, upon the pain of death. This would be contrary to the laws of nature.—Suppoſe they ſhould enact that every parent ſhould deſtroy his firſt-born child. This would be contrary to the laws of God.—But, upon the common principles, the Court would be as much bound to execute theſe acts as any others. For if they can determine up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any act, that it is not law, and ſo reject it, they muſt neceſſarily have the power of determining <hi>what</hi> acts are laws, and ſo on the contrary. There is no middle line. The Legiſlative hath power to go all lengths, or not to overleap the bounds of its appointment at all. So it is with the Judiciary; it muſt reject all acts of the Legiſlative that are contrary to the truſt repoſed in them by the people, or it muſt adopt all.</p>
            <p>BUT the Judges, and all others, are bound by the laws of nature in preference to any human laws, becauſe they were ordained by God himſelf anterior to any civil or political inſtitutions. They are bound, in like manner, by the principles of the conſtitution in preference to any acts of the General Aſſembly, becauſe they were ordained by the people anterior to and created the powers of the General Aſſembly.</p>
            <p>THIS mode of reaſoning will equally apply in law as in philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy. For wherever there is a given force applied to put a body in motion, that motion will continue until the body is oppoſed by
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:020825_0033_0FB0F901414568B0"/>
an equal or a greater force. And the Judges being ſworn to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the fundamental laws, they muſt continue to execute them un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til they ſhall be controuled by laws of a ſuperior nature. But that can never happen until all the people aſſemble for the purpoſe of making a new conſtitution. And indeed I very much doubt if the citizens of any one State have power to adopt ſuch a kind of government, as to exclude the trial by jury, conſiſtently with the principles of the confederation.</p>
            <p>IT having been ſhewn that this Court poſſeſſes all the powers in this State, that the Courts of King's Bench, Common Pleas, and Exchequer, poſſeſs in England, let us turn to the authorities, and obſerve the adjudications of thoſe Courts in ſimilar caſes.</p>

of the Adminiſtration, or any other, that will ſell his beef, his pork, his corn, or his cheeſe, ſo as to enable the retailers and huxters to ſell thoſe articles again for paper, at the ſame rate they could be afforded for ſilver or gold? There is not. What's the conſequence?—Every evil-minded perſon in the State is invited by law to turn informer (a moſt deſpicable office) and more than five hundred proſecutions would take place in the courſe of a week! —Horrid reflection!—The idle, the profligate, the abandoned of every character, would appear in the group of proſecutors or wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, urged and puſhed on by petty Conventions and deſigning Juntos, till perjury would run down our ſtreets like a ſtream, and violence like a mighty river!—The Judges themſelves might be tempted, by the perquiſites of office, to encourage informations, until every man of induſtry, of buſineſs, and of property, muſt quit the State, retire from buſineſs, give up his property, or join in an oppoſition of force!—The temptation is great, and ſeriouſly alarming! For to ſecure the Judges individually, and their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal influence, the very emitting act directs that they ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive all monies tendered and refuſed for paſt contracts, and at the expiration of three months depoſite them in the General-Treaſury. What room for ſpeculation, what inducement to corruption, what incentives to depreciate the currency!</p>
            <p>OH! it is an abominable act! Yet ſome there are, and, to our ſhame be it ſpoken, too many, who tend it, who nurſe it, who hug it to their boſom as a darling child.

            <p>WE again read in Bacon's Abridgment, that <note n="*" place="bottom">4 vol. 643.</note> "the power of conſtruing a ſtatute is in the Judges; for they have authority over all laws, more eſpecially over ſtatutes, to mould them ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to reaſon and convenience to the beſt and trueſt uſe."</p>
            <p>HERE the author refers to Hobart, Plowden, and Lord Coke, who fully juſtify the doctrine he advances. They are upon the table, and will be produced, if your Honours require it; but we preſume it would be only treſpaſſing upon your patience, too much exhauſted already, by a tedious diſcuſſion.</p>
            <p>THE ſatisfaction you are pleaſed to expreſs upon this head, enables us to purſue the ſubject in another point of view. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps there is not a civilized country on earth, where ſo ſmall a portion of natural liberty is given into the ſtock of political ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, as by the people of this State. There is a certain period in every year when the powers of government ſeem to expire; for the authority of the old officers ceaſes with the appointment of the new, and theſe cannot act until they are commiſſioned and ſworn. The Legiſlative of one Houſe being compoſed of new members, or members newly elected twice in the year, feels and carries into effect the ſentiments of the people, founded upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremes of liberty. The electors in the reſpective towns have generally ſome point to obtain; or, which is more unfriendly to public liberty, they are divided by parties, and ſo the members elected become the advocates of local, intereſted meaſures, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out comparing them with the more extenſive objects of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. The ſeſſions ſeldom exceed the limits of a week: New laws are propoſed, acted upon and adopted, according to the firſt or the preconcerted impreſſions of paſſion, without time for deliberation or reflection. The Upper Houſe, it is true, hath a negative upon the Houſe of Deputies; but they never perſiſt in exerciſing it without endangering their next election. The appointment of the Judges, Juſtices of the Peace, and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:020825_0037_0FB0F906B45FF198"/>
other officers of government, being made by the members of both Houſes in a Grand Committee, is very often the reſult of political arrangements; and more attention is paid to the carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of certain points, than to the qualification of the candidates; ſo that the people feel no great reſtraint from this quarter.</p>
            <p>WHAT is there then, in the nature of our government, to prevent anarchy and confuſion on the one hand, or tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny and oppreſſion on the other?—Before the revolution, the King, as Supreme Executive, formed the balance; but ſince, the Executive Power hath become blended with the Legiſlative, and we have not, like the other States in the union, adopted any ſubſtitute for this defect.</p>
            <p>THE moment therefore that this Court feels itſelf dependent upon the Legiſlature, in the exerciſe of its judiciary powers, there will be an end of political liberty: For there is not an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual of mankind but wiſhes, if poſſible, to be exempt from the compacts that bind others. And there may be conjunctures in which the love of natural liberty will bid defiance to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraints of law, if the Legiſlature are blindly guided by the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral impulſe. Or ſhould theſe attachments be more ſtrongly fixed to the intereſts of a few deſigning men than to the public wiſh, tyranny would ſpring out of anarchy. In either caſe, the interpoſition of the Judiciary may ſave the conſtitution, at leaſt for a time; and, by averting the immediate evil, will give ſcope for reflection, and ſo prevent a diſſolution of government.</p>
            <p>IT is extremely to be regretted, that this Court is not as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependent in the tenure by which the Judges hold their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, as they are in the exerciſe of their judicial proceedings. The frequent changes that ariſe from annual appointments may have an influence upon legal deciſions, and ſo deſtroy that uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity which is eſſentially requiſite to the ſecurity of individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als. But from theſe conſiderations we have nothing to fear upon the preſent occaſion: For the knowledge, the integrity, the firmneſs of the Bench, will riſe ſuperior to every obſtacle; and
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:020825_0038_0FB0F9082F86ABF8"/>
the dignity of their determinations will diſplay a luſtre awful even to tyranny itſelf!</p>
            <p>TO this Honourable Court the warmeſt thanks of the defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant, of this aſſembly, of every citizen, are due, for their ſoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citous attention to their unalienable rights!

            <p>I CANNOT further purſue the ſubject, but muſt come to a concluſion.</p>
            <p>WE have attempted to ſhew, that the act, upon which the information is founded, hath expired:—That by the act ſpecial juriſdictions are erected, incontroulable by the Supreme Judici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary Court of the State:—And that, by the act, this Court is not authorized or empowered to impannel a jury to try the facts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the information:—That the trial by jury is a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, a conſtitutional right—ever claimed as ſuch—ever ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified as ſuch—ever held moſt dear and ſacred:—That the Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlative derives all its authority from the conſtitution—hath no power of making laws but in ſubordination to it—cannot in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringe or violate it:—That therefore the act is unconſtitutional and void:—That this Court hath power to judge and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what acts of the General Aſſembly are agreeable to the conſtitution; and, on the contrary, that this Court is under the moſt ſolemn obligations to execute the laws of the land, and therefore cannot, will not, conſider this act as a law of the land.</p>

            <head>The CASE of the JUDGES.</head>
            <p>THE conſequences of the foregoing determination were immediately felt. The ſhops and ſtores were generally opened, and buſineſs aſſumed a chearful aſpect. Few were the exceptions to a general congratulation, and laviſh indeed were the praiſes beſtowed upon the Court. The dread and the idea of informations were baniſhed together, while a moſt perfect confidence was placed in judicial ſecurity. The paper currency obtained a more extenſive circulation, as every one found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf at liberty to receive or refuſe it. The markets, which had been illy ſupplied, were now amply furniſhed, and the ſpirit of induſtry was generally diffuſed. Every proſpect teemed with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning happineſs, and nothing appeared wanting to reſtore union and harmony among the contending parties.</p>
            <p>THE demon however of diſcord was not entirely ſubdued; for upon the next ſucceeding week a ſummons was iſſued from both Houſes of Aſſembly, requiring an immediate attendance of the Judges, "to render their reaſons for adjudging an act of the General Aſſembly unconſtitutional, and ſo void." Three of the Judges attended, the other two being unwell. This cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance induced the Aſſembly to diſmiſs them at that time, but they were directed to appear at the October ſeſſion next following.</p>
            <p>ACCORDINGLY three of the Judges attended, and gave notice in writing to both Houſes, "that they waited their pleaſure." They were informed that the Aſſembly was ready to hear them, and would proceed immediately upon the buſineſs for which they were in attendance.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="38" facs="unknown:020825_0041_0FB0F91082642308"/>CERTAIN ceremonies being adjuſted, and the records of the Court produced, the Honourable Mr. Howell, the youngeſt Juſtice, addreſſed himſelf to the Aſſembly in a very learned, ſenſible and elaborate diſcourſe, in which he was upwards of ſix hours upon the floor.</p>
            <p>HE obſerved, that the order by which the Judges were before the Houſe might be conſidered as calling upon them to aſſiſt in matters of legiſlation, or to render the reaſons of their judicial determination, as being accountable to the Legiſlature for their judgment.</p>
            <p>THAT in the former point of view, the Court was ever ready, as conſtituting the legal counſellors of the State, to render every kind of aſſiſtance to the Legiſlative, in framing new, or repeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing former laws: But that for the reaſons of their judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on any queſtion judicially before them, they were accountable only to God, and their own conſciences.</p>
            <p>UNDER the firſt head, the honourable gentleman pointed out the objectionable parts of the act upon which the information was founded, and moſt clearly demonſtrated, by a variety of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive arguments, that it was unconſtitutional, had not the force of a law, and could not be executed. His arguments were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forced by many authorities of the firſt eminence, in addition to thoſe produced upon the trial. But as this part of the ſubject hath in a great meaſure been anticipated, we ſhall not enter into a further detail, concluding that the legal defence of the Court, in ſhewing "that they were not accountable to the Legiſlature for the reaſons of their judgment," will be more intereſting to the public.</p>
            <p>HERE it was obſerved, that the Legiſlature had aſſumed a fact, in their ſummons to the Judges, which was not juſtified of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted by the records. The plea of the defendant, in a matter of mere ſurpluſſage, mentions the act of the General Aſſembly as "unconſtitutional, and ſo void;" but the judgment of the Court ſimply is, "that the information is not cognizable before
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:020825_0042_0FB0F911F6D3CFF8"/>
them." Hence it appears that the plea hath been miſtaken for the judgment.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER might have been the opinion of the Judges, they ſpoke by their records, which admitted of no addition or dimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nution. They might have been influenced reſpectively by dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent reaſons, as the whole act was judicially before them, of which, it being general, they could judge by inſpection, without confining themſelves to the particular points ſtated in the plea. It would be out of the power, therefore, of the General Aſſembly to determine upon the propriety of the Court's judgment, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a particular explanation. If this could be required in one inſtance, it might in all; and ſo the Legiſlative would become the Supreme Judiciary. A perverſion of power totally ſubver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive of civil liberty!</p>
            <p>IF it be conceded, that the equal diſtribution of juſtice is as requiſite to anſwer the purpoſes of government as the enacting of ſalutary laws, it is evident that the Judiciary Power ſhould be as independent as the Legiſlative. And conſequently the Judges cannot be anſwerable for their opinion, unleſs charged with cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minality.</p>
            <p>THE nature of their office obliges them to decide upon every queſtion that can ariſe in legal proceſs. If they are not directed by their own underſtanding, uninfluenced by the opinion of others, how can they be ſaid to judge at all?—The very act of judging, ſuppoſes an aſſent of the mind to the truth or falſhood of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. And if a deciſion is given contrary to this aſſent, the Judge is guilty of perjury, and ought to be rendered infamous.</p>
            <p>EVERY man is excuſable for errors of the head, provided ſufficient attention hath been paid to the means of information: But no man is excuſable for pravity or corruption of the heart.</p>
            <p>THE Judges may err: For error is the lot of humanity. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection cannot be required of imperfect beings. But the very idea of being accountable to the Legiſlature, in matters of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:020825_0043_0FB0F91441FE3548"/>
ſuppoſes the Legiſlature to poſſeſs the ſtandard of perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. A thought highly derogatory to the attributes of Deity!</p>

Were it joined with the Legiſlative, the life and liberty of the ſubject would be expoſed to arbitrary controul; for the Judge would then be the Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor.

            <p>JUDGE Blackſtone in his Commentaries hath adopted the ſame ideas.—Serjeant Hawkins is preciſe and concluſive, <note n="†" place="bottom">2 H. P. C. c. 1, ſect. 17.</note> "that no ſuch Judge is in any way puniſhable for a mere error of judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment."</p>

Yet if a Judge will ſo far forget the dignity and honour of his poſt, as to turn ſolicitor in a cauſe which he is to judge, and privately and extrajudicially tamper with witneſſes, or labour jurors, he hath no reaſon to complain, if he be dealt with ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the ſame capacity to which he ſo baſely degrades himſelf."—</p>
            <p>COMPARING theſe paſſages together, the intention of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor is apparent, that, in the firſt place, the Judges are not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable at all for mere error of judgment; and in the ſecond, they are triable only in Parliament for matters of a criminal nature.</p>
            <p>THE ſame point is fully aſſerted in Bacon: <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Bacon's Abr. 555.</note> "But though they are to judge according to the ſettled and eſtabliſhed rules and an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient cuſtoms of the nation, approved for many ſucceſſions of ages, yet are they freed from all proſecutions for any thing done by them in Court, which appears to have been an error of their judgment."</p>
            <p>SO tender and delicate is the law in this reſpect, that even Juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices of the Peace are ſacredly guarded from every kind of proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon account of their opinion.</p>
            <p>UPON the 10th of May, 1757, a motion was made in the King's Bench <note n="†" place="bottom">Burrows, 556.</note> "for an information againſt two Juſtices of the Peace, for arbitrarily, obſtinately and unreaſonably refuſing to grant a licence to one Henry Day, to keep an inn at Everſley; where it was alledged and ſworn to be fit and proper, and even ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, that there ſhould be an additional one (there being one there already) and for which occupation of keeping an inn this man was (as thoſe two Juſtices themſelves had allowed on a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer occaſion) a proper perſon, they having before licenced him to do ſo at another place.</p>

            <p>JUDGE Tillinghaſt obſerved, that nothing could have induced the gentlemen of the Court to accept the office to which they were appointed, but a regard to the public good: That their perquiſites were trifling, and their ſalaries not worth mentioning. The only recompence they expected, or could receive, was a conſciouſneſs
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:020825_0046_0FB0F91D372D2AF8"/>
of rectitude, which had ſupported them, and he was confident would ſupport them, through every change of circumſtances: That melancholy indeed would be the condition of the citizens, if the Supreme Judiciary of the State was liable to reprehenſion, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the caprice or the reſentment of a few leading men ſhould direct a public enquiry!—</p>
            <p>THAT, as one member of the Court, he felt himſelf perfectly independent, while moving in the circle of his duty:—And however he might be affected for the honour of the State, he was wholly indifferent about any conſequences that might poſſibly reſpect himſelf.</p>
            <p>THAT the opinion he had given reſulted from mature reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the cleareſt conviction:—That his conſcience teſtified to the purity of his intentions, and he was happy in the perſuaſion, that his conduct met the approbation of his God!</p>

               <p>MY brethren have ſo fully declared my ſentiments upon this occaſion, that I have nothing to add by way of argument. It gives me pain that the conduct of the Court ſeems to have met the diſpleaſure of the Adminiſtration. But their obligations were of too ſacred a nature for them to aim at pleaſing but in the line of their duty.—</p>
               <p>IT is well known that my ſentiments have fully accorded with the general ſyſtem of the Legiſlature in emitting the paper curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: But I never did, I never will, depart from the character of an honeſt, man, to ſupport any meaſures, however agreeable in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.—If there could have been a prepoſſeſſion in my mind, it muſt have been in favour of the act of the General Aſſembly; but it was not poſſible to reſiſt the force of conviction. The opinion I gave upon the trial was dictated by the energy of truth: I thought it right—I ſtill think ſo. Be it as it may, we derived our underſtanding from the Almighty, and to him only are we accountable for our judgment.</p>

               <pb n="44" facs="unknown:020825_0047_0FB0F91EE2F1D4D0"/>TO the obſervations of the Judges, ſucceeded a very ſerious and intereſting debate among the members, wherein many argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and obſervations were adduced on both ſides. At length a queſtion was taken, "whether the Aſſembly was ſatisfied with the reaſons given by the Judges in ſupport of their judgment?"— It was determined in the negative.</p>
            <p>A MOTION was then made, and ſeconded, "for diſmiſſing the Judges from their office."</p>
            <p>THIS was coming to the point, for the obtaining of which the greateſt exertions had been made. Candidates were upon the ſpot ready to fill the ſeats thus to be made vacant, whom a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of ſucceſs had rendered very important.</p>
            <p>UPON a queſtion of ſo unprecedented and ſo intereſting a nature, many of the leading gentlemen of the Adminiſtration ſeemed al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ready to yield the ground upon which they had contended.— Some were for diſplacing the Judges at all events; ſome were for ſaving appearances by drawing out a conceſſion on the part of the Court, and others were determined fully to juſtify them, when the following memorial was preſented, which gave a new turn to the deliberations.—</p>

            <p>THIS memorial being received, the Judges informed the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, that they had directed counſel to enforce its contents, and requeſted an hearing accordingly. Whereupon the author, having addreſſed the Houſe in the uſual manner, obſerved,</p>
            <p>THAT the neceſſity of exhibiting the memorial upon the table, aroſe from the motion laſt made by one of their honourable mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, for diſmiſſing the Judges from office, without any previous charge of criminality. A meaſure ſo novel as this motion tended to produce, could not have been foreſeen or expected; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it would not be thought ſtrange if the counſel was not fully prepared to meet and oppoſe it.</p>
            <p>WHAT do the Judges pray for?—That if they are to be paſſed upon for any thing reſpecting their duty, they may firſt know for what offence they are to be judged: That the particular charge or charges may be ſpecified: That they may have time for defence:
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:020825_0050_0FB0F92332F3EA30"/>
That they may be heard before a tribunal legally conſtituted; and that they be heard by counſel.—</p>
            <p>IS there a gentleman in this Aſſembly ſo inattentive to the rights of his conſtituents, as to refuſe, upon this occaſion, what the loweſt peaſant, nay the vileſt criminal, is entitled to receive?—I preſume there is not. And notwithſtanding many of them may ſuppoſe that the honour of the Legiſlature is wounded by the deciſion of the Court, and ſo would wiſh to reſtore it, even by ſacrificing the Judges; yet I am confident they will not incur the imputation of real diſgrace, by removing the barriers to perſonal ſecurity, and the preſervation of property. For if they would preſerve in the minds of the citizens an attachment to their meaſures, and a veneration for their laws, they certainly will not openly violate the laws themſelves.</p>
            <p>BE pleaſed to recollect a paragraph in our Declaration of Rights, our Magna Charta, wherein it is provided, "that no man, of what eſtate and condition ſoever, ſhall be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of his lands and tenements, nor taken, nor impriſoned, nor diſinherited, nor baniſhed, nor any ways deſtroyed, nor moleſted, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it brought to anſwer <hi>by due courſe of law."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WAS it in the power of the General Aſſembly to nullify this part of our conſtitution (which we utterly deny) they have not done it. The right is ſtill guarded by all the ſolemnities of law, and therefore the honourable remonſtrants claim and demand its benefits. This they do, from your Honours, not as a Legiſlative, but as acting in a judicial capacity. For the paſſing of ſentence is the exerciſing a judiciary power, grounded upon a pre-exiſting law. You are bound then by that oath, to which you all ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted as a neceſſary qualification, previouſly to your becoming members; and which is in theſe words: "And you do farther engage equal right and juſtice to do to all perſons that ſhall appeal unto you for your judgment in their reſpective caſes."</p>
            <p>IT is perfectly immaterial upon the preſent argument, whether the judgment of the Court was right or wrong; whether it was
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:020825_0051_0FB0F928D64416A8"/>
agreeably to law, or againſt law. The only queſtion is, whether they can, in any reſpect, be brought to anſwer for it, <hi>but by due courſe of law?</hi> And conſequently, whether they can be paſſed upon and condemned, until they be proved guilty of a crime?</p>
            <p>THE tenure by which all commiſſions are held in this State, is for the ſpace of one year. Conſequently, during that term, every officer has an intereſt, a kind of eſtate, inſeparably annexed to his appointment. To be diveſted of which, he muſt either neglect, miſuſe, or abuſe his truſt, ſo as to work a forfeiture. This neglect, miſuſe, and abuſe, include queſtions of fact, which muſt appear, either by the confeſſion of the party, or by proof, before the forfeiture can be declared. But how can the facts appear to be true or falſe, without an impartial and candid exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination? And how can ſuch examination take place until the facts or charges are particularly ſtated, and the party accuſed have an opportunity of making defence, in ſuch way as he ſhall deem moſt beneficial to himſelf?—Suppoſe he ſhould deny the facts, he muſt certainly be preſumed innocent till the contrary appear. How ſhall the contrary appear, but by producing evidence, oral or written?—If oral, hath he not a right to croſs-examine the witneſſes, to diſqualify them, or produce others to diſprove their teſtimony, either by deſtroying their credibility, or proving ſome other proportion totally inconſiſtent with that aſſerted by them? —Or, if the evidence be written, hath he not a right to ſuggeſt and eſtabliſh alteration, diminution, or even forgery itſelf?—In ſhort, can there exiſt, in contemplation of law, the poſſibility of an accuſation, that cannot be controverted, and proved to be groundleſs?</p>
            <p>DID the Judges hold their commiſſions during the pleaſure of the General Aſſembly, then indeed they might be removed without the formalities of a trial. But, even in that caſe, the exerciſe of ſo high a prerogative, without ſome kind of ſuggeſtion and proof, would be deemed injurious and oppreſſive. In the preſent caſe, however, wherein the Judges cannot be moleſted, but by being called to anſwer for ſome crime, <hi>by due courſe of law,</hi> there is not even a ſuggeſtion that they have intentionally
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:020825_0052_0FB0F92C5537E668"/>
departed from the line of their duty. Then are they ſecured in their poſts, during the term of their appointment, in as ſacred a manner as the property of any individual is guarded againſt the encroachments of a rapacious neighbour.</p>
            <p>THEY ſtand upon the firm ground of rectitude and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. If any man hath any accuſation to exhibit, let him come forth:—Let him produce the liſt of his charges;—they are willing to meet him. But they will meet him only upon <hi>due and legal proceſs,</hi> and before a Court lawfully qualified to try them. Should no ſuch accuſation be made, what remains but that the Judges be immediately diſcharged from any farther attendance upon this Aſſembly?</p>
            <p>SHOULD they be impeached, I pledge myſelf to ſhew, that they cannot be tried by this Honourable Aſſembly. But if a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary ſentiment ſhould prevail, I muſt requeſt time, till the next ſeſſion, to be prepared with arguments and authorities, to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh a doctrine ſo important in its conſequences. Permit me, however, for the preſent, to obſerve,</p>
            <p>THAT in England the Judges are appointed by the King, as the Supreme Executive. Their commiſſions are <hi>during good behaviour</hi>; and therefore they are not triable by the King, but by the Parliament only, and <hi>upon impeachment.</hi> Were they to be tried by the King, who appoints them, their judgments might be influenced by his authority; and ſo the channels of juſtice would be corrupted. Beſides, the King is the party accuſing, and conſequently cannot be the Judge. For the very act of complaining, preſuppoſes an opinion that the party complained of is guilty. Hence it is that the Grand Jurors, who make pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment, are diſqualified ultimately to decide upon the fact.</p>
            <p>IN this State the Judges are appointed by both Houſes of Aſſembly, in a Grand Committee. In this reſpect, they reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the King; and therefore cannot try the Judges upon a cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal charge. In the preſent inſtance, both Houſes of Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly are the party complaining; in this reſpect alſo, they reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:020825_0053_0FB0F92DC0CA8B90"/>
the King, and ſo cannot be the triers. For, with deference to the Legiſlators preſent, there may be an Aſſembly, whoſe intereſted views might induce them to eſtabliſh ſyſtems totally ſubverſive of the conſtitution, and of political as well as civil liberty. To effect which, the Supreme Judiciary muſt be the creatures of their power; and ſuch creatures they would finally be, were the Judges to be appointed, accuſed, and tried by them.</p>
            <p>LET the human heart, and, as I have the honour of addreſſing myſelf to ſome who profeſs and even attempt to teach the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines of Chriſtianity, the conſcience alſo, be conſulted upon this queſtion!—Should not the parties litigant be equally indifferent to the Judge, who is to decide upon their controverſy?—Why is it that jurors may be challenged, and removed, for favour, but that the mind ſhould be perfectly unbiaſſed, and open to the reception of truth?—Why, like Caeſar's wife, ſhould they be incapable of being ſuſpected, unleſs that the parties themſelves might feel a perfect confidence in their Judges?—Can that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence be placed upon this occaſion?—Hath not the matter been taken up rather in a political than a juridical point of view?—I do not aſſert; but hath it not been determined, in a convention of part of the members, to remove the Judges, and appoint others who will execute, at all events, the penal acts?— Hath not one town in particular proceeded ſo far, as to inſtruct its Deputies to uſe their utmoſt influence in bringing the Judges to puniſhment?—Can theſe members be conſidered as impartial triers?—Is it poſſible to ſuppoſe, but that the influence of their conſtituents will have ſome weight in forming their opinion?— Can they be objected to, as having prejudged the cauſe?—If they cannot, is there not a moral certainty of condemnation? If they can, will not the objection be ſo far extended, as to prevent the poſſibility of a legal deciſion?—</p>
            <p>BE entreated therefore, O ye guardians and protectors of the people, ſeriouſly to reflect upon the magnitude of the preſent queſtion, and the important events that may reſult from your determination!—"The Great Judge of all the earth, can He do wrong?"—Of beings rational, <hi>He</hi> requires the <hi>"heart."</hi>—

And "as a man believeth in his <hi>conſcience,</hi> ſo is he!"—Submit then to the heavenly ſtandard! And, as the Judges have acquit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted themſelves <hi>conſcientiouſly,</hi> in the ſight of God and man, add to the general plaudit, which ſhall waft their names upon the wings of immortal fame, to the lateſt poſterity!</p>
            <p>THE claim and demand of the Judges, as ſtated in their me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morial, and enforced by their counſel, were followed by a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, but rational debate, in which the fury of paſſion, excepting in one or two inſtances, ſurrendered to cool reflection, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared the way for vindicating the honour of the law, and the dignity of the State. In vain did any endeavour to recall the mind to a predetermined reſolution! Truth, "which is lodged in a ſecret corner of the heart," exerted her gentle influence, while prejudice and malice retired abaſhed!</p>
            <p>A MOTION was made by an honourable member, ſeconded, and agreed to, that the opinion of the Attorney-General be taken, and the ſentiments of the other profeſſional gentlemen requeſted, whether conſtitutionally, and agreeably to law, the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly can ſuſpend, or remove from office, the Judges of the Supreme Judiciary Court, without a previous charge and ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of criminality, due proceſs, trial, and conviction thereon?</p>
            <p>MR. Channing, the Attorney-General, obſerved, that as it was at all times his duty, ſo he derived a peculiar pleaſure in rendering to the Hon. the Legiſlature every legal aſſiſtance in his power.—That he attended the trial upon the information, without any bias or partiality upon his mind; and was happy in the conviction, that the whole conduct of the Judges, upon that intereſting occaſion, demonſtrated the greateſt candour and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs; and, according to his private opinion, their determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation was conformable to the principles of conſtitutional law.— But, be their judgment agreeably to law or not, confident he was, that there would be a fatal interruption, if not annihilation to government, if they could be ſuſpended, or removed from office, for a mere matter of opinion, without a charge of crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality.—How that charge ſhould be preferred and conducted, he
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:020825_0055_0FB0F930C7515E08"/>
did not preſume to decide, as it might poſſibly be the ſubject matter of an after queſtion, and was not contained in the preſent order.—</p>
            <p>THE Honourable Mr. Bradford informed the Houſe, that he was not preſent at the trial in Newport, nor had he attended to the proceedings of the Legiſlature reſpecting the Judges, excepting ſo far as related to the citation, and the memorial upon the table: —That till then, he never doubted but the General Aſſembly were veſted with conſtitutional authority to try and remove any officer by them appointed, for any mal-practices in his office; but that from the obſervations that had been made, he very much doubted the propriety of his former opinion:—That one point, however, was clear and certain, that as the Judges were commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned and ſworn for the term of a year, they could not be deprived of their powers during that term, but by regular impeachment, in which the charges againſt them muſt be particularly ſtated; trial, in which they would have an undoubted right for time to prepare their defence, and to be heard by counſel; and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, upon full proofs of the charges:—That in the proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings now before the Houſe, there was not a charge, or the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of one, againſt the Court, to which they could, in any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, be held to anſwer:—That he was really aſtoniſhed, that ſo much time ſhould be taken up in needleſs enquiries, and fruitleſs altercations!—That he had been honoured with a ſeat, in one or other of the Houſes of the Aſſembly, for upwards of thirty years, and could not recollect a period, in which harmony and unanimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty were more eſſentially wanting than at the preſent time:—That the people of this State had been well governed; that they had been an happy people, and might ſtill be as happy as any on earth, if all party contentions could be laid aſide, and every one ſtrive to ſooth the cares, and heal the wounds, of his neighbours!—He beſought, he entre<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>d the members to embrace the preſent mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in which th<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> ſeemed to be a ſpirit of conciliation, to put an end to all further contentions among themſelves, but what might ariſe for the ſake of information!—And, as they regarded the honour, the peace, and the ſafety of the State, that they would diſcharge the Judges from any farther attendance, and apply
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:020825_0056_0FB0F932450F8458"/>
themſelves in earneſt, and with one mind, to ſuch meaſures as would render them happy at home, and reſpectable abroad.—</p>
            <p>MR. Helme remarked, that the ſubject was new, and he was not fully prepared to give an opinion.—But that, at preſent, he inclined to think, that there was no conſtitutional law by which the queſtion could be ſolved:—That therefore it muſt be in the breaſt of the General Aſſembly to point out the mode of trial by an act for that purpoſe, ſhould a trial be thought neceſſary:— That if they ſhould proceed to try the Judges, either by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, or a Court to be ſpecially appointed for that purpoſe, they muſt cauſe them firſt to be impeached, and ſtate the facts parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly upon which the impeachment is founded:—That the common law will direct in the manner of proceſs; and ſhould they be found guilty, they cannot be removed from their office but by a bill, in nature of a bill of attainder, which muſt paſs both Houſes, and be enacted into a law.</p>
            <p>MR. Goodwin ſpoke with elegance, and fully acquieſced in the opinions already given, that no ſentence could be paſſed againſt the Judges, but by regular proceſs, in which a ſpecification of the charges is eſſentially requiſite.—He was diffuſively elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, enlarged upon the ſubject, and concluded by obſerving, that he had given his ſentiments without reſerve, and had thought with freedom before he gave them.</p>
            <p>THE two profeſſional Gentlemen in the Houſe, the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Mr. Marchant, and Mr. Bourne, confirmed the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their brethren, in the leading points, by a maſterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play of legal talents.—</p>
            <p>THE only queſtion remaining was, whether the Judges ſhould be diſcharged from any further attendance upon the General Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, as no accuſation appeared againſt them?—The queſtion was put, and decided by a very great majority, "that as the Judges are not charged with any criminality in rendering the judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, upon the information, Trevett againſt Weeden, they are therefore diſcharged from any further attendance upon this Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, on that account."</p>
