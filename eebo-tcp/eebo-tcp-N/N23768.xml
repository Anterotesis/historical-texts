            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>ADVERTISEMENT.</head>
                  <p>RESPECTING the ſource from which the following letters have been drawn, and the grounds on which the reader is expected to reſt his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of their authenticity, it may be ſufficient to inform him (and, for the truth of the aſſertion, to appeal to His Excellency Thomas Pinckney, the Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can Miniſter Plenipotentiary) that permiſſion was obtained from the proper authority, to tranſcribe, from the original papers preſerved in the Secretary of State's office in Philadelphia, theſe and ſundry other authentic documents relating to the conteſt between the colonies and the mother country, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Letters from the Commanders of the continental forces, and other perſons em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the public ſervice,—intercepted letters from Britiſh Officers and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther adherents to the royal cauſe,—Communications from the Governors, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventions, and Committees of the ſeveral American States,—Diſpatches from Agents and Commiſſioners,—Inſtructions,—Reports of Committees of Congreſs,—parts of the Secret Journals hitherto unpubliſhed,—and various other pieces elucidative of the events which led to and finally eſtabliſhed American Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence.</p>
                  <p>That permiſſion was granted early in the year 1792, and immediate advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage was taken of the indulgence; though, from various circumſtances, of lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle conſequence to the reader to know, the publication has been ſo long delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Even at this late period, the editor contents himſelf with laying before the public but a part of the collection,—intending, if theſe volumes meet with a favorable reception, to continue the publication, and preſent his readers with a variety of intereſting pieces penned by the leaders and principal agents in the American Revolution, and tending to throw light on many important tranſactions that have hitherto been either enveloped in total darkneſs, or, at beſt but obſcurely perceived and imperfectly underſtood.</p>
                  <p>Some parts of theſe letters may perhaps appear too full of minutiae to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt that claſs of readers, who, unaccuſtomed to enter into the inveſtigation of cauſes or conſequences, delight only in recitals of battles, ſieges, or other ſtriking occurrences, which conſtitute the more prominent features of hiſtory. But to the reaſoning philoſophic reader, who wiſhes to explore the ſecret ſprings of action,—to trace events to their remote and latent cauſes,—to diſcover and examine the ſubordinate and collateral circumſtances (oft trifling in appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and generally overlooked by the vulgar eye) which, in the ſtruggles of contending nations, give a preponderancy to the one or the other ſcale,—thoſe minute details will, it is preſumed, be far from unacceptable, as furniſhing him with that ſpecies of information, upon which alone he can venture to ground a deciſive opinion, and which he might elſewhere ſeek in vain.</p>
                  <p>The incloſures, frequently referred to in theſe volumes, would ſtill further contribute to ſet every circumſtance in a clearer and ſtronger light; and it was the editor's original intention that they ſhould have accompanied the letters to which they reſpectively belong. Obſtacles however, <hi>at preſent</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurmountable, ſtand in the way of their immediate publication: but, when theſe are removed, the papers alluded to ſhall make their appearance in form of an Appendix,—ſuch parts of them at leaſt, as are of a curious and intereſting nature.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:031423_0003_0FEC4A5615F621A0"/>
Meanwhile the reader will obſerve that it was deemed as yet premature to publiſh certain paſſages of theſe letters: ſome omiſſions have of courſe taken place, which are every where pointed out by aſteriſks, and which will be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied at a proper ſeaſon, probably not far diſtant.—On the other hand, in per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps half a dozen inſtances, a ſingle word has been hazarded on conjecture, to fill up a chaſm, where either the original or the copy happened to be torn or defaced; in which caſes the ſupplemental words are incloſed within crotchets and printed in Italic.—A few entire letters, moreover, as appears by reference made to them in ſubſequent ones, are here wanted to complete the chain of correſpondence. Theſe the editor can give no account of, as the originals ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to have been loſt from the files of offi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  <p>THE rain on friday afternoon and ſaturday,—the advice of ſeveral gentlemen of the Jerſeys and this city, by no means to croſs Hudſon's river at the lower ferry,—and ſome other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances too trivial to mention, prevented my arrival at this place, until the afternoon of this day.</p>

Powder is ſo eſſential an article, that I cannot help again repeating the neceſſity of a ſupply. The camp at Boſton, from the beſt ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count I can get from thence, is but very poorly ſupplied. At this place, they have ſcarce any. How they are provided at general Wooſter's camp, I have not been able yet to learn.</p>
                  <p>Governor Tryon is arrived, and general Schuyler directed to adviſe you of the line of conduct he moves in. I fear it will not be very favorable to the American cauſe.</p>

                  <p>UPON my arrival hdere this afternoon, I was informed that an expreſs was in town, from the provincial camp in Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts-Bay; and having ſeen, among the papers in his poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, a letter directed to you as preſident of the Congreſs, I have taken the liberty to open it.

                  <p>You will find, ſir, by that letter, a great want of powder in the provincial army, which I ſincerely hope the Congreſs will ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply as ſpeedily and as effectually as in their power. One thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds in weight were ſent to the camp at Cambridge, three days ago, from this city; which has left this place almoſt deſtitute of that neceſſary article: there being at this time from the beſt information, not more than four barrels of powder in the city of New-York.</p>
                  <p>I propoſe to ſet off for the provincial camp to-morrow, and will uſe all poſſible diſpatch to join the forces there.</p>

                  <p>I ARRIVED ſafe at this place on the third inſtant, after a journey attended with a good deal of fatigue, and retarded by neceſſary attentions to the ſucceſſive civilities which accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied me on my whole route.</p>
                  <p>Upon my arrival, I immediately viſited the ſeveral poſts oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied by our troops; and, as ſoon as the weather permitted, reconnoitred thoſe of the enemy. I found the latter ſtrongly intrenched on Bunker's hill, about a mile from Charleſtown, and advanced about half a mile from the place of the late ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, with their centries extended about one hundred and fifty yards on this ſide of the narroweſt part of the neck leading
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031423_0006_0FEC4A105D103750"/>
from this place to Charleſtown. Three floating batteries lie in Myſtick river near their camp, and one twenty-gun ſhip below the ferry place between Boſton and Charleſtown. They have alſo a battery on Copſe-hill, on the Boſton ſide, which much annoyed our troops in the late attack. Upon the neck, they have alſo deeply intrenched and fortified. Their advanced guards, till laſt ſaturday morning, occupied Brown's houſes, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a mile from Roxbury meeting-houſe, and twenty rod<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> from their lines: but, at that time, a party from general Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas's camp ſurpriſed the guard, drove them in, and burned the houſes. The bulk of their army, commanded by general Howe, lies on Bunker's-hill, and the remainder on Roxbury-neck, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the light-horſe, and a few men in the town of Boſton.</p>
                  <p>On our ſide, we have thrown up intrenchments on Winter and Proſpect hills,—the enemy's camp in full view, at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of a little more than a mile. Such intermediate points as would admit a landing, I have ſince my arrival taken care to ſtrengthen, down to Sewal's farm, where a ſtrong intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has been thrown up. At Roxbury, general Thomas has thrown up a ſtrong work on the hill, about two hundred yards above the meeting-houſe; which, with the brokenneſs of the ground, and a great number of rocks, has made that paſs very ſecure. The troops raiſed in New-Hampſhire, with a regiment from Rhode-Iſland, occupy Winter-hill; a part of thoſe from Connecticut, under general Putnam, are on Proſpect-hill. The troops in this town are entirely of the Maſſachuſetts: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the Rhode-Iſland-men are at Sewal's farm. Two regiments of Connecticut, and nine of the Maſſachuſetts, are at Roxbury. The reſidue of the army, to the number of about ſeven hundred, are poſted in ſeveral ſmall towns along the coaſt, to prevent the depredations of the enemy.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, I think myſelf authoriſed to ſay, that, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the great extent of line and the nature of the ground, we are as well ſecured, as could be expected in ſo ſhort a time, and under the diſadvantages we labor. Theſe conſiſt in a want of engineers, to conſtruct proper works and direct the men, a wan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> of tools, and a ſufficient number of men to man the works in caſe of an attack. You will obſerve, by the proceedings of the council of war which I have the honor to incloſe, that it is our unanimous opinion to hold and defend theſe works as long as poſſible. The diſcouragement it would give the men, and its contrary effects on the miniſterial troops, thus to abandon our encampment in their face, formed with ſo much labor,—
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031423_0007_0FEC4B5542CD0698"/>
added to the certain deſtruction of a conſiderable and valuable extent of country, and our uncertainty of finding a place in all reſpects ſo capable of making a ſtand,—are leading reaſons for this determination. At the ſame time we are very ſenſible of the difficulties which attend the defence of lines of ſo great ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, and the dangers which may enſue from ſuch a diviſion of the army.</p>
                  <p>My earneſt wiſh to comply with the inſtructions of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, in making an early and complete return of the ſtate of the army, has led into an involuntary delay in addreſſing you; which has given me much concern. Having given orders for this purpoſe immediately on my arrival,—and unappriſed of the imperfect obedience which had been paid to thoſe of the like nature from general Ward, I was led from day to day to expect they would come in, and therefore detained the meſſenger.—They are not now ſo complete as I could wiſh: but much al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance is to be made for inexperience in forms, and a liberty which had been taken (not given) on this ſubject. Theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, I flatter myſelf, will no longer exiſt; and, of conſequence, more regularity and exactneſs will in future prevail. This, with a neceſſary attention to the lines, the movements of the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial troops, and our immediate ſecurity, muſt be my apology, which I beg you to lay before Congreſs with the utmoſt duty and reſpect.</p>
                  <p>We labor under great diſadvantages for want of tents; for, though they have been helped out by a collection of now uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſails from the ſea-port towns, the number is far ſhort of our neceſſities. The colleges and houſes of this town are neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily occupied by the troops; which affords another reaſon for keeping our preſent ſituation. But I moſt ſincerely wiſh the whole army was properly provided to take the field, as I am well aſſured that (beſides greater expedition and activity in caſe of alarm) it would highly conduce to health and diſcipline. As materials are not to be had here, I would beg leave to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend the procuring a farther ſupply from Philadelphia as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould be extremely deficient in gratitude as well as juſtice, if I did not take the firſt opportunity to acknowledge the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs and attention, which the provincial Congreſs and different committees have ſhewn, to make every thing as convenient and agreeable as poſſible. But there is a vital and inherent princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of delay, incompatible with military ſervice, in tranſacting buſineſs through ſuch numerous and different channels. I eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem it therefore my duty to repreſent the inconvenience which
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031423_0008_0FEC4A2E86D8A7B0"/>
muſt unavoidably enſue from a dependence on a number of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for ſupplies; and ſubmit it to the conſideration of Congreſs, whether the public ſervice will not be beſt promoted by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing a commiſſary-general for theſe purpoſes. We have a ſtriking inſtance of the preference of ſuch a mode, in the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of Connecticut, as their troops are extremely well pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided under the direction of Mr. Trumbull, and he has at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent times aſſiſted others with various articles. Should my ſentiments happily coincide with thoſe of your honors on this ſubject, I beg leave to recommend Mr. Trumbull as a very proper perſon for this department. In the arrangement of troops collected under ſuch circumſtances, and upon the ſpur of immediate neceſſity, ſeveral appointments are omitted, which appear to be indiſpenſably neceſſary for the good government of the army—particularly a quarter-maſter-general, a commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary of muſters, and a commiſſary of artillery. Theſe I muſt earneſtly recommend to the notice and proviſion of Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>I find myſelf already much embarraſſed, for want of a milita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry cheſt. Theſe embarraſſments will increaſe every day: I muſt therefore requeſt that money may be forwarded as ſoon as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. The want of this moſt neceſſary article will (I fear) pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce great inconveniencies, if not prevented by an early atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I find the army in general, and the troops raiſed in Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts in particular, very deficient in neceſſary clothing.—Upon enquiry, there appears no probability of obtaining any ſupplies in this quarter; and, on the beſt conſideration of this matter I am able to form, I am of opinion that a number of hunting ſhirts (not leſs than ten thouſand) would in a great de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree remove this difficulty, in the cheapeſt and quickeſt manner. I know nothing, in a ſpeculative view, more trivial, yet, if put in practice, would have a happier tendency to unite the men, and aboliſh thoſe provincial diſtinctions which lead to jealouſy and diſſatisfaction.</p>

                     </gap> part of this letter, I mentioned the want of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gineers. I can hardly expreſs the diſappointment I have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced on this ſubject,—the ſkill of thoſe we have being very imperfect, and confined to the mere manual exerciſe of cannon; whereas the war in which we are engaged requires a knowledge, comprehending the duties of the field, and fortification. If a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons thus qualified are to be found in the ſouthern colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, it would be of great public ſervice to forward them with all expedition.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="10" facs="unknown:031423_0009_0FEC4A38A7ECC3A0"/>
Upon the article of ammunition, I muſt re-echo my former complaints on this ſubject. We are ſo exceedingly deſtitute, that our artillery will be of little uſe, without a ſupply both large and ſeaſonable. What we have muſt be reſerved for the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arms, and that managed with the utmoſt frugality. * * *</p>
                  <p>The ſtate of the army you will find aſcertained with tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble preciſion in the returns which accompany this letter. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on finding the number of men to fall ſo far ſhort of the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment, and below all expectation, I immediately called a council of the general officers, whoſe opinion (as to the mode of filling up the regiments, and providing for the preſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>t exi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency) I have the honor of incloſing, together with the beſt judgment we are able to form of the miniſterial troops. From the number of boys, deſerters, and negroes, that have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſted in the troops of this province, I entertain ſome doubts whether the number required can be raiſed here: and all the general officers agree that no dependence can be put upon the militia, for a continuance in camp, or regularity and diſcipline during the ſhort time they may ſtay. This unhappy and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voted province has been ſo long in a ſtate of anarchy, and the yoke * * * * * been laid ſo heavily on it, that great allowances are to be made for troops raiſed under ſuch circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. The deficiency of numbers, diſcipline, and ſtores, can only lead to this concluſion—that their ſpirit has exceeded their ſtrength. But at the ſame time I would humbly ſubmit to the conſideration of Congreſs the propriety of making ſome further proviſion of men from the other colonies. If theſe regiments ſhould be completed to their eſtabliſhment, the diſmiſſion of thoſe unfit for duty on account of their age and character would occaſion a conſiderable reduction; and, at all events, they have been enliſted upon ſuch terms, that they may be diſband<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when other troops arrive. But ſhould my apprehenſions be realiſed, and the regiments here not filled up, the public cauſe would ſuffer by an abſolute dependence upon ſo doubtful an event, unleſs ſome proviſion is made againſt ſuch a diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>It requires no military ſkill, to judge of the difficulty of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troducing proper diſcipline and ſubordination into an army, while we have the enemy in view, and are in daily expectation of an attack: but it is of ſo much importance, that every ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort will be made, which time and circumſtances will admit. In the mean time, I have a ſincere pleaſure in obſerving that there are materials for a good army,—a great number of able-bodied
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031423_0010_0FEC4A3D90571718"/>
men, active, zealous in the cauſe, and of unqueſtionable courage.</p>
                  <p>I am now, ſir, to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the twenty-eighth, incloſing the reſolutions of Congreſs, of the twenty-ſeventh ultimo, and a copy of a letter from the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of Albany; to all which I ſhall pay due attention.</p>
                  <p>Generals Gates and Sullivan have both arrived in good health.</p>
                  <p>My beſt abilities are at all times devoted to the ſervice of my country; but I feel the weight, importance, and variety of my preſent duties too ſenſibly, not to wiſh a more immediate and frequent communication with the Congreſs. I fear it may often happen in the courſe of our preſent operations, that I ſhall need that aſſiſtance and direction from them, which time and diſtance will not allow me to receive.</p>
                  <p>Since writing the above, I have alſo to acknowledge your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of the fourth inſtant by Feſſenden, and the receipt of the commiſſions and articles of war. The former are yet eight hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred ſhort of the number required. This deficiency you will pleaſe to ſupply as ſoon as you conveniently can. Among the other returns, I have alſo ſent one of our killed, wounded, and miſſing, in the late action: but have been able to procure no certain account of the loſs of the miniſterial troops. My beſt intelligence fixes it at about five hundred killed, and ſix or ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven hundred wounded: but it is no more than conjecture,—the utmoſt pains being taken on their ſide to conceal it.</p>

                  <p>SINCE I did myſelf the honor of addreſſing you on the tenth inſtant, nothing material has happened in the camp. From ſome authentic and later advices of the ſtate of the miniſterial troops, and the great inconvenience of calling in the militia in the midſt of harveſt, I have been induced for the preſent to wave it:—but in the mean time recruiting parties have been ſent throughout this province, to fill up the regiments to the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtabliſhment of the provincial Congreſs. At the ſame time that I received theſe advices, I alſo obtained a liſt of the officers of the enemy killed and wounded in the late battle at Charleſtown, which I take this opportunity to incloſe.</p>
                  <p>The great ſcarcity of freſh proviſions in their army has led me to take every precaution to prevent a ſupply: for this pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, I have ordered all the cattle and ſheep to be drawn from the low grounds and farms within their reach. A detachment from general Thomas's camp, on wedneſday night, went over to Long-Iſland, and brought from thence twenty cattle and a number of ſheep, with about fifteen laborers who had been put on by a Mr. Ray Thomas, to cut the hay, &amp;c. By ſome acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent they omitted burning the hay, and returned the next day at noon to complete it; which they effected, amidſt the firing of the ſhipping, with the loſs of one man killed and another wounded.</p>
                  <p>Laſt evening alſo a party of the Connecticut men ſtrolled down on the marſh at Roxbury, and fired upon a centry; which drew on a heavy fire from the enemy's lines and floating batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but attended with no other effect than the loſs of one kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſhot from the enemy's lines. In the man time, we are, on both ſides, continuing our works: but there has been no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther movement than what I have noticed above. I ſhall endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to give a regular and particular account of all tranſactions as they occur, which you will pleaſe to lay before the honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Congreſs.

                  <p>SINCE I did myſelf the honor of addreſſing you the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth inſtant, I have received advice from governor Trumbull, that the aſſembly of Connecticut had voted, and that they are now raiſing, two regiments of ſeven hundred men each, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of an application from the provincial Congreſs of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts-Bay.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031423_0012_0FEC48AD2A93FE70"/>
The Rhode-Iſland aſſembly has alſo made an augmentation for this purpoſe. Theſe reinforcements, with the riflemen who are daily expected, and ſuch recruits as may come in to fill up the regiments here, will, I apprehend, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe an army ſufficiently ſtrong to oppoſe any force which may be brought againſt us at preſent. I am very ſenſible that the heavy expenſe, neceſſarily attendant upon this campaign, will call for the utmoſt frugality and care, and would therefore, if poſſible, avoid enliſting one unneceſſary man. As this is the firſt certain account of the deſtination of theſe new-raiſed troops, I thought proper to communicate my ſentiments as early as poſſible, leſt the Congreſs ſhould act upon my letter of the tenth, and raiſe troops in the ſouthern colonies, which, in my preſent judgment may be diſpenſed with.</p>
                  <p>For theſe eight days paſt there have been no movements in either camp, of any conſequence. On our ſide we have conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued the works without any intermiſſion; and they are now ſo far advanced as to leave us little to apprehend on that ſcore. On the ſide of the enemy they have alſo been very induſtrious in finiſhing their lines, both on Bunker's-hill and Roxbury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neck. In this interval alſo, their tranſports have arrived from New-York; and they have been employed in landing and ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning their men. I have been able to collect no certain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the numbers arrived: but the incloſed letter, wrote (though not ſigned) by Mr. Sheriff Lee, and delivered me by captain Darby (who went expreſs with an account of the Lex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington battle) will enable us to form a pretty accurate judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The increaſe of tents and men in the town of Boſton is very obvious; but all my accounts from thence agree that there is a great mortality, occaſioned by the want of vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and freſh meat; and that their loſs in the late battle at Charleſtown (from the few recoveries of their wounded) is greater than at firſt ſuppoſed. The condition of the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants detained in Boſton is very diſtreſſing: they are equally deſtitute of the comfort of freſh proviſions; and many of them are ſo reduced in their circumſtances, as to be unable to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply themſelves with ſalt. Such fiſh as the ſoldiery leave, is their principal ſupport. Added to all this, ſuch ſuſpicion and jealouſy prevails, that they can ſcarcely ſpeak, or even look, without expoſing themſelves to ſome ſpecies of military execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>I have not been able, from any intelligence I have received, to form any certain judgment of the future operations of the enemy. Sometimes I have ſuſpected an intention of detaching
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031423_0013_0FEC4787106B1448"/>
a part of their army to ſome part of the coaſt, as they have been building a number of flat-bottomed boats, capable of holding two hundred men each. But, from their works, and the language held at Boſton, there is reaſon to think they ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the attack from us, and are principally engaged in prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves againſt it. I have ordered all the whale-boats along the coaſt to be collected: and ſome of them are employed every night to watch the motions of the enemy by water, ſo as to guard as much as poſſible againſt any ſurpriſe. * * *</p>
                  <p>Next to the more immediate and preſſing duties of putting our lines in as ſecure a ſtate as poſſible, attending to the move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of the enemy, and gaining intelligence—my great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern is to eſtabliſh order, regularity, and diſcipline, without which, our numbers would embarraſs us, and, in caſe of action, general confuſion muſt infallibly enſue. In order to this, I propoſe to divide the army into three diviſions:—at the head of each, will be a general officer:—theſe diviſions to be again ſubdivided into brigades, under their reſpective brigadiers. But the difficulty ariſing from the arrangement of the general officers, and waiting the further proceedings of the Congreſs on this ſubject, has much retarded my progreſs in this moſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary work. I ſhould be very happy to receive their final com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, as any determination would enable me to proceed in my plan. * * *</p>
                  <p>In addition to the officers mentioned in mine of the tenth inſtant, I would humbly propoſe that ſome proviſion ſhould be made for a judge-advocate, and provoſt-marſhal. The neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the firſt appointment was ſo great, that I was obliged to nominate Mr. Tudor, who was well recommended to me, and now executes the office under the expectation of receiving cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's pay—an allowance (in my opinion) ſcarcely adequate to the ſervice, in new-raiſed troops, where there are court-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tials every day. However, as that is the proportion in the regular army, and he is contented, there will be no neceſſity of an addition.</p>
                  <p>I muſt alſo renew my requeſt as to money, and the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a paymaſter. I have forebore urging matters of this nature, from my knowledge of the many important concerns which engage the attention of the Congreſs; but as I find my difficulties thicken every day, I make no doubt, ſuitable regard will be paid to a neceſſity of this kind. The inconvenience of borrowing ſuch ſums as are conſtantly requiſite muſt be too plain for me to enlarge upon, and is a ſituation from which I ſhould be very happy to be relieved.</p>

Upon the experience I have had, and the beſt conſideration of the appointment of the ſeveral officers of commiſſary-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, muſter-maſter general, quarter maſter-general, pay maſter-general, and commiſſary of artillery, I am clearly of opinion that they not only conduce to order, diſpatch and diſcipline, but that it is a meaſure of oeconomy. The delay, the waſte, and unpuniſhable neglect of duty, ariſing from theſe officers being in commiſſion of ſeveral hands, evidently ſhow that the public expenſe muſt be finally enhanced. I have experienced the want of theſe officers, in completing the returns of men, ammunition, and ſtores. The latter are yet imperfect, from the number of hands in which they are diſperſed. I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed the laſt weekly return, which is more accurate than the former; and hope in a little time we ſhall be perfectly regular in this as well as ſeveral other neceſſary branches of duty.</p>
                  <p>I have made inquiry into the eſtabliſhment of the hoſpital, and find it in a very unſettled condition. There is no princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal director, nor any ſubordination among the ſurgeons: of conſequence, diſputes and contentions have ariſen, and muſt continue until it is reduced to ſome ſyſtem. I could wiſh it was immediately taken into conſideration, as the lives and health of both officers and men ſo much depend upon a due regulation of this department. I have been particularly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the leaſt ſymptoms of the ſmall-pox; and hitherto we have been ſo fortunate as to have every perſon removed ſo ſoon, as not only to prevent any communication, but any alarm or apprehenſion it might give in the camp. We ſhall continue the utmoſt vigilance againſt this moſt dangerous enemy.</p>
                  <p>In an army properly organiſed, there are ſundry offices of an inferior kind, ſuch as waggon-maſter, maſter carpenter, &amp;c. but I doubt whether my powers are ſufficiently extenſive for ſuch appointments. If it is thought proper to repoſe ſuch a truſt in me, I ſhall be governed, in the diſcharge of it, by a ſtrict regard to oeconomy and the public intereſt.</p>
                  <p>My inſtructions from the honorable Congreſs direct that no troops are to be diſbanded without their expreſs direction, nor to be recruited to more than double the number of the enemy. Upon this ſubject I beg leave to repreſent, that unleſs the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments in this province are more ſucceſsful in recruiting than I have reaſon to expect, a reduction of ſome of them will be highly neceſſary, as the public is put to the whole expenſe of an eſtabliſhment of officers, while the real ſtrength of the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment (which conſiſts in the rank and file) is defective. In caſe of ſuch a reduction, doubtleſs ſome of the privates and all the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031423_0015_0FEC4A5843CD34A0"/>
officers would return home: but many of the former would go into the remaining regiments; and, having had ſome experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, would fill them up with uſeful men. I ſo plainly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the expenſe of this campaign will exceed any calculation hitherto made, that I am particularly anxious to ſtrike off eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry unneceſſary charge. You will therefore, Sir, be pleaſed to favor me with explicit directions from the Congreſs, on the mode of this reduction (if it ſhall appear neceſſary) that no time may be loſt when ſuch neceſſity appears.</p>
                  <p>Yeſterday we had an account that the light-houſe was on fire:—by whom, and under what orders, I have not yet learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but we have reaſon to believe it has been done by our ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regulars.</p>
                  <p>You will pleaſe to preſent me to the Congreſs, with the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt duty and reſpect; and believe me to be, &amp;c.</p>

expreſs: but on tueſday three men-of-war and nine tranſports ſailed out of Boſton harbor, and ſtood a courſe about E. S. E.</p>
                  <p>One Groves, who came out of Boſton the ſame evening in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed the officer at one of the outpoſts, that the tranſports had on board ſix hundred men, and were bound to Block-Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Fiſher's-Iſland, and Long-Iſland, to plunder them, and bring off what cattle they may find. The fellow returned a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain into Boſton under ſuch ſuſpicious circumſtances, that it has led me to doubt the truth of his intelligence.</p>
                  <p>A deſerter, who came in afterwards, informs me that it was given out in their camp, that they were either gone for Indians or freſh proviſions: and that each tranſport had but twenty men on board. Upon this intelligence, I immediately wrote to governor Cooke of Rhode-Iſland, and to general Wooſter, that they might take proper precautions for removing the cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle off thoſe iſlands and the coaſts, and to prevent any ſurpriſe. As we are confirmed, by every account, in the ſcarcity of freſh proviſions in the enemy's camp, and particularly by this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerter it is very probable this voyage may be only intended for a ſupply: but as it may poſſibly be otherwiſe, I thought it beſt to tranſmit the intelligence to the honorable Congreſs, that they may forward it to the ſouthward, or take ſuch other ſteps as they may judge proper.</p>
                  <p>Since writing the above, three more deſerters have come out—which makes four in twenty-four hours. Their accounts correſpond with thoſe of the firſt who came out, and which I have related above.—I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>I AM to acknowledge the receipt of your favor of the twenty-fourth July, accompanied by two hundred and eighty four commiſſions, which are yet much ſhort of the neceſſary number. I am much honored by the confidence repoſed in me, of appointing the ſeveral officers recommended in mine of the tenth ultimo; and ſhall endeavor to ſelect ſuch perſons as are beſt qualified to fill theſe important poſts. * * * *</p>
                  <p>In the renewal of theſe commiſſions, ſome difficulties occur, in which I ſhould be glad to know the pleaſure of the honora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Congreſs. The general officers of the Maſſachuſetts have regiments; thoſe of Connecticut have both regiments and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies; and the other field officers have companies each. From Rhode-Iſland, the general officer has no regiment, but the field
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031423_0017_0FEC48A962E814B8"/>
officers have companies: but I do not find that they have o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> expect pay, under more than one commiſſion. Should the commiſſions, now to be delivered, purſue theſe different eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhments, there will be a diſtinction between general and field officers of the ſame rank. In order to put New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, Maſſachuſetts, and Rhode-Iſland, upon a line with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, it would be neceſſary to diſmiſs a number of officers in poſſeſſion of commiſſions, without any fault of theirs. On the other hand, to bring the Connecticut generals and field offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers to the ſame ſcale with the others, will add to the number of officers, and may be deemed inconſiſtent with the terms on which they entered into the ſervice, although you add nothing to the expenſe, except in the article of proviſions. Upon the whole, it is a caſe which I would wiſh the honorable Congreſs to conſider and determine.</p>
                  <p>Colonel Gridley of this province, who is at the head of the artillery, has the rank of major-general from the provincial Congreſs. Will it be proper to renew his commiſſion here in the ſame manner?—It is proper here to remark, that, in this caſe, he will take rank of all the brigadiers-general, and even the majors-general, whoſe commiſſions are ſubſequent in date: and this can anſwer no good purpoſe, but may be productive of many bad conſequences.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are matters of ſome importance: but I am embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a difficulty of a ſuperior kind. The eſtimate, made in Congreſs, ſuppoſed all the regiments to be formed upon one eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhment; but they are different in different provinces, and even vary in the ſame province, in ſome particulars: In Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts, ſome regiments have ten companies, others eleven: the eſtabliſhment of the former is five hundred and ninety men, of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers included;—of the latter ſix hundred and forty-nine. The eſtabliſhment of Rhode-Iſland and New Hampſhire is five hundred and ninety to a regiment, officers included:—Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut has a thouſand men to a regiment. Should the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts regiments be completed, with the new levies from Rhode-Iſland and Connecticut, and the riflemen, the number will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed twenty-two thouſand. If they ſhould not be completed,—as each regiment is fully officered, there will be a heavy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe to the public, without an adequate ſervice. The reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ſome of them ſeems to be neceſſary, and yet is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of much delicacy, as we are ſituated. I moſt earneſtly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt it may be taken into immediate conſideration, and the time and mode of doing it pointed out by the honorable Congreſs. By an eſtimate I have made from the general return,—when
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031423_0018_0FEC4A2827A97528"/>
the new levies arrive, and the regiments are completed, there will be twenty-four thouſand four hundred and fifty men on the pay and proviſion of the United Colonies. Some of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting officers, who have been out on that ſervice, have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned with very little ſucceſs; ſo that we may ſafely conclude, the number of two thouſand and ſixty-four, now wanting to complete, will rather increaſe than diminiſh. There are the regiments of artillery, conſiſting of four hundred and ninety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>three men, and one under colonel Sergeant (who has not receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed any commiſſion, although he had orders to raiſe a regiment, from the provincial Congreſs here) which are not included in the above eſtimate. This laſt regiment conſiſts of two hundred and thirty-four men by the laſt return; but a company has ſince joined.</p>
                  <p>By adverting to the reneral return, which I have the honor of incloſing (No. 1), it will be ſeen, what regiments are moſt deficient.</p>
                  <p>If the Congreſs does not chuſe to point out the particular re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, but the provinces in wich the reduction is to be made, the ſeveral Congreſſes and Aſſemblies may be the proper chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel to conduct this buſineſs, which I would alſo conceive the moſt adviſable, from their better acquaintance with the merits, terms, and time of ſervice, of the reſpective officers. Reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome regiments, and, with the privates thereof, filling up others, would certainly be the beſt method of accompliſhing this work if it were practicable: but the experiment is danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, as the Maſſachuſetts-men, under the privilege of chuſing their own officers, do not conceive themſelves bound, if thoſe officers are diſbanded.</p>
                  <p>As general Gage is making preparations for winter by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting for quantities of coal, it will ſuggeſt to us the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of extending our views to that ſeaſon. I have directed that ſuch huts as have been lately made of boards ſhould be done in ſuch a manner, that, if neceſſary, they may ſerve for cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing during the winter. But I need not enlarge upon the va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of neceſſities, ſuch as clothing, fuel, &amp;c. (both exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly ſcarce, and difficult to be procured) which that ſeaſon muſt bring with it, if the army or any conſiderable part of it is to remain embodied.</p>
                  <p>From the inactivity of the enemy ſince the arrival of their whole reinforcement,—their continual addition to their lines,—and many other circumſtances,—I am inclined to think, that finding us ſo well prepared to receive them, the plan of opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions is varied, and they mean, by regular approaches, to bom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bard

If they have not ſome ſuch expectations, the iſſue of which they are determined to wait, I cannot account for the delay, when their ſtrength is leſſened every day by ſickneſs, deſertions, and little ſkirmiſhes.</p>
                  <p>Of theſe laſt we have had only two worthy of notice. Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome reaſon to ſuſpect they were extending their lines at Charleſtown, I, laſt ſaturday evening, ordered ſome of the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flemen down, to make a diſcovery, or bring off a priſoner. They were accidentally diſcovered ſooner than they expected, by the guard coming to relieve, and obliged to fire upon them. We have reaſon to believe they killed ſeveral. They brought in two priſoners, whoſe account (confirmed by ſome other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances) removed my ſuſpicions in part. Since that time, we have, on each ſide, drawn in our centries, and there have been ſcattering fires along the line. This evening we have heard of three captains who have been taken off by the rifle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and one killed by a cannot-ſhot from Roxbury, beſides ſeveral privates: but as the intelligence is not direct, I only mention it as a report which deſerves credit. The other hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened at the light-houſe. A number of workmen having been ſent down to repair it, with a guard of twenty-two marines and a ſubaltern,—major Tupper, laſt monday morning about two o'clock, landed there with about three hundred men, attacked them, killed the officer and four privates: but being detained by the tide, in his return he was attacked by ſeveral boats; but he happily got through, with the loſs of one man killed, and another wounded. The remainder of the miniſterial troops (three of whom are badly wounded) he brought off priſoners, with ten tories, all of whom are on their way to Springfield-jail. The riflemen, in theſe ſkirmiſhes, loſt one man, who (we hear) is a priſoner in Boſton-jail. The enemy, in return, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to ſurpriſe our guard at Roxbury: but they, being appriſed of it by a deſerter, had time to prepare for it: but by ſome negligence or miſconduct in the officer of the guard, they burned the George tavern on the neck; and have every day ſince been cannonading us, from their lines, both at Roxbury and Charleſtown, but with no other effect than the loſs of two men. On our part, except ſtraggling fires from the ſmall arms about the lines, which we endeavor to reſtrain, we have made little or no return.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="21" facs="unknown:031423_0020_0FEC4A263A55E620"/>
Our ſituation, in the article of powder, is much more alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than I had the moſt diſtant idea of. Having deſired a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to be made out (on my arrival) of the ammunition, I found three hundred and three barrels and a half of powder mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as in the ſtore: but on ordering a new ſupply of cartridges yeſterday, I was informed, to my very great aſtoniſhment, that there was no more than thirty-ſix barrels of the Maſſachuſetts ſtore, which, with the ſtock of Rhode-Iſland, New-Hampſhire, and Connecticut, makes nine thouſand nine hundred and thirty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeven pounds,—not more than nine <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ounds a man. As there had been no conſumption of powder ſince, that could in any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree account for ſuch a deficiency, I was very particular in my inquiries, and found that the committee of ſupplies, not being ſufficiently acquainted with the nature of a return, or miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hending my requeſt, ſent in an account of all the ammunition which had been collected by the province: ſo that the report included not only what was in hand, but what had been ſpent.</p>
                  <p>Upon diſcovering this miſtake, I immediately went up to confer with the ſpeaker of the houſe of repreſentatives, upon ſome meaſures to obtain a ſupply from the neighbouring town<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, in ſuch a manner as might prevent our poverty being known; as it is a ſecret of too great conſequence to be divulg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the general court, ſome individual of which might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps indiſcreetly ſuffer it to eſcape him, ſo as to find its way to the enemy,—the conſequences of which are terrible even in idea. I ſhall alſo write to the governors of Rhode-Iſland and Connecticut, and the committee of ſafety in New-Hampſhire, on this ſubject, urging, in the moſt forcible terms, the neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of an immediate ſupply, if in their power. I need not en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>large on our melancholy ſituation: it is ſufficient that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of the army and the ſalvation of the country depends upon ſomething being done for our relief, both ſpeedy and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual, and that our ſituation be kept a profound ſecret.</p>
                  <p>In the incloſures, No. 2 and 3, I ſend the allowance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, &amp;c. made by the provinces of Connecticut and Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts. The mode and quantity are different from what has fallen within my experience; and, I am confident, muſt prove very waſteful and expenſive. If any alteration can be ſafely made, (which, I much doubt) there might be a great ſaving to the public.</p>
                  <p>A gentlemen of my family, aſſiſted by a deſerter who has ſome ſkill in fortification, has by my direction ſketched out two draughts of our reſpective lines at Charleſtown and Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031423_0021_0FEC4A1E0844E9B0"/>
which, with the explanations, will convey ſome idea of our ſituation, and, I hope, prove acceptable to the members of the honorable Congreſs. They are the incloſures, No. 4 and 5.</p>
                  <p>Since I had the honor of addreſſing you laſt, I have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to, by a committee of the general court, for a detachment of the army, to protect the inhabitants of the eaſtern parts of this province from ſome apprehended depredations on their coaſts. I could have wiſhed to have complied with their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt: but, after due conſideration, and conſulting the general officers, together with the members of Congreſs who are here, I thought it my duty to excuſe myſelf. The application and my anſwer are the incloſures, No. 6 and 7, which I hope will be approved by the honorable Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>Since I began this letter, the original, of which the inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, No. 8, is a copy, fell into my hands. As the writer is a perſon of ſome note in Boſton, and it contains ſome advices of importance not mentioned by others, I thought proper to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward it as I received it. By comparing the hand-writing with another letter, it appears the writer is one Belcher Noyes, a perſon probably known to ſome of the gentlemen, delegates from this province, who can determine from his principles and character, what credit is due-to him.</p>
                  <p>The army is now formed into three grand diviſions, under the command of the generals Ward, Lee, and Putnam:—each diviſion into two brigades, conſiſting of about ſix regiments each, commanded by generals Thomas and Spencer at Roxbury,—Heath at Cambridge,—Sullivan and Greene at Winter-hill. By this, you will pleaſe to obſerve, there is a deficiency of one brigadier-general, (occaſioned by Mr. Pomroy's not acting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his commiſſion) which I beg may be filled as ſoon as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. I obſerve the honorable Congreſs have alſo favored me with the appointment of three brigade-majors. I preſume they have or intend to appoint the reſt ſoon, as they cannot be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted that one is neceſſary to each brigade; and, in a new raiſed army it will be an office of great duty and ſervice.</p>
                  <p>General Gage has at length liberated the people of Boſton, who land in numbers at Chelſea every day. The terms on which the paſſes are granted, as to money, effects, and proviſions, cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond with Mr. Noyes' letter.</p>
                  <p>We have ſeveral reports that general Gage is diſmantling Caſtle-William, and bringing all the cannon up to town: but,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031423_0022_0FEC4A18CDA915E8"/>
upon a very particular enquiry, accounts are ſo various, that I cannot aſcertain the truth of it. * * * *</p>
                  <p>On the firſt inſtant, a chief of the Caghnawaga tribe, who lives about ſix miles from Montreal, came in here, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by a colonel Bayley of Cahoſs. His accounts of the tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and diſpoſition of the Indians are very favourable. He ſays they have been ſtrongly ſolicited by governor Carleton to engage againſt us; but his nation is totally averſe;—that threats, as well as entreaties, have been uſed without effect;—that the Canadians are well-diſpoſed to the Engliſh colonies: and if any expedition is meditated againſt Canada, the Indians in that quarter will give all their aſſiſtance. I have endeavored to cheriſh theſe favorable diſpoſitions, and have recommended to him to cultivate them on his return. What I have ſaid, I enforced with a preſent, which I underſtood would be agreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to him; as he is repreſented to be a man of weight and conſequence in his own tribe, I flatter myſelf his viſit will have a good effect. His account of general Carleton's force and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation at St. John's correſpond with what we have already had from that quarter.</p>
                  <p>The acceſſion of Georgia to the meaſures of the Congreſs is a happy event, and muſt give a ſincere pleaſure to every friend of America.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Auguſt</hi> 5.—We have accounts this morning of two explo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions at the caſtle; ſo that its deſtruction may now be ſuppoſed certain.</p>
                  <p>I have this morning been alarmed with an information that two gentlemen from Philadelphia (Mr. Hitchbour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> and captain White), with letters for general Lee and myſelf, have been taken by captain Ayſcough at Rhode-Iſland, the letters in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercepted and ſent forward to Boſton,—with the bearers, as priſoners; that the captain exulted much in the diſcoveries he had made: and my informer (who was alſo in the boat, but releaſed) underſtood them to the letters of conſequence. I have therefore diſpatched the expreſs immediately back, though I had before reſolved to detain him till Feſſenden's return. I ſhall be anxious till I am relieved from the ſuſpenſe I am in, as to the contents of thoſe letters.</p>
                  <p>It is exceedingly unfortunate that gentlemen ſhould chuſe to travel the only road on which there is danger. Let the event of this be what it will, I hope it it will ſerve as a general cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion againſt truſting any letters that way in future.</p>
                  <p>Nothing of conſequence has occurred in camp theſe two days.—The inhabitants of Boſton continue coming out at

                  <p>THE incloſed letter came under ſuch a direction and cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, as led me to ſuppoſe it contained ſome intereſting advices, either reſpecting a ſupply of powder, or the clothing lately taken at Philadelphia. I therefore took the liberty of breaking the ſeal, for which I hope the ſervice and my motives will apologize.</p>
                  <p>As the filling up the place of vacant brigadier-general will probably be the firſt buſineſs of the honorable Congreſs, I flatter myſelf it will not be deemed aſſuming, to mention, the names of two gentlemen whoſe former ſervices, rank and age, may be thought worthy of attention on this occaſion. The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is colonel John Armſtrong, of Pennſylvania: he ſerved du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the laſt war, in moſt of the campaigns to the ſouthward; was honored with the command of the Pennſylvania forces, and his general military conduct and ſpirit much approved by all who ſerved with him: beſides which, his character was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed by an enterpriſe againſt the Indians, which he plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned with great judgment, and executed with equal courage and ſucceſs. It was not till lately that I had reaſon to believe he would enter again on public ſervice; and it is now wholly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolicited and unknown on his part. The other gentlemen is co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Fry, of Maſſachuſetts-Bay. He entered into the ſervice as early as 1745, and roſe through the different military ranks, in the ſucceeding wars, to that of colonel, until laſt June, when he was appointed major-general by the Congreſs of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince. From theſe circumſtances, together with the favorable report made to me of him, I preſume he ſuſtained the character of a good officer, though I do not find it diſtinguiſhed by any peculiar ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Either of theſe gentlemen, or any other whom the honorable Congreſs will pleaſe to favor with this appointment, will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived by me with the utmoſt deference and reſpect.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="25" facs="unknown:031423_0024_0FEC4A169A195DB0"/>
The late adjournment having made it impracticable to know the pleaſure of the Congreſs as to the appointment of brigade-majors, beyond the number of three which they were pleaſed to leave me,—and the ſervice not admitting of farther delay, I have continued the other three; which I hope their honors will not diſapprove. Theſe latter were recommended by the reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive corps to which they belong, as the propereſt perſons for theſe offices, until farther direction, and have diſcharged the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ever ſince. They are the majors, Box, Scammel, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muel Brewer.</p>
                  <p>Laſt ſaturday night we took poſſeſſion of a hill cnoſiderably advanced beyond our former lines; which brought on a very heavy cannonade from Bunker's-hill, and afterwards a bombard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which has been ſince kept up with little ſpirit on their part, or damage on ours. The work having been continued ever ſince, is now ſo advanced, and the men ſo well covered, as to leave us under no apprehenſions of much farther loſs. In this affair, we had killed—one adjutant, one volunteer, and two privates. The ſcarcity of ammunition does not admit of our availing ourſelves of the ſituation, as we otherwiſe might do: but this evil, I hope, will ſoon be remedied, as I have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the arrival of a large quantity at New-York, ſome at New-London, and more hourly expected at different places. I need not add to what I have already ſaid on this ſubject.—Our late ſupply was very ſeaſonable, but far ſhort of our neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities.</p>
                  <p>The late adjournment of the honorable Congreſs having been made before my letter of the fourth inſtant was received, I muſt now beg leave to recal their attention to thoſe parts of it which reſpect the proviſion for the winter, the reduction of the troops, the double commiſſions under different eſtabliſhments, and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Gridley's appointment of major-general; in all which, I hope to be honored with their commands as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>The advocate-general has ſent me a memorial reſpecting his ſervice, which I have the honor to incloſe, (No. 1.) and from the variety and multiplicity of duty in a new army, as well as his regular ſervice and attendance, I am induced to recommend him to the farther notice of the honorable Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>The treatment of our officers, priſoners at Boſton, induced me to write to general Gage on that ſubject. His anſwer and my reply I have the honor to lay before the Congreſs, in the incloſures No. 2, 3, 4; ſince which I have heard nothing from him.</p>

                  <p>* * * MR. Livingſton and ſome other gentleman from your city brought us the acceptable news of the ſafe arrival of a large quantity of powder, and five hundred ſtand of arms. Our ſituation is ſuch as requires your immediate aſſiſtance and ſupply in that article. We have lately taken poſſeſſion of a hill conſiderably advanced towards the enemy; but our poverty prevents our availing ourſelves of any advantage of ſituation. I muſt therefore moſt earneſtly entreat that meaſures may be taken to forward to this camp, in the moſt ſafe and expeditious manner, whatever ammunition can be ſpared from the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and neceſſary defence of the province. The value of what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be ſent in conſequence of this requeſt, will be paid by order from hence when delivered, or negotiated with the honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able continental Congreſs at Philadelphia, as may be agreed with the proprietors. I only requeſt that no time may be loſt through any ſuch difficulties, as our ſituation is ſo critical, and the exigence ſo great. The mode of conveyance I muſt leave with the provincial Congreſs, or the committee of the city. I doubt not they will take every precaution to make it ſafe and expeditious.</p>

I deſired him to commit to writing ſuch propoſals as his experience and knowledge of the country might entitle him to make; which he has done in the paper which I have the honor to incloſe. The difficulty of procuring a ſufficient quantity of ſalt, which I had objected to him, he has fully obviated, by aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuring me that there is ſo much now actually in ſtore, in this and the neighboring towns, as will remove all poſſibility of a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment.</p>
                  <p>I propoſe to do myſelf the honor of writing, in a few days, fully and particularly on ſeveral heads, to which I muſt now refer. In the mean time, I have only to inform the honorable Congreſs, that I have received a ſmall ſupply of ſeven thouſand

pounds of powder this week from Rhode-Iſland, and in a few days expect ſeven tons of lead, and five hundred ſtand of arms, a part of the ſame importation; and to requeſt that more mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney may be forwarded with all expedition, the military cheſt being nearly exhauſted.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE been in daily expectation of being favored with the commands of the honorable Congreſs, on the ſubject of my two laſt letters. The ſeaſon now advances ſo faſt, that I cannot any longer defer laying before them ſuch farther mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures as require their immediate attention, and in which I wait their direction,</p>
                  <p>The mode in which the preſent army has been collected has occaſioned ſome difficulty in procuring the ſubſcription of both officers and ſoldiers to the continental articles of war. Their principal objection has been, that it might ſubject them to long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſervice than that for which they engaged under their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral provincial eſtabliſhments. It is in vain to attemt to rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon away the prejudices of a whole army: * * * I have therefore forbore preſſing them, as I did not experience any ſuch inconvenience from their adherence to their former rules, as would warrant the riſk of entering into a conteſt upon it; more eſpecially as the reſtraints, neceſſary for the eſtabliſhment of eſſential diſcipline and ſubordination, indiſpoſed their minds to every change, and made it both duty and policy to intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce as little novelty as poſſible.—With the preſent army, I fear ſuch a ſubſcription is impracticable: but the difficulty will ceaſe with this army.</p>
                  <p>The Connecticut and Rhode-Iſland troops ſtand engaged to the firſt of December only; and none longer than the firſt of January. A diſſolution of the preſent army therefore will take place, unleſs ſome early proviſion is made againſt ſuch an event. Moſt of the general officers are of opinion the greater part of them may be re-enliſted for the winter, or another cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, with the indulgence of a furlough to viſit their friends, which may be regulated ſo as not to endanger the ſervice. How far it may be proper to form the new army entirely out of the old, for another campaign, rather than from the contin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents of the ſeveral provinces, is a queſtion which involves in it too many conſiderations of policy and prudence, for me to
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:031423_0027_0FEC47821FFD4520"/>
undertake to decide. It appears to be impoſſible to draw it from any other ſource than the old army, for this winter: and, as the pay is ample, I hope a ſufficient number will engage in the ſervice for that time at leaſt. But there are various opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the temper of the men on the ſubject; and there may be great hazard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n deferring the trial ſo long.</p>
                  <p>In the continental eſtabliſhment, no proviſion has been made for the pay of artificers, diſtinct from that of the common ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers; whereas, under the provincial, ſuch as found their own tools, were allowed one ſhilling per diem advance, and particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar artizans, more. The pay of the artillery alſo now differs from that of the province: the men have leſs, the officers more; and, for ſome ranks, no proviſion is made, as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs will pleaſe to obſerve by the liſt which I have the honor to incloſe (No. 1). Theſe particulars, though ſeemingly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable, are the ſource of much complaint and diſſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which I endeavor to compoſe in the beſt manner I am able.</p>
                  <p>By the return of the rifle companies, and that battalion, they appear to exceed their eſtabliſhment very conſiderably. I doubt my authority to pay theſe extra men without the directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Congreſs: but it would be deemed a great hardſhip, wholly to refuſe them, as they have been encouraged to come.</p>
                  <p>The neceſſities of the troops having required pay, I directed that thoſe of the Maſſachuſetts ſhould receive for one month upon their being muſtered, and returning a proper roll: but a claim was immediately made for pay by lunar months; and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral regiments have declined taking up their warrants on this account. As this practice was entirely new to me, though ſaid to be warranted by former uſage, here the matter now waits the determination of the honorable Congreſs. I find, in Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut and Rhode-Iſland, this point was ſettled by calendar months; in Maſſachuſetts, though mentioned in Congreſs, it was left undetermined; which is alſo the caſe of New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire.</p>
                  <p>The incloſure No. 2, is a petition from the ſubalterns, reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their pay. Where there are only two of theſe in a compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, I have conſidered one as an enſign, and ordered him pay as ſuch, as in the Connecticut forces. I muſt beg leave to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend this petition to the favor of the Congreſs: as I am of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion the allowance is inadequate to their rank and ſervice, and is one great ſource, of that familiarity between the officers and men, which is ſo compatible with ſubordination and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline. Many valuable officers of thoſe ranks, finding themſelves
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:031423_0028_0FEC489EB3599588"/>
unable to ſupport the character and appearance of officers (I am informed) will retire as ſoon as the term of ſervice is expired, if there is no alteration.</p>
                  <p>For the better regulation of duty, I found it neceſſary to ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle the rank of the officers, and to number the regiments; and, as I had not received the command of the Congreſs on the ſubject, and the exigence of the ſervice forbade any further de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay, the general officers were conſidered as having no regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,—an alteration, which, I underſtand, is not pleaſing to ſome of them, but appeared to me and others to be proper, when it was conſidered, that, by this means, the whole army is put upon one footing, and all particular attachments diſſolved.</p>
                  <p>Among many other conſiderations which the approach of winter will demand, that of clothing appears to be one of the moſt important. So far as regards the preſervation of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from cold, they may be deemed in a ſtate of nakedneſs. Many of the men have been without blankets the whole cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign: and thoſe which have been in uſe during the ſummer, are ſo much worn as to be of little ſervice. In order to make a ſuitable proviſion in theſe articles, and at the ſame time to guard the public againſt impoſition and expenſe, it ſeems neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to determine the mode of continuing the army: for, ſhould theſe troops be clothed under their preſent engagement, and at the expiration of the term of ſervice, decline renewing it, a ſet of unprovided men may be ſent to ſupply their places.</p>
                  <p>I cannot ſuppoſe it to be unknown to the honorable Congreſs that, in all armies, it is an eſtabliſhed practice to make an al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance to officers, of proviſions and forage, proportionnte to their rank. As ſuch an allowance formed no part of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental eſtabliſhment, I have hitherto forbore to iſſue the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders for that purpoſe: but, as it is a received opinion of ſuch members of the Congreſs as I have had an opportunity of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting, as well as throughout the army, that it muſt be deem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a matter of courſe, and implied in the eſtabliſhment of the army, I have directed the following proportion of rations, being the ſame allowed in the American armies laſt war:—major-general, fifteen; brigadier-general, twelve; colonel, ſix; lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-colonel, five; major, four; captain, three; ſubaltern, two; ſtaff, two.</p>
                  <p>If theſe ſhould not be approved by the honorable Congreſs, they will pleaſe to ſignify their pleaſure, as to the alterations they would have made in the whole or in part.</p>
                  <p>I am now to inform the honorable Congreſs, that, encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the repeated declarations of the Canadians and Indians,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:031423_0029_0FEC47F91612C990"/>
and urged by their requeſts, I have detached colonel Arnold with a thouſand men, to penetrate into Canada by way of Ken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nebeck river, and, if poſſible to make himſelf maſter of Quebec. By this manoeuvre, I propoſed either to divert Carleton from St. John's, which would leave a free paſſage to general Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler;—or, if this did not take effect, Quebec, in its preſent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenceleſs ſtate, muſt fall into his hands an eaſy prey. I made all poſſible enquiry, as to the diſtance, the ſafety of the route, and the danger of the ſeaſon being too far advanced; but found no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in either, to deter me from proceeding, more eſpecially as it met with very general approbation from all whom I conſulted upon it. But, that nothing might be omitted, to enable me to judge of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> propriety and probable conſequences, I communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated it by expreſs to general Schuyler, who approved of it in ſuch terms, that I reſolved to put it in immediate execution. They have now left this place ſeven days; and, if favored with a good wind, I hope ſoon to hear of their being ſafe at Kenne-beck river. For the ſatisfaction of the Congreſs, I here incloſe a copy of the propoſed route (No. 3). I alſo do myſelf the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of incloſing a manifeſto, which I cauſed to be printed here, and of which colonel Arnold has taken a ſuitable number with him. This is the incloſure, No. 4. I have alſo forwarded a copy of his inſtructions (No. 5):—from all which, I hope the Congreſs will have a clear view of the motives, plan, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended execution of this enterpriſe, and that I ſhall be ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py as to meet with their approbation in it.</p>

They have been wholly employed for ſome time paſt in procuring materials for barracks, fuel, and making other preparations for winter. Theſe circumſtances, with the conſtant additions to their works which are apparently defenſive, have led to the above concluſion, and enabled me to ſpare this body of men where I hope they will be uſefully and ſucceſsfully employed.</p>
                  <p>The ſtate of inactivity, in which this army has lain for ſome time, by no means correſponds with my wiſhes, by ſome deciſive ſtroke to relieve my country from the heavy expenſe its ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtence muſt create. After frequently reconnoitring the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the enemy the town of Boſton, collecting all poſſible intelligence, and digeſting the whole, a ſurpriſe did not appear
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:031423_0030_0FEC4A149BE73040"/>
to me wholly impracticable, though hazardous. I communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it to the general officers ſome days before I called them to a council, that they might be prepared with their opinions. The reſult I have the honor of incloſing (No. 6). I cannot ſay that I have wholly laid it aſide: but new events may occaſion new meaſures. Of this I hope the honorable Congreſs can need no aſſurance, that there is not a man in America who more earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wiſhes ſuch a termination of the campaign, as to make the army no longer neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>The ſeaſon advances ſo faſt, that I have given orders to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare barracks and other accommodations for the winter. The great ſcarcity of tow-cloth in this country, I fear, will totally diſappoint us in our expectations of procuring hunting-ſhirts.—Governor Cooke informs me, few or none are to be had in Rhode-Iſland; and governor Trumbull gives me little encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to expect many from Connecticut.</p>
                  <p>I have filled up the office of quarter-maſter-general, which the Congreſs was pleaſed to leave to me, by the appointment of major Mifflin, which I hope and believe will be univerſally ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable.</p>
                  <p>It gives me great pain to be obliged to ſolicit the attention of the honorable Congreſs to the ſtate of this army, in terms which imply the ſlighteſt apprehenſion of being neglected. But my ſituation is inexpreſſibly diſtreſſing, to ſee the winter faſt approaching upon a naked army; the time of their ſervice with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in a few weeks of expiring; and no proviſion yet made for ſuch important events. Added to theſe, the military cheſt is totally exhauſted: the paymaſter has not a ſingle dollar in hand: the commiſſary-general aſſures me he has ſtrained his credit, for the ſubſiſtence of the army, to the utmoſt. The quarter-maſter-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral is preciſely in the ſame ſituation; and the greater part of the troops not far from mutiny, upon the deduction of their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted allowance. I know not to whom I am to impute this fail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure: but I am opinion, if the evil is not immediately remedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and more punctually obſerved in future, the army muſt ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely break up. I hope I have ſo fully expreſſed myſelf on this ſubject (both by letter, and to thoſe members of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs who honored the camp with a viſit), that no diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment could poſſibly happen: I therefore hourly expected ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice from the paymaſter that he had received a freſh ſupply, in addition to the hundred and ſeventy-two thouſand dollars deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered him in Auguſt: and thought myſelf warranted to aſſure the public creditors that in a few days they ſhould be ſatisfied. But the delay has brought matters to ſuch a criſis, as admits of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:031423_0031_0FEC47F724EE6FF0"/>
no further uncertain expectation. I have therefore ſent off this expreſs, with orders to make all poſſible diſpatch. It is my moſt earneſt requeſt that he may be returned with all poſſible expedition, unleſs the honorable Congreſs have already forwar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded what is ſo indiſpenſably neceſſary.</p>

                  <p>THE reverend Mr. Kirkland, the bearer of this, having been introduced to the honorable Congreſs, can need no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular recommendation from me. But as he now wiſhes to have the affair of his miſſion and public employ put upon ſome ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble footing, I cannot but intimate my ſenſe of the importance of his ſtation, and the great advantages which have and may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult to the United Colonies, from his ſituation being made re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable.</p>
                  <p>All accounts agree that much of the favorable diſpoſition ſhewn by the Indians, may be aſcribed to his labor and influence. He has accompanied a chief of the Oneidas to this camp, which I have endeavored to make agreeable to him, both by civility and ſome ſmall preſents.

                  <p>I WAS honored with your favor of the twenty-ſixth ul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timo, late the night before laſt; and a meeting of the general officers having been called upon a buſineſs which will make a conſiderable part of this letter, I took the opportunity of lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before them thoſe parts of yours which reſpect the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and new-modelling of the army, the fuel, clothing, and other preparations for the enſuing winter. They have taken
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:031423_0032_0FEC4A5AF1FF5CB8"/>
two or three days to conſider; and, as ſoon as I am poſſeſſed of their opinions, I ſhall loſe no time in tranſmitting the reſult, not only on the above ſubjects, but the number of troops neceſſary to be kept up.</p>
                  <p>I have alſo directed the commiſſary-general and the quarter maſter-general to prepare eſtimates of the expence of their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments for a certain given number of men, from which a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be made, when the number of men, to be kept in pay is determined:—all which I ſhall do myſelf the honor to lay before the Congreſs, as ſoon as they are ready.</p>
                  <p>I have now a painful, though a neceſſary duty to perform, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting Dr. Church, director-general of the hoſpital. About a week ago, Mr. ſecretary Ward of Providence, ſent up to me one Wainwood, an inhabitant of Newport, with a letter direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Major Cane in Boſton, in [<hi>accult</hi>] characters, which he ſaid had been left with Wainwood ſome time ago, by a woman who was kept by Dr. Church. She had before preſſed Wain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood to take her to captain Wallace, Mr. Dudley the collec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, or George Rome; which he declined. She then gave him the letter, with a ſtrict charge to deliver it to either of thoſe gentlemen. He ſuſpecting ſome improper correſpondence, kept the letter, and after ſome time opened it; but, not being able to read it, laid it up, where it remained until he received an obſcure letter from the woman, expreſſing an anxiety after the original letter. He then communicated the whole matter to Mr. Ward, who ſent him up with the papers to me. I imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately ſecured the woman; but for a long time ſhe was proof againſt every threat and perſuaſion to diſcover the author.—However, at length ſhe was brought to a confeſſion, and named Dr. Church. I then immediately ſecured him and all his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers. Upon his firſt examination, he readily acknowledged the letter, ſaid it was deſigned for his brother Fleming, and, when deciphered, would be found to contain nothing criminal. He acknowledged his never having communicated the correſpond<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to any perſon here but the girl, and made many proteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the purity of his intentions. Having found a perſon ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of deciphering the letter, I, in the mean time, had all his papers ſearched, but found nothing criminal among them: but it appeared on enquiry, that a confident had been among the papers before my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">
                        <desc>••••</desc>
                     </gap>enger arrived. I then called the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral officers together for their advice, the reſult of which you will find in the incloſure, No. 1. The deciphered letter is the incloſure No. 2. The army and country are exceedingly irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated; and upon a free diſcuſſion of the nature, circumſtances,
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:031423_0033_0FEC4A6771B357C8"/>
and conſequence of this matter, it has been unanimouſly agreed to lay it before the honorable Congreſs for their ſpecial advice and direction; at the ſame time ſuggeſting to their conſideration, whether an alteration of the twenty-eighth article of war may not be neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>As I ſhall reſerve all further remarks upon the ſtate of the army till my next, I ſhall now beg leave to requeſt the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of Congreſs, as to the property and diſpoſal of ſuch veſſels and cargoes as are deſigned for the ſupply of the enemy, and may fall into our hands. There has been an event of this kind at Portſmouth (as by the incloſure, No. 3), in which I have directed the cargo to be brought hither for the uſe of the army, reſerving the ſettlement of any claims of capture to the deciſion of Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>As there are many unfortunate individuals whoſe property has been confiſcated by the enemy, I would humbly ſuggeſt to the conſideration of Congreſs the humanity of applying, in part or in the whole, ſuch captures to the relief of thoſe ſufferers, after compenſating any expence of the captors, and for their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity and ſpirit. I am the more induced to requeſt this deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination may be ſpeedy, as I have directed three veſſels to be equipped in order to cut off the ſupplies; and, from the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of veſſels hourly arriving, it may become an object of ſome importance. In the diſpoſal of theſe captures, for the encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement of the officers and men, I have allowed them one-third of the cargoes, except military ſtores, which, with the veſſels, are to be reſerved for the public uſe. I hope my plan, as well as the execution, will be favored with the approbation of Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>One Mr. Fiſk, an intelligent perſon, came out of Boſton on the third inſtant, and gives us the following advices:—that a fleet, conſiſting of a ſixty-four, and twenty-gun ſhip, two ſloops of eighteen guns, and two tranſports with ſix hundred men, were to ſail from Boſton as yeſterday; that they took on board two mortars, four howitzers, and other artillery, calculated for the bombardment of a town:—their deſtination was kept a profound ſecret:—that an expreſs ſloop of war, which left En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland the eighth Auguſt, arrived four days ago;—that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Gage is recalled, and laſt ſunday, reſigned his command to General Howe;—that Lord Percy, colonel Smith, and other offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers who were at Lexington, are ordered home with Gage;—that ſix ſhips of the line and two cutters were coming out un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſir Peter Dennis;—that five regiments and a thouſand ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rines are ordered out, and may be expected in three or four
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031423_0034_0FEC4A6979E5CAE8"/>
weeks:—no proſpect of accommodation; but the miniſtry deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to puſh the war to the utmoſt.</p>
                  <p>I have an expreſs from colonel Arnold, and herewith ſend a copy of his letter and an incloſure, No. 4 and 5.—I am happy in finding he meets with no diſcouragement.—The claim of the rifle officers, to be independent of all the ſuperior officers, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept colonel Arnold, is without any countenance or authority from me, as I have ſignified in my laſt diſpatch both to colonel Arnold and captain Morgan.—The captain of the brig from Quebec for Boſton, informs me, that there is no ſuſpicion of any ſuch expedition; and that, if Carleton is not driven from St. John's, ſo as to be obliged to throw himſelf into Quebec, it muſt fall into our hands, as it is left without a regular ſoldier, and many of the inhabitants are moſt favourably diſpoſed to the American cauſe;—and that there is the largeſt ſtock of ammunition ever collected in America.</p>
                  <p>In the above veſſel ſome letters were alſo found, from an officer at Quebec, to General Gage and major Sheriff at Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, containing ſuch an account of the temper of the Canadi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, as cannot but afford the higheſt ſatisfaction. I have thought it beſt to forward them: they are the incloſures, No. 6 and 7.</p>

                  <p>I AM honored with your ſeveral favors of the twenty-ſixth and thirtieth September, and fifth October, the contents of which I ſhall beg leave to notice in their reſpective order.</p>
                  <p>Previous to the direction of Congreſs to conſult the general officers on the beſt mode of continuing and providing for the army during the winter, I had deſired them to turn their thoughts upon theſe ſubjects, and to favor me with the reſult, by a particular day, in writing. In this interval, the appointment of Dr. Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, Mr. Lynch, and colonel Harriſon, was communicated,—an event, which has given me the higheſt ſatisfaction, as the ſubject was too weighty and complex for a diſcuſſion by letter. This appointment made any concluſion here unneceſſary, as it is not probable any ſuch arrangement would be agreed on, as would not be altered in ſome reſpects, upon a full and free conference. This good effect will ariſe from the ſtep already taken, that every officer will be prepared to give his ſentiments upon theſe important ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="36" facs="unknown:031423_0035_0FEC4A6E88600EE8"/>
The eſtimates of the commiſſary and quarter-maſter-general I have now the honor of incloſing. The firſt is No. 1,—the other No. 2.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the reduction of the pay of the men, which may enter into the conſideration of their ſupport, it is the unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous opinion of the general officers, that it cannot be touched with ſafety at preſent. * * *</p>
                  <p>Upon the preſumption of there being a vacancy in the direction of the hoſpital, lieutenant-colonel Hand, formerly a ſurgeon in the eighteenth regiment of royal Iriſh, and Dr. Foſter, late of Charleſtown, and one of the ſurgeons of the hoſpital under Dr. Church, are candidates for that office. I do not pretend to be acquainted with their reſpective merits, and therefore have given them no farther expectation, than that they ſhould be mentioned as candidates for the department. I therefore need only to add upon this ſubject, that the affairs of the hoſpital require that the appointment ſhould be made as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>Before I was honored with your favor of the fifth inſtant, I had given orders for the equipment of ſome armed veſſels, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercept the enemy's ſupplies of proviſions and ammunition. One of them was on a cruiſe between Cape Anne and Cape Cod, when the expreſs arrived. The others will be fit for the ſea in a few days, under the command of officers of the continental army, who are well recommended, as perſons acquainted with the ſea, and capable of ſuch a ſervice. Two of theſe will be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately diſpatched on this duty; and every particular, mentioned in your favor of the fifth inſtant, literally complied with.</p>
                  <p>That the honorable Congreſs may have a more complete idea of the plan on which theſe veſſels are equipped, I incloſe a copy of the inſtructions given to the captains now out, (No. 4). Theſe, with the additional inſtructions directed, will be given to the captains who go into the mouth of St. Lawrence's river. As both officers and men moſt cheerfully engage in the ſervice on the terms mentioned in theſe inſtructions, I fear that the propoſed increaſe will create ſome difficulty, by making a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between men engaged on ſimilar ſervice. I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore not yet communicated this part of the plan, but reſerved an extra bounty as a reward for extraordinary activity. There are no armed veſſels in this province; and governor Cooke informs me the enterpriſe can receive no aſſiſtance from him, as one of the armed veſſels of Rhode-Iſland is on a long cruiſe, and the other unfit for ſervice. Nothing ſhall be omitted to ſecure ſucceſs. A fortunate capture of an ordnance ſhip would give new life to the camp, and an immediate turn to the iſſue of the campaign.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="37" facs="unknown:031423_0036_0FEC4A72E1D8CF68"/>
Our laſt accounts from colonel Arnold are very favorable: he was proceeding with all expedition; and I flatter myſelf (making all allowances) he will be at Quebec the twentieth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, where a gentleman from Canada (Mr. * * *) aſſures me he will meet with no reſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>In the quarter-maſter's eſtimate, there are ſome articles omitted, of which he informs me he cannot pretend to furniſh a compu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation,—ſuch as cartage, tools, &amp;c. for which ſome general allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance muſt be made.</p>
                  <p>From the various accounts received from Europe, there may be reaſon to expect troops will be landed at New-York, or ſome other middle colony. I ſhould be glad to know the pleaſure of the Congreſs, whether, upon ſuch an event, it would be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected that a part of this army ſhould be detached, or the internal force of ſuch colony and its neighbourhood be deemed ſufficient; or whether, in ſuch caſe, I am to wait the particular direction of Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>The fleet, mentioned in my laſt, has been ſeen ſtanding N. N. E. ſo that we apprehend it is intended for ſome part of this province, or New-Hampſhire, or poſſibly Quebec.</p>
                  <p>The lateſt and beſt accounts we have from the enemy, are, that they are engaged in their new work acroſs the ſouth end of Boſton, preparing their barracks, &amp;c. for winter:—that it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to keep from five hundred to a thouſand men on Bunker's hill all winter, who are to be relieved once a week;—the reſt to be drawn into Boſton.</p>
                  <p>A perſon who has lately been a ſervant to major Conolly, (a tool of Lord Dunmore's) has given an account of a ſcheme to diſtreſs the ſouthern provinces, which appeared to me of ſufficient conſequence to be immediately tranſmitted. I have therefore got it atteſted, and do myſelf the honor of incloſing it, No. 5.</p>
                  <p>The new levies from Connecticut have lately marched into camp, and are a body of as good troops as any we have: ſo that we have now the ſame ſtrength, as before the detachment made under colonel Arnold.</p>
                  <p>I am, with the moſt reſpectful ſentiments to the honorable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and yourſelf, ſir, your moſt obedient, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>MY conjecture of the deſtination of the late ſquadron from Boſton, in my laſt, has been unhappily verified by an out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage, exceeding, in barbarity and cruelty, every hoſtile act practiſed among civiliſed nations. I have encloſed the account given me by Mr. Jones, a gentleman of the town of Falmouth, of the deſtruction of that increaſing and flouriſhing village. He is a very great ſufferer, and informs me that the time allowed for the removal of effects was ſo ſmall, that valuable property of all kinds, and to a great amount, has been deſtroyed. The or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders ſhewn by the captain for this horrid procedure, (by which it appears the ſame deſolation is meditated upon all the towns on the coaſt) made it my duty to communicate it as quickly and extenſively as poſſible. As Portſmouth was the next place to which he propoſed to go, general Sullivan was permitted to go up, and give them his aſſiſtance and advice to ward off the blow.

                  <p>The information, which the gentlemen who have lately gone from hence can give the Congreſs, of the ſtate and ſituation of the army, would have made a letter unneceſſary, if I did not ſuppoſe there would be ſome anxiety to know the intentions of the army on the ſubject of the re-enliſtment.</p>
                  <p>Agreeable to the advice of thoſe gentlemen, and my own opinion, I immediately began by directing all ſuch officers as propoſed to continue, to ſignify their intentions as ſoon as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. A great number of the returns are come in, from which I find that a very great proportion of the officers of the rank
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:031423_0038_0FEC4A76E5575380"/>
of captains, and under, will retire;—from preſent appearances, I may ſay, half,—but at leaſt, one third. It is with ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern alſo that I obſerve, that many of the officers who retire, diſcourage the continuance of the men, and, I fear, will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate the infection to them. Some have adviſed that thoſe officers who decline the ſervice ſhould be immediately diſmiſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but this would be very dangerous and inconvenient. I confeſs I have great anxieties upon the ſubject, though I ſtill hope the pay and terms are ſo advantageous, that intereſt, and, I hope alſo, a regard to their country, will retain a greater proportion of privates than their officers. In ſo important a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I ſhall eſteem it my indiſpenſable duty, not only to act with all poſſible prudence, but to give the moſt early and conſtant ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of my progreſs.</p>
                  <p>A ſupply of cloathing, equal to our neceſſities, would greatly contribute to the encouragement and ſatisfaction of the men. In every point of view, it is ſo important that I beg leave to call the attention of the Congreſs to it in a particular manner.</p>

                  <p>I COULD not ſuffer Mr. Randolph to quit this camp with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out bearing ſome teſtimony of my duty to the Congreſs; although his ſudden departure (occaſioned by the death of his worthy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative, whoſe loſs, as a good citizen, and valuable member of ſociety, is much to be regretted) does not allow me time to be particular.</p>
                  <p>The incloſed return ſhews, at one view, what reliance we have upon the officers of this army, and how deficient we are like to be in ſubaltern officers. A few days more will enable me to inform the Congreſs what they have to expect from the ſoldiery, as I ſhall iſſue recruiting orders for this purpoſe, ſo ſoon as the officers are appointed,—which will be done this day,—having ſent for the general officers, to conſult them in the choice.</p>
                  <p>I muſt beg leave to recall the attention of the Congreſs to the appointment of a brigadier-general,—an officer as neceſſary to a brigade, as a colonel is to a regiment, and will be exceedingly wanted in the new arrangement.</p>

                  <p>The immediate occaſion of my giving the Congreſs the trouble of a letter at this time is to inform them, that, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of their order, ſignified in your letter of the twentieth ultimo, I laid myſelf under a ſolemn tie of ſecrecy to captain M'Pherſon, and proceeded to examine his plan for the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the fleet in the harbor of Boſton, with all that care and attention which the importance of it deſerved, and my judgment could lead to. But not being happy enough to coincide in opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion with that gentleman, and finding that his ſcheme would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve greater expence, than (under my doubts of its ſucceſs) I thought myſelf juſtified in giving into, I prevailed upon him to communicate his plan to three gentlemen of the artillery in this army, well acquainted in the knowledge and practice of gunnery. By them he has been convinced, that, inaſmuch as he ſet out upon wrong principles, the ſcheme would prove abortive. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing, however, to relinquiſh his favourite project of reducing the naval force of Great-Britain, he is very deſirous of build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a number of row gallies for this purpoſe. But as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs alone are competent to the adoption of this meaſure, I have adviſed him-(although he offered to go on with the building of them at his own expence, till the Congreſs ſhould decide) to repair immediately to Philadelphia with his propoſals; where, if they ſhould be agreed to, or veſſels of ſuperior force, agreeable to the wiſhes of moſt others, ſhould be reſolved on, he may ſet inſtantly about them, with all the materials upon the ſpot:—here, they are to collect.—To him therefore I refer for further informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on this head.</p>
                  <p>A veſſel, ſaid to be from Philadelphia and bound to Boſton, with a hundred and twenty pipes of wine (a hundred and eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen of which are ſecured) ſtranded at a place called Eaſtham, in a gale of wind, on the ſecond inſtant;—another, from Boſton, to Halifax, with dry goods &amp;c. (amounting, per invoice, to about two hundred and forty pounds lawful money) got diſabled in the ſame gale, near Beverly. Theſe cargoes, with the papers, I have
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:031423_0040_0FEC4A7F11EF4348"/>
ordered to this place,—the veſſels to be taken care of till fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther orders. I have alſo an account of the taking of a wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſloop bound to Boſton, and carried into Portſmouth by one of our armed veſſels;—particulars not yet come to hand;—and this inſtant, of two others, from Nova-Scotia to Boſton, with hay, wood, live ſtock, &amp;c. by another of our armed ſchooners.—Theſe are in Plymouth.</p>
                  <p>Theſe accidents and captures point out the neceſſity of eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proper courts without loſs of time, for the deciſion of property, and the legality of ſeizures; otherwiſe I may be involved in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>extricable difficulties.</p>
                  <p>Our priſoners, by the reduction of Fort Chamblee (on which happy event I moſt ſincerely congratulate the Congreſs), being conſiderably augmented, and likely to be increaſed, I ſubmit it to the wiſdom of Congreſs, whether ſome convenient inland towns, remote from the poſt-roads, ought not to be aſſigned them; the manner of their treatment, ſubſiſtence, &amp;c. defin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and a commiſſary or agent appointed, to ſee that juſtice is done both to them and the public, proper accounts rendered, &amp;c. Without a mode of this ſort is adopted, I fear there will be ſad confuſion hereafter, as there are great complaints at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent.</p>
                  <p>I reckoned without my hoſt, when I informed the Congreſs in my laſt, that I ſhould in a day or two be able to acquaint them of the diſpoſition of the ſoldiery towards a new enliſtment-I have been in conſultation with the generals of this army ever ſince Thurſday laſt, endeavoring to eſtabliſh new corps of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers; but find ſo many doubts and difficulties to reconcile, that I cannot ſay when they are to end, or what may be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences; as there appears to be ſuch an unwillingneſs in the officers of one government mixing in the ſame regiment with thoſe of another; and, without it, many muſt be diſmiſſed, who are willing to ſerve; notwithſtanding, we are deficient on the whole.</p>
                  <p>The council of Officers are unanimouſly of opinion that the command of the artillery ſhould no longer continue in colonel * * *; and knowing of no perſon better qualified to ſupply his place, or whoſe appointment will give more general ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, have taken the liberty of recommending Henry Knox, eſquire, to the conſideration of Congreſs, thinking it indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly neceſſary, at the ſame time, that this regiment ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt of two lieutenant-colonels, two majors, and twelve compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, agreeable to the plan and eſtimate handed in; which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:031423_0041_0FEC4A828313E720"/>
from the laſt eſtabliſhment, I ſhould be glad to be inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on.</p>
                  <p>The commiſſary-general not being returned, will apologiſe, I hope, for my ſilence reſpecting a requiſition of the expence of his clerks, &amp;c. which I was to have obtained together with others, and forwarded.</p>
                  <p>I have heard nothing of colonel Arnold ſince the thirteenth ultimo. His letter of, and journal to that date, will convey all the information I am able to give of him. I think he muſt be in Quebec. If any miſchance had happened to him, he would, as directed, have forwarded an expreſs.—No account yet of the arm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed veſſels ſent to St. Laurence.—I think they will meet the ſtores inward or outward bound.</p>
                  <p>Captain Symons, in the Cerberus, lately ſent from Boſton to Falmouth, hath publiſhed the incloſed declaration at that place; and it is ſuſpected he intends to make ſome kind of a lodgment there. I wrote immediately to colonel Finnie, of this army, who went up there upon the laſt alarm, to ſpirit up the people and oppoſe it at all events.—Falmouth is about a hundred and thirty miles from this camp.</p>

                  <p>* * * Incloſed, you have a copy of an act, paſſed this ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, by the honorable council and houſe of repreſentatives of this province. It reſpects ſuch captures as may be made by veſſels fitted out by the province, or by individuals thereof.—As the armed veſſels, fitted out at the continental expence, do not come under this law, I would have it ſubmitted to the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Congreſs, to point out a more ſummary way of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding, to determine the property and mode of condemnation of ſuch prizes as have been or hereafter may be made, than is ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in this act.</p>
                  <p>Should not a court be eſtabliſhed by authority of Congreſs, to take cogniſance of prizes made by the continental veſſels?—Whatever the mode is which they are pleaſed to adopt, there is an abſolute neceſſity of its being ſpeedily determined on: for I cannot ſpare time from military affairs, to give proper attention to theſe matters.</p>
                  <p>The inhabitants of Plymouth have taken a ſloop, laden with
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:031423_0042_0FEC4A8467A85FD0"/>
proviſions, &amp;c. from Halifax, bound to Boſton, and the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of Beverly have, under cover of one of the armed ſchoon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, taken a veſſel from Ireland, laden with beef, pork, butter, &amp;c. for the ſame place. The latter brings papers and letters of a very intereſting nature, which are in the hands of the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable council, who informed me they will tranſmit them to you by this conveyance. To the contents of theſe papers and letters, I muſt beg leave to refer you and the honorable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, who will now ſee the abſolute neceſſity there is, of exert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all their wiſdom, to withſtand the mighty efforts of our enemies.</p>
                  <p>The trouble I have in the arrangement of the army is really inconceivable. Many of the officers ſent in their names to ſerve, in expectation of promotion; others ſtood aloof * * *; whilſt a number who have declined, have again ſent in their names, to ſerve. So great has the confuſion, ariſing from theſe and many other perplexing circumſtances, been, that I found it abſolutely impoſſible to fix this very intereſting buſineſs exactly on the plan reſolved on in the conference, though I have kept up to the ſpirit, as near as the nature and neceſſity of the caſe would admit of; the difficulty with the ſoldiers is as great,—indeed more ſo, if poſſible, than with the officers. They will not enliſt, until they know their colonel, lieutenant-colonel, major, captain, &amp;c. ſo that it was neceſſary to fix the officers the firſt thing; which is, at laſt, in ſome manner done; and I have given out enliſting orders.</p>
                  <p>You, ſir, can much eaſier judge, than I can expreſs, the anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iety of mind I muſt labor under on the occaſion, eſpecially at this time, when we may expect the enemy will begin to act on the arrival of their reinforcement, part of which is already come, and the remainder daily dropping in.</p>
                  <p>I have other diſtreſſes of a very alarming nature. The arms of our ſoldiery are ſo exceeding bad, that I aſſure you, ſir, I cannot place a proper confidence in them. Our powder is waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing faſt, notwithſtanding the ſtricteſt care, economy, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention is paid to it. The long ſeries of wet weather we have had, renders the greater part of what has been ſerved out to the men, of no uſe. Yeſterday I had a proof of it, as a party of the enemy, about four or five hundred, taking the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of a high tide, landed at Leechmore's point: we were a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larmed, and of courſe ordered every man to examine his car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>touch-box; when the melancholy truth appeared; and we were obliged to furniſh the greater part of them with freſh ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="44" facs="unknown:031423_0043_0FEC4A8C00755EE0"/>
The damage done at the point was the taking of a man who watched a few horſes and cows; ten of the latter they carried off. Colonel Thompſon marched down with his regiment of riflemen, and was joined by colonel Woodbridge, with a part of his and a part of Patterſon's regiment, who gallantly waded through the water, and ſoon obliged the enemy to embark un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der cover of a man-of-war, a floating battery, and the fire of a battery on Charleſtown neck. We have two of our men dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerouſly wounded by grape ſhot from the man-of-war, and, by a flag ſent out this day, we are informed the enemy loſt two of their men.</p>

                  <p>I received your favors of the ſeventh and tenth inſtant, with the reſolves of the honorable Congreſs, to which I will pay all due attention.—As ſoon as two capable perſons can be found, I will diſpatch them to Nova-Scotia, on the ſervice reſolved on in Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>The reſolve to raiſe two battalions of marines will (if practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable in this army) entirely derange what has been done. It is therein mentioned, "one colonel for the two battalions."—of courſe, a colonel muſt be diſmiſſed. One of the many diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties, which attended the new arrangement, was in reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the different intereſts, and judging of the merits of the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent colonels.—In the diſmiſſion of this one, the ſame difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties will occur.—The officers and men muſt be acquainted with maritime affairs; to comply with which, they muſt be picked out of the whole army,—one from this corps, one from another,—ſo as to break through the whole ſyſtem, which has coſt us ſo much time, anxiety and pains, to bring into any to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable form. Notwithſtanding any difficulties which will ariſe, you may be aſſured, ſir, that I will uſe every endeavor to comply with their reſolve.</p>
                  <p>I beg leave to ſubmit it to the conſideration of Congreſs (if theſe two battalions can be formed out of this army) whether this is a time to weaken our lines, by employing any of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces appointed to defend them, on any other ſervice. The gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who were here from the Congreſs know their vaſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent: they muſt know that we ſhall have occaſion for our whole force for that purpoſe; more ſo now than at any paſt time, as we may expect the enemy will take the advantage of the firſt
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:031423_0044_0FEC4A8F40273EE0"/>
hard weather, and attempt to make an impreſſion ſomewhere. That this is their intention, we have many reaſons to ſuſpect.</p>
                  <p>We have had, in the laſt week, ſix deſerters, and took two ſtraggling priſoners. They all agree that two companies, with a train of artillery and one of the regiments from Ireland, were ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at Boſton;—that freſh ammunition and flints have been ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out;—that the grenadiers and light infantry had orders to hold themſelves in readineſs at a moment's warning.</p>
                  <p>As there is every appearance that this conteſt will not be ſoon decided, and of courſe that there muſt be an augmentation of the continental army, would it not be eligible to raiſe two battalions of marines in New-York and Philadelphia, where there muſt be numbers of ſailors now unemployed?—This however is matter of opinion, which I mention with all due deference to the ſuperior judgment of the Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed, you have copies of two letters,—one from colonel Arnold,—the other from colonel * * *. I can form no judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the latter's conduct, until I ſee him. Notwithſtanding the great defection, I do not diſpair of colonel Arnold's ſucceſs. He will have, in all probability, many more difficulties to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counter, than if he had been a fortnight ſooner; as it is likely that governor Carleton will, with what forces he can collect after the ſurrender of the reſt of Canada, throw himſelf into Quebec, and there make his laſt effort. There is no late account from captains Broughton and Sillman, ſent to the river St. Laurence. The other cruiſers have been chiefly confined to harbor, by the badneſs of the weather. The ſame reaſon has cauſed great delay in building of our barracks; which, with a moſt morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying ſcarcity of fire-wood, diſcourages the men from enliſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The laſt, I am afraid, is an inſuperable obſtacle. I have applied to the honorable houſe of repreſentatives of this province, who were pleaſed to appoint a committee to negotiate this bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; and notwithſtanding all the pains they have and are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king, they find it impoſſible to ſupply our neceſſities. The want of a ſufficient number of teams, I underſtand to be the chief im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediment.</p>
                  <p>I got returns this day from eleven colonels, of the numbers enliſted in their regiments. The whole amount is nine hundred and ſixty-ſix men. There muſt be ſome other ſtimulus beſides love for their country, to make men fond of the ſervice. It would be a great encouragement, and no additional expence to the continent, were they to receive pay for the months of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober and November; alſo a month's pay advance. The pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent

                  <p>I HAD the honor of writing to you on the nineteenth inſtant. I have now to inform you that Henry Knox, eſquire, is gone to New-York, with orders to forward to this place what cannon and ordnance ſtores can be there procured. From thence he will proceed to general Schuyler on the ſame buſineſs, as you will ſee by the incloſed copy of inſtructions which I have given him. It would give me much ſatisfaction, that this gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman, or any other whom you may think qualified, was ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to the command of the artillery regiment. In my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to you, of the eighth inſtant, I have expreſſed myſelf ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on this ſubject, which I beg leave to recommend <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> your immediate attention; as the formation of that corps will be at a ſtand, until I am honored with your inſtructions thereon. * * * *</p>
                  <p>There are two perſons engaged to go Nova-Scotia, on the buſineſs recommended in your laſt. By the beſt information we have from thence, the ſtores, &amp;c. have been withdrawn ſome time. Should this not be the caſe, it is next to an impoſſibility to attempt any thing there, in the preſent unſettled and precarious ſtate of the army. * * *</p>
                  <p>From what I can collect in my enquiries amongſt the officers, it will be impoſſible to get the men to enliſt for the continuance of the war; which will be an inſuperable obſtruction to the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the two battallions of marines on the plan reſolved on in Congreſs. As it can make no difference, I propoſe to proceed ceed on the new arrangement of the army, and, when completed, inquire out ſuch officers and men as are beſt qualified for that ſervice, and endeavor to form theſe two battalions out of the whole. This appears to me the beſt method, and will, I hope, meet the approbation of Congreſs.</p>

As it will be very difficult for the men to work when the hard froſt ſets in, I have thought it neceſſary (though of little uſe at preſent) to take poſſeſſion of Coble-hill, for the benefit of any future operations. It was effected, without the leaſt oppoſition from the enemy, the twenty-third inſtant. Their inactivity on this occaſion is what I cannot account for:—it is probable they are meditating a blow ſomewhere.</p>
                  <p>About three hundred men, women and children, of the poor inhabitants of Boſton, came out to Point-Shirley laſt Friday—They have brought their houſehold furniture, but are unprovided of every other neceſſary of life. I have recommended them to the attention of the committee of the honorable council of this province now ſitting at Watertown.</p>
                  <p>The number enliſted ſince my laſt are two thouſand four hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty men, * * * * Our ſituation is truly alarming: and of this general Howe is well appriſed, it being the common topic of converſation when the people left Boſton laſt friday.—No doubt, when he is reinforced, he will avail himſelf of the information.</p>
                  <p>I am making the beſt diſpoſition I can for our defence, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thrown up, beſides the work on Coble-hill, ſeveral redoubts, half-moons, &amp;c. along the bay: and I fear I ſhall be under the neceſſity of calling in the militia and minute-men of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to my aſſiſtance: I ſay, I fear it,—becauſe, by what I can learn from the officers in the army, belonging to this colony, it will be next to an impoſſibility to keep them under any degree of diſcipline, and that it will be very difficult to prevail on them to remain a moment longer than they chuſe themſelves. It is a mortifying reflection, to be reduced to this dilemna. There has been nothing wanting on my part, to infuſe a proper ſpirit amongſt the officers, that they may exert their influence with the ſoldiery. You ſee, by a fortnight's recruiting amongſt men with arms in their hands, how little has been the ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>As the ſmall-pox is now in Boſton, I have uſed the precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of prohibiting ſuch as lately came out, from coming near our camp.—General Burgoyne, I am informed, will ſoon em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bark for England.—I think the riſk too great to write you by poſt, whilſt it continues to paſs through New-York. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that a poſt has been intercepted the beginning of laſt month, as they ſent out ſeveral letters from Boſton, with the poſt-mark of Baltimore on them. This goes by captain Joſeph Blewer, who promiſes to deliver it carefully unto you.</p>
                  <p>You, doubtleſs, will have heard, before this reaches, of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Montgomery's having got poſſeſſion of Montreal. I congratu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late

you thereon. He has troubles with his troops, as well as I have.—All I can learn of colonel Arnold is, that he is neat Quebec. I hope Montgomery will be able to proceed to his aſſiſtance. I ſhall be very uneaſy until I hear they are joined.</p>
                  <p>My beſt reſpects attend the gentlemen in Congreſs: and believe me, ſir, your moſt obedient, &amp;c.</p>

Cape-Anne is a very open harbour, and acceſſible to large ſhips; which made me immediately ſend off colonel Glover and Mr. Palfry, with orders to raiſe the minute-men and militia of that part of the country, to have the cargo landed without loſs of time, and guarded up to this camp.

                  <p>I HAD the honor of writing to you, the thirtieth ultimo, incloſing an inventory of the military ſtores taken on board the brig Nancy by captain Manly of the armed ſchooner Lee. I have now to inform you that he has ſince ſent into Beverly, a ſhip named the Concord, James Lowrie, maſter, from Greenock in Scotland, bound to Boſton. She has on board dry goods and coals, to the value of three thouſand ſix hundred and ſix pounds, nine ſhillings and ſeven pence, ſterling, ſhipped by Craw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, Anderſon and Co. and conſigned to James Anderſon, merchant in Boſton. It is mentioned in the letters found on board, that this cargo was for the uſe of the army; but, on a ſtrict examination, I find it is really the property of the ſhippers and the perſon to whom conſigned.—Pray what is to
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:031423_0048_0FEC4A9A40E91BC8"/>
be done with this ſhip and cargo? and what with the brigantine which brought the military ſtores?—It was agreed, in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference laſt October, "<hi>that all veſſels employed merely as tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and unarmed, with their crews, be ſet at liberty, upon giving ſecurity to return to Europe; but that this indulgence be not extended longer than till the firſt of April next.</hi>" In the ſhippers' letter, they mention: "you muſt procure a certificate from the general and admiral, of the Concord being in the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment ſervice, ſuch as the Glaſgow packet brought with her, which was of great ſervice, procured a liberty to arm her, which was refuſed us; alſo gave her a preference for ſome recruits that went out in her." In another part of the letter, they ſay:—"Captain Lowrie will deliver you the contract for the coals: we gave it to him, as it perhaps might be of uſe, as a certificate of his ſhip being employed in the government ſervice." Every letter on board breathes nothing but enmity to this country: and a vaſt number of them there are.</p>
                  <p>It is ſome time ſince I recommended to the Congreſs that they would inſtitute a court for the trial of prizes made by the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental armed veſſels: which I hope they have ere now taken into their conſideration: otherwiſe I ſhould again take the liberty of urging it in the moſt preſſing manner.</p>
                  <p>The conduct of a great number of the Connecticut troops has laid me under the neceſſity of calling in a body of the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia much ſooner than I apprehended there would be an occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for ſuch a ſtep. I was afraid ſome time ago that they would incline to go home when the time of their enliſtment expired. I called upon the officers of the ſeveral regiments, to know whether they could prevail on the men to remain un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til the firſt of January, or till a ſufficient number of other for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces could be raiſed to ſupply their place. I ſuppoſe they were deceived themſelves: I know they deceived me by aſſurances that I need be under no apprehenſions on that ſcore, for the men would not leave the lines. Laſt friday ſhewed how much they were miſtaken, as the major part of the troops of that colony were going away with their arms and ammunition. We have however, by threats, perſuaſion, and the activity of the people of the country, who ſent back many of them that had ſet out, prevailed upon the moſt part to ſtay. There are about eighty of them miſſing.</p>
                  <p>I have called in three thouſand men from this province; and general Sullivan, who lately returned from the province of New-Hampſhire, having informed me that a number of men were there ready, at the ſhorteſt notice, I have demanded two
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:031423_0049_0FEC4A9D43174668"/>
thouſand from that province. Theſe two bodies, I expect, will be in by the tenth inſtant, to make up the deficiency of the Connecticut-men, whom I have promiſed to diſmiſs on that day, as well as the numbers to whom I was obliged to grant furloughs before any would enliſt.—As the ſame defection is much to be apprehended when the time of the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts-Bay, New-Hampſhire, and Rhode-Iſland forces is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired, I beg the attention of Congreſs to this important affair.</p>
                  <p>I am informed that it has been the cuſtom of theſe provinces in the laſt war, for the legiſlative power to order every town to provide a certain quota of men for the campaign. This or ſome other mode ſhould be at preſent adopted, as I am ſatisfied the men cannot be had without. This the Congreſs will pleaſe to take into their immediate conſideration. My ſuſpicions on this head I ſhall alſo communicate to the governors Trumbull and Cooke, alſo to the New-Hampſhire convention.</p>
                  <p>The number enliſted in the laſt week are about thirteen hundred men. By this you ſee how ſlow this important work goes on. * * *</p>
                  <p>An expreſs is juſt come in from general Schuyler, with let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters from colonel Arnold and general Montgomery, copies of which I have the honor to incloſe you. Upon the whole, I think affairs carry a pleaſing aſpect in that quarter. The reduction of Quebec is an object of ſuch great importance, that I doubt not the Congreſs will give every aſſiſtance in their power for the accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhing it this winter.</p>
                  <p>By the laſt accounts from the armed ſchooners ſent to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver St. Lawrence, I fear we have but little to expect from them: they were falling ſhort of proviſion, and mention that they would be obliged to return; which at this time will be parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly unfortunate, as if they choſe a proper ſtation, all the veſſels coming down that river muſt fall into their hands. The plague, trouble, and vexation I have had with the crews of all the armed veſſels, is inexpreſſible. I do believe there is not on earth a more diſorderly ſet,—every time they come into port, we hear of nothing but mutinous complaints. Manly's ſucceſs has lately, and but lately, quieted his people. The crews of the Waſhington and Harriſon have actually deſerted them; ſo that I have been under the neceſſity of ordering the agent to lay the latter up, and get hands for the other on the beſt terms he could.</p>
                  <p>The houſe of repreſentatives and the honorable board have ſent me a vote of theirs relative to the harbor of Cape-Cod,
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:031423_0050_0FEC4AA3AC3AB930"/>
which you have herewith. I ſhall ſend an officer thither to examine what can be done for its defence, though I do not think I ſhall be able to give them ſuch aſſiſtance as may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite; for I have at preſent neither men, powder, nor cannon to ſpare. The great want of powder is what the attention of Congreſs ſhould be particularly applied to. I dare not attempt any thing offenſive, let the temptation or advantage be ever ſo great, as I have not more of that moſt eſſential article, than will be abſolutely neceſſary to defend our lines, ſhould the enemy attempt to attack them.</p>
                  <p>By recent information from Boſton, general Howe is going to ſend out a number of the inhabitants, in order, it is thought, to make more room for his expected reinforcements. There i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

I have communicated this to the general court; and recommended their attention thereto.</p>
                  <p>They are arming one of the tranſports in Boſton, with which they mean to decoy ſome of our armed veſſels. As we are appriſed of their deſign, I hope they will be diſappointed.</p>

I have wrote to the governors of Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut and Rhode-Iſland, alſo to the Convention of New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, on this ſubject. A copy of my letter to them I have the honor to incloſe herewith. A letter to the ſame purport I ſent to the legiſlature of this province.</p>
                  <p>The militia are coming in faſt. I am much pleaſed with the alacrity which the good people of this province, as well as thoſe of New-Hampſhire, have ſhewn upon this occaſion. I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the whole will be in this day and to-morrow, when what remains of the Connecticut [<hi>troops</hi>], who have not enliſted, will have liberty to go to their fire-ſides.</p>
                  <p>The commiſſary-general is ſtill, by his indiſpoſition, detained from Camp. He committed an error when making-out the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion-liſt: for he was then ſerving out (and has continued ſo to do) ſix ounces per man, per week, of butter, though it is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded in the liſt approved of by Congreſs.

                  <p>I have not heard that any more troops are arrived at Boſton; which is a lucky circumſtance, as the Connecticut troops, I now find, are for the moſt part gone off.—The houſes in Boſton are leſſening every day: They are pulled down, either for fire-wood, or to prevent the effects of fire, ſhould we attempt a bombard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or an attack upon the town.—Coble-hill is ſtrongly for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tified,

                  <p>I RECEIVED your favor of the ſecond inſtant, with the ſeveral reſolves of Congreſs therein incloſed.—The reſolves re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to captures made by continental armed veſſels only want a court eſtabliſhed for trial, to make them complete. This, I hope, will be ſoon done, as I have taken the liberty to urge it often to the Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>I am ſomewhat at a loſs to know whether I am to raiſe the two battalions of marines here, or not. As the delay can be attended with but little inconvenience, I will wait a further explanation from Congreſs, before I take any ſteps therein.</p>
                  <p>I am much pleaſed that the money will be forwarded with all poſſible expedition, as it is much wanting; alſo that Conolly and his aſſociates are taken. It has been a very fortunate diſcovery. I make no doubt but that the Congreſs will take every neceſſary meaſure to diſpoſſeſs lord Dunmore of his hold in Virginia; the ſooner ſteps are taken for that purpoſe, the more probability there will be of their being effectual. * * * *</p>
                  <p>I will make application to general Howe, and propoſe an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for Mr. Ethan Allen. I am much afraid I ſhall have a like propoſal to make for captain Martindale of the armed brig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antine Waſhington, and his men, who, it is reported, was taken a few days paſt by a man-of-war, and carried into Boſton.—We cannot expect to be always ſucceſsful.</p>
                  <p>You will doubtleſs hear of the barbarity of captain Wallace on Conanicut iſland, ere this reaches your hands.</p>
                  <p>About a hundred and fifty more of the poor inhabitants are come out of Boſton. The ſmall-pox rages all over the town: ſuch of the militia as had it not before, are now under innoculati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. This, I apprehend, is a weapon of defence they are uſing againſt us. What confirms me in this opinion, is, that I have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation that they are tearing up the pavement, to be provided againſt a bombardment.</p>

                  <p>LAST evening, eight men came in a boat from Boſton, to our guard at the ferry,—ſix of them captains of veſſels.—They brought the following account:</p>
                  <p>Yeſterday, one large mortar was carried over to Bunker's-hill:—the troops filling water, carrying it on board the tranſports:—proviſions ſcarce—not more than ſufficient for ſix weeks. One regiment of foot, and three companies of light horſe, ſail for Halifax this day.</p>

                  <p>CAPTAIN Manly, of the Lee armed ſchooner, took an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> ſent into Beverly the ſloop Betſey, A. Atkinſon maſter. She is an armed veſſel, diſpatched by lord Dunmore, with Indian corn, potatoes, and oats, for the army in Boſton. The packets of letters found on board, I have the honor to ſend you with this by captain James Chambers, they being of ſo much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that I do not think it would be prudent to truſt them by a common expreſs.</p>
                  <p>As lord Dunmore's ſchemes are fully laid open in theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, I need not point out to the Congreſs the neceſſity there is of a vigorous exertion being adopted by them, to diſpoſſeſs his lordſhip of the ſtrong hold he has got in Virginia.—I do not mean to dictate; but I am ſure they will pardon me for giving them freely my opinion, which is that the fate of America a good deal depends on his being obliged to evacuate Norfolk this winter, or not.</p>
                  <p>I have Kirkland well ſecured, and think I will ſend him to you for examination. By moſt of the letters relative to him, he is a dangerous fellow. John Stewart's letters and papers are of a very intereſting nature. Governor Tonyn's and many other letters from Auguſtine ſhewing the weakneſs of the place; at the ſame time, of what vaſt conſequence it would be for us to poſſeſs ourſelves of it, and the great quantity of ammunition contained in the forts.—Indeed theſe papers are of ſo great conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, that I think this but little inferior to any prize our famous Manly has taken.</p>
                  <p>We now work at our eaſe on Leechmore's hill. On diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering our party there yeſterday morning, the ſhip which lay oppoſite began a cannonade, to which Mount Horam added ſome ſhells.—One of our men was wounded.—We fired a few ſhot from two eighteen-pounders which are placed on Coble-hill, and ſoon obliged the ſhip to ſhift her ſtation. She now lies in the ferry-way: and, except a few ſhells from the mount in Boſton (which do no execution), we have no interruption in proſecuting our works, which will in a very ſhort time be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted. When this is done,—when we have powder to ſport with,—I think, if the Congreſs reſolve on the execution of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal made relative to the town of Boſton, it can be done.</p>
                  <p>I have ſent a letter in this day to general Howe, of which a copy goes herewith. My reaſon for pointing out brigadier-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Preſcot as the object who is to ſuffer Mr. Allen's fate, is, that, by letters from general Schuyler, and copies of letters
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:031423_0055_0FEC4ABA40EE0D68"/>
from general Montgomery to Schuyler, I am given to under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that Preſcot is the cauſe of Allen's ſufferings.—I thought it beſt to be deciſive on the occaſion, as did the generals whom I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulted thereon.</p>
                  <p>The returns of men enliſted ſince my laſt, amount to about eighteen hundred, making in the whole ſeven thouſand one hundred and forty. The militia that are come in, both from this province and New-Hampſhire, are very fine-looking men, and go through their duty with great alacrity. The diſpatch made, both by the people in marching and by the legiſlative powers in complying with my requiſition, has given me infinite ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction.</p>
                  <p>Your letter of the eighth inſtant, with the explanatory re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve reſpecting my calling forth the militia and minute-men, is come to hand; to which I ſhall pay all due attention. You have removed all the difficulties which I labored under, about the two battalions of marines. I ſhall obey the orders of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs in looking out for proper officers to command that corps. I make no doubt but, when the money arrives to pay off the arrears and the month's advance, that it will be a great encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the men to enliſt.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed is a letter I lately received from Mr. James Lovell.</p>
                  <p>His caſe is truly pitiable. I wiſh ſome mode could be fallen upon to relieve him from the cruel ſituation he is now in.—I am ſenſible of the impropriety of exchanging a ſoldier for a ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen: but there is ſomething ſo cruelly diſtreſſing in regard to this gentleman, that I dare ſay you will take it under your conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.</p>

                  <p>I HAD the honor to addreſs myſelf to you on the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth inſtant, ſince which I have received undoubted infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that the genuine inſtructions given to Conolly have not reached your hands; that they are very artfully concealed in the tree of his ſaddle, and covered with canvas ſo nicely that they are ſcarcely diſcernable; that thoſe which were found up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him were intended to deceive, if he were caught.—You will moſt certainly have his ſaddle taken to pieces, in order to diſcover this deep-laid plot.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed is a copy of general Howe's letter in anſwer to the one I wrote him the eighteenth inſtant. The conduct I am to
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:031423_0056_0FEC4ABCC9B6CD18"/>
obſerve towards brigadier Preſcot in conſequence of theſe letters, the Congreſs will oblige me by determining for me.</p>
                  <p>The gentlemen by whom you ſent the money are arrived.—The ſum they brought, though large, is not ſufficient to anſwer the demands of the army, which at this time are remarkably heavy: there is three month's pay due, one month's advance, two dollars for each blanket—the arms, that are left by thoſe who are diſmiſſed, to be paid for,—beſides the demands which are on the commiſſary and quarter-maſter-generals. You will therefore ſee the neceſſity of another remittance, which I beg may be as ſoon as you conveniently can.</p>
                  <p>I will take the opportunity of the return of theſe gentlemen, to ſend colonel Kirkland to you for examination, and that you may diſpoſe of him as to you may ſeem proper.</p>
                  <p>A committee from the general court of this province called on me the other day, informing me that they were in great want of ordnance for the defence of the colony; that, if what belonged to them, now in uſe here, was kept for the continent, they would be under the neceſſity of providing themſelves with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; of courſe what is kept muſt be paid for. There are ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the cannon of very little uſe; ſuch of them as are good, I cannot at preſent part with: perhaps when I receive the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply from New-York and Canada, it may be in my power to ſpare them.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Wadſworth has ſent in his report reſpecting Cape-Cod har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, a copy of which you will receive herewith; alſo a letter from Mr. Jacob Bailey, put into my hands by colonel Little.—It contains ſome things that may not be unworthy the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>We have made good progreſs in the works of Leechmore's point. They would have been finiſhed ere this, but for the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of the weather, which prevents our people from working.</p>
                  <p>I received a letter from governor Cooke, which expreſſes the fears of the people of Rhode-Iſland, leſt the ſhips, which we had information were ſailed with ſome troops on board, were deſtined for Newport. I ſent major-general Lee there, to point out to them ſuch defence as he may think the place capable of. I ſincerely wiſh he may be able to do it with effect, as that place, in its preſent ſtate, is an aſylum for ſuch as are diſaffected to American liberty.</p>
                  <p>Our returns of enliſtments, to this day, amount to eight thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand five hundred men.</p>

                  <p>I WROTE to you the twenty-fifth inſtant; ſince which I am not honored with any of your favors. The eſtimate I then incloſed you was calculated to pay the troops, &amp;c. up to the firſt of January. That cannot be done for want of funds in the paymaſter-general's hands; which cauſes a great murmur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing amongſt thoſe who are going off.—The monthly expences of this army amount to near two hundred and ſeventy-five thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand dollars, which I take the liberty of recommending to the obſervation of Congreſs, that their future remittances may be governed thereby.</p>
                  <p>It ſometimes happens that perſons would wiſh to depoſit mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in the hands of the paymaſter-general, for his bills on the treaſury at Philadelphia. He has hitherto declined ſuch offers, not having authority from Congreſs to draw.—Would it not be proper to give this power?—If it ſhould be approved of, you will pleaſe to point out the mode that the Congreſs would chuſe to have it done in.</p>
                  <p>The cloathing ſent to the quarter-maſter-general is not ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to put half our army into regimentals; nor is there a poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of getting any quantity here. I have wrote to general Schuyler, that I wiſh what was lodged at Albany could be ſpared for theſe troops, as General Montgomery would clothe the men under his command at Montreal. If this can be done, it will be of infinite ſervice; and no time ſhould be loſt in forwarding them to this camp.</p>
                  <p>In forming the regiments for the new eſtabliſhment, I thought it but juſtice to appoint the officers, de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ached under colonel Arnold, to commiſſions in them. Their abſence at preſent is of very great detriment to the ſervice, eſpecially in recruiting: I would therefore wiſh, if the Congreſs intend raiſing troops in or for Canada, that they could be taken in there. The ſooner I have their opinion of this matter, the better, that, if they can be commiſſioned in Canada, I may appoint officers here to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place them.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed you have a copy of repreſentation ſent to me by the legiſlative body of this province, reſpecting four companies ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned at Braintree, Weymouth, and Hingham. As they were never regimented, and were doing duty at a diſtance from the reſt of the army, I did not know whether to conſider them as a part of it; nor do I think myſelf authoriſed to direct payment for them without the approbation of Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>It has been repreſented to me that the free negroes who have
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:031423_0058_0FEC4AC155493800"/>
ſerved in this army are very much diſſatisfied at being diſcard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. As it is to be apprehended they may ſeek employ in the miniſterial army, I have preſumed to depart from the reſolution reſpecting them, and have given licence for their being enliſted. If this is diſapproved of by Congreſs, I will put a ſtop to it.</p>
                  <p>* * * I muſt remark that the pay of the aſſiſtant engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers is ſo very ſmall, that we cannot expect men of ſcience will engage in it. Thoſe gentlemen, who are in that ſtation, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained under the expectation that an additional allowance would be made them by the reſpective provinces in which they were ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, to that allowed by the Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>Captain Freeman arrived this day at camp from Canada. He left Quebec the twenty-fourth ultimo, in conſequence of general Carleton's proclamation, which I have the honor to ſend you here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with. He ſaw colonel Arnold the twenty-ſixth, and ſays that he was joined at Point-á-tremble, by general Montgomery, the firſt inſtant;—that they were about two thouſand ſtrong, and were making every preparation for attacking Quebec;—that general Carleton had with him about twelve hundred men, the majority of whom are ſailors;—that it was his opinion the French would give up the place if they get the ſame conditions granted to the inhabitants of Montreal. * * *</p>
                  <p>Captains Semple and Harbeſon take under their care, Mr. Kirkland. * * * Captain Mathews and Mr. Robinſon will ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company them. The two latter were taken priſoners by lord Dunmore, who was ſending them to Boſton, from whence there is little doubt but they would be forwarded to England, to which place I am credibly informed captain Martindale and the crew of the Waſhington are ſent; alſo colonel Allen, and the priſoners taken with him in Canada. This may account for general Howe's ſilence on the ſubject of an exchange of priſoners mentioned in my letter to him.</p>
                  <p>General Lee is juſt returned from his excurſion to Rhode-Iſland;—he has pointed out the beſt method the iſland would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of for its defence; he has endeavored all in his power to make friends of thoſe who were our enemies. You have, incloſed, a ſpecimen of his abilities in that way, for your peruſal. I am of opinion, that, if the ſame plan was purſued through every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince, it would have a very good effect.</p>
                  <p>I have long had it on my mind to mention to Congreſs that frequent applications had been made to me reſpecting the chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lain's pay, which is too ſmall to encourage men of abilities. Some of them, who have left their flocks, are obliged to pay the parſon acting for them, more than they receive. I need not
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:031423_0059_0FEC4AD05C6F9638"/>
point out the great utility of gentlemen whoſe lives and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation are unexceptionable, being employed for that ſervice, in this army. There are two ways of making it worth the attention of ſuch: one is an advancement of their pay; the other that one chaplain be appointed to two regiments. This laſt, I think, may be done without inconvenience. I beg leave to recommend this matter to Congreſs, whoſe ſentiments hereon I ſhall impati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently expect.</p>
                  <p>Upon a farther converſation with captain Freeman, he is of opinion that general Montgomery has with him near three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, including colonel Arnold's. He ſays that lord Pitt had received repeated orders from his father to return home; in conſequence of which, he had embarked ſome time in October, with a captain Green who was maſter of a veſſel belonging to Philadelphia.</p>
                  <p>By a number of ſalutes in Boſton harbor yeſterday, I fancy admiral Shuldham is arrived. Two large ſhips were ſeen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in.</p>
                  <p>Our enliſtments now amount to nine thouſand ſix hundred and fifty.</p>
                  <p>Thoſe gentlemen, who were made priſoners by lord Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more being left deſtitute of money and neceſſaries, I have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced them a hundred pounds lawful money belonging to the public, for which I have taken captain Mathews's draught on the treaſury of Virginia, which goes incloſed.</p>

But if we ſucceed as well in the laſt, as we have heretofore in the firſt, I ſhall think it the moſt fortunate event of my whole life.</p>
                  <p>By a very intelligent gentleman, a Mr. Hutchinſon, from Boſton, I learn, that it was admiral Shuldham that came into the harbor on ſaturday laſt;—that two of the five regiments from Cork are arrived at Halifax;—two others have ſailed for Quebec; but what was become of them, could not be told:—and the other (the fifty-fifth) has juſt got into Boſton. Certain it is alſo, that the greater part of the ſeventeenth regiment is arrived there, Whether we are to conclude from hence that more than five regiments have been ſent out, or that the companies of the ſeventeenth, arrived at Boſton, are part of the regiments deſtined for Hallifax and Quebec, I know not.</p>
                  <p>We alſo learn from this gentleman and others, that the troops, embarked for Halifax (as mentioned in my letter of the ſixteenth) were really deſigned for that place, but recalled from Nantaſket road, upon advice being received of the above regiments there. I am alſo informed of a fleet now getting ready under the convoy of the Scarborough and Fowey men-of-war,—conſiſting of five tranſports and two bomb veſſels, with about three hundred marines, and ſeveral flat bottomed boats. It is whiſpered that they are deſigned for Newport, but gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally thought in Boſton, that it is meant for Long-Iſland: and it is probable it will be followed by more troops, as the other tranſports are taking in water,—to lie, as others ſay, in Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taſket road, to be out of the ice. A large quantity of biſcuit is alſo baking.</p>
                  <p>As the real deſign cannot with certainty be known, I ſubmit it, with all due deference, to the ſuperior judgment of Congreſs, whether it would not be confident with prudence, to have ſome of the Jerſey troops thrown into New-York, to prevent an evil, which would be almoſt irremediable, ſhould it happen,—I mean, the landing of troops at that place, or upon Long-Iſland, near it.</p>

                  <p>EVERY account I have out of Boſton, confirms the em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barkation of troops mentioned in my laſt, which, from the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the year, and other circumſtances, muſt be deſtined for ſome expedition to the ſouthward of this. I have therefore thought it prudent to ſend major-general Lee to New-York. I have given him letters recommendatory to governor Trumbull, and to the committee of ſafety at New-York. I have good hopes that in Connecticut he will get many volunteers, who (I have ſome reaſon to think) will accompany him on this expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without more expenſe to the continent than their mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. But ſhould it be otherwiſe, and that they ſhould ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect pay, I think it is a trifling conſideration, when put in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition with the importance of the object, which is to put the city of New-York, with ſuch parts of the North river and Long-Iſland as to him ſhall ſeem proper, in that ſtate of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence, which the ſeaſon of the year and circumſtances will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of,—ſo as, if poſſible, to prevent the enemy from forming a lodgment in that government, which, I am afraid, contains too many perſons diſaffected to the cauſe of liberty and Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. I have alſo wrote to lord Stirling to give him all the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance that he can with the troops under his command, in the continental ſervice, provided it does not interfere with any or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders he may receive from Congreſs relative to them.</p>
                  <p>I hope the Congreſs will approve of my conduct in ſending general Lee on this expedition:—I am ſure I mean it well; as experience teaches us that it is much eaſier to prevent an ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from poſting themſelves, than it is to diſlodge them after they have got poſſeſſion.</p>
                  <p>The evening of the eighth inſtant, a party of our men, under the command of major Knoulton, were ordered to go and burn
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:031423_0062_0FEC4ADDACCF67B0"/>
ſome houſes which lay at the foot of Bunker's-hill, and at the head of Charleſton. They were alſo ordered to bring off the guard, which, we expected, conſiſted, of an officer and thirty men. They croſſed the mill-dam about half after eight o'clock, and gallantly executed their buſineſs,—having burned eight houſes, and brought with them a ſerjeant and four privates of the tenth regiment. There was but one man more there, who making ſome reſiſtance, they were obliged to diſpatch. The gun that killed him was the only one diſcharged by our men, though ſeveral hundred were fired by the enemy from within their works, but in ſo confuſed a manner, that not one of our people was hurt.</p>

                  <p>I AM exceedingly ſorry that I am under the neceſſity of applying to you, and calling the attention of Congreſs to the ſtate of our arms, which is truly alarming. Upon the diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the old army, I was apprehenſive that the new would be deficient in this inſtance: and, that the want might be as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable as poſſible, I gave it out in orders, that the arms of ſuch men as did not re-enliſt (or ſuch of them as were good) ſhould be retained at the prices which ſhould be affixed by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons appointed to inſpect and value them: and, that we might be ſure of them, I added that there would be a ſtoppage of pay for the months of November and December, from thoſe who ſhould carry their firelocks away without their being firſt exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined. I hoped, by theſe precautions, to have procured a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable number: but, ſir, I find with much concern, that from the badneſs of the arms, and the diſobedience of too many in bearing them off without a previous inſpection—very few were collected. Neither are we to expect that many will be brought in by the new recruits, the officers, who are out enliſting, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reported that few men who have arms will enliſt in the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice; and that they are under the diſagreeable alternative of taking men without arms, or of getting none. Unhappy ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and much to be deplored!—eſpecially when we have every reaſon to convince us, that we have to contend with a formidable army, well provided of every neceſſary; and that there will be a moſt vigorous exertion of miniſterial vengeance againſt us, as ſoon as they think themſelves in a condition for
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:031423_0063_0FEC4ADF92AEF580"/>
it. I hope it is in the power of Congreſs to afford us relief:—if it is not, what muſt, what can be done?</p>
                  <p>Our treaſury is almoſt exhauſted, and the demands againſt it very conſiderable. A conſtant ſupply of money, to anſwer every claim and exigency, would much promote the good of the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice. In the common affairs of life, it is uſeful: in war, it is abſolutely neceſſary and eſſential. I would beg leave, too, to remind you of the tents, and their importance;—hoping that if an opportunity has offered, you have procured them. I fear that our army will not be raiſed to the new eſtabliſhment in any reaſonable time, if ever: the enliſting goes on ſo very ſlow, that it almoſt ſeems at an end.</p>
                  <p>In my letter of the fourth inſtant, I wrote you that I had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived certain intelligence from a Mr. Hutchinſon and others, that two of the five regiments from Cork were arrived at Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax, one at Boſton, and the two others had ſailed for Quebec, and had not been heard of. I am now aſſured (as a matter to be relied on) by four captains of ſhips, who left England about the ſecond of November, and who appear to be men of vera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city, that the whole of theſe regiments (except the two com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies that arrived at Boſton ſome time ago), when they ſailed, were at Milford Haven, where they had been obliged to put in, by a violent ſtorm, the nineteenth of October; that they would not be able to leave it for a conſiderable time, as they were under the neceſſity of repairing their veſſels, and getting ſome new ones taken up.—Such is the uncertainty and contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in what I now hear, that it is not poſſible to know what to believe or diſbelieve-</p>
                  <p>I wrote to the general court yeſterday, and to the convention of New-Hampſhire, immediately upon ſeeing the great deficiency in our arms,—praying that they would intereſt themſelves in the matter, and furniſh me with all in their power. Whether I ſhall get any, or what quantity, I cannot determine, not having re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived their anſwers.—The ſame application will be made to the governments of Connecticut and Rhode-Iſland.</p>
                  <p>I do myſelf the honor to ſend you ſundry newſpapers I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the above-mentioned captains, as they may be later than any you have ſeen, and contain ſome intereſting intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>

I wiſh moſt ardently that the urgency of the caſe would have admitted of the delay. I wiſh alſo that the purport of general Schuyler's letter had not, unavoidably as it were, laid me under an indiſpenſable obligation to do it:—for having informed you in his letter (a copy of which he incloſed me) of his dependence on this quarter, for men, I thought you might alſo have ſome reliance on my exertions. This conſideration, added to my fears of the fatal conſequences of delay,—to an information of your having deſigned three thouſand men for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,—to a belief, founded chiefly on general Schuyler's letters, that few or none of them were raiſed,—and to my apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons for New-York, which led me to think that no troops could be ſpared from that quarter,—induced me to loſe not a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's time in throwing in a force there; being well aſſured that general Carleton will improve, to the utmoſt, the advanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges gained, leaving no artifices untried, to fix the Canadians and Indians (who, I find, are too well diſpoſed to take part with the ſtrongeſt) in his intereſt.</p>

                  <p>The Congreſs will pleaſe to obſerve, that the meaſures of ſupporting our poſts in Canada appeared of ſuch exceeding great importance, that the general officers (agreeing with me in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timent,

                  <p>THE commiſſary general being at length [<hi>recovered</hi>] from a long and painful illneſs, I have it in my power to comply with the requiſition of Congreſs, in forwarding an eſtimate of the expenſe attending his office, as alſo that of the quarter-maſter-general.</p>
                  <p>You will pleaſe to obſerve that the commiſſary, by his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the matter, has entered into no ſpecial agreement with any of the perſons he has found occaſion to employ (as thoſe, to whoſe names ſums are annexed, are of their own fixing), but left it to Congreſs to aſcertain their wages. I ſhall ſay nothing therefore on this head, farther than relates to the propoſition of Mr. * * *, to be allowed one-eighth for his trouble and the delivery of the other ſeven-eighths of proviſions, which to me appears exorbitant in the extreme, however conformable it may be to cuſtom and uſage: I therefore think that reaſonable
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:031423_0066_0FEC4AF3572041F0"/>
ſtipends had better be fixed upon. Both the quarter-maſter and commiſſary-generals aſſure me that they do not employ a ſingle perſon uſeleſsly: and as I have too good an opinion of them to think they would deceive me, I believe them.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall take the liberty, in this place, of recommending the expediency, indeed the abſolute neceſſity, of appointing fit and proper perſons to ſettle the accounts of this army. To do it with preciſion, requires time, care, and attention: the longer it is left undone, the more intricate they will be, the more lia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to error, and difficult to explain and rectify;—as alſo the perſons in whoſe hands they are (if diſpoſed to take undue ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage) will be leſs ſubject to detection. I have been as at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive as the nature of my office would admit of, in granting warrants for money on the paymaſter: but it would be abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely impoſſible for me to go into an examination of all the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts incident to this army, and the vouchers appertaining to them, without devoting ſo large a portion of my time to the buſineſs, as might not only prove injurious, but fatal to it in other reſpects. This ought, in my humble opinion, to be the particular buſineſs of a ſelect committee of Congreſs, or one appointed by them, who, once in three months at furtheſt, ſhould make a ſettlement with the officers in the different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partments.</p>
                  <p>Having met with no encouragement from the governments of Maſſachuſetts and New-Hampſhire, from my application for arms and expecting no better from Connecticut and Rhode-Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, I have as the laſt expedient, ſent one or two officers from each regiment into the country, with money to try if they can buy. In what manner they ſucceed, Congreſs ſhall be informed as ſoon as they return.</p>

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther turns out exceedingly mild, inſomuch as to promiſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing favorable from ice,—and no appearance of powder,—I ſhall be able to attempt any thing deciſive, time only can deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. No man upon earth wiſhes more ardently to deſtroy the neſt in Boſton, than I do:—no perſon would be willing to go greater lengths than I ſhall, to accompliſh it, if it ſhall be thought adviſeable. But if we have neither powder to bombard with, nor ice to paſs on, we ſhall be in no better ſituation than we have been in all the year:—we ſhall be worſe, becauſe their works are ſtronger.</p>
                  <p>I have accounts from Boſton, which I think may be relied on, that general Clinton, with about four or five hundred men,
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:031423_0067_0FEC4AF70E22FCF0"/>
hath left that place within theſe four days. Whether this is part of the detachment which was making up (as mentioned in my letter of the fourth inſtant, and then at Nantaſket) or not, is not in my power to ſay. If it is deſigned for New-York or Long-Iſland as ſome think, throwing a body of troops there may prove a fortunate circumſtance. If they go farther ſouth agreeable to the conjectures of others, I hope there will be men to receive them.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding the poſitive aſſertions of the four captains from Portſmouth, noticed in my letter of the fourteenth, I am now convinced from ſeveral corroborating circumſtances,—the accounts of deſerters, and of a lieutenant Hill, of Lord Percy's regiment, who left Ireland the fifth of November, and was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by a privateer from Newburyport,—that the ſeventeenth and fifty-fifth regiments are arrived at Boſton, and other troops at Halifax, agreeable to the information of Hutchinſon and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers. Lieutenant Hill ſays that the tranſports of two regiments only were forced into Milford Haven.</p>
                  <p>Congreſs will think me a little remiſs, I fear, when I inform them that I have done nothing yet towards raiſing the battallions of marines: but I hope to ſtand exculpated from blame, when they hear the reaſon, which was, that already having twenty-ſix incomplete regiments, I thought it would be adding to an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, already-great, in officers, to ſet two entire corps of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers on foot when perhaps we ſhould not add ten men a week by it to our preſent numbers. In this opinion the general offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers have concurred, which induced me to ſuſpend the matter a little longer.—Our enliſtments, for the two laſt weeks, have not amounted to a thouſand men, and are diminiſhing. The regiment for Canada (it is thought) will ſoon be filled, as the men are to chuſe all but their field officers, who are appointed by the court.</p>
                  <p>On ſunday evening, thirteen of the Caghnewaga Indians ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived here on a viſit. I ſhall take care that they be ſo enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained during their ſtay, that they may return impreſſed with ſentiments of friendſhip for us, and alſo of our great ſtrength. One of them is colonel Louis, who honored me with a viſit once before.</p>

                  <p>YOUR favours of the ſixth and twentieth inſtant I received yeſterday, with the ſeveral reſolves of Congreſs alluded to: for which I return you my thanks.</p>
                  <p>Knowing the great importance Canada will be of to us in the preſent intereſting conteſt, and the relief our friends there ſtand in need of, I ſhould be happy, were it in my power to detach a bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>talion from this camp: but it cannot be done. On the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth inſtant, I had the honor to write to you, which will fully convey the reſolutions of a council of war, and the ſentiments of the general officers here, as to the propriety and expediency of ſending troops from theſe lines, for the defence of which we have been and now are obliged to call in the militia;—to which I beg leave to refer you. You may reſt aſſured that my endeavors and exertions ſhall not be wanting, to ſtimulate the governments of Connecticut and New-Hampſhire to raiſe and forward reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as faſt as poſſible; nor in any other inſtance that will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the expedition.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall, in obedience to the order of Congreſs, though inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted by general Howe, propoſe an exchange of governor Skene for Mr. Lovell and family, and ſhall be happy to have an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of putting this deſerving man (who has diſtinguiſhed his fidelity and regard to his country to be too great for perſecution and cruelty to overcome) in any poſt agreeable to his wiſhes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination.</p>
                  <p>I do not know that there is any particular rank annexed to the office of aids-de-camp. Generally they are captains, and rank as ſuch: but higher rank is often given on account of particular me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit and particular circumſtances.—Aids to the king have the rank of colonels.—Whether any diſtinction ſhould be made between thoſe of your commander-in-chief and the other generals, I really know not: I think there ought.</p>
                  <p>You may rely that Conolly had inſtructions concealed in his ſaddle. Mr. * * * who was one of lord Dunmore's family, and another gentleman who wiſhes his name not to be mentioned, ſaw them caſed in tin, put in the tree, and covered over. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably has exchanged his ſaddle, or withdrew the papers when it was mended, as you conjecture. Thoſe that have been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered are ſufficiently bad; but I doubt not of the others being worſe, and containing more diabolical and extenſive plans.—I hope he will be taken proper care of, and meet with rewards equal to his merits.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="70" facs="unknown:031423_0069_0FEC4AFB8C534600"/>
I ſhall appoint officers in the places of thoſe who are in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, as I am fully perſuaded they will wiſh to continue there, for making our conqueſt complete in that quarter.—I wiſh their bravery and valor may be attended with the ſmiles of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune.</p>
                  <p>It gives me great pleaſure to hear of the meaſures Congreſs are taking for manufacturing powder. I hope their endeavors will be crowned with ſucceſs. I too well know and regret the want of it. It is ſcarcely poſſible to deſcribe the diſadvantages an army muſt labor under, when not provided with a ſufficient ſupply of this neceſſary. It may ſeem ſtrange, that, after hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing received about eleven tons, added to about five tons which I found here, and no general action has happened, we ſhould be ſo deficient in this article and require more. But you will pleaſe to conſider, that, beſides its being in its nature ſubject to waſte, and (whilſt the men lay in bad tents) unavoidably da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maged by ſevere and heavy rains (which could not have been prevented, unleſs it had been entirely withdrawn from the men, and an attack hazarded againſt us without ammunition in their hands)—the armed veſſels, our own occaſional firings, and ſome ſmall ſupplies I have been obliged to afford the ſeaport towns threatened with deſtruction,—to which may be added the ſupply to the militia, and going off of the old troops,—have occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, and ever will, a large conſumption of it, and waſte, in ſpite of all the care in the world. The king's troops never have leſs than ſixty rounds a man in their poſſeſſion, independent of their ſtores.—To ſupply an army of twenty thouſand men in this manner, would take near four hundred barrels, allowing noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for ſtores, artillery, &amp;c. I have been always afraid to place more than twelve or fifteen rounds at a time in the hands of our men, leſt, any accident happening to it, we ſhould be leſt deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute, and be undone.—I have been thus particular, not only to ſhew our poverty, but to exculpate myſelf from even a ſuſpicion of unneceſſary waſte.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall inform the paymaſter-general of the reſolution of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs reſpecting his draughts, and the mode and account of them.</p>
                  <p>The companies at Chelſea and Malden are and have always been regimented.—It is not my intention to replace with continental troops the independent companies at Hingham, Weymouth, and Braintree. Theſe places are expoſed, but not more than Cape Ann, Beverly, Salem, Marblehead, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="71" facs="unknown:031423_0070_0FEC4B01C10FBA80"/>
Is it the intention of Congreſs that the officers of the army ſhould pay poſtage?—They are not exempted by the reſolve of the ninth inſtant.</p>
                  <p>The Congreſs will be pleaſed, I have no doubt, to recollect that the five hundred thouſand dollars, now coming, are but little more than enough to bring us up to the firſt day of this month; that to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow will be the laſt of it: and, by their reſolves, the troops are to be paid monthly.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh it was in my power to furniſh Congreſs with ſuch a general as they deſire, to ſend to Canada. Since the unhappy reverſe of our affairs in that quarter, general Schuyler has in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me, that, though he had thoughts of declining the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice before, he would now act. My letter of the eleventh will inform them of general Lee's being at New-York. He will be ready to obey their orders, ſhould they incline to ſend him:—but, if I am not greatly deceived, he or ſome other ſpirited able officer will be wanted there in the ſpring, if not ſooner; as we have undoubted intelligence that general Clinton has ſailed with ſome troops.—The reports of their number are various, from between four and five hundred to nineteen companies of grena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers and light infantry. It is alſo imagined that the regiments, which were to ſail the firſt of December, are intended for that place or Virginia.—General Putnam is a moſt valuable man, and a fine executive officer: but I do not know how he would conduct in a ſeparate department. He is a younger major-general than Mr. Schuyler, who, as I obſerved, having determined to continue in the ſervice, will, I expect, repair into Canada.—A co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of my letter to him, on this and the other ſubjects, I incloſe you, as it will explain my motives for not ſtopping the regiments from theſe governments.</p>
                  <p>When captain Cochran arrives, I will give him every aſſiſtance in my power, in obedience to the orders of Congreſs: but I fear it will be the means of laying up our own veſſels, as theſe people will not bear the diſtinction. Should this be the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, it will be highly prejudicial to us, as we ſometimes pick up their proviſion-veſſels, and may continue to diſtreſs them in this way.</p>
                  <p>Laſt week captain Manly took a ſhip and brig bound to Boſton from Whitehaven, with coals chiefly, and ſome potatoes, for the army. I have for his great vigilance and induſtry, appointed him commodore of our little ſquadron; and he now hoiſts his flag on board the ſchooner Hancock.</p>
                  <p>I congratulate you upon the recovery of Smith, and am ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly glad to hear of the meaſures Congreſs are taking for
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:031423_0071_0FEC4B03F0B1F140"/>
the general defence of the continent. The clouds thicken faſt:—where they will burſt, I know not: but we ſhould be armed at all points.</p>
                  <p>I have not ſucceeded in my applications to theſe govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for arms. They have returned for anſwer, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not furniſh any.—Whether I ſhall be more lucky in the laſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſource left in this quarter, I cannot determine, having not received returns from the officers ſent out to purchaſe of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple. I greatly fear that but very few will be procured in this way, as they are exceedingly ſcarce, and but a ſmall part of what there are, fit for ſervice,—when they make their report you ſhall be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed.</p>
                  <p>The quarter-maſter-general has juſt received from general Schuyler clothing for the ſoldiery, amounting to about ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen hundred pounds York currency. It has come very ſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably, as they are in great want, and will contribute a little to their relief.</p>
                  <p>Since writing the above, I ſaw Mr. * * *, and mentioning that nothing had been found in the tree of Conolly's ſaddle, he told me there had been a miſtake in the matter; that the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were artfully concealed on the two pieces of wood which are on the mail-pillion of his portmanteau-ſaddle; that, by order of lord Dunmore he ſaw them contrived for the purpoſe, the papers put in, and firſt covered with tin, and over that with a waxed canvas cloth.—He is ſo exceedingly pointed and clear in his information, that I have no doubt of its being true.—I could wiſh them to be diſcovered, as I think they contain ſome curious and extraordinary plans.</p>
                  <p>In my letter of the twenty-fourth inſtant, I mentioned the arrival of thirteen of our Caghnewaga friends. They honored me with a talk to-day, as did three of the tribes of the St. John's and Paſmiquoddi Indians;—copies of which I beg leave to incloſe you. I ſhall write to general Schuyler reſpecting the tender of ſervice made by the former, and not to call for their aſſiſtance, unleſs he ſhall at any time want it, or be under the neceſſity of doing it to prevent their taking the ſide of our ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies.</p>
                  <p>I had the honor of writing to you on the nineteenth of No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vember, and then I informed you of having engaged two per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to go to Nova-Scotia on the buſineſs recommended in your letter of the tenth: and alſo that the ſtate of the army would not then admit of a ſufficient force being ſent, for carrying into execution the views of Congreſs reſpecting the dock-yards, &amp;c.—I would now beg leave to mention, that if the perſons,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:031423_0072_0FEC4B05D73B9DD8"/>
ſent for information, ſhould report favorably of the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and practicability of the meaſure; it will not be in my power to detach any men from theſe lines: the ſituation of our affairs will not allow it.—I think it would be adviſable to raiſe them in the eaſtern parts of this government. If it is attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it muſt be by people from the country.—A colonel * * * and a captain * * * have been with me: they think the men neceſſary may be eaſily engaged there, and the meaſure practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable:—provided there are not more than two hundred Britiſh troops at Halifax, they are willing and ready to embark in the matter, upon the terms mentioned in their plan, which I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe you. I would wiſh you to advert to the conſiderations inducing them to the expedition, as I am not without appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, ſhould it be undertaken upon their plan, that the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and guilty will be involved in one common ruin.—I preſume they do not expect to receive more than the five or ten thouſand pounds mentioned in their ſcheme, and to be at every expence.—If we had men to ſpare, it might be undertaken for leſs than either, I conceive.—Perhaps, if Congreſs do not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopt their propoſition, they will undertaken to raiſe men for that particular purpoſe, who may be diſbanded as ſoon as it is effected, and upon the ſame terms that are allowed the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental troops in general.—Whatever may be the determination of Congreſs upon the ſubject, you will pleaſe to communicate it to me immediately: for the ſeaſon moſt favorable for the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpriſe, is advancing faſt; and we may expect in the ſpring that there will be more troops there, and the meaſure be more dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult to execute.</p>

                  <p>THE purport of this letter will be directed to a ſingle ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject:—through you I mean to lay it before Congreſs; and—at the ſame time I beg their ſerious attention to the ſubject,—to aſk pardon for intruding an opinion, not only unaſked, but, in ſome meaſure repugnant to their reſolves.</p>
                  <p>The diſadvantages attending the limited enliſtment of troops are too apparent to thoſe who are eye-witneſſes to them, to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der any animadverſions neceſſary: but to gentlemen at a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, whoſe attention is engroſſed by a thouſand important ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the caſe may be otherwiſe.</p>
                  <p>That this cauſe precipitated the fate of the brave and much-to-be-lamented
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:031423_0073_0FEC4B09BAF4ED10"/>
general Montgomery, and brought on the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat which followed thereupon, I have not the moſt diſtant doubt:—for, had he not been apprehenſive of the troops leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him at ſo important a criſis, but continued the blockade at Quebec, a capitulation (from the beſt accounts I have been a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to collect) muſt inevitably have followed. And that we were not at one time obliged to diſpute theſe lines under diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous circumſtances (proceeding from the ſame cauſe, to wit, the troops diſbanding of themſelves before the militia could be got in), is to me a matter of wonder and aſtoniſhment; and proves that general Howe was either unacquainted with our ſituati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or reſtrained by his inſtructions from putting any thing to a hazard till his reinforcements ſhould arrive.</p>
                  <p>The inſtance of general Montgomery—(I mention it, becauſe it is a ſtriking one:—for a number of others might be adduced)—proves, that, inſtead of having men to take advantage of circumſtances, you are in a manner compelled, right or wrong, to make circumſtances yield to a ſecondary conſideration. Since the firſt of December, I have been deviſing every means in my power to ſecure theſe encampments: and, though I am ſenſible that we never have, ſince that period, been able to act upon the offenſive, and at times not in a condition to defend, yet the coſt of marching home one ſet of men,—bringing in another,—the havoc and waſte occaſioned by the firſt,—the repairs neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the ſecond,—with a thouſand incidental charges and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveniences which have ariſen, and which it is ſcarcely poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble either to recollect or deſcribe,—amount to near as much, as the keeping up a reſpectable body of troops the whole time, ready for any emergency would have done.—To this may be added, that you never can have a well-diſciplined army.</p>
                  <p>To bring men well acquainted with the duty of a ſoldier, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires time. To bring them under proper diſcipline and ſubor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination not only requires time, but is a work of great diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, and in this army where there is ſo little diſtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the officers and ſoldiers, requires an uncommon degree of attention. To expect then the ſame ſervice from raw and undiſciplined recruits as from veteran ſoldiers, is to expect what never did and perhaps never will happen. Men who are familiariſed to danger meet it without ſhrinking; whereas thoſe who have never ſeen ſervice often apprehend danger where no danger is. Three things prompt men to a regular diſcharge of their duty in time of action,—natural bravery,—hope of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,—and fear of puniſhment. The two firſt are common to the untutored and the diſciplined ſoldier: but the latter moſt
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:031423_0074_0FEC4B0EF0C7ABC0"/>
obviouſly diſtinguiſhes the one from the other. A coward, when taught to believe, that, if he breaks his ranks and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dons his colors, he will be puniſhed with death by his own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,—will take his chance againſt the enemy: but a man who thinks little of the one and is fearful of the other, acts from preſent feelings, regardleſs of conſequences.</p>
                  <p>Again men of a day's ſtanding will not look forward: and from experience we find, that, as the time approáchcs for their diſcharge they grow careleſs of their arms, ammunition, camp utenſils, &amp;c. Nay, even the barracks themſelves have felt uncommon marks of wanton depredation, and lay us under freſh trouble and additional expenſe in providing for every freſh ſet, when we find it next to impoſſible to procure ſuch articles as are abſolutely neceſſary in the firſt inſtance. To this may be added the ſeaſoning which new recruits muſt have to a camp, and the loſs conſequent thereupon. But this is not all—Men, engaged for a ſhort limited time only, have the officers too much in their power: for, to obtain a degree of popularity in order to induce a ſecond enliſtment, a kind of familiarity takes place, which brings on a relaxation of diſcipline, unlicenced furloughs, and other indulgences incompatible with order and good government; by which means, the latter part of the time for which the ſoldier was engaged, is ſpent in undoing what you were aiming to inculcate in the firſt.</p>
                  <p>To go into an enumeration of all the evils we have experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in this late great change of the army, and the expences incidental to it,—to ſay nothing of the hazard we have run, and muſt run, between the diſcharging of one army and enliſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of another, unleſs an enormous expenſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

What I have already taken the liberty of ſaying will ſerve to convey a general idea of the matter: and therefore I ſhall, with all due deference, take the freedom to give it as my opinion, that, if the Congreſs have any reaſon to believe that there will be occaſion for troops another year, and conſequently of another enliſtment, they would ſave money, and have infinitely better troops, if they were, even at a bounty of twenty, thirty, or more dollars, to engage the men already enliſted (till January next), and ſuch others as may be wanted to complete the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtment, for and during the war. I will not undertake to ſay that the men can be had upon theſe terms; but I am ſatisfied that it will never do, to let the matter alone, as it was laſt year, till the time of ſervice was nearly expiring. The hazard is too great in the firſt place:—in the next, the trouble and

perplexity of diſbanding one army and raiſing of another at the ſame inſtant, and in ſuch a critical ſituation as the laſt was, is ſcarcely in the power of words to deſcribe, and ſuch as no man, who has experienced it once, will ever undergo again.</p>
                  <p>If Congreſs ſhould differ from me in ſentiments upon this point, I have only to beg that they will do me the juſtice to believe, that I have nothing more in view than what to me ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears neceſſary to advance the public weal, although in the firſt inſtance it will be attended with a capital expence;—and that I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>IN compliance with the reſolves of Congreſs, I have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to general Howe for the exchange of Mr. Lovell. A copy of my letter, and his anſwer thereto, you have incloſed.</p>
                  <p>Captain Watters and captain Tucker, who command two of the armed ſchooners, have taken and ſent into Gloceſter a large brigantine, laden with wood, a hundred and fifty butts for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and forty ſuits of bedding bound from La Have in Nova<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Scotia, for Boſton. She is one of the tranſports in the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterial ſervice. The captain ſays that he was at Halifax, the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth of January, and that general Maſſy was arrived there with two regiments from Ireland.</p>
                  <p>The different prizes were all libelled immediately on the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceipt of the reſolves of Congreſs pointing out the mode; but none of them yet brought to trial, owing to a difference be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the law paſſed in this province, and the reſolutions of Congreſs. The general court are making an amendment to their law, by which the difficulties that now occur will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, as I underſtand it is to be made conformable to your reſolves. The unavoidable delay attending the bringing the captors to trial is grievouſly complained of by the maſters of theſe veſſels, as well as the captors. Many of the former have ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied for liberty to go away without waiting the deciſion,—which I have granted them.</p>
                  <p>I beg leave to recall the attention of Congreſs to their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing a commiſſary in theſe parts, to attend the providing of neceſſaries for the priſoners who are diſperſed in theſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces. Complaints are made by ſome of them, that they are in want of bedding and many other things. As I underſtand that Mr. Franks has undertaken that buſineſs, I wiſh he was ordered to ſend a deputy immediately to ſee that the priſoners
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:031423_0076_0FEC4B10A24C3A48"/>
get what is allowed them by Congreſs; alſo to ſupply the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers with money as they may have occaſion. It would ſave me much time and much trouble.</p>
                  <p>There are yet but few companies of the militia come in. This delay will, I am much afraid, fruſtrate the intention of their being called upon, as the ſeaſon is ſlipping faſt away when they may be of ſervice.</p>
                  <p>The demands of the army were ſo very preſſing before your laſt remittance came to hand, that I was under the neceſſity of borrowing twenty-five thouſand pounds, lawful money from this province. They very cheerfully lent it, an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> paſſed a vote for as much more, if required. I have not repaid the ſum bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowed, as I may ſtand in need of it before the arrival of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other ſupply, which the demands of the commiſſary-general quartermaſter-general, and paying off the arrearages will very ſoon require.</p>
                  <p>Your eſteemed favor of the twenty-ninth ultimo is juſt come to hand. It makes me very happy to find my conduct hath met the approbation of Congreſs. I am entirely of your opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, that, ſhould an accommodation take place, the terms will be ſevere or favorable in proportion to our ability to reſiſt, and that we ought to be on a reſpectable footing to receive their armaments in the ſpring. But how far we ſhall be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with the means, is a matter I profeſs not to know, under my preſent unhappy want of arms, ammunition, and, I may add, men,—as our regiments are very incomplete. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting goes on very ſlow, and will, I apprehend, be more ſo, if for other ſervice the men receive a bounty, and none is given here.</p>
                  <p>I have tried every method I could think of, to procure arms for our men. They really are not to be had in theſe govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments (belonging to the public); and if ſome method is not fallen upon, in the ſouthern governments, to ſupply us, we ſhall be in a diſtreſſed ſituation for want of them. There are near two thouſand men now in camp without firelocks.—I have wrote to the committee of New-York this day, requeſting them to ſend me thoſe arms which were taken from the diſaffected in that government. The Congreſs intereſting themſelves in this requeſt will doubtleſs have a good effect. I have ſent officers into the country, with money to purchaſe arms in the different towns. Some have returned, and brought in a few:—many are ſtill out:—what their ſucceſs will be, I cannot determine.</p>
                  <p>I was in great hopes that the expreſſes, reſolved to be eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed between this place and Philadelphia, would ere now
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:031423_0077_0FEC4B14433F0630"/>
have been fixed. It would, in my opinion, rather ſave than increaſe the expenſe; as many horſes are deſtroyed by one man coming the whole way. It will certainly be more expeditious, and ſafer, than writing by the poſt or private hands, which I am often under the neceſſity of doing.</p>

                  <p>THROUGH you, I beg leave to lay before Congreſs the incloſed letter from Lord Drummond to general Robertſon, which came to my hands a few days ago, in order to be ſent into Boſton.</p>
                  <p>As I never heard of his lordſhip being veſted with power to treat with Congreſs upon the ſubject of our grievances, nor of his having laid any propoſitions before them for an accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, I confeſs it ſurpriſed much, and led me to form va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious conjectures of his motives, and intended application to general Howe and admiral Shuldham for a paſſport, for the ſafe-conduct of ſuch deputies as Congreſs might appoint for ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gociating terms of reconciliation between Great-Britain and us.—Whatever his intentions are, however benevolent his deſigns
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:031423_0078_0FEC4B1AD06D0078"/>
may be, I confeſs that his letter has embarreſſed me much; and I am not without ſuſpicion of its meaning more than <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>th gener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous purpoſes it profeſſes. I ſhould ſuppoſe, that, if the mode for negociation, which he points out, ſhould be adopted (which I hope will never be thought of), it ought to have been fixed and ſettled previous to any application of this ſort; and at beſt, that his conduct in this inſtance is premature and officious, and leading to conſequences of a fatal and injurious nature to the rights of this country. His zeal and deſire, perhaps, of an a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>micable and conſtitutional adjuſtment's taking place may have ſuggeſted and precipitated the meaſure. Be that as it may, I thought it of too much importance, to ſuffer it to go in without having the expreſs direction of Congreſs for that purpoſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and that it was my indiſpenſable duty to tranſmit them the ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal, to make ſuch interpretations and inferences as they may think right.</p>
                  <p>Meſſrs. Willard and Child, who were ſent to Nova-Scotia in purſuance of the reſolve of Congreſs, have juſt returned, and made their report, which I do myſelf the honor to encloſe you. They have not anſwered the purpoſes of their commiſſion by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny means, as they only went a little way into that country, and found their intelligence upon the information of others. You will ſee the reaſons they aſſign in excuſe or juſtification of their conduct, in the report itſelf.</p>
                  <p>Laſt night a party of regulars, ſaid to be about five hundred, landed on Dorcheſter neck, and burned ſome of the houſes there, which were of no value to us; nor would they have been, unleſs we take poſt there; they then might be of ſome ſervice. A detachment went after them as ſoon as the fire was diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but, before it could arrive, they had executed their plan, and made their retreat.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed is a letter for David Franks, eſquire, from Mr. Chamier in Boſton, upon the ſubject of victualling ſuch of the king's troops as may be priſoners within the limits of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract, which I beg the favor of you to deliver him, and that proper agents may be appointed by him, to ſee that it is done. I could wiſh too, that Congreſs would fall upon ſome mode for ſupplying the officers with ſuch money as they may really ſtand in need of, and depute proper perſons for that purpoſe, and furniſhing the privates with ſuch cloathing as may be abſolutely neceſſary. I am applied to, and wearied by their repeated re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. In ſome inſtances I have deſired the committees to give the priſoners within their appointments, what they ſhould judge abſolutely neceſſary for their ſupport,—as the only means
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:031423_0079_0FEC4B1C9A300290"/>
in my power of relieving their diſtreſs,—but I imagine, that, if there were perſons to ſuperintend this buſineſs, their wants would be better attended to, and many exorbitant charges pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented and ſaved to the continent; and the whole would then be brought into a proper account.</p>

                  <p>THE late freezing weather having formed ſome pretty ſtrong ice from Dorcheſter point to Boſton neck, and from Roxbury to the Common, thereby affording a more expanded and conſequently a leſs dangerous approach to the town, I could not help thinking,—notwithſtanding the militia were not all come in, and we had little or no powder to begin our operation by a regular cannonade or bombardment,—that a bold and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute aſſault upon the troops in Boſton with ſuch men as we had (for it could not take many men to guard our own lines at a time when the enemy were attacked in all quarters) might be crowned with ſucceſs: and therefore, ſeeing no certain proſpect of a ſupply of powder on the one hand, and a certain diſſolution of the ice on the other, I called the general officers together, for their opinion, agreeably to the reſolve of Congreſs, of the twenty-ſecond of December.</p>
                  <p>The reſult will appear in the encloſed council of war; and, being almoſt unanimous, I muſt ſuppoſe it to be right; al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though, from a thorough conviction of the neceſſity of attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomething againſt the miniſterial troops before a reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſhould arrive, and while we were favored with the ice, I was not only ready, but willing, and deſirous of making the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſault, under a firm hope (if the men would have ſtood by me) of a favorable iſſue, notwithſtanding the enemy's advantage of ground, artillery, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps the irkſomeneſs of my ſituation may have given dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ideas to me, than thoſe which influenced the gentlemen I conſulted, and might have inclined me to put more to the hazard, than was conſiſtent with prudence:—If it had, I am not ſenſible of it, as I endeavored to give it all the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that a matter of ſuch importance required. True it is, and I cannot help acknowledging, that I have many diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſenſations on account of my ſituation: for, to have the eyes of the whole continent fixed with anxious expectation of hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:031423_0080_0FEC4B1EAA967740"/>
of ſome great event,—and to be reſtrained in every military operation, for want of the neceſſary means of carrying it on,—is not very pleaſing, eſpecially as the means uſed to conceal my weakneſs from the enemy, conceal it alſo from our friends, and add to their wonder.</p>
                  <p>I do not utter this by way of complaint. I am ſenſible that all that the Congreſs could do, they have done; and I ſhould feel moſt powerfully the weight of conſcious ingratitude, were I not to acknowledge this. But as we have accounts of the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of powder in captain Maſon, I would beg to have it ſent on in the moſt expeditious manner: otherwiſe we not only loſe all chance of the benefits reſulting from the ſeaſon, but of the militia, who are brought in at a moſt enormous expence, upon a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption that we ſhould, long ere this, have been amply ſupplied with powder, under the contracts entered into with the committee of Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>The militia, contrary to an expreſs requiſition, are come and coming in without ammunition. To ſupply them alone with twenty-four rounds (which is leſs by three fifths, than the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars are ſerved with) will take between fifty and ſixty barrels of powder; and to complete the other troops to the like quantity, will take near as much more, and leave in ſtore not more than about ſixty barrels, beſides a few rounds of cannon cartridges ready filled for uſe. This, ſir, Congreſs may be aſſured, is a true ſtate of our powder, and will I hope bear ſome teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of my incapacity for action in ſuch a way as may do any eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential ſervice.</p>

                     <hi>February</hi> 21. When I began this letter, I propoſed to have ſent it by expreſs. But recollecting that all my late letters have been as expreſſive of my want of powder and arms as I could paint them, and that Mr. Hooper was to ſet off in a day or two, I thought it unneceſſary to run the continent to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe of an expreſs, merely to repeat what I had ſo often done before, when I am certain that Congreſs, knowing our neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, will delay no time that can poſſibly be avoided in ſupplying them.</p>

                  <p>I HAD the honor of addreſſing you on the eighteenth and twenty-firſt inſtant, by Mr. Hooper; ſince which, nothing ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terial has occurred.</p>
                  <p>We are making every neceſſary preparation for taking poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Dorcheſter heights as ſoon as poſſible, with a view of drawing the enemy out. How far our expectations may be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, time only can determine: but I ſhould think, if any thing would induce them to hazard an engagement, it will be our attempting to fortify theſe heights; as on that event's taking place, we ſhall be able to command a great part of the town, and almoſt the whole harbor, and to make them rather diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than otherwiſe, provided we can get a ſufficient ſupply of what we greatly want.</p>
                  <p>Within theſe three or four days, I have received ſundry ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts from Boſton, of ſuch movements there—(ſuch as taking the mortars, from Bunker's hill,—the putting them, with ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral pieces of heavy ordnance, on board of ſhip, with a quantity of bedding,—the ſhips all taking in water,—the baking a large quantity of biſcuit, &amp;c.)—as to indicate an embarkation of the troops from thence. A Mr. Ides, who came out yeſterday, ſays that the inhabitants of the town generally believe that they are about to remove either to New-York or Virginia, and that every veſſel in the harbor, on Tueſday laſt, was taken up for government's ſervice, and two months' pay advanced them.—Whether they really intend to embark, or whether the whole is a feint, is impoſſible for me to tell. However I have thought it expedient to ſend an expreſs to general Lee, to inform him of it—(in order that he may not be taken by ſurpriſe, if their deſtination ſhould be againſt New-York,)—and continued him on to you. If they do embark, I think the poſſeſſing them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of that place, and of the North river, is the object they have in view, thereby ſecuring the communication with Canada, and rendering the intercourſe between the northern and ſouthern United Colonies exceedingly precarious and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult. To prevent them from effecting their plan, is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of the higheſt importance, and will require a large and reſpectable army, and the moſt vigilant and judicious exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Since I wrote by Mr. Hooper, ſome ſmall parcels of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der have arrived from Connecticut, which will give us a little aſſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>On thurſday night a party of our men at Roxbury made the
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:031423_0082_0FEC4B225D3A1610"/>
enemy's out-centuries, conſiſting of a corporal and two privates, priſoners, without firing a gun or giving the leaſt alarm.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall be as attentive to the enemy's motions as I can, and obtain all the intelligence in my power; and, if I find them embark, ſhall in the moſt expeditious manner detach a part of the light troops to New-York, and repair thither myſelf if cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſhall require it. I ſhall be better able to judge what to do, when the matter happens. At preſent, I can on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſay, that I will do every thing that ſhall appear proper and neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>Your letter of the twelfth inſtant, by colonel Bull, came to hand yeſterday evening: and I ſhall agreeable to your recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, pay proper notice to him.—The ſupply of caſh came very ſeaſonably, as our treaſury was juſt exhauſted, and nothing can be done here without it.</p>

                  <p>ON the twenty-ſixth ultimo I had the honor of addreſſing you, and then mentioned that we were making preparations for taking poſſeſſion of Dorcheſter heights.—I now beg leave to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form you, that a council of general officers having determined a previous bombardment and cannonade expedient and proper, in order to harraſs the enemy and divert their attention from that quarter,—on ſaturday, ſunday and monday nights laſt, we carried them on from our poſts at Coble-<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ill, Leechmore's point, and Lam's-dam. Whether they did the enemy any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable and what injury, I have not yet heard, but have the pleaſure to acquaint you that they greatly facilitated our ſchemes, and would have been attended with ſucceſs equal to our moſt ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine expectations, had it not been for the unlucky burſting of two thirteen, and three ten-inch mortars, among which was the braſs one taken in the ordnance brig. To what cauſe to attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute this misfortune, I know not,—whether to any defect in them, or to the inexperience of the bombardiers. But to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn,—on monday evening, as ſoon as our firing commenced, a conſiderable detachment of our men, under the command of brigadier-general Thomas, croſſed the neck, and took poſſeſſion of the two hills, without the leaſt interruption or annoyance
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:031423_0083_0FEC4B247ABD3F28"/>
from the enemy; and by their great activity and induſtry, before the morning, advanced the works ſo far as to be ſecure againſt their ſhot. They are now going on with ſuch expedition, that in a little time I hope they will be complete, and enable our troops ſtationed there to make a vigorous and obſtinate ſtand.—During the whole cannonade, which was inceſſant the laſt two nights, we were fortunate enough to loſe but two men,—one, a lieutenant, by a cannon ball's taking off his thigh,—the other, a private, by the exploſion of a ſhell, which alſo ſlightly wounded four or five more.</p>
                  <p>Our taking poſſeſſion of Dorcheſter heights is only preparatory to taking poſt on Nuke-hill, and the points oppoſite the ſouth end of Boſton. It was abſolutely neceſſary that they ſhould be previouſly fortified, in order to cover and command them.—As ſoon as the works on the former are finiſhed and complete, meaſures will be immediately adopted for ſecuring the latter, and making them as ſtrong and defenſible as we can. Their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiguity to the enemy will make them of much importance, and of great ſervice to us.</p>
                  <p>As mortars are eſſential, and indiſpenſably neceſſary for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on our operations, and for the proſecution of our plans, I have applied to two furnaces to have ſome thirteen inch ones caſt with all expedition imaginable, and am encouraged to hope, from the accounts I have had, that they will be able to do it. When they are done, and a proper ſupply of powder obtained, I flatter myſelf, from the poſts we have juſt taken and are about to take, that it will be in our power to force the miniſterial troops to an attack, or to diſpoſe of them in ſome way that will be of advantage to us. I think from theſe poſts they will be ſo galled and annoyed, that they muſt either give us battle or quit their preſent poſſeſſions. I am reſolved that nothing on my part ſhall be wanting, to effect the one or the other.</p>
                  <p>It having been the general opinion that the enemy would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to diſlodge our people from the hills, and force their works as ſoon as they were diſcovered, which probably might have brought on a general engagement,—it was thought ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable that the honorable council ſhould be applied to, to order in the militia from the neighboring and adjacent towns. I wrote to them on the ſubject, which they moſt readily complied with: and in juſtice to the militia, I cannot but inform you that they came in at the appointed time, and manifeſted the greateſt alertneſs and determined reſolution to have acted like men engaged in the cauſe of freedom.</p>
                  <p>When the enemy firſt diſcovered our works in the morning,
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:031423_0084_0FEC4B2FB52F95D8"/>
they ſeemed to be in great confuſion, and, from their move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to have intended an attack. It is much to be wiſhed that it had been made: the event, I think, muſt have been fortunate, and nothing leſs than ſucceſs and victory on our ſide, as our officers and men appeared impatient for the appeal, and to have poſſeſſed the moſt animated ſentiments and determined re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution.</p>
                  <p>On tueſday evening a conſiderable number of their troops, embarked on board of their tranſports, and fell down to the caſtle, where part of them landed before dark. One or two of the veſſels got a-ground, and were fired at by our people with a field-piece, but without any damage.—What was the deſign of this embarkation and landing, I have not been able to learn. It would ſeem as if they meant an attack; for it is moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that, if they make one on our works at Dorcheſter at this time, they will firſt go to the caſtle, and come from thence. If ſuch was their deſign, a violent ſtorm that night, and which laſted till eight o'clock the next day, rendered the execution of it impracticable. It carried one or two of their veſſels on ſhore, which have ſince got off.</p>
                  <p>In caſe the miniſterial troops had made an attempt to diſlodge our men from Dorcheſter hills, and the number detached upon the occaſion had been ſo great as to have afforded a probability of a ſucceſsful attack's being made upon Boſton,—on a ſignal given from Roxbury, for that purpoſe, agreeable to a ſettled and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed plan, four thouſand choſen men, who were held in rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dineſs, were to have embarked at the mouth of Cambridge river, in two diviſions, the firſt under the command of briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier-general Sullivan, the ſecond under brigadier-general Greene,—the whole to have been commanded by major-general Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam. The firſt diviſion was to land at the powder-houſe, and gain poſſeſſion of Bacon-Hill and Mount-Horam,—the ſecond at Barton's point or a little ſouth of it, and, after ſecuring that poſt, to join the other diviſion, and force the enemy's gates and works at the neck, for letting in the Roxbury troops. Three floating bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries were to have preceded, and gone in front of the other boats, and kept up a heavy fire on that part of the town where our men were to land.</p>
                  <p>How far our views would have ſucceeded, had an opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty offered for attempting the execution, is impoſſible for me to ſay: nothing leſs than experiment could determine with pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſion. The plan was thought to be well digeſted; and, as far as I could judge from the cheerfulneſs and alacrity which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguiſhed
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:031423_0085_0FEC4B34562D3348"/>
the officers and men who were to engage in the enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, I had reaſon to hope for a favorable and happy iſſue.</p>
                  <p>The militia who were ordered in from the adjacent towns bro't with them three day's proviſion. They were only called upon to act under the idea of an attack's being immediately made, and were all diſcharged this afternoon.</p>
                  <p>I beg leave to remind Congreſs that three major-generals are eſſential and neceſſary for this army; and that, by general Lee's being called from hence to the command in Canada, the left diviſion is without one. I hope they will fill up the vacancy by the appointment of another. General Thomas is the firſt brigadier, ſtands fair in the point of reputation, and is eſteemed a brave and good officer. If he is promoted, there will be a vacancy in the brigadier-generals, which it will be neceſſary to ſupply by the appointment of ſome other gentleman that ſhall be agreeable to Congreſs: But juſtice requires me to mention that William Thompſon, eſquire, of the rifle regiment, is the firſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel in this department, and, as far as I have had an opportunity of judging, is a good officer and a man of courage. What I have ſaid of theſe two gentlemen, I conceived to be my duty, at the ſame time acknowledging, whatever promotions are made will be ſatisfactory to me.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>March</hi> 9.—Yeſterday evening, a captain Irvine, who eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped from Boſton the night before, whith ſix of his crew, came to head-quarters, and gave the following intelligence:—"That our bombardment and cannonade cauſed a great deal of ſurpriſe and alarm in town, as many of the ſoldiery ſaid they never heard or thought we had mortars or ſhells;—that ſeveral of the officers acknowledged they were well and properly directed;—that they made much diſtreſs and confuſion:—that the cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhot, for the greateſt part, went through the houſes; and he was told that one took off the legs and arms of ſix men lying in the barracks on the neck;—that a ſoldier, who came from the lines, there on tueſday morning informed him that twenty men had been wounded the night before; it was reported that others were alſo hurt, and one of the light horſe torn to pieces by the exploſion of a ſhell: (this was afterwards contradicted:)—that, early on tueſday morning, admiral Shuldham, diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vering the works our people were throwing up on Dorcheſter heights, immediately ſent an expreſs to general Howe, to inform him that it was neceſſary they ſhould be attacked and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lodged from thence, or he would be under the neceſſity of with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing the ſhips from the harbor, which were under his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand;—that preparations were directly made for that purpoſe,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:031423_0086_0FEC4B3665659008"/>
as it was ſaid; and, from twelve to two o'clock, about three thouſand men embarked on board the tranſports, which fell down to the caſtle with a deſign of landing on that part of Dor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheſter next to it, and attacking our works on the heights at five o'clock the next morning;—that lord Percy was appointed to command;—that it was generally believed the attempt would have been made, had it not been for the violent ſtorm which happened that night, as I have mentioned before;—that he heard ſeveral of the privates, and one or two ſerjeants, ſay as they were embarking, "that it would be another Bunker's-hill affair."</p>
                  <p>He further informs—"that the army is preparing to leave Boſton, and that they will do it in a day or two;—that the tranſports neceſſary for their embarkation were getting ready with the utmoſt expedition;—that there had been great move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and confuſion among the troops, the night and day pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding his coming out, in hurrying down their cannon, artil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lery and other ſtores, to the wharfs, with the utmoſt precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and they were putting them on board the ſhips in ſuch haſte, that no account or memorandum was taken of them;—that moſt of the cannon were removed from their works, and embarked or embarking;—that he heard a woman ſay, whom he took to be an officer's wife, that ſhe had ſeen men go under the ground at the lines on the neck, without returning;—that the ſhip he commanded was taken up, places fitted, and fitting for officers to lodge, and ſeveral ſhot, ſhells and cannon alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy on board; that the tories were to have the liberty of going where they pleaſe, if they can get ſeamen to man the veſſels, of whom there was a great ſcarcity;—that, on that account, many veſſels could not be carried away, and would be burned;—that many of the inhabitants apprehended the town would be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed; and that it was generally thought their deſtination is Halifax."</p>
                  <p>The account given by captain Irvine, as to the embarkation, and their being about to leave the town, I believe true. There are other circumſtances corroborating; and it ſeems fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by a paper ſigned by four of the ſelectmen of the town, (a copy of which I have the honor to encloſe you,) which was brought out yeſterday evening by a flag, and delivered to colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Learned, by major Baſſet of the tenth regiment, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired it might be delivered me as ſoon as poſſible. I adviſed with ſuch of the general officers upon the occaſion, as I could immediately aſſemble; and we determined it right (as it was not addreſſed to me or any one elſe, nor authenticated by the ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nature
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:031423_0087_0FEC4B3A0F8C6860"/>
nature of general Howe, or any other act obliging him to a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of the promiſe mentioned on his part) that I ſhould give it no anſwer; at the ſame time, that a letter ſhould be returned, as going from colonel Learned, ſignifying his having laid it before me,—with the reaſons aſſigned for not anſwering it.—A copy of this is ſent.</p>
                  <p>To-night I ſhall have a battery thrown up on Nuke-hill (Dorcheſter point) with a deſign of acting as circumſtances may require; it being judged adviſable to proſecute our plans of fortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation as we intended, before this information from the ſelectmen came.</p>
                  <p>It being agreed on all hands that there is no poſſibility of ſtopping them in caſe they determine to go,—I ſhall order look-outs to be kept upon all the head-lands, to diſcover their movements and courſe, and moreover direct commodore Manly and his little ſquadron to dog them, as well for the ſame pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as for picking up any of their veſſels that may chance to depart their convoy. From their loading with ſuch precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy, it is preſumable they will not be in the beſt condition for ſea.</p>
                  <p>If the miniſterial troops evacuate the town and leave it ſtanding, I have thoughts of taking meaſures for fortifying the entrance into the harbor, if it ſhall be thought proper, and the ſituation of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs will admit of it.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding the report from Boſton that Halifax is the place of their deſtination, I have no doubt but they are going to the ſouthward of this,—and, I apprehend, to New-York. Many reaſons lead to this opinion: it is in ſome meaſure corroborated by their ſending an expreſs ſhip there, which, on wedneſday week, got on ſhore and bilged at Cape-Cod. The diſpatches, if written, were deſtroyed when ſhe was boarded. She had a parcel of coal, and about four thouſand cannon ſhot, ſix carriage-guns, a ſwivel or two, and three barrels of powder.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall hold the riflemen and other parts of our troops in readi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to march at a moment's warning, and govern my movements by the events that happen, or ſuch orders as I may receive from Congreſs, which I beg may be ample, and forwarded with all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible expedition.</p>
                  <p>On the ſixth inſtant, a ſhip bound from London, with ſtores for the miniſterial army, conſiſting of coal, porter, and krout, fell in with our armed veſſels, four of them in company, and was carried into Portſmouth. She had had a long paſſage, and of courſe brought no papers of late date. The only letters of
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:031423_0088_0FEC4B3C05D5BA88"/>
importance, or in the leaſt intereſting, that were found, I have incloſed.</p>
                  <p>I beg leave to mention to Congreſs that money is much wanted. The militia from theſe governments, engaged till the firſt of April, are then to be paid: and, if we march from hence, the expenſe will be very conſiderable, muſt be defrayed, and cannot be accompliſhed without it. The neceſſity of making the earlieſt remittance for theſe purpoſes is too obvious, for me to add more.</p>
                  <p>When I wrote that part of this letter which is antecedent to this date, I fully expected it would have gone before now by colonel Bull, not deeming it of ſufficient importance to ſend a ſpecial meſſenger. But he deferred his return from time to time, and never ſet off till to-day. Theſe reaſons I hope will excuſe the delay, and be received as a proper apology for not tranſmitting it ſooner.</p>

                  <p>IN my letter of the ſeventh and ninth inſtant which I had the honor of addreſſing you, I mentioned the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence I had received reſpecting the embarkation of the troop<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> from Boſton; and fully expected, before this, that the town would have been entirely evacuated. Although I have been deceived, and was rather premature in the opinion I had then formed, I have little reaſon to doubt but the event will take place in a very ſhort time, as other accounts which have come to hand ſince, of the ſailing of a great number of tranſports from the harbor of Nantaſket road, and many circumſtances correſponding therewith, ſeem to confirm and render it unqueſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable.</p>
                  <p>Whether the town will be deſtroyed, is a matter of much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certainty: but it would ſeem, from the deſtruction they are making of ſundry pieces of furniture, of many of their waggons, carts, &amp;c. which they cannot take with them as it is ſaid, that it will not: for, if they intended it, the whole might be involved in one general ruin.</p>
                  <p>Holding it of the laſt importance in the preſent conteſt that we ſhould ſecure New-York, and prevent the enemy from poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing it,—and conjecturing they have views of that ſort, and their embarkation to be for that purpoſe,—I judged it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, under the ſituation of things here, to call a council of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:031423_0089_0FEC4B3E2A8018B0"/>
officers to conſult of ſuch meaſures as might be expedient to be taken at this intereſting conjuncture of affairs. A copy of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings I have the honor to encloſe you.</p>
                  <p>Agreeable to the opinion of the council, I ſhall detach the rifle regiment to-morrow, under the command of brigadier-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Sullivan, with orders to repair to New-York with all poſſible expedition; which will be ſucceeded, the day after, by the other five in one brigade,—they being all that it was thought adviſable to ſend from hence till the enemy ſhall have quitted the town. Immediately upon their departure, I ſhall ſend forward major-general Putnam, and follow myſelf with the remainder of the army as ſoon as I have it in my power,—leaving here ſuch a number of men as circumſtances may ſeem to require.</p>
                  <p>As the badneſs of the roads at this ſeaſon will greatly retard the march of our men, I have, by advice of the general officers, wrote to governor Trumbull by this expreſs, to uſe his utmoſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions for throwing a reinforcement of two thouſand men into New-York, from the weſtern parts of Connecticut,—and to the commanding officer there, to apply to the provincial convention or committee of ſafety of New-Jerſey, for a thouſand more for the ſame purpoſe, to oppoſe the enemy and prevent their getting poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, in caſe they arrive before the troops from hence can get there; of which there is a probability, unleſs they are impeded by contrary winds. This meaſure, though it may be attended with conſiderable expenſe, I flatter myſelf, will meet with the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of Congreſs.—Paſt experience, and the lines in Boſton and on Boſton neck, point out the propriety, and ſuggeſt the neceſſity of keeping our enemies from gaining poſſeſſion and making a lodg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Should their deſtination be further ſouthward, or for Hali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fax (as reported in Boſton) for the purpoſe of going into Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da,—the march of our troops to New-York will place them nearer the ſcene of action, and more convenient for affording ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cours.</p>
                  <p>We have not taken poſt on Nuke-hill, and fortified it, as mentioned that we ſhould, in my laſt. On hearing that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my were about to retreat and leave the town, it was thought imprudent and unadviſable to force them with two much preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitation, that we might gain a little time, and prepare for a march. To-morrow evening we ſhall take poſſeſſion, unleſs they are gone.</p>
                  <p>As New-York is of ſuch importance,—prudence and policy require that every precaution that can be deviſed ſhould be
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:031423_0090_0FEC4B4000711920"/>
adopted, to fruſtrate the deſigns which the enemy have of poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. To this end I have ordered veſſels to be provided and held ready at Norwich, for the embarkation and tranſporta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our troops thither. This I have done with a view not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of greatly expediting their arrival (as it will ſave ſeveral day's marching,) but alſo that they may be freſh and fit for intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and throwing up works of defence as ſoon as they get there, if they do not meet the enemy to contend with;—for neither of which would they be in a proper condition after a long and fatiguing march in bad roads. If Wallace, with his ſhips, ſhould be appriſed of the meaſure, and attempt to prevent it by ſtopping up the harbour of New-London, they can but purſue their march by land.</p>
                  <p>You will pleaſe to obſerve that it is the opinion of the general officers, if the enemy abandon the town, that it will be unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to employ or keep any part of this army for its defence; and that I have mentioned, on that event's happening, I ſhall immediately repair to New-York with the remainder of the army not now detached, leaving only ſuch a number of men here as circumſtances may ſeem to require. What I partly allude to, is, that, as it will take a conſiderable time for the removal of ſuch a body of men, and the diviſions muſt precede each other in ſuch order as to allow intermediate time ſufficient for them to be covered and provided for, and many things done pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious to the march of the whole, for ſecuring and forward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch neceſſaries as cannot be immediately carried, and others which may be proper to keep here,—that directions might be received from Congreſs reſpecting the ſame, and as many men ordered to remain for that and other purpoſes, as they may judge proper. I could wiſh to have their commands upon the ſubject, and in time; as I may be under ſome degree of embarraſſment as to their views.</p>
                  <p>Congreſs having been pleaſed to appoint colonel Thompſon a brigadier-general, there is a vacancy for a colonel in the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he commanded, to which I would beg leave to recommend the lieutenant-colonel Hand. I ſhall alſo take the liberty of recommending captain Hugh Stephenſon, of the Virginia, rifle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, to ſucceed colonel Hand, and to be appointed in his place as a lieutenant colonel,—there being no major to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment ſince the promotion of major Magraw to be lieutenant-colonel of one of the Pennſylvania battalions, and who is gone from hence. He is, in my opinion, the fitteſt perſon in this army for it, as well as the oldeſt captain in the ſervice, having diſtinguiſhed himſelf at the head of a rifle company all the laſt

war, and highly merited the approbation of his ſuperior offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>
                  <p>Colonel Mifflin informed me to-day of his having received tent-cloths from Mr. Barrell of Philadelphia, to the amount of ſeven thouſand five hundred pounds Pennſylvania currency, and applied for a warrant for payment of it. But, as our fund is low, and many neceſſary demands againſt it which muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied,—and our calls for money are and will be exceedingly great,—I could not grant it, thinking it might be convenient for payment to be made in Philadelphia, by your order on the treaſury there.</p>

                  <p>IT is with the greateſt pleaſure I inform you, that, on ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day laſt, the ſeventeenth inſtant, about nine o'clock in the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon, the miniſterial army evacuated the town of Boſton, and that the forces of the United Colonies are now in actual poſſeſſion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. I beg leave to congratulate you, ſir, and the honorable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, on this happy event, and particularly as it was effected with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out endangering the lives and property of the remaining unhappy inhabitants.</p>
                  <p>I have great reaſon to imagine their flight was precipitated by the appearance of a work which I had ordered to be thrown up laſt ſaturday night on an eminence at Dorcheſter, which lay neareſt to Boſton neck called Nuke-hill.</p>
                  <p>The town, although it has ſuffered greatly, is not in ſo bad a ſtate as I expected to find it; and I have a particular pleaſure in being able to inform you, ſir, that your houſe has received no dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age worth mentioning. Your furniture is in tolerable order, and the family pictures are all left entire and untouched. Captain Caz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neau takes the charge of the whole, until he ſhall receive further orders from you.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the miniſterial troops had quitted the town, I order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a thouſand men (who had had the ſmall-pox,) under command of general Putnam, to take poſſeſſion of the heights, which I ſhall endeavour to fortify in ſuch a manner as to prevent their return, ſhould they attempt it. But, as they are ſtill in the harbor, I tho't it not prudent to march off with the main body of the army until I ſhould be fully ſatisfied they had quitted the coaſt. I have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore only detached five regiments, beſides the rifle battalion, to
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:031423_0092_0FEC4B4879B51628"/>
New-York, and ſhall keep the remainder here till all ſuſpicion of their return ceaſes.</p>
                  <p>The ſituation in which I found their works evidently diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered that their retreat was made with the greateſt precipita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. They have left their barracks and other works of wood at Bunker's-hill, &amp;c. all ſtanding, and have deſtroyed but a ſmall part of their lines. They have alſo left a number of fine pieces of cannon which they firſt ſpiked up, alſo a very large iron mortar; and, as I am informed, they have thrown another over the end of your wharf. I have employed proper perſons to drill the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, and doubt not I ſhall ſave the moſt of them.—I am not yet able to procure an exact liſt of all the ſtores they have left.—As ſoon as it can be done, I ſhall take care to tranſmit it to you.—From an eſtimate of what the quarter-maſter-general has al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready diſcovered, the amount will be twenty-five or thirty thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds.</p>
                  <p>Part of the powder mentioned in yours of the ſixth inſtant, has already arrived. The remainder I have ordered to be ſtopped on the road, as we ſhall have no occaſion for it here.—The letter to general Thomas, I immediately ſent to him. He deſired leave for three or four days, to ſettle ſome of his private affairs; after which he will ſet out for his command in Canada.—I am happy that my conduct in intercepting lord Drummond's letter is approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of by Congreſs.</p>

                  <p>WHEN I had the honor to addreſs you on the nineteenth inſtant upon the evacuation of the town of Boſton by the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſterial army, I fully expected, as their retreat and embarkation were hurried and precipitate, that, before now, they would have departed the harbor, and been far in their paſſage to the place of their deſtination. But, to my ſurpriſe and diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the fleet is ſtill in Nantaſket road. The purpoſe induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their ſtay is altogetoer unknown: nor can I ſuggeſt any ſatisfactory reaſon for it. On wedneſday night laſt, before the whole of the fleet fell down to Nantaſket, they demoliſhed the caſtle and houſes belonging to it, by burning them down, and the ſeveral fortifications. They left a great number of cannon, but have rendered all of them except a very few, entirely uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, by breaking off the trunnions; and thoſe they ſpiked up:
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:031423_0093_0FEC4B4E80BC1858"/>
but they may be made ſerviceable again:—ſome are already done.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral veſſels in the docks, which were taken by the enemy (ſome with, and others without cargoes,) which dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent perſons claim as their property and right. Are they to be reſtored to their former owners on making proof of their title, or to belong to the continent, as captures made from the enemy?—I wiſh Congreſs would direct a mode of proceeding againſt them, and eſtabliſh a rule for deciſion: they appear to me to be highly neceſſary. In like manner, ſome of the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non which are in Boſton are ſaid to have come from the caſtle. Suppoſing them, with thoſe remaining at the caſtle, to have been purchaſed by and provided originally at the expence of this province,—are they now to be conſidered as belonging to it, or to the public? I beg leave to refer the matter to the opinion of Congreſs, and pray their direction how I am to conduct reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
                  <p>It having been ſuggeſted to me that there was conſiderable property, &amp;c. belonging to perſons who had, from the firſt of the preſent unhappy conteſt, manifeſted an unfriendly and inveter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate diſpoſition, in the town of Boſton, I thought it prudent to write to the honorable general court upon the ſubject, that it might be enquired after and ſecured. A copy of the letter I herewith ſend you, and ſubmit it to Congreſs through you, whether they will not determine how it is to be diſpoſed of, and as to the appropriation of the money ariſing from the ſale of the ſame.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the town was abandoned by the enemy, I judged it adviſable to ſecure the ſeveral heights, leſt they ſhould attempt to return; and, for this purpoſe, have cauſed a large and ſtrong work to be thrown up at Fort-hill, a poſt of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, as it commands the whole harbor, and, when fortified, if properly ſupported, will greatly annoy any fleet the enemy may ſend againſt the town, and render the landing of their troops exceedingly difficult, if not impracticable. This work is almoſt done, and in a little time will be complete: and, that the communication between the town and country may be free and open, I have ordered all the lines upon the neck to be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately deſtroyed, and the other works on the ſides of the town facing the country, that the inhabitants from the latter may not be impeded, and afforded an eaſy entrance, in caſe the enemy ſhould gain poſſeſſion at any future time. Theſe mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters I conceived to be within the line of my duty; of which I adviſed the general court, and recommended to their attention
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:031423_0094_0FEC4B507A96BBC8"/>
ſuch other meaſures as they might think neceſſary for ſecuring the town againſt the hoſtile deſigns of the enemy.</p>
                  <p>I have juſt got an inventory of ſtores and property belonging to the crown, which the enemy left in Boſton, at the caſtle, and Bunker's-hill,—which I have the honor to tranſmit you; and ſhall give ſtrict orders that a careful attention be had to any more that may be found. I ſhall take ſuch precautions re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting them, that they may be ſecure, and turn to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic advantage, as much as poſſible, or circumſtances will admit of.</p>
                  <p>A Mr. Bulfinch from Boſton, who acted as a clerk to Mr. . . . . . ., having put into my hands a lift of rations drawn the ſaturday before the troops evacuated the town, I have incloſed it for your inſpection. He ſays, neither the ſtaff officers nor women are included in the liſt; from which it appears that their number is greater than we had an idea of.</p>
                  <p>Major-general Ward and brigadier general Fyre are deſirous of leaving the ſervice, and, for that purpoſe, have requeſted me to lay the matter before Congreſs that they may be allowed to reſign their commiſſions. The papers containing their applications you will herewith receive. They will give you a full and more particular information upon the ſubject; and therefore I ſhall take the liberty of referring you to them.</p>
                  <p>I would mention to Congreſs that the commiſſary of artillery ſtores has informed me, that whatever powder has been ſent to this camp has always come without any bill aſcertaining the number of caſks or quantity. This it is probable, has proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from forgetfulneſs or inattention in the perſons appointed to ſend it, or the negligence of thoſe who brought it, though they have declared otherwiſe, and that they never had any. As it may in ſome meaſure prevent embezzlements (though I do not ſuſpect any to have been made), and the commiſſary will know what and how much to receive, and be enabled to diſcover miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes if any ſhould happen,—I ſhould be glad if you will direct a bill of parcels to be always ſent in future.</p>
                  <p>There have been ſo many accounts from England, all agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that commiſſioners are coming to America, to propoſe terms for an accommodation, as they ſay,—that I am inclined to think the time of their arrival not very far off.—If they come to Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton (which probably will be the caſe, if they come to America at all) I ſhall be under much embarreſſment reſpecting the manner of receiving them, and the mode of treatment that ought to be uſed. I therefore pray that Congreſs will give me directions, and point out the line of conduct to be purſued,—
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:031423_0095_0FEC477EC83618B8"/>
whether they are to be conſidered as ambaſſadors and to have a paſs or permit for repairing through the country to Philadelphia or to any other place,—or whether they are to be reſtrained in any and what manner. I ſhall anxiouſly wait their orders, and, whatever they are, comply with them literally.</p>

                  <p>I received your favor of the eleventh inſtant by ſaturday night's poſt; and muſt beg pardon for not acknowledging it in my laſt of the twenty-fourth. The hurry I was then in occaſioned the neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and I hope will apologiſe for it.</p>
                  <p>I now beg leave to inform you that I have juſt received in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, that the whole of the miniſterial fleet, beſides three or four ſhips, got under way this evening at Nantaſket road, and were ſtanding out for ſea; in conſequence of which, I ſhall detach a brigade of ſix regiments immediately from hence for New-York, under the command of brigadier-general Sullivan (brigadier-general Heath having gone with the firſt); which will be ſucceeded by another in a day or two; and directly after, I ſhall forward the remainder of the army (except four or five regiments which will be left for taking care of the bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racks and public ſtores, and fortifying the town, and erecting ſuch works for its defence as the honorable general court may think neceſſary)—and follow myſelf.</p>
                  <p>Apprehending that general Thomas will ſtand in need of ſome artilleriſts in Canada, I have ordered two companies of the train to march immediately: and two mortars, with a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of ſhells and ſhot, to be ſent him.—He ſet out on the twenty-firſt inſtant.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed you have a copy of the return of ordnance ſtores left in Boſton by the enemy. In it are not included the cannon left at the caſtle, amounting to a hundred and thirty-five pieces, as reported, all of which, except a very few, they have deſtroyed and rendered uſeleſs, by knocking off the trunnions, and ſpik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up.</p>
                  <p>I beg leave to tranſmit you the copy of a petition from the inhabitants of Nova-Scotia, brought me by * * * eſquire, mentioned therein, who is now here with an Acadian. From this it appears they are in a diſtreſſed ſituation; and, from Mr. * * *'s account, are exceedingly apprehenſive that they will

be reduced to the diſagreeable alternative of taking up arms and joining our enemies, or to flee their country, unleſs they can be protected againſt their inſults and oppreſſions. He ſays that their committees think many ſalutary and valuable conſequences would be derived from five or ſix hundred men being ſent there, as it would not only quiet the minds of the people from the anxiety and uneaſineſs they are now filled with, and enable them to take a part in behalf of the colonies, but be the means of preventing the Indians (of whom there are a good many) from taking the ſide of government, and the miniſterial troops from getting ſuch ſupplies of proviſions <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

I heartily wiſh the money had arrived ſooner, that the militia might have been paid as ſoon as their time of ſervice expired. The diſappoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has given them great uneaſineſs, and they are gone home much diſſatisfied: nor have I been without ſevere complains from th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> other troops, on the ſame account. When I get to New-York, I hope a ſufficient ſum will be there, ready to pay eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry claim.</p>
                  <p>It is not in my power to make report of the deficiency of arms, in compliance with the direction of Congreſs, at this time,
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:031423_0098_0FEC4B5D591C1DA8"/>
as ſome of the regiments are at, and moſt of the other on their march to New-York; nor do I know that it would anſwer any good purpoſe, if it were,—having made repeated applications to the ſeveral aſſemblies and conventions upon the ſubject, and conſtantly received for anſwer, that they could afford no relief.</p>
                  <p>When I arrive at New-York, I ſhall, in purſuance of the order of Congreſs, detach four battalions to Canada, if the ſituation of affairs will admit of it; and ſhall be extremely happy if they and the troops already there can effect the important end of their going.</p>
                  <p>In my letter of the firſt inſtant, per poſt, I incloſed you a copy of a letter from governor Cooke, adviſing me of the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of a ſhip of war, &amp;c. at and near the harbor of Newport. I have now the pleaſure to inform you that the report was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely premature, and without any foundation. You have a copy of his letter of the firſt inſtant to this effect,—I wiſh the alarm had never been given: it occaſioned general Sullivan and his brigade to make an unneceſſary and inconvenient diverſion from their route.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed is a copy of an account, preſented by the honorable general court, of powder furniſhed the continental army by this colony. From the account, it appears that part of it was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied before the army was under my command; and therefore I know nothing of it; but have not the ſmalleſt doubt of the juſtice of the charge. I ſhall leave about two hundred barrels of this article with major-general Ward, out of which Congreſs will direct him to make a return, if they think proper,—and alſo repayment of what may have been furniſhed by the other govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
                  <p>A proclamation of general Howe's, iſſued a few days before his departure from town, having fallen into my hands, I have incloſed you a copy, which will probably have been the occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of large quantities of goods being carried away and the removal of many perſons, which otherwiſe would not have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened.</p>
                  <p>Colonel Warren, paymaſter-general, finding the army likely to be removed from hence, informed me the other day that the ſituation of his affairs and engagements in the buſineſs of the colony are ſuch, as to prevent him from perſonally attendning the army; and offered, in caſe it ſhould be required, to reſign. This was rather embarraſſing. To me it appears indiſpenſably neceſſary that the paymaſter-general, with his books, ſhould be at or near head-quarters, Indeed it is uſual for the head of every department in the army, however diſperſed that army
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:031423_0099_0FEC47A0F80A5428"/>
may be, to be with the commanding general, keeping deputies in the ſmaller departments. On the other hand, colonel War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>'s merit and attachment to the cauſe are ſuch, that I could do nothing leſs than deſire (as ſome money muſt be left for the pay and contingent charges of the army which will remain here), he would wait here till Congreſs ſhall be pleaſed to give their ſentiments upon the matter,—ſending, in the mean time, ſome perſon in whom he could confide, with the money, but little of which there will be to carry, though great the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands, as nine of the regiments which have marched to New-York have only received five hundred pounds each, towards their pay for the months of February and March,—and for others, not a farthing. I hope therefore this matter will be conſidered by Congreſs, and the reſult tranſmitted me as ſoon as done.</p>
                  <p>I would alſo mention to Congreſs that the militia regiments which were laſt called upon, in making up their abſtracts, charged pay,—the officers, from the time they received orders to raiſe companies,—and the privates, from the time they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectively engaged to come or were called upon, though they did not march for a conſiderable time after,—ſome not within three, four, or twenty days, during all which, they remained at home about their own private affairs, without doing any thing elſe than "preparing for the march," as they ſay by way of plea. This appeared to me ſo exceedingly unreaſonable, and ſo contrary to juſtice, that the public ſhould pay for a longer time than from the day of their march to that of their return, that I ordered the abſtracts to be made out accordingly, and refuſed to give warrants on any other terms. They ſay that the enliſting orders, which went out from their governments, give them the pay they claim. The fact may be that ſomething in theſe may ſeem to authoriſe it: but I muſt ſubmit it to Congreſs, and wiſh for their deciſion, whether the continent muſt pay it.—I am, with great eſteem, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>I AM now to inform you that on the fourth inſtant I ſet out from Cambridge, and arrived here on ſaturday laſt. I came through Providence, Norwich, and New-London, in order to ſee and expedite the embarkation of the troops. The third brigade, under the command of general Greene, was at New-London
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:031423_0100_0FEC47A36FF28940"/>
when I left it, where there was a ſufficient number of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports to embark them,—and moſt probably would have arrived here before this, had it not been for a ſevere ſtorm which happened the night they ſailed, which diſperſed them, and, I fear, has done them ſome injury.</p>
                  <p>General Spencer, with the laſt brigade, marched from Rox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury the day I left Cambridge, and would be at New-London, ready to embark in the return tranſports which brought general Sullivan's diviſion to this place. The whole of the troops may be reaſonably expected here in the courſe of this week. The badneſs of the roads, and difficulty of procuri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>g teams for bringing the ſtores, baggage, &amp;c. have greatly prolonged their arrival at this place.</p>
                  <p>I have not had time, ſince I came, to look fully about me; but find many works of defence begun, and ſome finiſhed.—The troops are much diſperſed,—ſome on Long-Iſland, others on Staten-Iſland, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>I have ordered four battalions from hence to Canada, and am taking meaſures to have them forwarded to Albany by wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with all poſſible expedition. This will greatly expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dite their arrival, and eaſe the men of much fatigue. I have wrote general Schuyler of their coming, that he may have neceſſary meaſures taken to hurry their march to general Tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mas.</p>
                  <p>I am informed by general Putnam that the militia, that were called in for the ſupport of this town, in caſe the miniſterial army had arrived before our troops, are all diſcharged, it being unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to keep them longer.</p>
                  <p>All the ſhips of war, beſides the Aſia, moved out of this harbor on ſaturday, and the Aſia yeſterday; ſome of which are now below the Narrows, and the reſt gone to ſea.</p>
                  <p>Your favor of the tenth inſtant, by major Sherburne, directed to general Putnam or the commanding officer here, came to hand on ſaturday evening, with three boxes of money, which I ſhall deliver the paymaſter as ſoon as he arrives, and tranſmit you his receipt for the ſame.</p>
                  <p>Having received information from hence before my depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from Cambridge, that thirty pieces of heavy cannon were wanting, and eſſentially neceſſary for the defence of this place, in addition to thoſe already here,—I took the liberty of apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to admiral Hopkins, whom I ſaw at New-London, for that number, with the mortars and ſtores he brought from Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,—a liſt of which he had tranſmitted you. He told me, that, as many were wanting for the defence of Providence river

                  <p>I HAVE this moment received a letter from general Schuyler, containing incloſures of a very important nature, co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pies of which, I imagine, are contained in the incloſed letter to you, which I thought it my duty immediately to forward by expreſs, that they may be laid before the honorable Congreſs,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:031423_0102_0FEC4B629CFEBAC0"/>
and proper meaſures purſued to prevent the fatal effects which are therein apprehended. For my own part, I have done my utmoſt to forward the four regiments ordered by Congreſs but a variety of incidents have hitherto conſpired to prevent their embarkation. The men had ſcarcely recovered them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the fatigues of their march from Boſton, and are quite unprovided with neceſſaries. The colonels of the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, though repeatedly called upon for that purpoſe, had ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glected making out the abſtracts for their pay. All obſtacles however, are now removed; and I hope to begin the embarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this day. Indeed it would have been beſt, in my opinion, to have ſent the regiments, raiſed in this province and New-Jerſey, upon that ſervice, had not the peculiar circumſtances under which they were raiſed prevented it. By the terms of their enliſtment, they are to ſerve during the war, and at five dollars per month, on condition, (as I am informed) that they ſhall not be ſent out of thoſe provinces. Beſides, they are very ill provided with arms, ſome companies not having any. It muſt be a great burden upon the continent to keep ſuch a number of uſeleſs men in pay: and yet, if they ſhould be diſmiſſed, and an unexpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted ſupply of arms ſhould arrive, it may be ſound very difficult to replace them.</p>
                  <p>The officers of the ſeveral corps that have arrived here have been ſo buſily employed in fixing their men in quarters, that I have not yet been able to procure an exact return of their numbers. Some are yet behind. As ſoon as the whole are collected, I ſhall order the proper returns, and tranſmit them to Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>You will pleaſe to notice what colonel Hazen ſays of the diſpoſition of the Indians. In my opinion, it will be impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to keep them in a ſtate of neutrality. They muſt, and, no doubt, ſoon will take an active part either for or againſt us: and I ſubmit it to the conſideration of Congreſs, whether it would not be beſt immediately to engage them on our ſide, and to uſe our utmoſt endeavors to prevent their minds being poi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned by miniſterial emiſſaries, which will ever be the caſe while a king's garriſon is ſuffered to remain in their country. Would it not therefore be adviſable to ſend a ſufficient force from the back counties of Pennſylvania, to take poſſeſſion of the garriſons of Nia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara and Detroit? This, I think, might eaſily be effected, and would anſwer the moſt ſalutary purpoſes. The Seneca Indians, who have hitherto appeared friendly to us, might be uſefully em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in this buſineſs.</p>

                     </gap> Hazen's letter will be obviated by the appearance of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable committee of Congreſs in Canada, and the forces that have been and will be ſent there.

This cannot be done ſo effectually by conqueſt, as by taking ſtrong hold of the affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and confidence of the inhabitants. It is to be lamented that any conduct of the continental troops ſhould tend to alienate their affections from us.</p>
                  <p>The honorable Congreſs will be able to judge from the papers ſent them by general Schuyler, and information they may receive of the deſigns of the enemy, whether it is expedient to ſend a further reinforcement to Canada.

                  <p>I WAS this day honored with the receipt of your favor of the twentieth inſtant. I have now the pleaſure to acquaint you that the four regiments deſigned for Canada embarked yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday with a fair wind for Albany, under the command of colonels Greaton, Patterſon, Bond, and Poor; beſides which, there was a company of riflemen, a company of artificers, and two engineers,—the whole commanded by brigadier-general Thompſon.</p>
                  <p>I have repeatedly mentioned to the honorable Congreſs the diſtreſsful ſituation we are in for want of arms.—With much pains and difficulty I got moſt of the regiments from the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward tolerably well furniſhed; but find the York regiments very badly provided. Colonel Ritzema's has ſcarcely any: and yet theſe men, being enliſted during the war, and at five dollars per month, ought not (in my judgment) to be diſcharged; as we find it almoſt as difficult to get men, as arms. This is a matter of ſome importance, which I ſhould be glad to receive the particular opinion of Congreſs upon.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Baldwin is one of the aſſiſtant engineers ordered to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada. He is indeed a very uſeful man in this department, but
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:031423_0104_0FEC4B68EA37E838"/>
declined the ſervice, on account of the pay, which he ſays is inadequate to his ſupport. In order to induce him to continue, I promiſed to repreſent his caſe to Congreſs, and would recommend an increaſe of his pay, and that he ſhould have the rank of lieutenant-colonel, of which he is very deſerving. I beg leave therefore to recommend him to Congreſs, and that they would make proviſion for him accordingly.</p>
                  <p>A few days ago, application was made to me by the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee of ſafety for this colony, for an exchange of priſoners. For the particulars I beg leave to refer you to their letter, a copy of which you have incloſed. As there is a ſtanding or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of Congreſs that no ſailors or ſoldiers ſhall be exchanged for citizens, I did not incline to comply with the requeſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the particular direction of Congreſs: but I have been ſince informed, that the priſoners, mentioned in the committee's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as citizens, are really ſeamen taken from private veſſels, but not in arms. How far this may alter the caſe, or how far the reaſons which induced the Congreſs to paſs the reſolve above-mentioned may ſtill exiſt, muſt be left to their determination.</p>
                  <p>The militia, who, on my application were ordered to this place to keep poſſeſſion until I ſhould arrive with the continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal forces, were obliged to return home without their pay, as there was not then money ſufficient in the treaſury for that purpoſe, and to anſwer the exigencies of the army. This occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned great uneaſineſs among them, and may be attended with very bad conſequences in caſe we ſhould have occaſion for their ſervice on any future emergency. I therefore beg the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs would make proviſion for their pay, and point out parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, whether it is to be done by the commander of the continental forces, or by the provincial aſſemblies or conventions from whence they are ſent.</p>
                  <p>As the time for which the riflemen enliſted, will expire on the firſt of July next, and as the loſs of ſuch a valuable and brave body of men will be of great injury to the ſervice, I would ſubmit it to the conſideration of Congreſs, whether it would not be beſt to adopt ſome method to induce them to continue. They are indeed a very uſeful corps; but I need not mention this, as their importance is already well known to the Congreſs. It is neceſſary they ſhould pay an early attention to this matter, as we know from paſt experience, that men are very ſlow in re-enliſting.</p>
                  <p>When I had the honor of ſeeing admiral Hopkins at New-London, he repreſented to me the weak ſtate of his fleet, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by ſickneſs and the damage he received in his engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:031423_0105_0FEC4B6AA4042B48"/>
with the enemy; and requeſted I would ſpare him two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men to aſſiſt him in a deſign he had formed of attacking Wallace. This I readily conſented to; and the men are to be returned as ſoon as the ſervice is performed.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh it was in my power at preſent to furniſh general Lee with the companies of artillery he deſires.—I have already ſent two companies to Quebec; and I have not yet been able to procure a return of thoſe that are here. I expect colonel Knox every moment, and ſhall then be able to determine whether any can be ſpared from hence. Blankets we are in great want of, ourſelves; and it was with great difficulty a few could be procured for the riflemen that were ordered for Canada.</p>
                  <p>I incloſe you Mr. Winthrop's receipt for two hundred thouſand dollars, brought ſome time ago from Philadelphia by major Sherburne, which you will pleaſe to deliver to the continental treaſurers.</p>
                  <p>On my arrival here, I found that Mr. Livingſton had been appointed by the provincial Congreſs, a commiſſary, to furniſh the continental troops ſtationed in this city, with proviſions. I ſuppoſe this was done becauſe there was no continental com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary then on the ſpot. Mr. Livingſton ſtill claims a right of furniſhing all the troops but thoſe lately arrived from Cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge. Mr. Trumbull is now here: and, as I conſider him as the principal in that office, I ſhould be glad to know whether any part of the continental troops is to be furniſhed by any other than their commiſſary-general. I muſt needs ſay, that to me it appears very inconſiſtent, and muſt create great confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in the accounts as well as in the contracts.—I intended to have laid before Congreſs the amount of the rations, as ſupplied by colonel Trumbull and Mr. Livingſton; and called upon thoſe gentlemen to furniſh me with a ſeperate eſtimate for that purpoſe. Colonel Trumbull has given me his, by which it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears he ſupplies the troops at eight pence and one-third per ration. I have not yet received any from Mr. Livingſton; but am informed his contract is at ten pence half-penny. The dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is immenſe, as it will amount to no leſs than two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds per day, for twenty thouſand men. It is indeed to be conſidered that Mr. Livingſton's contract is, including every other charge; and that to Mr. Trumbull's muſt be added ſtore-hire, clerks, and every other contingent expence. But even then it will not amount to ſo much as Mr. Livingſton's, by a penny per ration, which in the groſs, will be ſomething very conſiderable. I thought it my duty, without prejudice or partiality, to ſtate the matter fairly to Congreſs, that they
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:031423_0106_0FEC4B73E07EF840"/>
might take ſuch order upon it as to them ſhall ſeem neceſſary, I cannot, however, in juſtice to Mr. Trumbull, help adding that he has been indefatigable in ſupplying the army; and I believe, from his connections in New-England, is able to do it on as good terms as any perſon in America.</p>
                  <p>The ſeveral matters contained in the foregoing, I muſt beg the early attention of Congreſs to; and that I may be favored with an anſwer as ſoon as poſſible.</p>

                  <p>IN a letter which I had the honor to receive from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs ſome conſiderable time ago, they were pleaſed to aſk what rank aids-de-camp bore in the army? from whence I conclud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that they had adverted to the extraordinary trouble and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement of thoſe gentlemen, with a view to make them an ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate allowance. But nothing being ſince done or ſaid of the matter, I take the liberty,—unſolicited by, and unknown to my aids-de-camp,—to inform your honorable body that their pay is not by any means equal to their trouble and confinement.</p>
                  <p>No perſon wiſhes more to ſave money to the public, than I do: and no perſon has aimed more at it. But there are ſome caſes in which parſimony may be ill placed; and this I take to be one. Aids-de-camp are perſons in whom entire confidence muſt be placed: it requires men of abilities to execute the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties with propriety and diſpatch, where there is ſuch a multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of buſineſs, as muſt attend the commander-in-chief of ſuch an army as ours: and perſuaded I am, that nothing but the zeal of thoſe gentlemen (who live with me, and act in this ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity) for the great American cauſe,—and perſonal attachment to me,—has induced them to undergo the trouble and confinement they have experienced ſince they have become members of my family.</p>
                  <p>I give into no kind of amuſements myſelf; and conſequently thoſe about me can have none, but are confined from morning till eve, hearing and anſwering the applications and letters of one and another, which will now, I expect, receive a pretty conſiderable addition, as the buſineſs of the northern and eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern departments (if I continue here) muſt, I ſuppoſe, paſs through my hands. If theſe gentlemen had the ſame relaxation from duty as other officers have in their common routine, there would not be ſo much in it. But, to have the mind always up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:031423_0107_0FEC4B786DC42FC0"/>
the ſtretch,—ſcarce ever unbent,—and no hours for recrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,—makes a material odds. Knowing this, and at the ſame time how inadequate the pay is, I can ſcarce find inclination to impoſe the neceſſary duties of their office upon them. To what I have here ſaid, this further remark may be made, and is a matter of no ſmall concernment to me, and, in its conſequences, to the public:—and that is, that, while the duty is hard and the pay ſmall, it is not to be wondered at, if there ſhould be found a promptneſs in them to ſeek preferment, or in me to do juſtice to them by facilitating their views; by which means I muſt loſe their aid when they have it moſt in their power to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt me.—Influenced by theſe motives, I have taken the liberty of laying the matter fully, and with all due deference, before your honorable body, not doubting its meeting with a patient hearing.</p>

                  <p>I Received by laſt evening's poſt a letter from Joſhua Wentworth, eſquire, of Portſmouth, whom I had appointed agent for our little fleet in that province. It is dated the fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth inſtant; an extract from which I have the honor of tran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribing for your peruſal.</p>
                  <p>"The third inſtant, commodore Manly brought in the bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantine Elizabeth, one of the third diviſion which ſailed from Nantaſket, with a valuable cargo of Engliſh goods, and a few
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:031423_0108_0FEC4B7A57DF4848"/>
hogſheads of rum and ſugar, by a Mr. J * * *, who was a paſſenger, part freighter, and a very great tory. Suppoſe the cargo worth twenty thouſand pounds ſterling. Thoſe goods are, the greateſt part, owned by the inhabitants of Boſton, and by ſome that were inhabitants when the troops left it,—the reſidue by this Mr. J * * *, and others of the ſame caſt. The complicate ſtate of this prize required my immediate ſetting off for Boſton, expecting I might find ſome directions for my government there; when I waited on general Ward, who was obliging enough to give me his opinion (but not able to direct, having received no inſtructions to the point) that the veſſel and cargo muſt be libelled, and a dividend to the captors would follow, of all ſuch goods as might be legally claimed by the friends to America; and thoſe that were the property of them inimical, might be decreed forfeited. Upon further inquiry, I was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed a reſolve paſſed in Congreſs that all veſſels and goods, retaken previous to a condemnation by a Britiſh court of Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miralty, were liable to a partial decree (by every colony judge) to the captors,—not more than one-third, nor leſs than one-fourth. The preſent prize falls under this reſolve: and any other, that [<hi>makes the</hi>] property of our internal enemies liable to a full confiſcation, may be neceſſary for my government: therefore ſhall be much obliged by your full direction of this capture, and a copy of the continental reſolves thereon. This brigantine is owned by a Mr. Richard Hart of this town, taken on her return from the Weſt-Indies laſt October and carried into Boſton, not condemned. The rum on board are ſeventeen hogſheads,—and four of ſugar, not removed out of her from the time of capture. The other cargo was in general ſtolen by virtue of general Howe's proclamation (which undoubtedly you have ſeen) appointing one C * * * B * * * ſuperintendant, who, by the way, was taken in the prize, and is now confined in the Maſſachuſetts colony, with Mr. J * * * and ſundry others, by order of the general court, to whom general Ward delivered them.</p>
                  <p>"There were a ſerjeant and twelve privates of the fourth, or king's own regiment, taken priſoners on board, with the others, making ſixty-three ſouls.</p>
                  <p>"There appeared from the pillage of this cargo by many of the paſſengers, the property was in him who could ſecret the moſt. For when examining the cheſts and bedding of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners, I found great quantity of goods that they had collected while on board, which were taken out of ware houſes without packing, and hove promiſcuouſly on board the veſſel. Even
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:031423_0109_0FEC4B7CB2C9ADB0"/>
the ſailors had provided for their diſpoſal at pleaſure. In fact, the deſtruction of property under cover of general Howe's proclama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is unparalelled. * * *</p>
                  <p>"I am now diſcharging the cargo, as it is in a periſhing ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation; and, when ſelected, and the regular courſe purſued through the admiralty, ſhall advertiſe agreeable to his excellency's inſtructions to general Ward, who was obliging enough to give me an abſtract.</p>
                  <p>"The general court of this province, finding a difficulty in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king a code of laws for the admiralty court, did not complete that inſtitution their laſt ſeſſion, when they adjourned to June; which lapſe of time will not admit my facilitating the diſpoſal of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes under my care, ſo early as I could wiſh, for the ſafety of part of the intereſt of the Suſanna's cargo, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the porter, which I fear may be ſpoiled by lying ſo long,—it not having equal body to that commonly imported for ſale;—which induces me to deſire your direction for a diſpoſal of that article either at pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate or public ſale."</p>
                  <p>That, ſir, is an exact copy of part of Mr. Wentworth's letter to Mr. Moylan. I now requeſt you will pleaſe to dirct me, in what manner I ſhall inſtruct the agent reſpecting the complicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed cargo, and whether he may be empowered to diſpoſe of the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or any other articles on board the prizes under his care, which the delay of eſtabliſhing the court of admiralty may make liable to periſh.</p>
                  <p>I have not yet heard that there has been any trial of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zes carried into Maſſachuſetts bay. This procraſtination is at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with very bad conſequences. Some of the veſſels I had fitted out are now laid up, the crews being diſſatisfied that they cannot get their prize-money. I have tired the Congreſs upon this ſubject: but the importance of it makes me again mention, that, if a ſummary way of proceeding is not reſolved on, it will be impoſſible to get our veſſels manned. I muſt alſo mention to you, ſir, that captain Manly and his crew are deſirous to know when they may expect their part of the value of the ord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance ſtores taken laſt fall. They are anxious to know what the amount may be. As the inventory of that cargo is in the hands of Congreſs, I would humbly ſubmit it to them, whether a valuation therof ſhould not be made, and the captors' dividend be remitted them as ſoon as poſſible. It will give them ſpirit, and encourage them to be alert in looking out for other prizes.</p>
                  <p>Several officers belonging to the regiments raiſed in theſe middle colonies inform me that their men (notwithſtanding their agreement) begin to murmur at the diſtinction of pay made be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:031423_0110_0FEC4B8132CB72D0"/>
them and the regiments from the eaſtward. I would be glad that the Congreſs would attend to this in time, leſt it may get to ſuch a pitch as will be difficult to ſuppreſs. They argue that they perform the ſame duty, undergo the ſame fatigue, and receive five dollars, when the eaſtern regiments receive ſix dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars and two-thirds per month. For my own part, I wiſh they were all upon the ſame footing: for, if the Britiſh army will not face this way, it will be neceſſary to detach a great part of our troops: in that caſe, I would, for many reaſons, be ſorry there ſhould be any diſtinctions of regiments that are all in the pay of the United Colonies.</p>
                  <p>The deficiency of arms (in the New-York regiments eſpecially) is very great. If I am rightly informed, there are ſcarce as many in colonel Ritzema's regiment as will arm one compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.—Can the Congreſs remedy this evil? If they can, there ſhould not a moment be loſt in effecting it, as our ſtrength at preſent is, in reality, on paper only. Should we think of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging thoſe men who are without arms, the remedy would be worſe than the diſeaſe: for, by vigorous exertions, I hope arms may be procured; and I well know that the raiſing men is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding difficult, eſpecially to be engaged during the continuance of the war, which is the footing on which colonel Ritzema's regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is engaged.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> 26.—I had wrote thus far before I was honored with your favor of the twenty-third inſtant. In obedience to the order therein contained, I have directed ſix regiments more for Canada, which will embark as ſoon as veſſels and other ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries can be provided. Theſe regiments will be command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by general Sullivan. I ſhall give him inſtructions to join the forces in that country under general Thomas, as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to ſending more troops to that country, I am really at a loſs what to adviſe, as it is impoſſible at preſent to know the deſigns of the enemy. Should they ſend the whole force under general Howe up the river St. Laurence to relieve Quebec and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover Canada, the troops gone and now going will be inſufficient to ſtop their progreſs: and ſhould they think proper to ſend that or an equal force this way from Great Britain for the purpoſe of poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſing this city and ſecuring the navigation of Hudſon's river, the troops left here will not be ſufficient to oppoſe them: and yet, for any thing we know, I think it not improbable they may attempt both,—both being of the greateſt importance to them,—if they have men.</p>
                  <p>I could wiſh indeed that the army in Canada ſhould be more
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:031423_0111_0FEC4B85AAA9D448"/>
powerfully reinforced: at the ſame time I am conſcious that the truſting this important poſt (which is now become the grand magazine of America) to the handful of men remaining here, is running too great a riſk. The ſecuring this poſt and Hudſon's river is to us alſo of ſo great importance, that I cannot at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent adviſe the ſending any more troops from hence:—on the contrary, the general officers now here, whom I thought it my duty to conſult, think it abſolutely neceſſary to increaſe the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my at this place with at leaſt ten thouſand men, eſpecially when it is conſidered, that, from this place only, the army in Canada muſt draw its ſupplies of ammunition, proviſions, and, moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably, of men; and that all reinforcements can be ſent from hence much eaſier than from any other place. By the incloſed return, you will ſee the ſtate of the army here, and that the number of effective men is far ſhort of what the Congreſs muſt have expected.</p>
                  <p>I have found it neceſſary to order colonel Dayton's regiment from New-Jerſey, to march as one of the ſix to Canada: where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I muſt recommend it to Congreſs to order two companies of one of the regiments ſtill in Pennſylvania to march to Cape-May, which can be done much ſooner: for, had this deſtination of that regiment not taken place, it would have been very inconvenient to have detached two companies from it to that place; as the march would (according to lord Sterling's and other accounts) have been at leaſt two hundred miles from Amboy, and they muſt have paſſed within twenty miles of Philadelphia, there being no practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable road along the ſea-coaſt of New-Jerſey for their baggage to have paſſed.</p>
                  <p>Dr. Potts, who is bearer hereof, was, I underſtand, appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed director of the hoſpital for theſe middle colonies; but the army being removed, with the general hoſpital, from the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, does in courſe ſupercede him. He is inclined to go to Canada, where he may be very uſeful, if a perſon is not already appointed for that department.—I would humbly beg leave to aſk the Congreſs whether, in all the appointments, it would not be beſt to have but one chief, to whom all the others ſhould be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate.</p>

<pb n="113" facs="unknown:031423_0112_0FEC4B8A11B35B58"/>
time ago by the aſſembly of Rhode-Iſland, which governor Cooke favored me with in the month of January, at the ſame time requeſting me to intereſt myſelf in procuring a body of for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces on the continental eſtabliſhment, for the defence of that colony. I doubt not but the addreſs and the ſubject of it have had the attention and conſideration of Congreſs before now. But if they have not decided upon the matter, I would beg leave to mention that I have made inquiry into the ſituation and condition of the colony, and find it to be as ſtated in the addreſs; and, with all deference to the opinion of Congreſs, conceive it highly neceſſary and expedient that they ſhould adopt ſome meaſures for relieving their diſtreſs, and granting the aid prayed for. The importance of it in the chain of the union,—its extenſive ſea-coaſt, affording harbors for our ſhipping and veſſels, at the ſame time expoſing and ſubjecting the inhabitants to the ravages and depredations of our enemies,—the zeal and attachment which it has ſhewn, and which ſtill actuates it, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the common cauſe,—their incapacity to pay a ſufficient number of men for its defence, ſhould they be able to furniſh them after ſo many engaged in other ſervices;—theſe and many other reaſons which are too obvious to be mentioned, plead power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for the notice and attention of Congreſs, and ſeem to me to claim their ſupport.</p>

                  <p>I AM honored with your favor of the thirteenth ultimo, and obſerve what Congreſs have done reſpecting the ſettlement of the paymaſter's accounts. This ſeems expedient, as he is out of office, and, I am certain, will be attended with but little if any difficulty; nothing more being neceſſary, than to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the warrants with his debts, and the receipts he has given, with his credits. I wiſh every other ſettlement as eaſy, and that a committee was appointed to examine and audit the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:031423_0113_0FEC4B8E81E6D100"/>
upon which the warrants are founded, particularly thoſe of the quarter-maſter and commiſſary-general's. They are long and of high amount, conſiſting of a variety of charges,—of courſe more intricate,—and will require time and an extraordinary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of attention to adjuſt and liquidate in a proper manner.—Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on this ſubject, I did myſelf the honor to write you a conſiderable time ago.</p>
                  <p>Having had ſeveral complaints from the officers in the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern regiments, who have been, and are engaged in recruiting, about the expenſe attending it, and for which they have never yet been allowed any thing, though the officers in theſe go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments have, as I am informed.—I ſhall be glad to know whether the allowance of ten ſhillings, granted to the officers for every man enliſted, by the reſolve of Congreſs in [<hi>January</hi>], is general and indiſcriminate, or confined to the middle diſtricts. If general, muſt I have retroſpect to the time of the reſolves and pay for the ſervices ſince, or only for future enliſtments?</p>
                  <p>In a letter I wrote to Congreſs the twenty-fifth of December, I incloſed one I had received from Jacob Bailey, eſquire, about opening a road from Newbury to Canada. I have received another of the fifteenth ultimo: and, from his account and the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence I have from others upon enquiry, I have no doubt of the practicability of the meaſure; and am well informed that the diſtance will be conſiderably ſhortened, inſomuch that our peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple going from any part of the New-England governments eaſtward of Connecticut-river, to Canada, or returning from thence home, will perform their march in five or ſix days leſs time than by coming or going any way now uſed. Add to this, that the road may be ſo conducted (as it is ſaid) as to go to the river Miſſiſque, from whence the water carriage to St. John's is good, except forty odd miles,—or be carried ſo far to the northward as to keep clear of the lakes altogether, and afford an eaſy paſs into Canada at all ſeaſons. The advantage reſulting from this route being ſo great and important, I have advanced colonel Bailey two hundred and fifty pounds to begin with, and directed him to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute his plan. No doubt it will require a conſiderable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance to accompliſh it: but that will be ſoon ſunk. The expenſe ſaved by taking off ſix days' pay and proviſions from the ſoldiers returning to the eaſtern governments at the expiration of this cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, will be almoſt if not more than equal to the charge incurred in opening it. If not,—as in all probability there will be often a neceſſity for ſending detachments of our troops to Canada from thoſe governments, and for others to return, it will ſoon be repaid.</p>

By a letter from general Schuyler, of the twenty-ſeventh ultimo, I find general Thompſon and his brigade were at Albany; general Sullivan with the laſt (except three or four companies of colonel Wayne's regiment, not yet come) is embarked and gone, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably will be ſoon there. I am apprehenſive, from general Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's account, that they will not proceed with the wiſhed for expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, owing to a difficulty in getting teams and provinder for cattle, neceſſary to carry their baggage, and a ſcarcity of bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teaux at the lakes for ſo large a number, though he is taking the utmoſt pains to procure them. Should they be ſtopped for any time, it will be exceedingly unfortunate, as their going from hence has weakened us here much, and our army in Canada will not be ſtrengthened.</p>
                  <p>I have ſent with the laſt brigade ſixty barrels of powder, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtores and intrenching tools, a ſupply being aſked for; alſo the chain for a boom at the narrows of Richelieu, and the three boxes of money brought by Mr. Hanſon; and have wrote to Mr. Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler to have the boom fixed as ſoon as poſſible.—The commiſſary too has forwarded about eight hundred barrels of pork, and is in expectation of a further quantity from Connecticut, which will go on without ſtopping here.</p>
                  <p>As the magazine from whence the northern and eaſtern ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies will occaſionally receive ſupplies of powder will probably be here, and our ſtock is low and inconſiderable, being much reduced by the ſixty barrels ſent to Canada, I ſhall be glad to have a quantity immediately forwarded. Our ſtores ſhould be great: for if the enemy make an attack upon the town, or at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to go up the North-river, the expenditure will be very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable. Money too is much wanted:—the regiments that are paid have only received to the firſt of April, except thoſe of Pennſylvania and Jerſey which are gone to Canada: they are paid to the laſt of April. By a letter from general Ward, I find his cheſt is juſt exhauſted; the money which was left with him for the payment of the five regiments at Boſton and Bever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, being almoſt expended by large draughts in favor of the commiſſary and quarter-maſter, and in fitting out the armed veſſels.</p>
                  <p>I would here aſk a queſtion, to wit, whether, as Mr. War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren's commiſſion is ſuperceded by Mr. Palfrey's appointment, it will not be neceſſary to fix upon ſome perſon to pay the troops there: or are the payments to go through his hands?—He does not incline to do any thing in the affair without the direction of Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>I have incloſed you a return of the laſt brigade detached, and
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:031423_0115_0FEC4B92DB1F8AE0"/>
alſo of the forces remaining here. And as it is a matter of much importance to know the whole of our ſtrength from time to time, and to ſee it at one view, for regulating our movements with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety; I wiſh it were a direction from Congreſs to the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing officers in the different diſtricts to make monthly returns to the commander-in-chief of the continental army, and of the ſtate of the troops in their departments, and alſo of the military ſtores. Such direction will probably make them more attentive than they other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would be.—I could not get a return of the army in Canada all laſt year.</p>
                  <p>I beg leave to lay before Congreſs a copy of the proceedings of a court-martial upon lieutenant * * * * of the ſecond regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and of his defence,—which I ſhould not have troubled them with, had I not conceived the court's ſentence, upon the facts ſtated in the proceedings, of a ſingular nature, to be by no means adequate to the enormity of his offence, and to be of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding dangerous and pernicious tendency. Upon theſe prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples I thought it my duty to tranſmit the proceedings to them, in order that they may form ſuch a judgment upon the facts ſtated, as they may conceive right and juſt, and advancive of the public good.—At the ſame time I would mention to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs that I think it of material conſequence that they ſhould paſs a reſolve, cutting off the right of ſucceſſion in the military line from one rank to another, which is claimed by many upon the happening of vacancies,—(upon which principle this offence ſeems to have originated in a great meaſure, and the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary judgment in this inſtance to be founded)—declaring that no ſucceſſion or promotion can take place upon any vacancy, without a continental commiſſion giving and authorizing it. It is of much conſequence to check and entirely ſuppreſs this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and claim, which is becoming too prevalent, and has an obvious tendency to introduce mutiny and diſorder;—or, if they conceive the claim good, and that it ſhould take place, that they will declare it ſo, that the point may be ſettled and known in future.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE ſo often and ſo fully communicated my want o arms to Congreſs, that I ſhould not have given them the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of receiving another letter upon this ſubject at this time, but for the particular application of colonel Wayne of Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania,
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:031423_0116_0FEC4B9507AAE018"/>
who has pointed out a method by which he thinks they may be obtained.</p>
                  <p>In the hands of the committee of ſafety at Philadelphia, there are, according to colonel Wayne's account, not leſs than two or three thouſand ſtand of arms for provincial uſe. From hence he thinks a number might be borrowed by Congreſs, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided they are replaced with continental arms as they are brought into the magazine in that city. At a criſis ſo impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant as this, ſuch a loan might be attended with the moſt ſignal advantages,—while the defenceleſs ſtate of the regiments, if no relief can be had, may be productive of fatal conſequences.</p>
                  <p>To give Congreſs ſome idea of our ſituation with reſpect to arms—(and juſtice to my own character requires that it ſhould be known to them, although the world at large will form their opinion of our ſtrength from numbers, without attending to cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances)—it may not be amiſs to incloſe a copy of a return which I received a few days ago from the forts in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, and add, that, by a report from colonel Ritzema's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, of the twenty-ninth ultimo, there appeared to be only ninety-ſeven firelocks and ſeven bayonets belonging thereto: and that all the regiments from the eaſtward are deficient from twenty to fifty of the former. Four of thoſe companies at the fortifications in the Highlands, belong to colonel Clinton's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment; but in what condition the reſidue are on account of arms, and how colonel Wyncoop's men are provided, I cannot undertake to ſay, but am told, moſt miſerably; as colonel Day<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's of New-Jerſey, and colonel Wayne's of Pennſylvania alſo are. This, ſir, is a true, though melancholy deſcription of our ſituation. The propriety therefore of keeping arms in ſtore when men in actual pay are in want of them, and who (it is to be preſumed) will, as they ought, bear the heat and burden of the day, is ſubmitted with all due deference to the ſuperior judgment of others.</p>
                  <p>I cannot by all the enquiries I have been able to make, learn what number of arms have been taken from the tories, where they lie, or how they are to be got at. The committee of ſafety for this colony have aſſured me that no exertions of theirs ſhall be wanting to procure arms: but our ſufferings in the mean time may prove fatal, as men without are in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner uſeleſs. I have therefore thoughts of employing an agent whoſe ſole buſineſs it ſhall be to ride through the middle and interior parts of theſe governments, for the purpoſe of buying up ſuch arms as the inhabitants may incline to ſell, and are fit for uſe.</p>

The deſigns of the enemy are too much behind the curtain for me to form any accurate opinion of their plan of operations for the ſummer's campaign. We are left to wander therefore in the field of conjecture: and as no place (all its conſequences conſidered) ſeemed of more importance in the execution of their grand plan, than poſſeſſing themſelves of Hudſon's river, I thought it adviſable to remove with the continental army to this city as ſoon as the king's troops evacuated Boſton. But if Congreſs, from their knowledge, information, or belief, think it beſt for the general good of the ſervice that I ſhould go to the northward or elſewhere, they are convinced, I hope, that they have nothing more to do than ſignify their commands.</p>

                  <p>At a quarter after ſeven this evening, I received by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs a letter from Thomas Cuſhing, eſquire, chairman of a committee of the honorable general court, covering one to them for the committee of Salem; copies of which I do myſelf the honor to lay before Congreſs, that they may judge of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence contained therein, and direct ſuch meaſures to be taken upon the occaſion as they may think proper and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.</p>
                  <p>I would obſerve, that, ſuppoſing captain Lee's account to be true in part, I think there muſt be a miſtake either in the number of troops or the tranſport ſhips. If there are no more ſhips than what are mentioned, it is certain there cannot be ſo many troops. Of this, however, Congreſs can judge as well as myſelf: and I ſubmit to them, whether, upon the whole of the circumſtances, and the uncertainty of their deſtination (if they were ſeen at all) they chuſe that any forces ſhall be detached from hence, as they will ſee, from the returns tranſmitted yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, that the number of men now here is but ſmall and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderable; and (what is to be regretted) no ſmall part of theſe without arms.—Perhaps, by dividing and ſubdividing our force too much, we ſhall have no one poſt ſufficiently guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall wait their direction: and, whatever their order is, ſhall comply with it as ſoon as poſſible.</p>

                  <p>I AM now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the fourth and ſeventh inſtant, with their ſeveral incloſures, and am exceedingly glad, that before the reſolution reſpecting lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-colonel Ogden came to hand, I had ordered him to join his regiment, and had quelled a diſagreeable ſpirit both of mutiny and deſertion, which had taken place and ſeemed to be riſing to a great degree in conſequence of it. In order to effect it, I had the regiment paraded, and ordered two more at the ſame time under arms, convinced them of their error and ill conduct, and obtained a promiſe for their good behavior in future. To ſuch of the men as had abſconded I gave pardons, on their aſſurances to return to their duty again.</p>
                  <p>In my letter of the fifth inſtant which I had the honor of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing you, I mentioned to Congreſs the refractory and muti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous conduct of lieutenant * * * * of the ſecond regiment, and laid before them a copy of the proceedings of a court-martial upon him, and of his defence, with a view that ſuch meaſures might be adopted as they ſhould think adequate to his crime.—I would now beg leave to inform them, that, ſince then, he has appeared ſenſible of his miſconduct and having made a writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten acknowledgment of his offence, and begged pardon for it (as by the encloſed copy will appear), I thought it beſt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe him from his confinement, and have ordered him to join his regiment; which I hope will meet their approbation, and tender any determination, as to him, unneceſſary;—obſerving at the ſame time that I have endeavored, and I flatter myſelf, not ineffectually, to ſupport their authority, and a due ſubordination in the army, I have found it of importance and highly expedient to yield many points in fact, without ſeeming to have done it,—and this, to avoid bringing on a too frequent diſcuſſion of matters, which, in a political view, ought to be kept a little behind the curtain, and not be made too much the ſubjects of diſquiſition.—Time only can eradicate and overcome cuſtoms and prejudice of long ſtanding: they muſt be got the better of, by ſlow and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual advances.</p>

                     <pb n="120" facs="unknown:031423_0119_0FEC4B9EB97A6E88"/>
I would here take occaſion to ſuggeſt to Congreſs (not wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or meaning of myſelf to aſſume the ſmalleſt degree of power in any inſtance) the propriety and neceſſity of having their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents reſpecting the filling up the vacancies and iſſuing com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions to officers, eſpecially to thoſe under the rank of field officers. Had I literally complied with the directions given upon this ſubject when I firſt engaged in the ſervice, and which I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived to be ſuperceded by a ſubſequent reſolve for forming the army upon the preſent eſtabliſhment, I muſt have employed one clerk for no other buſineſs than iſſuing warrants of appointment, and giving information to Congreſs for their confirmation or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal. It being evident from the neceſſity of the thing, that there will be frequent changes and vacancies in office, from death and a variety of other cauſes, I now ſubmit it to them, and pray their direction whether I am to purſue that mode and all the ceremonies attending it, or to be at liberty to fill up and grant commiſſions at once to ſuch as may be ſit and proper perſons to ſucceed. * * *</p>
                  <p>Before I have done, with the utmoſt deference and reſpect I would beg leave to remind Congreſs of my former letters and applications reſpecting the appointment of proper perſons to ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perintend and take direction of ſuch priſoners as have already fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len and will fall into our hands in the courſe of the war,—being fully convinced, that, if there were perſons appointed who would take the whole management of them under their care, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent would ſave a conſiderable ſum of money by it, and the priſoners be better treated and provided with real neceſſaries than they now are;—and ſhall take the liberty to add that it appears to me a matter of much importance, and worthy of conſideration, that particular and proper places of ſecurity ſhould be fixed on and eſtabliſhed in the interior parts of the different governments for their reception.</p>
                  <p>Such eſtabliſhments are agreeable to the practice and uſage of the Engliſh and other nations, and are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ounded on principles of neceſſity and public utility. The advantages which will a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe from them are obvious and many:—I ſhall only mention two or three.—They will tend much to prevent eſcapes (which are difficult to effect when the public is once advertiſed that the priſoners are reſtrained to a few ſtated and well-known places, and not permitted to go from thence), and the more ingenious among them from diſſeminating and ſpreading their artful and pernicious intrigues and opinions throughout the country, which would influence the weaker and wavering part of mankind, and meet with but too favorable a hearing. Further, it will be leſs
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:031423_0120_0FEC4BA9976DAA58"/>
in their power to join and aſſiſt our enemies in caſes of invaſion, and will give us an opportunity always to know, from the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns of thoſe appointed to ſuperintend them, what number we have in poſſeſſion, the force ſufficient to check and ſuppreſs their hoſtile views in times of emergency, and the expences ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for their maintenance and ſupport. Many other reaſons might be adduced to prove the neceſſity and expediency of the meaſure;—I ſhall only ſubjoin one more, and then have done on the ſubject,—which is, that many of the towns where pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners have been already ſent, not having convenience for or the means of keeping them, complain they are burdenſome; and have become careleſs, inattentive, and altogether indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent whether they eſcape or not; and thoſe of them that are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted to a cloſer confinement (the limits of jail) are neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and not treated with that care and regard which Congreſs wiſh.</p>
                  <p>I have not received further intelligence of the German troops ſince my letter of the ſeventh inſtant, covering Mr. Cuſhing's diſpatches. But, leſt the account of their coming ſhould be true, may it not be adviſable and good policy to raiſe ſome companies of our Germans to ſend among them when they arrive, for exciting a ſpirit of diſaffection and deſertion?—If a few ſenſible and truſty fellows could get with them, I ſhould think they would have great weight and influence with the common ſoldiery, who certainly have no enmity towards us, having received no injury nor cauſe of quarrel from us. The meaſure having occurred, and appearing to me expedient, I thought it prudent to mention it for the conſideration Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>Having received a letter from general Ward, adviſing that Congreſs have accepted his reſignation, and praying to be reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,—and it being neceſſary that a general officer ſhould be ſent to take the command of the troops at Boſton, eſpecially if the army ſhould arrive which is talked of, and which ſome conſider as a probable event.—I muſt beg leave to recommend to Congreſs the appointment of ſome brigadier-generals, not having more here (nor ſo many at this time) than are eſſential to the government and conducting the forces and the works that are carrying on.—Generals Sullivan and Thompſon being ordered to Canada, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſpare one more general officer from hence without injuring the ſervice greatly, and leaving the army here without a ſufficient number.</p>
                  <p>Having frequent application from the committee of ſafety and others, about an exchange of priſoners, and not having au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority to purſue any other mode in this inſtance, than that
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:031423_0121_0FEC4BAB60EF88A8"/>

                  <p>SINCE my laſt of the eleventh inſtant, which I had the honor to addreſs to you, nothing of moment or importance has occurred; and the principal deſign of this is to communicate to Congreſs the intelligence I received laſt night from general Schuyler by a letter of the tenth, reſpecting the progreſs of our troops in getting towards Canada, not doubting of their impatience and anxiety to hear of it and of every thing relating to the expedition. For their more particular information and ſatisfaction, I have done myſelf the pleaſure to extract the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his letter on this head, which is as follows:—"that general Thompſon, with the laſt of his brigade, on the morning of tueſday ſe'nnight, embarked at Fort-George; and, in the evening of the next day, general Sullivan arrived at Albany;—that he had ordered an additional number of carpenters to aſſiſt in building boats; who, finiſhed eight every day, would have a hundred and ten complete by the twenty-firſt, before which he was fearful the laſt of general Sullivan's brigade could not embark;—that they would carry thirteen men each, beſides the baggage, ammunition, and intrenching tools." * * *</p>
                  <p>He alſo informs, "That the ſixty barrels of powder had ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived, and would be forwarded that day; that the firſt regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of general Sullivan's brigade marched that morning; and that the intrenching tools and about ſix hundred barrels of pork were alſo gone on;—that he cannot poſſibly ſend more than half of the three hundred thouſand dollars into Canada, (being greatly in debt on the public account, and the creditors exceedingly clamorous and importunate for payment), which ſum he hopes will be ſufficient, till the Canadians agree to take our paper currency, to which they are mnch averſe, and of which he is exceedingly doubtful:—that he had got the chain, and would forward it that day to general Arnold, with orders to fix it at the rapids of Richelieu." He adds, "that he had
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:031423_0122_0FEC4BAD5BD5A410"/>
reviewed general Sullivan's brigade in preſence of about two hundred and ſixty Indians, who were greatly pleaſed with the order and regularity of the troops, and ſurpriſed at the number, which, the tories had induſtriouſly propagated, conſiſted only of three companies, and that they were always kept walking the ſtreets, to induce them to believe their number was much greater than it really was."</p>
                  <p>I have encloſed a copy of general Schuyler's inſtructions to James Price, eſquire, deputy commiſſary-general, for the regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his conduct in that department, which I received laſt night, and which general Schuyler requeſted me to forward you.—I alſo beg leave to lay before Congreſs, a copy of a letter from Samuel Stringer, director of one of the hoſpitals, purport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an application for an increaſe of ſurgeon's-mates, &amp;c. an eſtimate of which is alſo incloſed; and ſubmit it to them, what number muſt be ſent from hence or got elſewhere. It is highly probable that many more will be wanted in Canada than are already there, on account of the late augmention of the army: but I thought it moſt adviſable to make his requiſition known to Congreſs, and to take their order and direction upon it.—As to the medicines, I ſhall ſpeak to Dr. Morgan (not yet arrived) as ſoon as he comes, and order him to forward ſuch as may be neceſſary and can be poſſibly ſpared.</p>

                  <p>I THIS moment received by expreſs from general Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler an account of the melancholy proſpect and reverſe of our affairs in Canada; and preſuming that the letters which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany this will give Congreſs full information upon the ſubject, I ſhall only add, that general Schuyler, in purſuance of orders from the honorable commiſſioners, has directed brigadier-general Sullivan to halt his brigade; as a further reinforcement (on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the ſcarcity of proviſions) would not relieve, but con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute greatly to diſtreſs our troops already in Canada. Before he received theſe orders, all the brigade, except Dayton's and Wayne's regiments, had left Albany: but I ſuppoſe he will be able to ſtop their march.</p>
                  <p>By my letter of the fifteenth, Congreſs will perceive the quantity of pork already gone from hence: and the commiſſary has aſſured me that he will forward a further ſupply as ſoon as it can be poſſibly collected. I had alſo directed five tons of
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:031423_0123_0FEC4BAF51D3BC68"/>
lead to be ſent to general Schuyler for the Canada expedition, before I received this unfortunate account; which was as much as could be ſpared for the preſent (our ſtock being inconſiderable in proportion to the demand we may reaſonably expect for it); and ſhall do every thing in my power to relieve our affairs from their preſent diſtreſſed and melancholy ſituation in that quarter, which occurs to me and appears neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>I am alſo to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the tenth and thirteenth inſtant, with their ſeveral incloſures. The money, accompanying the letter, came to the paymaſter's hands ſafe.—</p>

                  <p>YOUR favor of the ſixteenth, with ſeveral reſolutions of Congreſs therein incloſed, I had not the honor to receive till laſt night. Before the receipt, I did not think myſelf at liberty to wait on Congreſs, although I wiſhed to do it; and therefore, the more readily aſſented to general Gates's attendance, as I knew there were many matters which could be better explained in a perſonal interview than in whole volumes of letters. He accordingly ſet out for Philadelphia yeſterday morning, and muſt have been too far advanced on his journey (as he propoſed expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion) to be overtaken.</p>

                  <p>I DO myſelf the honor to inform Congreſs that I arrived here yeſterday afternoon about one o'clock, and found all in a ſtate of peace and quiet. I had not time to view the works carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on, and thoſe ordered to be begun when I went away; but have reaſon to believe, from the report of ſuch of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral and other officers as I had the pleaſure to ſee, that they have been proſecuted and forwarded with all poſſible diligence and diſpatch.</p>
                  <p>I am much concerned for the ſituation of our affairs in Canada, and am fearful, ere this, it is much worſe than was firſt reported at Philadelphia. The intelligence from thence, in a letter from captain Wilkinſon of the ſecond regiment, to general Greene, is truly alarming. It not only confirms the account of colonel Bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dle and major Sherburne's defeat, but ſeems to forbode general Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nold's, with the loſs of Montreal.—I have incloſed a copy of the letter, which will but too well ſhew that there is foundation for my apprehenſions.</p>
                  <p>On wedneſday evening I received an expreſs from general Schuyler, with ſundry papers reſpecting ſir John Johnſton, which I have not time to copy, as the poſt is juſt going off, but will do myſelf the honor of tranſmitting you as ſoon as I poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly can.</p>
                  <p>Before I left Philadelphia, I employed a perſon to ſuperintend the building of the gondolas which Congreſs had reſolved on for this this place. He is arrived, and all things ſeem to be in a proper channel for facilitating the work: but when they are done, we ſhall be much in want of guns, having never received any of thoſe taken by commodore Hopkins.</p>
                  <p>Be pleaſed to mention me to Congreſs with the utmoſt reſpect: and I am, ſir, with every ſentiment of regard and eſteem, your and their obedient ſervant,</p>

                  <p>IN my letter of yeſterday which I had the honor of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing you, and which was deſigned to have gone by poſt, but was prevented by his departure at the uſual time, I mentioned my having received by expreſs a letter and ſundry papers from general Schuyler, reſpecting ſir John Johnſton, copies of which I herewith tranſmit you for your inſpection and peruſal. They will ſhew you what meaſures were planned and attempted for apprehending him, and ſecuring the Scotch Highlanders in Tryon county.</p>
                  <p>Having heard that the troops at Boſton are extremely unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy and almoſt mutinous for want of pay (ſeveral months being now due) I muſt take the liberty to repeat a queſtion contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in my letter of the fifth ultimo,—"what mode is to be pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued reſpecting it?" whether is money to be ſent from hence by the paymaſter-general, or ſome perſon ſubordinate to him to be appointed there for that purpoſe?—I expected ſome direction would have been given in this inſtance, long ere this, from what was contained in yours accompanying (or about the time of) the laſt remittance. I preſume it has been omitted by reaſon of the multiplicity of important buſineſs before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</p>
                  <p>In peruſing the ſeveral reſolves you honored me with when at Philadelphia and ſince my return, I find one allowing a chief engineer for the army in a ſeparate department. The ſervice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring many of them, I wiſh Congreſs, if they know any per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons ſkilled in this buſineſs, would appoint them. General Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler has frequently applied, and ſuggeſted the neceſſity of having ſome in Canada.—I myſelf know of none.</p>
                  <p>I alſo find there is a reſolve of the third of June, for taking In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians into the ſervice, which, if literally conſtrued, confines them to that in Canada.—Is that the meaning of Congreſs, or that the commander-in-chief may order their ſervice to any place he may think neceſſary?</p>
                  <p>In reſpect to the eſtabliſhing expreſſes between the ſeveral continental poſts,—who is to do it?—the reſolves does not ſay.—Is it expected by Congreſs that I ſhould?—Whoever the work is aſſigned to, I think ſhould execute it with the utmoſt diſpatch. The late imperfect and contradictory accounts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting our defeat at the Cedars, ſtrongly point out the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity there is for it. No intelligence is yet come from any officer in command there (and moſt probably for want of a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:031423_0127_0FEC4BBBA27A7638"/>
channel to convey it,) though this misfortune happened ſo long ago.</p>
                  <p>When I had the honor of being in Congreſs, if I miſtake not, I heard a reſolve read, or was told of one, allowing the New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>York troops the ſame pay as others in the continental ſervice.—This, if any ſuch, I do not find; and if there is not ſuch a one, I ſhall be under ſome embarraſſment, how to pay the militia to be provided by this province. The reſolve providing them, ſays they are to be paid, while in ſervice, as other troops are. But if thoſe enliſted heretofore in this province are to receive according to the firſt eſtabliſhment, it is a matter of doubt, what the militia are to have.</p>
                  <p>Before this comes to hand, a hand-bill, containing an account of a victory gained by general Arnold over the party that had defeated colonel Biddle and major Sherburne, will moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly have reached you. I have inquired into the authenticity of this fortunate report, and have found there is no dependence to be put in it: nor do I believe it deſerving of the leaſt credit. I ſhall be happy not to hear the reverſe.</p>

                     <p>As the militia will be coming in, and they will be in much need of covering, pleaſe to have all the tents, and cloth proper, for making them that can be procured, forwarded as ſoon as poſſible.</p>

                  <p>I WAS honored yeſterday with your favor of the ſeventh, with its incloſures. When Dr. Potts arrives, I ſhall order him to Canada or Lake-George, as may appear moſt proper. It is certainly neceſſary that he or Dr. Stringer ſhould go to the former.—The reſolves reſpecting general Wooſter's recall I will immediately tranſmit him with directions to repair hither without delay.</p>
                  <p>The ſituation of our affairs in Canada, as reported by the honorable commiſſioners, is truly alarming: and I am ſorry that my opinion of the ill conſequences reſulting from the ſhort enliſtment of the army ſhould be but too well confirmed by the experience they have had of the want of diſcipline and order
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:031423_0128_0FEC4BC25ED599B8"/>
in our ſoldiery there. This induces me again to wiſh Congreſs to determine on a liberal allowance to engage the troops already in ſervice, to re-inliſt for a longer period, or during the continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the war; nor can I forbear expreſſing my opinion of the propriety of keeping the military cheſt always ſupplied with money, as evils of the moſt intereſting nature are often produced for want of a regular payment of troops.—The neglect makes them impatient and uneaſy.</p>
                  <p>I am much ſurpriſed at the ſcarcity of proviſions there, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly of flour; as, from ſeveral accounts I had received from thence, I was led to expect that conſiderable ſupplies of that article could be procured there. That our misfortunes may not become greater, I have wrote to the commiſſary to forward more proviſions, in addition to thoſe already ſent.</p>
                  <p>An adjutant and quarter-maſter-general are indiſpenſably ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, with aſſiſtants. The money ſaved to the continent by their non-appointment will be but ſmall and trifling, when put in competition with the loſs for want of them. Colonel Fleming who acted in the former capacity under general Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery, is now here: but his indiſpoſition is ſuch as to render him unfit, at this time, for the poſt:—it is an important one, and requires vigor and activity to diſcharge the duties of it. He will be of much ſervice to colonel Reed, the buſineſs of whoſe office will increaſe conſiderably by the augmentation of the army.</p>
                  <p>It will be neceſſary, too, that the commiſſaries in Canada, and the deputy quarter-maſter-generals, ſhould have ſeveral aſſiſtants and clerks: nor do I think a preciſe number can be fixed on, as a variety of circumſtances may and muſt occur, to render the number, eſſential for doing the buſineſs in thoſe departments, greater or leſs at different times. It will be better, I apprehend, to leave it indefinite, and with power to the commanding officer to allow ſuch as may be wanted.</p>
                  <p>I am ſtill in the dark, how the unfortunate affair ended at the Cedars, or on what terms the ſurrender was made, as the laſt let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from the commiſſioners has reference to a former, and mentions an agreement entered into, which I have not ſeen: but I know of it more than I could wiſh.</p>
                  <p>I have received from Providence, in conſequence of Mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ris's order, as chairman of the ſecret committee of Congreſs, two hundred and thirty-four muſkets, in part of the two hundred and forty-four directed to be ſent. The incloſed copy of a letter from Mr. Brown, will account for the deficiency.</p>

I ſhall be much obliged by your ordering a quantity of lead and flints to be immediately forwarded; our demands for both are and will be very preſſing. There are alſo wanted ſome particular and neceſſary medicines to complete our hoſpital cheſts, of which I will get Dr. Morgan to furniſh Congreſs with a liſt, when he writes or waits on them about ſome other matters neceſſary to be fixed in his department.</p>
                  <p>As general Wooſter in all probability, will be here in a little time, in compliance with the reſolve of Congreſs and my order tranſmitted to him, I wiſh to know what I am to do with him when he comes.</p>
                  <p>General Schuyler in his letter of the thirty-firſt ultimo, of which I tranſmitted you a copy yeſterday, mentions that ſundry perſons had a deſign to ſeize him as a tory, and probably ſtill have; and wiſhes Congreſs to give him ſome public mark of their approbation, if they are convinced of his zeal and attachment to the cauſe of his country.—Whether he intended that I ſhould communicate his deſire to them, or not, I am not certain; but, ſuppoſing that he did, I muſt beg leave to requeſt that you will lay the paragraph before them, that they may do, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his requiſition, whatever they may judge neceſſary.—</p>

                  <p>SINCE I did myſelf the honor of writing to you yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, I have had the ſatisfaction of ſeeing, and for a few minutes converſing with, Mr. Chaſe and Mr. Carroll from Canada.—Their account of our troops and the ſituation of affairs in that department cannot poſſibly ſurpriſe you more than it has done me. But I need not touch upon a ſubject which you will be ſo well informed of from the fountain-head; nor ſhould I have given you the trouble of a letter by this day's poſt, but for the diſtraction which ſeems to prevail in the commiſſary's depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as well as others in that quarter,—the neceſſity of having it under one general direction,—and the diſſatisfaction of colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Trumbull at the allowance made him by Congreſs as an
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:031423_0130_0FEC4BC9381F2C18"/>
equivalent for his trouble. With reſpect to this particular matter, I can only ſay that I think he is a man well [<hi>calculated</hi>] for the buſineſs, and that, where a ſhilling is ſaved in the pay, a pound may be loſt by miſmanagement in the off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ce; and that his reſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation at this time (I mean this campaign) may poſſibly be atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded with fatal conſequences. I therefore humbly ſubmit to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the propriety of handſomely rewarding thoſe gentlemen who hold ſuch very important, troubleſome, and hazardous offices, as commiſſary and quarter-maſter.</p>
                  <p>In ſpeaking to the former about the ſupplies neceſſary for the troops to be raiſed, he informed me that the quantity of ſalt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions which was ſhipping from hence, might render his attempts to do it precarious; in conſequence of which, I deſired him to lay the matter before the convention of this colony, which he will do this day, but in the mean while deſired Congreſs might be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed of the matter, which I cannot better do than his own words incloſed, and ſubmit the conſideration of it to the wiſdom of that honorable body.</p>
                  <p>To Congreſs I alſo ſubmit the propriety of keeping the two continental battalions (under the command of colonels Shee and M'Gaw) at Philadelphia, when there is the greateſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of a ſpeedy attack upon this place, from the king's troops. The encouragements given by governor Tryon to the diſaffected, which are circulated, no one can well tell how,—the movements of theſe kind of people, which are more eaſy to perceive than deſcribe,—the confident report, which is ſaid to have come immediately from governor Tryon, and brought by a frigate from Halifax, that the troops at that place are em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barking for this,—added to a thouſand incidental circumſtances, trivial in themſelves, but ſtrong from compariſon,—leaves not a doubt upon my mind but that troops are hourly expected at the Hook.</p>
                  <p>I had no doubt, when I left this city for Philadelphia, but that ſome meaſures would have been taken to ſecure the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected and dangerous perſons of this government before now, and left orders for the military to give every aid to the civil power. But the ſubject is delicate, and nothing is done in it. We may therefore have internal as well as external enemies to contend with.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE the honor of tranſmitting to Congreſs a letter which came by expreſs laſt night from general Schuyler, incloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a copy of a letter to him from colonel Kirkland. I have likewiſe incloſed the copy of one directed to general Putnam or the commanding officer at New-York. The repreſentations contained in theſe letters have induced me, without waiting the determination of Congreſs, to direct general Schuyler immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to commence a treaty with the Six Nations, and to engage them in our intereſt, upon the beſt terms he and his colleagues in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion can procure; and I truſt the urgency of the occaſion will juſtify my proceedings to the Congreſs:—the neceſſity for deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and diſpatch in all our meaſures, in my opinion, becomes every day more and more apparent.</p>
                  <p>The expreſs, Mr. Bennet, was overtaken at Albany by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Schuyler, who had received intelligence at Fort-George that a conſiderable body of Mohawk Indians were coming down the Mohawk river under the conduct of ſir John John<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton. The general's extreme hurry would not allow him to write: but it ſeems his intention is to collect at Albany a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient force to oppoſe ſir John. I have given him my opinion that colonel Dayton's regiment ſhould be employed in that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, and to ſecure the poſt where Fort-Stanwix formerly ſtood.</p>
                  <p>In conſequence of an information that ſeveral merchants were exporting ſalt pork and beef from this place, I requeſted the commiſſary to make application to the provincial Congreſs for a reſtraint to be laid on the exportation of thoſe articles, as I apprehended, not only that the enemy might receive ſupplies by the capture of our veſſels, but that our people might ſhortly experience a ſcarcity. The provincial Congreſs have accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly made a reſolution (a copy of which is incloſed) to ſtop the exportation for fourteen days. They expect Congreſs will in the mean time frame ſome general regulations on this head. They are unwilling (they ſay) to ſubject their conſtituents to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial reſtraints.</p>
                  <p>I once mentioned to Congreſs that I thought a war-office, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely neceſſary; and they ſeemed inclined to inſtitute one for our army: but the affair ſeems to be ſince dropped. Give me leave again to inſiſt on the utility and importance of ſuch and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment. The more I reflect upon the ſubject, the more I am convinced of its neceſſity, and that affairs can never be proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly conducted without it.</p>

'Tis with pleaſure I receive the reſolve incloſed in your favor of the eleventh inſtant. One conſiderable ground of diſaffection in in the army is thereby removed.</p>
                  <p>I have employed perſons in building the gondolas and rafts which the Congreſs thought neceſſary for the defence of this place: and, in conjunction with the provincial Congreſs, have determined to ſink chevaux-de-friſe, one of which is already be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun.</p>

                  <p>I Herewith tranſmit you copies of a letter from general Schuyler and its ſeveral incloſures, which I received ſince I had the honor of addreſſing you yeſterday. From theſe you will learn that general Thomas died the ſecond inſtant; and the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of our frontier friends in this colony, that our ſavage foes are meditating an attack againſt them.</p>
                  <p>I muſt beg leave to refer you to a paragraph in the copy of general Schuyler's letter to general Putnam or the command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing officers here, incloſed in mine of the thirteenth, where he requeſts a ſupply of cloathing to be ſent for the army in Canada. As there is but little or no probability of getting it here, I ſhall be glad to know whether there will be any chance of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing it in Philadelphia; and, if it ſhould be ſent through the hands of the quarter-maſter here, to what account it is to be charged.</p>
                  <p>I was laſt evening favored with yours of the eleventh inſtant, and hope the two battalions, which Congreſs have ordered from Philadelphia for the defence of this place, will come provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with arms. If they do not, they will be of no ſervice, as there are more troops here already than are armed.</p>
                  <p>From general Schuyler's letter, he has in view the taking poſt where Fort-Stanwix formerly ſtood. I wrote him, I thought it prudent, previous to that, to ſecure a poſt lower down, about the falls below the German-Flats, leſt the ſava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges ſhould poſſeſs themſelves of the country, and prevent ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of men and proviſions that may be neceſſary to ſend there in future. He ſays he is in want of cannon and ammunition; but has expreſſed himſelf ſo ambiguouſly, that I am at a loſs to know whether he meant what he has ſaid as an application or not,—this being the only intelligence on the ſubject, and the firſt mention of his want. I have deſired him to explain the
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:031423_0133_0FEC4BCF60B52758"/>
matter, and, in his future requiſitions for neceſſaries, to be more certain and explicit as to quantity and quality. In the mean time I ſhall ſend him ſome intrenching tools, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire whether there are any cannon that can be ſpared from hence.</p>

                  <p>I DO myſelf the honor to tranſmit to Congreſs a copy of a letter covering copies of other papers, which I received yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday evening from general Sullivan. The intelligence com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by him is pleaſing and intereſting, and ſuch as muſt afford the greateſt ſatisfaction, if the conduct the Canadians have diſcovered ſince his arrival among them is ingenious and ſincere.</p>
                  <p>General Sullivan mentions his having given commiſſions to ſome of the Canadians as a meaſure founded in neceſſity, and requeſts my approbation of it. But not conſidering myſelf em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered to ſay any thing upon the ſubject, it may not be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper for Congreſs to give him their opinion in this inſtance.</p>
                  <p>I have alſo incloſed copies of General Schuyler's letters re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived at the ſame time. They contain accounts reſpecting the Indians, variant from what was reported by Mr. Kirkland, but amounting to the ſame thing,—the probability of the ſavages at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacking our frontiers.</p>
                  <p>By laſt night's poſt I had information of a capture made by our armed veſſels, of one of the tranſports with a company of High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers on board, bound to Boſton. The incloſed extract from general Ward's letter to me will give you the intelligence more particularly.—There are accounts in the city, mentioning other valuable prizes: but as general Ward has ſaid nothing of them, I fear they want authenticity.</p>
                  <p>I beg leave to mention that a further ſum of money will be wanted for our military cheſt by the time it can be ſent. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed note from the paymaſter-general ſhews the neceſſity for it; and, I may add, beſides his eſtimates of draughts to be made, there are the claims of the eaſtern troops at Boſton, for three or four month's pay, not included, and now due.</p>
                  <p>Colonel Magaw is arrived with part of his battalion; and by wedneſday evening the whole, both of his and colonel Shee's will be here, as I am told.</p>
                  <p>As it is and may be of great importance to have a communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation

with the Jerſeys and Long-Iſland, I have had ſeveral flat-bottomed boats built for the purpoſe, and have thoughts of getting more for Poſaic and Hickinſac rivers where they may be equally neceſſary for tranſporting our army or part of it occaſionally, or ſuccours coming to or going from it.</p>

                  <p>I AM now to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the fourteenth and eighteenth inſtant, and the intereſting reſolves con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them, with which I have been honored. The ſeveral matters recommended to my attention ſhall be particularly regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the directions of Congreſs and your requeſts complied with in every inſtance, as far as in my power.</p>
                  <p>The inſtituting a war-office is certainly an event of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and, in all probability, will be recorded as ſuch in the hiſtoric page. The benefits derived from it, I flatter myſelf, will be conſiderable, though the plan upon which it is firſt formed may not be entirely perfect. This, like other great works, in its firſt edition, may not be free from error:—time will diſcover its defects, and experience ſuggeſt the remedy, and ſuch further improvements as may be neceſſary; but it was right to give it a beginning, in my opinion.</p>
                  <p>The recommendation to the convention of New-York for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraining and puniſhing diſaffected perſons, I am hopeful, will be attended with ſalutary conſequences; and the prohibition againſt exporting proviſions appears to have been a meaſure founded in ſound policy, leſt proper ſupplies ſhould be wanted, wherewith to ſupply our armies.</p>
                  <p>I have tranſmitted general Schuyler the reſolves about the
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:031423_0135_0FEC4BD5B0C2BA20"/>
Indians, and the others on which he is to act; and have requeſted his ſtrict attention and exertions in order to their being carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to execution with all poſſible diſpatch.</p>
                  <p>I note your requeſt reſpecting Mr. Hancock. He ſhall have ſuch directions as may be neceſſary for conducting his office; and I am happy he will have ſo early a remittance for paying the troops in his department.</p>
                  <p>The ſilver and paper money deſigned for Canada will be highly ſerviceable, and I hope will be the means of re-eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing our credit there in ſome degree with the Canadians, and alſo encourage our men too, who have complained in this inſtance. When it arrives, I will ſend it forward under a proper guard.</p>
                  <p>I have communicated to major-general Gates the reſolve of Congreſs for him to prepare to Canada, and directed him to view Point-au-fer, that a fortreſs may be erected if he ſhall judge ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary. He is preparing for his command, and in a few days will take his departure for it. I would fain hope his arrival there will give our affairs a complection different from what they have worn for a long time paſt, and that many eſſential benefits will reſult from it.</p>
                  <p>The kind attention Congreſs have ſhewn to afford the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander-in-chief here every aſſiſtance, by reſolving that recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendatory letters be written to the conventions of New-Jerſey, New-York, and aſſembly of Connecticut, to authoriſe him to call in the militia in caſe of exigency, claims my thankful acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments; and, I truſt, if carried into execution, will produce many advantages in caſe it may be expedient at any time to call in early reinforcements. The delays incident to the ordinary mode may frequently render their aid too late, and prove exceedingly injurious.</p>
                  <p>I this evening received intelligence of the nineteenth inſtant from captain Pond of the armed ſloop Schuyler, of his having taken, about fifty miles from this, on the ſouth ſide of Long-Iſland, a ſhip and a ſloop bound to Sandy-Hook. The ſhip from Glaſgow, with a company of the forty-ſecond regiment, had been taken by one of commodore Hopkins's fleet, who took the ſoldiers out, and ordered her to Rhode-Iſland; after which, ſhe was retaken by the Cerberus, and put under the convoy of the ſloop. As captain Pond informs me, there were five commiſſioned officers, two ladies, and four privates on board. They are not yet arrived at head-quarters.—Incloſed is an invoice of what they have on board.</p>

                  <p>I have been up to view the grounds about Kingſbridge, and find them to admit of ſeveral places well calculated for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence; and, eſteeming it a paſs of the utmoſt importance, have ordered works to be laid out, and ſhall direct part of the two battalions from Pennſylvania to ſet about the execution imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, and will add to their number ſeveral of the milita when they come in, to expedite them with all poſſible diſpatch.</p>
                  <p>Their conſequence, as they will keep open the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the country, requires the moſt ſpeedy completion of them.</p>

                  <p>I WAS this morning honored with your favur of the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth inſtant, with ſundry reſolves of Congreſs, which came to hand after I had cloſed mine of the twentieth. I ſhall ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point a deputy muſter-maſter-general as ſoon as I can fix on a proper perſon for the office, and direct him immediately to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair to Canada.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Bennet, the bearer of this, delivered me a letter to-day from general Schuyler, incloſing the proceedings of the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners of Indian affairs, at a meeting at Albany, in conſequence of the reſolution of Congreſs (as they ſay) which I tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, the ſeventh inſtant, for engaging the Indians in our ſervice. The gentlemen appear to me to have widely miſtaken the views of Congreſs in this inſtance, and to have formed a plan for engaging ſuch Indians as were not in contemplation.—I cannot account upon what principle they have gone, as a part of their proceedings ſhews they are about to hold a conference with the Six Nations. I ſuppoſe they eſteemed what they have done, a neceſſary meaſure;—a copy of which I have the honor to incloſe you.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now beg leave to lay before Congreſs a prepoſition made to me by captain Leary of this city, in behalf of a body of men who are deſirous of being employed in the continental ſervice, as a troop of horſe, and at the ſame time to offer my opinion that ſuch a corps may be extremely uſeful in many re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects. In a march, they may be of the utmoſt ſervice in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>connoitring the enemy and gaining intelligence, and have it in their power to render many important benefits. The terms on
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:031423_0137_0FEC59D75EBB89D8"/>
which they are willing to engage are incloſed, which appear to me moderate and reaſonable.—I am alſo informed that another company might readily be made up, and moſt probably upon the ſame terms. I would therefore ſubmit the propriety and expediency of the meaſure to the conſideration of Congreſs, and wiſh their opinion whether it will be agreeable to them that both or either of them ſhould be formed and incorporated in this army, in manner as has been propoſed by captain Leary, if it can be done.</p>

                  <p>I Herewith tranſmit you an extract of a letter from general Ward, which came to hand by laſt night's poſt, containing the agreeable intelligence of their having obliged the king's ſhips to leave Nantaſket road, and of two tranſports more being taken by our armed veſſels, with two hundred and ten Highland troops on board.</p>
                  <p>I ſincerely wiſh the ſame ſucceſs had attended our arms in another quarter:—but it has not. In Canada, the ſituation of our affairs is truly alarming. The incloſed copies of generals Schuyler, Sullivan, and Arnold's letters will inform you that general Thompſon has met with a repulſe at Three Rivers, and is now a priſoner in the hands of general Burgoyne, who (theſe accounts ſay) is arrived with a conſiderable army. Nor do they ſeem to promiſe an end of our misfortunes here:—it is greatly to be feared that the next advices from thence will be, that our ſhattered, divided and broken army (as you will ſee by the return) have been obliged to abandon the country, and retreat,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:031423_0138_0FEC59DB02D5F7A8"/>
to avoid a greater calamity,—that of being cut off or becoming priſoners.—I will have done upon the ſubject, and leave you to draw ſuch concluſions as you conceive, from the ſtate of facts, are moſt likely to reſult: only adding my apprehenſions that one of the latter events,—either that they are cut off, or become priſoners,—has already happened, if they did not retreat while they had an opportunity. General Schuyler and general Arnold ſeem to think it extremely probable; and if it has taken place, it will not be eaſy to deſcribe all the fatal conſequences that may flow from it. At leaſt our utmoſt exertions will be neceſſary, to prevent the advantages they have gained being turned to our greater misfortunes.—General Gates will certainly ſet out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, and would have gone before now, had he not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to receive ſome particular inſtructions from Congreſs, which colonel Braxton ſaid he imagined would be given and tranſmitted here.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed is a copy of a letter from general Arnold, reſpecting ſome of the Indian tribes, to general Schuyler, and of a talk had at Albany, with thirteen of the Oneidas. They ſeemed then to entertain a friendly diſpoſition towards us, which I wiſh may not be changed by the misfortunes we have ſuſtained in Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada.</p>

                  <p>I THIS morning received by expreſs, letters from generals Schuyler and Arnold, with a copy of one to general Sullivan from the former, and alſo of others to general Sullivan; of all which I do myſelf the honor to tranſmit you copies<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> They will give you a further account of the melancholy ſituation of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs in Canada, and ſhew that there is nothing left to ſave our ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my there but evacuating the country.</p>
                  <p>I am hopeful general Sullivan would retreat from Iſle-aux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noix without waiting for previous orders for that purpoſe; as from general Schuyler's and Arnold's letters, it is much to be feared, by remaining there any conſiderable time, his retreat would be cut off, or at leaſt be a matter of extreme difficulty. I would obſerve to Congreſs that it is not in my power to ſend any carpenters from hence to build the gondolas and gallies general Arnold mentions, without taking them from a work equally neceſſary (if not more ſo) here, of the ſame kind:—and ſubmit it to them whether it may not be adviſable (as it is
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:031423_0139_0FEC59E005068F60"/>
of great importance to us to have a number of thoſe veſſels on the lake, to prevent the enemy's paſſing) to withdraw the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penters for the preſent from the frigates building up the North river, and detach them immediately, with all that can be got at Philadelphia, for that purpoſe and carrying on thoſe here.</p>
                  <p>I have the pleaſure to inform you of another capture made by our armed veſſels, of a tranſport, on the nineteenth inſtant, with a company of Highland grenadiers on board. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed extract of a letter from general Ward, by laſt night's poſt, contains the particulars; to which I beg leave to refer you.</p>
                  <p>I have been honored with your favors of the twenty-firſt and twenty-fifth inſtant in due order, with their important incloſures, to which I ſhall particularly attend.—I have tranſmitted general Schuyler a copy of the reſolve of Congreſs reſpecting the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hickan and Stockbridge Indians, and directed him to put an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſtop to the raiſing the two companies.</p>
                  <p>The quarter-maſter-general has been called upon for ſtopping the tents deſigned for Maſſachuſetts-Bay, and ordered to forward them immediately. He means to write to Congreſs upon the ſubject, and hopes his conduct will not appear to deſerve their reprehenſion. Of this they will judge from his relation of the matter.</p>
                  <p>Being extremely deſirous to forward the intelligence from Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada to Congreſs, well knowing their anxiety about our affairs there, I muſt defer writing upon ſome other matters, I want to lay before them, until the next opportunity, which I hope will be to-morrow, when I will inform them fully upon the ſubject of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, having deſired the commiſſary-general to furniſh me with ſome things neceſſary in that inſtance.</p>

                  <p>UPON information that major * * * was travelling through the country under ſuſpicious circumſtances, I thought it neceſſary to have him ſecured, I therefore ſent after him, he was taken at South-Amboy, and brought up to New-York. Up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on examination he informed me that he came from New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, the country of his uſual abode, where he had left his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; and pretended he was deſtined to Philadelphia on buſineſs with Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>As by his own confeſſion he had croſſed Hudſon's-river at
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:031423_0140_0FEC59E39CC53048"/>
New-Windſor, and was taken ſo far out of his proper and direct route to Philadelphia, this conſideration added to the length of time he had taken to perform his journey,—his being found in ſo ſuſpicious a place as Amboy,—his unneceſſary ſtay there on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of getting ſome baggage from New-York, and an expectation of receiving money from a perſon here, of bad character, and in no circumſtances to furniſh him out of his own ſtock,—the major's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, and his being a half pay officer,—have increaſed my jealouſies about him.</p>
                  <p>The buſineſs, which he informs me he has with Congreſs, is a ſecret offer of his ſervices, to the end that, in caſe it ſhould be rejected, he might have his way left open to an employment in the Eaſt Indies, to which he is aſſigned: and in that caſe he flatters himſelf he will obtain leave of Congreſs to go to Great-Britain.</p>
                  <p>As he had be en put upon his parole by Congreſs, I thought it would be improper to ſtay his progreſs to Philadelphia, ſhould he be infact deſtined thither. I therefore ſend him forward, but (to prevent impoſition) under the care of an officer, with letters found upon him, which, from their tenor, ſeem calculated to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend him to Congreſs.—I ſubmit it to their conſideration, whether it would not be dangerous to accept of the offer of his ſervice.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>IN compliance of the requeſt of Congreſs contained in your favor of the twenty-fifth inſtant, and my promiſe of yeſterday, I do myſelf the honor to inform you the coſt of a ration, according to the commiſſary-general's eſtimate, from the firſt of July to the firſt of December, will be from eight-pence to eight-pence half penny, York currency.</p>
                  <p>Having diſcharged the obligation I was under in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, and finding that many applications have been made for victualling the flying camp, I would, with all poſſible defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, wiſh Congreſs to conſider, the matter well before they come to any determination upon it. Who the gentlemen are that have made offers upon this occaſion, I know not: conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently my objection to their appointment cannot proceed from perſonal diſlike; nor have I it in view to ſerve Mr. Trumbull the commiſſary-general, by wiſhing him to have the direction of the whole ſupplies for his emolument: becauſe
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:031423_0141_0FEC59E52770B9B8"/>
whatever rations are taken from him ſave him the trouble of ſupplying proviſions to the amount, without diminiſhing his pay,—that being fixed and certain:—but what influences me is a regard to the public good. I am morally certain, if the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs is taken out of Mr. Trumbull's hands and put into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's, that it may, and will in all probability, be attended with great and many inconveniencies. It is likely, during the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance of the war between us and Great Britain, that the army here, or part of it, and the troops compoſing the flying camp, will be frequently joined, and under the neceſſity of affording each other mutual aid. If this event is probable (and moſt certainly it is), the ſame confuſion and diſorder will reſult from having two commiſſaries, or one commiſſary and one contractor in the ſame army in the ſame department, as did between Mr. Trumbull and Mr. Livingſton on the coming of the former to New-York. I cannot diſcriminate the two caſes; and not foreſeeing that any good conſequences will flow from the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but that many bad ones will,—ſuch as claſhing of inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts,—a contention for ſtores, carriages,—and many other cauſes that might be mentioned if hurry of buſineſs would permit,—I confeſs I cannot perceive the propriety of appointing a different perſon, or any but the commiſſary.</p>
                  <p>I would alſo add, that few armies, if any, have been better ſupplied than the troops under Mr. Trumbull's care in this inſtance; which, I ſhould ſuppoſe, ought to have conſiderable weight, eſpecially as we have ſtrong reaſons to believe that a large ſhare of the misfortunes our arms have ſuſtained in Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, ſprang from a want of proper and neceſſary ſupplies of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Trumbull too (I am informed) has already made provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion in New-Jerſey for the flying camp which will be ſtationed there, and employed proper perſons in that colony to tranſact the buſineſs incident to his department, in obedience to my orders, and in full confidence that it was to come under his ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement.</p>
                  <p>My great deſire to ſee the affairs of this important poſt, on which ſo much depends, go on in an eaſy, ſmooth and unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted courſe, has led me to ſay thus much upon the ſubject, and will, I hope (if I am unhappy enough to differ in opinion with Congreſs), plead my excuſe for the liberty I have taken.</p>
                  <p>I would alſo beg leave to mention to congreſs the neceſſity there is of ſome new regulations being entered into, reſpecting the chaplains of this army. They will remember that appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations were made to increaſe their pay, which was conceived
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:031423_0142_0FEC59E6B5868B90"/>
too low for their ſupport; and that it was propoſed (if it could not be done for the whole) that the number ſhould be leſſened, and one be appointed to two regiments, with an additional al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance. This latter expedient was adopted, and, while the army continued all together at one encampment, anſwered well, or at leaſt did not produce many inconveniences. But the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my now being differently circumſtanced from what it then was,—part here, part at Boſton, and a third part detached to Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada,—has introduced much confuſion and diſorder in this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance; nor do I know how it is poſſible to remedy the evil, but by affixing one to each regiment, with ſalaries competent to their ſupport. No ſhifting, no change from one regiment to another can anſwer the purpoſe; and in many caſes it could never be done though the regiments ſhould conſent,—as where detachments are compoſed of unequal numbers, or ordered from different poſts. Many more inconveniencies might be pointed out: but theſe, it is preſumed, will ſufficiently ſhew the defect of the preſent eſtabliſhment, and the propriety of an alteration. What that alteration ſhall be, Congreſs will pleaſe to determine.</p>
                  <p>Congreſs, I doubt not, will have heard of the plot, that was forming among many diſaffected perſons in this city and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for aiding the king's troops upon their arrival. No regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar plan ſeems to have been digeſted; but ſeveral perſons have been enliſted, and ſworn to join them. The matter, I am in hopes, by a timely diſcovery, will be ſuppreſſed and put a ſtop to. Many citizens and others, among whom is the mayor, are now in confinement. The matter has been traced up to governor Tryon; and the mayor appears to have been a principal agent, or go-between him and the perſons concerned in it. The plot has been communicated to ſome of the army, and part of my guard engaged in it. T * * * H * * *, one of them, has been tried, and, by the unanimous opinion of a court-martial, is ſentenced to die,—having enliſted himſelf, and engaged others. The ſentence, by the advice of the whole council of general officers, will be put in execution to-day at eleven o'clock. The others are not tried, I am hopeful this example will produce ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſalutary conſequences, and deter others from entering into the like traitorous practices.</p>
                  <p>The encloſed copy of a reſolve of the provincial Congreſs will ſhew that ſome of the diaffected on Long-Iſland have taken up arms.—I have, agreeable to their requeſt, ſent a party after them, but have not as yet been able to apprehend
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:031423_0143_0FEC59E84F6DE7C8"/>
them,—having concealed themſelves in different woods and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſes.</p>

                  <p>I this moment received a letter from lieutenant Daviſon, of the Schuyler armed ſloop, a copy of which I have incloſed; to which I beg leave to refer you for the intelligence communicated by him.</p>
                  <p>I could wiſh general Howe and his armament not to arrive yet, as not more than a thouſand militia have yet come in, and our whole force, (including the troops at all the detached poſts, and on board the armed veſſels, which are comprehended in our returns) is but ſmall and inconſiderable, when compared with the exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive lines they are to defend, and (moſt probably) the army that he brings. I have no further intelligence about him than what the lieutenant mentions: but it is extremely probable his accounts and conjectures are true.</p>

                  <p>I WAS laſt night honored with your favor of the twenty-ſixth inſtant, and, agreeable to your requeſt, ſhall pay proper atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the reſolves it incloſed.</p>
                  <p>I obſerve the augmentation Congreſs have reſolved to make to the forces deſtined to the northern department, and the bounty be allowed ſuch ſoldiers as will enliſt for three years. I hope many good conſequences will reſult from theſe meaſures; and that, from the latter, a conſiderable number of men may be induced to engage in the ſervice.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould eſteem myſelf extremely happy to afford the leaſt aſſiſtance to the Canada department in compliance with the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire of Congreſs and your requiſition, were it in my power: but it is not. The return which I tranſmitted yeſterday will but too well convince Congreſs of my incapacity in this inſtance, and point out to them that the force I now have is trifling, conſidering the many and important poſts that are neceſſary, and muſt be ſupported, if poſſible. But few militia have yet
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:031423_0144_0FEC59EEB3D2C110"/>
come in, the whole being about twelve hundred, including the two battalions of this city, and one company from the Jerſeys. I wiſh the delay may not be attended with diſagreeable conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and their aid may not come too late, or when it may not be wanted. I have wrote,—I have done every thing I could, to call them in: but they have not come, though I am told that they are generally willing.</p>
                  <p>The accounts communicated yeſterday through lieutenant Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſon's letter are partly confirmed, and, I dare ſay, will turn out to be true on the whole. For two or three days paſt, three or four ſhips have been dropping in; and I juſt now received an expreſs from an officer appointed to keep a look-out on Staten-Iſland, that forty-five arrived at the Hook to-day:—ſome ſay more;—and I ſuppoſe the whole fleet will be in, within a day or two. I am hopeful, before they are prepared to attack, that I ſhall get ſome reinforcements.—Be this as it may, I ſhall at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to make the beſt diſpoſition I can of the troops, in order to give them a proper reception, and to prevent the ruin and deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are meditating againſt us.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as the expreſs arrived laſt night, I ſent the letters for the northern colonies, to the quarter-maſter-general, with orders to forward them immediately.</p>
                  <p>When monſieur Wiebert comes—(I have not ſeen him yet)—I ſhall employ him as Congreſs have directed. The terms upon which he offers his ſervice ſeem to promiſe ſomething from him. I wiſh he may anſwer, and be ſkilled in the buſineſs he ſays he is acquainted with.</p>

                  <p>I HAD the pleaſure of receiving your favor of the twenty-ninth, early this morning, with which you have been pleaſed to honor me, together with the reſolves for a further augmentation of the army.</p>
                  <p>The battalions of Germans, which Congreſs have ordered to be raiſed, will be a corps of much ſervice: and I am hopeful that ſuch perſons will be appointed officers, as will complete their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtments with all poſſible expedition.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall communicate to colonel Sterenſon and one of his field-officers what you have requeſted, and direct them to repair immediately to Philadelphia. It is an unlucky circumſtance that the term of enliſtment of theſe three companies, and of the
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:031423_0145_0FEC479270E14288"/>
rifle battalion, ſhould expire at this time, when a hot campaign is, in all probability, about to commence.</p>
                  <p>Canada, it is certain, would have been an important acquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and well worth the expenſes incurred in the purſuit of it. But as we could not reduce it to our poſſeſſion, the retreat of our army with ſo little loſs, under ſuch a variety of diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, muſt be eſteemed a moſt fortunate event. It is true, the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts we have received, do not fully authoriſe us to ſay that we have ſuſtained no loſs: but they hold forth a probable ground for ſuch concluſion.—I am anxious to hear it confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>I have the honor of tranſmitting you an extract of a letter received laſt night from general Ward.—If the ſcheme the privateers had in view, and the meaſures he had planned, have been carried into execution, the Highland corps will be tolerably well diſpoſed of: but I fear the fortunate event has not taken place.</p>
                  <p>In general Ward's letter, was incloſed one from lieutenant-col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onel Campbell, who was made priſoner with the Highland troops. I have tranſmitted you a copy. This will give you a full and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act account of the number of priſoners that were on Board the four tranſports; and will prove, beyond a poſſibility of doubt, that the evacuation of Boſton by the Britiſh troops was a matter neither known nor expected when he received his orders. Indeed ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny facts had concurred before to ſettle the matter, that no additi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal proofs were neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>When I had the honor of addreſſing you yeſterday, I had only been informed of the arrival of forty-five of the fleet in the morning. Since that, I have received authentic intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from ſundry perſons (among them, from general Greene) that a hundred and ten ſail came in before night, that were count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and that more were ſeen about duſk in the offing—I have no doubt but the whole that ſailed from Halifax are now at the Hook.</p>
                  <p>Juſt as I was about to conclude my letter, I received one from a gentleman upon the ſubject of calling the five regiments from Boſton to the defence of Canada or New-York, and to have militia raiſed in their lieu.—I have ſent you a copy, and ſhall only obſerve, that I know the author well; his hand-writing is quite familiar to me: he is a member of the general court, very ſenſible, of great influence, and a warm and zealous friend to the cauſe of America.—The expedient propoſed by him is ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Congreſs.</p>

                  <p>SINCE I had the honor of addreſſing you, and on the ſame day, ſeveral ſhips more arrived within the Hook, making the number that came in then a hundred and ten; and there remains no doubt of the whole of the fleet from Halifax being now here. Yeſterday evening fifty of them came up the bay, and anchored on the Staten-Iſland ſide. Their views I cannot preciſely determine; but am extremely apprehenſive, as part of them only came, that they mean to ſurround the iſland, and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the ſtock upon it. I had conſulted with a committee of the provincial Congreſs upon the ſubject, before the arrival of the fleet; and they appointed a perſon to ſuperintend the buſiueſs, and to drive the ſtock off. I alſo wrote to brigadier-general Heard, and directed him to the meaſure, leſt it might be neglected; but am fearful it has not been effected.</p>
                  <p>Our reinforcement of militia is yet but ſmall:—I cannot aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain the amount, not having got a return. However, I truſt, if the enemy make an attack, they will meet with a repulſe, as I have the pleaſure to inform you that an agreeable ſpirit and willingneſs for action ſeem to animate and pervade the whole of our troops.</p>
                  <p>As it is difficult to determine what objects the enemy may have in contemplation, and whether they may not detach ſome part of their force to Amboy, and to ravage that part of the country, if not extend their views farther, I ſubmit it to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs whether it may not be expedient for them to repeat and preſs home their requeſts to the different governments that are to provide men for the flying camp, to furniſh their quotas with all poſſible diſpatch. It is a matter of great importance, and will be of ſerious conſequence, to have the camp eſtabliſhed in caſe the enemy ſhould be able to poſſeſs themſelves of this river, and cut off the ſupplies of troops that might be neceſſary on certain emer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gencies to be ſent from hence.</p>
                  <p>I muſt entreat your attention to an application I made ſome time ago, for flints. We are extremely deficient in this neceſſary arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and ſhall be greatly diſtreſſed if we cannot obtain a ſupply. Of lead we have a ſufficient quantity for the whole campaign, taken off the houſes here.</p>
                  <p>Eſtimating it of infinite advantage to prevent the enemy from getting freſh proviſions, and horſes for their waggons, ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery, &amp;c. I gave orders to a party of our men on Staten-Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land (ſince writing to general Heard) to drive the ſtock off, without waiting for the aſſiſtance or direction of the commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:031423_0147_0FEC59F745822BE8"/>
there, leſt their ſlow mode of tranſacting buſineſs might produce too much delay;—and have ſent this morning to know what they have done.—I am this morning informed by a gentleman, that the committee of Elizabeth-town ſent their company of light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe on monday to effect it, and that ſome of their militia were to give their aid yeſterday. He adds that he was credibly told laſt night by a party of the militia coming to this place, that yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday they ſaw a good deal of ſtock driving off the iſland, and croſſing to the Jerſeys.—If the buſineſs is not executed before now, it will be impoſſible to do it.</p>

I am not acquainted with them my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but from their report and recommendation, which I doubt not to be juſt; and that, if Congreſs will pleaſe to inquire of them, they will mention other proper perſons for officers.</p>

                  <p>WHEN I had the honor to addreſs you on the thirtieth ultimo, I tranſmited a copy of a letter I had received from a gentleman, a member of the honorable general court [<hi>of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts</hi>] ſuggeſting the improbability of ſuccours coming from thence in any reaſonable time, either for the defence of this place, or to reinforce our troops engaged in the Canada expedition. I am ſorry to inform you, that from a variety of intelligence, his apprehenſions appear to be juſt, and to be fully confirmed: nor have I reaſon to expect but that the ſupplies from the other two governments, Connecticut and New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:031423_0148_0FEC59F9A95D91B0"/>
will be extremely ſlow and greatly deficient in num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber.</p>
                  <p>As it now ſeems beyond queſtion, and clear to demonſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the enemy mean to direct their operations and bend their moſt vigorous efforts againſt this colony, and will attempt to unite their two armies, that under general Burgoyne, and the one arrived here,—I cannot but think the expedient pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed by that gentleman is excedingly juſt; and that the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental regiments, now in the Maſſachuſetts-Bay, ſhould be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately called from thence, and be employed where there is the ſtrongeſt reaſon to believe their aid will be indiſpenſably neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. The expediency of the meaſure I ſhall ſubmit to the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratation of Congreſs, and will only obſerve, as my opinion, that there is not the moſt diſtant proſpect of an attempt being made, where they now are, by the enemy; and, if there ſhould, that the militia that can be aſſembled upon the ſhorteſt notice will be more than equal to repel it. They are well armed, reſolute, and determined, and will inſtantly oppoſe any invaſion that may be made in their own colony.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall alſo take the liberty again to requeſt Congreſs to intereſt themſelves in having the militia raiſed, and forwarded with all poſſible expedition, as faſt as any conſiderable number of them can be collected, that are to compoſe the flying camp. This I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned in my letter yeſterday but think proper to repeat it, being more and more convinced of the neceſſity. The camp will be in the neighborhood of Amboy: and I ſhall be glad that the conventions, or committees of ſafety, of thoſe governments from whence they come, may be requeſted to give me previous notice of their march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that I may form ſome plan, and direct proviſion to be made for their reception.</p>
                  <p>The diſaffection of the people at that place and others not far diſtant, is exceedingly great; and, unleſs it is checked and overawed, it muſt become more general, and be very alarming. The arrival of the enemy will encourage it. They, or at leaſt a part of them, are already landed on Staten-Iſland which is quite contiguous; and about four thouſand were marching a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout it yeſterday, as I have been adviſed, and are leaving no arts un-eſſayed to gain the inhabitants to their ſide, who ſeem but too favorably diſpoſed. It is not unlikely that in a little time they may attempt to croſs to the Jerſey ſide, and induce many to join them either from motives of intereſt or fear, unleſs there is a force to oppoſe them.</p>
                  <p>As we are fully convinced that the miniſterial army we ſhall have to oppoſe this campaign, will be great and numerous, and
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:031423_0149_0FEC59FB4CDB7548"/>
well know that the utmoſt induſtry will be uſed, as it already has been to excite the ſavages and every body of people to arms againſt us whom they can influence, it certainly behoves us to ſtrain every nerve to counteract their deſigns. I would therefore ſubmit it to Congreſs whether, (eſpecially as our ſchemes for employing the weſtern Indians do not ſeem to be attended with any great proſpect of ſucceſs, from general Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler's accounts) it may not be adviſeable to take meaſures to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage thoſe of the eaſtward, the St. Johns, Nova-Scotia, Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nobſcot, &amp;c. in our favor. I have been told that ſeveral might be got, perhaps five or ſix hundred or more, readily to join us. If they can, I ſhould imagine it ought to be done. It will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our enemies from ſecuring their friendſhip; and further they will be of infinite ſervice in annoying and harraſſing them, ſhould they ever attempt to penetrate the country. Congreſs will be pleaſed to conſider the meaſure: and if they determine to adopt it, I conceive it will be neceſſary to authoriſe and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt the general court of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay to carry it into execution. Their ſituation and advantages will enable them to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotiate a treaty and an alliance better than it can be done by any perſon elſe.</p>
                  <p>I have been honored with your two favors of the firſt inſtant; and, agreeable to the wiſhes of Congreſs, ſhall put monſieur Wiebert in the beſt place I can to prove his abilities in the art he profeſſes. I ſhall ſend him up immediately to the works erecting towards Kingſbridge, under the direction of general Mifflin, whom I ſhall requeſt to employ him.</p>
                  <p>I this moment received a letter from general Greene, an extract of which I have incloſed. The intelligence it contains is of the moſt important nature, and evinces the neceſſity of the moſt ſpirited and vigorous exertions on our part.</p>
                  <p>The expectation of the fleet under admiral Howe is certainly the reaſon the army already come have not begun their hoſtile operations. When that arrives, we may look for the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſting events, and ſuch as, in all probability, will have conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable weight in the preſent conteſt. It behoves us to be prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the beſt manner: and I ſubmit it again to Congreſs, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the accounts given by their priſoners do not ſhew the proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of calling the ſeveral continental regiments from the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts government, raiſing the flying camp with all poſſible diſpatch, and engaging the eaſtern Indians.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>July 5.</hi>—General Mercer arrived here on tueſday, and the next morning was ordered to Paulus-Hook, to make ſome arrangements of the militia as they come in, and the beſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition

he could to prevent the enemy croſſing from Staten-Iſland, if they ſhould have any ſuch views. The diſtreſſed ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the inhabitants of Elizabeth. Town and Newark has ſince induced me, upon their application, to give up all the militia from the Jerſeys, except thoſe engaged for ſix months. I am hopeful they will be able to repel any incurſions that may be attempted. Generals Mercer and Livingſton are concerting plans for that purpoſe. By a letter from the latter laſt night, I am informed the enemy are throwing up ſmall works at all the paſſes on the north ſide of Staten Iſland, which it is probable they mean to ſecure.</p>
                  <p>None of the Connecticut militia are yet arrived: ſo that the reinforcement we have received is very inconſiderable.</p>
                  <p>A letter from general Schuyler, with ſundry incloſures (of which No. 1, 2, and 3, are exact copies), this moment came to hand, and will no doubt claim, as it ought to do, the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate attention of Congreſs. The evils which muſt inevitably follow a diſputed command are too obvious and alarming to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit a moment's delay in your deciſion thereupon: and, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I do not preſume to adviſe in a matter, now, of this delicacy, yet as it appears evident that the northern army has retreated to Crown-Point, and mean to act upon the defenſive only, I cannot help giving it as my opinion that one of the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor-generals in that quarter would be more uſefully employed here, or in the flying camp, than there: for it becomes my duty to obſerve, if another experienced officer is taken from hence in order to command the flying camp, that your grand army will be entirely ſtripped of generals who have ſeen ſervice,—being in a manner already deſtitute of ſuch. My diſtreſs on this account,—the appointment of general Whitcomb to the eaſtern regiments,—a conviction in my own breaſt that no troops will be ſent to Boſton,—and the certainty of a number coming to this place,—occaſioned by poſtponing, from time to time, ſend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any general officer from hence to the eaſtward heretofore: and now I ſhall wait the ſentiments of Congreſs relative to the five regiments in Maſſachuſetts-Bay, before I do any thing in this matter.</p>
                  <p>The commiſſary-general has been with me this morning, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the other matter contained in general Schuyler's letter reſpecting the buſineſs of that department. He has, I believe, (in order to remove difficulties), recalled Mr. Avery, but ſeems to think it neceſſary in that caſe, that Mr. Livingſton ſhould be left to himſelf, as he cannot be reſponſible for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons not of his own appointment.—This matter ſhould alſo be
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:031423_0151_0FEC5A06D5A8AD80"/>
clearly defined by Congreſs.—I have already giving my opinion of the neceſſity of theſe matters being under one general direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in ſo full and clear a manner, that I ſhall not take up the time of Congreſs to repeat it in this place.</p>

                  <p>CONGRESS having reſolved to raiſe a regiment of Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans to counteract the deſigns of our enemies, I muſt beg leave to recommend to their notice John David Wilpert, now a firſt lieutenant in colonel Shee's battallion, to the office of captain in ſaid regiment. I am perſonally acquainted with him, and know that he joined the Virginia forces under my command in the year 1754, and continued in ſervice the whole war, during which he conducted himſelf as an active, vigilant, and brave officer. He is a German; and his merit, as a ſoldier, entitles him much to the office he wiſhes for.</p>

                  <p>I AM now to acknowledge the receipt of your two favors of the fourth and fifth inſtant, which came duly to hand, with their important incloſures.</p>
                  <p>I perceive that Congreſs have been employed in deliberating <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n meaſutes of the moſt intereſting nature. It is certain that it is not with us to determine in many inſtances what conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences will flow from our councils; but yet it behoves us to adopt ſuch, as, under the ſmiles of a gracious and all-kind pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, will be moſt likely to promote our happineſs. I truſt the late deciſive part they have taken is calculated for that end, and will ſecure us that freedom and thoſe priviledges, which have been and are refuſed us, contrary to the voice of nature and the Britiſh conſtitution. Agreeable to the requeſt of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, I cauſed "THE DECLARATION" to be proclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed before all the army under my immediate command; and have the pleaſure to inform them that the meaſure ſeemed to have their moſt hearty aſſent,—the expreſſions and behavior, both of officers and men, teſtifying their warmeſt approbation of it. I have tranſmitted a copy to general Ward at Boſton,
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:031423_0152_0FEC5A09D7495D60"/>
requeſting him to have it proclaimed to the continental troops in that department.</p>
                  <p>It is with great pleaſure that I hear the militia from Maryland, the Delaware government, and Pennſylvania, will be in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion every day to form the flying camp. It is of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, and ſhould be accompliſhed with all poſſible diſpatch. The readineſs and alacrity, with which the committee of ſafety of Pennſylvania and the other conferees have acted in order to forward the aſſociated militia of that ſtate to the Jerſeys for ſervice, till the men to compoſe the flying camp arrive, ſtrongly evidence their regard to the common cauſe, and that nothing on their part will be wanting to ſupport it. I hope, and I doubt not, that the aſſociated militia, impreſſed with the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pediency of the meaſure, will immediately carry it into execution, and furniſh in this inſtance a proof of the continuance of that zeal which has ſo eminently marked their conduct. I have directed the commiſſary to make the neceſſary proviſion for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, who will alſo ſupply the army for the flying camp with rations.—A proper officer will be appointed to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand it.</p>
                  <p>In purſuance of the power given me by Congreſs, and the advice of my general officers, I have wrote to general Ward, and deſired him forthwith to detach three of the fulleſt regiments from the Maſſachuſetts-Bay to join the northern army,—eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teeming it a<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> matter of the greateſt importance to have a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient force there to prevent the enemy paſſing the lake and mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an impreſſion in that quarter.—The gondolas and gallies will be of great ſervice; and I am hopeful the carpenters you have ſent from Philadelphia, and that will go from the eaſtward on your ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, will be able to build a ſufficient number in time to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer every exigency.</p>
                  <p>I have requeſted governor Cooke, if the duck mentioned in Mr. Greene's letter is proper for tents, to have it made up as early as poſſible and forwarded here. I have alſo deſired him to ſend the flints and ſmall-arms, as I gave general Ward thoſe of the latter that were taken out of the Scotch tranſports,—our deficiency in theſe neceſſary articles being ſtill great.</p>
                  <p>Obſerving that Congreſs have particularly mentioned a bounty of ten dollars to be paid to men of ſome corps directed to be raiſed in two or three inſtances ſince their reſolve of the twenty-ſixth of June allowing ſuch bounty, I have been led to doubt how that reſolve is to be conſtrued; whether it is a general re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulation, and extends to all men that will engage for three years,—for inſtance, the ſoldiers of the preſent army, if they
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:031423_0153_0FEC5A0B8E34B030"/>
will enliſt for that time. If it is, and extends to them, it will be neceſſary to forward a large ſum of money:—many perhaps would engage.</p>
                  <p>I alſo obſerve, by their reſolve of the twenty-fifth of June for raiſing four regiments of militia in the eaſtern governments to augment the troops in the northern department, that the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblies of thoſe governments are empowered to appoint pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters to the ſaid regiments. This appears, to me a regulation of great uſe, and I could wiſh that it was made general, and one allowed to every regiment in the ſervice. Many advantages would reſult from it.</p>
                  <p>The Connecticut militia begin to come in: but from every account the battalions will be very incomplete,—owing, they ſay, to the buſy ſeaſon of the year. That government, leſt any inconvenience might reſult from their militia not being here in time, ordered three regiments of their light-horſe to my aſſiſtance, part of which have arrived. But, not having the means to ſupport them (and, if it could be done, the expenſe would be enormous), I have thanked the gentlemen for their zeal, and the attachment they have manifeſted upon this occaſion, and informed them that I cannot conſent to their keeping their horſes,—at the ſame time wiſhing them to ſtay them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.—I am told they or part of them mean to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>General Mercer is now in the Jerſeys, for the purpoſe of receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ordering the militia coming for the flying camp: and I have ſent over our chief engineer to view the ground within the neighborhood of Amboy, and to lay out ſome ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary works for the encampment, and ſuch as may be proper at the different paſſes in Bergen-neck, and other places on the Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey ſhore oppoſite Staten Iſland, to prevent the making impreſſions, and committing depredations on the property of the inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants.</p>
                  <p>The intelligence that we have from a few deſerters that have come over to us, and from others, is that general Howe has between nine and ten thouſand men, who are chiefly landed on the iſland, poſted in different parts, and ſecuring the ſeveral com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munications from the Jerſeys with ſmall works and intrench<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to prevent our people from paying them a viſit;—that the iſlanders have all joined them, ſeem well diſpoſed to favor their cauſe, and have agreed to take up arms in their behalf. They look for admiral Howe's arrival every day with his fleet and a large reinforcement; are in high ſpirits, and talk confident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of ſucceſs, and carrying all before them when he comes. I truſt, through divine favor and our own exertions, they will
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:031423_0154_0FEC5A0D34CC1D00"/>
be diſappointed in their views; and at all events, any advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages they may gain will coſt them very dear. If our troops will behave well (which I hope will be the caſe, having every thing to contend for, that freemen hold dear), they will have to wade through much blood and ſlaughter before they can car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry any part of our works, if they carry them at all,—and, at beſt, be in poſſeſſion of a melancholy and mournful victory.—May the ſacredneſs of our cauſe inſpire our ſoldiery with ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of heroiſm, and lead them to the preformances of the nobleſt exploits!</p>

                  <p>I WAS honored with your favor of the eighth inſtant by yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday morning's poſt, with the ſeveral reſolves to which you refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red my attention. I ſhall duly regard them, and attempt their exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution as far as I am able.</p>
                  <p>By virtue of the diſcretionary power that Congreſs were pleaſed to veſt me with, and by advice of ſuch of my general officers as I have had an opportunity of conſulting, I have ordered the two remaining continental regiments in the Maſſachuſetts-Bay to march immediately for the defence of this place, in full confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence that nothing hoſtile will be attempted againſt that ſtate in the preſent campaign.</p>
                  <p>I have wrote to the general court of Maſſachuſetts-Bay, and tranſmitted a copy of the reſolve for employing the eaſtern Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, entreating their good offices in this inſtance, and their exerti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to have them forthwith engaged and marched to join this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. I have deſired five or ſix hundred of them to be enliſted for two or three years, if they will conſent to it,—ſubject to an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lier diſcharge, if it ſhall be thought neceſſary,—and upon the ſame terms as the continental troops, if better cannot be had,—though I am hopeful they may.</p>
                  <p>In my letter of yeſterday I mentioned the arrival of part of the Connecticut light-horſe to aſſiſt in the defence of this place, and my objection to their horſes being kept. Four or five hundred of them are now come in: and, in juſtice to their zeal and laudable attachment to the cauſe of their country, I am to inform you that they have conſented to ſtay as long as occaſion may require, though they ſhould be at the expence of maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their horſes themſelves. They have paſtured them out a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the neighborhood of Kingſbridge (being unwilling to ſend
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:031423_0155_0FEC5A0EEAFE0310"/>
them away) at the rate of half a dollar per week each, mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to leave it entirely with Congreſs either to allow or refuſe it, as they ſhall judge proper. I promiſed to make this repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentation, and thought it my duty: and will only obſerve that the motives which induced them firſt to ſet out were good and praiſe-worthy, and were to afford the moſt ſpeedy and early ſuccour, which they apprehended would be wanted before the militia arrived. Their ſervices may be extremely important,—being moſt of them, if not all, men of reputation and of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty.</p>
                  <p>The ſubject of the incloſed copy of a letter from governor Trumbull I beg leave to ſubmit to the conſideration of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. They will perceive from his repreſentation, the diſquieting apprehenſions that have ſeized on the minds of the people ſince the retreat of the northern army, and how expoſed the northern frontiers of New-York and New-Hampſhire are to the ravages and incurſions of the Indians. How far it may be expedient to raiſe the battallion he conceives neceſſary to prevent the calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and diſtreſſes he points out, they will determine, upon what he has ſaid, and the neceſſity that may appear to them for the meaſure;—what I have done, being only to lay the matter before them in compliance with his wiſhes.</p>
                  <p>I have alſo incloſed a memorial from the ſurgeons'-mate, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting forth the inadequacy of their pay to their ſervices and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, and praying that it may be increaſed. I ſhall obſerve that they have a long time complained in this inſtance, and that ſome additional allowance may not be unneceſſary.</p>
                  <p>As I am truly ſenſible the time of Congreſs is much taken up with a variety of important matters, it is with unwillingneſs and pain I ever repeat a requeſt after having once made it, or take the liberty of enforcing any opinion of mine after it is once given; but as the eſtabliſhing of ſome office for auditing accounts is a matter of exceeding importance to the public in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt I would beg leave once more to call the attention of Congreſs to an appointment competent to the purpoſe. Two motives induce me to urge the matter; firſt, a conviction of the utility of the meaſure;—ſecondly, that I may ſtand excul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated if hereafter it ſhould appear that money has been impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly expended, and neceſſaries for the army obtained upon unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable terms.</p>
                  <p>For me, whoſe time is employed from the hour of my riſing till I retire to bed again, to go into an examination of the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of ſuch an army as this with any degree of preciſion and exactneſs, without neglecting other matters of equal impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:031423_0156_0FEC5A12DC514868"/>
is utterly impracticable. All that I have been able to do (and that, in fact, was doing nothing), was, when the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſary, and quarter-maſter, and director-general of the hoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal (for it is to theſe the great advances are made) applied for warrants,—to make them at times produce a general account of their expenditures. But this anſwers no valuable purpoſe. It is the minutiae that muſt be gone into,—the propriety of each charge examined,—the vouchers looked into;—and, with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to the commiſſary-general, his victualling returns and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penditures of proviſions ſhould be compared with his purchaſes: otherwiſe a perſon in this department, if he was inclined to be knaviſh, might purchaſe large quantities with the public money, and ſell one half of it again for private emolument; and yet his accounts upon paper would appear fair, and be ſupported with vouchers for every charge.</p>
                  <p>I do not urge this matter from a ſuſpicion of any unfair prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices in either of the departments before mentioned; and ſorry ſhould I be if this conſtruction was put upon it,—having a high opinion of the honor and integrity of theſe gentlemen. But there ſhould, nevertheleſs, be ſome control as well upon their diſcretion as honeſty:—to which may be added, that accounts become perplexed and confuſed by long ſtanding, and the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors therein not ſo diſcoverable as if they underwent an early reviſion and examination. I am well appriſed that a treaſury-office of accounts has been reſolved upon, and an auditor-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral for ſettling all public accounts; but, with all deference and ſubmiſſion to the opinion of Congreſs, theſe inſtitutions are not calculated to prevent the inconveniencies I have mentioned; nor can they be competent to the purpoſes, circumſtanced as they are.</p>
                  <p>We have intelligence from a deſerter that came to us, that, on wedneſday morning, the Aſia, Chatham, and Greyhound men-of-war weighed anchor, and (it was ſaid) intended to paſs up the North-river above the city, to prevent the communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the Jerſeys. They did not attempt it, nor does he know what prevented them.—A priſoner belonging to the tenth regiment, taken yeſterday, informs that they hourly expected admiral Howe and his fleet. He adds that a veſſel has arrived from them, and the prevailing opinion is, that an attack will be made immediately on their arrival.</p>
                  <p>By a letter from general Ward, I am informed that the ſmall-pox has broke out at Boſton, and infected ſome of the troops. I have wrote to him to place the invalids under an officer, to remain till they are well; and to uſe every poſſible
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:031423_0157_0FEC5A150D63BFE8"/>
precaution to prevent the troops from thence bringing the infection. The diſtreſſes and calamities we have already ſuffered by this diſorder in one part of our army, I hope, will excite his utmoſt care that they may not be increaſed.</p>

                  <p>THE deſign of this is to inform Congreſs, that, about half after three o'clock this evening, two of the enemy's ſhips of war, one of forty and the other of twenty guns, with three tenders, weighed anchor in the bay oppoſite Staten-Iſland, and, availing themſelves of a briſk and favorable breeze, with a flowing tide, ran paſt our batteries up the North-river, without receiving any certain damage that I could perceive, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding a heavy and inceſſant cannonade was kept up from our ſeveral batteries here, as well as from that at Paulus-Hook. They, on their part, returned and continued the fire as they ran by.—I diſpatched an expreſs to brigadier-general Mifflin at our encampment towards the upper end of the Iſland; but have not heard whether they have got by, or received any da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mage.</p>
                  <p>The account tranſmitted by this morning's poſt, reſpecting the arrival of one of the fleet, ſeems to be confirmed. Several ſhips have come in to-day: among them, one this evening with a Saint-George's flag at her fore-top-maſt-head, which we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude to be admiral Howe from the circumſtances of the flag, and the ſeveral and general ſalutes that were paid. It is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable they will all arrive in a day or two, and immediately begin their operations.</p>
                  <p>As it will be extremely neceſſary that the flying camp ſhould be well provided with powder and ball, and it may be imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable to ſend ſupplies from hence on account of our hurry and engagements (beſides, the communication may be uncertain), I muſt beg the attention of Congreſs to this matter, and requeſt that they will forward with all poſſible expedition ſuch a quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of muſket-powder and lead (if balls of different ſizes can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be had), as will be ſufficient for the militia to compoſe that camp.</p>
                  <p>By an expreſs this minute arrived from general Mifflin, the ſhips have paſſed his works.</p>

                  <p>MY laſt of friday evening, which I had the honor of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſing you, adviſed that two of the enemy's ſhips of war and three tenders had run above our batteries here and the works at the upper end of the Iſland. I am now to inform you, that, yeſterday afternoon, receiving intelligence from general Mifflin that they had paſſed the Tappan-ſea, and were trying to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed higher up,—by advice of R. R. Livingſton, eſquire, and other gentlemen, I diſpatched expreſſes to general Clinton of Ulſter, and the committee of ſafety for Dutcheſs-county, to take meaſures for ſecuring the paſſes in the Highlands, leſt they might have deſigns of ſeizing them, and have a force con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cealed for the purpoſe. I wrote the evening before to the commanding officer of the two garriſons there to be vigilant and prepared againſt any attempts they or any diſaffected perſons might make againſt them, and to forward expreſſes all the way to Albany, that proviſion and other veſſels might be ſecured and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented falling into their hands.</p>
                  <p>The information given general Mifflin was rather premature, as to their having gone paſt the Sea.—A letter from the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of Orange-county, which come to hand this morning, ſays they were there yeſterday, and that a regiment of their militia was under arms, to prevent their landing, and making an incur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. The meſſenger who brought it, and to whom it refers for particulars, adds that a party of them, in two or three boats, had approached the ſhore, but were forced back by our people firing at them. Since the manoeuvre of friday, there have been no other movements in the fleet.</p>
                  <p>General Sullivan, in a letter of the ſecond inſtant, informs me of his arrival with the army at Crown-Point, where he is fortifying and throwing up works. He adds, that he has ſecur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the ſtores except three cannon left at Chamblee which in part is made up by taking a fine twelve-pounder out of the lake.—The army is ſickly,—many with the ſmall-pox; and he is apprehenſive, the militia ordered to join them, will not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape the infection.—An officer he had ſent to reconnoitre had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported that he ſaw at Saint John's about a hundred and fifty tents,—twenty at Saint Roy's, and fifteen at Chamblee; and works at the firſt were buſily carrying on.</p>
                  <p>I have incloſed a general return of the army here, which will ſhew the whole of our ſtrength. All the detached poſts are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="160" facs="unknown:031423_0159_0FEC5A1D72882458"/>
A letter from the eaſtward, by laſt night's poſt to Mr. Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, poſt-maſter in this city, adviſes that two ſhips had been taken and carried into Cape-Ann,—one from Autigua, conſigned to general Howe, with four hundred and thirty-nine punche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of rum,—the other a Jamaica-man, with four hundred hogſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heads of ſugar, two hundred puncheons of rum, thirty-nine bales of cotton, pimento, fuſtic, &amp;c. &amp;c. Each mounted two guns, ſix pounders.</p>
                  <p>About three o'clock this afternoon I was informed that a flag from lord Howe was coming up, and waited with two of our whale-boats, until directions ſhould be given, I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately convened ſuch of the general officers as were not upon other duty, who agreed in opinion that I ought not to receive any letters directed to me as a private gentleman: but if other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, and the officer deſired to come up to deliver the letter him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, as was ſuggeſted, he ſhould come under a ſafe conduct. Upon this, I directed colonel Reed to go down and manage the affair under the above general inſtruction.</p>
                  <p>On his return, he informed me, that after the common civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities, the officer acquainted him that he had a letter from lord Howe to Mr. Waſhington, which he ſhewed under a ſubſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, "<hi>To George Waſhington, eſquire.</hi>"—Colonel Reed repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, there was no ſuch perſon in the army, and that a letter in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the general, could not be received under ſuch a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection.—The officer expreſſed great concern,—ſaid it was a letter rather of a civil than military nature,—that lord Howe regretted he had not arrived ſooner,—that he (lord Howe) had great powers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—The anxiety to have the letter received was very evident, though the officer diſclaimed all knowledge of its contents. However, colonel Reed's inſtructions being poſitive, they parted.—After they had got ſome diſtance, the officer with the flag again put about and aſked under what di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection Mr. Waſhington choſe to be addreſſed: to which colonel Reed anſwered, his ſtation was well known, and that certainly they could be at no loſs how to direct to him.—The officer ſaid they knew it and lamented it; and again repeated his wiſh that the letter could be received.—Colonel Reed told him a proper direction would obviate all difficulties, and that this was no new matter,—this ſubject having been fully diſcuſſed in the courſe of laſt year; of which lord Howe could not be ignorant:—upon which they parted.</p>
                  <p>I would not upon any occaſion ſacrifice eſſentials to punc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilio: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> in this inſtance, the opinion of others concurring with my own, I deemed it a duty to my country and my ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment,
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:031423_0160_0FEC5A20E453FCE0"/>
to inſiſt upon that reſpect, which, in any other than a public view, I would willingly have waved. Nor do I doubt, but from the ſuppoſed nature of the meſſage, and the anxiety ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, they will either repeat their flag, or fall upon ſome mode to communicate the import and [<hi>contents</hi>] of it.</p>
                  <p>I have been duly honored with your two letters,—that of the tenth by Mr. Anderſon,—and the eleventh with its incloſures. I have directed the quarter-maſter to provide him with every thing he wants to carry his ſcheme into execution. It is an important one, and I wiſh it ſucceſs; but am doubtful that it will be better in theory than practice.</p>
                  <p>The paſſage of the ſhips of war and tenders up the river is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of great importance, and has excited much conjecture and ſpeculation. To me two things have occurred as leading them to this proceeding,—firſt a deſign to ſeize on the narrow paſſes on both ſides of the river, giving almoſt the only land com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with Albany, and of conſequence, with our north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern army; for which purpoſe, they might have troops concealed on board, which they deemed competent of themſelves, as the defiles are narrow,—or; that they would be joined by many diſaffected perſons in that quarter. Others have added a probability of their having a large quantity of arms on board, to be in readineſs to put into the hands of the to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries immediately on the arrival of the fleet, or rather at the time they intend to make their attack.—The ſecond is, to cut off entirely all intercourſe between this and Albany, by water, and the upper country, and to prevent ſupplies of every kind going and coming.</p>
                  <p>Theſe matters are truly alarming, and of ſuch importance, that I have wrote to the provincial congreſs of New-York, and recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to their ſerious conſideration the adoption of every poſſible expedient to guard againſt the two firſt; and have ſuggeſted the propriety of their employing the militia, or ſome part of them, in the counties in which theſe defiles are, to keep the enemy from poſſeſſing them, till further proviſion can be made; and to write to the ſeveral leading perſons on our ſide in that quarter, to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to all the movements of the ſhips and the diſaffected, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to diſcover and fruſtrate whatever pernicious ſchemes they have in view.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect to the ſecond conjecture of my own, and which ſeems to be generally adopted, I have the pleaſure to inform Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, that, if their deſign is to keep the armies from provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, the commiſſary has told me upon inquiry, he has for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded ſupplies to Albany ſnow there, and above it) ſufficient
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:031423_0161_0FEC5A2277846700"/>
for ten thouſand men for four months;—that he has a ſufficiency here for twenty thouſand men for three months, and an abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant quantity ſecured in different parts of the Jerſeys for the flying camp, beſides having about four thouſand barrels of flour in ſome neighbouring part of Connecticut. Upon this head, there is but little occaſion for any apprehenſions, at leaſt for a conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time.</p>

                  <p>I was this morning honored with yours of the thirteenth inſtant, with its important and neceſſary incloſures; and, in obedience to the commands of Congreſs, have tranſmitted general Howe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves intended for him.

                  <p>The inhuman treatment of the whole, and murder of part of our people, after their ſurrender and capitulation, was certainly a flagrant violation of that ſaith which ought to be held ſacred by all civilized nations, and founded in the moſt ſavage bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barity.

                  <p>I WAS this morning honored with yours of the fifteenth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, with ſundry reſolves.</p>
                  <p>

I perceive the meaſures Congreſs have taken to expedite the raiſing of the flying camp, and providing it with articles of the greateſt uſe. You will ſee by a poſtſcript to my letter of the fourteenth, I had wrote to the commanding officer of the Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania militia, ordering them to be marched from Trenton to Amboy, as their remaining there could not anſwer the leaſt public good. For, having conſulted with ſundry gentlemen, I was informed, if the enemy mean to direct their views to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Pennſylvania, or penetrate the Jerſeys, their route will be from near Amboy, and either by way of Brunſwick or Bound-Brook,—the lower road from South-Amboy being through a woody, ſandy country. Beſides, they will be then able to throw in ſuccour here, and to receive it from hence in caſes of emergency.</p>
                  <p>The Connecticut light-horſe, mentioned in my letter of the eleventh, notwithſtanding their then promiſe to continue here for the defence of this place, are now diſcharged, and about to return home,—having peremptorily refuſed all kind of fatigue, duty, or even to mount guard, claiming an exemption as troop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Though their aſſiſtance is much needed, and might be of eſſential ſervice in caſe of an attack, yet I judged it adviſable, on their application and claim of ſuch indulgences, to diſcharge them; as granting them would ſet an example to others, and might produce many ill conſequences. The number of men included in the laſt return, by this, is leſſened about five hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred.</p>
                  <p>I laſt night received a letter from general Schuyler, with ſeveral incloſures, copies of which I have herewith tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted. They will give Congreſs every information I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting our northern army and the ſituation of our affairs in that quarter;—to which I beg leave to refer their attention.—I cannot but expreſs my ſurpriſe at the ſcarcity of proviſion which general Schuyler mentions, after what the commiſſary aſſured me, and which formed a part of my letter of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth. He ſtill aſſures me of the ſame.—This is a diſtreſſing circumſtance, as every article of proviſion, and every thing neceſſary for that department, can have no other now than a land<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conveyence, the water-communication from hence to Albany being entirely cut off.</p>
                  <p>Congreſs will pleaſe to conſider the incloſure, No. 6, about raiſing ſix companies out of the inhabitants about the lakes, to prevent the incurſions of the Indians. The general officers, in their minutes of council have determined it a matter of much importance;—and their attention to the price of goods fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:031423_0163_0FEC5A27222C2758"/>
the ſoldiery may be extremely neceſſary. They have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained much upon this head.</p>
                  <p>The retreat from Crown-Point ſeems to be conſidered in oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſite views by the general and field-officers. The former (I am ſatisfied) have weighed the matter well; and yet the reaſon aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the latter againſt it appears ſtrong and forcible.—I hope whatever is done will be for the beſt.</p>
                  <p>By a letter from the committee of Orange-Country, received this morning, the men-of-war and tenders were yeſterday at Haverſham-bay, about forty miles above this. A number of men, in four barges from the tenders, attempted to land, with a view (they ſuppoſe) of taking ſome ſheep and cattle, that had been previouſly removed.—A ſmall number of militia that were collected obliged them to retreat, without their doing any damage, with their cannon.—They were ſounding the water up towards the Highlands: by which it is probable they will attempt to paſs with part of the fleet, if poſſible.</p>
                  <p>Yeſterday evening a flag came from general Howe, with a letter addreſſed "<hi>To George Waſhington, eſquire, &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi>"—It was not received, upon the ſame principle that the one from lord Howe was refuſed.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE been duly honored with your favors of the ſixteenth and ſeventeenth, with the ſeveral reſolves they contained; to the execution of which, ſo far as ſhall be in my power, I will pay pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per attention.</p>
                  <p>In my letter of the ſeventeenth I tranſmitted you a copy of one from general Schuyler, and of its ſeveral incloſures.—I confeſs the determination of the council of general officers on the ſeventh, to retreat from Crown-Point, ſurpriſed me much; and the more I conſider it, the more ſtriking does the impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety appear. The reaſon aſſigned againſt it by the field-officers, in their remonſtrance, coincide greatly with my own ideas and thoſe of the other general officers I have had an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pertunity of conſulting with, and ſeem to be of conſiderable weight,—I may add, concluſive.—I am not ſo fully acquainted with the geography of that country and the ſituation of the different poſts, as to pronounce a peremptory judgment upon the matter; but, if my ideas are right, the poſſeſſion of Crown-Point
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:031423_0164_0FEC5A2C9EE871F0"/>
is eſſential, to give us the ſuperiority and maſtery upon the lake.</p>
                  <p>That the enemy will poſſeſs it as ſoon as abandoned by us, there can be no doubt; and if they do, whatever gallies or force we keep on the lake will be unqueſtionably in the rear.—How they are to be ſupported there, or what ſuccour can be drawn from them there, is beyond my comprehenſion.—Perhaps it is only meant that they ſhould be employed on the communication between that and Tyconderoga. If this is the caſe, I fear the views of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs will not be anſwered, nor the ſalutary effects be derived from them, that were intended.</p>
                  <p>I have mentioned my ſurpriſe to general Schuyler, and would, by the advice of the general officers here, have directed that that poſt ſhould be maintained, had it not been for two cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes—an apprehenſion that the works have been deſtoyed, and that, if the army ſhould be ordered from Tyconderoga, or the poſt oppoſite to it (where I preſume they are), to repoſſeſs it, they would have neither one place nor another ſecure and in a defenſible ſtate:—the other, leſt it might increaſe the jealouſy and diverſity of opinions which ſeem already too prevalent in that army, and eſtabliſh a precedent for the inferior officers to ſet up their judgments whenever they would, in oppoſition to thoſe of their ſuperiors,—a matter of great delicacy, and that might lead to fatal conſequences, if countenanced;—though in the preſent inſtance I could wiſh their reaſoning had pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed.</p>
                  <p>If the army has not removed, what I have ſaid to general Schuyler may perhaps bring on a re-conſideration of the matter; and it may not be too late to take meaſures for maintaining that poſt. But of this I have no hope.</p>
                  <p>In conſequence of the reſolve of Congreſs for three of the eaſtern regiments to reinforce the northern army, I wrote to general Ward, and, by advice of my general officers, directed them to march to Norwich, and there to embark for Albany; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving that two valuable purpoſes might reſult therefrom,—firſt, that they would ſooner join the army by purſuing this route, and be ſaved from the diſtreſs and fatigue that muſt attend every long march through the country at this hot and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortable ſeaſon;—and ſecondly, that they might give ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour here, in caſe the enemy ſhould make an attack about the time of their paſſing. But the enemy having now, with their ſhips of war and tenders, cut off the water-communication from hence to Albany, I have wrote this day and directed them to proceed by land acroſs the country.—If Congreſs diſapprove
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:031423_0165_0FEC5A31599944B8"/>
the route, or wiſh to give orders about them, you will pleaſe to certify me thereof, that I may take meaſures accordingly.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed I have the honor to tranſmit you copies of a letter and ſundry reſolutions which I received yeſterday from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention of this ſtate. By them you will perceive they have been acting upon matters of great importance, and are exerting themſelves in the moſt vigorous manner to defeat the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed deſigns of the enemy, and ſuch diſaffected perſons as may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline to aſſiſt and facilitate their views.—In compliance with their requeſt, and on account of the ſcarcity of money for carrying their ſalutary views into execution, I have agreed to lend them, out of the ſmall ſtock now in hand (not more than ſixty thouſand dollars), twenty thouſand dollars, in part of what they want; which they promiſe ſpeedily to replace.—Had there been money ſufficient for paying the whole of our troops, and no more, I could not have done it. But as it was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe, and by no means proper to pay a part and not the whole, I could not foreſee any inconveniences that would attend the loan;—on the contrary, that it might contribute in ſome degree to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward their ſchemes.—I hope my conduct in this inſtance will not be diſapproved.</p>
                  <p>I incloſed governor Trumbull a copy of their letter and of their ſeveral reſolves, to-day, by colonel Broom and Mr. Duer, two members of the convention, who are going to wait on him; but did not think myſelf at liberty to urge or requeſt his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in forming the camp of ſix thouſand men, as the levies, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by Congreſs to be furniſhed the third of June, for the defence of this place, by that government, are but little more than one third come in. At the ſame time, the propoſition I think a good one, if it could be carried into execution. In caſe the enemy ſhould attempt to effect a landing above Kingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, and to cut off the communication between this city and the country, an army to hang on their rear would diſtreſs them exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly.</p>

                  <p>YOUR favors of the eighteenth and nineteenth, with which you have been pleaſed to honor me, have been duly received, with the ſeveral reſolves alluded to.</p>
                  <p>When the letter and declaration from lord Howe to Mr. Franklin, and the other late governors, come to be publiſhed, I ſhould ſuppoſe the warmeſt advocates for dependence on the Britiſh crown muſt be ſilent, and be convinced beyond all poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of doubt, that all that has been ſaid about the commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners was illuſory, and calculated expreſsly to deceive and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guard, not only the good people of our own country, but thoſe of the Engliſh nation that were averſe to the proceedings of the king and miniſtry. Hence we ſee the cauſe why a ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of their powers was not given the mayor and city of London, on their addreſs requeſting it. That would have been dangerous, becauſe it would then have been manifeſted that the line of conduct they were to purſue would be totally variant from that they had induſtriouſly propagated, and amuſed the public with.—The uniting the civil and military offices in the ſame perſons, too, muſt be concluſive to every thinking one, that there is to be but little negociation of the civil kind.</p>
                  <p>I have incloſed for the ſatisfaction of Congreſs, the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what paſſed between myſelf and lieutenant-colonel Patterſon, adjutant-general, at an interview had yeſterday, in
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:031423_0167_0FEC5A34B81131F8"/>
conſequence of a requeſt from general Howe the day before;—to which I beg leave to refer them for particulars.</p>
                  <p>Colonel Knox of the train having often mentioned to me the neceſſity of having a much more numerous body of artilleriſts than what there now is, in caſe the preſent conteſt ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue longer,—and knowing the deficiency in this inſtance, and their extreme uſefulneſs,—I deſired him to commit his ideas upon the ſubject to writing, in order that I might tranſmit them to Congreſs for their conſideration. Agreeable to my requeſt, he has done it; and the propriety of his plan is now ſubmitted for their deciſion. It is certain that we have not more at this time than are ſufficient for the ſeveral extenſive poſts we now have,—including draughts which he ſpeaks of, and which, I preſume (not only from what he has informed me, but from the nature of the thing,) can never be qualified to render the ſame ſervice as if they were regularly appointed and formed into a corps for that particular purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>I beg leave to remind Congreſs that ſome time ago I laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them the propoſals of ſome perſons here, for forming a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of light-horſe; and the preſident's anſwer a little time after, intimated that the plan ſeemed to be approved of.—As thoſe who wanted to make up the troop are frequently preſſing me for an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, I could wiſh to be favored with the deciſion of Congreſs upon the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>By a letter from general Schuyler, of the fourteenth inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated at Albany, he informs me, that, the day before, ſome deſperate deſigns of the tories in that quarter had been diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered, the particulars of which he could not divulge, being under an oath of ſecrecy;—however, that ſuch meaſures had been taken, as to promiſe a prevention of the intended miſchief: and that four of the conſpirators (among them a ringleader) were apprehended about one o'clock that morning, not far from the town. What the plot was, or who were concerned in it, is a matter I am ignorant of as yet.</p>
                  <p>With my beſt regards to Congreſs, I have the honor to be your and their moſt obedient ſervant.</p>

                  <p>SINCE I had the pleaſure of writing you by this morning's poſt, I was favored with a letter from governor Trumbull, a copy of which is incloſed, and to which I beg leave to refer you.—In regard to the ſtock he mentions, I wrote to him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſting that they might be removed from the iſlands on which they were, as I conceived it of great importance to diſtreſs the enemy as much as poſſible in the article of freſh proviſion.—
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:031423_0169_0FEC5A3B8529EE10"/>
I wiſh the other governments may follow his example, and have it removed from the Iſlands belonging to them reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively.</p>
                  <p>When the ſhips of war and tenders went up the river, it was thought expedient that application ſhould be made for the Connecticut row-gallies and thoſe belonging to Rhode-Iſland, in order to attempt ſomething for their deſtruction. As ſoon as they arrive we ſhall try to employ them in ſome uſeful way,—but in what, or how ſucceſsfully, I cannot at preſent deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine.</p>
                  <p>Congreſs will pleaſe to obſerve what Mr. Trumbull ſays re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the continental regiment raiſing under colonel Ward. If they incline to give any orders about their deſtination, you will pleaſe to communicate them by the earlieſt opportunity, as their march will be ſuſpended till they are known.</p>
                  <p>The orders Mr. Trumbull has given to the officers of their crui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, to ſtop proviſion veſſels, ſeem to be neceſſary. We have too much reaſon to believe that ſome have gone voluntarily to the enemy, and that there are many perſons who would continue to furniſh them with large ſupplies; and, however upright the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions of others may be, it will be a matter of the utmoſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, if not an impoſſibility,—for any to eſcape falling into their hands now, as every part of the coaſt (it is probable) will ſwarm with their ſhips of war and tenders. I had propoſed writing to the convention of this ſtate upon the ſubject before I received his letter; and am now more perſuaded of the neceſſity of their taking ſome ſteps to prevent further exportations down the Sound. In my next I ſhall inform them of the intelligence receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Mr. Trumbull, and recommend the matter to their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>

                  <postscript>
                     <p>It appears abſolutely neceſſary that the exportation of proviſion ſhould be ſtopped. Our army is large, and other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe may want. Nor can individuals be injured, as they have a ready-money market for every thing they have to diſpoſe of in that way.</p>

<pb n="171" facs="unknown:031423_0170_0FEC5A3F003DD808"/>
—the orders to give,—the inſtructions to draw,—cut out more buſineſs than I am able to execute in time with proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. The buſineſs of ſo many different departments centring with me, and by me to be handed on to Congreſs for their information,—added to the intercourſe I am obliged to keep up with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jacent ſtates,—and incidental occurrences,—all of which require confidential and not hack writers to execute,—renders it impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, in the preſent ſtate of things, for my family to diſcharge the ſeveral duties expected of me, with that preciſion and diſpatch that I could wiſh.—What will it be then, when we come into a more active ſcene, and I am called upon from twenty different places perhaps at the ſame inſtant?</p>
                  <p>Congreſs will do me the juſtice to believe (I hope) that it is not my inclination or wiſh to run the continent to any unneceſſary expenſe; and thoſe who better know me will not ſuſpect that ſhow and parade can have any influence on my mind in this inſtance.—A conviction of the neceſſity of it, for the regular diſcharge of the truſt repoſed in me, is the governing motive for the application; and, as ſuch, is ſubmitted to Congreſs by, ſir, your moſt obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>I WAS yeſterday morning honored with your favor of the twenty-fourth inſtant with its ſeveral incloſures, to which I ſhall pay the ſtricteſt attention.</p>
                  <p>The confidence Congreſs are pleaſed to repoſe in my judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment demands my warmeſt acknowledgments, and they may reſt aſſured it ſhall be invariably employed, ſo far as it ſhall be in my power, to promote their views and the public weal.</p>
                  <p>Since my laſt, nothing material has occurred.—Yeſterday even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing report was made that eight ſhips were ſeen in the offing, ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards the Hook. The men-of-war and tenders are ſtill up the river. They have never attempted to paſs the Highland for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications; and a day or two ago, quitted their ſtation, and fell down the river eight or ten miles. The vigilance and activity of the militia oppoſite where they were, have prevented their landing and doing much injury.—One poor peaſant's cot they plundered and then burnt.</p>
                  <p>I would wiſh to know whether the allowance given to offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, the ſeventeenth of January, of a dollar and one third for every man they enliſt, Congreſs mean to extend to the officers
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:031423_0171_0FEC5A42178A69B8"/>
who enliſt for the new army for three years. At firſt it may ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear wrong, or rather exorbitant, ſuppoſing that many will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruited out of the regiments now in ſervice, and under them: but the allowance will be of great uſe, as it will intereſt the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, and call forth their exertions which otherwiſe would be faint and languid. Indeed I am fearful, from the enquiries I have made, that their utmoſt exertions will be attended with but little ſucceſs. It is objected that the bounty of ten dollars is too low; and argued,—"if the ſtates furniſh men for five or ſix months, allow conſiderable more, why ſhould that be accepted when the term of enliſtment is to be for three years?"—I heartily wiſh a bounty in land had been or could be given, as was propoſed ſome time ago. I think it would be attended with ſalutary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences.</p>
                  <p>In conſequence of my application to governor Trumbull, he has ſent me two row-gallies; and I expect another from him. None from governor Cooke are yet come; nor have I heard from him on the ſubject.—One is complete here.—The fire-ſhips are going on under Mr. Anderſon's direction, but rather ſlowly; and I am preparing ſome obſtructions for the channel nearly oppoſite the works at the upper end of this iſland.—When all things are ready, I intend to try, if it ſhall ſeem practicable, to deſtroy the ſhips and tenders above, and to employ the gallies, if they can be of advantage.</p>
                  <p>The militia for the flying camp come in but ſlowly. By a return from general Mercer yeſterday, they are but little more than three thouſand. If they were in, or can be there ſhortly, and the ſituation of the enemy remains the ſame, I would make ſome efforts to annoy them, keeping our poſts here well guarded, and not putting too much to the hazard, or in any manner to the riſk.</p>

                  <p>Our ſtock of muſket-powder is entirely made up into cart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ridges. I therefore requeſt that Congreſs will order four or five tons more of that ſort to be immediately forwarded; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:031423_0172_0FEC5A443460F368"/>
not only neceſſary that we ſhould have more for that purpoſe, but alſo ſome ſtock to remain in barrels.</p>
                  <p>Yeſterday evening Hutchinſon's and Sergeant's regiments from Boſton arrived: alſo two row-gallies from Rhode-Iſland.—I am fearful the troops have not got entirely clear of the ſmall-pox. I ſhall uſe every poſſible precaution to prevent the infection ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and, for that purpoſe, have ordered them to an encampment ſeparate and detached from the reſt.</p>
                  <p>By ſaturday's report from Long-Iſland camp, five ſhips, a brig, and five ſchooners had got into the Hook;—by yeſterday's, two ſhips more, and a ſloop, were ſtanding in.—What they are, I have not been able to learn.</p>
                  <p>I have tranſmitted a general return herewith, by which Congreſs will perceive the whole of our force at the time it was made.</p>
                  <p>I have incloſed you an account of the ſundry prizes, which was tranſmitted to ſeveral gentlemen here by ſaturday's poſt. The two laſt prizes I did not ſee mentioned in the letters ſhewn me; and I fear the report of the ſecond proviſion-veſſel is premature.—I was alſo this minute informed that captain Biddle had taken a ſhip with ſugars, for Britain, and, in bringing her in unfortunately loſt her on Fiſher's-Iſland.</p>

                  <p>I WAS this morning honored with your two favors of yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day's date; and, agreeable to your requeſt, have given Mr. Palfrey liberty to negociate your claim with Mr. Brimmer, and wiſh it might be ſatisfied agreeably to you.</p>
                  <p>I laſt night received a letter from general Schuyler, a copy of which I do myſelf the honor to tranſmit you. You will thereby perceive his reaſons for leaving Crown-Point, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering the poſt the council of officers determined to take oppoſite to Tyconderoga.—I am totally unacquainted with thoſe ſeveral poſts and the country about them, and therefore cannot determine on the validity of his obſervations, or think myſelf at liberty to give any direction on the matter.</p>
                  <p>Congreſs will pleaſe to obſerve what he ſays of their diſtreſs for money. From hence he can have no relief, there being on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly about three or four thouſand dollars in the paymaſter's hands according to his return this morning,—and all but two months pay due to the army, beſides many other demands,—I could
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:031423_0173_0FEC5A47D35FD2D8"/>
wiſh that proper ſupplies of money could be always kept:—the want may occaſion conſequences of an alarming nature.</p>
                  <p>By a letter from him, of a prior date to the copy incloſed, he tells me that a Mr. Ryckman, who has juſt returned through the country of the Six-Nations, reports that the Indians who were at Philadelphia have gone home with very favorable ideas of our ſtrength and reſources. This he heard in many of their vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages:—a lucky circumſtance, if it will either gain their friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip or ſecure their neutrality.</p>
                  <p>In my letter of the twenty-ſeventh I informed Congreſs of my views to attempt ſomething againſt the troops on Staten-Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. I am now to acquaint them, that by the advice of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Mercer and other officers at Amboy, it will be impractica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do any thing upon a large ſcale, for want of craft, and as the enemy have the entire command of water all round the Iſland.—I have deſired general Mercer to have nine or ten flat-bottomed boats built at Newark-bay and Elizabeth-town, with a deſign principally to keep up the communication acroſs Hackinſac and Paſſaic rivers, which I deemed a matter of great importance, and extremely neceſſary to be attended to.</p>
                  <p>Since I wrote you yeſterday, eleven ſhips more, four brigs, and two ſloops, have come into the Hook. I have not yet received Intelligence what any of the late arrivals are: but I ſuppoſe we ſhall not long remain in a ſtate of uncertainty.</p>
                  <p>Having reaſon to believe that lord Howe will readily come into an exchange of ſuch priſoners as may be more immediately under his command, and that ſomething will be offered on this ſubject within a day or two, or rather come in anſwer to the propoſitions I have made general Howe, I ſhould be glad to have Congreſs's interpretation of the reſolves of the twenty-ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond inſtant, empowering the commanders to exchange, &amp;c.—whether, by the word <hi>'ſailor,'</hi> they mean ſailors generally, as well thoſe taken in the veſſels of private adventurers by the enemy, as thoſe belonging to the continental cruiſers, or veſſels in the continent's employ; or whether they only deſign to extend the exchange to the latter,—thoſe in their particular em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy.</p>
                  <p>I would alſo obſerve, that, heretofore, ſailors belonging to merchants ſhips that have fallen into our hands, and thoſe em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed merely as tranſports, have not generally been conſidered as priſoners.—I ſubmit it to Congreſs whether it may not be now neceſſary to paſs a reſolve declaring their ſentiments on this ſubject, and, in general, who are to be treated as priſoners of war, that are taken on board veſſels belonging to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:031423_0174_0FEC5A4AEA253AF8"/>
of the Britiſh crown, &amp;c.—The reſult of their opinion upon the firſt queſtion propoſed, you will pleaſe to tranſmit me by the earlieſt opportunity.</p>
                  <p>I have incloſed, for the conſideration of Congreſs, a memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial and petition by captain Holdridge, praying to be relieved againſt the loſs of money ſtolen from him,—not conceiving my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf authoriſed to grant his requeſt. The certificate which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends it proves him to be a man of character; and his caſe is hard, on his ſtate of it.—Whether making the loſs good may not open a door to others, and give riſe to applications not ſo juſt as his may be, I cannot determine.—That ſeems to be the only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to relieve him.</p>
                  <p>I am informed by general Putnam that there are ſome of the Stockbridge Indians here (I have not ſeen them myſelf) who expreſs great uneaſineſs at their not being employed by us, and have come to enquire into the cauſe. I am ſenſible Congreſs had them not in contemplation when they reſolved that Indians might be engaged in our ſervice. However, as they ſeem ſo anxious,—as they were led to expect it, from what general Schuyler and the other commiſſioners did,—as we are under difficulties in getting men, and there may be danger of their (or ſome of them) taking an unfavorable part, I beg leave to ſubmit it as my opinion, under all theſe circumſtances, that they had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter be employed.</p>

                  <p>Congreſs have been pleaſed to leave with me the direction of colonel Ward's regiment, I have wrote to gevernor Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bull, and requeſted him to order their march to this place, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fully ſatisfied that the enemy mean to make their grand puſh in this quarter, and that the good of the ſervice requires every aid here that can be obtained. I have alſo wrote to colonel Elmore, and directed him to repair hither with his regiment.—When it comes, I ſhall fill up commiſſions for ſuch officers as appear with their reſpective companies.</p>
                  <p>Colonel Holman, with a regiment from the Maſſachuſetts ſtate, is arrived. Colonel Cary from thence is alſo here, wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the arrival of his regiment which he hourly expects.

                  <p>The enemy's force is daily augmenting and becoming ſtron<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger by new arrivals. Yeſterday general Green reports that about forty ſail, including tenders, came into the Hook. What they are, or what thoſe have brought that have lately got in, I remain uninformed.

                  <p>I WAS honored with your favor of the thirty-firſt ultimo on friday, with ſeveral incloſures; and return you my thanks for the agreeable intelligence you were pleaſed to communicate, of the arrival of one of our ſhips with ſuch valuable articles as arms and ammunition; alſo of the capture made by a priva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teer.</p>
                  <p>The mode for the exchange of priſoners, reſolved on by Congreſs, is acceded to by general Howe, ſo far as it comes within his command. A copy of my letter and his anſwer upon this ſubject I have the honor to incloſe you; to which I beg leave to refer Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>The encloſed copy of a letter from colonel Tupper, who had the general command of the gallies, will inform Congreſs of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement between them and the ſhips of war up the North-river, on ſaturday evening, and of the damage we ſuſtained. What in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury was done to the ſhips, I cannot aſcertain. It is ſaid they were hulled ſeveral times by our ſhot. All accounts agree that our officers and men, during the whole of the affair, behaved with great ſpirit and bravery. The damage done the gallies ſhews beyond queſtion, that they had a warm time of it.—The ſhips ſtill remain up the river? and, before any thing further can be attempted againſt them (ſhould it be thought adviſable,) the gallies muſt be repaired.</p>
                  <p>I have alſo tranſmitted Congreſs a copy of a letter I received by ſaturday's poſt from governor Cooke, to which I refer them for the intelligence it contains. The ſeizure of our veſſels by the Portugueſe is, I fear, an event too true. Their dependence upon the Britiſh crown for aid againſt the Spaniards muſt
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:031423_0176_0FEC5A50D7AB3FF8"/>
force them to comply with every thing required of them.—I wiſh the Morris may get ſafe in with her cargo.—As to the ſhips captain Buchlin ſaw on the twenty-fifth ultimo, they are probably arrived: for yeſterday twenty-five ſail came into the Hook.</p>
                  <p>By a letter from general Ward, of the twenty-ninth ultimo, he informs me that two of our armed veſſels, the day before, had brought into Marblehead a ſhip bound from Halifax to Staten-Iſland. She had in about fifteen hundred and nine pounds worth of Britiſh goods, beſides a good many belonging to tories. A Halifax paper, found on board her, I have encloſed, as alſo an account ſent me by Mr. Hazard, tranſmitted him by ſome of his friends, as given by the tories taken in her. The intelligence, I dare ſay, is true, reſpecting the arrival of part of the Heſſian troops. General Ward in his letter mentions, that, the day this prize was taken, captain Burke, in another of our armed veſſels, had an engagement with a ſhip and a ſchooner which he thought were tranſports, and would have taken them, had it not been for an unlucky accident in having his quarter-deck blown up. Two of his men were killed, and ſeveral more were wounded.</p>
                  <p>The hulks and chevaux-de-friſe, that have been preparing to obſtruct the channel<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have got up to the place they are intended for, and will be ſunk as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>I have tranſmitted Congreſs a general return of the army in and about this place on the third inſtant, by which they will perceive the amount of our force.</p>
                  <p>Before I conclude, I would beg leave to remind Congreſs of the neceſſity there is of having ſome major-generals appointed for this army, the duties of which are great, extenſive, and impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be diſcharged as they ought and the good of the ſervice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, without a competent number of officers of this rank. I mean to write more fully upon the ſubject: and, as things are drawing faſt to an iſſue, and it is neceſſary to make every proper diſpoſition and arrangement that we poſſibly can, I pray that this matter may be taken into conſideration, and claim their early at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.—I well know what has prevented appointments of this ſort for ſome time paſt: but the ſituation of our affairs will not juſtify longer delays in this inſtance.—By the firſt opportunity, I ſhall take the liberty of giving you my ſentiments more at large upon the propriety and neceſſity of the meaſure.</p>

                  <p>IN my letter of the fifth, which I had the honor of addreſſing you, I beg leave to recall the attention of Congreſs to the abſolute neceſſity there is for appointing more general officers,—promiſing at the ſame time, by the firſt opportunity, to give my ſentiments more at large upon the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>Confident I am that the poſtponing this meaſure has not proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from motives of frugality: otherwiſe I ſhould take liberty of attempting to prove that we put too much to the hazard of ſuch a ſaving.—I am but too well appriſed of the difficulties that occur in the choice. They are, I acknowledge, great; but at the ſame time it muſt be allowed, they are of ſuch a nature as to preſent themſelves whenever the ſubject is thought of. Time on the one hand does not remove them; on the other delay may be productive of fatal conſequences.</p>
                  <p>This army, though far ſhort as yet of the numbers intended by Congreſs, is by much too unwieldy for the command of any one man, without ſeveral major-generals to aſſiſt. For it is to be obſerved, that a brigadier-general at the head of his bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade, is no more than a colonel at the head of a regiment, except that he acts upon a larger ſcale. Officers of more general com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand are at all times wanted for the good order and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an army, eſpecially when the army is compoſed chiefly of raw troops: but in an action they are indiſpenſably neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary.—At preſent there is but one major-general for this whole department and the flying camp; whereas, at this place alone, leſs than three cannot diſcharge the duties with that regularity they ought to be.</p>
                  <p>If theſe major-generals are appointed, as undoubtedly they will, out of the preſent brigadiers, you will want for this place three brigadiers at leaſt.—The northern department will require one, if not two (as general Thompſon is a priſoner, and the baron Woedtke reported to be dead o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> in a ſtate not much better,) there being at preſent only one brigadier-general (Arnold) in all that department.—For the eaſtern govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments there ought to be one, or a major-general, to ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend the regiments there, and to prevent impoſitions that might otherwiſe be practiſed.—Theſe make the number wanted to be ſix or ſeven: and who are to be appointed, Congreſs can beſt judge.</p>
                  <p>To make brigadiers of the oldeſt colonels would be the leaſt exceptionable way: but it is much to be queſtioned, whether by that mode the ableſt men would be appointed to office.
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:031423_0178_0FEC5A5A438F7408"/>
And I would obſerve, though the rank of the colonels of the eaſtern governments was ſettled at Cambridge laſt year, it only reſpected themſelves, and is ſtill open as to officers of other governments. To pick a colonel here and a colonel there through the army, according to the opinion entertained of their abilities, would no doubt be the means of making a better choice, and nominating the fitteſt perſons: but then the ſenior officers would get diſguſted, and, more than probable, with their connexions, quit the ſervice.—That might prove fatal at this time.—To appoint gentlemen as brigadiers that had not ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in this army (in this part of it at leaſt,) would not wound any one in particular, but hurt the whole equally, and muſt be conſidered in a very diſcouraging light by every officer of merit.—View the matter therefore in any point of light you will, there are inconveniencies on the one hand, and difficulties on the other, which ought to be avoided.—Would they be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medied by appointing the oldeſt colonels from each ſtate?—If this mode ſhould be thought expedient, the encloſed liſt gives the names of the colonels, from New-Hampſhire to Pennſylvania incluſive, ſpecifying thoſe who rank firſt, as I am told, in the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral colony liſts.</p>
                  <p>I have tranſmitted a copy of a letter from Mr. John Glover, ſetting forth the nature and grounds of a diſpute between him and a Mr. Bradford, reſpecting their agency, not conceiving myſelf authoriſed, nor having the ſmalleſt inclination to interfere in any degree in the matter, it is referred to Congreſs, who will determine and give direction upon it in ſuch manner as they ſhall judge beſt. I will only obſerve, that Mr. Glover was recommended to me as a proper perſon for an agent, when we firſt fitted out armed veſſels, and was accordingly appointed one; and ſo far as I know, diſcharged his office with fidelity and induſtry.</p>
                  <p>I received yeſterday evening a letter from general Schuyler, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining lieutenant M'Michael's report, who had been ſent a ſcout to Oſwego. A copy of the report I have encloſed for the inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Congreſs, leſt general Schuyler ſhould have omitted it in his letter which accompanies this. He was at the German-Flatts when he wrote, which was the ſecond inſtant, and the treaty with the Indians not begun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> nor had the whole expected, then arrived.—But of theſe things he will have adviſed you more fully, I make no doubt.</p>
                  <p>The paymaſter informs me he received a ſupply of money yeſterday. It came very ſeaſonably: for the applications and
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:031423_0179_0FEC5A5C101BF278"/>

                  <p>SINCE cloſing the letter which I had the honor to write you this morning, two deſerters have come in, who left the Solebay man-of-war laſt evening. One of them is a native of New-York. Their account is that they were in the engagement with colonel Moultrie at Sullivan's Iſland on the ninth of July—(the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars they give nearly correſpond with the narrative ſent by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Lee;)—that they left Carolina three weeks ago as a convoy to forty-five tranſports, having on board general Clinton, lord Cornwallis, and the whole ſouthern army, conſiſting of about three thouſand men, all of whom were landed laſt week on Sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten-Iſland in tolerable health;—that, on ſunday, thirteen tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, part of lord Howe's fleet, and having on board Heſſians and Highlanders, came to Staten-Iſland;—that the remainder of the fleet, which was reported to have, in the whole, twelve thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand men, had parted with theſe troops off the banks of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foundland, and were expected to come in every moment;—that they were getting their heavy carriages and cannon on board, had launched eight gondolas with flat-bottoms, and two rafts or ſtages to carry cannon.</p>
                  <p>Theſe men underſtand that the attack will ſoon be made if the other troops arrive:—that they give out they will lay the Jerſeys waſte with fire and ſword;—that the computed ſtrength of their army will be thirty thouſand men. They further add, that when they left Carolina, one tranſport got on ſhore, ſo that they were not able to give her relief; upon which, ſhe ſurrendered, with five companies of Highlanders, to general Lee, who, after taking every thing valuable out of her, burnt her;—that the admiral turned general Clinton out of his ſhip after the engagement with a great deal of abuſe;—great differences between the principal naval and military gentlemen;—that the ſhips left in Carolina, are now in ſuch a weakly diſtreſſed condition, they would fall an eaſy prey.</p>

                  <p>As the propoſition for employing the Stockbridge Indians has been approved, I have wrote to Mr. Edwards, one of the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners, and who lives among them, requeſting him to engage them, or ſuch as are willing, to enter the ſervice. I have directed him to indulge them with liberty to join this or the northern army, or both, as their inclinations may lead.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh the ſalutary conſequences may reſult from the regulation reſpecting ſeamen taken, that Congreſs have in view. From the nature of this kind of people, and the privileges granted on their entering into our ſervice, I ſhould ſuppoſe many of them will do it.—We want them much.</p>
                  <p>I yeſterday tranſmitted the intelligence I received from the deſerters from the Solebay man-of-war.—The incloſed copy of a letter by laſt night's poſt, from the honorable Mr. Bowdoin, with the information of a captain Kennedy lately taken, corro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borate their accounts reſpecting the Heſſian troops. Indeed his report makes the fleet and armament, to be employed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, greater then we have heard they would be. Howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, there remains no doubt of their being both large and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midable, and ſuch as will require our moſt vigorous exertions to oppoſe them. Perſuaded of this, and knowing how much inferior our numbers are and will be to theirs when the whole of their troops arrive,—of the important conſequences that may and will flow from the appeal that will ſoon be made—I have wrote to Connecticut and New-Jerſey, for all the ſuccour they can afford, and alſo to the convention of this ſtate.—What I may receive, and in what time, the event muſt determine. But I would fain hope, the ſituation and the exigency of our affairs will call forth the moſt ſtrenuous efforts and early aſſiſtance of thoſe who are friends to the cauſe. I confeſs there is but too much occaſion for their exertions. I confidently truſt they will not be withheld.</p>
                  <p>I have incloſed a copy of a letter from Mr. Bowdoin reſpect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the eaſtern Indians. Congreſs will thereby perceive that they profeſs themſelves to be well attached to our intereſt,—
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:031423_0181_0FEC5A619CB7A770"/>
and the ſummary of the meaſures taken to engage them in our ſervice. I have the treaty at large between the honorable council of the Maſſachuſetts, on behalf of the United States, with the delegates of the St. John's and Mikmac tribes. The proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of a copy's being ſent already, and its great length, prevent one coming herewith. If Congreſs had it not forwarded to them, I will ſend a copy by the firſt opp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rtunity after notice that it has not been received.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Auguſt</hi> 9.—By a report received from general Greene laſt night, at ſunſet and a little after, about a hundred boats were ſeen bringing troops from Staten-Iſland to the ſhips, three of which had fallen down towards the Narrows, having taken in ſoldiers from thirty of the boats. He adds, that, by the beſt obſervations of ſeveral officers, there appeared to be a general embarkation.</p>
                  <p>I have wrote to general Mercer for two thouſand men from the flying camp. Colonel Smallwood's battalion, as part of them, I expect this forenoon: but where the reſt are to come from, I know not, as, by the general's laſt return, not more than three or four hundred of the new levies had got in.</p>
                  <p>In my letter of the fifth I incloſed a general return of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my under my immediate command, but I imagine the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtate will give Congreſs a more perfect idea, though not a more agreeable one, of our ſituation, For the ſeveral poſts on New-York, Long and Governor's Iſlands, and Paulus-Hook, we have, fit for duty, ten thouſand five hundred and fourteen,—ſick preſent, three thouſand and thirty-nine—ſick abſent, ſix hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and twenty-nine,—on command, two thouſand nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and forty ſix,—on furlough, ninety-ſeven,—total, ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen thouſand two hundred and twenty-five. In addition to theſe, we are only certain of colonel Smallwood's battalion in caſe of an immediate attack. Our poſts are too much divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, having waters between many of them, and ſome diſtant from others, fifteen miles. Theſe circumſtances, ſufficiently diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of themſelves, are much aggravated by the ſickneſs that prevails through the army. Every day more or leſs are ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken down; ſo that the proportion of men that may come in can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be conſidered as a real and ſerviceable augmentation on the whole.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things are melancholy; but they are nevertheleſs true. I hope for better.—Under every diſadvantage, my utmoſt exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhall be employed to bring about the great end we have in view: and, ſo far as I can judge from the profeſſions and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parant diſpoſition of my troops, I ſhall have their ſupport. The
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:031423_0182_0FEC5A8BB14C1E00"/>
ſuperiority of the enemy and the expected attack do not ſeem to have depreſſed their ſpirits. Theſe conſiderations lead me to think, that, though the appeal may not terminate ſo happily in our favor as I could wiſh, yet they will not ſucceed in their views without conſiderable loſs. Any advantage they may get, I truſt, will coſt them dear.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>By the reverend Mr. Madiſon and a Mr. Johnſon, two gentlemen of Virginia who came from Staten-Iſland yeſterday, where they arrived the day before in the packet with colonel Guy Johnſon, I am informed that nothing material had taken place in England when they left it;—that there had been a change in the French miniſtry, which, many people thought, foreboded a war:—that it ſeemed to be believed by many that Congreſs would attempt to buy off the foreign troops, and that it might be effected without great difficulty. Their accounts from Staten-Iſland nearly correſpond with what we had before: they ſay that every preparation is making for an attack;—that the force now upon the Iſland is about fifteen thouſand;—that they appear very impatient for the arrival of the foreign troops, but a very ſmall part having got in. Whether they would at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt any thing before they come, they are uncertain: but they are ſure they will as ſoon as they arrive, if not before.—They ſay, from what they could collect from the converſation of officers, &amp;c. they mean to hem us in by getting above us and cut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting off all communication with the country.</p>
                  <p>That this is their plan, ſeems to be corroborated and confirmed by the circumſtance of ſome ſhips of war going out at different times within a few days paſt, and other veſſels. It is probable that a part are to go round and come up the Sound.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Madiſon ſays lord How's powers were not known when he left England;—that general Conway moved, before his depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, that they might be laid before the commons; and had his motion rejected by a large majority.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE been duly honored with your favors of the eighth and tenth inſtant, with the ſeveral incloſures. I ſhall pay attention to the reſolution reſpecting lieutenant Joſiah, and attempt to relieve him from his rigorous uſage,—Your letters to
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:031423_0183_0FEC5A65957F7E88"/>
ſuch of the gentlemen as were here have been delivered. The reſt will be ſent by the firſt opportunity.</p>
                  <p>Since my laſt of the eighth and ninth, the enemy have made no movements of conſequence. They remain nearly in the ſame ſtate; nor have we any further intelligence of their deſigns. They have not been yet joined by the remainder of the fleet with the Heſſian troops</p>
                  <p>Colonel Small wood and his battalion got in on friday; and colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Miles is alſo here with two battalions more of Pennſylvanian riflemen.</p>
                  <p>The convention of thir ſtate have been exerting themſelves to call forth a portion of their militia to an encampment form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above Kingſbridge, to remain in ſervice for the ſpace of one month after their arrival there; and alſo half of thoſe in King and Queen's counties, to reinforce the troops on Long-Iſland till the firſt of September, unleſs ſooner diſcharged. General Morris too is to take poſt with his brigade on the Sound and Hudſon's-river for ten days, to annoy the enemy in caſe they attempt to land; and others of their militia are directed to be in readineſs, in caſe their aid ſhould be required. Upon the whole, from the information I have from the convention, the militia ordered are now in motion, or will be in a little time, and will amount to about three thouſand or more. From Connecticut, I am not certain what ſuccours are coming. By one or two gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who have come from thence, I am told ſome of the militia are aſſembling, and, from the intelligence they had, would march this week.</p>
                  <p>By a letter from governor Trumbull, of the fifth, I am adviſed that the troops from that ſtate, deſtined for the northern ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, had marched for Skeneſborough.—General Ward too, by a letter of the fourth, informs me that the regiments would march from Boſton laſt week, having been cleanſed and gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erally recovered from the ſmall-pox. I have alſo countermand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed my orders to colonel Elmore, and directed him to join the northern army, having heard, after my orders to Connecticut for his marching hither, that he and moſt of his regiment were at Albany or within its vicinity,—General Ward mentions that the council of the Maſſachuſetts ſtate will have in from two or three thouſand of their militia to defend their lines and different poſts, in lieu of the regiments ordered from thence agreeable to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution of Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>The incloſed copy of a reſolve of this ſtate, paſſed the renth inſtant, will diſcover the apprehenſion they are under of the defec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the inhabitants of Kings' county from the common cauſe,
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:031423_0184_0FEC5A6B4D5A51D8"/>
and of the meaſures they have taken thereupon. I have directed general Greene to give the committee ſuch aſſiſtance as he can, and they may require, in the execution of their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion; though at the ſame time, I wiſh the information the convention have received upon the ſubject may prove ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs.</p>
                  <p>I would beg leave to mention to Congreſs, that, in a letter I received from general Lee, he mentions the valuable conſequences that would reſult from a number of cavalry being employed in the ſouthern department. Without them (to uſe his own expreſſions) he can anſwer for nothing:—with one thouſand he would enſure the ſafety of thoſe ſtates.—I ſhould have done myſelf the honor of ſubmitting this matter to Congreſs before, at his particular requeſt, had it not eſcaped my mind.—From his acquaintance with that country, and the nature of the grounds, I doubt not he has weighed the matter well and preſume he has fully repreſented the advantages that would ariſe from the eſtabliſhment of ſuch a corps—all I mean, is, in compliance with his requiſition, to mention the matter, that ſuch conſideration may be had upon it (if not already determined) as it may be deſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of.</p>
                  <p>I have tranſmitted a general return, whereby Congreſs will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the whole of our ſtrength, except the two battalions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der colonel Miles, which, coming ſince it was made out, are not included.</p>
                  <p>I have incloſed a letter juſt come to hand from Martinique. Congreſs will pleaſe to conſider of the purport, favoring me with their anſwer and a return of the letter.</p>
                  <p>This moment (ten o'clock) report is made by general Greene that a man-of-war came in yeſterday, and that ſixty fail of ſhips are now ſtanding in.—No doubt they are a further part of the Heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian fleet.</p>

                  <p>AS there is reaſon to believe that but little time will elapſe before the enemy make their attack, I have thought it adviſable to remove all the papers in my hands, reſpecting the affairs of the ſtates, from this place.

                  <p>The enemy, ſince my letter of yeſterday, have received a furher augmentation of thirty-ſix ſhips to their fleet, making the whole that have arrived ſince yeſterday morning, ninety<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſix.</p>

                  <p>SINCE I had the honor of addreſſing you on monday, no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of importance has occurred here, except that the enemy have received an augmentation to their fleet, of ninety-ſix ſhips:—ſome reports make them more. In a letter I wrote you yeſterday by lieutenant-colonel Reed, I adviſed you of this: but preſuming it may not reach you ſo ſoon as this will, I have thought proper to mention the intelligence again.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed I have the honor to tranſmit a copy of the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of a deſerter, ſent me this morning by general Mercer,
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:031423_0186_0FEC5A732631FFF8"/>
to which I beg leave to refer Congreſs for the lateſt accounts I have from the enemy. Whether the intelligence he has given is literally true, I cannot determine: but as to the attack, we daily expect it.</p>
                  <p>Your favor of the tenth, with its incloſures, was duly received; and I have inſtructed the ſeveral officers who were promoted, to act in their ſtations as you requeſted, though their commiſſions were not ſent.</p>
                  <p>As we are in extreme want of tents and covering for this army,—a great part of thoſe at the out-poſts having nothing to ſhelter them, nor houſes to go into,—I ſubmit it to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs whether it may not be prudent to remand thoſe that were lately ſent to Boſton, where there are no troops at preſent; and, if there were, the neceſſity for them would not be great, as the town, and barracks at ſeveral of the poſts, would be ſufficient to receive them.</p>
                  <p>The incloſed letter from lieutenant-colonel Henſhaw will diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover to Congreſs his views and wiſhes, which they will conſider and determine on, in whatever way they think right and condu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cive to the public good; meaning only to lay his letter be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them.</p>
                  <p>I take the liberty of mentioning that colonel Varnum of Rhode-Iſland has been with me this morning to reſign his commiſſion, conceiving himſelf to be greatly injured in not having been noticed in the late arrangement and promotion of general officers.—I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrated againſt the impropriety of the meaſure at this time; and he has conſented to ſtay till affairs wear a different aſpect from what they do at preſent.</p>

                  <p>It is with peculiar regret and concern that I have an op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of mentioning to Congreſs the ſickly condition of our troops. In ſome regiments there are not any of the field-officers capable of doing duty; in others the duty is extremely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult for want of a ſufficient number. I have been obliged to nominate ſome till Congreſs tranſmit the appointments of thoſe they wiſh to ſucceed to the ſeveral vacancies occaſioned by the late promotions. This, being a matter of ſome conſequence, I preſume will have their early attention, and that they will fill up the ſeveral vacancies alſo mentioned in the liſt I had the honor of tranſmitting ſome few days ago to the board of war.</p>

                  <p>THE circumſtances of the two armies having undergone no material alteration ſince I had the honor of writing to you laſt, I have nothing particular or important to communicate reſpecting them.</p>
                  <p>In my letter of yeſterday I forget to mention the arrival of lord Dunmore here. By the examination of captain Hunter (who eſcaped from the enemy, and came to Amboy on the fourteenth) tranſmitted me by general Roberdeau, I am cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly informed his lordſhip arrived on the thirteenth. The ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amination does not ſay any thing about the ſhips he brought with him: it only extends to his force, which it mentions to be weak.</p>
                  <p>I before now expected the enemy would have made their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack: nor can I account for their deferring it, unleſs the intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, given by captain Hunter and another perſon who eſcaped about the ſame time, is the cauſe,—to wit, that they are waiting the arrival of another diviſion of the Heſſian troops, which (they ſay) is ſtill out. Whether that is the reaſon of the delay, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not undertake to determine: but I ſhould ſuppoſe things will not long remain in their preſent ſtate.—I have encloſed a copy of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Roberdeau's letter, and of the examination of thoſe two perſons, which will ſhew Congreſs all the information they have given upon theſe ſubjects.</p>
                  <p>I am juſt now adviſed by Mr. Aires who came from Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia to build the row-gallies, that two of our fire-veſſels at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted laſt night to burn the enemy's ſhips and tenders up the river. He ſays that they burned one tender, and one of them boarded the Phoenix, and was grappled with her for near ten minutes; but ſhe cleared herſelf.—We loſt both of the veſſels. His account is not ſo particular as I could wiſh; however, I am certain the attempt has not ſucceeded to our wiſhes. In a little time it is probable the matter will be more minutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE been honored with your favor of the ſixteenth with the incloſure, and am ſorry it is not in my power to tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit Congreſs a copy of the treaty as they require, having ſent it away with the other papers that were in my hands.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="190" facs="unknown:031423_0189_0FEC5A796D67FA48"/>
The reſolution they have entered into reſpecting the foreign troops, I am purſuaded, would produce ſalutary effects, if it could be properly circulated among them. I fear it will be a matter of difficulty. However I will take every meaſure that ſhall appear probable to faciliate the end.</p>
                  <p>I have the honor to incloſe you, for the peruſal and conſideration of Congreſs, ſundry papers marked No. 1 to No. 7 incluſive, the whole of which, except No. 2 and 7 (my anſwers to lord Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond and general Howe) I received yeſterday evening by a flag, and to which I beg leave to refer Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>I am exceedingly at a loſs to know the motives and cauſes in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing a proceeding of ſuch a nature at this time, and why lord Howe has not attempted ſome plan of negociation before, as he ſeems ſo deſirous of it. If I may be allowed to conjecture and gueſs at the cauſe, it may be that part of the Heſſians have not arrived, as mentioned in the examination tranſmitted yeſterday,—or that general Burgoyne has not made ſuch progreſs as was ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, to form a junction of their two armies,—or, what I think equally probable, they mean to procraſtinate their operations for ſome time, truſting that the militias which have come to our ſuccour, will ſoon become tired and return home, as is but too uſual with them.—Congreſs will make their obſervations upon theſe ſeveral matters, and favor me with the reſult as ſoon as they have done.—They will obſerve my anſwer to lord Drummond, who (I am pretty confident) has not attended to the terms of his parole, but has violated it in ſeveral inſtances. It is with the reſt of the papers: but, if my memory ſerves me, he was not to hold any correſpondence directly or indirectly with thoſe in arms againſt us, or to go into any port or harbor in America, where the enemy themſelves were or had a fleet, or to go on board their ſhips.</p>
                  <p>The treaty with the Indians is in the box which lieutenant-colonel Reed, I preſume, has delivered before this. If Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs are deſirous of ſeeing it, they will be pleaſed to have the box opened. It contains a variety of papers, and all the affairs of the army, from my firſt going to Cambridge, till it was ſent away.</p>
                  <p>This morning, the Phoenix and Roſe men-of-war, with two tenders, availing themſelxes of a favorable and briſk wind, came down the river, and have joined the fleet. Our ſeveral batteries fired at them in their paſſage, but without any good effect that I could perceive.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE nothing of moment to communicate to Congreſs, as things are in the ſituation they were in when I had laſt the honor of addreſſing them.</p>
                  <p>By a letter from general Ward, of the twelfth, I find that Whit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comb's regiment, on the eighth, and Phinney's on the ninth, marched from Boſton for Tyconderoga.</p>
                  <p>Governor Trumbull alſo, in a letter of the thirteenth, adviſes me that Ward's regiment in the ſervice of the ſtates was on the march to this army, and that he and his council of ſafety had in the whole ordered fourteen militia regiments to reinforce us. Three of them have arrived, and amount to about a thouſand and twenty men. When the whole come in, we ſhall be on a much more reſpectable footing than we have been: but I greatly fear, if the enemy defer their attempt for any conſiderable time, they will be extremely impatient to return home; and if they ſhould, we ſhall be reduced to diſtreſs again.</p>
                  <p>He alſo adds that captain Van Buren, who had been ſent for that purpoſe had procured a ſufficient ſupply of ſail-cloth for the veſſels to be employed on the lake, and a part of the cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage, in that ſtate: and had a proſpect of getting the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der.</p>
                  <p>As there will be a difficulty in all probability to circulate the papers deſigned for the foreign troops, and many miſcarriages may happen before it can be effected, it may be proper to furniſh me with a larger quantity than what I already have.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed I have the honor to tranſmit you a general return of our whole force at this time, in which are comprehended the three re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments of militia above mentioned.

                  <p>I WAS yeſterday morning favored with yours of the ſeven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, accompanied by ſeveral reſolutions of Congreſs, and commiſſions for officers appointed to the late vacancies in this army.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="192" facs="unknown:031423_0191_0FEC5A8553AD79C0"/>
I wrote ſome days ago to general Schuyler to propoſe to generals Carleton and Burgoyne an exchange of priſoners in conſequence of a former reſolve of Congreſs authoriſing their commanders in each department to negociate one. That of major Meigs for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor French, and captain Dearborn's for any officer of equal rank, I ſubmitted to general Howe's conſideration, by letter, on the ſeventeenth, underſtanding their paroles had been ſent him by general Carleton; but have not yet received his anſwer upon the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect to the exchange of the priſoners in Canada, if a propoſition on that head has not been already made (and I believe it has not), the incloſed copy of general Carleton's orders (tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted me under ſeal by major Bigelow, who was ſent with a flag to general Burgoyne from Tyconderoga, with the proceedings of Congreſs on the breach of capitulation at the Cedars, and the inhuman treatment of our people afterwards) will ſhew it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary, as he has determined to ſend them to their own provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, their to remain as priſoners; interdicting at the ſame time all kind of intercourſe between us and his army, except ſuch as may be for the purpoſe of imploring the king's mercy.—The aſſaſſination he mentions, of brigadier-general Gordon, is a fact entirely new to me, and what I never heard of before.—I ſhall not trouble Congreſs with my ſtrictures upon this * * * perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mance, * * * only obſerving that its deſign is ſomewhat artful, and that each boatman with major Bigelow was furniſhed with a copy.</p>
                  <p>I have alſo tranſmitted Congreſs a copy of the major's journal, to which I beg leave to refer them for the intelligence reported by him on his return from the truce.</p>
                  <p>By a letter from general Greene yeſterday evening, he informed me he had received an expreſs from Hog-Iſland inlet, adviſing that five of the enemy's ſmall veſſels had appeared at the mouth of the creek, with ſome troops on board;—alſo that he had heard two periaguas were off Oyſter-Bay,—the whole ſuppoſed to be after live ſtock:—and, to prevent their getting it, he had detached a party of horſe, and two hundred and twenty men, among them twenty riflemen. I have not received further intelligence upon the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>I am alſo adviſed by the examination of a captain Button (maſter of a veſſel that had been taken) tranſmitted me by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Mercer, that the general report among the enemy's troops, when he came off, was, that they were to attack Long-Iſland, and to ſecure our works there if poſſible, at the ſame time another part of their army was to land above this city.
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:031423_0192_0FEC5A876D033950"/>
This information is corroborated by many other accounts, and is probably true: nor will it be poſſible to prevent them landing on the iſland, as its great extent affords a variety of places favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for that purpoſe, and the whole of our works on it are at the end oppoſite to the city. However, we ſhall attempt to harraſs them as much as poſſible, which will be all that we can do.—I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>Though the intelligence reported by the ſpy on his return to governor Livingſton has not been confirmed by the event he menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons (an attack laſt night,) there is every reaſon to believe that one is ſhortly deſigned. The falling down of ſeveral ſhips yeſterday evening to the Narrows, crowded with men,—thoſe ſucceeded by many more this morning,—and a great number of boats parading around them (as I was juſt now informed) with troops,—are all circumſtances indicating an attack: and it is not improbable it will be made to-day. It could not have happened laſt night, by reaſon of a moſt violent guſt.</p>
                  <p>We are making every preparation to receive them; and I truſt, under the ſmiles of Providence, with our own exertions, that my next, if they do attack, will tranſmit an account that will be pleaſing to every friend of America, and of the rights of human<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity.</p>

                  <p>I BEG leave to inform Congreſs, that, yeſterday morning and in the courſe of the preceding night, a conſiderable body of the enemy, amounting by report, to eight or nine thouſand, and theſe all Britiſh, landed from the tranſport-ſhips mentioned in my laſt, at Graveſend-bay on Long-Iſland, and have approached within three miles of our lines, having marched acroſs the low cleared grounds near the woods at Flat-buſh, where they are halted, ſince my laſt intelligence.</p>
                  <p>I have detached from hence ſix battalions as a reinforcement to our troops there, which are all that I can ſpare at this time, not knowing but the fleet may move up with the remainder of their army, and make an attack here, on the next flood-tide. If they do not, I ſhall ſend a further reinforcement, ſhould it be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary; and have ordered five battalions more to be in readineſs for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>I have no doubt but a little time will produce ſome important events. I hope they will be happy.—The reinforcement de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached yeſterday went off in high ſpirits; and I have the pleaſure to inform you that the whole of the army, that are effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive and capable of duty, diſcover the ſame, and great cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.—I have been obliged to appoint major general Sullivan to the command on the iſland, owing to general Greene's indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;—he has been extremely ill for ſeveral days, and ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nues bad.</p>

                  <p>THE irregularity of the poſt prevents your receiving the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and conſtant intelligence it is my wiſh to communicate. This is the third letter which you will probably receive from me by the ſame poſt. The firſt was of little or no conſequence:
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:031423_0194_0FEC5A8EE5D541C8"/>
but that of yeſterday gave you the beſt information I had been able to obtain, of the enemy's landing and movements upon Long-Iſland.—Having occaſion to go over thither yeſterday, I ſent my letter to the poſt-office at the uſual hour, being informed that the rider was expected every moment, and would out again di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly: but in the evening when I ſent to inquire, none had come in.</p>
                  <p>I now incloſe you a report made to me by general Sullivan after I left Long-Iſland yeſterday. I do not conceive that the enemy's whole force was in motion, but a detached party rather. I have ſent over four more regiments, with boats, to be ready either to reinforce the troops under general Sullivan, or to return to this place, if the remainder of the fleet at the watering-place ſhould puſh up to the city; which hitherto (I mean ſince the landing upon Long-Iſland) they have not had in their power to do, on account of the wind which has either been ahead or too ſmall when the tide has ſerved. I have nothing further to trouble the Congreſs with at preſent, than that I am theirs and your moſt obedient hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſervant,</p>

                  <p>I HAVE been duly honored with your favors of the twentieth and twenty-fourth, and am happy to find my anſwer to lord Drum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond has met the approbation of Congreſs. Whatever his views were, moſt certainly his conduct reſpecting his parole is highly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſible.</p>
                  <p>Since my letter of the twenty-fourth, almoſt the whole of the enemy's fleet have fallen down to the Narrows; and, from this circumſtance, and the ſtriking of their tents at their ſev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral encampments on Staten-Iſland from time to time, previous to the departure of the ſhips from thence, we are led to think they mean to land the main body of their army on Long-Iſland, and to make their grand puſh there. I have ordered over conſid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erable reinforcements to our troops there, and ſhall continue to ſend more as circumſtances may require. There has been a little ſkirmiſhing and irregular ſiring kept up between their and our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced guards, in which colonel Martin of the Jerſey levies has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a wound in his breaſt, which, it is apprehended, will prove mortal; a private has had his leg broke by a cannon-ball, and another has received a ſhot in the groin from their muſketry. This is all the damage they have yet done us;—what they have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained, is not known.</p>

                     <pb n="196" facs="unknown:031423_0195_0FEC5A90A0E58240"/>
The ſhifting and changing the regiments have undergone of late has prevented their making proper returns, and of courſe put it out of my power to tranſmit a general one of the army. However, I believe our ſtrength is much the ſame as it was when the laſt was made, with the addition of nine militia regiments come from the ſtate of Connecticut, averaging about three hundred and fifty men each. Theſe are nine of the fourteen regiments mentioned in my letter of the nineteenth.—Our people ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue to be very ſickly.</p>
                  <p>The papers deſigned for the foreign troops have been put into ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral channels, in order that they might be conveyed to them; and, from the information I had yeſterday, I have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve many have fallen into their hands.</p>
                  <p>I have incloſed a copy of lord Drummonds ſecond letter (in anſwer to mine) which I received ſince I tranſmitted his firſt, and which I have thought neceſſary to lay before Congreſs, that they may poſſeſs the whole of the coreſpondence between us, and ſee how far he has exculpated himſelf from the charge alledged againſt him. The log-book he mentions to have ſent colonel Moy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay proves nothing in his favor. That ſhews that he had been at Bermuda, and from thence to ſome other iſland, on his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from which to this place, the veſſel he was in was boarded by a pilot who brought her into the Hook, where he found the Britiſh fleet, which his lordſhip avers he did not expect were there, having underſtood their deſtination was to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward.</p>

                  <p>I THIS minute return from our lines on Long-Iſland, where I left his excellency the general. From him I have it in command to inform Congreſs, that yeſterday he went there, and continued till evening, when from the enemy's having landed a conſiderable part of their forces,—and many of their movements,—there was reaſon to apprehend they would make in a little time a general attack.—As they would have a wood to paſs through before they could approach the lines, it was thought expedient to place a number of men there on the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:031423_0196_0FEC5A93F7AF62E8"/>
roads leading from where they were ſtationed, in order to harraſs and annoy them in their march.—This being done, early this morning a ſmart engagement enſued between the enemy and our detachments, which, being unequal to the force they had to contend with, have ſuſtained a pretty conſiderable loſs: at leaſt many of our men are miſſing. Among thoſe that have not returned, are general Sullivan and lord Sterling. The enemy's loſs is not known certainly: but we are told by ſuch of our troops as were in the engagement and have come in that they had many killed and wounded.—Our party brought off a lieutenant, ſerjeant and corporal, with twenty privates, pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners.</p>
                  <p>While theſe detachments were engaged, a column of the enemy deſcended from the woods, and marched towards the centre of our lines with a deſign to make an impreſſion, but were repulſed. This evening they appeared very numerous about the ſkirts of the woods, where they have pitched ſeveral tents: and his excellency inclines to think they mean to attack and force us from our lines by way of regular approaches, rather than in any other manner.</p>
                  <p>To-day five ſhips of the line came up towards the town, where they ſeemed deſirous of getting, as they turned a long time againſt an unfavorable wind: and on my return this evening, I found a deſerter from the twenty-third regiment, who informed me that they deſign as ſoon as the wind will permit them to come up to give us a ſevere cannonade, and to ſilence our batteries, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>

                  <p>I WAS laſt night honored with your favor of the twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeventh, accompanied by ſundry reſolutions of Congreſs. Thoſe reſpecting the officers, &amp;c. that may be wounded in the ſervice of the ſtates, are founded much in juſtice, and (I ſhould hope) may be productive of many ſalutary conſequences. As to the encouragement to the Heſſian officers, I wiſh it may have the deſir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed effect. Perhaps it might have been better, had the offer been ſooner made.</p>
                  <p>Before this you will probably have received a letter from Mr. Harriſon, of the twenty-ſeventh, adviſing of the engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between a detachment of our men and the enemy on that
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:031423_0197_0FEC5A95932C6E98"/>
day.—I am ſorry to inform Congreſs that I have not heard ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of general Sullivan or lord Sterling, who (they would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve) were among the miſſing after the engagement; nor can I aſcertain our loſs. I am hopeful, part of our men will yet get in: ſeveral did yeſterday morning.—That of the enemy is alſo uncertain: the accounts are various. I incline to think they ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered a good deal. Some deſerters ſay five hundred were killed and wounded.</p>
                  <p>There were ſome ſkirmiſhing, the greateſt part of yeſterday, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween parties from the enemy and our people: in the evening it was pretty ſmart. The event I have not yet learned.</p>
                  <p>The weather of late has been extremely wet. Yeſterday it rained ſeverely the whole afternoon, which diſtreſſed our people much,—not having a ſufficiency of tents to cover them, and what we have, not being got over yet. I am in hopes they will all be got to day, and that they will be more comfortably pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, though the great ſcarcity of theſe articles diſtreſſes us beyond meaſure, not having any thing like a ſufficient number to protect our people from the inclemency of the weather:—which has occaſioned much ſickneſs, and the men to be almoſt broken down.</p>

                  <p>INCLINATION as well as duty would have induced me to give Congreſs the earlieſt information of my removal and that of the troops, from Long-Iſland and its dependencies, to this city, the night before laſt: but the extreme fatigue which my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and family have undergone, as much from the weather ſince as the engagement of the twenty-ſeventh, rendered me and them entirely unfit to take pen in hand. Since monday, ſcarce any of us have been out of the lines till our paſſage along the Eaſt-river was effected yeſterday morning; and for forty-eight hours preceding that I had hardly been off my horſe, and never cloſed my eyes: ſo that I was quite unfit to write or dictate till this mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning.</p>
                  <p>Our retreat was made without any loſs of men or ammuniti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and in better order than I expected from troops in the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation ours were. We brought off all our cannon and ſtores, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept a few heavy pieces, which in the condition the earth was by a long-continued rain, we found, upon trial, impracticable. The wheels of the carriages ſinking up to the hobs, rendered it
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:031423_0198_0FEC5A9E0B611218"/>
impoſſible for our whole force to drag them.—We left but little proviſions on the iſland, except ſome cattle which had been driven within our lines, and which after many attempts to force acroſs the water, we found impoſſible to effect, circumſtanced as we were.</p>
                  <p>I have incloſed a copy of the council of war held previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the retreat, to which I beg leave to refer Congreſs for the reaſons, or many of them, that led to the adoption of that mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                  <p>Yeſterday evening and laſt night, a party of our men were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in bringing our ſtores, cannon, tents, &amp;c. from Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or's-Iſland, which they nearly completed. Some of the heavy cannon remain there ſtill, but (I expect) will be got away to-day.</p>
                  <p>In the engagement on the twenty-ſeventh, generals Sullivan and Sterling were made priſoners. The former has been per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, on his parole, to return for a little time. From my lord Sterling I had a letter by general Sullivan (a copy of which I have the honor to tranſmit) that contains his forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the engagement with his brigade. It is not ſo full and certain as I could wiſh:—he was hurried moſt probably, as his letter was unfiniſhed:—nor have I been yet able to obtain an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act account of our loſs:—We ſuppoſe it from ſeven hundred to a thouſand killed and taken.</p>
                  <p>General Sullivan ſays lord Howe is extremely deſirous of ſeeing ſome members of Congreſs; for which purpoſe he was allowed to come out, and to communicate to them what has paſſed between him and his lordſhip. I have conſented to his go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Philadelphia, as I do not mean, or conceive it right, to withhold, or prevent him from giving, ſuch information as he poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſes in this inſtance.</p>
                  <p>I am much hurried and engaged in arranging and making new diſpoſitions of our forces; the movements of the enemy requiring them to be immediately had;—and therefore have only time to add, that I am, with my beſt regards to Congreſs, their and your moſt obedient, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>AS my intelligence of late has been rather unfavorable, and would be received with anxiety and concern, peculiarly hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py ſhould I eſteem myſelf, were it in my power at this time to tranſmit ſuch information to Congreſs, as would be more pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:031423_0199_0FEC4795C3B6BEA0"/>
and agreeable to their wiſhes:—but, unfortunately for me,—unfortunately for them,—it is not.</p>
                  <p>Our ſituation is truly diſtreſſing. The check our detachment ſuſtained on the twenty-ſeventh ultimo has diſpirited too great a proportion of our troops, and filled their minds with appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion and deſpair. The militia, inſtead of calling forth their utmoſt efforts to a brave and manly oppoſition in order to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pair our loſſes, are diſmayed, intractable, and impatient to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn. Great numbers of them have gone off,—in ſome inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, almoſt by whole regiments, by half ones and by companies at a time. This circumſtance, of itſelf, independent of others, when fronted by a well appointed army ſuperior in number to our whole collected force, would be ſufficiently diſagreeable:—but, when their example has infected another part of the army, when their want of diſcipline, and refuſal of almoſt every kind of reſtraint and government, have produced a like conduct but too common to the whole, and an entire diſregard of that or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and ſubordination neceſſary to the well doing of an army, and which had been inculcated before, as well as the nature of our military eſtabliſhment would admit of,—our condition is ſtill more alarming: and with the deepeſt concern I am obliged to confeſs my want of confidence in the generality of the troops.</p>
                  <p>All theſe circumſtances fully confirm the opinion I ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained, and which I more than once in my letters took the liberty of mentioning to Congreſs, that no dependence could be put in a militia, or other troops than thoſe enliſted and embo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died for a longer period than our regulations heretofore pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed. I am perſuaded, and as fully convinced as I am of any one fact that has happened, that our liberties muſt of neceſſity be greatly hazarded if not entirely loſt, if their defence is left to any but a permanent ſtanding army,—I mean, one to exiſt during the war. Nor would the expenſe, incident to the ſupport of ſuch a body of troops as would be competent to almoſt every exigency, far exceed that which is daily incurred by calling in ſuccour, and new enliſtments, which, when effected, are not attended with any good conſequences. Men who have been free, and ſubject to no controul, cannot be reduced to order in an inſtant: and the privileges and exemptions, they claim and will have, influence the conduct of others: and the aid derived from them is nearly counterbalanced by the diſorder, irregularity, and confuſion they occaſion.</p>
                  <p>I cannot find that the bounty of ten dollars is likely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the deſired effect. When men can get double that ſum to
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:031423_0200_0FEC5AA3AF3F3700"/>
engage for a month or two in the militia, and that militia fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently called out, it is hardly to be expected.—The addition of land might have a conſiderable influence on a permanent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtment.</p>
                  <p>Our number of men at preſent fit for duty is under twenty thouſand; they were ſo by the laſt returns and beſt accounts I could get after the engagement on Long-Iſland; ſince which, numbers have deſerted. I have ordered general Mercer to ſend the men intended for the flying camp at this place, about a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand in number, and to try with the militia, if practicable, to make a diverſion on Staten-Iſland.</p>
                  <p>Till of late, I had no doubt in my own mind, of defending this place; nor ſhould I have yet, if the men would do their du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; but this I deſpair of. It is painful, and extremely grating to me, to give ſuch unfavorable accounts; but it would be criminal to conceal the truth at ſo critical a juncture. Every power I poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs ſhall be exerted to ſerve the cauſe; and my firſt wiſh is, that whatever may be the event, the Congreſs will do me the juſtice to think ſo.</p>
                  <p>If we ſhould be obliged to abandon the town, ought it to ſtand as winter quarters for the enemy? They would derive great incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences from it on the one hand; and much property would be deſtroyed on the other.—It is an important queſtion, but will ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of but little time for deliberation. At preſent I dare ſay the enemy mean to preſerve it if they can. If Congreſs therefore ſhould reſolve upon the deſtruction of it, the reſolution ſhould be a profound ſecret, as the knowledge of it will make a capital change in their plans.</p>

diſpatched major Crane of the artillery, with two twelve pounders and a howitzer, to annoy her; who, hulling her ſeveral times, forced her from that ſtation, and to take ſhelter behind an iſland, where ſhe ſtill continues.

                  <p>Judging it expedient to guard againſt every contingency as far as our peculiar ſituation will admit, and that we may have reſources left if obliged to abandon this place, I have ſent away and am re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving above Kingſbridge all our ſtores that are unneceſſary, and that will not be immediately wanted.</p>
                  <p>I have encloſed ſeveral original letters from ſome of our officers priſoners at Quebec, which fell into general Gate's hands, and were tranſmitted by him to general Schuyler who ſent them to me. General Gates adds, that the perſons who brought them ſaid general Burgoyne had ſent meſſages to the inhabitants upon the lakes, inviting their continuance on their farms and aſſuring them that they ſhould remain in ſecurity.</p>
                  <p>The poſt-maſter having removed his office from the city to Dobb's-ferry, as it is ſaid, makes it extremely inconvenient, and will be the means of my not giving ſuch conſtant and regular intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence as I could wiſh.—Cannot ſome mode be deviſed, by which we may have a pretty conſtant and certain intercourſe and commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication kept up? It is an enterpriſing matter, and of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance; and, as ſuch, I am perſuaded, will meet with due at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention from Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>I have tranſmitted the copy of general Gates's letter as ſent me by general Schuyler, from which Congreſs will diſcover all the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation I have reſpecting general Burgoyne's meſſage, and my lateſt intelligence from Tyconderoga, with the returns of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my there.—Thoſe of the army here it is impoſſible to obtain, till the hurry and buſtle we are now in are a little over.</p>

                  <p>I WAS laſt night honored with your favor of the third, with ſundry reſolutions of Congreſs: and perceiving it to be their opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion and determination that no damage ſhall be done the city in caſe we are obliged to abandon it, I ſhall take every meaſure in my power to prevent it.</p>
                  <p>Since my letter on the fourth, nothing very material has occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, unleſs it is that the fleet ſeem to be drawing more to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether and all getting cloſe in with Governor's-Iſland. Their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns we cannot learn; nor have we been able to procure the leaſt information of late, of any of their plans or intended opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>As the enemy's movements are very different from what we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected,—and from their large encampments a conſiderable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance up the Sound, there is reaſon to believe they intend to make a landing above or below Kingſbridge, and thereby to hem in our army, and to cut off the communication with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,—I mean to call a council of general officers to-day or to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, and endeavor to digeſt and fix upon ſome regular and certain ſyſtem of conduct to be purſued in order to baffle their efforts and counteract their ſchemes; and alſo to determine of the expediency of evacuating or attempting to maintain the city and the ſeveral poſts on this iſland. The reſult of their opinion and deliberations I ſhall adviſe Congreſs of by the earlieſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity, which will be by expreſs, having it not in my power to communicate any intelligence by poſt, as the office is removed to ſo great a diſtance, and entirely out of the way.</p>
                  <p>I have incloſed a liſt of the officers who are priſoners, and from whom letters have been received by a flag.—We know there are others not included in the liſt.</p>
                  <p>General Sullivan having informed me that general Howe was willing that an exchange of him for general Preſcot ſhould take place, it will be proper to ſend general Preſcot immediately, that it may be effected.</p>
                  <p>As the militia regiments in all probability will be impatient to return, and become preſſing for their pay, I ſhall be glad of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of Congreſs, whether they are to receive it here or from the conventions or aſſemblies of the reſpective ſtates to which they belong. On the one hand, the ſettlement of their ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtracts will be attended with trouble and difficulty: on the other, they will go away much better ſatisfied, and be more ready to give their aid in future, if they are paid before their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture.</p>

                     <pb n="204" facs="unknown:031423_0203_0FEC5AAD032E29C8"/>
Before I conclude, I muſt take the liberty of mentioning to Congreſs the great diſtreſs we are in for want of money. Two months pay (and more to ſome battalions) is now due the troops here, without any thing in the military cheſt to ſatisfy it. This occaſions much diſſatisfaction, and almoſt a general un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs. Not a day paſſes without complaints and the moſt importunate and urgent demands on this head.—As it may injure the ſervice greatly, and the want of a regular ſupply of caſh produce conſequences of the moſt fatal tendency, I en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat the attention of Congreſs to this ſubject, and that we may be provided as ſoon as can be, with a ſum equal to every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent claim.</p>
                  <p>I have wrote to general Howe, propoſing an exchange of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral M'Donald for lord Sterling, and ſhall be extremely hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py to obtain it, as well as that of general Sullivan for general Preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cot,—being greatly in want of them, and under the neceſſity of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing, protempore, ſome of the colonels to command bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades.</p>

                  <p>SINCE I had the honor of addreſſing you on the ſixth inſtant, I have called a council of the general officers, in order to take a full and comprehenſive view of our ſituation, and thereupon form ſuch a plan of future defence as may be immediately purſued, and ſubject to no other alteration than a change of operations on the enemy's ſide may occaſion.</p>
                  <p>Before the landing of the enemy on Long-Iſland, the point of attack could not be known, or any ſatisfactory judgment formed of their intentions. It might be on Long-Iſland, on Bergen, or directly on the city. This made it neceſſary to be prepared for each, and has occaſioned an expenſe of labor which now ſeems uſeleſs, and is regretted by thoſe who form a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from after knowledge. But I truſt, men of diſernment will think differently, and ſee that by ſuch works and preparations we have not only delayed the operations of the campaign till it is too late to effect any capital incurſion into the country, but have drawn the enemy's forces to one point and obliged them to [<hi>diſcloſe</hi>] their plan, ſo as to enable us to form our defence on ſome certainty.</p>
                  <p>It is now extremely obvious from all intelligence,—from their movements, and every other circumſtance,—that having landed their whole army on Long-Iſland (except about four thouſand on Staten-Iſland), they mean to incloſe us on the iſland of New-York by taking poſt in our rear while the ſhipping effectually ſecure the front; and thus, either by cutting off our communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with the country, oblige us to fight them on their own terms, or ſurrender at diſcretion,—or by a brilliant ſtroke en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to cut this army in pieces, and ſecure the collection of arms and ſtores, which they well know we ſhall not be able ſoon to replace.</p>
                  <p>Having therefore their ſyſtem unfolded to us, it became an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant conſideration how it could be moſt ſucceſsfully oppoſed. On every ſide there is a choice of difficulties: and every mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure on our part (however painful the reflection is from experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence) to be formed with ſome apprehenſion that all our troops will not do their duty. In deliberating on this great queſtion, it was impoſſible to forget, that hiſtory, our own experience, the advice of our ableſt friends in Europe, the fears of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and even the declarations of Congreſs, demonſtrate, that on our ſide the war ſhould be defenſive—(it has ever been called a war of poſts);—that we ſhould on all occaſions avoid a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:031423_0205_0FEC5AB5A418B130"/>
action, nor put any thing to the riſk, unleſs compelled by a neceſſity into which we ought never to be drawn.</p>
                  <p>The arguments on which ſuch a ſyſtem was founded were deemed unanſwerable; and experience has given her ſanction. With theſe views and being fully perſuaded that it would be preſumption to draw out her young troops into open ground a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their ſuperiors both in number and diſcipline, I have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſpared the ſpade and pickaxe. I confeſs I have not found that readineſs to defend even ſtrong poſts at all hazards, which is neceſſary to derive the greateſt benefit from them. The ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor of making a brave defence does not ſeem to be a ſufficient ſtimulus when ſucceſs is very doubtful, and the falling into the enemy's hands probable: but I doubt not, this will be gradual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly attained.—We are now in a ſtrong poſt, but not an impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable one, nay, acknowledged by every man of judgment to be untenable, unleſs the enemy will make the attack upon lines when they can avoid it, and their movements indicate that they mean to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>To draw the whole army together in order to arrange the defence proportionate to the extent of lines and works, would leave the country open for an approach, and put the fate of this army and its ſtores on the hazard of making a ſucceſsful defence in the city, or the iſſue of an engagement out of it. On the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hand, to abandon a city which has been by ſome deemed defenſible, and on whoſe works much labor has been beſtowed, has a tendency to diſpirit the troops and enfeeble our cauſe. It has alſo been conſidered as the key to the northern country. But as to that, I am fully of opinion that the eſtabliſhing of ſtrong poſts at Mount-Waſhington on the upper part of this iſland, and on the Jerſey ſide oppoſite to it, with the aſſiſtance of the obſtruction already made (and which may be improved) in the water, not only the navigation of Hudſon's river, but an eaſier and better communication may be effectually ſecured between the northern and ſouthern ſtates. This, I believe, every one acquainted with the ſituation of the country will readily agree to: and it will appear evident to thoſe who have an opportunity of recurring to good maps.</p>
                  <p>Theſe and many other conſequences, which will be involved in the determination of our next meaſure, have given our minds full employ, and led every one to form a judgment as various objects preſented themſelves to his view.</p>
                  <p>The poſt at Kingſbridge is naturally ſtrong, and is pretty well fortified: the heights about it are commanding, and might ſoon be made more ſo. Theſe are important objects, and I have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:031423_0206_0FEC5AB8F26AB530"/>
to them accordingly. I have alſo removed from the city all the ſtore and ammunition except what was abſolutely neceſſary for its defence, and made every other diſpoſition that did not eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentially interfere with the object,—carefully keeping in view, until it ſhould be abſolutely determined on full conſideration, how far the city was to be defended at all events.</p>
                  <p>In reſolving points of ſuch importance, many circumſtances peculiar to our own army alſo occur. Being only provided for a ſummer's campaign, their clothes, ſhoes, and blankets, will ſoon be unfit for the change of weather which we every day feel. At preſent we have not tents for more than two-thirds, many of them old and worn out: but if we had a plentiful ſupply, the ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon will not admit of continuing in them long.—The caſe of our ſick is alſo worthy of much conſideration. Their number, by the returns, forms at leaſt one-fourth of the army. Policy and humanity require they ſhould be made as comfortable as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>With theſe, and many other circumſtances before them, the whole council of general officers met yeſterday in order to adopt ſome general line of conduct to be purſued at this important criſis. I intended to have procured their ſeparate opinions on each point; but time would not admit. I was therefore obliged to collect their ſenſe more generally than I could have wiſhed.—All agreed the town would not be tenable if the enemy reſolved to bombard and cannonade it; but the difficulty attending a removal operated ſo ſtrongly, that a courſe was taken between abandoning it totally and concentring our whole ſtrength for its defence: nor were ſome a little influenced in their opinions to whom the determination of Congreſs was known, againſt an evacuation totally, as they were led to ſuſpect Congreſs wiſhed it to be maintained at every hazard.</p>
                  <p>It was concluded to arrange the army under three diviſions;—five thouſand to remain for the defence of the city;—nine thouſand to Kingſbridge and its dependencies, as well to poſſeſs and ſecure thoſe poſts, as to be ready to attack the enemy who are moving eaſtward on Long-Iſland, if they ſhould attempt to land on this ſide;—the remainder to occupy the intermediate ſpace, and ſupport either;—that the ſick ſhould be immediately removed to Orange-town, and barracks prepared at Kingſbridge with all expedition to cover the troops.</p>
                  <p>There were ſome general officers, in whoſe judgment and opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion much confidence is to be repoſed, that were for a total and immediate removal from the city;—urging the great danger of one part of the army being cut off before the other can ſupport
<pb n="208" facs="unknown:031423_0207_0FEC5ABA8F379588"/>
it, the extremities being at leaſt ſixteen miles apart;—that our army, when collected, is inferior to the enemy;—that they can move with their whole force to any point of attack, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently muſt ſucceed by weight of numbers, if they have on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a part to oppoſe them;—that, by removing from hence, we deprive the enemy of the advantage of their ſhips, which will make at leaſt one half of the force to attack the town;—that we ſhould keep the enemy at bay, put nothing to the hazard, but at all events keep the army together, which may be recruited another year;—that the unſpent ſtores will alſo be preſerved; and, in this caſe, the heavy artillery can alſo be ſecured. But they were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruled by a majority, who thought for the preſent a part of our force might be kept here, and attempt to maintain the city a while longer.</p>
                  <p>I am ſenſible a retreating army is incircled with difficulties: that the declining an engagement ſubjects a general to reproach; and that the common cauſe may be affected by the diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it may throw over the minds of many. Nor am I inſenſible of the contrary effects, if a brilliant ſtroke could be made with any probability of ſucceſs, eſpecially after our loſs upon Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Iſland. But, when the fate of America may be at ſtake on the iſſue,—when the wiſdom of cooler moments and experienced men have decided that we ſhould protract the war, if poſſible,—I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not think it ſafe or wiſe to adopt a different ſyſtem when the ſeaſon for action draws ſo near a cloſe.</p>
                  <p>That the enemy mean to winter in New-York, there can be no doubt:—that, with ſuch an armament they can drive us out, is equally clear.—The Congreſs having reſolved that it ſhould not be deſtroyed, nothing ſeems to remain, but to determine the time of their taking poſſeſſion. It is our intereſt and wiſh to prolong it as much as poſſible, provided the delay does not affect our future meaſures.</p>
                  <p>The militia of Connecticut is reduced, from ſix thouſand, to leſs than two thouſand, and in a few days will be merely nominal. The arrival of ſome Maryland troops, &amp;c. from the flying camp, has in a great degree ſupplied the loſs of men: but the ammunition they have carried away will be a loſs ſenſibly felt. The impulſe for going home was ſo irreſiſtible, it anſwered no purpoſe to oppoſe it. Though I would not diſcharge, I have been obliged to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce; and it affords me more melancholy proof, how deluſive ſuch dependencies are.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed I have the honor to tranſmit a general return, the firſt I have been able to procure for ſome time; alſo a report of captain Newell from our works at Horn's hook or Hell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:031423_0208_0FEC5AE2E49A2DA0"/>
Their ſituation is extremely low, and the Sound ſo very narrow, that the enemy have them much within their command.</p>

                  <p>I WAS yeſterday honored with your favor of the eighth inſtant, accompanied by ſeveral reſolutions of Congreſs, to which I ſhall pay the ſtricteſt attention, and, in the inſtances required, make them the future rule of my conduct.</p>
                  <p>The mode of negociation purſued by lord Howe I did not approve of: but as general Sullivan was ſent out upon the bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, and with a meſſage to Congreſs, I could not conceive myſelf at liberty to interfere in the matter, as he was in the character of a priſoner, and totally ſubject to their power and direction.</p>
                  <p>The liſt of priſoners, before omitted through hurry, is now incloſed; though it will probably have reached Congreſs before this.—I ſhall write by the firſt opportunity for major Hawſakſe to repair to Philadelphia—(he is in the northern army);—and will alſo mention the ſeveral appointments in conſequence of colonel St. Clair's promotion.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as generals Preſcot and M'Donald arrive, I ſhall take meaſures to adviſe general Howe of it, that the propoſed ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for general Sullivan and lord Sterling may be carried into execution.</p>
                  <p>Since my letter of the eighth, nothing material has occurred, except that the enemy have poſſeſſed themſelves of Monte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zore's-Iſland, and landed a conſiderable number of troops upon it. This iſland lies in the mouth of Hearlem-river, which runs out of the Sound into the North-river, and will give the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my an eaſy opportunity of landing either on the low grounds of Morriſania, if their views are to ſeize and poſſeſs the paſſes above Kingſbridge, or on the plains of Haerlem, if they deſign to intercept and cut off the communication between our ſeveral poſts. I am making every diſpoſition and arrangement that the divided ſtate of our troops will admit of, and which appear moſt likely and the beſt calculated to oppoſe their attacks; for I preſume there will be ſeveral.—How the event will be, God only knows; but you may be aſſured that nothing in my power,

                  <p>By my letter of the eighth you would perceive that ſeveral of the council were for holding the town, conceiving it practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable for ſome time. Many of them now, upon ſeeing our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſtate, have altered their opinion, and allow the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency and neceſſity of concentring our whole force, or draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it more together. Convinced of the propriety of this mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, I am ordering our ſtores away, except ſuch as may be abſolutely neceſſary to keep as long as our troops remain; that, if an evacuation of the city becomes inevitable (which certainly muſt be the caſe), there may be as little to remove as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>The incloſed packet contains ſeveral letters for particular mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Congreſs and for ſome gentlemen in Philadelphia. They came to hand yeſterday, and were brought from France by a captain Levez lately arrived at Bedford in the Maſſachuſetts ſtate. I muſt requeſt the favor of you to open the packet, and to have the letters put in a proper channel of conveyance to the gentlemen they are addreſſed to.</p>

                  <p>Laſt evening the enemy tranſported a number of men from Buchanan's to Montezore's iſland, and by their ſeveral move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, more ſtrongly indicate their intention to land ſomewhere about Haerlem or Morriſania,—moſt likely, at both at the ſame time. This morning one of the ſhips that have been for ſome time in the Sound moved down towards Hell-gate; but, the tide leaving her, ſhe could not get near enough to bring her guns to bear upon our fortification. If ſhe means to attack it, it is probable ſhe will warp in the next tide. Their batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries have kept up a pretty conſtant fire againſt ours at that place, but without any conſiderable effect. This morning they opened a new one.</p>
                  <p>I do not recollect any other material occurrence, and ſhall only add, that I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE been duly honored with your favor of the tenth, with the reſolution of Congreſs which accompanied it, and thank them for the confidence they repoſe in my judgment re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting the evacuation of the city. I could wiſh to maintain it, becauſe I know it to be of importance; but I am fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that it cannot be done, and that an attempt for that purpoſe, if perſevered in, might and moſt certainly would be attended with conſequences the moſt fatal and alarming in their nature.</p>
                  <p>Senſible of this, ſeveral of the general officers, ſince the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination of the council mentioned in my laſt, petitioned that a ſecond council might be called to reconſider the propoſitions which had been before them upon the ſubject. Accordingly I called one on the twelfth, when a large majority not only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined a removal of the army prudent, but abſolutely neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,—declaring they were entirely convinced from a full and minute enquiry into our ſituation, that it was extremely peril<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous; and, from every movement of the enemy, and the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence received, their plan of operations was to get in our rear, and, by cutting off the communication with the main, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lige us to force a paſſage through them on the terms they wiſh, or to become priſoners in ſome ſhort time for want of neceſſary ſupplies of proviſion.</p>
                  <p>We are now taking every method in our power to remove the ſtores, &amp;c. in which we find almoſt inſuperable difficulties. They are ſo great and ſo numerous, that I fear we ſhall not ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect the whole before we meet with ſome interruption.—I fully expected that an attack ſomewhere would have been made laſt night. In that I was diſappointed; and happy ſhall I be, if my apprehenſions of one to-night, or in a day or two, are not confirmed by the event. If it is deferred a little while longer, I flatter myſelf all will be got away, and our force be more concentred, and of courſe more likely to reſiſt them with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.</p>
                  <p>Yeſterday afternoon, four ſhips of war, two of forty and two of twenty-eight guns went up the Eaſt-river, paſſing between Governor's and Long-Iſland, and anchored about a mile above the city, oppoſite Mr. Srivanſent's, where the Roſe man-of-war was lying before. The deſign of their going not being certainly known, gives riſe to various conjectures,—ſome ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing they are to cover the landing of a party of the enemy a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the city,—others that they are to aſſiſt in deſtroying our
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:031423_0211_0FEC5AC89291E800"/>
battery at Horn's-hook, that they may have a free and un-in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted navigation in the Sound. It is an object of great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to them, and what they are induſtriouſly trying to ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect by a pretry conſtant cannonade and bombardment.</p>
                  <p>Before I conclude, I would beg leave to mention to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, that the pay now allowed to nurſes for their attendance on the ſick is by no means adequate to their ſervices; the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of which is, that they are extremely difficult to procure; in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap>ed they are not to be got; and we are under the neceſſity of ſubſtituting in their place a number of men from the reſpective regiments, whoſe ſervice by that means is entirely loſt in the proper line of their duty, and but little benefit rendered to the ſick. The officers I have talked with upon the ſubject all agree that they ſhould be allowed a dollar per week, and that for leſs they cannot be had.</p>
                  <p>Our ſick are extremely numerous, and we find their removal attended with the greateſt difficulty. It is a matter that em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys much of our time and care; and what makes it more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing is the want of proper and convenient places for their reception.—I fear their ſufferings will be great and many. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, nothing on my part, that humanity or policy can require, ſhall be wanting to make them comfortable, ſo far as the ſtate of things will admit of.</p>

                  <p>ON ſaturday, about ſunſet, ſix more of the enemy's ſhips, one or two of which were men-of-war paſſed between Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor's-Iſland and Red-hook, and went up the Eaſt-river to the ſtation taken by thoſe mentioned in my laſt. In half an hour I received two expreſſes,—one from colonel Serjeant at Horn'ſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hook [Hell-gate] giving an account that the enemy, to the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount of three or four thouſand, had marched to the river, and were embarking for Barns's or Montezore's-iſland, where num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of them were then encamped:—the other from general Miſſlin, that uncommon and formidable movements were diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered among the enemy; which being confirmed by the ſcouts I had ſent out, I proceeded to Haerlem, where it was ſuppoſed (or at Morriſania oppoſite to it) the principal attempt to land would be made. However, nothing remarkable happened that
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:031423_0212_0FEC5ACE16A21140"/>
night: but in the morning they began their operations. Three ſhips of war came up the North-river as high as Bloomingdale, which put a total ſtop to the removal, by water, of any more of our proviſion, &amp;c. and about eleven o'clock thoſe in the Eaſt-river began a moſt ſevere and heavy cannonade, to ſcour the grounds, and cover the landing of their troops between Turtle-bay and the city, where breaſt works had been thrown up to oppoſe them.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as I heard the ſiring, I rode with all poſſible diſpatch towards the place of landing, when, to my great ſurpriſe and mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification, I found the troops that had been poſted in the lines retreating with the utmoſt precipitation, and thoſe ordered to ſupport them (Parſons and Fellows's brigades) flying in every direction, and in the greateſt confuſion, notwithſtanding the exertions of the generals to form them. I uſed every means in my power to rally and get them into ſome order: but my at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts were fruitleſs and ineffectual; and on the appearance of a ſmall party of the enemy, not more than ſixty or ſeventy, their diſorder increaſed, and they ran away in the greateſt confuſion, without firing a ſingle ſhot.</p>
                  <p>Finding that no confidence was to be placed in theſe brigades, and apprehending that another party of the enemy might paſs over to Haerlem plains and cut off the retreat to this place, I ſent orders to ſecure the heights in the beſt manner with the troops that were ſtationed on and near them; which being done, the retreat was effected with but little or no loſs of men, though of a conſiderable part of our baggage,—occaſioned by this diſgraceful and daſtardly conduct, Moſt of our heavy cannon, and a part of our ſtores and proviſions which we were about removing, was unavoidably left in the city, though every means (after it had been determined in council to evacuate the poſt) had been uſed to prevent it.</p>
                  <p>We are now encamped with the main body of the army on the heights of Haerlem, where I ſhould hope the enemy would meet with a defeat in caſe of an attack, if the generality of our troops would behave with tolerable bravery. But experience, to my extreme affliction, has convinced me that this is rather to be wiſhed for than expected. However, I truſt that there are many who will act like men, and ſhew themſelves worthy of the bleſſings of freedom.</p>
                  <p>I have ſent out ſome reconnoitring parties to gain intelligence, if poſſible, of the diſpoſition of the enemy, and ſhall inform Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of every material event by the earlieſt opportunity.—I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>AS my letter of the ſixteenth contained intelligence of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant nature, and ſuch as might lead Congreſs to expect that the evacuation of New-York and retreat to the heights of Haer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, in the manner they were made, would be ſucceeded by ſome other intereſting event, I beg leave to inform them that as yet nothing has been attempted upon a large and general plan of attack.</p>
                  <p>About the time of the poſt's departure with my letter, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my appeared in ſeveral large bodies upon the plains about two and a half miles from hence. I rode down to our advanced poſts, to put matters in a proper ſituation if they ſhould attempt to come on, When I arrived there I heard a firing, which, I was informed, was between a party of our rangers under the command of lieutenant-colonel Knolton, and an advanced party of the enemy. Our men came in and told me that the body of the enemy, who kept themſelves concealed, conſiſted of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout three hundred as near as they could gueſs, I immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ordered three companies of colonels Weedon's regiment from Virginia, under the command of major Leitch, and colonel Knol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton with his rangers compoſed of volunteers from different New-England regiments, to try to get in their rear, while a diſpoſition was making as if to attack them in front, and thereby draw their whole attention that way.</p>
                  <p>This took effect as I wiſhed on the part of the enemy. On the appearance of our party in front, they immediately ran down the hill, took poſſeſſion of ſome fences and buſhes, and a ſmart firing began, but at too great a diſtance to do much execution on either ſide. The parties under colonel Knolton and major Leitch unluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kily began their attack too ſoon, as it was rather in flank than in rear.—In a little time major Leitch was brought off wounded, having received three balls through his ſide; and, in a ſhort time after, colonel Knolton got a wound which proved mortal. Their men, however, perſevered, and continued the engagement with the greateſt reſolution.</p>
                  <p>Finding that they wanted a ſupport, I advanced part of colonel Griffith's and colonel Richardſons's Maryland regiments, with ſome detachments from the eaſtern regiments who were near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the place of action. Theſe troops charged the enemy with great intrepidity, and drove them from the wood into the plain, and were puſhing them from thence (having ſilenced
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:031423_0214_0FEC5AD2D0E804A8"/>
their fire in a great meaſure) when I judged it prndent to order a retreat, fearing the enemy (as I have ſince found was really the caſe) were ſending a large body to ſupport their party.</p>
                  <p>Major Leitch, I am in hopes, will recover: but colonel Knol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton's fall is much to be regretted, as that of a brave and good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer.—We had about forty wounded: the number of ſlain is not yet aſcertained: but it is very inconſiderable.</p>
                  <p>By a ſerjeant who deſerted from the enemy and came in this morning, I find that their party was greater than I imagined. It conſiſted of the ſecond battalion of light infantry, a battalion of the Royal Highlanders, and three companies of Heſſian ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flemen, under the command of brigadier-general Leſlie. The deſerter reports that their loſs in wounded and miſſing was eighty-nine, and eight killed. In the latter, his account is too ſmall, as our people diſcovered and buried double that number. This affair, I am in hopes, will be attended with many ſalutary conſequences, as it ſeems to have greatly inſpired the whole of our troops.—The ſerjeant further adds that a conſiderable body of men are now encamped from the Eaſt to the North river, between the ſeven and eight mile ſtones, under the command of general Clinton.—General Howe, he believes, has his quarters at Mr. Apthorp's houſe.</p>

However, it is probable in a little time the enemy will attempt to force us from hence, as we are informed they are bringing many of their heavy cannon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the the heights and the works we have thrown up.

                  <p>I HAVE been honored with your favor of the ſixteenth with its incloſures.—To prevent the injury and abuſes which would ariſe from the militia and other troops carrying away ammunition and continental property, I have publiſhed the ſubſtance of the reſolves upon the ſubject in general orders.</p>
                  <p>Since my letter of yeſterday, nothing of importance has caſt up. The enemy are forming a large and extenſive encampment in the plains mentioned in my laſt, and are buſily employed in tranſport<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their cannon and ſtores from Long-Iſland. As they advance them this way, we may reaſonably expect their operations will not long be deferred.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed are ſundry letters, &amp;c. to which Congreſs will be pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to pay ſuch regard as they may think them deſerving of. The letter from monſieur . . . . . came open under cover of one to me.—Thoſe from colonel Hand and colonel Ward con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a liſt of vacancies in their regiments, and of the perſons they eſteem proper to fill them. The former, I believe, returned no liſt before: the latter ſays he never got any commiſſions.—Generals Howe and Erſkine's proclamation ſhew the meaſures that have been purſued, to force and ſeduce the inhabitants of Long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Iſland from their allegiance to the ſtates, and to aſſiſt in their deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truction.</p>
                  <p>As the period will ſoon arrive, when the troops compoſing the preſent army (a few excepted) will be diſbanded according to the tenor of their enliſtments, and the moſt fatal conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces may cauſe if a ſuitable and timely proviſion is not made in this inſtance, I take the liberty of ſuggeſting to Congreſs not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the expediency but the abſolute neceſſity there is that their earlieſt attention ſhould be had to this ſubject. In reſpect to the time that troops ſhould be engaged for, I have frequently given my ſentiments; nor have I omitted to expreſs my opinion of the difficulties that will attend raiſing them, nor of the
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:031423_0216_0FEC5ADD311EA178"/>
impracticability of effecting it without the allowance of a large and extraordinary bounty.</p>
                  <p>It is a melancholy and painful conſideration to thoſe who are concerned in the work and have the command, to be forming ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies conſtantly, and to be left by troops juſt when they begin to deſerve the name, or perhaps at a moment when an impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant blow is expected. This, I am informed, will be the caſe at Tyconderoga, with part of the troops there, unleſs ſome ſyſtem is immediately come into, by which they can be induced to ſtay. General Schuyler tells me in a letter received yeſterday, that De Haas's, Maxwell's, and Wind's Regiments ſtand en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged only till the beginning of next month, and that the men, he is fearful, will not remain longer than the time of their enliſtments.</p>
                  <p>I would alſo beg leave to mention to Congreſs, that the ſeaſon is faſt approaching when clothes of every kind will be wanted for the army. Their diſtreſs is already great, and will be increaſed as the weather becomes more ſevere. Our ſituation is now bad, but it is much better than that of the militia that are coming to join us from the ſtates of the Maſſachuſetts-Bay and Connecticut, in conſequence of the requiſition of Congreſs. They, I am informed, have not a ſingle tent, or a neceſſary of any kind; nor can I conceive how it will be poſſible to ſupport them. Theſe circumſtances are extremely alarming, and oblige me to wiſh Congreſs to have all the tents, cloathing of ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery kind, and camp neceſſaries, provided and forwarded, that are to be procured. Theſe eaſtern reinforcements have not a ſingle neceſſary, not a pan or a kettle,—in which we are now greatly deficient.—It is with reluctance that I trouble Congreſs with theſe matters: but to whom can I reſort for relief unleſs to them? The neceſſity therefore, which urges the application, will excuſe it, I am perſuaded.</p>
                  <p>I have not been able to tranſmit Congreſs a general return of the army this week, owing to the peculiar ſituation of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs, and the great ſhifting and changing among the troops. As ſoon as I can procure one, a copy ſhall be forwarded to Congreſs.</p>

                  <p>FROM the hours alloted to ſleep I will borrow a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to convey my thoughts on ſundry important matters to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. I ſhall offer them with the ſincerity which ought to cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racterize a man of candor, and with the freedom which may be uſed in giving uſeful information without incurring the imputation of preſumption.</p>
                  <p>We are now, as it were, upon the eve of another diſſolution of our army. The remembrance of the difficulties which happened upon the occaſion laſt year,—the conſequences which might have followed the change if proper advantages had been ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken by the enemy,—added to a knowledge of the preſent temper and ſituation of the troops,—reflect but a very gloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my proſpect upon the appearances of things now, and ſatisfy me beyond the poſſibility of doubt, that, unleſs ſome ſpeedy and ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual meaſures are adopted by Congreſs, our cauſe will be loſt.</p>
                  <p>It is in vain to expect that any or more than a trifling part of this army will again engage in the ſervice on the encouragement offered by Congreſs. When men find that their townſmen and companions are receiving twenty, thirty, and more dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, for a few months' ſervice (which is truly the caſe), it cannot be expected, without uſing compulſion: and to force them into the ſervice would anſwer no valuable purpoſe. When men are irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the paſſions inflamed, they fly haſtily and cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to arms: but after the firſt emotions are over * * *, a ſoldier, reaſoned with upon the goodneſs of the cauſe he is engaged in and the ineſtimable rights he is contending for, hears you with patience, and acknowledges the truth of your obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but adds that it is of no more importance to him than others. The officer makes you the ſame reply, with this further remark, that his pay will not ſupport him, and he cannot ruin himſelf and family to ſerve his country, when every member of the community is equally intereſted, and benefitted by his la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors. * * *</p>
                  <p>It becomes evidently clear then, that, as this conteſt is not likely to be the work of a day, as the war muſt be carried on ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tematically,—and to do it you muſt have good officers,—there are, in my judgment, no other poſſible means to obtain them but by eſtabliſhing your army upon a permanent footing, and giving your officers good pay. This will induce gentlemen and
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:031423_0219_0FEC5AE8180B2E90"/>
men of character to engage: and till the bulk of your officers are compoſed of ſuch perſons as are actuated by principles of honor and a ſpirit of enterpriſe, you have little to expect from them. They ought to have ſuch allowances as will enable them to live like and ſupport the character of gentleman. * * * Beſides ſomething is due to a man who puts his life in [<hi>your</hi>] hands, hazards his health, and forſakes the ſweets of do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic enjoyment.—Why a captain in the continental ſervice ſhould receive no more than five ſhillings currency per day for per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the ſame duties that an officer of the ſame rank in the Britiſh ſervice receives ten ſhillings ſterling for, I never could conceive, eſpecially when the latter is provided with every neceſſary he requires upon the beſt terms, and the former can ſcarce procure them at any rate. There is nothing that gives a man conſequence and renders him fit for command, like a ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port that renders him independent of every body but the ſtate he ſerves.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the men, nothing but a good bounty can obtain them upon a permanent eſtabliſhment: and for no ſhorter time than the continuance of the war, ought they to be engaged; as facts inconteſtibly prove that the difficulty and coſt of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſtments increaſe with time.—When the army was firſt raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Cambridge, I am perſuaded the men might have been got, without a bounty for the war. After this, they began to ſee that the conteſt was not likely to end ſo ſpeedily as was imagined, and to feel their conſequence by remarking, that, to get in the mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia in the courſe of the laſt year, many towns were induced to give them a bounty.</p>
                  <p>Foreſeeing the evils reſulting from this, and the deſtructive conſequences which unavoidably would follow ſhort enliſtments, I took the liberty in a long letter (date not now recollected, as my letter-book is not here) to recommend the enliſtments for and during the war, aſſigning ſuch reaſons for it as experience has ſince convinced me were well founded. At that time, twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty dollars would, I am perſuaded, have engaged the men for this term. But it would not do to look back: and, if the preſent opportunity is ſlipped, I am perſuaded that twelve months more will increaſe our difficulties four-fold. I ſhall therefore take the freedom of giving it as my opinion, that a good bounty be immediately offered, aided by the proffer of at leaſt a hundred or a hundred and fifty acres of land, and a ſuit of clothes and blanket to each non-commiſſioned officer and ſoldier; as I have good athority for ſaying, that, however high the men's pay may appear, it is barely ſufficient, in the preſent ſcarcity and
<pb n="221" facs="unknown:031423_0220_0FEC5AEA4CF5DF00"/>
dearneſs of all kinds of goods, to keep them in clothes, much leſs afford ſupport to their families.</p>
                  <p>If this encouragement then is given to the men, and ſuch pay allowed the officers as will induce gentlemen of character and liberal ſentiments to engage, and proper care and precaution uſed in the nomination (having more regard to the characters of perſons than the number of men they can enliſt), we ſhould in a little time have an army able to cope with any that can be oppoſed to it, as there are excellent materials to form one out of. But while the only merit an officer poſſeſſes is his ability to raiſe men, while thoſe men conſider and treat him as an equal, (and in the character of an officer) regard him no more than a broom-ſtick, being mixed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether as one common herd,—no order nor diſcipline can prevail; nor will the officer ever meet with that reſpect which is eſſentially neceſſary to due ſubordination.</p>
                  <p>To place any dependence upon a militia is aſſuredly reſting up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a broken ſtaff,—men juſt dragged from the tender ſcenes of domeſtic life,—unaccuſtomed to the din of arms,—totally un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acquainted with every kind of military ſkill; which being followed by a want of confidence in themſelves, when oppoſed to troops regularly trained, diſciplined, and appointed, ſuperior in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and ſuperior in arms, makes them timid and ready to fly from their own ſhadows. Beſides, the ſudden change in their manner of living (particularly in the lodging) brings on ſickneſs in many, impatience in all, and ſuch an unconquerable deſire of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turning to their reſpective homes, that it not only produces ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and ſcandalous deſertions among themſelves, but infuſes the like ſpirit into others.</p>
                  <p>Again, men accuſtomed to unbounded freedom and no control, cannot brook the reſtraint which is indiſpenſably neceſſary to the good order and government of an army; without which, licentiouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and every kind of diſorder triumphantly reign.—To bring men to a proper degree of ſubordination is not the work of a day, a month, or even a year: and, unhappily for us and the cauſe we are engaged in, the little diſcipline I have been laboring to eſtabliſh in the army under my immediate command is in a manner done away by having ſuch a mixture of troops as have been called toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther within theſe few months.</p>
                  <p>Relaxed and unfit as our rules and regulations of war are for the government of an army, the militia (thoſe properly ſo cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; for of theſe we have two ſorts, the ſix-months-men and thoſe ſent in as a temporary aid) do not think themſelves ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to them, and therefore take liberties which the ſoldier is puniſhed for. This creates jealouſy: jealouſy begets diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction;
<pb n="222" facs="unknown:031423_0221_0FEC5AEFC4FFA9C0"/>
and theſe by degrees ripen into mutiny, keeping the whole army in a confuſed and diſordered ſtate,—rendering the time of thoſe who wiſh to ſee regularity and good order prevail, more unhappy than words can deſcribe. Beſides this, ſuch re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated changes take place, that all arrangement is ſet at nought, and the conſtant fluctuation of things deranges every plan as faſt as adopted.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, ſir, Congreſs may be aſſured, are but a ſmall part of the inconveniencies which might be enumerated, and attributed to militia: but there is one that merits particular attention, and that is the expenſe. Certain I am, that it would be cheaper to keep fifty or a hundred thouſand in conſtant pay, than to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon half the number and ſupply the other half occaſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally by militia. The time the latter are in pay before and after they are in camp, aſſembling and marching—The waſte of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition, the conſumption of ſtores, which in ſpite of every re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution or requiſition of Congreſs, they muſt be furniſhed with, or ſent home,—added to other incidental expenſes conſequent upon their coming and conduct in camp,—ſurpaſſes all idea, and deſtroys every kind of regularity and economy which you could eſtabliſh among fixed and ſettled troops, and will, in my opinion prove (if the ſcheme is adhered to) the ruin of our cauſe.</p>
                  <p>The jealouſies of a ſtanding army, and the evils to be appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended from one, are remote, and, in my judgment, ſituated and circumſtanced as we are, not at all to be dreaded: but the conſequence of wanting one, according to my ideas formed from the preſent view of things, is certain and inevitable ruin. For, if I was called upon to declare upon oath, whether the militia have been moſt ſerviceable or hurtful upon the whole, I ſhould ſubſcribe to the latter. I do not mean by this, however, to arraign the conduct of Congreſs: in ſo doing I ſhall equally condemn my own meaſures, if I did not my judgment: but ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, which is the beſt criterion to work by, ſo fully, clear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and deciſively reprobates the practice of truſting to militia, that no man who regards order, regularity and economy, or who has any regard for his own honor, character, or peace of mind, will riſk them upon this iſſue. * * *</p>
                  <p>An army formed of good officers moves like clock-work; but there is no ſituation upon earth leſs enviable nor more diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than that perſon's who is at the head of troops who are regardleſs of order and diſcipline, and who are unprovided with almoſt every neceſſary. In a word the difficulties which have for ever ſurrounded me ſince I have been in the ſervice, and
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:031423_0222_0FEC5AF58E1D0598"/>
kept my mind conſtantly upon the ſtretch,—the wounds which my feelings (as an officer) have received by a thouſand things which have happened contrary to my expectation and wiſhes, * * *—added to a conſciouſneſs of my inability to govern an army compoſed of ſuch diſcordant parts, and under ſuch a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of intricate and perplexing circumſtances,—induce not only a belief, but a thorough conviction in my mind, that it will be impoſſible (unleſs there is a thorough change in our military ſyſtem) for me to conduct matters in ſuch a manner as to give ſatisfaction to the public, which is all the recompence I aim at, or even wiſhed for.</p>
                  <p>Before I conclude, I muſt apoligiſe for the liberties taken in this letter, and for the blots and ſcratchings therein, not having time to give it more correctly.—With truth I can add, that, with every ſentiment of reſpect and eſteem, I am yours and the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs's moſt obedient, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>HAVING wrote you fully on ſundry important ſubjects this morning, as you will perceive by the letter which accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panies this, I mean principally now to incloſe a copy of a letter received from general Howe on ſunday morning, with the liſts of the priſoners in his hands,—of thoſe in our poſſeſſion belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the army immediately under his command,—and of my anſwer, which were omitted to be put in the other. His letter will diſcover to congreſs his refuſal to exchange lord Sterling for Mr. M'Donald, conſidering the latter only as a major. They will pleaſe to determine how he is to be ranked in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>
                  <p>The number of priſoners according to theſe returns is great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er than what we expected. However, I am inclined to believe, that, among thoſe in the liſt from Long-Iſland, are ſeveral mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of general Woodhull's party, who were never arranged in this army.—As to thoſe taken on the fifteenth, they greatly exceed the number that I ſuppoſed fell into their hands in the retreat from the city. At the time that I tranſmitted an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of that affair, I had not obtained returns, and took the matter upon the officers' reports. They are difficult to get with certainty at any time.—In the ſkirmiſh of monday ſe'nnight, they could have taken but very few.</p>

                     <pb n="224" facs="unknown:031423_0223_0FEC5AF7206AFB10"/>
Before I conclude, I ſhall take occaſion to mention that thoſe returns made with ſuch preciſion, and the difficulty that will attend the propoſed exchange on account of the diſperſed and ſcattered ſtate of the priſoners in our hands, will clearly evince the neceſſity of appointing commiſſaries and proper perſons to ſuperintend and conduct in ſuch inſtances. This I took the liberty of urging more than once, as well on account of the propriety of the meaſure and the ſaving that would have reſulted from it, as that the priſoners might be treated with humanity, and have their wants particularly attended to.</p>
                  <p>I would alſo obſerve, (as I eſteem it my duty) that this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is in want of almoſt every neceſſary,—tents, camp kettles, blankets, and clothes of all kinds. But what is to be done with reſpect to the two laſt articles, I know not, as the term of enliſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment will be nearly expired by the time they can be provided. This may be exhibited as a further proof of the diſadvantages attending the levying of an army upon ſuch a footing as never to know how to keep them without injuring the public or incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moding the men.—I have directed the colonel or commanding officer of each corps to uſe his endeavors to procure ſuch clothing as is abſolutely neceſſary: but at the ſame time I confeſs, that I do not know how they are to be got.</p>

                  <p>BEING about to croſs the North river this morning in order to view the poſt oppoſite, and the grounds between that and Paulus Hook, I ſhall not add much more than that I have been honored with your favor of the twenty-fourth and its ſeveral in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures; and that ſince my letter of yeſterday, no important event has taken place.</p>
                  <p>As colonel Hugh Stephenſon, of the rifle regiment ordered lately to be raiſed, is dead, according to the information I have received, I would beg leave to recommend to the particular notice of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs captain Daniel Morgan juſt returned among the priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers from Canada, as a fit and proper perſon to ſucceed to the vacancy occaſioned by his death. Ths preſent field-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the regiment cannot claim any right in preference to him, becauſe he ranked above them, and as a captain, when he firſt entered the ſervice. His conduct as an officer, on the expedition with general Arnold laſt fall,—his intrepid beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior in the aſſault upon Quebec, when the brave Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery fell,—the inflexible attachment he profeſſed to our cauſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his impriſonment, and which he perſeveres in,—added to theſe, his reſidence in the place colonel Stephenſon came from, and his intereſt and influence in the ſame circle, and with ſuch men as are to compoſe ſuch a regiment,—all, in my opinion, entitle him to the favor of Congreſs, and lead me to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that in his promotion the ſtates will gain a good and valua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble officer for the ſort of troops he is particularly recommended to command.</p>

                  <p>I DO myſelf the honor of tranſmitting to you the incloſed letter from lieutenant-colonel Livingſton, with ſundry copies of general Delancey's orders, which diſcover the meaſures the enemy are purſuing on Long-Iſland for raiſing recruits and obtaining ſupplies of proviſions. In conſequence of the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence they contain, and authentic advices through other channels reſpecting theſe matters, I have ſent brigadier-general George Clinton to meet general Lincoln who has got as far as Fairfield with part of the troops lately ordered by the Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts aſſembly, to concert with him and others an expedition acroſs the Sound with thoſe troops, three companies under colonel Livingſton, and ſuch further aid as governor Trumbull can afford, in order to prevent if poſſible their effecting thoſe important ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and to aſſiſt the inhabiants in the removal of their ſtock, grain, &amp;c. or in deſtroying them, that the enemy may not derive any advantage or benefit from them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="227" facs="unknown:031423_0226_0FEC5B03B42BF118"/>
The recruiting ſcheme they are proſecuting with uncommon in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry; nor is it confined to Long-Iſland alone. Having juſt now received a letter from the committee of Weſt-Cheſter county, adviſing that there are ſeveral companies of men in that and Dutcheſs county preparing to go off and join the king's ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, I have given directions to our guard-boats and the centries at our works at Mount-Waſhington to keep a ſtrict look-out in caſe they attempt to come down the North-river; alſo to general Heath at Kingſbridge, that the utmoſt vigilance may be obſerved by the regiments and troops ſtationed above there and down tow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards the Eaſt-river, that they may intercept them, ſhould they take that rout with a view of croſſing to Long-Iſland.—I will uſe every precaution in my power, to prevent thoſe parricides from ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhing their deſigns; but I have but little hopes of ſucceſs, as it will be no difficult matter for them to procure a paſſage over ſome part or other of the Sound.</p>
                  <p>I have been applied to lately by colonel Weedon of Virginia, for permiſſion to recruit the deficiency of men in his regiment out of the troops compoſing the flying camp,—informing me at the ſame time that ſome of thoſe from Maryland had offered to engage. Colonel Hand of the rifle battalion made a ſimilar applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to-day. If the enliſtments could be made, they would have this good conſequence,—the ſecuring of ſo many in the ſervice. However, as the meaſure might occaſion ſome uneaſineſs in their own corps, and be conſidered as a hardſhip by the ſtates to which they belong, and the means of their furniſhing more than the quota exacted from them in the general arrangement, and would make it more difficult for them to complete their own levies, I did not conceive myſelf at liberty to author<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe it without ſubmitting the propriety of it to the conſideration of Congreſs, and obtaining their opinion whether it ſhould be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed or not.</p>
                  <p>I have incloſed a liſt of warrants granted from the ſecond to the thirteenth ultimo incluſive, the only return of that ſort that I have been able to make ſince the reſolution for that purpoſe,—owing to the unſettled ſtate of our affairs, and my having ſent my papers a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way. You will alſo receive ſundry letters, &amp;c. from general Schuyler, which came under cover to me, and which I have the honor of forwarding.</p>
                  <p>By a letter juſt received from the committee of ſafety of the ſtate of New-Hampſhire, I find a thouſand of their militia were about to march on the twenty-fourth ultimo to reinforce this army in conſequence of the requiſition of Congreſs. Previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to their march, general Ward writes me he was obliged
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:031423_0227_0FEC5B075134D4B8"/>
to furniſh them with five hundred pounds of powder, and a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand pounds of muſket-ball; and I have little reaſon to expect that they are better provided with other articles than they were with ammunition. In ſuch caſe they will only add to our preſent diſtreſs, which is already far too great, and become diſguſted with the ſervice, though the time they are engaged for is only till the firſt of December.—This will injure their enliſting for a long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er term if not wholly prevent it.</p>
                  <p>By three deſerters who came from the Galatea man-of-war a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout five days ago, we are informed that ſeveral tranſports had ſailed, before they left her, from England, as it was generally reported, in order to return with a ſupply of proviſions, of which they ſay there is a want.—General Mercer, in a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, informed me that general Thompſon ſaid he had heard they were going to diſmiſs about a hundred of the ſhips from the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice.—I am alſo adviſed by a letter from Mr. Derby at Boſton, of the twenty-ſixth ultimo, that, the day before, a tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port ſnow had been taken and ſent into Piſcataway by a privateer, in her paſſage from New-York to the Weſt-Indies. She ſail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with five more under the convoy of a man-of-war in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to bring from thence the troops that are there, to join general Howe.—They were all victualled for four months.—From this intelligence it would ſeem as if they did not appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend any thing to be meditated againſt them by the court of France.</p>

                     <hi>October</hi> 3.—I have nothing in particular to communicate reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting our ſituation, it being much the ſame as when I wrote laſt.—We had an alarm this morning a little before four o'clock, from ſome of our out-centries, who reported that a large body of the enemy was advancing towards our lines.—This put us in mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: however, it turned out entirely premature; or at leaſt we ſaw nothing of them.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>BEFORE I knew of the late reſolutions of Congreſs which you did me the honor to encloſe in your letter of the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-fourth, and before I was favored with the viſit of your committee, I took the liberty of giving you my ſentiments on ſeveral points which ſeemed to be of importance.—I have no doubt but that the committee will make ſuch report of the ſtate and condition of the army, as will induce Congreſs to believe
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:031423_0228_0FEC5B08E73260C8"/>
that nothing but the moſt vigorous exertions can put matters upon ſuch a footing as to give this continent a fair proſpect of ſucceſs. Give me leave to ſay, ſir—I ſay it with due defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and reſpect (and my knowledge of the facts, added to the importance of the cauſe, and the ſtake I hold in it, muſt juſtify the freedom,—that your affairs are in a more unpromiſing way than you ſeem to apprehend.</p>
                  <p>Your army, as I mentioned in my laſt, is on the eve of its political diſſolution. True it is, you have voted a larger one in lieu of it; but the ſeaſon is late; and there is a material dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between voting of battalions and raiſing of men. In the latter there are more difficulties than Congreſs are aware of; which makes it my duty (as I have been informed of the prevailing ſentiments of this army) to inform them, that, unleſs the pay of the officers, eſpecially that of the field officers is raiſed, the chief part of thoſe that are worth retaining will leave the ſervice at the expiration of the preſent term, as the ſoldiers will alſo, if ſome greater encourrgement is not offered them than twenty dollars and a hundred acres of land.</p>
                  <p>Nothing leſs, in my opinion, than a ſuit of clothes annually given to each non-commiſſioned officer and ſoldier, in addition to the pay and bounty, will avail; and I queſtion whether that will do, as the enemy (from the information of one John Maſh, who, with ſix others, was taken by our guards) are giving ten pounds bounty for recruits, and have got a battalion under major Rogers nearly completed upon Long-Iſland.</p>
                  <p>Nor will leſs pay, according to my judgment, than I have taken the liberty of mentioning in the incloſed eſtimate, retain ſuch officers as we could wiſh to have continued. The differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence per month in each battalion will amount to better than a hundred pounds. To this may be added the pay of the ſtaff<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>officers; for it is preſumable they will not require an augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: but, being few in number, the ſum will not be greatly increaſed by them, and conſequently is a matter of no great moment: but it is a matter of no ſmall importance to make the ſeveral officers deſirable. When the pay and eſtabliſhment of an officer once becomes objects of intereſted attention, the ſloth, negligence, and even diſobedience of orders, which at this time but too generally prevail, will be purged off. But while the ſervice is viewed with indifference,—while the officer conceives that he is rather conferring than receiving an obligation,—there will be a total relaxation of all order and diſcipline, and every thing will move heavily on, to the great detriment
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:031423_0229_0FEC5B0B152C9BC8"/>
of the ſervice, and inexpreſſible trouble and vexation of the general.</p>
                  <p>The critical ſituation of our affairs at this time will juſtify my ſaying that no time is to be loſt in making of fruitleſs ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periments. An unavailing trial of a month to get an army upon the terms propoſed may render it impracticable to do it at all, and prove fatal to our cauſe; as I am not ſure whether any rubs in the way of our enliſtments, or unfavorable turn in our affairs, may not prove the means of the enemy recruiting men faſter than we do. To this may be added the inextricable difficulty of forming one corps out of another, and arranging matters with any degree of order, in the face of an enemy who are watching for advantages.</p>
                  <p>At Cambridge, laſt year, where the officers, (and more than a ſufficiency of them) were all upon the ſpot, we found it a work of ſuch extreme difficulty to know their ſentiments (each having ſome terms to propoſe) that I deſpaired once of getting the arrangements completed: and I do ſuppoſe, that at leaſt a hundred alterations took place before matters were finally ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſted. What muſt it be then under the preſent regulation, where the officer is to negotiate this matter with the ſtate he comes from, diſtant perhaps, two or three hundred miles?—ſome of whom, without leave or licence from me, ſet out to make perſonal application, the moment the reſolve got to their hands. What kind of officers theſe are I leave Congreſs to judge.</p>
                  <p>If an officer of reputation (for none other ſhould be applied to) is aſked to ſtay, what anſwer can he give, but in the firſt place, that he does not know whether it is at his option to do ſo, no proviſion being made in the reſolution of Congreſs, even recommendatory of this meaſure; conſequently, that it reſts with the ſtate he comes from (ſurrounded perhaps with a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of applications, and influenced probably by local attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments) to determine whether he can be provided for or not? In the next place, if he is an officer of merit, and knows that the ſtate he comes from is to furniſh more battalions than it at preſent has in the ſervice, he will ſcarcely, after two years' faithful ſervices, think of continuing in the rank he now bears, when new creations are to be made, and men appointed to offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces (no wiſe ſuperior in merit, and ignorant perhaps, of ſervice) over his head. A committee, ſent to the army from each ſtate, may upon the ſpot fix things with a degree of propriety and certainty, and is the only method I can ſee of bringing matters to a deciſion with reſpect to the officers of the army.
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:031423_0230_0FEC5B10D6D74E28"/>
But what can be done in the mean while towards the arrang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the country, I know not. In the one caſe you run the hazard of looſing your officers; in the other, of encountering delay, unleſs ſome method could be deviſed of forwarding both at the ſame inſtant.</p>
                  <p>Upon the preſent plan, I plainly foreſee an intervention of time between the old and new army, which muſt be filled up with militia (if to be had), with whom no man who has any regard for his own reputation can undertake to be anſwerable for conſequences. I ſhall alſo be miſtaken in my conjectures, if we do not loſe the moſt valuable officers in this army, under the preſent mode of appointing them: conſequently, if we have an army at all, it will be compoſed of materials not only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely raw, but, (if uncommon pains are not taken) entirely unfit; and I ſee ſuch a diſtruſt and jealouſy of military power, that the commander-in-chief has not an opportunity, even by recommendation, to give the leaſt aſſurances of reward for the moſt eſſential ſervices. In a word, ſuch a cloud of perplexing circumſtances appear before me, without one flattering hope, that I am thoroughly convinced, unleſs the moſt vigorous and deciſive exertions are immediately adopted to remedy theſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils, that the certain and abſolute loſs of our liberties will be the inevitable conſequence; as one unhappy ſtroke will throw a powerful weight into the ſcale againſt us, enabling general Howe to recruit his army as faſt as we ſhall ours,—numbers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing diſpoſed [<hi>to join him</hi>], and many actually doing ſo already. Some of the moſt probable remedies, and ſuch as experience has brought to my more intimate knowlede, I have taken the liberty to point out: the reſt I beg leave to ſubmit to the conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>I aſk pardon for taking up ſo much of their time with my opinions. But I ſhould betray that truſt which they and my coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try have repoſed in me, were I to be ſilent upon a matter ſo extremely intereſting.</p>

                  <p>I WAS laſt night honored with your favor of the ſecond, with ſundry reſolutions of Congreſs. * * *</p>
                  <p>In reſpect to the exchange of priſoners, I fear it will be a work of great difficulty, owing to their diſperſed and ſcattered
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:031423_0231_0FEC5B1760491B30"/>
ſituation throughout the ſtates. In order to effect it, I have wrote to the eaſtern governments to have them collected, and to tranſmit me an account of their number, diſtinguiſhing the names and ranks of the field and commiſſioned officers, and the corps they belong to. I have alſo wrote to governor Livingſton of the Jerſeys upon the ſubject, and muſt take the liberty of requeſting congreſs to give directions that a ſimilar return may be made of thoſe in Pennſylva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia and Maryland, and for their being brought to Brunſwick, that they may be ready to be exchanged for an equal number of thoſe of the ſame rank.</p>
                  <p>I obſerve, by the reſolve of the twenty-ſixth ultimo, that the exchange is particularly directed to be made of the officers and ſoldiers taken on Long-Iſland. But ſhould not that follow the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of thoſe officers and men who have lately returned from Quebec, whoſe impriſonment has been much longer, and whoſe ſervice has not been leſs ſevere, and, in many inſtances, conducted with great intrepidity? I have had many applications ſince their arrival, by which they claim a kind of preference as far as their number and the circumſtance of their rank will allow, and which I thought it my duty to mention, that I may obtain ſome direction upon the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>You will obſerve by a paragraph of a letter received yeſterday from general Howe, a copy of which you have at length, that the non-performance of the agreement between captain Forſter and general Arnold, by which the latter ſtipulated for the return of an equal number of officers and priſoners in our hands for thoſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered him, is conſidered in an unfavorable light, and entirely imputed to me, as having the chief command of the armies of the ſtates, and a controling power over general Arnold.—The pointed manner in which Mr. Howe is pleaſed to expreſs himſelf could not perſonally effect me, ſuppoſing there had been no good grounds for the treaty not being ratified, having been nothing more than an inſtrument conveying to him the reſolutions formed upon the ſubject. * * *</p>
                  <p>However I would beg leave to obſerve, from the letters from the hoſtages,—from what has been reported by others re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting captain Forſter's having uſed his endeavors to reſtrain the ſavages from exerciſing their wonted barbarities, though in ſome inſtances they did,—his purchaſing ſome of the priſoners for a pretty conſiderable premium,—but, above all, from the delicate nature of ſuch treaties, and becauſe the non-obſervance of them muſt damp the ſpirits of the officers who make them, and add affliction to the misfortunes of thoſe whom neceſſity and the nature of the caſe force into captivity to give them a
<pb n="233" facs="unknown:031423_0232_0FEC5B1B9DE52320"/>
ſanction by a long and irkſome confinement,—for theſe reaſons and many more that will readily occur, I could wiſh Congreſs to reconſider the matter, and to carry it into execution.</p>
                  <p>I am ſenſible the wrong was originally in their employing ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vages, and that whatever cruelties were committed by them ſhould be eſteemed their own acts: yet perhaps, in point of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy, it may not be improper to overlook theſe infractions on their part, and to purſue that mode which will be the moſt likely to render the hardſhips incident to war moſt tolerable, and the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt benefits to the ſtate.</p>
                  <p>I have ventured to ſay thus much on the ſubject, from a regard to the ſervice, and becauſe ſuch gentlemen of the army as I have heard mention it, ſeem to wiſh the treaty had been ratified rather than diſallowed.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed is a liſt of vacancies in the third regiment of Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia troops, in part occaſioned by the death of major Leitch who died of his wounds on tueſday morning,—and of the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen who ſtand next in regimental order, and who are recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended to ſucceed to them.—You will obſerve that captain John Fitzgerald is ſaid to be appointed to the duty of major. This I have done in order, being the oldeſt captain in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, and, I believe, an officer of unexceptionable merit, and as it was highly neceſſary at this time to have the corps as well and fully officered as poſſible. There is alſo a vacancy in the firſt continental battalion, by the promotion of lieutenant Clarke to a majority in the flying camp, to which colonel Hand has recommended William Patton to ſucceed, as you will perceive by his letter incloſed.</p>
                  <p>I have taken the liberty to tranſmit a plan for eſtabliſhing a corps of engineers, artificers, &amp;c. ſketched out by colonel Putnam, and which is propoſed for the conſideration of Congreſs. How far they may incline to adopt it, or whether they may ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed upon ſuch an extenſive ſcale, they will be pleaſed to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. However, I conceive it a matter well worthy of their conſideration, being convinced from experience, and from the reaſons ſuggeſted by colonel Putnam who has acted with great diligence and reputation in the buſineſs, that ſome eſtabliſhment of the ſort is highly neceſſary, and will be productive of the moſt beneficial conſequences.</p>
                  <p>If the propoſition is approved by Congreſs, I am informed by good authority that there is a gentleman in Virginia, in the colony ſervice, John Stadler, eſquire, a native of Germany, whoſe abilities in this way are by no means inconſiderable. I am told he was an engineer in the army under general Stanwix,
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:031423_0233_0FEC5B1D30005C50"/>
and is reputed to be of ſkill and ingenuity in the profeſſion. In this capacity I do not know him myſelf, but am intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with him in his private character, as a man of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and of good behaviour. I would ſubmit his merit to the inquiry of Congreſs; and if he ſhould anſwer the report I have had of him, I make no doubt but he will be ſuitably provided for.</p>
                  <p>The convention of this ſtate have lately ſeized and had ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praiſed two new ſhips, valued at ſix thouſand two hundred and twenty-nine pounds York currency, which they have ſent down for the purpoſe of ſinking, and obſtructing the channel oppoſite Mount-Waſhington. The price being high, and the opinions various as to the neceſſity of the meaſure, ſome conceiving the obſtruction nearly ſufficient already, and others that they would render it ſecure, I would wiſh to have the direction of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs upon the ſubject by the earlieſt opportunity, thinking my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that, if the enemy ſhould attempt to come up, they ſhould be uſed, ſooner than to hazard their paſſing.—I muſt be governed by circumſtances, yet hope for their ſentiments before any thing is neceſſary to be done.</p>
                  <p>Sundry diſputes having ariſen of late between officers of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent regiments and of the ſame rank, reſpecting the right of ſucceſſion to ſuch vacancies as happen from death or other cauſes,—ſome ſuggeſtion that it ſhould be in a colonial line and governed by the priority of their commiſſions,—others, that it ſhould be regimentally,—and there being an inſtance now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore me, between the officers of the Virginia regiments, occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by the death of major Leitch,—it has become abſolutely neceſſary that Congreſs ſhould determine the mode by which promotions are to be regulated,—whether colonially and by priority of commiſſions, or regimentally, reſerving a right out of the general rule they adopt, to reward for particular merit, or of withholding from office ſuch as may not be worthy to ſucceed.</p>
                  <p>I have only propoſed two modes for their conſideration, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſatisfied that promotions through the line (as they are call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed) can never take place without producing diſcord, jealouſy, diſtruſt, and the moſt fatal conſequences. In ſome of my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters upon the ſubject of promotions, and one which I had the honor of addreſſing to the board of war on the thirtieth ultimo, I adviſed that the mode ſhould be rather practiſed than reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but I am fully convinced now of the neceſſity there is of ſettling it in one of the two ways I have taken the liberty to point out, and under the reſtrictions I have mentioned; or the

                  <p>I DO myſelf the honor of tranſmitting to you a copy of a letter from the comte D'Emery, governor-general of the French part of St. Domingo, which I received yeſterday, and alſo my anſwer, which I have encloſed and left open for the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Congreſs, wiſhing that it may be ſealed if they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the ſieur De Chambeau's releaſement, which I think may be attended with many valuable conſequences. If Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs concur in ſentiment with me, they will be pleaſed to give direction for his paſſage by the firſt opportunity to the French iſlands: if they do not, I ſhall be obliged by your returning my letter.</p>
                  <p>I have alſo the pleaſure of incloſing a copy of a letter from monſieur P. Pennel, which came to hand laſt night, and which contains intelligence of an agreeable and intereſting nature, for which I beg leave to refer you to the copy. The polite manner in which monſieur Pennel has requeſted to be one of my aids-de-camp demands my acknowledgments. As the appointment will not be attended with any expenſe, and will ſhew a proper regard for his complaiſance and the attachment he is pleaſed to expreſs for the ſervice of the American ſtates, I ſhall take the liberty of complying with his requiſition, and tranſmit him a brevet com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion, provided the fame ſhall be agreeable to Congreſs.—Their ſentiments upon this ſubject you will be kind enough to favor me with by the firſt opportunity. The incloſed letter for the ſieur De Chambeau you will pleaſe to forward to him (if he is to be enlarged) after cloſing it.</p>
                  <p>Before I conclude, I muſt take the liberty to obſerve that I am under no ſmall difficulties on account of the French gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men that are here in conſequence of the commiſſions they have received,—having no means to employ them, or to afford them an opportunity of rendering that ſervice they themſelves wiſh to give, or which perhaps is expected by the public. Their want of our language is an objection to their being joined to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the regiments here at this time, were there vacancies, and not other obſtacles. Theſe conſiderations induce me to
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:031423_0235_0FEC5B2272746D78"/>
wiſh that Congreſs would adopt and point out ſome particular mode to be obſerved reſpecting them. What it ſhould be, they will be beſt able to determine. But to me it appears that their being here now can be attended with no valuable conſequences, and that, as the power of appointing officers for the new army is veſted in the conventions, &amp;c. of the ſeveral ſtates, it will be neceſſary for Congreſs to direct them to be provided for in the regiments to be raiſed, according to the ranks they would wiſh them to bear—(or I am convinced they will never be ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken in, let their merit be what it may); or to form them into a diſtinct corps which may be increaſed in time. They ſeem to be genteel, ſenſible men; and I have no doubt of their mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing good officers as ſoon as they can learn as much of our lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage as to make themſelves well underſtood: but, unleſs Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs interfere by their particular direction to the ſtates, they will never be incorporated in any of the regiments to be raiſed; and, without they are, they will be entirely at a loſs, and in the moſt irkſome ſituation, for ſomething to do, as they now are.—I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>SINCE I had the honor of writing you yeſterday, I have been favored with a letter from the honorable council of Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſachuſetts-Bay, covering one from Richard Derby, eſquire, a copy of which is herewith tranſmitted, as it contains intelligence of an important and intereſting nature.</p>
                  <p>As an exchange of priſoners is about to take place, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced, from a queſtion ſtated in a letter I received from go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Trumbull this morning, to aſk the opinion of Congreſs in what manner the ſtates that have had the care of them are to be reimburſed the expenſes incurred on their account. My want of information in this inſtance, or whether any account is to be ſent in with the priſoners, would not allow me to give him an anſwer, as nothing that I recollect has ever been ſaid upon the ſubject.—He alſo mentions another matter, <abbr>viz.</abbr> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuch privates as are mechanics, and others who may deſire to remain with us, ſhould be obliged to return.—In reſpect to the latter, I conceive there can be no doubt of our being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a neceſſity of returning the whole, a propoſition having been made on our part for a general exchange, and that agreed to; beſides, the balance of priſoners is greatly againſt us; and
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:031423_0236_0FEC5B247A65C888"/>
I am informed it was particularly ſtipulated by general Montgo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mery, that all thoſe that were taken in Canada ſhould be exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed whenever a cartel was ſettled for the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>Under theſe circumſtances, I ſhould ſuppoſe the ſeveral commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees having the care of them ſhould be inſtructed to make the moſt exact returns of the whole, however willing a part ſhould be to continue with us. At the ſame time I ſhould think it not impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to inform them of the reaſons leading to the meaſure, and that they ſhould be invited to eſcape afterwards, which, in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, they may effect without much difficulty if they are attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to us, extending their influence to many more, and bringing them away alſo.</p>
                  <p>The ſituation of our affairs and the preſent eſtabliſhment of the army requiring our moſt vigorous exertions to engage a new one, I preſume it will be neceſſary to furniſh the paymaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-general as early as poſſible with money to pay the bounty, late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſolved on, to ſuch men as will enliſt. Prompt pay, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps may have a happy effect, and induce the continuance of ſome who are here: but, without it, I am certain that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be done; nor have we time to loſe in making the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riment. But then it may be aſked, who is to recruit? or who can conſider themſelves as officers for that purpoſe, till the conventions of the different ſtates have made the appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments?</p>
                  <p>Yeſterday afternoon the exchange between lord Sterling and governor Browne was carried into execution; and his lordſhip is now here. He confirms the intelligence mentioned by captain Souther, about the tranſports he met, by the arrival of the Daphne man-of-war (a twenty gun ſhip) a few days ago, with twelve ſhips under her convoy, having light-horſe on board. They ſailed with about twenty in each, and loſt about eighteen in their paſſage, beſides thoſe in the veſſel taken by cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain Souther.—He further adds that he had heard it acknowledged more than once, that, in the action of the ſixteenth ultimo, the enemy had a hundred men killed,—about ſixty Highlanders of the forty-ſecond regiment, and forty of the light infantry. This confeſſion coming from themſelves, we may reaſonably con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, did not exaggerate the number, * * *</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>October</hi> 9.—About eight o'clock this morning, two ſhips, of forty-four guns each (ſuppoſed to be the Roebuck and Phoenix), and a frigate of twenty guns, with three or four tenders, got under way from about Bloomingdale where they had been lying ſome time, and ſtood with an eaſy ſoutherly breeze to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:031423_0237_0FEC5B2AB8150A58"/>
our chevaux-de-friſe, which we hoped would have intercept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their paſſage while our batteries played upon them: but, to our ſurpriſe and mortification, they ran through without the leaſt difficulty, and without receiving any apparent damage from our forts, though they kept up a heavy fire from both ſides of the river. Their deſtination or views cannot be known with certainty: but moſt probably they are ſent to ſtop the navigation, and cut off the ſupplies of boards, &amp;c. which we ſhould have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, and of which we are in great need. They are ſtanding up, and I have diſpatched an expreſs to the convention of this ſtate, that notice may be immediately communicated to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Clinton at the Highland fortifications, to put him on his guard in caſe they ſhould have any deſigns againſt them, and that precautions ſhould be taken to prevent the craft belonging to the river falling into their hands.</p>

                  <p>I BEG leave to inform you, that, ſince my letter of the eighth and ninth inſtant which I had the honor of addreſſing you, nothing of importance has occurred, except of that the ſhips of war which I then mentioned, in their paſſage up the river, took a ſloop that was at anchor off the mouth of Spitendevil, and two of our row-gallies which they out-ſailed. The crews, finding that they could not prevent them falling into the enemy's hands, ran them near the ſhore and effected their own eſcape. From the intelligence I have received, the ſhips are now ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing at Tarrytown, without having landed any men (which ſeemed to be apprehended by ſome), or attempted any thing elſe. Their principal views in all probability are, to interrupt our navigation, and to receive ſuch diſaffected perſons as incline to take part againſt us. The former they will effect beyond all queſtion; and I fear that their expectations reſpecting the latter will be but too fully anſwered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>October</hi> 12.—The incloſed copy of a letter received laſt night from the convention of this ſtate will ſhew you the appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions they are under on account of the diſaffected among them.—I have ordered up a part of the militia from the Maſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chuſetts under general <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap>, to prevent, if poſſible, the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences which they ſuggeſt may happen, and which there is reaſon to believe the conſpirators have in contemplation. I am purſuaded that they are upon the eve of breaking out, and
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:031423_0238_0FEC5B2C483DF470"/>
that they will leave nothing un-eſſayed that will diſtreſs us and favor the deſigns of the enemy, as ſoon as their ſchemes are ripe for it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>October</hi> 13.—Yeſterday the enemy landed at Frog's-Point, about nine miles from hence, further up the ſound. Their number we cannot aſcertain, as they have not advanced from the point,—which is a kind of iſland,—but the water that ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounds it is favorable at low tide. I have ordered works to be thrown up at the paſſes from the point to the main. From the great number of ſloops, ſchooners, and nine ſhips, that went up the Sound in the evening, full of men, and from the informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of two deſerters who came over laſt night, I have reaſon to believe that the greateſt part of their army has moved upwards, or is about to do it, purſuing their original plan of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in our rear and cutting off our communication with the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try.</p>
                  <p>The grounds from Frog's-Point are ſtrong and defenſible, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing full of ſtone fences both along the road and acroſs the adjacent fields, which will render it difficult for artillery, or indeed a large body of foot, to advance in any regular order, except through the main road.—Our men who are poſted on the paſſes ſeemed to be in great ſpirits when I left them laſt night.</p>

Declining an attack up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on our front, they have drawn the main body of their ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my to Frog's-Point, with a deſign of hemming us in, and drawing a line in our rear. To prevent the conſequences which would but too probably follow the execution of their ſcheme, the general officers determined yeſterday that our forces muſt be taken from hence, and extended towards Eaſt and Weſt Cheſter, ſo as to out-flank them. General Lee, who arrived on monday, has ſtrongly urged the abſolute neceſſity of the meaſure. It is propoſed to leave a garriſon at Fort Waſhington, and to maintain it if poſſible, in order to preſerve the communication with the Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys.—They are landing their artillery and waggons upon the point; and there are now ſeveral boats paſſing up the Sound, full of men.</p>

                  <p>I WAS yeſterday morning honored with your favor of the fifteenth, with the reſolutions of the eleventh and fourteenth. The latter, by which Congreſs have authoriſed me to appoint monſieur Pennel a brevet aid-de-camp, claims a return of my ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgments.</p>
                  <p>Laſt night I received a letter from Mr. Varick, ſecretary to general Schuyler incloſing a copy of one from general Arnold to general Gates. The intelligence tranſmitted by general Arnold being of an extremely intereſting and important nature, I thought it adviſable to forward the ſame immediately by expreſs. You have a copy herewith, which contains the particulars, and to which I beg leave to refer you.</p>
                  <p>The accounts tranſmitted you yeſterday by poſt will inform you of the movements of the enemy, and of the meaſures judged ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be purſued by us, to counteract their deſigns. I have nothing to add on this head, except that ten or eleven ſhips, which have been prevented paſſing Hell-gate for two or three days for want of wind, are now under way, and proceeding up the Sound. Amongſt them there appear to be two frigates: the reſt probably have in ſtores, &amp;c.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed is a copy of the laſt general return I have been able to obtain. It only comes down to the fifth inſtant: the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our affairs, and the almoſt conſtant neceſſity of ſending de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments from one place to another to watch the enemy's mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, have prevented the officers from making them with regularity.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE it in command from his excellency to tranſmit you the incloſed copies of diſpatches which juſt now came to hand, and which contain intelligence of the moſt intereſting and important nature reſpecting our affairs in the northern department. His ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency would have wrote himſelf, but was going to our ſeveral poſts, when the expreſs arrived.</p>
                  <p>The enemy are purſuing with great induſtry their plan of pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating the country from the Sound, and of forming a line in our rear. They are now extended from Frog's-Point to New-Rochelle.
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:031423_0241_0FEF8BB3A32C8C10"/>
from whence it is generally conjectured they mean to take their route by way of the White-Plains, and from thence to draw a line to the North-river. We on our part have drawn our whole force, except the regiments intended to garriſon Fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Waſhington, from the iſland of New-York, and have poſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ourſelves of the heights, paſſes, and advantageous grounds be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween New-Rochelle, where the van of their army now lies, and the North-River.—They will in all probability attempt to effect their purpoſe by moving higher up. If they do, our forces wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> move accordingly, it being a principal object to prevent their out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flanking us.</p>
                  <p>On friday, one of their advanced parties, near Eaſt-Cheſter, fell in with part of colonel Glover's brigade, and a ſmart and cloſe ſkirmiſh enſued, in which, I have the pleaſure to inform you, our men behaved with great coolneſs and intrepidity, and drove the enemy back to their main body.</p>

As large quantities are conſtantly in demand in time of war, he does not conceive your proviſion in theſe inſtances can be too great.</p>
                  <p>He will direct the regimental returns in future to include arms and accoutrements, and the commiſſary-general to tranſmit month<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly liſts of rations.

                  <p>THE whole of our army is now here and on the neighbor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heights, except the troops left at Mount-Waſhington and Kingſbridge (about fourteen hundred at the former, and ſix hundred at the latter), and general Lee's diviſion which now forms the rear, and which is on their march. Our removal, and that of the ſtores, have been attended with a great deal of trouble, owing to the ſcarcity and difficulty of procuring waggons. However, they are nearly effected, and without any loſs.—The general officers are now reconnoitering the ſeveral paſſes lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from the enemy, that the moſt important may be immediately ſecured.—The ſituation of their army remains nearly the ſame as when I had the honor of addreſſing you on the twenty-firſt inſtant. It differs in nothing unleſs it is that their main body is more col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected about New-Rochelle. A few of their troops are extended as far as Momarioneck.</p>
                  <p>On monday night a detachment of our men, under the command of colonel Hazlet, was ſent out to ſurpriſe and cut off ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Rogers, if poſſible, with his regiment which was poſted there. By ſome accident or other the expedition did not ſucceed ſo well as I could have wiſhed. However, our advanced party, led on by major Greene of the firſt Virginia regiment, fell in with their out-guard, and brought off thirty-ſix priſoners, ſixty muſkets, and ſome blankets. The number killed is not certainly known: but it is reported by an officer who was there, that he counted about twenty-five.—Our loſs, two kill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:031423_0243_0FEF8BC7C8DE4768"/>
and ten or twelve wounded; among the latter, major Greene, whoſe recovery is very doubtful.</p>
                  <p>On wedneſday there was alſo a ſmart ſkirmiſh between a party of colonel Hands' riflemen,—about two hundred and forty,—and nearly the ſame number of Heſſian chaſſeurs, in which the latter were put to the rout. Our men buried ten of them on the field, and took two priſoners, one badly wounded. We ſuſtained no other loſs than having one lad wounded, ſuppoſed mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally.</p>
                  <p>The ſhips of war that are in the North-river, fell down yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning or the evening before, to Dobbs's ferry, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent our bringing ſtores from below by water, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of thoſe that are landed there. As ſoon as the waggons, employed in bringing the baggage and ſtores of general Lee's di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion, are diſengaged, they will be immediately ſent to aſſiſt thoſe already there to remove them.</p>
                  <p>On ſaturday night we had the misfortune to loſe one of the new ſhips intended to be ſunk for obſtructing the channel. She parted her cables in a ſevere ſquall, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>hen properly ballaſted, and bilged as ſoon as ſhe ſtruck the ſhore. The other ſhip was ſunk well; and yeſterday morning two brigs, both ready, were ſent down for the ſame purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>About two o'clock this afternoon, intelligence was brought to head-quarters that three or four detachments of the enemy were on their march, and had advanced within about four miles of this place. It has been fully confirmed ſince by a variety of perſons who have been out to reconnoitre.—Their number cannot be aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained: but it is generally conjectured that the detachments are or will be ſucceeded by as many columns compoſing their main body. Our drums have beat to arms, and the men are ordered to their ſeveral poſts.—Moſt probably ſome important event is upon the eve of taking place; I hope it will be victory in favor of our arms.—General Lee, with his diviſion, has not got up; but I hear he is on his march.</p>
                  <p>Experiment having proved it difficult, if not impoſſible, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent the enemy from poſſeſſing the navigation of the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>river, and to rendering the communication and intercourſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the ſtates divided by it extremely hazardous and preca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious by means of their ſhips of war, it has become a matter of important conſideration how to remedy the evil, and to guard againſt the conſequences which may reſult from it. I am charged by his excellency to mention it to Congreſs is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that has employed much of his thought, and that ſeems worthy of the moſt ſerious attention. He has communicated
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:031423_0244_0FEF8BD84B64CF20"/>
it to ſeveral of the general and other officers, and to many gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen of ſenſe and diſcernment, who all agree with him, not only upon the propriety, but the abſolute neceſſity that two diſtinct armies ſhould be formed,—one to act particularly in the ſtates which lie on the eaſt, the other in thoſe that are on the ſouth of the river;—the whole however to be raiſed on a general plan, and not to be confined to any particular place by the terms of enliſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Theſe matters,—the apparent difficulty and perhaps im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicability of ſuccours being thrown acroſs the river while the enemy can command it,—have induced his excellency to ſubmit the meaſures to their conſideration, not knowing how their opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be directed, and foreſeeing that innumerable evils may ariſe if a reſpectable force is not appointed to oppoſe their arms, wherever they are carried.</p>

                  <p>THE ſituation of of our affairs not permitting his excellency to write himſelf, I have it in charge to inform you, that, on yeſterday morning about ten o'clock, the enemy appeared in ſeveral large columns in our front, and, from their firſt movements, ſeemed as if they meant an attack there. However, halting for a little time, their main body filed off to the left, and preſently began a moſt ſevere and inceſſant cannonade, at a part of our troops who had taken poſt on a hill, with a view of throwing up ſome lines. At the ſame time they advanced in two diviſions, and, after a ſmart engagement for about a quarter of an hour, obliged our men to give way.</p>
                  <p>Our loſs is not certainly known; but, from conjecture, is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween four and five hundred in killed, wounded, and miſſing.—What theirs was, we have not heard.</p>
                  <p>After gaining the hill (upon which they are intrenching) and leaving a ſufficient number of men and artillery to prevent our repoſſeſſing it, they proceeded to advance by our left: and, as far as I can diſcover, their poſts or encampments now form nearly a ſemi-circle. It is evident their deſign is to get in our rear according to their original plan.—Every meaſure is taking to prevent them: but the removal of our baggage, &amp;c. is attended with infinite difficulty and delays.</p>
                  <p>Our poſt, from its ſituation, is not ſo advantageous as could be wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="246" facs="unknown:031423_0245_0FEF8BB00E01EC18"/>
till the ſtores belonging to the army, which had been depoſited here, could be removed. The enemy coming on ſo ſuddenly has diſtreſſed us much. They are now cloſe at hand, and moſt proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly will in a little time commence their ſecond attack; we expect it every hour:—perhaps it is beginning: I have juſt heard the report of ſome cannon.</p>

The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my are throwing up ſome lines and redoubts in our front, with a view of cannonading as ſoon as they are ready; and at the ſame time are extending their wings farther by our right and left. It is ſuppoſed that one of their objects is to advance a part of their troops, and ſeize on the bridge over Croton river, that the communication may be cut off with the upper country. To prevent this, a part of our force is detached, with orders to proceed with the utmoſt expedition, and to ſecure the paſs if poſſible.</p>
                  <p>We are trying to remove, to guard againſt their deſigns, but are greatly impeded by reaſon of the ſcarcity of waggons in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to our baggage and ſtores. Every exertion has been em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to obtain a ſufficiency; but they cannot be had in this part of the country. The quarter-maſter has ſent to Connecticut to get a ſupply if poſſible.</p>
                  <p>Our army is decreaſing faſt. Several gentlemen, who have come to camp within a few days, have obſerved large numbers of militia returning home on the different roads: nor are any meaſures taken as yet to raiſe the new army, no commiſſions having come from the ſtates to appoint or ſignify the nomination of their officers. If this was done, perhaps many who are now here might be induced to engage: but at preſent there are none authoriſed to recruit.</p>

As the bundle was taken away in ſo ſudden and ſecret a manner, I fear there is but little hope of recovering it,—being done moſt probably for the expreſs pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of furniſhing the enemy with intelligence, and a ſtate of our army. Beſides his excellency's letters, the moſt material of which was to Mr. Rutledge, there were five or ſix more from the gentlemen of his family.</p>
                  <p>My letters of the twenty-ninth and of yeſterday, which I had the honor of addreſſing you, will give a pretty full account of our ſituation, and of every matter reſpecting this army, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tecedent to this date. I only omitted to mention that we have taken thirteen of the Waldeckers, and that, for ſeveral days paſt, our ſcouting parties have brought in one, two, or three priſoners. In addition to theſe, we have every day a deſerter or two.</p>
                  <p>About ſix o'clock this morning, a meſſenger arrived from lord Sterling (who is with his brigade between two and three miles from White-Plains, on our right, and rather nearer the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>river) with intelligence that the enemy were advancing towards him in two columns. This information has carried his excellency and aids out. The reſult of their movement I have not heard: but moſt likely they are purſuing their original deſign of getting by our flanks and ſeizing the heights above us. Every precaution is taking to prevent them, and to hurry away our ſtores to a more interior part of the country.</p>

                     <p>P. S. His excellency has juſt returned, and ſays the alarm was premature. It aroſe from ſome of lord Sterling's advanced guards ſeeing a body of our men who had been ordered to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force him, who were ſuppoſed to be the enemy. His excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency is very apprehenſive that the army will be greatly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed for want of proviſion, particularly in the article of flour, owing to the water-conveyance, both in the North and Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>river
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:031423_0247_0FEF8BE00F0B7C78"/>
being in the enemy's poſſeſſion. He has wrote to the convention of this ſtate, and directed Mr. Trumbull, that their utmoſt exertions in this inſtance may be uſed. There is a good deal of flour on the Jerſey ſide: but there is no other way to get it, but by carting and ferrying it over to Peekſkill. This I have wrote to general Greene to have done, by his excellency's direction.</p>

                  <p>BY command of his excellency, I have the honor to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge his receipt of your favor of the twenty-fourth ulti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mo, and to inform you that he eſteems the plan you propoſe to lay before Congreſs, for preventing more rations being drawn than may be due, well calculated to anſwer the end. That reſpecting the ſick ſeems to him not entirely perfect. The cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains or commanders of companies are prohibited from drawing pay for ſuch ſick as may be diſcharged from the hoſpitals as unfit for ſervice. If, during their ſtay, and before it can be known whether their caſe will or will not admit of their return, it ſhould become neceſſary to make up a regimental pay-abſtract, in what manner are the officers to make up their rolls? are they to include the ſick or not?</p>
                  <p>As this is a caſe which may and muſt of neceſſity frequently happen, it appears to his excellency that the intended regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ſhould be more general, and reſtrain the officers from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding in their pay-abſtracts or rolls all the ſick they ſend to the hoſpitals, and the pay due them previous to their going. In
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:031423_0248_0FEF8D3CA2104A88"/>
ſuch caſe, thoſe who are diſcharged as unfit for ſervice may receive their pay as intended; and thoſe who return to duty can obtain what was due to them when the regiment was paid, by applying to the paymaſter with the officer and ſurgeon's certificates, or be included in a ſubſequent abſtract. The inconveniences and abuſes which are deſigned to be remedied by theſe regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, his excellency does not apprehend to ariſe ſo much from neceſſity (as incident to the nature of armies), as from the imperfect inſtitution of the preſent, and the great mixture and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity of troops compoſing it, and alſo from the inattention of the officers. * * *</p>
                  <p>The defenceleſs ſtate of Pennſylvania, as communicated by the committee of ſafety to your honorable body, is a matter of much concern to his excellency, who is not a little aggravated by the part too many ſeem ready to take in favor of the enemy. He truſts, however, the defection will be too inconſiderale to threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en any alarming conſequences.</p>
                  <p>Before the receipt of your letter, his excellency had wrote to the commanding officer of the Virginia regiments at Trenton, di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recting him to march them forward towards general Greene's poſt, and there remain under his command till further or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, unleſs ſpecial inſtructions had been or ſhould be given to the contrary by Congreſs, or for their particular deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Agreeable to your requeſt, his excellency has conſulted with general Lee upon the beſt mode for employing the French gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, and making them ſerviceable. The reſult is that they ſhould be appointed to regiments by Congreſs according to the ranks they have been pleaſed to give them, and with the ſame pay as is allowed other officers in ſuch caſes. Their want of our language is rather an objection: but it is hoped they will attain a ſufficient knowledge of it, ere it be long, to be of great ſervice; and that, in the interim, their advice and aſſiſtance in directing of works may be of uſe where they may be ſtationed.—With great reſpect, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE the honor to inform you that on yeſterday morning the enemy made a ſudden and unexpected movement from the ſeveral poſts they had taken in our front. They
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:031423_0249_0FEC5B4C73CB3760"/>
broke up their whole encampments the preceding night, and have advanced towards Kingſbridge and the North-river. The de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of this manoeuvre is a matter of much conjecture and ſpeculation, and cannot be accounted for with any degree of certainty. The grounds we had taken poſſeſſion of were ſtrong and advantageous, and ſuch as they could not have gained without much loſs of blood in caſe an attempt had been made. I had taken every precaution to prevent their out-flanking us;—which may have led to the preſent meaſure. They may ſtill have in view their original plan, and, by a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den wheel, try to accompliſh it. Detachments are conſtantly out to obſerve their motions, and to harraſs them as much as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>In conſequence of this movement I called a council of general officers to-day, to conſult of ſuch meaſures as ſhould be adopted in caſe they purſued their retreat to New-York; the reſult of which is herewith tranſmitted. In reſpect to myſelf, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not indulge an idea that general Howe, ſuppoſing he is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to New-York, means to cloſe the campaign, and to ſit down without attempting ſomething more. I think it highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and almoſt certain, that he will make a deſcent with a part of his troops into Jerſey; and, as ſoon as I am ſatisfied that the preſent manoeuvre is real and not a feint, I ſhall uſe every means in my power to forward a part of our force to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract his deſigns; nor ſhall I be diſappointed if he ſends a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to the ſouthward for the purpoſe of making a winter cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign.</p>
                  <p>From the information I have received, there is now a number of tranſports at Red-Hook, with about three thouſand troops on board. Their deſtination, as given out, is to Rhode-Iſland; but this ſeems altogether improbable for various reaſons; a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong others, the ſeaſon is much againſt it. In the ſouthern ſtates they will find it milder, and much more favorable for their purpoſes. I ſhall take the liberty of mentioning that it may not be improper to ſuggeſt the probability of ſuch a meaſure to the aſſemblies and conventions in thoſe ſtates, that they may be on their guard,—and the propriety of their eſtabliſhing and laying up magazines of proviſions and other neceſſaries in ſuitable places. This is a matter of exceeding importance, and what cannot be too much attended to.</p>
                  <p>From the approaching diſſolution of the army, and the depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the new levies which is on the eve of taking place, and the little proſpect of levying a new one in time, I have wrote to the eaſtern ſtates by the unanimous advice of the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:031423_0250_0FEC5B4E544525E0"/>
officers, to forward ſupplies of militia in the room of thoſe that are now here, and who, it is feared, will not be prevailed on to ſtay any longer than the time they are engaged for. The pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of this application, I truſt, will appear, when it is known that not a ſingle officer is yet commiſſioned to recruit, and when it is conſidered how eſſential it is to keep up ſome ſhew of force and ſhadow of an army.</p>
                  <p>I expect the enemy will bend their force againſt Fort-Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, and inveſt it immediately. From ſome advices it is an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject that will attract their earlieſt attention.</p>
                  <p>I am happy to inform you, that, in the engagement on monday ſe'nnight, I have reaſon to believe our loſs was by no means ſo conſiderable as was conjectured at firſt. By ſome deſerters and priſoners we are told, that of the enemy was tolerably great; ſome accounts make it about four hundred in killed and wounded: all agree that among the former there was a colonel Carr of the thirty-fifth regiment.</p>
                  <p>The force that will be ſent to Jerſey after I am ſatisfied of Mr. Howe's retreat, in addition to thoſe now there, according to my preſent opinion, will make it neceſſary for me to go with them, to put things in a proper channel, and ſuch a way of defence as ſhall ſeem moſt probable to check the progreſs of the enemy, in caſe they ſhould attempt a deſcent there, or a move to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Philadelphia.</p>

They this minute came to hand; and to them I beg leave to refer you for particulars.</p>
                  <p>By every information I can obtain, and the accounts I had laſt night by two deſerters who were very intelligent and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, general Howe ſtill has in view an expedition to the Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys, and is preparing for it with the greateſt induſtry. I have detached the firſt diviſion of our troops which was thought neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to be ſent, and which I hope will croſs the river at Peekſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kill to-day. The ſecond, I expect, will all march this even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and to-morrow morning I propoſe to follow myſelf, in order to put things in the beſt train I can, and to give him every poſſible oppoſition.—I hope (when the two diviſions arrive, and are joined to ſuch other force as I expect to collect) to check his progreſs and prevent him from penetrating any diſtance from the river, if not to oblige him to return immediately with ſome loſs. Whatever is in my power to effect, ſhall be done.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE only time to acknowledge the honor of your letter of the fifth inſtant, and its ſeveral incloſures, and to inform you, that, agreeable to the reſolves of Congreſs, I ſhall uſe every meaſure in my power that the moving and preſent confuſed ſtate of the army will admit of, to appoint officers for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting.</p>
                  <p>You will have been adviſed, before this, of the arrival of commiſſioners from the Maſſachuſetts. Others have come from Connecticut: but, from the preſent appearance of things, we ſeem but little if any nearer to levying an army. I had anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the reſolve reſpecting the militia, by writing to the eaſtern ſtates and to the Jerſey, by the advice of my general offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:031423_0252_0FEC5B5733FAF9F0"/>
and from a conſciouſneſs of the neceſſity of getting in a number of men if poſſible, to keep up the appearance of an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. How my application will ſucceed, the event muſt deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine. I have little or no reaſon to expect that the militia now here will remain a day longer than the time they firſt engaged for. I have recommended their ſtay, and requeſted it in general orders. General Lincoln and the Maſſachuſetts commiſſioners are uſing their intereſt with thoſe from that ſtate: but, as far as I can judge, we cannot rely on their ſtaying.</p>
                  <p>I left White-Plains about eleven o'clock yeſterday;—all peace then. The enemy appeared to be preparing for their expedition to Jerſey according to every information. What their deſigns are, or whether their preſent conduct is not a feint, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not determine.</p>
                  <p>The Maryland and Virginia troops under lord Sterling have croſſed the river, as have part of theſe from the Jerſey: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder are now embarking. The troops, judged neceſſary to ſecure the ſeveral poſts through the Highlands, have alſo got up. I am going to examine the paſſes, and direct ſuch works as may appear neceſſary; after which, and making the beſt diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition I can of things in this quarter, I intend to proceed to Jerſey, which I expect to do to-morrow.</p>
                  <p>The Aſſemblies of Maſſachuſetts and Connecticut, to induce their men more readily to en<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>age in the ſervice, have voted an advance pay of twenty ſhillings per month, in addition to that allowed by the Congreſs to privates. It may perhaps be the means of their levying the quotas exacted from them ſooner than they could otherwiſe have been raiſed: but I am of opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, a more fatal and miſtaken policy could not have entered their councils, or one more detrimental to the general cauſe. The influence of the vote will become continental, and materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally effect the other ſtates in making up their levies. If they could do it, I am certain, when the troops come to act toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that jealouſy, impatience and mutiny, would neceſſarily ariſe. A different pay cannot exiſt in the ſame army. The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons are obvious, and experience has proved their force in the caſe of the eaſtern and ſouthern troops laſt ſpring. Senſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble of this, and of the pernicious conſequences that would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>evitably reſult from the advance, I have prevented the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners from proceeding or publiſhing their terms till they could obtain the ſenſe of Congreſs upon the ſubject, and remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated againſt it in a letter to governor Trumbull. I am not ſingular in opinion: I have the concurrence of all the general offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers, of its fatal tendency.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE the honor to inform you of my arrival here yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday, and that the whole of the troops belonging to the ſtates, which lay ſouth of Hudſon's river, and which were in New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>York government, have paſſed over to this ſide, except the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment, lately colonel Smallwood's, which I expect is now on their march.</p>
                  <p>That they may be ready to check any incurſion the enemy may attempt in this neighborhood, I intend to quarter them at Brunſwick, Amboy, Elizabeth-Town, Newark, and about this place, unleſs Congreſs ſhould conceive it neceſſary for any of them to be ſtationed at or more contiguous to Philadelphia. In ſuch caſe they will be pleaſed to ſignify their pleaſure. There will be very few of them after the departure of thoſe who were engaged for the flying camp, which is faſt approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. The diſpoſition I have mentioned ſeems to me well cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated for the end propoſed, and alſo for their acccommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The movements and deſigns of the enemy are not yet under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood. Various are the opinions and reports on this head. From every information, the whole have removed from Dobbs's fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry towards Kingſbridge: and it ſeems to be generally believed on all hands, that the inveſting of Fort-Waſhington is one ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject they have in view; but that can employ but a ſmall part of their force. Whether they intend a ſouthern expedition, muſt be determined by time: to me there appears a probability of it, which ſeems to be favored by the advices we have that ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny tranſports are wooding and watering. General Greene's letter would give you the ſubſtance of the intelligence brought by Mr. Merſereau from Staten-Iſland in this inſtance, which he received before it came to me.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed you have copies of two letters from general Howe, and of my anſwer to the firſt of them. The letter alluded to, and returned in his laſt, was one from myſelf to Mrs. Waſhing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, of the twenty-fifth ultimo, from whence I conclude that all the letters which went by the Boſton expreſs have come to his poſſeſſion. You will alſo perceive that general Howe has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſted
<pb n="255" facs="unknown:031423_0254_0FEC5B5B5BD06C20"/>
the return of Peter Jack, a ſervant to major Stewart, to which I have conſented, as he was not in the military line, and the requiſition agreeable to the cuſtom of war. This ſervant hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing been ſent to Philadelphia with the Waldeckers and other priſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners, I muſt requeſt the favor of you to have him conveyed to general Greene by the earlieſt opportunity, in order that he may be returned to his maſter.</p>
                  <p>Before I conclude, I beg leave not only to ſuggeſt but to urge the neceſſity of increaſing our field artillery very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly. Experience has convinced me, as it has every gentleman of diſcernment in this army, that, while we remain ſo much inferior to the enemy in this inſtance, we muſt carry on the war under infinite diſadvantages, and without the ſmalleſt probability of ſucceſs. It has been peculiarly owing to the ſituation of the country where their operations have been conducted, and to the rough and ſtrong grounds we poſſeſſed ourſelves of, and over which they had to paſs, that they have not carried their arms, by means of their artillery, to a much greater extent. When theſe difficulties ceaſe by changing the ſcene of action to a level campaign country, the worſt of conſequences are to be apprehended. I would therefore, with the concurrence of all the officers whom I have ſpoken to upon the ſubject, ſubmit to the conſideration of Congreſs whether immediate meaſures ought not to be taken for procuring a reſpectable train.</p>
                  <p>It is agreed on all hands that each battalion ſhould be fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed at leaſt with two pieces, and that a ſmaller number than a hundred of three pounds, fifty of ſix pounds, and fifty of twelve pounds, ſhould not be provided, in addition to thoſe we now have. Beſides theſe, if ſome eighteen and twenty-four-pounders are ordered, the train will be more ſerviceable and complete. The whole ſhould be of braſs, for the moſt obvious reaſons; they will be much more portable, not half ſo liable to burſt; and, when they do, no damage is occaſioned by it, and they may be caſt over again. The ſizes before deſcribed ſhould be particularly attended to: if they are not, there will be great reaſon to expect miſtakes and confuſion in the charges in time of action, as it has frequently happened in the beſt-regulated armies. The diſparity between thoſe I have mentioned and ſuch as are of an intermediate ſize is difficult to diſcern.</p>
                  <p>It is alſo agreed that a regiment of artilleriſts, with approved and experienced officers, ſhould be obtained if poſſible, and ſome engineers of known reputation and abilities. I am ſorry to ſay, too ready an indulgence has been had to ſeveral appointments in
<pb n="256" facs="unknown:031423_0255_0FEC5B6108DC0D18"/>
the latter inſtance, and that men have been promoted, who ſeem to me to know but very little if any thing of the buſineſs.</p>
                  <p>Perhaps this train, &amp;c. may be looked upon by ſome as large and expenſive. True, it will be ſo: but when it is conſidered that the enemy, having effected but little in the courſe of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent campaign, will uſe their utmoſt efforts to ſubjugate us in the next; every conſideration of that ſort ſhould be diſregarded, and every poſſible preparation made to fruſtrate their * * * at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts. How they are to be procured, is to be enquired into.—That we cannot provide them among ourſelves, or more than a very ſmall proportion, ſo trifling as not to deſerve our notice, is evident. Therefore I would adviſe, with all imaginable defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, that, without any abatement of our own internal exertions, application ſhould be immediately made to ſuch powers as can and may be willing to ſupply them. They cannot be obtained too early if ſoon enough; and I am told they may be eaſily had from France and Holland.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Trumbull the commiſſary-general has frequently mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to me of late the inadequacy of his pay to his trouble and the great riſk he is ſubject to on account of the large ſums of money which paſs through his hands. He has ſtated his caſe with a view of laying it before Congreſs and obtaining a more adequate compenſation. My ſentiments upon the ſubject are already known: but yet I ſhall take the liberty to add that I think his complaint to be well founded, and his pay, conſidering the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant duties and riſks of his office, by no means ſufficient, and that the footing he ſeems to think it ſhould be upon, himſelf, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears juſt and reaſonable.</p>
                  <p>A propoſition having been made long ſince to general Howe and agreed to by him, for an exchange of priſoners in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the reſolutions of Congreſs to that effect, I ſhall be extremely happy if you will give directions to the committees and thoſe having the charge of priſoners in the ſeveral ſtates ſouth of Jerſey, to tranſmit me proper liſts of the names of all the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned officers, and of their ranks and the corps they belong to; alſo the number of non-commiſſioned and privates, and their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective regiments. You will perceive by his letter, he ſuppoſes me to have affected ſome delay, or to have been unmindful of the propoſition I had made.</p>
                  <p>I propoſe to ſtay in this neighborhood a few days, in which time I expect the deſigns of the enemy will be more diſcloſed, and their incurſions be made in this quarter, or their inveſtiture of Fort Waſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ington, if they are intended.</p>

                  <p>SINCE I had the honor of addreſſing you laſt, an important event has taken place, of which I wiſh to give you the earlieſt intelligence.</p>
                  <p>The preſervation of the paſſage of the North-river was an object of ſo much conſequence that I thought no pains or expenſe too great for that purpoſe: and therefore, after ſending off all the valuable ſtores except ſuch as were neceſſary for its defence, I determined, agreeable to the advice of moſt of the general officers, to riſk ſomething to defend the poſt on the eaſt ſide, called Mount-Waſhington.</p>
                  <p>When the army moved up in conſequence of general Howe's landing at Frog-Point, colonel Magaw was left on that command, with about twelve hundred men, and orders given to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend it to the laſt. Afterwards, reflecting upon the ſmallneſs of the garriſon, and the difficulty of their holding it if general Howe ſhould fall down upon it with his whole force, I wrote to general Greene who had the command on the Jerſey ſhore, directing him to govern himſelf by circumſtances, and to retain or evacuate the poſt as he ſhould think beſt, and revoking the abſolute order to colonel Magaw to defend the poſt to the laſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity.—General Greene, ſtruck with the importance of the poſt, and the diſengagement which our evacuation of poſts muſt neceſſarily have given, reinforced colonel Magaw with de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments from ſeveral regiments of the flying camp, but chiefly of Pennſylvania, ſo as to make up the number about two thouſand.</p>
                  <p>In this ſituation things were yeſterday, when general Howe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded the ſurrendry of the garriſon, to which colonel Magaw re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned a ſpirited refuſal. Immediately upon receiving an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of this tranſaction, I came from Hackinſac to this place, and had partly croſſed the North-river when I met general Putnam and general Greene, who were juſt returning from thence, and informed me that the troops were in high ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits, and would make a good defence: and it being late at night, I returned.</p>
                  <p>Early this morning colonel Magaw poſted his troops partly in the lines thrown up by our army on our firſt coming thither from New-York, and partly on a commanding hill lying north of Mount-Waſhington,—the lines being all to the ſouthward. In this poſition the attack began about ten o'clock, which our troops ſtood, and returned the fire in ſuch a manner as gave me great hopes the enemy was entirely repulſed. But at this
<pb n="259" facs="unknown:031423_0259_0FEC5B69AD74BFD0"/>
time a body of troops croſſed Haerlem-river in boats and landed inſide of the ſecond lines, our troops being then engaged in the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Colonel Cadwallader, who commanded in the lines, ſent off a detachment to oppoſe them: but they, being overpowered by numbers, gave way; upon which, colonel Cadwallader order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his troops to retreat in order to gain the fort. It was done with much confuſion; and the enemy croſſing over came in upon them in ſuch a manner, that a number of them ſurrender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                  <p>At this time the Heſſians advanced on the north ſide of the fort in a very large body. They were received by the troops poſted there, with proper ſpirit, and kept back a conſiderable time: but at length they were alſo obliged to ſubmit to a ſuperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority of numbers, and retire under the cannon of the fort.</p>
                  <p>The enemy, having advanced thus far, halted; and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately a flag went in, with a repetition of the demand of the fortreſs, as I ſuppoſe. At this time I ſent a billet to colonel Magaw, directing him to hold out, and I would endeavor this evening to bring off the garriſon, if the fortreſs could not be maintained, as I did not expect it could, the enemy being poſſeſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the adjacent ground. But, before this reached him he had entered too far into a treaty, to retract; after which, colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Cadwallader told another meſſenger who went over, that they had been able to obtain no other terms than to ſurren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der as priſoners of war. In this ſituation matters now ſtand. I have ſtopped general Beall's and general Heard's brigades to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the poſt and ſtores here; which, with the other troops, I hope we ſhall be able to effect.</p>
                  <p>I do not yet know the numbers killed or wounded on either ſide: but, from the heavineſs and continuance of the fire in ſome places, I imagine there muſt have been conſiderable execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>The loſs of ſuch a number of officers and men, many of whom have been trained with more than common attention, will, I fear, be ſeverely felt; but, when that of the arms and accoutre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments is added, much more ſo; and muſt be a further incentive to procure as conſiderable a ſupply as poſſible for the new troops, as ſoon as it can be done.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE not yet been able to obtain a particular account of the unhappy affair of the ſixteenth, nor of the terms on which the garriſon ſurrendered. The intelligence that has come to hand is not ſo full and accurate as I could wiſh. One of the artillery, whoſe information is moſt direct, and who eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped on ſunday night, ſays the enemy's loſs was very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable, eſpecially in the attack made above the fort by the divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Heſſians that marched from Kingſbridge, and where lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant-colonel Rawlins, of the late colonel Stephenſon's regiment, was poſted.</p>
                  <p>They burned yeſterday one or two houſes on the heights, and contiguous to the fort, and appeared, by advices from general Greene, to be moving in the evening their main body down to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the city Whether they will cloſe the campaign without at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting ſomething more, or make an incurſion into jerſey, muſt be determined by the events themſelves.</p>
                  <p>As Fort-Lee was always conſidered as only neceſſary in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with that on the eaſt ſide of the river, to preſerve the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication acroſs, and to prevent the enemy from a free na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vigation, it has become of no importance by the loſs of the other, or not ſo material as to employ force for its defence. Being viewed in this light, and apprehending that the ſtores there would be precariouſly ſituated, their removal has been de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined on to Boundbrook above Brunſwic, Princeton, Spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field, and Aquackenunk-bridge, as places that will not be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to ſudden danger in caſe the enemy ſhould paſs the riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and which have been thought proper as repoſitories for ſome of our ſtores of proviſion and forage.</p>
                  <p>The troops belonging to the flying camp under generals Heard and Beall, with what remains of general Ewing's brigade, are now at Fort-Lee, where they will continue till the ſtores are got away. By the time that is effected, their term of enliſtment will be near expiring; and, if the enemy ſhould make a puſh in this quarter, the only troops that there will be to oppoſe them, will be Hand's, Hazlett's, the regiment from Virginia, and that, lately Smallwood's,—the latter greatly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by the loſſes it ſuſtained on Long-Iſland, &amp;c. and ſick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: nor are the reſt by any means complete. In addition to theſe, I am told there are a few of the militia of this ſtate, who have been called in by governor Livingſton. I ſhall make ſuch a diſpoſition of the whole at Brunſwic and at the interme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate poſts, as ſhall ſeem moſt likely to guard againſt the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns
<pb n="261" facs="unknown:031423_0262_0FEC5B6F8551CD18"/>
of the enemy, and to prevent them making an irruption or foraging with detached parties.</p>
                  <p>The incloſed letter from colonels Miles and Atlee will ſhew Congreſs the diſtreſſed ſituation of our priſoners in New-York; and their diſtreſs will become greater every day by the cold inclement ſeaſon that is approaching. It will be happy if ſome expedient can be adopted, by which they may be furniſhed with neceſſary blankets and clothing. Humanity and the good of the ſervice require it.—I think the mode ſuggeſted by theſe gentlemen, for eſtabliſhing a credit, appears as likely to ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and as eligible, as any that occurs to me. It is probable many articles that may be wanted can be obtained there, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on better terms than elſewhere. In reſpect to proviſion, their al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowance perhaps is as good as the ſituation of general Howe's ſtores will admit of: it has been ſaid of late by deſerters and others that they were rather ſcant.</p>
                  <p>By a letter from the pay-maſter-general, of the ſeventeenth, he ſays there will be a neceſſity that large and early remittan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſhould be made. The demands, when the troops now in ſervice are diſmiſſed, will be extremely great. Beſides, the bounty recruits will require a large ſupply; and he adds that the commiſſary general has informed him, that, between this and the laſt of December, he ſhall have occaſion for a million of dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>November</hi> 21.—The unhappy affair of the ſixteenth has been ſucceeded by further misfortunes. Yeſterday morning a large body of the enemy landed between Dobbs's ferry and Fort-Lee. Their object was, evidently, to encloſe the whole of our troops and ſtores that lay between the North and Hack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſac rivers, which form a very narrow neck of land. For this purpoſe they formed and marched as ſoon as they had aſcended the high grounds towards the fort. Upon the firſt information of their having landed, and of their movements, our men were ordered to meet them; but finding their num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers greatly ſuperior, and that they were extending themſelves to ſeize on the paſſes over the river, it was thought prudent to withdraw our men; which was effected, and their retreat ſecured. We loſt the whole of the cannon that was at the fort (except two twelve-pounders) and a great deal of baggage, between two and three hundred tents, about a thouſand barrels of flour, and other ſtores in the quarter-maſter's department. This loſs was inevitable. As many of the ſtores had been remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as circumſtances and time would admit of. The ammunition had been happily got away.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="262" facs="unknown:031423_0263_0FEC5B75497F88A8"/>
Our preſent ſituation between Hackinſac and Paſſaic rivers being exactly ſimilar to our late one, and our force here by no means adequate to an oppoſition that will promiſe the ſmalleſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of ſucceſs, we are taking meaſures to retire over the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the latter, when the beſt diſpoſition will be formed that circumſtances will admit of.</p>
                  <p>By colonel Cadwallader, who has been permitted by general Howe to return to his friends, I am informed the ſurrender of the garriſon on the ſixteenth was on the common terms as pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners of war; the loſs of the Heſſians, about three hundred privates and twenty-ſeven officers killed and wounded; about forty of the Britiſh troops, and two or three officers: the loſs on our ſide but inconſiderable. I beg leave to refer you to him for a more particular account, and alſo for his relation of the diſtreſſes of our priſoners.—Colonels Miles and Atlee's letter, mentioned above upon this ſubject, was through miſtake ſent from hence yeſterday morning. The mode of relief propoſed by them was a credit or ſupply of caſh through the means of Mr. Franks. This ſeems to be doubtful, as he is ſaid to be in confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by colonel Cadwallader,—provided it would have been other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe practicable.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE not yet heard that any proviſions is making to ſupply the place of the troops compoſing the flying camp, whoſe departure is now at hand. The ſituation of our affairs is truly critical, and ſuch as requires uncommon exertions on our part. From the movements of the enemy, and the information we have received, they certainly will make a puſh to poſſeſs them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of this part of the Jerſey.—In order that you may be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly appriſed of our weakneſs, and of the neceſſity there is of our obtaining early ſuccours, I have by the advice of the general of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers here, directed general Mifflin to wait on you. He is inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted with our circumſtances, and will repreſent them better than my hurried ſtate will allow.</p>
                  <p>I have wrote to general Lee to come over with the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental regiments immediately under his command: thoſe with general Heath I have ordered to ſecure the paſſes through the
<pb n="263" facs="unknown:031423_0264_0FEC5B76D2932080"/>
Highlands. I have alſo wrote to governor Livingſton requeſting of him ſuch aid as may be in his power; and would ſubmit it to the conſideration of Congreſs whether application ſhould not be made for part of Pennſylvania militia to ſtep forth at this preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing time.</p>
                  <p>Before I conclude, I would mention, if an early and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate ſupply of money could be ſent to Mr. Dalham to pay the flying-camp troops, it might have a happy effect. They would ſubſiſt themſelves comfortably on their return, provide many neceſſaries of which they are in great want; and moreover it might be the means of inducing many, after ſeeing their friends, to engage again.</p>
                  <p>I expected, on coming here, to have met with many of the militia, but find from inquiry that there are not more than from four to five hundred at the different poſts.</p>

                  <p>I DO myſelf the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the twenty-firſt and twenty-fourth, with their ſeveral incloſures. The execution of the reſolves has been and will be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to as far as in my power.</p>
                  <p>I have wrote to general Schuyler to ſend down as early as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the troops in the northern department from this and the ſtate of Pennſylvania. The propoſition for exchanging Mr. Franklin for general Thompſon I ſhall ſubmit to general Howe, as ſoon as cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances will allow me.</p>
                  <p>I have nothing in particular to adviſe you of, reſpecting the enemy, more than they are advancing this way. Part of them have paſſed the Paſſaic; and I ſuppoſe the main body that they have on this ſide the North-river would have done the ſame before now (as they are coming on), had their progreſs not been retarded by the weather which has been rainy for ſeveral days paſt, I have ſcouts and detachments conſtantly out to harraſs them and watch their motions, and to gain, if poſſible, intelligence of their deſigns.</p>
                  <p>Colonel Miles, who has been permitted to go to Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia for a few days by general Howe, will deliver you this, and inform you of the diſtreſſes of our priſoners, and the neceſſity of effecting their exchange as far as we have priſoners to give in return.</p>

<pb n="264" facs="unknown:031423_0265_0FEC5B7BD60E9F28"/>
they mention that ſeveral of the priſoners in our hands have enliſted. It is a meaſure, I think, that cannot be juſtified though the precedent is furniſhed on the ſide of the enemy: nor do I conceive it good in point of policy. But, as it has been done, I ſhall leave it with Congreſs to order them to be returned or not, as they ſhall judge fit.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE been honored with your favor of the twenty-ſixth, and with its incloſures, by which I perceive the meaſures that have been adopted for forwarding a reinforcement of militia. Their arrival is much to be wiſhed, the ſituation of our affairs being truly alarming, and ſuch as demands the earlieſt aids. As general Mifflin's preſence may have a happy influence on the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition and temper of many of the aſſociators, I ſhall not direct his return ſo long as he can be done without, and till it becomes indiſpenſably neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>On thurſday morning I left Newark, and arrived here yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day with the troops that were there. It was the opinion of all the generals who were with me, that a retreat to this place was requiſite, and founded in neceſſity, as our force was by no means ſufficient to make a ſtand, with the leaſt probability of ſucceſs, againſt an enemy much ſuperior in number, and whoſe advanced guards were entering the town by the time our rear got out. It was the wiſh of all to have remained there longer, and to have halted before we came thus far; but, upon due conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our ſtrength, the circumſtances attending the enliſtment of a great part of our little force, and the frequent advices that the enemy were embarking or about to embark another detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for Staten-Iſland with a view of landing at Amboy to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with this, which ſeemed to be confirmed by the infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of ſome perſons who came from the iſland, that they were collecting and impreſſing all the waggons they could find,—it was judged neceſſary to proceed till we came here, not only to prevent their bringing a force to act upon our front and rear, but alſo that we might be more convenient to oppoſe any troops they might land at South-Amboy, which many conjectured to be an object they had in view. This conjecture too had probability and ſome advices to ſupport it.</p>
                  <p>I hoped we ſhould have met with large and early ſuccours by this time; but as yet no great number of the militia of this
<pb n="265" facs="unknown:031423_0266_0FEC5B7DB98A4150"/>
ſtate has come in; nor have I much reaſon to expect that any conſiderable aid will be derived from the counties which lie be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this river, and in which the enemy are. Their ſituation will prevent it in a great meaſure from thoſe parts where they are, provided the inclinations of the people were good. Added to this, I have no aſſurances that more than a very few of the troops com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing the flying camp will remain after the time of their engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is out: ſo far from it, I am told that ſome of general Ew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing's brigade, who ſtand engaged to the firſt of January, are now going away. If thoſe go whoſe ſervice expires this day, our force will be reduced to a mere handful.</p>
                  <p>From intelligence received this morning, one diviſion of the enemy was advancing laſt night as far as Elizabeth-town, and ſome of their quarter-maſters had proceeded about four or five miles, on this ſide, to provide barns, &amp;c. for their accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Other accounts ſay another diviſion, compoſed of Heſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, are on the road through Springfield, and are reported to have reached that place laſt night. I do not know how far their views extend; but I doubt not, they mean to puſh eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry advantage reſulting from the ſmall number and ſtate of our troops.</p>
                  <p>I early began to forward part of the ſtores from this place to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Philadelphia. Many are gone: the reſt we are removing, and hope to ſecure.</p>

                  <p>I AM to acknowledge the receipt of your favors of the eighteenth, nineteenth, and twenty-third inſtant, which, from the unſettled ſituation of our affairs, I have not been able to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer before. That of the eighteenth incloſes a liſt of ſtores [<hi>imported</hi>] in the Hancock-and-Adams continental ſhip, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried into Dartmouth in New-England,—with a reſolve of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to deliver the muſkets, powder, lead, and flints, to my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. As the other articles of the cargo will be full as uſeful
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:031423_0267_0FEC5B80E7EDF838"/>
to the army as thoſe included in the reſolve, I would adviſe that directions be given to have the whole cargo removed from Dartmouth to ſome ſecure place in the neighborhood of Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, and there depoſited till called for. It is by no means proper that ſo great a quantity of military ſtores ſhould be lodged with the army, eſpecially at preſent, as we know not to-day where we ſhall be obliged to remove to-morrow: and that will in all proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility be the caſe while the enemy continue with a light army on this ſide the North-River.</p>
                  <p>In anſwer to that part of yours of the nineteenth in which you aſk my advice as to the propriety of enliſting priſoners of war, I would juſt obſerve, that, in my opinion, it is neither con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with the rules of war, nor politic: nor can I think, that becauſe our enemies have committed an unjuſtifiable action, by enticing, and, in ſome inſtances, intimidating our men in their ſervice, we ought to follow their example. Before I had the honor of yours on this ſubject, I had determined to remonſtrate to general Howe on this head. As to thoſe few who have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready enliſted, I would not have them again withdrawn and ſent in, becauſe they might be ſubjected to puniſhment: but I would have the practice diſcontinued in future. If you will revert to the capitulation of St. John's and Chamblee, you will find an expreſs ſtipulation againſt the enliſting the priſoners taken there.</p>
                  <p>I remarked that the enliſtment of priſoners was not a politic ſtep:—my reaſon is this, that in time of danger I have always obſerved ſuch perſons moſt backward, for fear (I ſuppoſe) of falling into the hands of their former maſters, from whom they expect no mercy: and this fear they are apt to communicate to their fellow-ſoldiers. They are alſo moſt ready to deſert when any action is expected, hoping, by carrying intelligence, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure their peace.</p>
                  <p>I met captain Heſketh on the road; and as the ſituation of his family did not admit of delay, I permitted him to go imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to New-York, not having the leaſt doubt but general Howe will make a return of any officer of equal rank who ſhall be required.</p>

                  <p>I YESTERDAY had the honor of writing you, and to adviſe you of our arrival here. I am now to inform you that
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:031423_0268_0FEC5B82C86F2630"/>
the enemy are ſtill advancing, and that their van-guard had proceeded as far as Bonem, a ſmall town about four miles this ſide of Woodbridge, according to my laſt intelligence. As to their number, reports are various. Some ſay they were joined yeſterday by a conſiderable reinforcement from Staten-Iſland. How far this fact may be true, I cannot determine: but, from every information, before, they were between ſix and ſeven thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand ſtrong.</p>
                  <p>I have for ſome time paſt ſuppoſed Philadelphia to be the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of their movement, and have every reaſon to believe my opinion well founded,—the advices of ſundry perſons, who have had an opportunity of mixing and converſing with them on the march, agreeing that ſuch is the report. I have wrote to govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or Livingſton upon the ſubject, requeſting his utmoſt exertions to forward on every ſuccour in his power. The ſame, I truſt, will be attended to in Pennſylvania. Without a ſufficient number of men and arms, their progreſs cannot be checked:—at preſent our force is totally inadequate to any attempt.</p>
                  <p>Several officers belonging to the enemy, who were priſoners, have obtained permiſſion to return. I have not yet ſent in the names of thoſe belonging to us, that are to be exchanged for them. By a Virginia paper, I perceive that captain Morgan and lieutenant Heath, who were taken priſoners at Quebec, and now on parole, are promoted in the late arrangement of officers in that ſtate,—the former to a regiment, the latter to a majority. It would be well if they were releaſed: but being Virginians, and not knowing that any gentleman who were taken at the ſame time are ſo circumſtanced, I have declined claiming their return without the opinion of Congreſs, leſt I ſhould incur the charge of partiality.</p>
                  <p>I have ſent forward colonel Humpton, to collect proper boats and crafts at the ferry, for tranſporting our troops: and it will be of infinite importance to have every other craft, beſides what he takes for the above purpoſe, ſecured on the weſt ſide of Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware: otherwiſe they may fall into the enemy's hands and facili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate their views.</p>

We had a ſmart cannonade whilſt we were parading our men, but without any or but little loſs on either ſide. It being impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to oppoſe them with our preſent force with the leaſt proſpect of ſucceſs, we ſhall retreat to the weſt ſide of Delaware (and have advanced about eight miles) where it is hoped we ſhall meet a reinforcement ſufficient to check their progreſs.

                  <p>I ARRIVED here this morning with our troops between eight and nine o'clock, when I received the honor of your letter of the firſt, with its incloſures.</p>
                  <p>When the enemy firſt landed on this ſide the North-river, I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended that they meant to make a puſh this way: and knowing that the force which I had was not ſufficient to oppoſe them, I wrote to general Lee to croſs with the ſeveral con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinental regiments in his diviſion, and hoped he would have arrived before now.—By ſome means or other he has been delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—I ſuppoſe he has paſſed the river, as his letter of the twenty-ſixth ultimo mentioned that he had marched a bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade the day before, and ſhould follow the next himſelf. The re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the troops I conceived neceſſary to guard the ſeveral paſſes through the Highlands; nor do I think they can be called from thence.

I am informed that they had not entered Brunſwic yeſterday morning at nine o'clock, but were on the oppoſite ſide of the Rariton.</p>
                  <p>Immediately on my arrival here, I ordered the removal of all the military and other ſtores and baggage over the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware: a great quantity are already got over; and as ſoon as boats come up from Philadelphia, we ſhall load them; by which means I hope to have every thing ſecured this night and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, if we are not diſturbed. After being diſencumbered of my baggage and ſtores, my future ſituation will depend entirely upon circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>I have not heard a word from General Lee ſince the twenty-ſixth of laſt month; which ſurpriſes me not a little, as I have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched daily expreſſes to him, deſiring to know when I might look for him. This makes me fearful that my letters have not reached him. I am informed by report that general St. Clair has joined him with three or four regiments from the northward. To know the truth of this, and alſo when I may ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect him, and with what numbers, I have this minute diſpatched colonel Stewart (General Gates's aid-de-camp) to meet general Lee and bring me an account.</p>
                  <p>I look out earneſtly for the reinforcement from Philadelphia. I am in hopes, that, if we can draw a good head of men together, it will give ſpirits to the militia of this ſtate, who have as yet af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded me little or no aſſiſtance; nor can I find they are likely to do much.</p>

General Heard juſt informs me that a perſon, on whoſe veracity he can depend, has reported to him that on ſunday laſt he counted a hundred and ſeventeen ſail of ſhips going out of the Hook. You may depend upon being adviſed inſtantly of any further movement in the enemy's army or mine.</p>

                  <p>SINCE I had the honor of addreſſing you yeſterday, I recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved a letter from General Lee. On the thirtieth ultimo he was at Peekſkill, and expected to paſs the river with his divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion two days after. From this intelligence you will readily conclude that he will not be able to afford us any aid for ſeveral days. The report of general St. Clair's having joined them with three or four regiments, I believe to be altogether premature, as he mentions nothing of it. It has ariſen, as I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, from the return of ſome of the Jerſey and Pennſylvania troops from Tyconderoga, whoſe time of ſervice is expired. They have reached Pluckemin where I have wrote to have them halted and kept together, if they can be prevailed on, till further orders.</p>
                  <p>The incloſed is a copy of a letter which came to hand laſt night from major Clark, to which I beg leave to refer you for the intelligence it contains.—The number of the enemy ſaid to be embarked is ſuppoſed to be rather exaggerated. That there has been an embarkation, is not to be doubted, it being confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed through various channels. By colonel Griffin, who went from Brunſwic on ſunday morning with a captain Sims, to paſs him by our guards, and who was detained by lord Cornwallis till monday evening, on account of his ſituation, the amount of general Clinton's force, from what he could collect from the officers, was about ſix thouſand: as to their deſtination, he could not obtain the leaſt information. By him I alſo learn the enemy were in Brunſwic, and that ſome of their advanced parties had proceeded two miles on this ſide. The heavy rain that has fallen has probably checked their progreſs, and may prevent their frther movement for ſome time,</p>

                  <p>YOURS of the twentieth of laſt month was delivered to me by the brigadier La Roche de Fermoy, who is now here, but unable to render me that ſervice, which, I dare ſay, from his character, he would, were he better acquainted with our language.</p>
                  <p>I yeſterday received a letter from you without a date, mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that the priſoners from York-town were directed to halt at Newtown for my orders.

                  <p>I hope you have not ſent captain Price, lieutenant Peacock, and major Campbell, on to this place, as it is highly improper they ſhould ſee and know the ſituation of our army here and at Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton. They had better be ſent up, under the care of ſome perſon, to Newtown or that neighborhood, and there wait the arrival of ſome larger party, who, I imagine, will be ſoon forwarded from Lancaſter, and go in with them.</p>
                  <p>Lieutenant Symes came over to me at Brunſwic from Beth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lehem without the leaſt guard or eſcort; and a lieutenant of the ſeventh regiment went through our whole army, and was at laſt diſcovered by a mere accident.

Such an irregular mode of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering priſoners to go in alone muſt be put a ſtop to, or the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my will be as well acquainted with our ſituation as we are our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.

                  <p>AS nothing but neceſſity obliged me to retire before the enemy and leave ſo much of the Jerſeys unprotected, I conceive it my duty, and it correſponds with my inclination, to make head againſt them ſo ſoon as there ſhall be the leaſt probability of doing it with propriety. That the country might in ſome meaſure be covered, I left two brigades conſiſting of the five Virginia regiments and that of Delaware, containing in the whole about twelve hundred men fit for duty, under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of lord Sterling and general Stephen, at Princeton, till the baggage and ſtores could croſs the Delaware, or the troops under their reſpective commands ſhould be forced from thence. I ſhall now, having removed the greateſt part of the above ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles, face about with ſuch troops as are here fit for ſervice, and march back to Princeton, and there govern myſelf by cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances and the movements of general Lee. At any event, the enemy's progreſs may be retarded by this means, if they intend to come on, and the people's fears in ſome meaſure qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eted, if they do not. Sorry I am to obſerve, however, that the frequent calls upon the militia of this ſtate, the want of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion in the principal gentlemen of the country, or a fatal ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineneſs and inſenſibility of danger till it is too late to prevent an evil that was not only foreſeen but foretold, have been the cauſes of our late diſgraces.</p>
                  <p>If the militia of this ſtate had ſtepped forth in ſeaſon (and timely notice they had), we might have prevented the enemy's croſſing the Hackinſac, although without ſome previous notice of the time and place it was impoſſible to have done this at the North-river. We might with equal probability of ſucceſs have made a ſtand at Brunſwic on the Rariton. But as both theſe rivers were fordable in a variety of places (knee-deep only), it required many men to defend the paſſes; and theſe we had not. At Hackinſac our force was inſufficient, becauſe a part was at Elizabeth-town, Amboy, and Brunſwic, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>uarding a coaſt which I thought moſt expoſed to danger; and at Brunſwic, becauſe I was diſappointed in my expectation of militia, and becauſe on the day of the enemy's approach (and probably the occaſion of it) the term of the Jerſey and Maryland brigade' ſervice expired; neither of which would conſent to ſtay an hour lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                  <p>Theſe among ten thouſand other inſtances, might be adduced to ſhew the diſadvantages of ſhort enliſtments, and the little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon militia in times of real danger. But, as yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day
<pb n="273" facs="unknown:031423_0272_0FEC5B9999A00B18"/>
cannot be recalled, I will not dwell upon a ſubject which, no doubt, has given much uneaſineſs to Congreſs, as well as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme pain and anxiety to myſelf. My firſt wiſh is that Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs may be convinced of the impropriety of relying upon the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia, and of the neceſſity of raiſing a larger ſtanding army than what they have voted. The ſaving in the articles of ſtores, proviſions, and in a thouſand other things, by having nothing to do with the militia unleſs in caſe of extraordinary exigency, and ſuch as could not be expected in the common courſe of events, would amply ſupport a large army, which, well officered, would be daily improving, inſtead of continuing a deſtructive, expenſive, and diſorderly mob.</p>
                  <p>I am clear in opinion, that, if forty thouſand men had been kept in conſtant pay ſince the firſt commencement of hoſtilities, and the militia had been excuſed doing duty during that period, the continent would have ſaved money. When I reflect on the loſſes we have ſuſtained for want of good troops, the certainty of this is placed beyond a doubt of my mind. In ſuch caſe, the militia, who have been harraſſed and tired by repeated calls upon them (and farming and manufactures in a manner ſuſpended), would, upon any preſſing emergency, have ran with alacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to arms; whereas the cry now is, "they may be as well ruined one way as another;" and with difficulty they are obtained.</p>
                  <p>I mention theſe things, to ſhew, that, in my opinion, if any dependence is placed in the militia another year, Congreſs will be deceived. When danger is a little removed from them, they will not turn out at all. When it comes home to them, the well-affected; inſtead of flying to arms to defend themſelves, are buſily employed in removing their families and effects,—whilſt the diſaffected are concerting meaſures to make their ſubmiſſion, and ſpread terror and diſmay all around, to induce others to follow the example.—Daily experience and abundant proofs warrant this information.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall this day reinforce lord Sterling with about twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, which will make his number about two thouſand four hundred. To-morrow I mean to repair to Princeton myſelf, and ſhall order the Pennſylvania troops (who are not yet arrived, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept part of the German battalion and a company of light infantry) to the ſame place.</p>
                  <p>By my laſt advices, the enemy are ſtill at Brunſwic; and the account adds that general Howe was expected at Elizabeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>town with a reinforcement, to erect the king's ſtandard, and demand a ſubmiſſion of this ſtate.

                  <p>By a letter of the fourteenth ultimo from a Mr. Caldwell, a clergyman, and a ſtaunch friend to the cauſe, who has fled from Elizabeth-town, and taken refuge in the mountains about ten miles from hence, I am informed that general or lord Howe was expected in<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that town to publiſh pardon and peace.

                  <p>COLONEL Reed would inform you of the intelligence which I firſt met with on the road from Trenton to Princeton yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday. Before I got to the latter, I received a ſecond ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs informing me, that as the enemy were advancing by different routes, and attempting by one to get in the rear of our troops which were there (and whoſe numbers were ſmall, and the place by no means defenſible), they had judged it prudent to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat to Trenton. The retreat was accordingly made, and ſince to this ſide of the river.</p>
                  <p>This information I thought it my duty to communicate as ſoon as poſſible, as there is not a moment's time to be loſt in aſſembling ſuch force as can be collected; and as the object of
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:031423_0274_0FEC5B9FA59838C8"/>
the enemy cannot now be doubted in the ſmalleſt degree. Indeed I ſhall be out of my conjecture (for it is only conjecture) if the late embarkation at New-York is not for Deleware river, to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate with the army under the immediate command of general Howe, who I am informed from good authority, is with the Britiſh troops and his whole force upon this route.</p>
                  <p>I have no certain intelligence of general Lee, although I have ſent frequent expreſſes to him, and lately a colonel Humpton to bring me ſome accurate accounts of his ſituation. I laſt night diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patched another gentleman to him (major Hoops) deſiring he would haſten his march to the Deleware, in which I would provide boats near a place called Alexandria, for the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of his troops.—I cannot account for the ſlowneſs of his march.</p>
                  <p>In the diſordered and moving ſtate of the army, I cannot get returns: but from the beſt accounts, we had between three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand and three thouſand five hundred men, before the Philadelphia militia and German battallion arrived: they amount to about two thouſand.</p>

                  <p>I did myſelf the honor of writing to you yeſterday, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming you that I had removed the troops to this ſide of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware. Soon after the enemy made their appearance, and their van entered juſt as our rear guard quitted. We had removed all our ſtores, except a few boards.—From the beſt information, they are in two bodies, one at and near Trenton, the other ſome miles higher up, and inclining towards Delaware; but whether with intent to croſs there, or throw themſelves between general Lee and me, is yet uncertain.</p>
                  <p>I have this morning detached lord Stirling with his brigade, to take poſt at the different landing places, and prevent them from ſtealing a march upon us from above; for I am informed, if they croſs at Coryel's ferry or thereabouts, they are as near to Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, as we are here. From ſeveral accounts I am led to think that the enemy are bringing boats with them: if ſo it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for our ſmall force to give them any conſiderable op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition in the paſſage of the river, [<hi>as they may</hi>] make a feint at one place, and, by a ſudden removal, carry their boats higher or lower before we can bring our cannon to play upon them.</p>

Under theſe circumſtances, the ſecurity of Philadelphia ſhould be our next object. From my own remembrance, but more from information (for I never viewed the ground) I ſhould think that a communication of lines and redoubts might ſoon be form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the Delaware to Schuylkill on the north entrance of the city, the lines to begin on the Schuylkill <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ide, about the heights of Springatebury, and run eaſtward to Delaware, upon the moſt advantageous and commanding grounds. If ſomething of this kind is not done, the enemy might, in caſe any misfortune ſhould befal us, march directly, in and take poſſeſſion. We have ever found that lines, however ſlight, are very formidable to them: they would at leaſt give a check till people could recover of the fright and conſternation that naturally attends the firſt appearance of an enemy.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time every ſtep ſhould be taken to collect force, not only from Pennſylvania, but from the moſt neighborly ſtates. If we can keep the enemy from entering Philadelphia, and keep the communication by water open for ſupplies, we may yet make a ſtand, if the country will come to our aſſiſtance till our new levies can be collected.</p>
                  <p>If the meaſure of fortifying the city ſhould be adopted, ſome ſkilful perſon ſhould immediately view the grounds, and begin to trace out the lines and works. I am informed there is a French engineer of eminence in Philadelphia at this time: if ſo he will be the moſt proper.</p>

By a letter received laſt night from general Lee, of the eighth inſtant, he was then at Morriſtown, where he entertained thoughts of eſtabliſhing a poſt: but, on receiving my diſpatches by major Hoops, I ſhould ſuppoſe he would be convinced of the neceſſity of his proceeding this way with all the force he can bring.</p>

                  <p>AFTER I had wrote you yeſterday, I received certain in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation that the enemy, after repairing Crofwix's bridge, had advanced a party of about five hundred to Bordentown. By their taking this route, it confirms me in my opinion, that they have an intention to land between this and Philadelphia, as well as above, if they can procure boats for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>I laſt night directed commodore Seymour to ſtation all his gallies betweed Bordentown and Philadelphia, to give the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt intelligence of any appearance of the enemy or the Jerſey ſhore.</p>
                  <p>I yeſterday rode up the river about eleven miles, to lord Sterling's poſt, where I found a priſoner of the forty-ſecond re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment who had been juſt brought in. He informed me that lord Cornwallis was at Pennytown with two battalions of gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadiers, and three of light infantry, all Britiſh, the Heſſian grenadiers, the forty-ſecond Highland regiment, and two other battalions, the names of which he did not remember. He knew nothing of the reaſons of their being aſſembled there, nor what were their future intentions. But I laſt night received informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from lord Sterling, which had been brought in by his ſcouts, which in ſome meaſure accounted for there being there. They had made a forced march from Trenton on ſunday night, to Coryel's ferry, in hopes of ſurpriſing a ſufficient number of boats to tranſport them; but, finding themſelves diſappointed, had marched back to Pennytown, where they remained yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day.
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:031423_0277_0FEC5BABEEE0A028"/>
From their ſeveral attempts to ſeize boats, it does not look as if they had brought any with them, as I was at one time informed. I laſt night ſent a perſon over to Trenton, to learn whether there was any appearance of building any: but he could not perceive any preparations for a work of that kind; ſo that I am in hopes, if proper care is taken to keep all the craft out of their way, they will find the croſſing Delaware a matter of conſiderable difficulty.</p>
                  <p>I received another letter from general Lee laſt evening; it was dated at Chatham (which I take to be near Morriſtown) the eighth of this month. He had then received my letter ſent by major Hoops, but ſeemed ſtill inclined to hang upon the enemy's rear, to which I ſhould have no objection, had I a ſufficient force to oppoſe them in front: but as I have not at preſent, nor do I ſee much probability of further reinforcement, I have wrote to him in the moſt preſſing terms, to join me with all expedition.</p>
                  <p>Major Shelden, who commands the volunteer horſe from Connecticut, waits upon Congreſs to eſtabliſh ſome mode of pay. I can only ſay that the ſervice of himſelf and his troop has been ſuch as merits the warmeſt thanks of the public, and deſerves a handſome compenſation for their trouble. Whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is ſettled now, will ſerve for a precedent in future.—From the experience I have had, this campaign, of the utility of horſe, I am convinced there is no carrying on the war without them; and I would therefore recommend the eſtabliſhment of one or more corps (in proportion to the number of foot) in addition to thoſe already raiſed in Virginia. If major Shelden would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake the command of a regiment of horſe on the continental eſtabliſhment, I believe he could very ſoon raiſe them; and I can recommend him as a man of activity and ſpirit, from what I have ſeen of him.</p>

                  <p>I LAST night received the favor of Mr. Thompſon's letter incloſing the proceedings of Congreſs, of the eleventh inſtant.—As the publication of their reſolve, in my opinion, will not lead to any good end, but, on the contrary, may be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with ſome bad conſequences, I ſhall take the liberty to decline inſerting it in this day's orders. I am perſuaded, if the ſubject is taken up and reconſidered, that Congreſs will
<pb n="279" facs="unknown:031423_0278_0FEC5BAD9455B040"/>
concur with me in ſentiment. I doubt not but there are ſome who have propagated the report: but what if they have?—Their remaining in or leaving Philadelphia muſt be governed by circumſtances and events. If their departure ſhould become neceſſary, it will be right: on the other hand if there ſhould not be a neceſſity for it, they will remain, and their continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance will ſhew the report to be the production of calumny and falſehood. In a word, ſir, I conceive it a matter that may be as well diſregarded; and that the removal or ſtaying of Congreſs, depending entirely upon events, ſhould not have been the ſubject of a reſolve.</p>
                  <p>The intelligence we obtain reſpecting the movements and ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the enemy is far from being ſo certain and ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory as I could wiſh, though every probable means in my pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and that I can deviſe, are adopted for that purpoſe. The lateſt I have received was from lord Sterling, laſt night. He ſays that two grenadiers of the Inniſkillen regiments, who were taken and brought in by ſome countrymen, inform that gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals Howe, Cornwallis, Vaughan, &amp;c. with about ſix thouſand of the flying army, were at Pennytown, waiting for pontoons to come up, with which they mean to paſs the river near the Blue Mountains, or at Coryel's ferry,—they believe the latter:—that the two battallions of guards were at Brunſwic, and the Heſſian gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nadiers, chaſſeurs, and a regiment or two of the Britiſh troops, are at Trenton.</p>
                  <p>Captain Miller of colonel Hand's regiment alſo informs me, that a body of the enemy were marching to Burlington yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day morning. He had been ſent over with a ſtrong ſcouting party, and, at day-break, fell in with their advanced guards conſiſting of about four hundred Heſſian troops, who fired upon him before they were diſcovered, but without any loſs, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged him to retreat with his party and to take boat. The number of the whole he could not aſcertain: but it appeared to be conſiderable. Captain Miller's account is partly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed by commodore Seymour, who reports that four or five hundred of the enemy had entered the town. Upon the whole, there can be no doubt but that Philadelphia is their object, and that they will paſs the Delaware as ſoon as poſſible. Happy ſhould I be if I could ſee the means of preventing them: at preſent, I confeſs, I do not. All military writers agree that it is a work of great difficulty, nay, impracticable, where there is any extent of coaſt to guard. This is the caſe with us; and we have to do it with a force, ſmall and inconſiderable, and much inferior to that of the enemy. Perhaps Congreſs have
<pb n="280" facs="unknown:031423_0279_0FEC5BAF2A9DBE88"/>
ſome hope and proſpect of reinforcements: I have no intelligence of the ſort, and wiſh to be informed on the ſubject. Our little handful is daily decreaſing by ſickneſs and other cauſes: and, without aid, without conſiderable ſuccours and exertions on the part of the people, what can we reaſonably look for or expect, but an event that will be ſeverely felt by the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe, and that will wound the heart of every virtuous American,—the loſs of Philadelphia? The ſubject is diſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable, but yet it is true. I leave it, wiſhing that our ſituation may become ſuch as to do away the apprehenſions which at this time ſeem to fill the minds of too many, and with too much juſtice.</p>
                  <p>By a letter from general Heath, dated at Peekſkill, the eighth, I am adviſed that lieutenant-colonel Voſe was then there with Greaton's, Bond's, and Porter's regiments, amounting in the whole to between five and ſix hundred men, who were coming this way. He adds that generals Gates and Arnold would be at Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhen that night, with Stark's, Poor's, and Read's regiments; but for what purpoſe, he does not mention.</p>
                  <p>The incloſed extract of a letter which I received laſt night contains intelligence of an agreeable nature. I wiſh to hear its confirmation by the arrival of the ſeveral prizes: that with clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing and arms will be an invaluable acquiſition.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall be glad to be adviſed of the mode I am to obſerve in paying the officers; whether they are to be allowed to draw the pay lately eſtabliſhed, and from what time, or how long they are to be paid under the old eſtabliſhment. A pay-roll which was preſented yeſterday, being made up for the new, has given riſe to theſe propoſitions. Upon my objecting to it, I was told that Congreſs or the board of war had eſtabliſhed the prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by paying the ſixth regiment of Virginia troops commanded by colonel Buckner, agreeable to the latter, as they came through Philadelphia.</p>

                  <p>THE apparent deſigns of the enemy being to avoid this ferry, and land their troops above and below us, have induced me to remove from this place the greater part of the troops, and throw them into a different diſpoſition on the river, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by I hope not only to be more able to impede their paſſage, but, alſo to avoid the danger of being incloſed in this angle of
<pb n="281" facs="unknown:031423_0280_0FEC5BB71B70D760"/>
the river. And notwithſtanding the extended appearances of the enemy on the other ſide, made, at leaſt in part, to divert our attention from any particular point as well as to harraſs us by fatigue, I cannot diveſt myſelf of the opinion that their principal deſign is to ford the river ſomewhere above Trenton; to which deſign I have had particular reſpect in the new arrangement, wherein I am ſo far happy as to have the concurrence of the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral officers at this place.</p>
                  <p>Four brigades of the army, under generals lord Sterling, Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, Stephen and De Fermoy, extend from Yardley's up to Coryel's ferry, poſted in ſuch a manner as to guard every ſuſpicious part of the river, and to afford aſſiſtance to each other in caſe of attack. General Ewing, with the flying camp of Pennſylvania and a few Jerſey troops under general Dickinſon, are poſted from Yardley's ferry down to the ferry oppoſite Bordentown. Colonel Cadwalladar, with the Pennſylvania militia, occupies the ground above and below the mouth of Neſhaminy river as far down as Dunk's ferry, at which place colonel Nixon is poſted with the third battalion of [<hi>Pennſylvania</hi>]. A proper quantity of artillery is appointed to each brigade; and I have ordered ſmall redoubts to be thrown up oppoſite every place where there is a poſſibility of fording.—I ſhall remove further up the river to be near the main body of my ſmall army, with which every poſſible oppoſition ſhall be given to any further approach of the enemy towards Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia.</p>
                  <p>As general Armſtrong has a good deal of influence in this ſtate, and our preſent force is ſmall and inconſiderable, I think he cannot be better employed than to repair to the counties where his intereſt lies, to animate the people, promote the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting ſervice, and encourage the militia to come in. He will alſo be able to form a proper judgment of the places ſuit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able for magazines of proviſion to be collected. I have requeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to wait upon Congreſs on this ſubject; and if general Smallwood ſhould go to Maryland on the ſame buſineſs, I think it will have a happy effect: he is popular and of great influence, and, I am perſuaded, would contribute greatly to that ſtate's furniſhing her quota of men in a little time. He is now in Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia.</p>

                  <p>ABOUT one o'clock to-day I received a letter from general Sullivan, a copy of which you have incloſed. I will not comment on the melancholy intelligence which it contains, only adding that I ſincerely regret general Lee's unhappy fate, and feel much for the loſs of my country in his captivity.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect to the enemy, they have been induſtrious in their attempts to procure boats and ſmall craft: but as yet their ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts have not ſucceeded. From the lateſt advices that I have of their movements by ſome priſoners and others, they appear to be leaving Trenton, and to be filing off towards Princeton and Allentown. What their deſigns are, whether they mean to retreat, or only a feint, cannot be determined. I have par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties out to watch their motions, and to form if poſſible, an accurate opinion of their plans.</p>
                  <p>Our force, ſince my laſt, has received no augmentation,—of courſe, by ſickneſs and other cauſes, has diminiſhed: but I am adviſed by a letter from the council of ſafety, which juſt came to hand, that colonels Burd and Gilbreath are marching with their battalions of militia, and alſo that ſome ſmall parties are aſſembling in Cumberland county.</p>

                  <p>IN a letter which I had the honor of addreſſing you, I took the liberty to recommend that more battalions ſhould be raiſed for the new army than what had been voted. Having fully conſidered the matter, I am more and more convinced not only of the propriety but of the neceſſity of the meaſure. That the enemy will leave nothing uneſſayed in the courſe of the next campaign to reduce theſe ſtates to the rule of the moſt * * *, muſt be obvious to every one; and that the militia is not to be depended on, or aid expected from them but in caſes of the moſt preſſing emergency, is not to be doubted. The firſt of theſe propoſitions is unqueſtionable, and fatal experience has given her ſanction to the truth of the latter: indeed their le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy of late, and backwardneſs to turn out at this alarming criſis, ſeem to juſtify an apprehenſion that nothing can bring them from their homes. For want of their aſſiſtance, a large part of Jerſey has been expoſed to ravage and to plunder; nor do I know that Pennſylvania would ſhare a better fate, could general
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:031423_0282_0FEC5BBEB7524EC8"/>
Howe effect a paſſage acroſs the Delaware with a reſpectable force. Theſe conſiderations have induced me to wiſh that no reliance, except ſuch as may ariſe from neceſſity, ſhould ever be had in them again; and to make further mention to Congreſs of the expediency of increaſing their army.—I truſt the meaſures will meet the earlieſt attention.</p>
                  <p>Had I leiſure and were it neceſſary, I could ſay much upon this head: but, as I have not, and the matter is well underſtood I will not add much. By augmenting the number of your battali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, you will augment your force: the officers of each will have their intereſt and influence; and, upon the whole, their numbers will be much greater, though they ſhould not be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete. Added to this, from the preſent confuſed ſtate of Jerſey, and the improper appointment of officers in many inſtances, I have little or no expectation that ſhe will be able to raiſe all the troops exacted from her, though I think it might be done, were ſuitable ſpirited gentlemen commiſſioned, who would exert themſelves, and encourage the people, many of whom (for a failure in this inſtance, and who are well diſpoſed) are making their ſubmiſſions.—In a word, the next will be a trying campaign: and as all that is dear and valuable may depend upon the iſſue of it, I would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſe that nothing ſhould be omitted, that ſhall ſeem neceſſary to our ſucceſs. Let us have a reſpectable army, and ſuch as will be competent to every exigency.</p>
                  <p>I will alſo add that the critical ſituation of our affairs, and the diſſolution of our preſent force (now at hand), require that every nerve and exertion be employed for recruiting the new battalions. One part of general Howe's movements at this time, I believe, is with a deſign to diſtract us and prevent this buſineſs. If the inclemency of the weather ſhould force him into winter quarters, he will not remain there longer than ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity ſhall oblige him: he will commence his operations in a ſhort ſpace of time: and in that time our levies muſt be made up, to oppoſe him, or I fear the moſt melancholy of all events muſt take place.</p>
                  <p>The incloſed extract of a letter from the commiſſary-general will ſhew his demands for money, and his plans for procuring ſalted proviſions and a quantity of flour from the ſouthward. The whole is ſubmitted to the conſideration of Congreſs: and I wiſh the reſult of their opinion to be tranſmitted him, with ſuch ſupplies of money as may be neceſſary for himſelf and the departments he mentions.</p>
                  <p>The clothing of the troops is a matter of infinite importance, and, if it could be accompliſhed, would have a happy effect.

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I HAVE waited with much impatience to know the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations of Congreſs on the propoſitions made ſome time in October laſt for augmenting our corps of artillery and eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhing a corps of engineers. The time is come when the firſt cannot be delayed without the greateſt injury to the ſafety of theſe ſtates; and therefore, under the reſolution of Congreſs bearing date the twelfth inſtant, at the repeated inſtances of colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Knox, and by the preſſing advice of all the general officers now here, I have ventured to order three battalions of artillery to be immediately recruited. Theſe are two leſs than colonel Knox re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commends, as you will ſee by his plan incloſed: but then this ſcheme comprehends all the United States, whereas ſome of the ſtates have corps already eſtabliſhed, and theſe three battalions are indiſpenſably neceſſary for the operations in this quarter, including the northern department.</p>
                  <p>The pay of our artilleriſts bearing no proportion with that in the Engliſh or French ſervice,—the murmuring and diſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion thereby occaſioned, and the abſolute impoſſibility (as I am told) of getting them upon the old terms,—and the unavoidable neceſſity of obtaining them at all events,—have induced me (alſo by advice) to promiſe officers and men that their pay ſhould be augmented twenty-five per cent, or that their engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhould become null and void. This may appear to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs premature and unwarrantable. But, ſir, if they view our ſituation in the light it ſtrikes their officers, they will be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the utility of the meaſure, and that the execution could not be delayed till after their meeting at Baltimore. In ſhort, the preſent exigency of our affairs will not admit of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay either in council or the field: for well convinced I am, that if the enemy go into quarters at all, it will be for a ſhort ſeaſon. But I rather think the deſign of general Howe is to poſſeſs him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of Philadelphia this winter if poſſible; and in truth I do not ſee what is to prevent him, as ten days more will put an end
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:031423_0284_0FEC5BC4046F5488"/>
to the exiſtence of our army. That one great point is to keep us as much harraſſed as poſſible, with a view to injure the recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſervice and hinder a collection of ſtores and other neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaries for the next campaign, I am as clear in, as I am of my exiſtence. If therefore, [<hi>when</hi>] we have to provide this ſhort interval, and make theſe great and ardent preparations,—every matter that in its nature is ſelf-evident is to be referred to Congreſs at the diſtance of a hundred and thirty or forty miles, ſo much time muſt neceſſarily elapſe, as to defeat the end in view.</p>
                  <p>It may be ſaid that this is an application for powers that are too dangerous to be entruſted. I can only add that deſperate diſeaſes require deſperate remedies; and with truth declare that I have no luſt after power, but wiſh with as much fervency as any man upon this wide-extended continent, for an oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of turning the ſword into a plough-ſhare. But my feelings, as an officer and a man, have been ſuch as to force me to ſay that no perſon ever had a greater choice of difficulties to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with than I have.—It is needleſs to add, that ſhort enliſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and a miſtaken dependence upon militia, have been the origin of all our misfortunes and the great accumulation of our debt.</p>
                  <p>We find, ſir, that the enemy are daily gathering ſtrength from the diſſaffected. This ſtrength, like a ſnow-ball, by rolling, will increaſe, unleſs ſome means can be deviſed to check effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually the progreſs of the enemy's arms. Militia may poſſibly do it for a little while: but in a little while alſo, the militia of thoſe ſtates which have been frequently called upon will not turn out at all; or, if they do, it will be with ſo much reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance and ſloth, as to amount to the ſame thing:—inſtance, New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Jerſey!—witneſs Pennſylvania!—Could any thing but the river Delaware have ſaved Philadelphia?—Can any thing (the exige<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap> of the caſe indeed may juſtify it) be more deſtructive to the recr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                        <desc>•••</desc>
                     </gap>
                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſervice, than giving ten dollars bounty for ſix weeks' ſervice of the militia, who come in, you cannot tell how,—go, you can not tell when,—and act, you cannot tell where—conſume you<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> proviſions, exhauſt your ſtores, and leave you at laſt at a criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal moment?</p>
                  <p>Theſe, ſir, are the men I am to depend upon, ten days hence: this is the baſis on which your cauſe will and muſt forever de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend, till you get a large ſtanding army ſufficient of itſelf to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the enemy. I therefore beg leave to give it as my hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble opinion, that eighty-eight battalions are by no means equal to the oppoſition you can make, and that a moment's time is not
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:031423_0285_0FEC5BC7A102DDE0"/>
to be loſt in raiſing a greater number,—not leſs in my opinion and the opinion of my officers, than a hundred and ten. It may be urged that it will be found difficult enough to complete the firſt number. This may be true, and yet the officers of a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and ten battalions will recruit a great many more men, than thoſe of eighty-eight. In my judgment this is not a time to ſtand upon expence: our funds are the only object of conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration. The ſtate of New-York have added one battalion (I wiſh they had made it two) to their quota.—If any good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers offer to raiſe men upon continental pay and eſtabliſhment in this quarter, I ſhall encourage them to do ſo, and regiment them when they have done it. If Congreſs diſapprove of this proceeding, they will pleaſe to ſignify it, as I mean it for the beſt.</p>
                  <p>It may be thought that I am going a good deal out of the line of my duty, to adopt theſe meaſures, or to adviſe thus free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. A character to loſe,—an eſtate to forfeit,—the ineſtimable bleſſings of liberty at ſtake,—and a life devoted,—muſt be my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſe.</p>
                  <p>I have heard nothing of the light-horſe from Virginia, nor the regiment from the Eaſtern-Shore. I wiſh to know what troops are to act in the different departments, and to have thoſe from the ſouthward (deſigned for this place) ordered on as faſt as they ſhall be raiſed. The route ſhould be pointed out by which they are to march; aſſiſtant-commiſſaries and quarter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maſters upon the communication, to ſupply their wants: the firſt or ſecond officer of each battalion to forward them, and the other to come on, receive and form them at their place of deſtination. Unleſs this is immediately ſet about, the campaign, if it ſhould be cloſed, will be opened in the ſpring before we have any men in the field.</p>
                  <p>Every exertion ſhould be uſed to procure tents: a clothier-general ſhould be appointed without loſs of time, for ſupplying the army with every article in that way:—he ſhould be a man of buſineſs and abilities. A commiſſary of priſoners muſt be appointed to attend the army:—for want of an officer of this kind, the exchange of priſoners has been conducted in a ſhame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and injurious manner. We have had them from all quarters puſhed into our camps at the moſt critical junctures, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt previous notice. We have had them travelling through the different ſtates in all directions by certificates from committees, without any kind of controul; and have had inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of ſome going into the enemy's camp without my privity or knowledge, after paſſing in the manner before mentioned.—
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:031423_0286_0FEC5BCA117F5EC0"/>
There may be other officers neceſſary which I do not recollect at this time, and which, when thought of, muſt be provided: for this, ſir, you may rely on, that the commanding officer, under the preſent eſtabliſhment, is obliged to attend to the buſineſs of ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny different departments, as to render it impoſſible to conduct that of his own with the attention neceſſary;—than which, nothing can be more injurious.</p>
                  <p>In a former letter, I intimated my opinion of the neceſſity of having a brigadier for every three regiments, and a major gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to every three brigades, at moſt. I think no time is to be loſt in making the appointments, that the arrangements may be conſequent. This will not aid the recruiting ſervice, but will be the readieſt means of forming and diſciplining the army afterwards, which, in the ſhort time we have to do it, is of amazing conſequence. I have labored ever ſince I have been in the ſervice, to diſcourage all kinds of local attachments and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinctions of country, denominating the whole by the greater name of '<hi>American:</hi>' but I found it impoſſible to overcome prejudices: and, under the new eſtabliſhment, I conceive it beſt to ſtir up an emulation; in order to do which, would it not be bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter for each ſtate to furniſh (though not to appoint) their own brig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adiers?—This, if known to be part of the eſtabliſhment, might prevent a good deal of contention and jealouſy; and would, I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, be the means of promotions going forward with more ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, and quiet the higher officers.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt I am ſpeaking of promotions, I cannot help giving it as my opinion, that, if Congreſs think proper to confirm what I have done with reſpect to the corps of artillery, colonel Knox (at preſent at the head of that department, but who, without promotion, will reſign) ought to be appointed to the command of it, with the rank and pay of brigadier. I have alſo to mention, that, for want of ſome eſtabliſhment in the department of engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers agreeable to the plan laid before Congreſs in October laſt, colonel Putnam, who was at the head of it, has quitted, and taken a regiment in the ſtate of Maſſachuſetts. I know of no other man tolerable well qualified for the conducting of that buſineſs. None of the French gentlemen whom I have ſeen with appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in that way appear to me to know any thing of the matter. There is one in Philadelphia, who I am told, is clever: but him I have never ſeen.</p>
                  <p>I muſt alſo once more beg leave to mention to Congreſs the expediency of letting promotions be in a regimental line. The want of this has already driven ſome of the beſt officers that were in your army, out of the ſervice. From repeated and
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:031423_0287_0FEC5BCC419067E8"/>
ſtrict enquiry I am convinced you can adopt no mode of promotion that will be better received, or that will give more general ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I wiſh therefore to have it announced.</p>
                  <p>The caſting of cannon is a matter that ought not to be one mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment delayed: and therefore I ſhall ſend colonel Knox to put this in a train, as alſo to have travelling carriages and ſhot provided,—elaboratories to be eſtabliſhed, one in Hart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford, and another in York. Magazines of proviſions ſhould al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo be laid in. Theſe I ſhall fix with the commiſſary. As our great loſs laſt year proceeded from a want of teams, I ſhall di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect the quarter-maſter-general to furniſh a certain number to each regiment to anſwer the common purpoſes thereof, that the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my may be enabled to remove from place to place differently from what we have done, or could do, this campaign. Ammu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nition carts, and proper carts for entrenching tools, ſhould alſo be provided, and I ſhall direct about them accordingly. Above all a ſtore of ſmall arms ſhould be provided, or men will be of little uſe. The conſumption and waſte of theſe, this year, has been great:—militia, flying-camp men, &amp;c. coming in without, were obliged to be furniſhed, or become uſeleſs. Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of theſe threw their arms away: ſome loſt them, whilſt others deſerted, and took them away. In a word, although I uſed every precaution to preſerve them, the loſs has been great; and this will forever be the caſe in ſuch a mixed and irregular army as ours has been.</p>
                  <p>If no part of the troops already embarked at New-York has appeared in Virginia, their deſtination doubtleſs muſt be to ſome other quarter; and that ſtate muſt, I ſhould think be freed from any invaſion, if general Howe can be effectually oppoſed in this. I therefore incloſe a memorandum given me by brigadier Stephen of Virginia, which Congreſs will pleaſe to adopt in the whole,—in part,—or reject,—as may be conſiſtent with their plans and intelligence.</p>
                  <p>The diviſion of the army, late under the command of general Lee, now general Sullivan, is juſt upon the point of joining us. A ſtrange kind of fatality has attended it. They had orders on the ſeventeenth of November to join, now more than a month. General Gates, with four eaſtern regiments, is alſo near at hand: three others from thoſe ſtates were coming on, by his order, by the way of Peekſkill, and had joined general Heath whom I had ordered on with Parſon's brigade, to join me, leaving Clinton's brigade and ſome militia (that were at Forts Montgomery and Conſtitution) to guard thoſe important paſſes of the Highlands. But the convention of the ſtate of
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:031423_0288_0FEC5BD3F60DC0D8"/>
New-York ſeeming to be much alarmed at Heath's coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way,—a fleet appearing off New-London,—and ſome part of the enemy's troops retiring towards Brunſwic,—induced me to countermand the order for the march of Parſons's brigade, and to direct the three regiments from Tyconderoga to halt at Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſtown in Jerſey (where I underſtand about eight hundred militia had collected), in order to inſpirit the inhabitants, and, as far as poſſible, cover that part of the country. I ſhall ſend general Maxwell this day to take the command of them, and, if to be done, to harraſs and annoy the enemy in their quarters, and cut off their convoys.</p>
                  <p>The care and vigilance, which were uſed in ſecuring the boats on this river, have hitherto baffled every attempt of the enemy to croſs: but, from concurring reports and appearances, they are waiting for ice to afford them a paſſage.</p>
                  <p>Since writing the foregoing, I have received a letter from gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernor Cooke of Rhode-Iſland, of which the incloſed is a copy. Previous to this, and immediately upon the firſt intelligence ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained of a fleet's going through the Sound, I diſpatched orders to generals Spencer and Arnold to proceed without the leaſt delay to the eaſtward. The firſt, I preſume, is gone: the latter, not get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting my letter till he came to a place called Eaſton, was, by advice of general Gates, who alſo met my letter at the ſame place, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced to come on hither before he proceeded to the eaſtward.—Moſt of our brigadiers are laid up: not one has come on with the diviſion under general Sullivan, but they are left ſick at different places on the road.</p>
                  <p>By accounts from the eaſtward, a large body of men had aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in Rhode-Iſland, from the ſtates of Maſſacuſetts and Connecticut. I preſume (but I have no advice of it) that the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia ordered from the firſt, to rendezvous at Danbury (ſix thouſand in number) under the command of major-general Lincoln, for ſupplying the place of the diſbanded men of that ſtate in the continental army, will now be ordered to Rhode-Iſland.</p>
                  <p>In ſpeaking of general Lincoln, I ſhould not do him juſtice, were I not to add that he is a gentleman well worthy of notice in the military line. He commanded the militia from Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts laſt ſummer, or fall rather, and much to my ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,—having proved himſelf on all occaſions an active, ſpirited, ſenſible man. I do not know whether it his wiſh to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main in the military line, or whether, if he ſhould, any thing under the rank he now holds in the ſtate he comes from would ſatisfy him. How far an appointment of this kind might offend
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:031423_0289_0FEC5BD585CDD700"/>
the continental brigadiers, I cannot undertake to ſay:—many there are, over whom he ought not to be placed; but I know of no way to diſcriminate.—Brigadier Reed of New-Hamſhire does not, I preſume, mean to continue in ſervice: he ought not,—as I am told, by the ſeverity of the ſmall-pox, he is become both blind and deaf.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>THAT I ſhould dwell upon the ſubject of our diſtreſſes, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be more diſagreeable to Congreſs than it is painful to myſelf. The alarming ſituation to which our affairs are reduced, impels me to the meaſure. Inquiry and inveſtigation,—which in moſt caſes ſerve to develope and point out a remedy,—in ours, preſent more and greater difficulties. Till of late I was led to hope from report that no inconſiderable part of the troops compoſing the regiments that were with general Lee, and thoſe from Tyconderogo under general Gates, had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſted again. This intelligence, I confeſs, gave me reaſon to expect that I ſhould have at the expiration of the preſent year, a force ſomewhat more reſpectable than what I find will be the caſe.</p>
                  <p>Having examined into the ſtate of thoſe regiments, I am au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed to ſay, from the information of their officers, that but ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few of the men have enliſted. Thoſe who have, are of the troops from Tyconderoga, and were permitted to viſit their friends and homes, as part of the terms on which they would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage. In reſpect to thoſe who marched with general Lee, I cannot learn that any have. Their refuſal, I am told, has not proceeded more from an averſion to the ſervice, or any fixed determination not to engage again, than from their wiſhes to return home,—the non-appointment of officers in ſome in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances,—the turning out of good, and appointing of bad,—in others, and the incomplete or rather no arrangement of them,—a work unhappily committed to the management of their ſtates: nor have I the moſt diſtant proſpect of retaining them
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:031423_0290_0FEC5BD712F95878"/>
a moment longer than the laſt of this inſtant, notwithſtanding the moſt preſſing ſolicitations and the obvious neceſſity for it.</p>
                  <p>By the departure of theſe regiments I ſhall be left with five from Virginia, Smallwood's from Maryland, a ſmall part of Rawlin's, Hand's from Pennſylvania, a part of Ward's from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, and the German battalion, amounting in the whole at this time from fourteen to fifteen hundred effective men. This handful, and ſuch militia as may chuſe to join me, will then com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe our army.</p>
                  <p>When I reflect upon theſe things they fill me with much concern, knowing that general Howe has a number of troops can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toned in the towns bordering on and near the Delaware,—his intentions to paſs, as ſoon as the ice is ſufficiently formed, to invade Pennſylvania and to poſſeſs himſelf of Philadelphia, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. To guard againſt his deſigns and the execution of them, ſhall employ my every exertion: but how is this to be done? As yet but few militia have gone to Philadelphia, and they are to be our ſupport at this alarming criſis. Had I enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a doubt of general Howe's intentions to paſs the Delaware on the diſſolution of our army, and as ſoon as the ice is made, it would now be done away. An intercepted letter from a gentleman of Philadelphia, (who has joined the enemy), to his friend and partner in the city, declares that to be their deſign,—that the army would be there in ten or twenty days from the ſix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth inſtant, the time of his writing, if the ice ſhould be made;—adviſes him by no means to remove their ſtores,—that they would be ſafe.</p>
                  <p>The obſtacles which have ariſen to the raiſing of the new army, from the mode of appointing the officers, induce me to hope, if Congreſs reſolve on an additional number of battalions to thoſe already voted, that they will deviſe ſome other rule by which the officers, eſpecially the field-officers, ſhould be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed. In caſe an augmentation ſhould be made to the eaſtern regiments, a deviation from the former mode will operate more ſtrongly as to them than to other battalions, becauſe there have been many more officers in ſervice from thoſe ſtates, than the regiments voted to be raiſed would admit of; by which means ſeveral deſerving men could not have been provided for, had the utmoſt pains been uſed for the purpoſe; and many others of merit have been neglected in the late appointments, and thoſe of little worth and leſs experience put in their places or promoted over their heads. This has been the caſe with many of the beſt officers.</p>
                  <p>The incloſed letter from the paymaſter-general will ſhew
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:031423_0291_0FEC5BD9133D1838"/>
the ſtate of the military cheſt, and the neceſſity of a large and immediate ſupply of caſh. The advances to the officers, for bounty and the recruiting ſervice, are great: beſides, the regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, at the expiration of this month, will require pay of their claims. * * *</p>

                  <p>I HAVE your obliging favors of the twenty-firſt and twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-third. The blankets are come to hand; but I would not have any of the other goods ſent on till you hear again from me.</p>
                  <p>I agree with you that it is vain to ruminate upon, or even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon the authors or cauſes of, our preſent misfortunes: we ſhould rather exert ourſelves, and look forward with hopes that ſome lucky chance may yet turn up in our favor. Bad as our proſpects are, I ſhould not have the leaſt doubt of ſucceſs in the end, did not the late treachery and defection of thoſe, who ſtood foremoſt in the oppoſition while fortune ſmiled up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us, make me fearful that many more will follow their example, who, by uſing their influence with ſome and working upon the fears of others, may extend the circle ſo as to take in whole towns, counties, nay, provinces. Of this we have a recent inſtance in Jerſey; and I wiſh many parts in Pennſylvania may not be rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to receive the yoke.</p>
                  <p>The ſecurity of the continental ſhips of war in Delaware is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a capital object; and yet to draught the many hands, neceſſary to fit them out, from the militia, might be dangerous juſt now: perhaps in a little time hence their places may be ſupplied with country militia; and then, if the exigency of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs requires it, they certainly ought to be ſpared.—I will juſt hint to you a propoſition that was made, or rather talked of, a few days ago by the officers of two New-England regiments whoſe time of ſervice will expire on the firſt of January. They
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:031423_0292_0FEC47943144D2D0"/>
are moſt of them water-men: and they ſay their men would willingly go on board the frigates, and navigate them round to any of the ports in New-England, if it was thought they would be ſafer there than in Delaware. You may think of this, and let me hear from you on the ſubject, if the propoſition pleaſes you.</p>
                  <p>Lieutenant Roger of the navy is already gone in, and I have made a demand of lieutenant Joſiah in exchange; but I have not heard whether Lord Howe accedes to it. I will procure the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe of doctor Hodge as ſoon as it can be done without injuring others by giving him the preference, as I have always made it a rule to demand thoſe firſt who have been longeſt in captivity. I will take the ſame ſteps in regard to Mr. Jones, commander of the ſloop taken by the Andrew Doria.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall take the earlieſt opportunity of ſending in your letter to general Lee, with the bill drawn upon major Small.</p>
                  <p>From an intercepted letter from a perſon in the ſecrets of the enemy, I find their intentions are to croſs Delaware as ſoon as the ice is ſufficiently ſtrong. I mention this, that you may take the neceſſary ſteps for the ſecurity of ſuch public and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate property as ought not to fall into their hands, ſhould they make themſelves maſters of Philadelphia, of which they do not ſeem to entertain the leaſt doubt.</p>
                  <p>I hope the next chriſtmas will prove happier than the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, to you, and to, dear ſir, your ſincere friend and humble ſervant,</p>

                  <p>I HAVE the pleaſure of congratulating you upon the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of an enterpriſe which I had formed againſt a detachment of the enemy lying in Trenton, and which was executed yeſterday morning.</p>
                  <p>The evening of the twenty-fifth I ordered the troops intended for this purpoſe to parade back of M'Konkey's ferry, that they might begin to paſs as ſoon as it grew dark, imagining that we ſhould be able to throw them all over, with the neceſſary artillery, by twelve o'clock, and that we might eaſily arrive at Trenton by five in the morning, the diſtance being about nine miles. But the quantity of ice, made that night, impeded the paſſage of the

boats <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o much, that it was three o'clock before the artillery could be all got over; and near four, before the troops took up their line of march.</p>
                  <p>This made me deſpair of ſurpriſing the town, as I well knew we could not reach it before the day was fairly broke. But as I was certain there was no making a retreat without being diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, and harraſſed on repaſſing the river, I determined to puſh on at all events. I formed my detachment in two diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, one to march by the lower or river road, the other by the upper or Pennington road. As the diviſions had nearly the ſame diſtance to march, I ordered each of them, immediately upon forcing the out guards, to puſh directly into the town, that they might charge the enemy before they had time to form.</p>
                  <p>The upper diviſion arrived at the enemy's advanced poſt exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at eight o'clock; and in three minutes after, I found, from the fire on the lower road, that that diviſion had alſo got up. The out guards made but ſmall oppoſition, though for their numbers, they behaved very well, keeping up a conſtant retreat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fire from behind houſes. We preſently ſaw their main body formed; but from their motions, they ſeemed undetermined how to act.</p>
                  <p>Being hard preſſed by our troops who had already got poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of their artillery, they attempted to file off by a road on their right, leading to Princeton. But perceiving their inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I threw a body of troops in their way; which immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly checked them. Finding from our diſpoſition, that they were ſurrounded, and that they muſt inevitably be cut to pieces if they made any further reſiſtance, they agreed to lay down their arms. The number that ſubmitted in this manner was twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>three officers and eight hundred and eighty-ſix men. Colonel Rahl the commanding officer, and ſeven others, were found wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the town. I do not exactly know how many they had kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; but I faney, not above twenty or thirty, as they never made any regular ſtand. Our loſs is very trifling indeed—only two officers and one or two privates wounded.</p>
                  <p>I find that the detachment of the enemy conſiſted of the three Heſſian regiments of Lanſpach, Kniphauſen, and Rhal, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to about fifteen hundred men, and a troop of Britiſh light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horſe: but, immediately upon the beginning of the attack, all thoſe who were not killed or taken, puſhed directly down the road towards Bordentown. Theſe would likewiſe have fallen into our hands, could my plan have been completely carried in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to execution. General Ewing was to have croſſed before day
<pb n="295" facs="unknown:031423_0294_0FEC5BE74E605028"/>
at Trenton ferry, and taken poſſeſſion of the bridge leading out of town: but the quantity of ice was ſo great, that, though he did every thing in his power to effect it, he could not get over. This difficulty alſo hindered general Cadwallader from croſſing with the Pennſylvania militia from Briſtol. He got part of his foot over: but finding it impoſſible to embark his artillery, he was obliged to deſiſt.</p>
                  <p>I am fully confident, that, could the troops under generals Ew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Cadwallader have paſſed the river, I ſhould have been able with their aſſiſtance to have driven the enemy from all their poſts below Trenton. But the numbers I had with me being inferior to theirs below me, and a ſtrong battalion of light infantry being at Princeton above me, I thought it moſt pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to return the ſame evening with the priſoners and the artille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry we had taken. We found no ſtores of any conſequence in the town.</p>
                  <p>In juſtice to the officers and men, I muſt add that their beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vior upon this occaſion, reflects the higheſt honor upon them. The difficulty in paſſing the river in a very ſevere night, and their march through a violent ſtorm of ſnow and hail, did not in the leaſt abate their ardor: but when they came to the charge, each ſeemed to vie with the other in preſſing forward: and were I to give a preference to any particular corps, I ſhould do great injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice to the others.</p>
                  <p>Colonel Baylor, my firſt aid-de-camp, will have the honor of delivering this to you; and from him you may be made acquainted with many other particulars. His ſpirited behavior up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on every occaſion requires me to recommend him to your particular notice.</p>

                  <p>I AM juſt ſetting out to attempt a ſecond paſſage over the Delaware with the troops that were with me on the morning of the twenty-ſixth. I am determined to effect it if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; but know that it will be attended with much fatigue and dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty on account of the ice, which will neither allow us to croſs on foot, nor give us an eaſy paſſage with boats. General Cadwallader croſſed from Briſtol on the twenty-ſeventh, and, by his letter of yeſterday, was at Bordentown with about eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen
<pb n="296" facs="unknown:031423_0295_0FEC5BE8D71BD908"/>
hundred men. In addition to theſe, general Mifflin ſent over five hundred from Philadelphia on friday, three hundred yeſterday evening from Burlington, and will follow to-day with ſeven or eight hundred more. I have taken every precaution in my power for ſubſiſting the troops, and ſhall, without loſs of time, and as ſoon as circumſtances will admit of it, purſue the enemy in their retreat,—try to beat up more of their quarters, and, in a word, in every inſtance, adopt ſuch meaſures as the exigency of our affairs requires, and our ſituation will juſtify.</p>
                  <p>Had it not been for the unhappy failure of generals Ewing and Cadwallader in their attempts to paſs on the night of the twenty-fifth,—and if the ſeveral concerted attacks could have been made,—I have no doubt but that our views would have ſucceeded to our warmeſt expectations. What was done occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned the enemy to leave their ſeveral poſts on the Delaware with great precipitation. The peculiar diſtreſſes to which the troops who were with me were reduced by the ſeverities of cold, rain, ſnow, and ſtorm,—the charge of the priſoners they had taken,—and another reaſon that might me mentioned,—and the little proſpect of receiving ſuccours on account of the ſeaſon and ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the river,—would not authoriſe a further purſuit at that time.</p>
                  <p>Since tranſmitting the liſt of priſoners, a few more have been diſcovered and taken in Trenton,—among them a lieutenant-colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel, and a deputy-adjutant-general,—the whole amounting to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a thouſand.</p>
                  <p>I have been honored with your letter of the twenty-third and its ſeveral incloſures, to which I ſhall pay due attention.—A flag goes in this morning with a letter to general Howe, and another to general Lee. For the latter, Robert Morris, eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire has tranſmitted a bill of exchange, drawn by two Britiſh officers, for a hundred and ſixteen pounds, nine ſhillings, and three pence, on major Small, for money furniſhed them in South-Carolina, which I truſt will be paid. This ſupply is excluſive of the ſum you have reſolved to be ſent him, and which Mr. Morris will procure in time.</p>

                     </gap> till yeſterday, owing to the ice which rendered their paſſage extremely difficult and fatiguing. Since their arrival, we have been parading the regiments whoſe time of ſervice is now expired, in order to know what force we ſhould have to depend on, and how to regulate our views ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly. After much perſuaſion and the exertions of their officers, half or a greater proportion of thoſe from the eaſtward have conſented to ſtay ſix weeks on a bounty of ten dollars. I feel the inconvenience of this advance, and I know the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences which will reſult from it:—but what could be done?—
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:031423_0298_0FEC5C36919BA508"/>
Pennſylvania had allowed the ſame to her militia:—the troops felt their importance, and would have their price. Indeed, as their aid is ſo eſſential, and not to be diſpenſed with, it is to be wondered they had not eſtimated it at a higher rate. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Congreſs, apprehenſive of this event, had made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitted proviſion for it.</p>
                  <p>General Mifflin is at Bordentown with about eighteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, and general Cadwallader at Croſwix's, with about the ſame number.—We are now making our arrangements, and concerting a plan of operations, which I ſhall attempt to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute as ſoon as poſſible, and which I hope will be attended with ſome ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>As to the number and ſituation of the enemy, I cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain certain intelligence: but, from the accounts moſt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied on, they have collected the principal part of their force, from Brunſwic and the neighboring poſts, at Princeton, where they are throwing up ſome works. The number there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be from five to ſix thouſand; and it is confidently ſaid they have ſent the chief part of their baggage to Brunſwic. It is added, that general Howe landed at Amboy a day or two ago with a thouſand light troops, and is on his march from thence.</p>
                  <p>I have ſent into different parts of Jerſey, men of influence to ſpirit up the militia, and flatter myſelf that the many injuries they have received will induce ſome to give their aid. If what they have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

                  <p>I HAVE the honor to inform you, that, ſince the date of my laſt from Trenton, I have removed with the army under my
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:031423_0299_0FEC5C3847BE5490"/>
command to this place. The difficulty of croſſing the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware on account of the ice made our paſſage over it tedious, and gave the enemy an opportunity of drawing in their ſeveral cantonments and aſſembling their whole force at Princeton. Their large picquets, advanced towards Trenton,—their great preparations, and ſome intelligence I had received,—added to their knowledge that the firſt of January brought on a diſſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the beſt part of our army,—gave me the ſtrongeſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons to conclude that an attack upon us was meditating.</p>
                  <p>Our ſituation was moſt critical, and our force ſmall. To re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move immediately was again deſtroying every dawn of hope which had begun to revive in the breaſts of the Jerſey militia; and to bring thoſe troops which had firſt croſſed the Delaware and were lying at Croſwix's under general Cadwallader, and thoſe under general Mifflin at Bordentown (amounting in the whole to about three thouſand ſix-hundred), to Trenton, was to bring them to an expoſed place. One or the other however was unavoidable:—the latter was preferred, and they were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to join us at Trenton, which they did, by a night-march, on the firſt inſtant.</p>
                  <p>On the ſecond, according to my expectation, the enemy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to advance upon us; aud, after ſome ſkirmiſhing, the head of their column reached Trenton about four o'clock, whilſt their rear was as far back as Maidenhead. They attempted to paſs Sanpink creek which runs through Trenton, at different places; but, finding the fords guard <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> and kindled their fires.—We were drawn up on the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

                     </gap> which did us but little damage.</p>
                  <p>Having by this time <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

One thing I was certain of,—that it would avoid the appearance of a retreat (which was of courſe,—or to run the hazard of the whole army being cut off)—whilſt we might by a fortunate ſtroke withdraw general Howe from Trenton, and give ſome reputation to our arms.—Happily we ſucceeded.—We found Princeton about ſun-riſe with only three
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:031423_0300_0FEC5BF44A427AE8"/>
regiments and three troops of light-horſe in it, two of which were on their march to Trenton. Theſe three regiments, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially the two firſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> made a galiant reſiſtance, and, in killed, wounded, and priſoners, muſt have loſt five hundred men: up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of one hundred of them were left dead in the field; and, with what I have with me, and what were taken in the purſuit and carried acroſs the Delaware, there are near three hundred priſoners, fourteen of whom are officers, all Britiſh.</p>
                  <p>This piece of good fortune is counterbalanced by the loſs of the brave and worthy general Mercer, colonels Hazlet and Potter, captain Neal of the artillery, captain Fleming who commanded the firſt Virginia regiment, and four or five other valuable officers, who, with about twenty-five or thirty privates were ſlain in the field. Our whole loſs cannot be aſcertained, as many who are in the purſuit of the enemy (who were chaſed three or four miles) are not yet come in.</p>
                  <p>The rear of the enemy's army lying at Maidenhead (not more than five or ſix miles from Princeton) was up with us be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our purſuit was over: but as I had the precaution to deſtroy the bridge over Stoney-brook (about half a mile from the field of action), they were ſo long retarded there as to give us time to move off in good order for this place. We took two braſs field pieces; but for want of horſes could not bring them away. We alſo took ſome blankets, ſhoes, and a few other trif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling articles, burned the hay, and deſtroyed ſuch other things as the ſhortneſs of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

The enemy from the beſt intelligence I have been able to get, were ſo much alarmed at the apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of this, that they marched immediately to Brunſwic without halting, except at the bridges (for I alſo took up thoſe on Mill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, on the different routs to Brunſwic), and got there before day.</p>
                  <p>From the beſt information I have received, general Howe has left no men either at Trenton or Princeton. The truth of this I am endeavoring to aſcertain, that I may regulate my movements accordingly.</p>

The militia are taking ſpirits, and, I am told, are coming in faſt from this ſtate: but I fear thoſe from Philadelphia will ſcarcely ſubmit to the hardſhips of a winter campaign much lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, eſpecially as they very unluckily ſent their blankets with their baggage to Burlington. I muſt do them the juſtice however, to add that they have undergone more fatigue and hardſhip, than I expected militia (eſpecially citizens) would have done at this inclement ſeaſon.—I am juſt moving towards Morriſtown, where I ſhall endeavor to put them under the beſt cover I can:—hitherto we have been without any; and many of our poor ſoldiers barefoot, and ill clad in other re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects.</p>

                  <p>I AM happy to inform you that the account of general Mercer's death, tranſmitted in my laſt, was premature, though it was mentioned as certain by many who ſaw him after he was wounded. By intelligence from Princeton yeſterday evening, he was alive, and ſeemed as if he would do well:—unhappily he is a priſoner. Had it not been for the information I had of his death, I would have tried to have brought him away, though I believe it could not have beeen effected.</p>

                  <p>I Embrace this opportunity, by Mr. Hopkins, of inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you that the enemy remain upon their old ground at Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy and Brunſwic. Our accounts ſtill confirm their want of forage, which I hope will increaſe.—If their horſes are reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this winter, it will be impoſſible for them to take the field in the ſpring.</p>
                  <p>General Warner, with two regiments from Maſſachuſetts, is arrived here: general Heath, with the remainder of the troops from that ſtate, has by this time began to move down towards Kingſbridge.</p>
                  <p>I this day intend to ſend in a flag with letters to lord and general Howe upon the ſubject of general Lee's exchange, and remonſtrating againſt the ſevere treatment of our priſoners. I incloſe you copies of both, for your inſpection and approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE not had the honor of any of your favors ſince I wrote to you on the fourteenth inſtant.—No material altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions have happened in this quarter.—The enemy, from every account, mean to make Brunſwic their advanced poſt for this

Pennſylvania had allowed the ſame to her militia:—the troops felt their importance, and would have their price. Indeed, as their aid is ſo eſſential, and not to be diſpenſed with, it is to be wondered they had not eſtimated it at a higher rate. I per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that Congreſs, apprehenſive of this event, had made un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limitted proviſion for it.</p>
                  <p>General Mifflin is at Bordentown with about eighteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred men, and general Cadwallader at Croſwix's, with about the ſame number.—We are now making our arrangements, and concerting a plan of operations, which I ſhall attempt to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute as ſoon as poſſible, and which I hope will be attended with ſome ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>As to the number and ſituation of the enemy, I cannot ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain certain intelligence: but, from the accounts moſt to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lied on, they have collected the principal part of their force, from Brunſwic and the neighboring poſts, at Princeton, where they are throwing up ſome works. The number there is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported to be from five to ſix thouſand; and it is confidently ſaid they have ſent the chief part of their baggage to Brunſwic. It is added, that general Howe landed at Amboy a day or two ago with a thouſand light troops, and is on his march from thence.</p>
                  <p>I have ſent into different parts of Jerſey, men of influence to ſpirit up the militia, and flatter myſelf that the many injuries they have received will induce ſome to give their aid. If what they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                  <p>I HAVE the honor to inform you, that, ſince the date of my laſt from Trenton, I have removed with the army under my
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031423_0305_0FEC5C01A1A59238"/>
of men, as are colonel Hand's, Smallwood's and the German battalion.—A few days ago general Warner arrived with about ſeven hundred Maſſachuſetts militia engaged to the fifteenth of March.</p>
                  <p>Thus you have a ſketch of our preſent army, with which we are obliged to keep up appearances before an enemy already double to us in numbers, and who, from every account are withdrawing their troops from Rhode-Iſland, to form a juncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of their whole army, and make another attempt either to break up ours, or penetrate towards Philadelphia,—a thing by no means difficult now, as the ice affords an eaſy paſſage over the Delaware.</p>
                  <p>I do not yet know what effect general Heath's moving down towards New-York will have.—Yeſterday morning a conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able firing was heard, which ſeemed to be about Kingſbridge. I am in hopes that his appearance on that quarter with a pretty large force will oblige them to withdraw part of theirs from Jerſey, to ſecure the city of New-York, which, by late accounts, is weakly garriſoned.—General Heath has all the eaſtern and York militia with him, except the ſmall brigade under general Warner which I mentioned before, one regiment of Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut, ſtopped at Providence in Rhode-Iſland, and a number (how many I do not know) requeſted by general Schuyler to be ſent to Tyconderoga.—If it ſhould appear that they are regardleſs of the diverſion made by general Heath, and preſiſt in their plan of drawing their whole army together in Jerſey, I muſt order him over with all his troops, except as many as are neceſſary to garriſon the forts and guard the paſſes in the Highlands.</p>
                  <p>I have ordered away every officer that could be ſpared,—ſome to recruit, and ſome to collect the ſcattered men of the different regiments, who are diſperſed almoſt over the continent: for, the vaſt numbers ſent to the hoſpitals at different times, few ever returned after they got well.</p>
                  <p>As militia muſt be our dependence till we can get the new army raiſed and properly arranged, I muſt entreat you to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue your endeavours with the ſtate of Pennſylvania, Maryland, and Virginia, to turn out every man they poſſibly can, and for ſome longer time than they have generally ſtipulated for. If they agree for a month or any limitted time, it ſhould com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence from the time they actually join the army, and not from the time they leave their homes: otherwiſe the marching back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and forwards conſumes the term of engagement.</p>
                  <p>I think theſe demands of aid ſhould be made as quietly as the nature of the caſe will admit of, eſpecially at this time
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031423_0306_0FEC5C091C508CE8"/>
when we are deceiving our enemies with falſe opinions of our numbers: for, to boaſt of our ſuperiority in that reſpect on one hand, and to call publicly on the people for aſſiſtance on the other, is an impropriety too glaring:—indeed it has been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready noticed in ſome publications that I have ſeen from New-York.</p>

                  <p>I AM favored with yours of the fifteenth inſtant, with the ſundry reſolves incloſed in it. If that reſpecting the continen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal currency is carried ſtrictly into execution, it cannot fail of ſully re-eſtabliſhing its credit.</p>
                  <p>I have no objection to the three gentlemen who are recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended for field-officers in the new Hampſhire regiment: they ſeem fully entitled to it, as they have raiſed the regiment. I will furniſh them with commiſſions from the date of their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, when applied to for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>There is ſomething particular in the application of colonel Dubois and his officers for the ſum of five hundred and thirteen dollars and two-thirds. They have been commiſſioned provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they ſhould raiſe the men; but, from their own pay-abſtract, it appears that fourteen officers only brought twenty-five men into the field. As they certainly did not comply with their agreement, I would, after ſtating the matter as it really was, ſubmit it to Congreſs who have the diſpoſal of the public money.</p>
                  <p>I have peruſed the petition of monſieur Faneuil and other French gentlemen. If they could raiſe ſuch a regiment as they propoſe, it would certainly be uſeful: but I have no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception that there are Canadians enough to be ſound even for a regiment of the common number, much leſs of two thouſand three hundred and forty-ſeven, which is the number propoſed. I know, neither colonel Livingſton nor colonel Hazen could ever complete their Canadian regiments when they had the country open to them. As I would give encouragement to foreigners of real merit, I would put the thing upon this footing:—if monſieur Faneuil can procure a ſufficient number of officers to fill a regiment of the common ſize, and they can give any aſſurances of being able to raiſe the men I would grant them commiſſions.</p>
                  <p>I would beg leave to remark here, that, except we can throw
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031423_0307_0FEC5C0BCC575128"/>
the many foreigners who have been commiſſioned in our army, into a corps together, they will be entirely uſeleſs, as they can neither converſe with officers nor men in any other kind of regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>I am ſo well aſſured that you would not recommend doctor Potts to ſucceed doctor Stringer in the northern department except you had ſufficient proof of his abilities in the medical line that I readily concur with you in the appointment.</p>
                  <p>I have received a piece of information which I am afraid is true,—and that is, that the Britiſh cruiſers have taken a French veſſel with a large parcel of cannon and mortars on board. I know ſuch a one was expected, and therefore more readily credit the account.</p>

                  <p>MY laſt to you was on the twentieth inſtant. Since that, I have the pleaſure to inform you that general Dickinſon, with about four hundred militia, has defeated a foraging party of the enemy of an equal number, and has taken forty waggons, and upwards of a hundred horſes, moſt of them of the Engliſh draft breed, and a number of ſheep and cattle which they had collected. The enemy retreated with ſo much precipitation, that general Dickinſon had only an opportunity of making nine priſoners. They were obſerved to carry off a good many dead and wounded in light waggons.—This action happened near Somerſet court-houſe on Millſtone river. General Dickinſon's behavior reflects the higheſt honor upon him: for, though his troops were all raw, he led them through the river middle-deep, and gave the enemy ſo ſevere a charge, that, although ſupported by three field-pieces, they gave way, and left their convoy.</p>
                  <p>I have not heard from general Heath, ſince the firing near Kingſbridge laſt ſaturday; which I cannot account for, unleſs the North-river ſhould have been rendered impaſſible by the ice. But the account of his having ſurpriſed and taken Fort-Independence on friday night laſt comes ſo well authenticated by different ways, that I cannot doubt it. It is ſaid that he took four hundred priſoners in that fort, and that he inveſted Fort-Waſhington on ſaturday, which occaſioned the firing.—This is brought out by three of our officers who made their eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cape from New-York on ſunday, and is confirmed by a ſpy who
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031423_0308_0FEC5C4590B9DC40"/>
went into Amboy, who ſays an expreſs had arrived at Amboy from New-York, with an account of the loſs of Fort-Inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence, and calling for a reinforcement to protect the city: in conſequence of which, a number of troops had gone over.—I have ſent in ſpies to Brunſwic and Amboy to know the truth of this: and if it appears that they have weakened themſelves to reinforce New-York, I ſhall probably make ſome attempt upon them, if we have men enough left to do it.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall be glad to know what ſtock of ſmall-arms you at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent have, and what are your expectations ſhortly. The neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity that we have been and are now under, of calling in and arming the militia ſcatters our armory all over the world in a manner: their officers are ſo irregular that they generally ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer their men to carry home every thing that is put into their hands, which is forever loſt to the public. The new-raiſed regiments will call for a great number of arms; and I do not at preſent ſee how they are to be ſupplied.</p>
                  <p>I would again beg leave to recall the attention of Congreſs to the appointment of general officers. I will not ſuppoſe the nomination of them is poſtponed upon a ſaving principle, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the advantage in having proper officers to examine the pay-rolls of their ſeveral regiments, and compare them with the returns of their brigades,—to ſee that the regiments are provided with what is proper, and that no more than a ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency is allowed,—to keep officers to their duty, and not, while the ſpirited officer is encountering all the fatigues and hardſhips of a rigorous campaign, ſuffer a number of others, under vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous frivolous pretences and imaginary ſickneſſes, to enjoy them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at the public expenſe at their own fireſides:—I ſay, if the appointments are withheld upon parſimonious principles, the Congreſs are miſtaken: for I am convinced, that, by the correction of many abuſes which it is impoſſible for me to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to, the public will be benefited in a great degree in the article of expenſe.—But this is not all.—We have a very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle time to do a very great work in. The arranging, providing for, and diſciplining a hundred and odd battalions is not to be accompliſhed in a day; nor is it to be done at all with any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of propriety, when we have once entered upon the active part of a campaign. Theſe duties muſt be branched out, or they will be neglected, and the public injured. Beſides, were the brigadiers appointed, they might be facilitating the recruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſervice; they would have time to get a little acquainted with their brigades, the wants of them, and caſe me of the great weight and burden which I at preſent feel.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="13" facs="unknown:031423_0309_0FEC5BF7C220E818"/>
On whom the choice will or ought to light, I cannot under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take to ſay. In a former letter I took the liberty of ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the conſideration of Congreſs the propriety of appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, out of each ſtate, brigadiers to command the troops of that ſtate,—thinking, as a diſtinction is now fixed, a ſpirit of emula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion might ariſe by this means. At any rate I ſhall take the liberty of recommending general Cadwallader as one of the firſt for the new appointments. I have found him a man of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, a good diſciplinarian, firm in his principles, and of intre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid bravery. I ſhall alſo beg leave to recommend colonel Reed to the command of the horſe, as a perſon, in my opinion, every way qualified: for he is extremely active and enterpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: many ſignal proofs of which he has given this campaign. For the reſt, the members of Congreſs can judge better than I can: I can only ſay, that, as the army will probably be divided in the courſe of the next campaign, there ought, in my opini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to be three lieutenant-generals, nine major-generals, and twenty-ſeven brigadiers:—in other words, there ought, at leaſt to be a brigadier to every four regiments, and a major-general to every three brigades.—The lieutenant-generals will, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, be appointed out of the oldeſt major-generals, and the major-generals from the oldeſt brigadiers. Nine brigadiers will then be to nominate.</p>
                  <p>I forgot before this to inform Congreſs, that, including the regiment of light dragoons from Virginia, and colonel Sheldon's to be raiſed in Connecticut, I have only commiſſioned officers for four regiments. I was willing to try how theſe could be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quipped before I put more officers into commiſſion. It is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended we ſhall find difficulty in providing neceſſaries or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven horſes for theſe four regiments: if we ſhould not, I ſhall immediately ſet about the reſidue. Colonel Baylor, colonel Moylan (who, as volunteer has remained conſtantly with the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſince his diſcontinuance in the quarter-maſter's department, and colonel Sheldon, command the three new regiments of light dragoons.</p>
                  <p>The treaſury has been for ſome time empty, and the army has labored under the greateſt inconvenience for the want of money. The recruiting ſervice is particularly injured by this, as many officers are now waiting only for bounty-money. I have alſo complaints from the eaſtward of the want of money to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry on their recruiting ſervice.—If we are not ſupplied with that neceſſary article, all matters muſt be at a ſtand. I muſt there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, beg that, if Mr. Palfrey has not been already ſupplied with a large ſum, it may be done with the utmoſt expedition,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031423_0310_0FEC5BF0159B0568"/>

                  <p>I WAS laſt night honored with yours of the eighteenth inſtant, incloſing a letter from the ſtate of New-York to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. From the particular ſituation of their ſtate in regard to their being totally deprived of commerce, they certainly muſt ſtand in need of the aſſiſtance of the other ſtates to provide them with clothing and every thing neceſſary for the equipment of their forces; and it ever was my intention to allow them a full proportion of the clothing purchaſed to the eaſtward, whenever it came to hand. Little or none of it has reached this army, though in the greateſt want, and expoſed to the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities of a winter campaign.</p>
                  <p>The convention have in one inſtance already provided for themſelves out of the public ſtock by ſtopping and making uſe of twenty-ſix bales of clothing coming on from the eaſtward to the army here. As this was done without conſulting me, I took the liberty of deſiring them not to do the like in future; not that I meant to deprive them of their ſhare, but becauſe it diſappointed me of many articles which I ſtood in immediate want of, and had not provided from other quarters. But you may be aſſured, that, whenever returns are to be made of the whole ſtock of clothing, they ſhall have their proportion, and more than that—allowance for their peculiar ſituation.</p>
                  <p>I am amazed to hear complaints of the hoſpital on the eaſt ſide of Hudſon's-river. Doctor Morgan, with moſt of his mates has been conſtantly there ſince I left it with the main body of the army. It is in vain however to look back upon paſt misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. I will not pretend to point out the cauſes; but I know matters have been ſtrangely conducted in the medical line. I hope your new appointment, when it is made, will make the neceſſary reform in the hoſpital, and that I ſhall not, the next campaign, have my ears, and eyes too, ſhocked with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints and looks of poor creatures periſhing for want of proper care either in the regimental or hoſpital ſurgeons.</p>
                  <p>I agree with the convention in the expediency of obſtructing
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031423_0311_0FEC47EF28288C50"/>
the paſſage of the North-river in ſome, place between the mouth and the Highlands. We have found that our labor and expenſe has been thrown away in endeavoring to do it below, where the channel is amazingly wide and deep: but, from the ſlight view I have had of the river above, I think the paſſage may be eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly obſtructed, and defended by proper fortifications, as the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver is ſo narrow that no veſſel going up could poſſibly eſcape the fire. I am no judge of what can be done towards fitting out the frigates at Poughkeepſie:—that muſt be left to the gentlemen of the marine committee.</p>
                  <p>The hint given by the convention of New-York, of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity and utility of a commiſſary of forage, had ſtruck me be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, and had been mentioned by general Mifflin, whoſe depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of quarter-maſter-general muſt be eaſed of part of the load which is at preſent thrown upon it. He is obliged in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtances to act entirely out of his proper line; and inſtead of being confined to the duty of quarter-maſter-general, is alſo waggon-maſter, and forage-maſter-general,—I have wrote to two perſons that I think qualified to fill the office of waggon-maſter; and I hope one of them will accept.—That of commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary of forage ſhall be attended to.</p>
                  <p>The want of accurate maps of the country which has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to been the ſcene of war has been of great diſadvantage to me. I have in vain endeavored to procure them, and have been o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged to make ſhift with ſuch ſketches as I could trace out from my own obſervation and that of gentlemen around me. I really think, if gentlemen of known character and probity could be employed in making maps (from actual ſurvey) of the roads,—the rivers, and bridges and fords over them,—the mountains, and paſſes through them,—it would be of the greateſt advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.</p>
                  <p>I had, previous to the receipt of your letter, wrote to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Howe, and propoſed the fixing an agent for priſoners at New-York. I have not received an anſwer: but if he accedes to the propoſal, I ſhall appoint Mr. Lewis Pintard.</p>
                  <p>I am ſorry that I am obliged to contradict the report of the taking of Fort-Independence as mentioned in my laſt. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve the evacuation of ſome detached redoubts gave riſe to the report.—I have not heard from general Heath ſince the fourteenth inſtant, which I am amazed at. I am quite in the dark as to his numbers, and what progreſs he has made.</p>
                  <p>On the twenty-third, a party of four hundred of our men, under colonel * * *, fell in with two of the regiments of the enemy, convoying a number of waggons from Brunſwic to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031423_0312_0FEC47B15B27D7E0"/>
Our advanced party under colonel Parker engaged them with great bravery upwards of twenty minutes, during which time the colonel commandant was killed, and the ſecond in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand mortally wounded. The people living near the field of action ſay their killed and wounded were conſiderable. We loſt only two men, who were made priſoners. Had colonel * * * come up with the main body, colonel Parker and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther officers think we ſhould have put them to the rout, as their confuſion was very great and their ground diſadvantageous. I have ordered * * * under arreſt, and ſhall bring him to trial to anſwer for ſo extraordinary a piece of conduct.</p>
                  <p>Reinforcements come up ſo extremely ſlow, that I am afraid I ſhall be left without any men before they arrive. The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my muſt be ignorant of our numbers, or they have not horſes to remove their artillery, or they would not ſuffer us to remain undiſturbed. I have repeatedly wrote to all the recruiting of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, to forward on their men as faſt as they could arm and clothe them: but they are ſo extremely averſe to turning out of comfortable quarters, that I cannot get a man to come near me, though I hear from all parts that the recruiting ſervice goes on with great ſucceſs. It would be well if the board of war, in whoſe department it is, would iſſue orders for all officers to equip and forward their recruits to head-quarters with the greateſt expedition.</p>
                  <p>By a reſolve of Congreſs paſſed ſome time ago, general Schuyler is directed to apply to me for ninety-four tons of powder,—a quantity which it is impoſſible I ſhould have by me, and for which I do not know where to direct him to apply. I could wiſh that returns were made to me of the quantity of powder on hand, and where it is to be found, that I may not be at a loſs at any time of emergency.</p>
                  <p>Since the reſignation of colonel Reed, the important office of adjutant-general has been left unfilled (I mean as to a princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal), and I am much at a loſs how or where to find a perſon in every way capable and proper to execute the office. My inclinations lead me to confer the appointment upon a major Morris: but ample teſtimonials ſhould be produced, and full proof of fidelity ought to be made, before an office of ſo high truſt ſhould be conferred upon a perſon in a manner a ſtranger to me. I only know major Morris from a ſhort perſonal ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, and from report: he never even brought a letter of recommendation to me. From his converſation and from the accounts I have received from others, he is a man of conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble military abilities; and, from his behavior in two inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031423_0313_0FEC5C4E2FB5B308"/>
he is a man of bravery and conduct. His ſtory is ſimply this,—that he left the Britiſh ſervice in diſguſt, upon not receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a promotion to which he was juſtly entitled. Perhaps ſome gentlemen of Congreſs may know more about him, or may be able to make ſuch inquiries as might ſatisfy them as to the ſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and propriety of appointing him. I have no other motive for wiſhing him a preference than that I think him the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt perſon that has come under my notice, provided all mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters before mentioned were cleared up.—I ſhall wait the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of a determination of Congreſs before I proceed further in this appointment; and I wiſh to be favored with their advice as ſpeedily as poſſible; for the remains of the old army is much diſarranged for want of a good adjutant-general, and the forma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the new in a great meaſure depends upon an able officer in that line.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE none of your favors un-anſwered at preſent.—There is ſuch a demand upon me from all quarters for money, which I am unable to anſwer, that I cannot help again preſſing you to ſend on a ſupply. The recruiting ſervice is almoſt at a ſtop here for want of money; and governor Trumbull writes me word that it is totally ſo in Connecticut. He adds that their loan officers cannot proceed in their buſineſs for want of proper check-books and notes: but that, if they were furniſhed with them, they could ſoon take in a ſufficient quantity to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer their purpoſes.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall be glad to be informed whether I have a right to draw warrants upon the loan-officers in the different ſtates.—The ſtates of Connecticut advanced colonel Sheldon, at my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, ten thouſand pounds lawful, to raiſe his regiment of horſe. For their reimburſement they deſired me to give them a draught upon the loan-office: but, not knowing whether I had a right to draw upon that fund, I deferred it till I heard from you.</p>
                  <p>I muſt beg you to write to the aſſemblies of the different ſtates, and inſiſt upon the paſſing a law to inflict a ſevere and heavy penalty upon thoſe who harbor deſerters, knowing them to be ſuch. Our army is ſhamefully reduced by deſertion; and, except the people in the country can be forced to give informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion when deſerters return to their old neighborhoods, we
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031423_0314_0FEC5C5043E6BBC8"/>
ſhall be obliged to detach one half of the army to bring back the other.</p>
                  <p>I have a letter from general Heath, of the twenty-fourth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant. He was at and near Kingſbridge with his army. I do not find that he is likely to do more than to draw the attention of the enemy that way, and to cut them off from forage, of which they are in great want.—The troops had not returned from Rhode-Iſland, by the laſt accounts, but were daily ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected.</p>

                  <p>I AM honored with yours of the twenty-fourth of Janua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, with ſundry reſolves of Congreſs, and a petition of monſieur Pelliſier's incloſed. I am not the proper [<hi>perſon</hi>] to refer the petition to, as I am no judge of his merit as an engineer, having never had an opportunity of ſeeing any of his performances. At any rate I do not ſee the neceſſity of appointing him or any other perſon principal engineer at Ticonderoga: for that would ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude any other, though of ſuperior abilities, from being ſent there. Beſides, as a corps of engineers will in all probability be ſoon eſtabliſhed, monſieur Pelliſier's rank can then be ſettled with more propriety.</p>
                  <p>I forgot to mention in any of my former letters that I had appointed captain Nathaniel Gueſt of Virginia to the command of a regiment to be raiſed upon the frontiers of Virginia and Carolina; and I have directed him, if poſſible, to bring a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany or two of Cherokee Indians. If they can be procured, they will anſwer two valuable purpoſes,—one, as excellent ſcouts, the other that they will be in fact hoſtages, and will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the good behavior of their nation.</p>
                  <p>Major Bland, commandant of the Virginia horſe, has deſired to know whether there is not a neceſſity of giving a bounty and re-enliſting his regiment as continental troops. They were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſted to ſerve in the colony; and the men were with ſome dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty prevailed upon to march hither: but the major thinks they would be entirely reconciled upon receiving the bounty.</p>
                  <p>I received a letter from Mr. Chaſe, deſiring I would appoint proper perſons to make inquiry into and take diſpoſitions con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the behavior of the Britiſh and foreign troops in Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey. This would be an endleſs taſk, as their line of march is
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031423_0315_0FEC5C5209385230"/>
marked with devaſtation, and is a thing of ſuch public notorie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that it demands no further proof.</p>
                  <p>I remonſtrated with general Howe upon the treatment of our wounded at Princeton. You will ſee by the incloſed letter from him, that he diſavows and deteſts the proceeding: but I fear that too much encouragement is given to ſuch barbarous behavior by the Britiſh officers; for, in a late ſkirmiſh, in which ſir William Erſkine commanded, lieutenant Kelly of the fifth Virginia regiment was ſlightly wounded in the thigh; but, before he could get off the field, he was overtaken and murder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in a moſt cruel manner. General Stephen informed me that he would write to ſir William, and inform him, that, unleſs ſuch practices were put a ſtop to, our ſoldiers would not be reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from making retaliation.</p>
                  <p>By a letter from general Heath, of the thirtieth of laſt month, I find that he had decamped from the neighborhood of Kingſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridge, and removed back towards the White-Plains. His rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons for doing ſo were that the troops could not ſtand the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clemency of the weather, and that he feared the troops expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from Rhode-Iſland would land upon his back. I have however directed him to leave a body of light troops under an active officer, in order to harraſs their foraging parties, and to cover our own who are to remove as much of the forage from Weſt-Cheſter county as they can: and, after leaving as many men as will ſecure the paſſes in the Highlands, the remainder are to be ſent over here to join me; for I am apprehenſive that the enemy are reinforcing themſelves at Brunſwic.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall to-morrow ſend out parties from every quarter, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move all the waggons, horſes, cattle and ſheep, or as many as poſſible, from the neighborhood of the enemy's lines. They are to attend particularly to the horſes: for if we can reduce thoſe that they at preſent have, and can hinder them from get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting freſh ones from the adjacent country it will be impoſſible for them to move their artillery and waggons forward, ſhould they incline to make another puſh towards Philadelphia.</p>
                  <p>I obſerve by your laſt reſolves that the militia of Baltimore, Hartford, and Cecil counties in Maryland, are ordered out and to march this way. Let me entreat you to ſuffer none to go forward to Philadelphia but what are equipped with arms, accoutrements and blankets: they hurt the ſervice much by taking thoſe things only for a ſhort time from the continental troops, many of whom would otherwiſe be enabled to take the field.</p>
                  <p>The ſecretary of the board of war has tranſmitted me ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031423_0316_0FEC5C5DF7AFC878"/>
of general Schuyler's letters in which he calls preſſingly for ſome general officers to be ſent to his aſſiſtance. This will ſhew you the neceſſity of immediately making the promotions recommended in mine of the twenty ſecond of January: for at preſent I cannot ſpare a general officer from this quarter with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injuring the ſervice.</p>
                  <p>Nothing of conſequence has happened ſince I wrote to you laſt, except a ſkirmiſh on the firſt of this month, five or ſix miles from Brunſwic-landing, between our advanced parties (about ſeven hundred in the whole) and upwards of two thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand of the enemy, under ſir William Erſkine. The heat of the engagement was [<hi>borne by</hi>] colonel Scott of the firſt Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia regiment, who, with about a hundred men, beat back two hundred of the Britiſh grenadiers. Several other officers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved with great ſpirit; but there is ſome reaſon to ſuſpect that colonel * * *, who commanded our main body, did not behave altogether as he ought. I have ordered a court upon him, that the matter may be fairly canvaſſed, and that he may ſtand condemned or acquitted by the evidence of thoſe who were preſent.</p>
                  <p>Colonel * * *, who was under arreſt upon a charge of cow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ardice, broke his parole and went over to Bucks-county, I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with an intent to make his eſcape: but I diſpatched a troop of light-horſe after him, who brought him back yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day: and he is to take his trial on friday.</p>
                  <p>The ſmall-pox has made ſuch head in every quarter, that I find it impoſſible to keep it from ſpreading through the whole army in the natural way. I have therefore determined, not only to inoculate all the troops now here that have not had it, but ſhall order Dr. Shippen to inoculate the recruits as faſt as they come in to Philadelphia. They will loſe no time, becauſe they will go through the diſorder while their clothing, arms and accoutrements are getting ready.</p>
                  <p>From the firſt inſtitution of civil government, it has been the national policy of every precedent ſtate to endeavor to engage its members to the diſcharge of their public duty by the obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of ſome oath: its force and happy influence has been felt in too many inſtances, to need any arguments to ſupport the policy or prove its utility. I have often thought the ſtates have been too negligent in this particular, and am more fully convinced of it from the effect general Howe's excurtion has produced in New-Jerſey.—An oath is the only ſubſtitute that can be adopted to ſupply the defect of principle.—By our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>attention in this article, we loſe a conſiderable cement to our
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031423_0317_0FEC5C0D8890A468"/>
own force, and give the enemy an opportunity to make the firſt tender to the oath of allegiance to the king. Its baneful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence is but too ſeverely felt at this time. The people gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſeſs that they were compelled to take protection, and ſubſcribe the <hi>Declaration:</hi> yet it furniſhes many with argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments to refuſe taking any active part: and further they alledge themſelves bound to a neutrality at leaſt. Many conſcientious people who were well-wiſhers to the cauſe, had they been bound to the ſtates by an oath, would have ſuffered any puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment rather than have taken the oath of allegiance to the king; and are now loſt to our intereſt for want of this neceſſary tie.—Notwithſtanding the obligation of the <hi>Aſſociation,</hi> they do not conceive it to have the ſame effect as an oath.—The more u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited the inhabitants appear, the greater difficulty general Howe will have in reconciling them to regal government, and conſequently the leſs hope of conquering them.—For theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and many more that might be urged, I ſhould ſtrongly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend every ſtate to fix upon ſome oath or affirmation of allegiance to be tendered to all the inhabitants without excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to outlaw thoſe that refuſe it.</p>

                  <p>I WAS yeſterday waited upon by two French gentlemen, monſieur Romand de Liſle, and Robillard. The firſt produced a commiſſion ſigned by you in November laſt, appointing him a major of artillery: but, by the incloſed letter from him to me, he claims much higher rank under the promiſe of Congreſs,—that of commandant of the continental artillery.—Whether any ſuch promiſe was made, I leave you to determine.</p>
                  <p>Robillard claims a captaincy of artillery: but, upon what he grounds his pretentions, I do not know. I never ſaw him but once before; and that was upon his way from Boſton to Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia.</p>

                  <p>SINCE I had the honor of addreſſing you on the fifth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, no event of an important and intereſting nature has oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, unleſs the ſucceſſes of our parties in foraging and bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing off horſes, waggons, and ſome fat cattle and ſheep, which were contiguous to and around the enemy's lines, are conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ſuch. I then mentioned that I had ſuch a ſcheme in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, which was happily accompliſhed the next day with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any loſs. The enemy in turn have made frequent efforts in that way, but with little ſucceſs. Whenever they made the attempt, it never failed to produce a ſkirmiſh. They have been common of late, but with little damage to either ſide.</p>
                  <p>We have certain intelligence that they have drawn the greateſt part of their troops from Rhode-Iſland, and are told that part of them have landed on Staten-Iſland and at Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy, with a view of augmenting their force at Brunſwic.</p>
                  <p>Colonel * * *, agreeable to the information contained in my laſt, has been tried by a court-martial, and caſhiered. The proceedings and ſentence I directed to be tranſmitted to the ſecretary of the war-office, and to the printers of this ſtate and Virginia, to be publiſhed.</p>
                  <p>General Lincoln is juſt arrived with a regiment of Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts militia, about two hundred and fifty. This, he ſays, is ſucceeded by three more, which will make in the whole near eighteen hundred: but in this I think he muſt be miſtaken, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs thoſe on the march are much fuller and larger than what they uſually are. The whole are of the troops that were with general Heath.</p>
                  <p>General Knox, by a letter of the firſt inſtant, informs me, that, on mature inquiry and examination, he finds Springfield to be more convenient and much better calculated for an ela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boratory and cannon-foundery, than any other part of the New-England ſtates. He adds that a quantity of copper, tin, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther uſeful materials, can be had there; and that the neceſſary works and preparations, from theſe and other advantages, can be accompliſhed at leaſt three or four months ſooner there than any where elſe. In conſequence of his opinion, which I eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem of weight, particularly in this inſtance,—and knowing the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031423_0319_0FEC47EB876D7570"/>
importance of, and how eſſential theſe eſtabliſhments are,—I have ventured to order the works to be begun there, without regard to what had been done at Brookfield, which was of but little conſequence. The former, beſides the many advantages mentioned by general Knox, ſtands on Connecticut-river, and has a good navigation: yet is entirely ſecure againſt any at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts of the enemy, being twenty miles above Hartford, where the river is narrow, and too ſhoal to admit veſſels that can give the leaſt annoyance.—As nothing but the good of the ſervice could have led to this meaſure, I truſt it will be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
                  <p>I have wrote to the aſſembly of Maſſachuſetts ſtate and the convention of New-Hampſhire, requeſting their good offices and exertions to promote the raiſing of their regiments as ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peditiouſly as poſſible, and to forward the whole of the quotas firſt exacted from them, to Ticonderoga. Their contiguity to that poſt more than to any other,—the importance of it, and general Schuyler's apprehenſions that the enemy may attempt to paſs the lake (if not on the ice) as ſoon as it is open,—add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the great trouble, expenſe, and loſs of time it will ſave in marching them elſewhere, and others there, who are much more diſtant and remote,—induced me to determine ſo. I find the council of the former, on general Schuyler's earneſt appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, before my letter reached them, had determined to ſend four regiments as ſoon as they could be completed. I only wiſh the whole may be made up in a ſhort time, and that their arrival may be early enough to prevent thoſe inconveniences and fatal conſequences which the want of a ſufficient force in that quarter would ſubject us to, were the enemy to paſs the lakes at this time.</p>
                  <p>Mr. James Meaſe is now here in conſequence of being ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed clothier-general. He is adjuſting a plan for anſwering the end of his appointment, and making an eſtimate, to be laid before Congreſs or their ſecret committee, of ſuch clothes as may be neceſſary to import for the army.</p>
                  <p>It is with much concern that the ſituation of our affairs o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliges me to mention ſo frequently the want of money, eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally when I am perſuaded every means are uſed to furniſh it. Our diſtreſs on this account is great indeed; and the injury the ſervice receives, almoſt inconceivable:—not a day, an hour, or ſcarcely a minute paſſes, without complaints and applications on this head. The recruiting the regiments is moſt materially retarded by it.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>

                  <p>I DO myſelf the honor to incloſe you a plan drawn up by doctor Shippen in concert with doctor Cochran, for the arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and future regulation of the general hoſpital. As this plan is very extenſive, the appointments numerous, and the ſalaries affixed to them at preſent, large, I did not think myſelf at liberty to adopt any part of it before I laid it before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs for their approbation. I will juſt remark, that, though the expenſe attending an hoſpital upon the incloſed plan will be very great, it will in the end not only be ſaving to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic, but the only poſſible method of keeping an army a foot.</p>
                  <p>We are now, at an enormous bounty, and with no ſmall diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, recruiting an army of upwards of a hundred battalions. The enſuing campaign may, from the ſame cauſes, prove as ſickly as the laſt: and if the hoſpitals are in no better condition for the reception of the ſick, our regiments will be reduced to companies by the end of the campaign; and thoſe poor wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es who eſcape with life will be either ſcattered up and down the country, and not to be found, or if found, totally enervated and unfit for further duty. By theſe means not only the boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is loſt, but the man is loſt alſo: and I leave you to judge whether we have men enough to allow of ſuch a conſumption of lives and conſtitutions as have been loſt the laſt compaign. For my own part I am certain, that, if the army which I hope we ſhall have in the field this year is ſuffered to moulder away by ſickneſs as it did the laſt, we muſt look for reinforcements to ſome other places than our own ſtates.</p>
                  <p>The number of officers mentioned in the incloſed plan I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume are neceſſary for us, becauſe they are found ſo in the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh hoſpitals: and, as they are eſtabliſhed on the ſureſt baſis,—that of long experience under the ableſt phyſicians and ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons,—we ſhould not heſitate a moment in adopting their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations, when they ſo plainly tend to correct and improve our former want of method and knowledge in this important depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>The pay affixed to the different appointments is, as I ſaid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, great, and perhaps more than you may think adequate to
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031423_0321_0FEC5D45420B5C78"/>
the ſervice. In determining upon the ſum that is to be allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to each, you ought to conſider that it ſhould be ſuch as will induce gentlemen of character and ſkill in their profeſſion to ſtep forth, and in ſome manner adequate to the practice which they have at home: for, unleſs ſuch gentlemen are induced to take the care and management of our hoſpitals, we had better truſt to the force of nature and conſtitution, than ſuffer perſons entirely ignorant of medicine to deſtroy us by ill-directed appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations.</p>
                  <p>I hear from every quarter that the dread of undergoing the ſame miſeries for want of proper care and attention when ſick, has much retarded the new enliſtments, particularly to the ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. This is another reaſon for eſtabliſhing our hoſpitals up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on a large and generous plan: for we ought to make the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice as agreeable and enticing as poſſible to the ſoldiery, many of whom (eſpecially when we call forth the militia) not only quit the comforts but the luxuries of life.</p>
                  <p>A few days ago doctor * * * ſent me the incloſed manuſcript, which is a vindication of his conduct, upon which he deſires a court of inquiry may be held. I tranſmit it to you by his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. As I do not know what particular charges were al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged againſt him, I can ſay nothing to it or about it. You will find a plan of his alſo incloſed, for the better regulation of the hoſpital: but I think all his hints are included in doctor Shippen's plan.</p>
                  <p>As no time is to be loſt in appointing the neceſſary officers, fixing upon the proper places for hoſpitals, and many other preparations. I could wiſh that Congreſs would take this mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter under their immediate conſideration, and favor me with their ſentiments thereon as ſoon as poſſible.</p>

                  <p>THE principal deſign of this is to inform you that we have ſtrong reaſons to believe that the enemy are on the point of making ſome puſh. What their object is,—whether to beat up our quarters and to extend their own, to make a large fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage and collection of provender of which they are in great want, or to turn their views towards the Delaware,—is a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of uncertainty; but it ſeems probable that one of theſe things they have in contemplation. Such of their troops as have returned from Rhode-Iſland have landed at Amboy, and,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:031423_0322_0FEC5C606DC6CFA0"/>
with them ſeveral pieces of heavy artillery General Howe is come over too, and, it is ſaid lord Percy. Their number at Brunſwic and the landing-place, before the arrival of this laſt reinforcement, was eſtimated from ſeven to eight thouſand.</p>
                  <p>I have ordered the utmoſt vigilance and attention to be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved at our ſeveral poſts, to guard againſt ſurpriſes, and every preparation to be made that the weak and feeble ſtate of our little army will admit of. At this time we are only about four thouſand ſtrong,—a force, you will ſuppoſe, unequal to a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful oppoſition, if they were not militia, and far too ſmall for the exigencies of our affairs. It is impoſſible to obtain exact returns, though they are daily called for,—owing to the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and almoſt conſtant departure of ſome of the corps.</p>
                  <p>Colonel Neilſon of Brunſwic, with a detachment of militia, on the morning of the eighteenth, ſurpriſed major Stockdon, whom he took with fifty-nine privates of general Skinner's corps, killing four, and bringing away the arms of the whole, with ſome blankets. This about balances the loſs of a militia guard which a party of Britiſh troops took laſt week in Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, near the Hook.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh to be informed how the regiments that are raiſing are to be armed, and of the proviſion that has been made for the ſame. I have reaſon to fear, indeed I am convinced, that there is a great deficiency in many, if not in the whole of the ſtates, in this article: every letter that I receive from them mentions their want, and calls for ſupplies.</p>

                  <p>MONSIEUR Fanéuil, who ſome time ago laid a plan be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you for raiſing and officering a corps of Frenchmen, waited upon me yeſterday. His ſucceſs, as I expected, has been ſmall in enliſting or rather engaging Canadians. I cannot find that he has met with more than thirty or forty who would be willing to ſerve with him. He is now upon another ſcheme,—that of raiſing, arming, and clothing a number of men in the French iſlands.—To grant a commiſſion of that kind is without the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of my powers, and I have therefore deſired him to go for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and lay his propoſals before Congreſs. If they appear feaſible they may be adopted: but I would beg leave to obſerve that one precaution will be neceſſary, that is, that the commiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of monſieur Eanéuil and his officers ſhould depend upon the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:031423_0323_0FEC5C181E166C50"/>
performance of their agreement for raiſing any certain number of men.</p>
                  <p>I have often mentioned to you the diſtreſs I am every now and then laid under by the application of French officers for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions in our ſervice. This evil, if I may call it ſo, is a grow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one: for, from what I learn, they are coming in ſwarms from old France and the iſlands. There will therefore be a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of providing for them or diſcountenancing them. To do the firſt is difficult; and the laſt, diſagreeable, and perhaps im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>politic if they are men of merit:—and it is impoſſible to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh theſe from mere adventurers, of whom. I am convinced, there are the greateſt number. They ſeldom bring more than a commiſſion and paſſport, which, we know, may belong to a bad as well as a good officer.</p>
                  <p>Their ignorance of our language, and their inability to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit men, are unſurmountable obſtacles to their being ingraft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into our continental battalions: for our officers, who have raiſed their men, and have ſerved through the war upon pay that has hitherto not borne their expenſes, would be diſguſted if foreigners were put over their heads:—and I aſſure you, few or none of theſe gentlemen look lower than field-officers' com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions. To give them all brevets, by which they have rank and draw pay without doing any ſervice, is ſaddling the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent with a vaſt expenſe: and to form them into corps, would be only eſtabliſhing corps of officers; for, as I ſaid before, they cannot poſſibly raiſe any men.</p>
                  <p>Some general mode of diſpoſing of them muſt be adopted; for it is ungenerous to keep them in ſuſpenſe, and at great charge to themſelves: but I am at a loſs how to point out this mode.—Suppoſe they were told in general, that no man could obtain a commiſſion, except he could raiſe a number of men in proportion to his rank. This would effectually ſtop the mouths of common appliers, and would leave us at liberty to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for gentlemen of undoubted military character and merit, who would be very uſeful to us as ſoon as they acquired our language.</p>
                  <p>If you approve of this, or can think of any better method, be pleaſed to inform me as ſoon as you poſſibly can: for, if I had a deciſive anſwer to give them, it would not only ſave me much trouble, but much time, which I am now obliged to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtow in hearing their different pretentions to merit, and their expectations thereupon.</p>

                  <p>CONGRESS having reſolved that ſeveral regiments of cavalry ſhould be raiſed to form a part of their army, I beg leave, through you, to lay before them the incloſed liſt of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers which appear neceſſary to be appointed to each corps, and which they will be pleaſed to eſtabliſh. At the ſame time I ſhould ſuppoſe it highly expedient to fix their pay and that of the privates. There is now one regiment in ſervice, and three more recruiting: this makes it indiſpenſably neceſſary that it ſhould be done. Applications are conſtantly making, to know what the pay is, and objections raiſed againſt the ſervice for want of due information.</p>
                  <p>I have tranſmitted a liſt of ſuch pay as ſeemed to be thought reaſonable for part of the officers to receive when colonel Shel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don's regiment was directed to be levied, and a copy of the memorandum made at that time. This, colonel Sheldon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, would not be more than adequate to their ſervices, trouble, and expenſe, and which in ſome degree was founded on the opinions of other gentlemen of whom inquiry was made upon the ſubject. I did not fix it in the inſtances where it is ſet down with certainty, as the memorandum will ſhew. A cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terion, by which I was alſo governed upon that occaſion, was the reſolve appointing Mr. Sheldon lieutenant-colonel comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant with the rank and pay of colonel. From thence I attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to proportion that of ſome other officers.—Upon the whole I think it ſhould be ſettled without further loſs of time, and wiſh the earlieſt attention of Congreſs to be had to it.</p>
                  <p>Our delicate and truly critical ſituation, for want of a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient force to oppoſe the enemy who are now ready, and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore many days elapſe, will take the field, induced me to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that the troops raiſing in the ſouthern ſtates, and intended for this army, would march in companies or half companies as they were made up, without waiting for their regiments to be complete. Policy ſtrongly ſuggeſted the propriety of the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and I requeſted it: but, to my great anxiety and ſurpriſe, I am told that this line of conduct is totally neglected, though a great number of recruits are actually engaged. I muſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat Congreſs to interpoſe again with their moſt preſſing appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:031423_0325_0FEC5C66FAE83340"/>
and commands that this expedient may be adopted with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a moment's delay. No injury can reſult from it, becauſe a ſufficient number of proper officers can and muſt be left, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruit the corps to their full complement.</p>
                  <p>Nor will my fears reſpecting the ſtate of our arms allow me to be ſilent on that head. Let the ſtates be urged to ſend their men equipped with them, and every other neceſſary, if poſſible. I know not what ſupplies may be in ſtore elſewhere, or in the power of Congreſs: but they muſt not depend upon their being furniſhed here with any, or but with very few:—no human prudence or precaution could ſecure but a ſmall part of thoſe belonging to the public, and in the hands of the ſoldiery, from being embezzled and carried off when their time of ſervice ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pired; nor can the ſame abuſes be reſtrained in the militia.</p>

                  <p>NO military operation of any conſequence has occurred ſince I had the honor of writing to you laſt, except that on ſunday I received information that the enemy were advancing in a manner and in numbers ſo much greater than uſual, that it looked like a prelude to an attack upon our poſts, which were immediately put in the beſt preparation to receive them. It turned out to be only a ſtronger foraging party than uſual. They were however oppoſed in ſo ſpirited a manner by our ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced parties, that they were checked, and retired in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternoon towards Amboy, from whence they came. Their loſs in the courſe of the day from the beſt accounts I can get, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to about one hundred in killed, wounded, priſoners, and deſerters. Some people who were near the ſcene of action, and who have picked up accounts from thoſe who have ſince been in Amboy, are ſanguine enough to ſuppoſe that they loſt five hundred altogether: but of this I have no conception.—Our loſs was only two killed and ten wounded.</p>
                  <p>I was in hopes, that, by the time the militia who are now in ſervice would be diſcharged, we ſhould have a conſiderable number of the new levies in the field: but, though I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports from all quarters of the great ſucceſs of recruiting, I cannot get a man of them into ſervice. General Johnſon's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia all go the fifth of March (many are gone already), and general Lincoln's on the fifteenth. Theſe two bodies form ſo conſiderable a part of our force, that, unleſs they are replaced
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:031423_0326_0FEC5C6DECC85330"/>
I ſhall be left in a manner deſtitute: for I have no great hopes of ſeeing an equal number of continental troops by that time.</p>
                  <p>I have wrote to Pennſylvania, to endeavor to get a reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of militia from thence; and I am told the militia from the counties of Baltimore, Hartford, and Cecil, in Maryland, are on their march: but as I have it not from any authority, I know not when to expect them, or in what numbers. They are about paſſing a militia-law in this ſtate, which may perhaps have ſome effect: but at preſent they are under no regulation at all.</p>
                  <p>I have in my late letters recommended ſeveral things to your conſideration, particularly that of a promotion of general offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. The very well-being of the new army depends upon its being done ſpeedily. Not only this, but we are now ſuffering for want of brigadiers. General Scuyler has wrote moſt preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly for the aſſiſtance of general officers; and I have none to ſend him without injuring the ſervice in this quarter.—The hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital plan too requires an anſwer, as nothing can be done in the nomination of the proper officers till I have your determination. There are ſeveral other matters of conſequence before you, to which I am waiting your anſwers before I can proceed upon the reſpective points to which they refer.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed you have a letter from the widow of a brave officer, who was killed at Princeton. If any proviſion is made, I do not recollect what it is: if there is any, pleaſe to inform me: if there is not, I can venture to recommend her as a proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to make ſome reparation for her great loſs.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I WAS this evening honored with your favor of the twenty-third ultimo, accompanied by ſundry proceedings of Congreſs. Thoſe reſpecting general Lee, and which preſcribe
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:031423_0327_0FEC5C7504604CE0"/>
the treatment of lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the five Heſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian field-officers, are the cauſe of this letter.</p>
                  <p>Though I ſincerely commiſerate the misfortunes of general Lee, and feel much for his preſent unhappy ſituation, yet, with all poſſible deference to the opinion of Congreſs, I fear that theſe reſolutions would not have the deſired effect,—are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in impolicy,—and will, if adhered to, produce conſequences of an extenſive and melancholy nature, Retaliation is certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſt, and ſometimes neceſſary, even where attended with the ſevereſt penalties: but, when the evils which may and muſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult from it exceed thoſe intended to be redreſſed, prudence and policy require that it ſhould be avoided.—Having premiſed thus much, I beg leave to examine the juſtice and expediency of it in the inſtances now before us.</p>
                  <p>From the beſt information I have been able to obtain, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Lee's uſage has not been ſo diſgraceful and diſhonorable as to authoriſe the treatment decreed to thoſe gentlemen, was it not prohibited by many other important conſiderations. His confinement, I believe, has been more rigorous than has been generally experienced by the reſt of our officers, or thoſe of the enemy who have been in our poſſeſſion: but if the reports be true (received on that head), he has been provided with a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent apartment and with moſt things neceſſary to render him comfortable. This is not the caſe with one of the officers com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in the reſolves, if his letter, of which a copy is tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, deſerves your credit. Here retaliation ſeems to have been prematurely begun; or, to ſpeak with more propriety, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verities have been and are exerciſed towards colonel Campbell, not juſtified by any that general Lee has yet received.</p>
                  <p>In point of policy, under the preſent ſituation of our affairs, this doctrine cannot be ſupported. The balance of priſoners is greatly againſt us; and a general regard to the happineſs of the whole ſhould mark our conduct. Can we imagine that our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies will not mete the ſame puniſhments, the ſame indigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, the ſame cruelties, to thoſe belonging to us, in their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion, that we impoſe on theirs in our power? Why ſhould we ſuppoſe them to poſſeſs more humanity than we have our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? or why ſhould an ineffectual attempt to relieve the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of one brave unfortunate man involve many more in the ſame calamities?</p>
                  <p>However diſagreeable the fact may be, the enemy at this time have in their power, and ſubject to their call, near three hundred officers belonging to the army of the United States. In this number, there are ſome of high rank; and moſt of them
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:031423_0328_0FEC47E991436348"/>
are men of bravery and merit. The quota of theirs in our hands bears no proportion, being not more than fifty at moſt. Under theſe circumſtances, we ſhould certainly do no act to draw upon the gentlemen belonging to us, and who have alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſuffered a long captivity, greater puniſhments than they have and now experience. If we ſhould, what will their feelings be, and thoſe of their numerous and extenſive connexions?—Suppoſe the treatment preſcribed for the Heſſians ſhould be purſued, will it not eſtabliſh what the enemy have been aiming to effect by every artifice and the groſſeſt miſrepreſentations,—I mean, an opinion of our enmity towards them, and the cruel conduct they experience when they fall into our hands,—a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice which we on our part have heretofore thought it politic to ſuppreſs and to root out by every act of lenity and of kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? It certainly will:—the Heſſians would hear of the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with all the circumſtances of heightened exaggeration,—would feel the injury, without inveſtigating the cauſe, or rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning upon the juſtice or neceſſity of it. The miſchiefs, which may and muſt inevitably flow from the execution of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves, appear to be endleſs and innumerable.</p>
                  <p>On my own part, I have been much embarraſſed on the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of exchanges already. Applications are daily made by both friends and enemies, to complete them as far as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of number and rank will apply. Some of the former have complained that a diſcrimination is about to be adopted, perhaps injurious to their reputation, and certainly depriving them of their right of exchange in due courſe, as eſtabliſhed upon the principles of equality propoſed laſt year, acceded to by both parties, and now ſubſiſting. The latter charge me with a breech of faith, and call upon me to perform the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>Many more objections might be ſubjoined, were they mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial:—I ſhall only obſerve, that the preſent ſtate of our army (if it deſerves that name) will not authoriſe the language of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taliation or the ſtyle of menace. This will be conceded by all who know that the whole of our force is weak and trifling, and compoſed of militia (a very few regular troops excepted) whoſe ſervice is on the eve of expiring.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral other matters which might be mentioned upon this ſubject, would time and opportunity permit: but, as they will not, I beg leave to refer you to colonel Walker, who will deliver this, and give ſatisfaction to any enquiries that may be deemed neceſſary. Perſuading myſelf that Congreſs will in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge the liberty I have taken upon this occaſion, I have only
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:031423_0329_0FEC5C1C5BC83690"/>
to wiſh for the reſult of their deliberations after they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſidered the reſolves, and to aſſure them that—I have the honor to be. &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>I do myſelf the honor to tranſmit you the incloſed copy of a letter from general Lee, received by a flag on Tueſday laſt. You will perceive from thence his wiſhes and expectations of ſeeing ſome members of Congreſs in conſequence of his letter upon that ſubject. None of the paſſports which he mentions were ſent out, though the letter came by general Howe's per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion as the others did. I ſhould be happy to relieve his anxiety as far as I could, by ſending in major Morris: but this I cannot do till a ſafe conduct is granted.</p>
                  <p>The more I conſider the reſolves reſpecting lieutenant colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Campbell and the Heſſian officers, the more convinced I am of their impolicy. The propoſition made by Congreſs for the exchange of priſoners, and which by their direction was tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to general Howe, was founded on principles of equality in number and in rank. From hence no demand, as a matter of right, can be made of general Lee's releaſement for any officer or number of officers of inferior rank: whatever is or might be done in ſuch inſtance, would be of favor and indulgence. The only cartel that now ſubſiſts is the one I have mentioned. This, ſo far as it goes, is a beneficial one: it recogniſes the rank of our officers, and inſures their diſcharge from captivity whenever we are poſſeſſed of a like number belonging to them, and of the ſame rank. If on our part it ſhould be violated,—if it is not obſerved,—ſurely it will and muſt ceaſe to be obligatory on ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Howe. What conſequences may then enſue, I leave to your conjecture.</p>
                  <p>If it be objected that the above obſervations, and what I ſaid in my former letter, prove that no treatment received by our officers ſhould be retaliated on theirs,—my anſwer is, that the proportion of officers in their hands is at leaſt ſix to one in ours. This conſideration, ſuppoſing we had a right to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand general Lee's liberty, would be of great weight, and ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient to prevent, in my opinion, the execution of the reſolves.—I have the honor to be, in haſte, your moſt obedient ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant.</p>

                  <p>I WAS honored ſeveral days ago with your letter of the twenty-fifth ultimo, with its incloſures, the receipt of which was omitted to be acknowledged in my laſt.</p>
                  <p>Could I accompliſh the important objects ſo eagerly wiſhed by Congreſs,—"confining the enemy within their preſent quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters,—preventing their getting ſupplies from the country, and totally ſubduing them before they are reinforced,"—I ſhould be happy indeed. But what proſpect or hope can there be of my effecting ſo deſirable a work at this time? The incloſed return, to which I ſolicit the moſt ſerious attention of Congreſs, comprehends the whole force I have in Jerſey. It is but a handful, and bears no proportion, on the ſcale of numbers, to that of the enemy. Added to this, the major part is made up of militia. The moſt ſanguine in ſpeculation cannot deem it more than adequate to the leaſt valuable purpoſes of war.</p>
                  <p>The reinforcements mentioned to be drawn from general Heath were merely ideal,—nearly the whole of the eaſtern troops which were with him being here before. They were only engaged till to-day: and to-day they leave the camp. Their ſervice has been of pretty long continuance, and almoſt the whole of the winter months. What proſpect there may be of immediate ſuccours from other quarters, I know not: but from the militia of this ſtate I cannot expect to derive much more aid. Thoſe who are well effected have been ſo frequently cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led from their home, that they are tired out, and almoſt profeſs an abhorrence of the ſervice: nor have I heard as yet that any continental troops are on the way. I have wrote to the briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers-general in moſt of the ſtates upon the ſubject, and alſo to the colonels, urging them by every motive to exert themſelves in filling the regiments and to forward them on.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, ſir, I feel the moſt painful anxiety when I reflect on our ſituation and that of the enemy. Unleſs the levies ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive ſoon, we muſt, before it be long, experience ſome intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and melancholy event. I believe the enemy have fixed their object, and the execution will ſurely be attempted as ſoon as the roads are paſſable. The unprepared ſtate in which we are, favors all their deſigns; and it is much to be wiſhed that they may not ſucceed to their warmeſt expectations.</p>
                  <p>On recurring to the late promotions of brigadiers, I find the number appointed to be ſhort of what I took the liberty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend, and not competent to the exigencies of the ſervice ſuppoſing the whole in office before, and thoſe lately created,
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031423_0331_0FEC5C7B88257AD0"/>
onſent to act, which I have reaſon to believe will not be the caſe. I ſhall only beg leave to refer you to my former letters upon this ſubject, and to aſſure you that many diſadvantages will reſult from not having a ſufficient number of officers of this rank. We have always been deficient in this inſtance; and certain I am that the ſervice is greatly injured by it. The proportion I mentioned was full ſmall, and, in my opinion, ſhould not be diſpenſed with.</p>
                  <p>I would alſo take the liberty of mentioning again (having received no anſwer upon the ſubject) that ſettling the hoſpital plan and eſtabliſhment becomes more and more neceſſary. It is an object of infinite importance; and the difficulties of doing it on a proper foundation will be great, if not almoſt inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable, ſhould it be deferred till the campaign opens, and the enemy begin their operations. The benefits of the inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will ſoon be known:—the want was ſeverely felt in the courſe of the laſt year.</p>
                  <p>There is one thing more which claims, in my opinion, the earlieſt attention of Congreſs,—I mean the pay of the regimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ſurgeons, and that of the mates. Theſe appointments are ſo eſſential, that they cannot be done without. The pay, in the firſt inſtance, is ſo low, ſo inadequate to the ſervices which ſhould be performed, that no man ſuſtaining the character of a gentlemen, and who has the leaſt medical abilities or ſkill in the profeſſion, can think of accepting it: that in the latter is ſo paltry and trifling, that none, of the leaſt generoſity of ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or pretentions to merit, can conſent to act for it. In a word, theſe are inconveniencies of an intereſting nature:—they amount to an excluſion of perſons who could diſcharge the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of thoſe offices; and, if not redreſſed, there is not the ſmalleſt probability that any can be prevailed on to enter them again.</p>
                  <p>There are ſeveral matters alſo which I refered to Congreſs ſome time ſince, and upon which I have not received the reſult of their diliberations.—one enquiry, about the ſtate of arms and ammunition, I am peculiarly anxious to be ſatisfied in.</p>
                  <p>From the inconveniences and injuries to the ſervice of late for want of money, I am induced to requeſt that the ſtricteſt regard ſhould be had to furniſhing the paymaſter with conſtant and ſufficient ſupplies. On ſunday he received five hundred thouſand dollars, half of which is already expended, and the balance in a day or two will be entirely ſwept away, without diſcharging the ſeveral claims. By his report, the commiſſary here requires an immediate draught for a hundred thouſand;
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:031423_0332_0FEC5C7DA3EF18C0"/>
and the militia returning and about to leave camp, a hundred and twenty thouſand—more. The expenſe incurred by calling on them ſo frequently is almoſt incredible. Beſides theſe, there are ſeveral arrears due to the old troops, and to moſt of the general and ſtaff officers.</p>

However, from the moſt accurate eſtimate that I can form, the whole of our numbers in Jerſey, fit for duty at this time, is under three thouſand. Theſe (nine hundred and eighty-one excepted) are militia, and ſtand engaged only till the laſt of this month. The troops under inoculation, including their attendants, amount to about one thouſand.</p>

                  <p>THE difficulty if not impoſſibility of giving Congreſs a juſt idea of our ſituation (and of ſeveral other important matters requiring their earlieſt attention) by letter, has induced me to prevail on major-general Greene to wait upon them for that purpoſe. This gentleman is ſo much in my confidence, ſo inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mately acquainted with my ideas,—with our ſtrength and our weakneſſes,—with every thing reſpecting the army,—that I have thought it neceſſary to particulariſe or preſcribe any certain line of duty or inquiries for him. I ſhall only ſay, from the rank he holds as an able and good officer in the eſtimation of all who knew him, he deſerves the greateſt reſpect; and much regard is due to his opinions in the line of his profeſſion. He has upon his mind ſuch matters as appear to me moſt material to be immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately conſidered of; and many more will probably ariſe during the intercourſe you may think proper to honor him with;—on all which I wiſh to have the ſenſe of Congreſs, and the relult of ſuch a deliberation as may be formed thereupon.</p>
                  <p>I have encloſed an extract of a letter received yeſterday from governor Trumbull, with a copy of one intercepted, going from the late governor Wentworth to his ſiſter. The information contained in the letter, if true, is important and intereſting: how far it is to be relied on, I cannot determine: but there can be no doubt of the Britiſh court's ſtraining every nerve and intereſt at home and abroad, to bend us to their * * * yoke.</p>

                  <p>COLONEL Palfrey, having expreſſed a deſire to ſettle the accounts of his office to this time, has obtained my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to repair to Philadelphia, and now waits on Congreſs with his books and vouchers, hoping that a committee will be appointed to examine and adjuſt the ſame.</p>
                  <p>The diſadvantages which have ariſen to the ſervice, and which have been ſeverely felt, for want of conſtant ſupplies in the military cheſt, are almoſt incredible, and are not to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribed but with great difficulty to thoſe who are not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately in the army, and privy to the frequent and importunate applications that are made. To prevent inconveniencies of the like nature in future, I have thought it proper that an eſtimate of the monthly advances ſhould be formed and laid before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. This colonel Palfrey will do; and, though it cannot be effected with a degree of ſcrupulous exactneſs and preciſion, yet from his intimate knowledge of the incidental charges and expenſes in the common courſe of things, the calculation, I apprehend, will be attended with many benefits. It will ſhew Congreſs the neceſſary proviſions of money to be made for ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary contingencies, and enable them to form a rule for their government in the inſtance of ſupplies for the army.</p>

                  <p>YESTERDAY a letter, of which the incloſed is a copy, came to my hands. The account is confirmed by a countryman who is ſince come in: but nothing diſtinct has yet been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="unknown:031423_0334_0FEC5C8464AFA5B8"/>
The aid required of me in colonel Hay's letter cannot be given: I have no men to oppoſe the ennemy's deſigns in any one quarter, although called upon from every quarter. All that was poſſible for me to do towards collecting a force at Peekſkill, I had attempted before:—I had in peremptory terms called upon the officers of Rhode-Iſland and Connecticut to forward on their recruits under proper officers as faſt as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to that place: I had directed ſuch of the New-York regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as had been ordered to Ticonderoga, to repair thither: I had requeſted eight of the Maſſachuſetts regiments to be march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to that poſt: and, leſt theſe ſhould not arrive in time, I urg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed governor Trumbull, in a letter of the ſixth inſtant, to ſend two thouſand of his militia to the ſame place. But ſorry I am to obſerve, the militia have got tired; and the colonels of the continental regiments have been greatly deceived themſelves,—have greatly deceived me,—or the moſt unheard-of deſertions * * * have prevailed * * *: for regiments, reported two or three months ago to be half completed, are, upon the colonels being called upon in poſitive terms for a juſt ſtate of them, found to contain leſs than one hundred men; and this not the caſe of a ſingle regiment only, but of many. In Connecticut alone, by a letter from general Parſons, of the ſixth inſtant, four regiments are mentioned as not having more than eighty rank and file, each.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, ſir, are melancholy truths: but facts they are, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to be known to Congreſs, however prudent it may be to conceal them from the obſervation of others.</p>
                  <p>To ſuperintend the buſineſs of recruiting,—to ſee that the officers were diligent,—to prevent impoſitions if poſſible,—to appoint fit places of rendezvous,—to ſee that the recruits were actually brought to thoſe places, and there equipped and train<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the field,—were among the great objects which early and repeatedly induced me to preſs the appointment of general officers: but unfortunately the delay of appointing, being fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the reſignation of ſome officers and non-acceptance of others, will involve the army in a mere chaos of confuſion at a time when the utmoſt order and regularity ſhould prevail, and when all our arrangements ought to be completely eſtabliſhed. The medical department will, it is much to be ſeared, be in the ſame ſituation:—not an officer yet appointed to it.</p>
                  <p>For want of proper and coercive powers,—from diſaffection and other cauſes,—the militia of this ſtate are not to be depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon. They are drawn out with difficulty, and at a moſt enormous expenſe, as their accounts will ſhew: they come, you
<pb facs="unknown:031423_0335_0FEC5C86532AE028"/>
can ſcarce tell how; they go, you hardly know when. In the ſame predicament are thoſe of Pennſylvania.</p>
                  <p>Numbers from this ſtate have joined the enemy; and many more are diſpoſed to do ſo, as the letter from Mr. Hoff (a copy of which is incloſed, correſponding with ſeveral others of the ſame tenor) ſufficiently evinces.</p>

                     <p>P. S. Small as our preſent force is, it will be reduced in a few days by the going off of the Jerſey three-months men, the Cecil-county militia, and the Virginia volunteers, all of whom claim diſcharges the firſt of next month. I have ſent an officer expreſs towards Peekſkill to inquire into the circumſtances and conſequence of the enemy's deſcent upon that place,—not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to account for general M'Dougal's (who commands there) and general Clinton's (who is at the forts in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands) their ſilence upon this occaſion.</p>

                  <p>I LAST night had the honor to receive your leter of the twenty-ſixth inſtant, accompanied by ſundry reſolves of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and ſome other papers.</p>
                  <p>The arrival of the arms, locks, and flints, you have been pleaſed to mention, is a moſt fortunate and happy event. I join you moſt ſincerely in congratulations upon the occaſion.</p>
                  <p>I have not yet obtained a certain account of the expedition againſt and deſtruction or Peekſkill. Information of thoſe e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents has not been yet tranſmitted by generals M'Dougal or Clinton, or the convention of the ſtate. There is no doubt but that the town is deſtroyed, and, with it, ſome ſtores:—neither the quality nor amount of them is known. It is ſaid that it was done in part by our own people when they found that they could not prevent them falling into the enemy's hands.—The ſhips and troops have gone down the river again.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Kirkland, the Oneida miſſionary, arrived here this week with a chief warrior and five other Indians of that nation. They had been to Boſton, and came from thence to this place to inquire into the true ſtate of matters, that they might report them to a grand council to be ſhortly held. They ſaid things were ſo falſely and variouſly repreſented by our enemies through their agents, that they did not know what to depend on. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited them to go to Philadelphia: but they declined it, decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring they were well ſatisfied with what they had ſeen, and that
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:031423_0336_0FEC5C90DC0DAFB8"/>
they were authoriſed to tell their nation, all they had heard from the enemy was falſe. Being told that France was aſſiſting us, and about to join in the war, they ſeemed highly pleaſed; and Mr. Kirkland ſaid he was perſuaded it would have a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable effect on the minds of ſeveral of the nations, and ſecure to us their neutrality, if not a declaration and commencement of hoſtilities in our favor. I ſhewed them every civility in my power, and every thing that I thought material to excite in them an idea of our ſtrength and independence. After ſtaying two days, they ſet off for their nation expreſſing their deſire of the moſt ſpeedy return to the council, and profeſſing the moſt friendly ſentiments towards us.</p>

                  <p>CAPTAIN Deſhields, of Mr. Buchanan's ſhip from Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>temore, who was taken by the enemy and carried into York, made his eſcape from thence on ſaturday evening. He informs that three thouſand troops Britiſh and Heſſian, embarked about ten days ago from the city and Staten-Iſland, on board tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports which were lying at the latter when he came away. He adds that the enemy have built and are building a number of light flat bottomed boats, about ſeventy of which are finiſhed.</p>

Captain Deſhields ſays it ſeemed to be the general opinion and converſation that this embarkation was for Cheſapeak-bay, with a view of making a deſcent on the Eaſtern-Shore, or that the troops were to proceed to the Head of Elk, taking Anna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polis and Baltimore in their way. There were ſome who thought it probable they mean to go up the North-river and attempt the Highland fortifications.—I have written to generals M'Dougal and Clinton, deſiring them to make the beſt preparation that circumſtances will admit of, for their reception, in caſe the latter ſhould be their object.</p>
                  <p>Captain Deſhields being in company with the captain of the packet, but unknown to him, heard him ſay that a war with France was much expected when he left England, which was about the beginning of February.</p>

Every pruden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial ſtep appears to have been taken by the general, and as good a diſpoſition made as his ſmall number of men would ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit of.</p>
                  <p>I have heard nothing further reſpecting the embarkation of troops which I mentioned in my laſt.—I am in hopes the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut militia will arrive at Peekſkill before another expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is made up the North-river. I have wrote to haſten them as much as poſſible, leſt ſuch another deſign ſhould be really in agitation.—In my opinion, Delaware bay is their object, and Cheſapeak only thrown out by way of blind: their late attempt to procure Delaware pilots ſeems to confirm it.</p>
                  <p>I obſerve by your late promotions that a foreign gentleman is appointed to the command of the German batallion.

                  <p>I AM honored with yours of the fourth, incloſing ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dry reſolves of Congreſs from the twenty-ninth of March to the fifth inſtant.—I am extremely glad to ſee the reſolve for the immediate removal of military ſtores from Baltimore and Annapolis; for, although I do not imagine that the enemy in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend an expedition of any great conſequence in Cheſapeak-bay yet while the ſtores lay at the above-mentioned places, they were always ſubject to be deſtroyed by a ſudden attack of a ſhip of war with a few land forces.</p>
                  <p>The regulations for the paymaſter-general's department are very ſalutary, and, if carried ſtrictly into execution, will make a vaſt ſaving to the public. It may be eaſily done when the army is put upon a regular footing: but, while we are obliged to make uſe of militia, we muſt ſubmit to all the irregularities that naturally attend them, and muſt not therefore expect to have the rule as ſcrupulouſly complied with by them as could be wiſhed. * * *</p>
                  <p>The muſter-maſter-general complained that the duty required of him was more than he could perform: but by the late re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves there is an ample allowance for deputies; and therefore no further excuſe can be made upon that head.</p>
                  <p>I moſt ardently wiſh to ſee the hoſpital eſtabliſhed. I am afraid too much time has been loſt in the conſideration of the plan: but the gentlemen who ſhall be appointed to the ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendence muſt endeavor to make up for loſt time by their dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
                  <p>By the lateſt accounts from Brunſwic, it looks as if the enemy were projecting an embarkation. They have been ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping the buildings of boards, and cutting ſmall timber, and tranſporting them from Brunſwic to Amboy. It is imagined this is to build births in their tranſports.—I ſhall keep a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant look-out upon the motions of the veſſels, and ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to obtain every intelligence by ſending people into their quarters.—I think Delaware-bay muſt be their deſtination if they move by water.</p>

                  <p>I WAS juſt now honored with your letter of the ninth inſtant, covering ſundry reſolutions of Congreſs. Thoſe for regulating the hoſpital and medical department, I truſt, will prove of the moſt ſalutary conſequences. It is only to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gretted that this neceſſary and liberal inſtitution had not been gone into and completed at an earlier period.</p>
                  <p>The honors Congreſs have decreed to the memory of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals Warren and Mercer, afford me the higheſt pleaſure: their character and merit had a juſt claim to every mark on reſpect; and I heartily wiſh that every officer of the United States, emulating their virtues, may by their actions ſecure to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves the ſame right to the grateful tributes of their country.</p>
                  <p>Since writing to you yeſterday I have received further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence of the enemy's preparations in York, indicating a movement before long. It is contained in the incloſed letter, No. 1, and corroborates the opinion I have long entertained that they would make a puſh againſt Philadelphia. The tory regiments mentioned, we are told, are at Hackinſac, and are about five hundred ſtrong, excluſive of a company of High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landers which is with them.</p>
                  <p>The incloſed letter from le chevalier count De Vrecourt came to hand this morning,—which I have thought proper to tranſmit to Congreſs, that they may conſider his caſe, and adopt ſuch meaſures reſpecting him as his character and teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monials deſerve. I never heard of him before: but if he is a ſkilful engineer, he will be extremely uſeful, and ſhould be employed, though he may not underſtand our language. At this time we have not one with the army, nor one to join it, of the leaſt reputation or pretenſions to ſkill. If this gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man came in conſequence of an agreement with doctor Frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lin, and brought credentials from him, I ſhould ſuppoſe him to be acquainted with what he was recommended for.</p>
                  <p>The cartel, propoſed to be ſettled, and ſo long in agitation, is not accompliſhed yet: the laſt meeting on that buſineſs was the ſecond inſtant, when nothing was done; nor is a further interview appointed reſpecting it. I have tranſmitted a copy of lord Cornwallis's letter which came out the next day, with that of the paper alluded to by him, which Mr. Harriſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to receive from colonel Walcot, and of my anſwer to the latter in a letter to general Howe. The objections or ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles mentioned by colonel Walcot were thoſe general Greene had with him, and which he left when he came from Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia:
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:031423_0340_0FEC5C9859131528"/>
the original I have by me. Thoſe points were inſiſted on again, and rejected, and a tender made of the paper by co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonel Walcot, which he brought with him prepared.</p>
                  <p>I have appointed John Wilkins, John Steel, Mathew Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vin, and Samuel Kerſley, eſquires, captains of companies to be raiſed by them, in conſequence of the recommendation of general Armſtrong. As the intereſt of thoſe gentlemen lies in Pennſylvania chiefly, and it would be drawing money from the paymaſter here to carry to Philadelphia (ſuppoſing there was a ſupply in the cheſt, which is not the caſe), I ſhall be obliged by Congreſs's ordering ſix hundred dollars to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced to each of them on account of the recruiting ſervice; the firſt of whom I imagine is in Philadelphia. If this requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition can be complied with, he, I preſume, will give notice to the reſt; or, if general Armſtrong is informed of it, he will do it.</p>

                  <p>I AM honored with yours of the tenth, accompanied with one from the committee of Congreſs to whom I have wrote very fully upon the ſubject of the reſolve for forming an army upon the weſt ſide of Delaware, and to which I refer you.—I wiſh I could ſee any proſpect of an army, fit to make pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per oppoſition, formed any where. You will perhaps be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed at this after the public reports of the great ſucceſs of recruiting in all the ſtates; but, to convince you that theſe are but bare reports, I will give you the beſt information I have been able to collect from actual returns and other accounts.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="unknown:031423_0341_0FEC5C9B05874498"/>
New-Hampſhire.—No returns: but a letter from general Heath ſays they are tolerably forward.—All their regiments go to the northward.</p>
                  <p>Maſſachuſetts.—About four hundred men raiſed to a regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; many of theſe yet to undergo inoculation. Seven of their regiments go to the northward, and eight are to come to Peekſkill for the preſent.</p>
                  <p>Rhode-Iſland.—Only three hundred and ſixty men enliſted in both regiments the firſt of April. Two hundred of theſe are yet to be inocualted.—General Varnum writes me that he deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairs of filling up the regiments.</p>
                  <p>Connecticut.—By a return from general Parſons, of the fourth of April, about eighteen hundred men were recruited through the whole ſtate,—they, much diſperſed;—many to have the ſmall-pox; and recruiting at a ſtand.</p>
                  <p>New-York.—About two hundred men to a regiment: and, from the peculiar ſituation of that province, it will be almoſt impoſſible for them to fill up their regiments though they exert themſelves very much.</p>
                  <p>New-Jerſew.—Between two and three hundred to a regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. They alſo lie under many difficulties on account of the diſaffection of their ſtate: but their officers are active and dili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.</p>
                  <p>Pennſylvania.—Moſt of her regiments are very backward,—thoſe moſt ſo, who have been longeſt recruiting.</p>
                  <p>Delaware ſtate.—No return of their regiment.</p>
                  <p>Maryland.—I have only the return of one regiment, which conſiſts of two hundred men: but I do not believe the others are in more forwardneſs. The diſputes about the rank of offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers have prevailed ſo much, that the recruiting ſervice has been in a manner neglected.</p>
                  <p>Virginia.—The nine old regiments will not exceed eighteen hundred effective men: and governor Henry, in a letter which I received yeſterday, informs me that he did not think that more than four of the ſix new ones would be filled. He pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes the expediency of raiſing volunteer companies to ſerve ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven or eight months, to make up the deficiency: but this I ſhall object to on many accounts, particularly that it would be introducing a body of men who would look upon themſelves at liberty to do what they pleaſed, and, the moment their time expired would leave us, though at the moſt critical juncture.</p>
                  <p>If the men that are raiſed, few as they are, could be got into the field, it would be a matter of ſome conſolation: but eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry method that I have been able to deviſe has proved ineffec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:031423_0342_0FEC5C9F87854718"/>
If I ſend an officer to collect the ſick and ſcattered of his regiment, it is ten to one but he neglects his duty, goes home on pleaſure or buſineſs, and the next that I hear of him is that he has reſigned:—furloughs are not more attended to than if there was no limitation of time:—and in ſhort, ſir, there is ſuch a total depreſſion of that military ardor which I hoped would have inſpired every officer when he found his pay genteelly augmented and the army put upon a reſpectable footing, that it ſeems to me as if all public ſpirit was ſunk * * *</p>
                  <p>I ſhall as ſoon as poſſible tranſmit to the board of war a liſt of the appointments I have made in conſequence of the powers veſted in me.</p>
                  <p>If the appointments in the hoſpital are not filled up before the receipt of this, I would take the liberty of mentioning a gentleman whom I think highly deſerving of notice, not only on account of his abilities, but for the very great aſſiſtance which he has afforded in the courſe of this winter, merely in the nature of a volunteer. The gentlemen is doctor John Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chran, well known to all the faculty, and particularly to doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor Shippen, who, I ſuppoſe, has mentioned him among the can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didates. The place for which the doctor is well fitted, and which will be moſt agreeable to him, is ſurgeon general to the middle department. In this line he ſerved all the laſt war in the Britiſh ſervice, and has diſtinguiſhed himſelf this winter, particularly in his attention to the ſmall-pox patients and the wounded, who, but for him and doctor Bond, muſt have ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed much, if not been totally neglected, as there were no other medical gentlemen to be found.—If the appointment of ſurgeon-general is filled up, that of deputy-director of the middle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment would be acceptable.</p>
                  <p>I have been thus full in my recommendation becauſe doctor Cochran in my manner had my promiſe of one of the capital appointments in the hoſpital, upon a preſumption that I ſhould have had ſome hand in the nomination by the reſolution of Congreſs empowering me to fill all commiſſions under the rank of brigadiers-general.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> 13.—I have this moment received a line from general Lincoln, informing me that the enemy attempted to ſurpriſe him early this morning at his poſt at Boundbrook; but he made good his retreat to the paſs of the mountains juſt in his rear, with trifling loſs.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE nothing of importance to tranſmit Congreſs, no event in the military line having happened ſince my laſt, except the ſurpriſing a ſmall picquet guard of the enemy on monday night at Bonemtown, and bringing off thirteen priſoners by one of our parties. An enterpriſe of a ſimilar nature was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med againſt that at Amboy, in which the party ſent to effect it did not ſucceed ſo well, though the moſt advanced of them ſeized and ſecured three of their out-centuries without giving an alarm.</p>
                  <p>By a letter from general M'Dougal, of yeſterday, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that he had received accounts of thirty-ſix ſail of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports having left Newport on friday laſt, with troops on board. Other reports he had were that a number of ſhips were coming up the ſound, ſo that we may reaſonably conclude general Howe is drawing his forces from the eaſtward. General Arnold, in a letter of the ſixth, mentioned, that, from the preparation of tranſports, and other circumſtances, he thought it probable an embarkation was about to take place.</p>
                  <p>There are grounds to ſuſpect from information received, that ſome unfair practices have been and are meant to be uſed in certain exports from Philadelphia. It is ſaid that a veſſel navi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated by Frenchmen loaded there, belong to * * * of New<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>York, which carried her cargo to general Howe; alſo that * * * and * * * of Monmouth-county intend to load one or more for the ſame purpoſe, under the idea of ſending them to foreign markets. I have written to the board of war for Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania upon the ſubject, and doubt not but theſe hints will be
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:031423_0344_0FEC5CB1B3944CC8"/>
properly improved, and ſuch frauds guarded againſt as well as circumſtances will admit.</p>
                  <p>I have incloſed a copy of an advertiſement publiſhed in Gaine's paper of the fourteenth, which ſhews that no artifices are left untried by the enemy to injure us. Before the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of this unparralleled piece, I had heard that a perſon was gone from York to Rhode-Iſland with a quantity of counterfeit money.</p>
                  <p>There is one thing which I beg leave to mention to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, and which I think highly deſerving their attention, that is, that ſupplies of hard money, or bills of exchange to procure it, ſhould, if poſſible be ſent our priſoners in the hands of the enemy, at leaſt to the officers, to relieve their wants. By let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters which I have received from them of late, I find they are in great diſtreſs, and ſuch as ought to be removed, if it can be done.—No inconvenience will reſult to the public from ſuch ſupplies, if they can be furniſhed, as proper ſtoppages and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions can be made from their pay.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>April</hi> 19.—I was honored with your letter of the ſixteenth between twelve and one o'clock yeſterday, accompanied by ſundry reſolutions. I hope the meaſures Congreſs have adopted will produce the ſalutary conſequences they had in view: but I fear that the ſtates, unleſs they are delicate in exerciſing the powers they are inveſted with for filling vacancies in inſtances of removal from office, and pay ſtrict attention to a proper line of ſucceſſion where there are no capital objections, will renew much of that confuſion and diſorder we have been endeavoring to extricate ourſelves from. Nor will this be of ſmall difficulty if they diſplace many officers: for, ſuppoſing them to have kept the moſt accurate liſts of their original appointments, changes have taken place in ſeveral inſtances from various cauſes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to them, and of which they cannot be appriſed.</p>
                  <p>I can aſſure Congreſs the appellation given to the regiments officered by me was without my conſent or privity. As ſoon as I heard it, I wrote to ſeveral of the officers in terms of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere reprehenſion, and expreſsly charged them to ſuppreſs the diſtinction, adding that all the battalions were on the ſame foot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all under the general name of Continental.</p>
                  <p>An attack upon the king's troops of Rhode-Iſland was cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly a deſirable event, could it have been conducted with ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, or upon equal terms. It being an object of great moment, and involving in its iſſue many important conſequences, I am led to believe the practicability of it has had much conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the meaſure was found to be unadviſable under the
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:031423_0345_0FEC5CB39943D5A0"/>
circumſtances of the troops collected for the purpoſe. If the enemy have not evacuated the Iſland, I ſuppoſe the matter will be further weighed.</p>
                  <p>I do not find in the medical arrangement any mention of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gimental ſurgeons'-mates, or proviſion made for their payment. Whether Congreſs mean to diſpenſe with ſuch officers or not, I cannot tell: I have heard that they do: but they appear to me to be abſolutely neceſſary. We are often obliged to divide re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments and ſend a part to a diſtant poſt: when this is the caſe, it is eſſential that there ſhould be ſome perſon with them to take charge of the ſick or wounded, if ſuch there ſhould be.—I have only mentioned this of many reaſons that might be urged to ſhew the expediency of ſuch appointments.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding the many circumſtances inducing a belief that Philadelphia will be the firſt object of the enemy's atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,—yet, as the ſtratagems of war are various, and they may be eaſily changed, eſpecially when they have the entire com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the water,—I cannot but conſider the detention of the troops at Philadelphia, farther than mentioned in my letter in anſwer to that from the board of war, as expedient, and ſubject to great inconvenience and injury. In the preſent divided, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted ſtate of the army, we are weak at all points, and not able to make the leaſt oppoſition promiſing ſucceſs, Suppoſing they were collected here, they would be ready to act as neceſſity and circumſtances might require. If the enemy puſhed for Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, we ſhould have notice of it, and could hang upon their flank and rear: nor is it likely they would undertake ſuch an expedition without attempting the deſtruction or diſperſion of the army firſt. If they embarked and ſhould go to ſea, we ſhould have information of it, and could be there in time. On the other hand, ſhould all they have done prove a feint, and they ſhould turn their views to the North-river, we ſhould be in a much better ſituation to counteract their deſigns, and to check the progreſs of their arms in that quarter. Added to this, ſeveral of the rigiments, eſpecially thoſe which came firſt from Virginia and Pennſylvania, are ſo broken that it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to do any thing with the parts that are here; and that ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit which is always derived from a corps being full, or as much ſo as circumſtances of number will admit of, is entirely done away.</p>

                  <p>I WAS this morning honored with your favor of the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tieth, incloſing ſundry proceedings of Congreſs.—The removal of proviſions, &amp;c. from the communication between Brunſwic and Trenton has been pretty well effected already. It was an object early attended to, and what I recommended to the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly of this ſtate as deſerving their interpoſition and aid: but finding that it had not their immediate conſideration, and that they ſeemed to decline interfering in the matter, I directed the quarter-maſter and commiſſaries to purchaſe their firſt ſupplies of thoſe neceſſaries from ſuch places as appeared to be moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to the enemy's incurſions and through which it is moſt probable they will take their route towards the Delaware, in caſe an enterpriſe that way ſhould be in contemplation. I have tranſmitted copies of the reſolve upon this ſubject to general Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam and colonel Forman (the latter of whom is in Monmouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>county), with orders to execute the ſame agreeable to the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections therein preſcribed, where it may be neceſſary on the road leading from South-Amboy acroſs the country.</p>
                  <p>I have nothing of importance to communicate to Congreſs.

                  <p>The money and bill for our priſoners had better be tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Elias Boudinot, eſquire, to whom I ſhall give directions to adopt ways and means for ſending the ſame, and for a proper appropriation and diſtribution of the money amongſt them. Bills, I think will be moſt eligible, provided they are duly paid. As to procuring clothes in New-York, I have reaſon to believe that it will not be allowed, and that the priſoners will obtain no ſupplies but what we ſend them.</p>
                  <p>I heard of Mr. Franklin's practices ſome time ago, and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed governor Trumbull of the ſame, that his conduct might be properly attended to. It is very unhappy for us, that, through the intrigues of ſuch men, the enemy have found means to raiſe a ſpirit of diſaffection but too generally in many of the ſtates. In this, I have ſtrong aſſurances that it has ariſen to a great heigth; and I ſhall not be diſappointed if a large number of the inhabitants in ſome of the counties ſhould openly appear in arms as ſoon as the enemy begin their operations. I have taken every meaſure in my power to ſuppreſs it; but neverthe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſeveral from Sussex and Bergan have joined their army, and the ſpirit becomes more and more daring every day.</p>
                  <p>You will be pleaſed to direct general Miſſlin to remain in Philadelphia as long as Congreſs ſhall think his preſence there eſſential.</p>
                  <p>I have inlcoſed a copy of general Howe's letter which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived laſt night in anſwer to mine of the ninth inſtant.</p>
                  <p>Nothing of an intereſting nature has occurred ſince my laſt: which leaves me only to add, that I have the honor to be, with ſentiments of the greateſt reſpect, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>I LAST night received the favor of your letter of the twenty-ſixth, with the reſolves to which it alludes.</p>
                  <p>The views of Congreſs, in ſending general officers to the eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to haſten on the troops, have been long antiſcipated: ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Poor is in New-Hampſhire for the purpoſe,—general Heath in Maſſachuſetts-Bay, with the brigadiers, Nixon Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:031423_0348_0FEC5CBB67409968"/>
and Patterſon,—general Varnum in Rhode-Iſland, and ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Parſons in Connecticut. Generals Spencer and Arnold too have been deſired to attend to the buſineſs. To theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen I have wrote repeatedly in the moſt preſſing terms upon the ſubject, and I have no reaſon to doubt but every exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion on their part has been employed to promote the end. The delay of thoſe who have enliſted has ariſen from the late pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod when they engaged, and from their being inoculated ſince, which could not be diſpenſed with, without ſubjecting them to the calamities and ravage of the ſmall-pox in the natural way.</p>
                  <p>At three o'clock this morning I received a letter from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral M'Dougal incloſing three from colonel Huntington, copies of the whole of which I have tranſmitted. By theſe, you will perceive the impreſſion which a part of general Howe's army has made into Connecticut, and the proſpect they had of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying ſuch of our ſtores as were depoſited in Danbury, which unfortunately were but too large and conſiderable, if the event has taken place. A circumſtance, perhaps more to be regret<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, is that the enemy marched through a ſtrong and rough country, and were near that place, without the ſmalleſt oppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. I have no other information upon the ſubject than what theſe papers contain: but we have little ground to expect that they have not accompliſhed their purpoſe. Further intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence will be probably received to-day or to-morrow, when I ſhall be happy to hear that they have paid for their enterpriſe. Of this, I confeſs however, I am not very ſanguine in my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations.</p>
                  <p>This poſt had been conſidered as a proper depoſitory for ſtores, by gentlemen, acquinted with it; and its ſecurity not thought queſtionable whilſt troops were paſſing through it. I had alſo directed that as many of the draughts in Connecticut as the place was capable of accommodating, ſhould be collected there and inoculated, to anſwer the purpoſe of a guard, hoping, by the time of their recovery, that the ſituation of the army would be ſuch as to admit a ſtrong one to be ſtationed there, and continued; but, unhappily for us, ſuch languor and ſupine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs prevails every where, that we ſeem unable to effect any point we wiſh, though never ſo important and intereſting. So early as the ſixth of March, I wrote to governor Trumbull, earneſtly requeſting two thouſand militia to be ſent to general M'Dougal to be employed at Peekſkill and on the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation in Weſt-Cheſter county for ſix weeks. With this requi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition he moſt readily complied ſo far as his orders were neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary,
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:031423_0349_0FEC5CBFCECEB5E0"/>
and (I am certain) his influence would extend. This I have repeated, and this ſupply he has exerted himſelf to furniſh: yet ſo ineffectual have his endeavors been, that not more than eight hundred had come out, by general M'Dougal's return on the ſeventeenth inſtant; nor did he expect more, from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts he had. In a word, ſir, no expedient or pains have been un-attempted by me to bring on troops, and to keep our affairs on a favorable footing.</p>
                  <p>I would again mention the caſe of our priſoners with the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and pray that the ſecret committee would ſend to Mr. Bou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinot ſupplies of money for them as early as poſſible. They are in great diſtreſs, and many officers have lately eſcaped, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the tenor of their parole; ſome of whom are now here, urging that neceſſity compelled them to the meaſure.</p>

                  <p>I WAS yeſterſtay honored with your letter of the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ninth ultimo, incloſing ſundry reſolves.—Agreeable to the directions of Congreſs, I have written to the ſtates of New-Hampſhire and Maſſachuſetts, and urged them to complete and forward their troops deſtined for Ticonderoga, with all poſſible expedition. The brigadiers gone there for the preſent are Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moy, Poor, Patterſon, and Learned. Nixon and Glover were alſo intended for that poſt under my firſt plan, which was, that all the regiments to be raiſed in thoſe ſtates by the reſolve in September, ſhould compoſe that army. But having by the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of my officers directed the route of eight regiments from
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:031423_0350_0FEC5CC402165128"/>
the latter to Peekſkill, to wait till the deſigns of general Howe were unfolded, theſe two officers were to follow them.—I did not particulariſe the brigadiers who were to go firſt, or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments; but left the matter to major-general Heath, who was inſtructed in general terms to purſue ſuch meaſures as ſeemed moſt likely to promote the ſervice.</p>
                  <p>The colonels appointed to the New-Hamſhire regiments I never knew. Thoſe ordered to Ticonderoga from Maſſachu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetts by general Heath, and who I preſume have marched, were Bailey, Weſſon, Jackſon, Marſhall, Brewer, Bradford, and Francis. What proportions of their regiments have marched, I cannot aſcertain: but I am perſuaded they were detached as faſt as they were raiſed, and circumſtances would admit. Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cis's, the firſt of April, was returned five hundred ſtrong; and, by a letter from colonel Marſhall about the fifteenth of laſt month, he expected to march in a day or two with the laſt di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion of his regiment that was ready, which would make about four hundred, including thoſe who had gone. The remainder (about ſixty) were to follow with the proper officers as ſoon as they were fit,—the having been inoculated.</p>
                  <p>I have written to generals M'Dougal and Clinton to have the proviſion removed from Derby, &amp;c. and directed that they ſhould point out proper places for its reception in Ulſter; alſo that ſmall works and guards of militia will be eſſential for its protection. * * *</p>
                  <p>The damage we ſuſtained at Danbury, nor the enemy's loſs, have not been tranſmitted with any accuracy: but, from the lateſt accounts from thence, the former was not ſo great, and and the latter more conſiderable, than was apprehended at firſt.</p>
                  <p>I congratulate Congreſs upon the fortunate arrival of the Amphitrite with military and ordnance ſtores:—it is an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant event. That of the French ſhip at Boſton, and of the ſloop from Martinique, added to the capture of the two provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſhips, are to be regarded as intereſting too. I would here take the liberty to mention that I think all the military and ordnance ſtores ſhould be moved without a moment's delay to Springfield or ſome interior part of the country. Springfield ſhould be the place, becauſe the elaboratory is there, and they will be more convenient to uſe as exigencies require. In their preſent ſituation their ſecurity is queſtionable; and, if an attack ſhould be made in the eaſtern quarter, their loſs is much to be apprehended. Before I quit this ſubject, I would beg leave to obſerve alſo that the diſpoſal and direction of military ſtores
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:031423_0351_0FEC5CC8054A5308"/>
ſhould be only with one body or with one perſon. At preſent this power is exerciſed through ſo many channels, that much confuſion is introduced; and it cannot be avoided: nor will it be poſſible that matters in this line ſhould be conducted with any degree of propriety, unleſs Congreſs come into ſome regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations reſpecting them. The incloſed extract of a letter from general Heath will prove the expediency. Many other in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſtances might be mentioned, were it neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>The deſertions from our army of late has been very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able. General Howe's proclamation, and the bounty allowed to thoſe who carry in their arms, have had an unhappy influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on two many of the ſoldiery; in a particular manner on thoſe who are not natives. * * *</p>
                  <p>I could wiſh ſome means could be deviſed to cauſe more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent deſertions of [<hi>the enemy's</hi>] troops. Congreſs may think of ſome expedient: a larger bounty might have ſome effect, and money to the foreigners in lieu of land. The bounty given by general Howe to thoſe who carry in arms, is ſixteen dollars as we are told, though his proclamation only expreſſes that they ſhall have the full value. To the inhabitants who will take up arms and join him, he promiſes land.</p>

                  <p>I WAS this morning honored with your letter of the third inſtant, with its incloſures.—General Arnold's promotion gives me much pleaſure. He has certainly diſcovered in every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance where he has had an opportunity, much bravery, activity, and enterpriſe. But what will be done about his rank?—he will not act moſt probably under thoſe he commanded but a few weeks ago.</p>
                  <p>I truſt the appointment of Mr. Ludwick as ſuperintendant of bakers will have the ſalutary conſequence you mention; I have been long aſſured that many abuſes have been committed for want of ſome proper regulations in that department.</p>
                  <p>By major Troop, one of general Gates's aides, and who left Albany on tueſday laſt, I am informed the accounts of general Carleton's approach towards Ticonderoga were premature. He ſays general Gates received a letter before he came away, from brigadier-general Wayne, of the twenty-fourth ult. in which he mentioned nothing of it;—that three thouſand troops had arrived there, all in high ſpirits and health, except nine;—and
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:031423_0352_0FEC5CCB756EA278"/>
that that poſt could never be carried without the loſs of much blood. The proceedings of Congreſs and your letter of the twenty-ninth ultimo were the firſt and only information I had of Mr. Carleton's being on the lake, having heard nothing upon the ſubject from general Gates or any other perſon.</p>
                  <p>In my laſt I mentioned that ſixteen dollars bounty were given by general Howe to deſerters with arms. I have reaſon to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve from information received ſince, and which ſeems to be generally credited, that he has advanced the bounty to twenty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>four dollars.</p>
                  <p>It is much to be wiſhed that our printers were more diſcreet in many of their publications. We ſee, almoſt in every paper, proclamations or accounts tranſmitted by the enemy, of an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious nature. If ſome hint or caution could be given them on the ſubject, it might be of material ſervice.</p>
                  <p>By a perſon who has juſt arrived here, it is reported that general Wooſter is dead of his wounds.</p>
                  <p>I would mention to Congreſs that in a day or two our military cheſt will be exhauſted. I beg that a ſupply may be forwarded as ſoon as poſſible: if there ſhould be a failure, we ſhall have many things to apprehend.</p>

                  <p>THIS will be delivered you by colonel Conway, an Iriſh gentleman in the ſervice of France, who came paſſenger in the Amphitrite, and was introduced to me yeſterday by a letter from Mr. Deane and one from general Heath, copies of which are tranſmitted.</p>
                  <p>This gentleman waits on Congreſs to obtain an appointment in the army of the ſtates, and, from Mr. Deane's recommen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation, is an officer of merit. He ſays no particular command was agreed on between him and Mr. Deane; nor does he wiſh otherwiſe than that Congreſs ſhould exerciſe their own diſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; at the ſame time he obſerves that it will be mortifying to
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:031423_0353_0FEC5CCE996A64B8"/>
him to hold a rank under that of meſſieurs De Fermoy and De Borre, who were inferior officers in their own ſervice, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to his command.—He can give the character of ſeveral of the officers who were paſſengers with him.</p>

I ſhould ſuppoſe him infinitely better qualified to ſerve us, than many who have been promoted, as he ſpeaks our language. He ſeems extremely anxious to return to camp, as the campaign may be expected to become active every day; and wiſhes Congreſs to determine whatever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand they may think proper to honor him with, as ſoon as they ſhall think it expedient.</p>

                  <p>THE incloſed is a copy of a letter which was handed to me by monſieur Mottin de la Balme, from Silas Deane, eſquire. For a more particular account of his merit and ſervices, I muſt refer you to himſelf. I have ſounded him as to his expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and find that nothing under a lieutenant-colonelcy of horſe will content him. If you ſhould, from his own account, or from what you can collect from others, think proper to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer this rank upon him, there is no vacancy in any other corps except that of colonel Sheldon.</p>
                  <p>I am afraid we ſhall never be able to find places vacant, equal to the expectations of the French gentlemen who are now her<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, much leſs for thoſe that will follow. The high rank conferred upon thoſe who firſt came over, many of whom had no preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions either from their ſervices or merit, has naturally raiſed the expectations of thoſe who come properly recommended, to ſuch a pitch, that I know not what will ſatisfy them. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed it is not to be imagined that a gentleman and an old ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier can ſubmit to be commanded by a perſon in this country, whom he remembers to have been his inferior in France. I know not how we can remedy this evil, or put a ſtop to the growth of it, but by being very circumſpect for the future, on whom we confer rank above that of a ſubaltern.</p>

                  <p>SINCE I had the honor of addreſſing you on the fifth inſtant, nothing material has occurred.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed you will be pleaſed to receive a general return of our forces in Jerſey, the ſixth inſtant, which is the firſt I have been able to obtain with any degree of accuracy.</p>
                  <p>I have not heard from general De Haas ſince his promotion. As ſoon as I was informed of it, I wrote and requeſted him to repair to camp: but, having received no anſwer, I am appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſive my letter miſcarried. I wiſh Congreſs to give him no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his appointment, and directions to join the army, if he accepts his commiſſion and is not prevented by indiſpoſition.</p>
                  <p>Through the board of war I have been favored with a copy of general Gate's letter of the twenty-ninth ultimo. Hudſon's<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>river and the paſſes in the Highlands I always conſider as ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of great importance, and accordingly have provided for their ſecurity in the beſt manner my judgment could direct, and the circumſtances of the army admit. If they are leſs ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure than we wiſh them to be, it is owing to our inability and not to inattention. I have written to general M'Dougal, and will do it again, to employ much of his care upon this ſubject. War, in theory, and the modes of defence, are obvious and eaſy; but, in practice, they are more difficult. Unhappily for us, the means in our power do not always accord with our wiſhes or what would be our intereſt to purſue.</p>
                  <p>As yet none of the eaſtern troops have paſſed the North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>river, except two ſmall detachments from Connecticut and Rhode-Iſland, amounting to about two hundred and ſeventy, which miſſed my orders till they had got over. Theſe I ſhall ſend back after we are more reinforced, unleſs the movements of the enemy in this quarter make their detention neceſſary. The reſt of the eaſtern troops which have marched (except the ſeven regiments from Maſſachuſetts and three from New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, ordered immediately to Ticonderoga) are at and on their way to Peekſkill, as mentioned in my letter of the third,—where they are to remain with all the York troops except Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſchaick's and Ganſevoorts now at the northward, till general Howe's deſigns and intended operations are better underſtood. This diſpoſition appearing to me and my general officers the beſt that could be made in our ſtate of uncertainty, was adopted. The two troops of horſe, recommended by Congreſs to be ſent to general Gates, ſhall go as ſoon as circumſtances will admit. At preſent we have not more than are conſtantly employed at the different poſts.</p>

General Heath, in a letter of the thirtieth ultimo, mentions that the military cheſt at the eaſtward is exhauſted, and that a ſupply will be wanted much to defray the expenſes which will ariſe on the removal of the military and ordnance ſtores to Springfield. He ſays Mr. Hancock was to write upon the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and requeſted I would alſo mention it to Congreſs in my firſt letter.</p>
                  <p>Accounts have been frequently exhibited of late by the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers, reſpecting ſubſiſtence while recruiting and on their march. As I do not recollect the proviſion Congreſs have made in ſuch caſes, I wiſh to be informed, and to be favored with a copy of their ſeveral reſolves upon the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>A conſideration of the return tranſmitted, and of the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral detachments that have joined, and which form it, will ſhew Congreſs what our ſituation has been.</p>

                  <p>THIS will be delivered you by general Arnold who ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived here to-day in his way to Philadelphia. He ſeems to be anxious to ſettle his public accounts which are of conſiderable amount, and waits on Congreſs, hoping they will appoint a committee of their body, or of ſuch gentlemen as they ſhall judge proper, to take the matter into conſideration. This he conſiders the more neceſſary, as he has heard ſome reports have been propagated, injurious to his character as a man of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity. If any ſuch aſperſions lie againſt him, it is but reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able he ſhould have an opportunity of vindicating himſelf and evincing his innocence.</p>
                  <p>I find he does not conſider the promotion Congreſs have been pleaſed to confer upon him ſufficient to obviate the neglect ariſing from their having omitted him in their late appointments of major-generals. He obſerves it does not give him the rank he had a claim to from ſeniority in the line of brigadiers, and that he is ſubject to be commanded by thoſe who had been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferior to him. He further adds, that Congreſs, in their laſt reſolve reſpecting him, have acknowledged him competent to the ſtation of major-general, and therefore have done away every objection implied by their former omiſſion. Theſe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations are not without their weight, though I pretend not to judge what motives may have influenced the conduct of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs upon this occaſion.

                  <p>I WAS this morning honored with your letter of the tenth inſtant, accompanied by the proceedings of Congreſs of the day before.</p>
                  <p>The conduct of too many officers in withholding the pay of their ſoldiers, I am perſuaded, is reprehenſible, and has been the cauſe of uneaſineſs and of many deſertions. Every meaſure in my power will be exerted to prevent ſuch abuſes in future, and every aid given to puniſh the offenders in an exemplary manner. But Congreſs will excuſe me when I tell them it will be impoſſible to comply with their recommendation upon this ſubject, unleſs the general officers withdraw their attention from matters of the utmoſt importance, and ſuch as require their conſtant care. Were this not the caſe, the diſperſed ſituation of the officers at this time through the different ſtates on the recruiting ſervice would prohibit the enquiry. Nor do I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend the regulations empowering and enjoining the regimen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal paymaſters to bring them to an account will be found com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to the end. Such officers will be proper to ſtate the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts in the firſt inſtance, and to receive vouchers, &amp;c. but will not do to ſettle them finally, as their connexions with the regiments will ſubject them much to the influence of the of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould ſuppoſe, if two or three gentlemen of integrity, and of ability in accounts, were appointed auditors to attend the army till the buſineſs is finiſhed, it would be the beſt expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient that could be fallen on. They would be a check on the paymaſters, and, I am perſuaded, will be the means of the accounts being fairly and juſtly liquidated. If a ſettlement can be once obtained, I truſt the ſame confuſion will never take place again, as the paymaſters will receive and pay all money due to the regiments, and account for it, and as the army is on a more permanent footing than it ever was before: for this, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>A return of the army in Jerſey, as late as the ſixth inſtant,
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:031423_0357_0FEC5CD5ED101648"/>
I tranſmitted yeſterday morning in a letter by Mr. Randolph of Cheſnut-ſtreet, which you will probably receive to-day, and from which Congreſs will be able to determine the expediency of calling out the militia from Delaware and Pennſylvania.—Though it gives me pain that we ſhould be under the neceſſity of recurring to ſuch a meaſure, yet I ſhould ſuppoſe it to be adviſable. Our army is weak, and by no means equal to that of the enemy; and, till their deſigns are known and we are more reinforced with regular troops, we ſhould be prepared in the beſt manner we can. I would obſerve, if the militia are called out, it ſhould be for a fixed determinate time: for, though they will certainly return when that expires, yet that is more tolerable than for them to go off in parties every day as their whim and caprice ſuggeſt,—which has always been the caſe when the time was not ſtated. I would alſo obſerve, if it is poſſible, they ſhould be engaged to march out of their ſtates if ordered. If their ſervice is located, they will move with great reluctance, if they do at all.</p>
                  <p>On ſaturday a ſmart ſkirmiſh happened with a detachment of our troops who attached a number of the enemy near Piſcata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wa, in which our men behaved well, and obliged the enemy to give way twice (as reported to me) with loſs. The enemy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving a ſtrong reinforcement, our people retreated to their poſt.—I cannot give the particulars, as they have not been ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently aſcertained. The picquets were alſo attacked yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day by ſome of our parties from Boundbrook, and forced within their lines.</p>

                  <p>YOUR letter of the fifteenth I had the honor to receive laſt night at eleven o'clock.—The commiſſion incloſed for mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Armand I ſhall deliver him as ſoon as I ſee him—Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to your requeſt, I will give commiſſions to the brigadiers, and will aſcertain their rank by their original commiſſions when I obtain them.—The inquiry directed reſpecting major Campbell, ſhall be made, and that be done which ſhall appear right.</p>
                  <p>I fear it will be hardly poſſible to ſatisfy the views and claims of ſome of the French gentlemen. The late promotion of monſieur Malmady, though highly honorable, and ſuch as ſhould be conſidered fully if not more than adequate to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:031423_0358_0FEC5CDA1B147AD8"/>
taken upon any principle, does not come up to his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. He arrived here yeſterday morning, and has been writing to me upon the ſubject. From the high marks of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction but too readily conferred upon theſe men in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, they ſeem to have loſt ſight of what is juſt and reaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. It would have been happy for us, particularly for me and for the gentlemen themſelves, if a too eaſy grant of favors had not induced them to contemn all rank in our army under that of field-officers:—nor is it in my power to give commands to every appointment. I ſhall inform monſieur Armand (and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile him to it in the beſt manner I can) that there is no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cancy for him at preſent: and I would beg leave to ſuggeſt, that, where promotions are made in future from political and honorary motives, it would be well for Congreſs to explain to the gentlemen that it may be ſome time before they can be put in actual command. This might prevent their entertaining ſuſpicions of neglect on my part, which the ſituation of the army will not allow me to obviate. There is no vacancy for mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Malmady, of the rank he now holds, unleſs the merits of many other officers, who have ſerved with reputation and much longer here, are to be overlooked to make may for him.—Such a meaſure will neither be practicable, nor prudent to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt.</p>
                  <p>By a letter from general Heard who is at Pompton, I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that colonels Barton and Burſkirk with three hundred tory levies from Bergen, on the morning of the thirteenth, at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to ſurpriſe and cut off about ſeventy of his militia ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned at Pyramus. The officer happily had notice of their deſign, and eluded it by moving his poſt. It happened that the morning was foggy; and the enemy entering at different places, their parties engaged. General Heard ſays their loſs could not be aſcertained: but, from the reports of the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, ten of their men were killed and carried away at one time, and ſeveral wounded.</p>

                  <p>I BEG leave to inform Congreſs, that, immediately after the receipt of their reſolve of the twenty-ſixth of March, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending the office of adjutant-general to be filled by the appointent of a perſon of abilities and unſuſpected attachment to our cauſe, I wrote to colonel Timothy Pickering of Salem, offering him the poſt in the firſt inſtance, and tranſmitting at the ſame time a letter for colonel William Lee whom Congreſs had been pleaſed to mention, to be delivered him in caſe my offer could not be accepted. This conduct, in preference of colonel Pickering, I was induced to adopt from the high cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter I had of him, both as a great military genius cultivated by an induſtrious attention to the ſtudy of war, and as a gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of liberal education, diſtinguiſhed zeal, and great method and activity in buſineſs. This character of him I had from gentlemen of diſtinction and merit, and on whoſe judgment I could rely.</p>
                  <p>When my letter reached colonel Pickering, at firſt view he thought his ſituation in reſpect to public affairs would not permit him to accept the poſt. That for colonel Lee he ſent immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to him, who, in conſequence of it, repaired to head-quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. By colonel Lee I received a letter from colonel Pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ering, ſtating more particularly the cauſes which prevented him accepting the office when it was offered, and aſſuring me that he would in a little time accommodate his affairs in ſuch a manner as to come into any military poſt in which he might be ſervice<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, and thought equal to.</p>
                  <p>Here I am to mark with peculiar ſatisfaction, in juſtice to colonel Lee who has deſervedly acquired the reputation of a good officer, that he expreſſed a diſtruſt of his abilities to fill the appointment intended for him; and, on hearing that colonel Pickering would accept it, he not only offered but wiſhed to relinquiſh his claim to it in favor of him, whom he declared he conſidered, from a very intimate and friendly acquaintance, as
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:031423_0360_0FEC5CE471809B80"/>
a firſt military character; and that he knew no gentleman bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter or ſo well qualified for the poſt among us.—Matters being thus circumſtanced, and colonel Lee pleaſed with the command he was in, I wrote to colonel Pickering on his return, who ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted the office, and is daily expected.</p>
                  <p>In this buſineſs I beg Congreſs to be aſſured, though colonel Lee was poſtponed in the firſt inſtance, their recommendation had its due weight; and that no motive, other than a regard to the ſervice, induced me to prefer colonel Pickering. His acknowledged abilities and equal zeal,—without derogating from the merits of colonel Lee who holds a high place in my eſteem,—gave him a preference: and I flatter myſelf the cauſe will be promoted in his appointment, eſpecially as we ſhall have two good officers in lieu of one, who, I am per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, will do honor to themſelves in the line in which they move.</p>
                  <p>Conſidering the paſſes through the Highlands of the utmoſt importance to ſecure, I ſent generals Greene and Knox about a fortnight ago to ſee what had been done for their defence, and to conſult with the general officers they ſhould meet, upon ſuch further meaſures as might be deemed neceſſary for their greater ſafety. The incloſed copy of their report will fully convey their ſentiments upon the ſubject; to which I beg leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer Congreſs.—I have ſent General Putnam to command in that quarter, and have inſtructed him to uſe every poſſible means in his power for expediting and effecting the works and obſtructions mentioned in the report. Fearing that the cables might not be procured in a time, I have directed his particular and immediate attention to fixing the boom. However, as the cables would render that more ſecure, and will be extremely ſerviceable in the opinion of the officers,—if they are <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>o be had in Philadelphia, I would adviſe Congreſs to order them to be purchaſed and forwarded without loſs of time:—they cannot be got elſewhere. They muſt be proportioned to the width of the river, which is about five hundred and forty yards; and, as they will be of moſt uſe if diagonally laid, the gentlemen think they ſhould not be leſs than four hundred and fifty fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoms long, and of the largeſt ſize that can be had. Unleſs they are large and ſubſtantial, they will anſwer no purpoſe, and will not ſuſtain their weight when ſtretched.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould be glad to know whether it be the intention of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs that one of the already-appointed general officers may be aſſigned to the command of the light-horſe, or whether they have in contemplation the appointing of one for this purpoſe:
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:031423_0361_0FEC5CE618575E78"/>
—if the firſt, I ſhall immediately name one to that duty;—if the ſecond, they will be pleaſed to chooſe one, as it is time we ſhould have our arrangements complete.</p>
                  <p>I have nothing of importance to communicate, unleſs it is that ſeventeen ſhips are ſaid to have arrived at New-York on the twenty-ſecond, and that others were in the offing. A re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port has alſo prevailed, and has come through two or three channels, that governor Tryon (that was) is dead of the wound he received in the Danbury expedition: and one account is that lieutenant-colonel Walcot fell in the engagement at Ridgefield. I do not know how far the facts are to be depended on:—it ſeems certain that Mr. Tryon was wounded.</p>

                  <p>THE incloſed is a copy of a letter received yeſterday from general Howe. Congreſs will perceive, by referring to the copy of his letter of the twenty-firſt of April tranſmitted in mine of the twenty-ſixth, that he perſevered in his demand for an equal number of priſoners to be returned for thoſe ſent out by him; which has been the ſubject of controverſy between us. As general Howe has called upon me again for my final deciſion upon the ſubject, and Congreſs are fully poſſeſſed of it, having received tranſcripts of every paper reſpecting it,—I wiſh them to take the matter under their earlieſt conſideration, and to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form me as ſoon as they can, whether the grounds on which it has been conducted by me are agreeable to their ideas, and whether my objections are or are not to be departed from. The affair is particularly ſtated in my letter of the ninth ultimo to general Howe, in anſwer to the paper addreſſed to me by lieutenant-colonel Walcot; copies of which were incloſed in my letter to the preſident on the tenth of the ſame month. The deſpute, ſo fat as general Lee is concerned, reſts at preſent on their declaring him exchangeable, as other priſoners are, on
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:031423_0362_0FEC5CE7E78E6378"/>
the principle of equality of rank; to enſure which, or his ſafety, lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the Heſſian field-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers are detained. The other objection to returning their pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners is, that a great proportion of thoſe ſent out by them were not fit ſubjects of exchange when releaſed, and were made ſo by the ſeverity of their treatment and confinement, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore a deduction ſhould be made from the liſt.</p>
                  <p>Good faith ſeems to require that we ſhould return as many of theirs at leaſt as we received effectives from them,—I mean ſuch as could be conſidered capable of being exchanged; and perhaps ſound policy, that the agreement ſubſiſting for ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes ſhould continue. On the other hand it may be ſaid that our priſoners in general, in the enemy's hands at preſent, will have greater ſecurity by our retaining them, and that ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Howe will be leſs apt to relinquiſh any part of his claim, the more the number in our hands is diminiſhed by an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs I am under great difficulty in this buſineſs. But what is more particularly the cauſe of this application is the latter part of the firſt paragraph of the incloſed copy,—"<hi>and for your determination reſpecting the priſoners now here, that I may make my arrangements accordingly.</hi>"—This is couched in terms of great ambiguity; and I am really at a loſs what inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretation to give it,—whether he intends that his conduct re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting them ſhall be as I adviſe—(this appears more favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than can well be expected),—or that, if the previous de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand is not anſwered in a ſatisfactory manner, he ſhall conſider them on a different footing from that on which our former priſoners were, and the agreement totally diſſolved. We are told government offered the priſoners they took to the India company, and they have procured an act diſpenſing with that of the habeas-corpus in particular caſes of perſons ſuppoſed inimical to them, &amp;c. How far they or their commanders may adopt theſe meaſures, remains to be known:—I have only mentioned them as they reſpect the general ſubject of my letter.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding my recommendation agreeable to what I conceived to be the ſenſe of Congreſs, lieutenant-colonel Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell's treatment continues to be ſuch as cannot be juſtified ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on the principles of generoſity, or ſtrict retaliation; as I have authentic information, and I doubt not you will have the ſame, that general Lee's ſituation is far from being rigorous or uncomfortable:—except his not being permitted to go at large
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:031423_0363_0FEC5CEECB89A8B8"/>
on parole, he has reaſon to be content with every other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of his treatment.</p>
                  <p>I am juſt moving to Boundbrook, from whence I returned yeſterday morning. On monday morning a body of the enemy advanced near that poſt. They retreated, on ſeeing a detach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment march to meet them. There was ſome firing at long ſhot, but without any great damage. We had only three men ſlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wounded. What their loſs was, I know not: three of their light-horſe were killed.—By advices from the eaſtward, the troops are coming from Rhode-Iſland.</p>

                  <p>SINCE I did myſelf the honor to write to you the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ninth, I have received the incloſed intelligence. As it comes from a perſon of veracity, and one who is much in the confidence of the enemy, I have no doubt as to the fact of the two brigades having come over from New-York to Amboy, and alſo that a number of waggons have been brought from Staten and Long-Iſland. Theſe accounts are corroborated by informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſame kind from ſeveral different quarters. But I do not place ſo much dependence upon the account of the intended at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:031423_0364_0FEC5CF060150340"/>
upon this place, becauſe I think, if ſuch a matter was really in agitation, it would be kept a profound ſecret: I rather am of opinion that it is thrown out to deceive. But at any rate, taking it for granted that they are aſſembling their troops and carriages, what can they have in view but a move, either imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately, or when their reinforcement, (if they get any) arrives? and if they do move, I can ſee no other object but Philadelphia. It is true they have ſeemed for ſome time paſt to have laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide all thoughts of attempting that city by land: but if they had only the attacking this army in contemplation, they would never encumber themſelves with a large train of waggons, which, if they were ſucceſsful, would retard them in their pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit, and, if defeated, would be in danger of falling into our hands.</p>
                  <p>I incloſe you an extract of a letter which I received from general Sullivan.—If the two India ſhips which have been cut down are gone out to ſea, I ſhould ſuppoſe they are intended for the Delaware, becauſe they are not capable of performing a rough or long voyage. This, if true, looks as if a ſudden cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponding move by land was intended; for they will never ſend their ſhips long before their troops.</p>
                  <p>Theſe, you will pleaſe to obſerve, are mere conjectures upon circumſtances: for the actions of the the enemy have for a long time paſt been ſo different from appearances, that I hardly dare to form an opinion. But I would wiſh to profit by every piece of intelligence, and be prepared to ward off every danger that threatens. I would therefore recommend that the Pennſylvania militia, who are aſſembled at Briſtol for the expreſs purpoſe of guarding the river and opoſing the paſſage of the enemy, ſhould be put under the command of a good general officer, who would ſee that they are kept to their duty, and prepared for a ſudden emergency. Except this is done, they may as well be at home.</p>
                  <p>I laſt night received a letter from general M'Dougal, an extract of which you have incloſed. By this it appears that a reinforcement is arrived, but whether from Canada or Europe, is uncertain. You will obſerve that he likewiſe mentions, that eight tranſports with foot, and a ſchooner with horſes and hay, had fallen down.—We can only form conjectures at preſent of the place of their deſtination: but if they ſtand ſouthward, Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia is the moſt probable place.</p>
                  <p>I have the pleaſure to communicate a very agreeable piece of intelligence which I have received from general Parſons, of the deſtruction of twelve of the enemy's veſſels in Sag-harbor
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:031423_0365_0FEC5CF4F9444358"/>
upon the eaſt end of Long-Iſland. I give you his letter at length, which I think reflects high honor upon the conduct and bravery of colonel Meigs, his officers, and men.</p>

                  <p>MONSIEUR Coudray is juſt arrived at camp, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes to ſet out to-morrow for Philadelphia. What his views are, I am uncertain, having had no converſation with him upon the ſubject: but I find an idea prevails that there is an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment between Mr. Deane and him. that he ſhall have the chief command of the artillery. How well founded this opinion may be, I cannot determine: but if it be true, it may involve the moſt injurious conſequences. General Knox, who has deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly acquired the character of one of the moſt valuable offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers in the ſervice, and who, combating almoſt innumerable difficulties in the department he fills, has placed the artillery upon a footing that does him the greateſt honor,—he, I am perſuaded, would conſider himſelf injured by an appointment ſuperceding his command, and would not think himſelf at liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to continue in the ſervice. Should ſuch an event take place in the preſent ſtate of things, there would be too much reaſon to apprehend a train of ills, ſuch as might convulſe and unhinge this important department.</p>
                  <p>Suppoſing monſieur Coudray to have made ſuch an agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the caſe is of great difficulty, and, in my opinion, is wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of the moſt delicate conſideration of Congreſs. Yet may not means be ſtill deviſed to ſatisfy this gentleman by appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to ſome command not derogatory to his promiſed rank, and which will be agreeable to him? From the recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we have had of him. I am obliged to eſteem him of high character, and of great knowledge in what he profeſſes: and, from this conſideration and the manner in which he is mentioned to us, it appears that much addreſs and delicacy muſt be uſed, to conciliate matters.</p>
                  <p>Many reaſons, beſides thoſe I have noted, might be aſſigned for continuing general Knox firſt in command in this depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which, on reflection, will readily occur. I would only obſerve, without inſinuating the moſt diſtant ſhadow of diſtruſt of monſieur Coudray's honor, candor, or integrity, that, on the general maxims of prudence and policy, it may be queſtioned with much propriety whether ſo important a command as that
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:031423_0366_0FEC5CF8C4EDF680"/>
of the artillery ſhould be veſted in any but a native, or one at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached by the ties of intereſt to theſe ſtates.</p>
                  <p>Congreſs will be pleaſed to excuſe the freedom I have uſed upon this occaſion, and, I truſt, will impute it to the impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the ſubject which gave riſe to it.</p>

I wiſh our accounts from that quarter may be happy, if Mr. Carleton makes an attack.—The ſhameful deficiency in all our armies affords but too juſt grounds for diſagreeable apprehenſions: if the quotas aſſigned the different ſtates are not immediately filled we ſhall have every thing to fear. We ſhall never be able to reſiſt their force, if the militia are to be relied on; nor do I know whether their aid, feeble and ineffectual as it is, is much to be expected.—Can no expedients be deviſed to complete the regiments, and to rouſe our unthinking countrymen from their lethargy?—If there can, the ſituation of our affairs calls loudly for it.</p>

                  <p>I WOULD take the liberty of addreſſing a few lines to Congreſs on a matter which appears to me of importance, and which is conſidered in the ſame light by many of our officers, and others not in the military line.—The ſubject I allude to is the condition of many perſons now with the enemy, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded by their arts and a miſguided attachment to their mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, fled from the protection of the ſtates, to find ſecurity
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:031423_0367_0FEC5BEA65EBBF98"/>
with them, and who, in many inſtances, are in arms againſt us.</p>
                  <p>It has been ſuggeſted through various channels,—and the ſuggeſtion ſeems to be credited, eſpecially as ſome have already eſcaped,—that many of theſe unhappy people, convinced of their error and the wicked part they have taken, would embrace the earlieſt opportunity of leaving the enemy and returning a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us were they ſure of being received into our friendſhip again, and of enjoying their property and the rights of citizens.</p>
                  <p>This ſubject, in the conſideration of it, ſtrikes me as impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, intereſting, and delicate,—involving many conſequences worthy of mature deliberation and attention. As ſuch,—and, deeming myſelf incompetent to it,—I think it my duty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to Congreſs for their diſcuſſion, to take ſuch meaſures therein as they ſhall eſteem neceſſary and right.</p>
                  <p>If theſe people, particularly thoſe in arms, are ingenuous in what has been hinted, and it is their wiſh, or that of any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable part of them, to return,—I ſhould ſuppoſe that it would be expedient and founded in ſound policy, to give every ſuita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble aſſurance to induce them to come. Such an event would be attended with ſalutary effects, would weaken the enemy, diſtreſs them greatly, and would probably have a moſt happy influence in preventing others from joining their arms. On the other hand, the indulgence may be liable to great abuſe, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing it not to be duly guarded: or if the effects produced by it ſhould be partial they will not be adequate to the ends in view. Yet, as the enemy on their part are uſing every device they are capable of, to ſeduce both ſoldiers and citizens from our ſervice into theirs, and have ſucceeded but too well, it is generally though in the military line that ſomething ſhould be attempted to counteract them. Whether Congreſs will be of the ſame ſentiment, and,—if they ſhould,—what and how ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive the mode and indulgence ought to be, is entirely with them.</p>
                  <p>There is one difficulty which occurs with me, ſuppoſing the meaſure to be adopted.—What line of diſcrimination can be drawn upon ſuch an occaſion; though circumſtances ſhould differ and ſeem to require it? While the poor, deluded, ignorant, duped by artifices and a thouſand cauſes to lead them wrong, have a claim to their country's pardon and indulgence, there are many of well-informed underſtanding, who, from their ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly-avowed hoſtile diſpoſitions and inveterate diſregard of her rights, and thoſe who have taken a double and triple part, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not have the ſame pretentions;—whoſe only view in returning
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:031423_0368_0FEC5CFF72D87EA8"/>
may be to ſerve their own ſordid purpoſes, and the better to promote thoſe plans they have ſteadily purſued.</p>
                  <p>One thing more I would obſerve, which is, that if Congreſs judge an adoption of meaſures eligible on the ſubject of my letter, the ſooner it is come into, the better, for the moſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious reaſons; and the time allowed for thoſe to return who wiſh the indulgence, ſhould be fixed at a ſhort period,—not longer, in my opinion, than till the<note n="†" place="bottom">

                  <p>Congreſs will be pleaſed to excuſe me for thus freely com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating my ſentiments, eſpecially when I aſſure them that they are dictated by what I eſteem my duty.</p>

I am inclined to think, if the meaſure propoſed ſhould be deemed expedient, that it will be better that the indulgencies and aſſurances for their return ſhould be communicated through the medium of ſome ſecond, ſecret hand, qualified to offer them and negotiate the buſineſs, rather than by an act of public authority. Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunities, I ſhould ſuppoſe, may be found, by which they may obtain due information in that way, and which will not hold out to the enemy the ſame cauſe of ſuſpicion and of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gilance to prevent their eſcaping. Whatever mode ſhall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered moſt adviſable, ſhould be immediately adopted. What time ſhould be allowed in the firſt inſtance, I am at a loſs to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine: if the continuance is too ſhort, they may be danger of their not being appriſed ſo as to get off: if it is too long, they'll defer matters to the laſt, and act then as circumſtances of intereſt dictate.—To err in the former will be leaſt inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I THIS morning had the honor of your letter of the fifth with its incloſures.—The reſolution of the thirtieth of May, reſpecting the French gentlemen who came paſſengers in the Amphitrite, reached camp before your letter, and has ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited much uneaſineſs in the artillery corps. The incloſed copy of a letter from general Knox will convey their anxiety upon the ſubject,—which I think it neceſſary to tranſmit, as well from duty as on account of his requeſt.</p>
                  <p>The difficulties upon this occaſion ariſe from the peculiar circumſtances of moſt of the officiers compoſing the artillery regiments at this time. I do not know, for my own part, what operation Congreſs preciſely meant the reſolution ſhould have; but if the commiſſions which theſe gentlemen are to receive ſhould give them rank from the date of thoſe they had from the king of France, or from their compact with Mr. Deane, there are but few officers now in the artillery who will not be ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded in their command, unleſs ſome method is adopted to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it. This, I am perſuaded, Congreſs had not in contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation, becauſe it is oppoſed to policy and to juſtice; and I am led to believe the reſolution was come into for want of due information how matters were circumſtanced in this inſtance.</p>
                  <p>The officers now in the artillery I am obliged to conſider of great merit: experience has proved them to be moſt warmly attached to the rights of their country; and their conduct in the line of their profeſſion has been ſuch as does the higheſt ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to themſelves and the gentleman who immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands them. Without derogating in the leaſt from the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of the French officers who are to be commiſſioned, and whom I wiſh to receive every countenance they merit, there is ſtrong reaſon to doubt (laying aſide every conſideration of policy) whether they have ſeen as much real ſervice as our own in the courſe of two campaigns. It would be hard, not to ſay unjuſt, that the latter ſhould loſe their command when they have a claim to every mark of favor, and after they have taken great
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:031423_0370_0FEC5D096DE79A28"/>
pains to form their companies: the ſervice requires that they ſhould not; and I am convinced the event would be attended with the moſt fatal conſequences.</p>
                  <p>But what is to be done?—This is a caſe of difficulty, view it as you will.—I am not for rejecting the French gentlemen:—far otherwiſe,—I am for employing them: and public faith, and the encouragements given to bring them over, demand that it ſhould be done. After much thought and conſideration upon the ſubject, two modes occur to me, as the only poſſible ones by which it can be effected, and by which the inconveniences I have mentioned can be remedied. One is, that a new corps of artillery ſhould be formed, and theſe gentlemen attached to it. This we have reaſon to fear, cannot be done, from the difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties we have experienced in raiſing men, and from their having no intereſt or connexions with the people. Their ſituation in ſuch caſe, if they are men of ſentiment and active diſpoſitions, would be irkſome and diſtreſſing:—The other is, that our preſent officers now under conſideration ſhould have their commiſſions antedated, to give them precedency of rank: and this may be done with the greater propriety as moſt of them were intended to hold the poſts they now ſuſtain, before the French gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men had any claim upon us. It is true they were not commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned, becauſe the old corps exiſted under the firſt arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Further it is ſaid,—and there is no doubt of the fact,—that thoſe gentlemen were promoted by brevet juſt before their departure from France, merely to give them rank here;—ante<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent to which, our officers were ſuperior to them in this point; and theſe brevets only confer local rank, confined to the French American colonies.</p>
                  <p>This latter mode appears the moſt eligible: if it is adopted, they will be diſtributed through the corps as aſſiſtant officers. Their want of a knowledge in our language incapacitates them for command in the firſt inſtance; and not only ſo, but to place them at the head of companies, over officers that have been at great trouble, pains and expenſe in raiſing the men, would be both unmilitary and unjuſt.—I ſhall now quit the ſubject, wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that whatever will beſt conciliate matters and advance the public good, may be done; ſuggeſting at the ſame time with all deference, as it is much eaſier to prevent evils than to reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy them after they have happened, it will be well, in all caſes of foreign and indeed other applications, that the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, which granting them will involve, ſhould be maturely weighed and taken in every point of view. In the preſent caſe of difficulty, things, I am perſuaded, might have been adjuſted
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:031423_0371_0FEC5D0D033C2BB8"/>
with the greateſt facility, had the committee of foreign appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation been fully poſſeſſed of all the circumſtances reſpecting the artillery regiments.</p>
                  <p>By a letter from general Gates, of the ſecond inſtant, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting a copy of one from general Poor, the enemy who were at Split-Rock according to their laſt advices which I forwarded, have returned down the lake. Captain Whitcomb had been ſent out to reconnoitre, and reported on his return that only one boat remained.</p>
                  <p>From ſundry accounts from New-York, there is reaſon to believe the enemy are on the point of making ſome expedition. Their preparation of ſhips for troops, light-horſe, &amp;c. indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates that they intend to go by water. What their object is, yet remains a ſecret. The incloſed copy of an examination is very particular, and as recent as any that I have received.—The perſon who gave the information belongs to Cape-May county, and appeared to be a ſenſible intelligent lad: A de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerter of the ſeventy-firſt this moment came in: you alſo have his examination incloſed.</p>

                  <p>I WAS this morning honored with your favor of the ſixth inſtant, with its incloſures.—I am extremely happy in the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation Congreſs have been pleaſed to expreſs of my conduct reſpecting the propoſed cartel for the priſoners, and ſhall go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern myſelf by the principles which influenced me on that occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and ſuch other as ſhall appear right and juſt, ſhould there be any further negociation on the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall order a return to be made of the chaplains in ſervice, which ſhall be tranſmitted as ſoon as it is obtained. At preſent, as the regiments are greatly diſperſed, part in one place and part another and accurate ſtates of them have not been made, it will not be in my power to forward it immediately. I ſhall here take occaſion to mention that I communicated the reſolution appointing a brigade-chaplain in the place of all others; to the ſeveral brigadiers. They are all of opinion that it will be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for them to diſcharge the duty; that many inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and much diſſatisfaction will be the reſult; and that no eſtabliſhment appears ſo good in this inſtance as the old one. Among many other weighty objections to the meaſure, it has been ſuggeſted that it has a tendency to introduce religious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putes
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:031423_0372_0FEC5D0F307A33B8"/>
into the army, which above all things ſhould be avoided,—and in many inſtances would compell men to a mode of wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip which they do not profeſs. The old eſtabliſhment gives every regiment an opportunity of having a chaplain of their own religious ſentiments,—is founded on a plan of a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerous toleration,—and the choice of chaplains to officiate has been generally in the regiments. Suppoſing one chaplain could do the duties of a brigade (which ſuppoſition however is inad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſible when we view things in practice), that being compoſed of four or five, perhaps in ſome inſtances, ſix regiments, there might be ſo many different modes of worſhip. I have mentioned the opinion of the officers and theſe hints to Congreſs upon this ſubject, from a principle of duty, and becauſe I am well aſſured it is moſt foreign to their wiſhes or intention to excite, by any act, the ſmalleſt uneaſineſs and jealouſy among the troops.</p>
                  <p>There remains no room to believe otherwiſe than that the enemy are on the point of moving: this is confirmed by intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence from all quarters, and through ſo many different chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels, that we muſt conſider it certain. Whether they will move by land or water, or by both, cannot be aſcertained; nor is their deſtination preciſely known: but every circumſtance points out Philadelphia as their object. Being of this opinion, I have directed the return of general Mifflin. Before he left Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, I wrote, countermanding the order for his coming here; but he did not receive my letter.—I would alſo mention to Congreſs that I think the military ſtores, lately arrived, and at or coming to Philadelphia, ſhould be removed to a place of perfect ſecurity. Though I would not excite needleſs uneaſy apprehenſions, prudence requires that things ſo eſſential ſhould not be expoſed to riſk.</p>

                  <p>INCLOSED you will receive a copy of a letter from me to lord Cornwallis, on the inhuman treatment of lieutenant Martin by a party of the enemy's horſe. My remonſtrance and ſending his corpſe produced nothing more than a ſhort an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer from his lordſhip, which you alſo have. It was thought unneſſary to view the body, the fact being admitted and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.</p>
                  <p>I have alſo taken the liberty to incloſe a copy of my letter
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:031423_0373_0FEC5D111F2868F0"/>
to general Howe, in anſwer to his of the twenty-firſt of April, twenty-ſecond of May, and fifth inſtant. From the latter part of the firſt paragraph in that of the twenty-ſecond of May, I was induced to propoſe an exchange of all the priſoners now in his hands, ſo far as it can be effected on the principles of the agreement ſubſiſting between us, except that of lieutenant-colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Campbell and the Heſſian field officers who are to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained till general Lee is declared exchangeable. I did not expect the propoſition would be acceded to: but, as his letter is of doubtful meaning in this inſtance, I thought it expedient to make the offer,—firſt, as it will be a happy event if we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe our priſoners,—and ſecondly, as the propoſition may draw from him an explanation of his ſentiments, though he ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject it.</p>
                  <p>The New-York paper of the ninth inſtant I tranſmit for your peruſal: it contains an extract of a letter from governor Tryon to Chriſtopher Billop of Long-Iſland. This extract, I think, is worthy of attention, and may be improved to great advantage, if publiſhed in the papers with ſuch ſtrictures and obſervations as it will well warrant, and as will occur to an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious pen. The enemy, on their part, uſe the moſt artful pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications, and avail themſelves of every thing they can, going from us. We ſhould profit, where we can, by their produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>I would mention to Congreſs that ſeveral officers in the corps of cavalry have applied to me, to know in what point of view their horſes are conſidered,—Whether as public property, o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> as private belonging to themſelves, to be furniſhed at their own expenſe. When colonel Sheldon's regiment was ordered to be raiſed, the officers thought the horſes ſhould be a matter of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic charge: but as it never had been determined, and I was not perfectly ſatisfied with the cuſtoms in ſuch caſes, I did not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider myſelf authoriſed to decide upon it. I promiſed to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to the conſideration of Congreſs; and this I have done ſince on ſimilar occaſions. The officers urge, that, as horſes are eſſential to the diſcharge of their duty, they ſhould be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided at the public expenſe; that they have riſen to ſuch enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous prices, that, if the contrary is eſtabliſhed, they muſt, from the nature of the ſervice, not only ſink their pay, but make a large ſacrifice of their privaté intereſt.</p>
                  <p>Though the practice may have been againſt their application in other armies, yet their reaſoning ſeems plauſible, and to be founded in juſtice. There are objections too againſt the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, but not of ſufficient validity, in my opinion, to oppoſe to
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:031423_0374_0FEC5D1A2EEDBBA0"/>
their claim. Another reaſon may be ſuggeſted, why the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic ſhould find them horſes, which is, that if they were to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide them themſelves, the apprehenſion of loſing them might prevent a proper diſcharge of duty, and in ſome caſes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce too great a degree of cautious prudence.</p>
                  <p>This matter I have thought it neceſſary to lay before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, not doubting but it will have that attention which it may ſeem to deſerve.—There is one thing more I would add upon the ſubject, which is if their application is conſidered juſt, I ſhould ſuppoſe it beſt to fix a certain determinate ſum to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed for the horſes they have bought and may have occaſion to purchaſe, in preference to leaving it to their diſcretion and judgment.</p>
                  <p>It being evident, ſo far as we can reaſon from circumſtances and appearances, that general Howe deſigns Philadelphia to be the firſt object of his purſuit, or the defeat of this army,—and, for one or both of theſe purpoſes, is collecting nearly his whole force at Brunſwic,—a board of general officers determined yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday evening after mature deliberation, that all the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental troops at Peekſkill and its dependencies, except one thouſand effectives, ſhould be immediately marched to reinforce this army. That number, with the convaleſcents, and ſuch aids of militia as are now and may be aſſembled in caſe of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergency, was deemed competent to the defence of thoſe poſts againſt any attempts that may be made to poſſeſs them in the preſent ſituation of things.</p>
                  <p>I have incloſed a general return ſhewing our whole ſtrength in Jerſey at this time, from which it will appear our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in this reſpect are by no means ſo deſirable as could be wiſhed. I eſteem it my duty to tranſmit information of this ſort from time to time to Congreſs, and am encouraged the more to do it from a conviction that the, ſenſible of the neceſſity of the moſt profound ſecrecy, will not ſuffer the leaſt intimation of our numbers to tranſpire.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>June</hi> 14.—Your fovor of the thirteenth, with its inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, was received laſt night.</p>
                  <p>Having propoſed to general Howe an exchange of the pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners now in his poſſeſſion, as you will perceive by the inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed copy of any letter, and alſo added, that, "<hi>his conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards priſoners would govern mine,</hi>" it appears to me that it would be improper to tranſmit him a copy of your firſt reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the tenth inſtant, till we have ſomething more from him on the ſubject propoſed. I confeſs I did not, nor do I yet, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="79" facs="unknown:031423_0375_0FEC5D1CAA270400"/>
to which I have alluded, and which induced me to propoſe an exchange if that was his wiſh, and to ſubjoin, that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct to our priſoners ſhould govern mine,—as a caution to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent him exerciſing ſeverity on a new mode of treatment of them, contrary to the ſpirit of the agreement between us, and the ideas entertained upon the ſubject when it was firſt entered into,—if ſuch was his meaning.</p>
                  <p>Finding that there would be great difficulty in filling the battalions intended to be raiſed, I did not commiſſion officers for all the ſixteen additional ones: I apprehend ſuch a meaſure would accumulate expenſe without increaſing our ſtrength, and therefore did not ſet the whole on foot.—I ſhall be happy, on governor Coſwell's letter and your recommendation of colonel Shephard, that he ſhould have a regiment: from the character given him, and the terms on which he offers his ſervices, there can be no objection. Congreſs will be pleaſed to appoint him to the command they wiſh him to have; and I ſhould think it adviſable that he be ordered to march with his corps to join this army, leaving proper officers to recruit the deficiency.</p>
                  <p>I have peruſed monſieur De Coudray's opinion about the fortifications, and have no doubt but that it is well founded. I have not ſufficient knowledge of them to pronounce an opinion with certainty myſelf.</p>
                  <p>You will obſerve by the New-York paper the execution of * * *. His family well deſerves the generous notice of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. He conducted himſelf with great fidelity to our cauſe, rendering [<hi>his country eſſential</hi>] ſervices, and has fallen a ſac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                     <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice in promoting her intereſt. Perhaps a public act of genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity (conſidering the character he was in) might not be ſo eligi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble as a private donation.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>June</hi> 15.—When I wrote yeſterday, my information was that one diviſion of the enemy was advancing on the Princeton road, and it was believed from the general movement of their army that they were proceeding towards Delaware. What their real deſign was, is not yet underſtood. Thoſe that ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced on the road, after marching ſome diſtance, filed off to the right down Millſtone river, and joined the other column on the Coryel-ferry road leading by Somerſet court-houſe. One object of their movement might be to incloſe general Sullivan and his diviſion between their two columns: another (which moſt probable was the principal cauſe, if they did not mean to proceed to Delaware when they ſet out) to manoeuvre us out of our preſent encampment into action upon diſadvantageous terms. The firſt they could not hope to ſucceed in after general Sulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:031423_0376_0FEC5D209E61ADF0"/>
changed his poſt to Rocky-Hill,—an event which took place on the evening before, and which it is preſumed they were not well adviſed of when they leſt Brunſwic. A conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable body of them remain at Somerſet court-houſe, and on the communication between that and Brunſwic.—We have been and are harraſſing them with light-troops: but they being in open ground with a large train of artillery, we cannot do it ſo effectually as could be we wiſhed.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall be glad to be informed whether general De Haas conſiders himſelf an officer in the army. He has never joined it ſince his promotion, or written a ſingle line to me upon the ſubject. If he accepts his commmiſſion it will be well for Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to order him to repair to the army immediately. The brigade intended for him is without a general officer, and has brought on a diſagreeable diſpute between two of the colonels, each claiming the command. This is not the only inconveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence:—officers of high rank remaining at home afford a bad example to others who are inferior, and grounds of application for the like indulgence.</p>
                  <p>This letter, except the paragraphs of this date, I intended to ſend yeſterday, but was prevented by the movement of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my which rendered it unadviſable.</p>

                  <p>WHEN I had the honor of addreſſing you laſt, I informed you that the main body of the enemy had marched from Brunſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wic, and extended their van as far as Somerſet court-houſe. I am now to acquaint you, that, after emcamping between theſe two poſts and beginning a line of redoubts, they changed their ground yeſterday morning and in the courſe of the preceding night, and returned to Brunſwic again, burning, as they went, ſeveral valuable dwelling houſes. We had conſtantly light troops hovering round them as far as circumſtances would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: but, being ſecured on their flanks by the Rariton and Millſtone, they were difficult to approach; and, without loſs, effected their return to their former poſts. This ſudden and precipitate change in their operations has afforded matter for much ſpeculation. We ſuppoſe their original deſign was to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt an impreſſion on our right, or to manoeuvre us out of our ground, or to advance towards the Delaware. Whether theſe conjectures were well founded, cannot be aſcertained: but it is probable, if they had an impreſſion in view, they found it could not be attempted without great loſs—(as to bringing on an attack, they effectually ſecured themſelves againſt one by the poſt they took)—or if paſſing the Delaware was their object, that, from the temper of the people, the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of it (if not impracticable) would meet with much greater oppoſition than what they expected: for I muſt obſerve,—and with peculiar ſatisfaction I do it,—that, on the firſt notice of the enemy's movements, the militia aſſembled in a moſt ſpirited manner, firmly determined to give them every annoyance in their power, and to afford us every poſſible aid. This I thought it my duty to mention in juſtice to their conduct; and I am inclined to believe that general Howe's return, thus ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly made, muſt have been in conſequence of the information he received that the people were in and flying to arms in every quarter to oppoſe him. I ſhall not reaſon upon this event: but I cannot but conſider it as a moſt fortunate and happy one to us, and the moſt diſtreſſing Mr. Howe has yet experienced, unleſs he has ſchemes in contemplation beyond the reach of my con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould have written to Congreſs more frequently reſpecting the enemy after they came from Brunſwic, had I not been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt conſtantly on horſe-back, and had their deſigns been clear: but as they were not, I did not wiſh to puzzle them with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures, more eſpecially as I wrote general Arnold (with whom
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:031423_0378_0FEC5D2A8772D470"/>
I was obliged to correſpond, that he might co-operate with me as circumſtances ſhould require) to tranſmit them copies of my letters.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed you will be pleaſed to receive an extract of a letter from colonel Jackſon of Boſton to general Knox. The intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence it contains is intereſting; and I ſhall be happy to hear that the two brigs mentioned have captured the remainder of the Heſſians, and more particularly ſo if the capture ſhould not be far from the Britiſh coaſt, provided they arrive ſafe.</p>

I have alſo written to general Putnam, to hold four regiments in readineſs to embark for general Schuyler's aid, ſhould further intelligence from Canada reſpecting the enemy's movements make it neceſſary. The uncertainty of general Howe's operations will not permit more to be done at this time. General Parſons arrived here this morning, and his diviſion is marching to their ground towards the left of the lines.</p>
                  <p>I omitted to mention in my laſt, that, in conſultation with my general officers, it was agreed that promotions ſhould be <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

                  <p>I HAVE the honor and pleaſure to inform you that the enemy evacuated Brunſwic this morning and retired to Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy, burning many houſes as they went along. Some of them, from the appearance of the flames, were conſiderable buildings.</p>
                  <p>From ſeveral pieces of information and from a variety of cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances it was evident that a movement was in agitation; and it was the general opinion that it was intended this morning. I therefore detatched three brigades under the command of major-general Greene to fall upon their rear, and kept the main body of the army paraded upon the heights, to ſupport them if there ſhould be occaſion. A party of colonel Morgan's regiment of light infantry attacked and drove the Heſſian piquet about ſun-riſe: and, upon the appearance of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Wayne's brigade and Morgan's regiment (who got firſt to the ground) oppoſite Brunſwic, the enemy immediately croſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the bridge to the eaſt ſide of the river, and threw them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves into redoubts which they had before conſtructed. Our troops advanced briſkly upon them; upon which they quitted the redoubts without making any oppoſition, and retired by the Amboy road.</p>
                  <p>As all our troops, from the difference of their ſtations in camp, had not come up when the enemy began to move off, it was impoſſible to check them, as their numbers were far greater than we had any reaſon to expect,—being, as we were informed afterwards, between our and five thouſand men. Our men pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued them as far as Piſcatawa: but finding it impoſſible to over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take them, and fearing they might be led on to the main body, they returned to Brunſwic.</p>
                  <p>By information of the inhabitants, general Howe, lord Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis, and general Grant, were in the town when the alarm was firſt given: but they quitted it very ſoon after.</p>
                  <p>In the purſuit, colonel Morgan's riflemen exchanged ſeveral ſharp fires with the enemy, which, it is imagined, did conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble execution.—I am in hopes that they afterwards fell in with general Maxwell, who was detached laſt night with a ſtrong
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:031423_0380_0FEC5D2F0C2FB0A0"/>
party, to lie between Brunſwic and Amboy to intercept any convoys or parties that might be paſſing: but I have yet heard nothing from him.</p>
                  <p>General Greene deſires me to make mention of the conduct and bravery of general Wayne and colonel Morgan, and of their officers and men, upon this occaſion, as they conſtantly advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced upon an enemy far ſuperior to them in numbers, and well ſecured behind ſtrong redoubts.</p>
                  <p>General Sullivan advanced from Rocky-Hill to Brunſwic with his diviſion; but, as he did not receive his order of march till very late at night, he did not arrive till the enemy had been gone ſome time.</p>
                  <p>I have ſent down lord Sterling's diviſion to reinforce general Maxwell; and in the morning I ſhall move the main body of the army to ſome ſecure poſt nearer Amboy, from whence we can with more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>When I had the honor to addreſs you laſt, it was on the ſubject of the enemy's retreat from Brunſwic to Amboy, and of the meaſures purſued to annoy them. At the time of writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the information I had received reſpecting their loſs was ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther vague and uncertain: but we have reaſon to believe, from intelligence through various channels ſince, that it was pretty conſiderable, and fell chiefly on the grenadiers and light infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try who formed their covering party. The incloſed copy of a letter, containing the information of a perſon juſt from New-York, correſponds with other accounts on this head, and with the declarations of ſome deſerters. Some of the accounts are, that officers were heard ſo ſay they had not ſuffered ſo ſeverely ſince the affair at Princeton.</p>
                  <p>After the evacuation of Brunſwic, I determined, with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of my general officers, to move the whole army the next morning to this poſt, where they would be nearer the enemy and might act according to circumſtances. In this I was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by rain, and they only moved yeſterday morning. I have advanced lord Sterling's diviſion and ſome other troops
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:031423_0381_0FEC5D3117A2CBE8"/>
lower down in the neighbourhood of Metuchin meeting-houſe, and intended to have poſted more there; but found, on recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noitring the ground, that it was low and diſadvantageous, and ſtill more unfavourable through a ſcarcity of water. Theſe rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, added to that of there not being the ſmalleſt proſpect of attacking the enemy in Amboy with a probability of ſucceſs,—ſecured on their flanks by water, and in their front by ſtrong redoubts acroſs the Neck,—would not permit me, either in my own opinion or that of my general officers, to keep any greater body of men in that quarter, where they would have been diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, and of conſequence extremely inſecure.</p>
                  <p>I have light parties lying cloſe on the enemy's lines, to watch their motions, and who will be ready to act in conjuction with lord Sterling's diviſion and ſuch other troops as it may be neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to detach; though I think,—and ſo do the reſt of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers,—that no event is likely to take place that will require more, ſince the idea of forcing their lines, or bringing on a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nearl engagement on their own ground, is univerſally held in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compatiable with our intereſt, and that that number is ſufficient to avail us of any advantages we can expect to ariſe from their retreating from Amboy, ſuppoſing notice of the fact ſhould be obtained. Their contiguity to the Sound, and the ſmall diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance acroſs it (having boats prepared to paſs in), will enable them to get off (ſhould they ſo incline) againſt every prudent and juſtifiable exertion on our part. Whether ſuch is their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, is more than I can poſitively determine but there is every reaſon to believe that they have been and are tranſporting their baggage to Staten-Iſland, and making every preparation to embark on board their tranſports for ſome new expedition.</p>
                  <p>Your favour of the twenty-fourth I juſt now received, and am extremely obliged by your cordial congratulations on the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy's retreat from Brunſwic, and favorable interpretation of the event to my conduct.—The reſolution you did me the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor to tranſmit ſhall have my attention.</p>
                  <p>It is much to be regretted, that an expreſs ſent off to general Maxwell on ſaturday night, to inform him of general Greene's movement towards Brunſwic that he might conduct himſelf ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, did not reach him. Whether the expreſs went de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſignedly to the enemy, or was taken, is not known: but there is reaſons to believe he fell into their hands. If general Maxwell had received the order, there is no doubt but their whole rear guard would have been cut off. This the enemy confeſſed themſelves, as we are well informed by perſons in Bonemtown.</p>
                  <p>By a reconnoitring party juſt returned, it is reported as a
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:031423_0382_0FEC5D3327A60258"/>

                  <p>ON thurſday morning general Howe advanced with his whole army in ſeveral columns, from Amboy, as far as Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field. We are certainly informed that the troops ſent to Stat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en-Iſland returned the preceding evening, and, it is ſaid, with an augmentation of marines, ſo that carrying them there was a feint with intention to deceive us. His deſign in this ſudden movement was either to bring on a general engagement upon diſadvantageous terms, conſidering matters in any point of view,—or to cut off our light parties, and lord Sterling's diviſion which was ſent down to ſupport them,—or to poſſeſs himſelf of the heights and paſſes in the mountains on our left. The two laſt ſeemed to be the firſt objects of his intention, as his march was rapid againſt theſe parties and indicated a ſtrong diſpoſition to gain thoſe paſſes.</p>
                  <p>In this ſituation of affairs it was thought abſolutely neceſſary that we ſhould move our force from the low grounds, to occupy the heights before them; which was effected. As they advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, they fell in with ſome of our light parties and part of lord Sterling's diviſion, with which they had ſome pretty ſmart ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing, with but very little loſs I believe on our ſide, except in three field-pieces which unfortunately fell into the enemy's hands; but, not having obtained returns yet, I cannot deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine it with certainty; nor can we aſcertain what the enemy's loſs was.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon as we had gained the paſſes, I detached a body of light troops under brigadier-general Scott, to hang on their flank, and to watch their motions; and ordered Morgan's corps of riflemen to join him ſince.—The enemy remained at Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field till yeſterday afternoon, when, about three o'clock, they moved towards Spanktown, with our light troops in their rear and purſuing. The enemy have plundered all before them, and it is ſaid, burned ſome houſes.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE not been able to aſcertain yet with any degree of preciſion the loſs ſuſtained by the enemy in the ſeveral ſkir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes on thurſday, though we have many reaſons to believe it was much more conſiderable than what it was apprehended to be when I had the honor of addreſſing you upon the ſubject. The incloſed copy of a letter from lord Stirling contains the fulleſt and moſt particular information that I have received: and the accounts given by ſundry inhabitants to perſons who have been in the neighborhood where the ſkirmiſhes were, and where the enemy were encamped, countenance this intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence.</p>
                  <p>As to our loſs, as reported by the enemy, I am perſuaded it is exaggerated beyond all bounds of truth or probability, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aſſured by lord Stirling that it was trifling,—and by ſuch deſerters as have come in, that they ſaw but very few priſoners taken. It would have been certainly known before this (that is, the number not yet returned), had not ſome of the parties, and I believe the moſt which were then out, joined the corps ſince detached.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect to the enemy's deſigns or intended movements, they are not to be determined. It is certain they got into Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boy yeſterday evening; and, from advices this morning from officers ſent to South-Amboy to obſerve their motions, there were ſtrong reaſons to conclude they were evacuating the town, as their horſe had gone over to Staten-Iſland, and as ſeveral boats were alſo paſſing with baggage, and others with troops. There were further circumſtances favoring this opinion, ſuch as apparent breaches in ſome of their lines: yet general Sulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van informs me by a letter juſt now received, that, from all the intelligence he has been able to obtain to-day, he does not think they have any ſerious intention of quitting it, and that all their movements are a feint, calculated merely to deceive, and to cover ſome plans they have in view.</p>
                  <p>I have two brigades,—Scott's and Conway's,—now lying at and near Woodbridge, as corps of obſervation, and to act as circumſtances may require. General Sullivan was down in the ſame neighborhood with his diviſion, till this evening, when he returned, it appearing to him unneceſſary to remain longer, and that the brigades I have mentioned would be ſufficient for any event likely to take place.</p>

                     <p>P. S. <hi>June</hi> 30.—From intelligence received laſt night, the opinion that the enemy are evacuating Amboy ſeems to be more confirmed.</p>
                     <p>As the facts in lord Stirling's letter are rather taken up on report than from any certain knowledge of their having hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, I cannot conſider them ſufficiently authentic for publi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation; nor are they tranſmitted for that purpoſe, though I am well perſuaded the enemy's loſs was much more conſiderable than it was at firſt imagined to be. It has been reported to me to-day that the enemy took ſixty-four priſoners in the whole.—Whether they were all of our army, or in part countrymen, I cannot decide; for having detached at that time a number of light parties, and many of them having fallen in with the corps ordered out ſince, returns could not be made with accuracy.—The priſoners taken by us were thirteen, two of whom are light dragoons, the reſt infantry.—Generals Scott and Conway intended to move towards Amboy this morning: but it is pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable the rain has prevented them.</p>

                  <p>YESTERDAY afternoon the enemy totally evacuated Amboy, and encamped oppoſite to it on Staten-Iſland. Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Scott entered directly after; and poſting guards to ſecure <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

This it was expedient to do, it being night when he entered, and his remaining there might have induced the enemy, whoſe boats were ready, to throw over a ſuperior force in his rear. He wrote me, he ſhould return this morning, and bring off whatever ſtores he may find: though there is little reaſon to expect that they have left any thing valuable behind.—When I am more particularly informed upon the ſubject, I ſhall take the liberty of addreſſing you on the ſame.</p>

                  <p>THE incloſed copies of general St. Clair's letters, tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted yeſterday afternoon and laſt night by general Schuyler, I have thought it my duty to ſend you. The intelligence they contain is important and intereſting; nor are there circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:031423_0385_0FEC5D431A71C680"/>
wanting beſides theſe, to induce a belief, or at leaſt to raiſe a ſtrong preſumption, that the enemy have in contemplation a junction of their two armies by way of the lakes and the North-river. If they have their whole Canada force on the former, it is certainly their object.</p>
                  <p>On receiving theſe accounts, I wrote immediately to general Putnam to embark Nixon's brigade for reinforcing the northern army,—to wait however the arrival or near approach of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals Parſons and Varnum's brigades from this place, who march this morning,—or the coming in of an equal number of militia to ſupply their place before they ſail. This I have done by the advice of my general officers, and is all that is thought prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable in the preſent uncertain indeterminate ſituation of things. The reſt of the army here will be held in readineſs to move ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to information and circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>As I have obſerved, if we were certain general Burgoyne was approaching Ticonderoga with his whole army, I ſhould not heſitate a moment in concluding that it is in conſequence of a preconcerted plan with general Howe, and that the latter is to co-operate with him, by puſhing his whole force up the North-river, and aiming a ſtroke in the firſt inſtance and imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately againſt the Highland paſſes. But as the appearance of the enemy on the lake may be a feint calculated to amuſe and diſtract (though it may ſeem like a real attack), to draw this army to Peekſkill and more to the northward, that general Howe may with more facility turn his arms againſt Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia,—it has been determined unadviſable for us to move till we have further proofs of his intentions, and that our conduct muſt be governed by his.</p>
                  <p>Our ſituation is truly delicate and embarraſſing. Should we march to Peekſkill, leaving general Howe on Staten-Iſland, there will be nothing to prevent him paſſing to South-Amboy, and puſhing from thence to Philadelphia, or in ſhort by any other route; though the marching ſuch of his troops from the point oppoſite Amboy as were encamped there, and the ſailing of the ſhips from Princeſs-bay yeſterday morning, are circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances indicating that an embarkation has or will take place. On the other hand, if the North-river and the poſſeſſion of the Highlands are his objects, our remaining here till his views are certainly known may ſubject us to a riſk that we wiſh to avoid.</p>
                  <p>Thus, let us examine matters as we will, difficulties ſtare us in the face. We ſhall attempt to conſult, and to do the beſt we can.—I have written to generals Putnam and George Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:031423_0386_0FEC47A72B6878F8"/>
fully upon the ſubject, urging them to put forth every ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertion in their power, and inſtantly to call in a reſpectable body of militia to aid in the defence of thoſe important poſts at this critical conjuncture. I truſt they will come out: their ſervices in all probability will not be wanted but for a very ſhort time.</p>
                  <p>I muſt earneſtly requeſt that you will ſend Mr. Stewart, the iſſuing commiſſary-general, to camp immediately. There is reaſon to apprehend the army will be in great diſtreſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion for want of iſſuing commiſſaries in three or four days. On ſaturday, thoſe with Mr. Trumbull declare they will leave him, without they are put on a different footing from what they now are. I need not mention the conſequences that will reſult from ſuch an event, if there are not others here to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply their places.</p>
                  <p>There is one thing more I would add, which is, that there are not more than forty thouſand dollars in the military cheſt, and two months' pay due to all the army, except two or three regiments which have juſt obtained warrants. A hundred and fifty-ſix thouſand, out of the laſt ſupply ſent the paymaſter, I was obliged to order to Peekſkill for the troops in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, whoſe demands are great and preſſing alſo. I muſt ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly entreat that you will forward a ſupply directly to the paymaſter:—ſhould we be obliged to move before the troops are paid, much uneaſineſs and murmuring will be the certain attendants, and, I fear, ſomething worſe.</p>
                  <p>As the enemy will adopt every ſtratagem and device to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and diſtract us,—notwithſtanding the preſent appearance in favor of their making an expedition up the North-river I doubt not but you will have the moſt vigilant look-outs kept along Delaware-bay, and proper expreſſes and ſignals for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating the earlieſt intelligence. I think it would be high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly expedient that ſome ſenſible judicious men ſhould be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in that buſineſs at this time, who would view things as they ought to be, and from whoſe accounts certain inferences and concluſions may be drawn, ſo as to form a proper line for our conduct. The moſt fatal conſequences may flow from falſe information at this period: things ſhould be examined with all poſſible certainty. I ſhall not be ſurpriſed to hear of ſeveral ſhips appearing in or off Delaware, though general Howe's deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination ſhould be elſewhere. Their fleet give them the moſt ſignal advantages, and an opportunity of practiſing a thouſand feints.</p>

                  <p>I WAS this morning honored with yours of the fifth, with ſundry reſolves of Congreſs to which I ſhall pay due at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</p>
                  <p>No change has taken place in the ſituation of the enemy upon Staten-Iſland ſince I wrote to you on the fifth: but I have this morning received an account from Elizabethtown, which mentions that a perſon had juſt come from the iſland, who informs that ſmall craft are conſtantly plying between New-York and the fleet, laden with officers' baggage and ſtores put up in packages, and marked with their names and regiments; and that tranſports are fitted up with ſtalls over their main decks for the reception of horſes. This looks as if a longer voyage was intended than up the North-river.</p>
                  <p>I have given notice to all the eaſtern ſtates to be upon their guard, ſhould the fleet put to ſea and ſteer that way: and I think the works upon and obſtructions in the Delaware ſhould be carried on with ſpirit, and completed as far as poſſible, left they ſhould viſit that quarter. I think the ſouthern ſtates ſhould alſo be adviſed of the uncertainty of the next operation of the enemy, that they may alſo be making ſuch preparations as they may judge neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall make inquiry into the number of arms at preſent at Springfield: and if any can poſſibly be ſpared to the ſtate of Connecticut, they ſhall have all or part of thoſe requeſted by governor Trumbull. General Knox expects the return on ſaturday from Springfield; and I can then determine the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>

                  <p>I THIS morning received a letter of the ſeventh inſtant from general Schuyler, a copy of which, and of its incloſure, I herewith ſend you. The intelligence which they contain is truly intereſting, ſuppoſing it juſt: but it differs ſo widely from what we had reaſon to expect from the accounts mentioned in general St. Clair's letters to general Schuyler (copies of which you would receive in his letter tranſmitted from hence laſt night by major Hoops) that I would fain flatter myſelf it is not true. I am the more encouraged to hope this, as captain Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mam's letter from Fort-Ann to brigadier Learned ſeems to be the foundation of the whole, and does not authoriſe the unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable and unhappy concluſions built upon it. I ſhould ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſuppoſe, if any accident has befallen us, it muſt have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to the detachment of men from the Grants, under colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Warner: for we find from general St. Clair's letters, he expected ſomething from him.—The whole account is ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed that we cannot eſtabliſh any certain deduction from it; and I ſhall be happy if it proves premature and groundleſs.</p>
                  <p>I am told by a gentleman who came to camp yeſterday even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that Nixon's brigade would certainly arrive at Albany on tueſday morning, as he ſaw the veſſels, in which it was em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barked ſtanding up the evening before with a fair wind.</p>
                  <p>If the event mentioned by general Schuyler ſhould not have happened, we cannot doubt but general Burgoyne has come up the lake, determined, if poſſible, to carry his point,—I mean, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> poſſeſs himſelf of our poſts in that quarter, and to puſh his arms further. Suppoſing this not to have happened, as our continental levies are ſo deficient in their number, our ſecurity and ſafety will require that aids from the militia ſhould be called forth in caſes of emergency: if it has, there is now an abſolute neceſſity for their turning out to check general Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne's progreſs; or the moſt diſagreeable conſequences may
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:031423_0389_0FEC5D4D384D5868"/>
be apprehended. Upon this occaſion I would take the liberty to ſuggeſt to Congreſs the propriety of ſending an active, ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited officer, to conduct and lead them on. If general Arnold has ſettled his affairs, and can be ſpared from Philadelphia, I would recommend him for this buſineſs, and that he ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately ſet out for the northern department: he is active, judicious, and brave, and an officer in whom the militia will repoſe great confidence. Beſides this, he is well acquainted with that country, and with the routes and moſt important paſſes and defiles in it. I do not think he can render more ſignal ſervices, or be more uſefully employed at this time, than in this way. I am perſuaded his preſence and activity will animate the militia greatly, and ſpur them on to a becoming conduct. I could wiſh him to be engaged in a more agreeable ſervice,—to be with better troops: but circumſtances call for his exertions in this way, and I have no doubt of his adding much to the honors he has already acquired.</p>
                  <p>In conſequence of the advices from general St. Clair, and the ſtrong probability there is that general Howe will puſh againſt the Highland paſſes to co-operate with general Bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goyne, I ſhall, by the advice of my officers, move the army from hence to-morrow morning towards the North-river. If ſuch ſhould be his intention, we ſhall not be too early, as a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable wind and tide will carry him up in a few hours. On the other hand, if Philadelphia is his object, he connot get round before we can arrive there; nor can he well debark his troops &amp;c. and proceed acroſs the land, before we can oppoſe him.—I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>When I had the honor of addreſſing you laſt, I hoped the intelligence received reſpecting our affairs in the northern depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment was not true, or at leaſt that they were not ſo unfavorable as they were then repreſented. But the incloſed copy of a letter from general Schuyler, which came to hand yeſterday evening, confirms it, moſt unhappily for us, in its fulleſt latitude. This event (the evacuation of our poſts on the lake),—among the moſt unfortunate that could have befallen us,—is rendered more intereſting by the manner in which it took place. I have no further information upon the ſubject than what the copy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains, and ſhall be happy to hear by the next advices, that the main body of the army, of whoſe ſituation general Schuyler
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:031423_0390_0FEC5D52F93D84C8"/>
knew with certainty, have not become priſoners: for I fear, from the diſpoſition they diſcovered on this diſtreſſing occaſion; they would have ſurrendered to the enemy, in caſe they fell in with them, though inferior in number.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect to general Schuyler's demands, it is not in my power to comply with the whole of them. Not a ſingle tent can be furniſhed: the kettles will be, and are ordered on; and an expreſs is going to Springfield for all the muſket-cartridges, ſixty barrels of powder, and a proportionable quantity of lead and cartridge-paper for his uſe. Ten pieces of artillery, with harneſs, are alſo ordered, with proper officers, from Peekſkill. I have written to him to procure horſes and drivers himſelf, as they are to be obtained with much more eaſe where he is, than here: nor can he be ſupplied with the heavy cannon which he requeſts, ſuppoſing them neceſſary,—not having one to ſpare from a more important uſe,—the defence of the Highlands. Colonel Putnam, I imagine, will be with him before this, as his regiment is part of Nixon's brigade,—who will anſwer every purpoſe he can poſſibly have for an engineer at this cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis. A ſupply of intrenching tools was ſent him four or five days ago, in conſequence of an application then made.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould be extremely happy if our ſituation would allow me to afford him a large reinforcement of men: but I cannot with any degree of propriety, in the opinion of my general officers, ſend more to his aid at this time than a number of recruits on the march from Maſſachuſetts ſtate, belonging to ſome of the regiments under his command, who amount to ſix hundred at leaſt, and are now, I expect, pretty well advanced towards Peekſkill. With this augmentation to what he already has,—ſuppoſing general St. Clair and his force to have come in, and any number of his militia to have turned out,—he will have an army, equal if not ſuperior to general Burgoyne's, from the only accounts we have obtained.—Beſides this conſideration, it is moſt probable that general Burgoyne will ſuſpend his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions till general Howe makes a movement and an effort on his part. His deſigns, I think, are moſt unqueſtionably againſt the Highlands, and that he will attempt the execution as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>We have been prevented marching to-day by the rain; but, as ſoon as the weather permits, ſhall proceed as expeditiouſly as we can towards the North-river, and croſs or not, as ſhall appear neceſſary from circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>In my laſt I took the liberty of ſuggeſting the propriety of ſending an active officer to animate the militia that may aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:031423_0391_0FEC5D5BD7534C58"/>
for checking general Burgoyne's progreſs, and mentioned general Arnold for that purpoſe. Being more and more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the important advantages that will reſult from his preſence and conduct, I have thought it my duty to repeat my wiſhes on the ſubject, and that he may without a moment's loſs of time, ſet out from Philadelphia for that purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>When this arrives, it is likely general Howe's intention will be well underſtood: but whether it is or not, as there are ſtrong reaſons to believe his operations will be up the North-river and on the eaſt ſide of it, I ſhall take the liberty to recommend the ſending on the North-Carolina and other continental troops at Philadelphia, to join this army, unleſs Congreſs have ſome information that a ſouthern expedition is intended, of which I am not appriſed.</p>
                  <p>If Congreſs have taken colonel Proctor and his corps into the ſervice of the ſtates it will be expedient for them to come on with all the field-artillery which colonel Flowers the commiſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry may have ready. This I have been induced to mention, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving heard Congreſs were about to adopt them, and as our de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand for artilleriſts is great. I would alſo obſerve that the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of our affairs has become ſo delicate and embarraſſing by the late misfortune we have experienced, that it is much to be wiſhed ſome expedient could be come into, if there be any more efficacious than what has been already recommended, for filling and completing the ſeveral regiments. At preſent they only count in number, but not in force, being moſt ſhamefully defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient in their juſt complement.</p>
                  <p>Your letter of the eighth was duly received; and, agreeable to your requeſt, I communicated to generals Greene and Knox the reſolution of Congreſs reſpecting them and general Sullivan, the laſt of whom I have not ſeen ſince it came to hand.</p>

                  <p>I WAS yeſterday evening honored with yours of the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth.—I have heard nothing from the northward ſince my laſt.—I this day received advice from Staten-Iſland, that, on ſunday ſeventy fall of the enemy's ſhips fell down from the watering place to the Hook: but whether they have ſince gone out to ſea, I have not heard. Till I have more certain information of the ſtate of our affairs to the northward, and of general Howe's real intentions I have concluded to halt the army at this place, from whence I can either march forward or return as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances may require.</p>
                  <p>If general Naſh ſhould not have begun his march before this reaches you, be pleaſed to order him to proceed as far as Tren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton only, and there wait my further orders. In caſe he ſhould have marched, be pleaſed to diſpatch an expreſs after him with orders to halt at Trenton.</p>
                  <p>I am pleaſed to hear that you have taken colonel Proctor's corps of artillery into continental ſervice. You will be kind e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to order them to join the army immediately: for I ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the light artillery in a few days from the eaſtward; and artillery-men will be wanted to man them.</p>
                  <p>I have no doubt but the militia from the weſtern parts of New-England will turn out to general Schuyler's aſſiſtance, as I hope thoſe of this ſtate and Jerſey will to mine, ſhould they be wanted.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall be very happy if the committee of Congreſs can arrange the commiſſary's department in ſuch a manner as will ſatisfy the officers concerned in the buſineſs, and at the ſame time ſerve to

                  <p>I BEG leave to congratulate Congreſs on the captivity of major general Preſcot and one of his aides. The particulars of this fortunate event you will find in the incloſed extract of a letter this minute received from general Spencer, which, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, are at large in the packet Mr. Greenleaf will deliver. Lieutenant-colonel Barton who conducted the enterpriſe, and the ſmall handful under his command, have great merit. I ſhall immediately propoſe to general Howe his exchange for that of major-general Lee, which if acceded to, will not only do away one ground of controverſy between general Howe and myſelf, but will releaſe lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the Heſſian field-officers, and procure the enlargement of an equal number of ours in his hands.</p>
                  <p>In mine of this morning I deſired that colonel Proctor's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment ſhould join this army without loſs of time. Upon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſulting general Knox, we are of opinion they had better halt at Trenton with general Naſh till further orders, as the operations of general Howe are not yet perfectly underſtood.—I have nothing new from the northern department,—and only to add, that I have the honor to be, with great reſpect, ſir, your moſt obedient ſervant,</p>

                  <p>I JUST now received a letter from general Schuyler, of the fourteenth inſtant, incloſing the proceedings of the council of war which he alludes to, a copy of which, and of his letter, I herewith tranſmit.

                  <p>General Arnold arrived here laſt night, and will ſet out this evening for Albany.

                  <p>THE little notice I had of your coming to the army, and the ſhortneſs of your ſtay at camp, will more than probably oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion the omiſſion of many matters which of right ought to be laid before you; and the interruption, which my thoughts con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly meet by a variety of occurrences, muſt apologiſe for the crude and indigeſted manner in which they are offered.</p>
                  <p>The completion of the continental regiments is a matter of ſuch infinite importance, that I think no means ſhould be left uneſſayed to accompliſh it. Draughting, where the powers of government are adequate, would be the ſpeedieſt and moſt effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual: but if it ſhould be thought unadviſable to attempt th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">
                        <desc>••</desc>
                     </gap> mode,—next to it I would recommend that the buſineſs of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting ſhould be taken entirely out of the hands of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of the army, and that each ſtate ſhould appoint ſome perſon of known activity (one, for inſtance, who has been a good under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſheriff) in each county or townſhip, not only to recruit, but to apprehend deſerters;—theſe perſons to be liberally rewarded for each recruit and deſerter whom they ſhall deliver, at ſtated periods and places, to officers appointed to receive, diſcipline, and march them to the army;—none of theſe recruiters to have the ſmalleſt power to act out of their own diſtricts, but to be abſolutely fixed to them.</p>
                  <p>A mode of this kind would, in my humble opinion, be leſs burdenſome to the public than the preſent,—prevent the idle habits which recruiting officers contract, not only injurious to
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:031423_0395_0FEC5DBA4BFFC700"/>
themſelves, but to others.—the moſt effectual means which can be deviſed for the recovery of deſerters,—the ſureſt way of keeping your regiments of equal ſtrength, and of making the duty more equal in the detail of it: in a word many valuable advantages would reſult from it, whilſt I can ſuggeſt but one reaſon againſt it,—and that (fully ſatisfied I am), when weigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſcale of intereſt, will not operate,—I mean, the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo many officers in camp, who might be ſpared from the duties of the field till the regiments are ſtronger than at preſent. The ſixteen additional regiments labor under ſuch diſadvantages in ſome ſtates, as to render the interpoſition of Congreſs, in ſome ſhape or other, indiſpenſably neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to food, conſidering we are in ſuch an extenſive and abundant country, no army was ever worſe ſupplied than ours with many eſſential articles of it. Our ſoldiers, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt part of laſt campaign and the whole of this, have ſcarcely taſted any kind of vegetables,—had but little ſalt;—and vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar, which would have been a tolerable ſubſtitute for vegeta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles, they have been in a great meaſure ſtrangers to. Neither have they been provided with proper drink: beer or cider ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom comes within the verge of the camp, and rum in much too ſmall quantities. Thus, to devouring large quantities of animal food untempered by vegetables or vinegar, or by any kind of drink but water,—and eating indifferent bread (but for this laſt a remedy is provided),—are to be aſcribed the many putrid diſeaſes incident to the army, and the lamentable mortality that attended us laſt campaign. If theſe evils can be remedied, the expenſe and trouble ought not to be obſtacles: though ſome kinds of vegetables are not to be had, others are, which to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with ſour krout and vinegar, might eaſily be had, if proper perſons acquainted with the buſineſs were employed therein.</p>
                  <p>Soap is another article in great demand. The continental allowance is too ſmall: and, dear as every neceſſary of life is now got, a ſoldier's pay will not enable him to purchaſe; by which means his conſequent dirtineſs adds not a little to the diſeaſes in the army.</p>
                  <p>I have no reaſon to accuſe the clothier-general of inattention to his department; and therefore, as his ſupplies are incompe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to the wants of the army, I am to ſuppoſe his reſources are unequal. Ought not each ſtate then to be called upon to draw ſuch ſupplies from the country manufactories, as can be afford<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? particularly of ſhoes, ſtockings, ſhirts and blankets,—arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles indiſpenſably neceſſary, and of which ſcarce too many can
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:031423_0396_0FEC5DBBD8E4E108"/>
be provided:—in the mean while, every proviſion to be mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, for clothing the troops uniformly and warm in the winter. It is a maxim which needs no illuſtration, that nothing can be of more importance in an army, than the clothing and feeding it well. On theſe the health, comforts, and ſpirits of the ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers eſſentially depend; and it is a melancholy fact, that the American army are miſerably defective in both theſe reſpects. The diſtreſs moſt of them are in for want of clothing is painful to humanity, diſpiriting to themſelves, and diſcouraging to every officer. It makes every pretenſion to the preſervation of cleanlineſs impoſſible, expoſes them to a variety of diſorders, and abates or deſtroys that military pride, without which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing can be expected from any army.</p>
                  <p>The conſequence of giving rank indiſcriminately is much to be dreaded: great diſſatisfaction has already ariſen on account of beſtowing this on officers of the civil departments of the army, on the inferior ſtaff, waggon-maſter, &amp;c. who, by cuſtom, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, and every other motive, are excluded from it in all well-regulated armies. The too great liberality practiſed in this reſpect will deſtroy the pride of rank where it ought to exiſt, and will not only render it cheap, but contemptible. It is the policy of all armies to make it valued and reſpected, as a ſtimulus to emulation, and an incitement to bold and gallant undertakings: it muſt be very unadviſable therefore, in our in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant ſtate of war, to adopt novel cuſtoms to bring it into diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit,—which muſt and will be the conſequence of making it too common, beſides the diſguſt it creates in others.</p>
                  <p>An auditor of accounts, to be conſtantly with the army, is abſolutely requiſite. It is impoſſible for me, crowded as I am with other buſineſs, to examine and adjuſt the numerous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plex accounts of the army with that correctneſs the public have a right to expect, before warrants paſs for payment; and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doing it, great impoſitions may follow. The proviſion for making regimental paymaſters regulate all regimental accounts is altogether incompetent to the end propoſed from it: for theſe men being appointed generally agreeable to the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of the field-officers of the regiments they belong to, aſſociating conſtantly with the officers of their corps, and in a great meaſure under their controul,—cannot be conſidered as ſufficiently uninfluenced: nor are auditors at a diſtance from the army of much uſe, as it would require a delay not admiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to ſend accounts to them to audit before they were paſſed and paid in conſequence of warrants from the commander-in-chief of the army.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="101" facs="unknown:031423_0397_0FEC5DBE2511BF00"/>
A good geographer, to ſurvey the roads and take ſketches of the country where the army is to act, would be extremely uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, and might be attended with exceeding valuable conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. He might with propriety have the chief direction of the guides, and muſt have a head to procure, govern, and pay them. If ſuch a perſon ſhould be approved of, I would beg leave to recommend Mr. Robert Erſkine, who is thoroughly ſkilled in this buſineſs, has already aſſiſted us in making maps of the country, and has (as I am informed) uniformly ſupported the character of a faſt friend to America.</p>
                  <p>A ſmall travelling preſs, to follow head-quarters, would be productive of many eminent advantages. It would enable us to give ſpeedy and exact information of any military tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that take place, with proper comments upon them, and thereby fruſtrate the pernicious tendency of falſehood and miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>repreſentation, which, in my opinion,—of whatever complexion they may be,—are, in the main, detrimental to our cauſe. If the people had a channel of intelligence, that, from its uſual authenticity, they could look up to with confidence, they might often be preſerved from that deſpondency which they are apt to fall into from the exaggerated pictures our enemies and their emiſſaries among us commonly draw of any misfortunes we meet with,—and from that diffidence of truths favorable to us, which they muſt naturally feel from the frequent deception they are expoſed to by the extravagant colorings our friends often give to our ſucceſſes. It would alſo be very uſeful to diſpatch buſineſs in camp, being the moſt expeditious means of taking copies of orders or other matters that require to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſed, and would ſave a good deal in returns and other papers we are often obliged to get printed in Philadelphia. An in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genious man, to accompany this preſs and be employed wholly in writing for it, might render it ſingularly beneficial.</p>
                  <p>I am exceedingly embarraſſed how to diſpoſe of the French officers in general, but more eſpecially the artillery officers who are come out under the ſanction of a compact. I can think of no other way than that of forming a ſeparate corps of them, and draughting men from the whole line to compoſe that corps: but even this will be attended with many diſagreeable effects:—among others this is not the leaſt, that officers will think themſelves much injured to have the men they have had the trouble of raiſing, taken from them and given to others. There is ſomething in this which is diſcouraging, and breaks the ſpirit of a good officer who prides himſelf in having a full and complete corps.</p>

                  <p>WE have been under great embarraſſments reſpecting the intended operations of general Howe, and ſtill are, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the utmoſt pains to obtain intelligence of the ſame. At preſent it would appear that he is going out to ſea. By au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic information, there are only forty ſhips at New-York; the reſt are gone elſewhere, and have fallen down between the Narrows and the Hook: between theſe two places, the number, from the moſt accurate obſervation, was about one hundred and twenty yeſterday. As I obſerved before, their deſtination is uncertain and unknown: but I have thought it my duty to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form Congreſs of theſe facts, that they may give orders to the militia to hold themſelves in readineſs to march on the ſhorteſt notice, in caſe Philadelphia ſhould be their object. At the ſame time I am to requeſt that they will have a ſufficient num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of proper look-outs fixed at the capes of Delaware (to whoſe accounts implicit confidence may be given), to make the earlieſt reports of the arrival of any fleet,—which Congreſs will tranſmit me by the ſpeedieſt conveyance.</p>
                  <p>As the enemy will probably make many feints, and have it unhappily but too much in their power from their ſhipping, I would adviſe that the look-outs ſhould be cautioned to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely accurate in their obſervations and reports, mentioning with as much preciſion as poſſible, the number of ſhips that may appear.—Our ſituation is already critical, and may be ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered ſtill more ſo by inaccurate and ill-grounded intelligence.</p>
                  <p>From the advices received on ſaturday, of the movements of part of the enemy's ſhips, and the ſtrong reaſons there were to ſuppoſe general Howe would puſh up the North-river to co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>operate

with general Burgoyne, I detached lord Stirling with his diviſion to Peekſkill on ſunday morning:—they croſſed the river that evening and the next morning. This movement will prove unneceſſary, ſhould his deſtination be to the ſouthward. I have alſo ordered general Nixon's brigade from Peekſkill to reinforce general Schuyler, from his repreſentations of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adequacy of his force to oppoſe general Burgoyne, and of the ſeeming backwardneſs of the people in that quarter to afford him aid.</p>

                  <p>I DO myſelf the honor to tranſmit you a copy of my let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to general Howe, of the ſixteenth inſtant, propoſing an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change between generals Lee and Preſcot. I diſpatched it ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the next morning, and preſume it got to hand on the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth. As yet I have not received his anſwer.</p>
                  <p>The amazing advantage the enemy derive from their ſhips and the command of the water, keeps us in a ſtate of conſtant perplexity and the moſt anxious conjecture. We are not yet informed of their deſtination, nor can any plauſible concluſions be drawn reſpecting it, at leaſt not ſuch as appear ſatisfactory. What renders the matter ſtill more difficult and confuſed, is their extreme inactivity and delay: for it is certain they began to embark immediately after the evacuation of Amboy, and now remain between the Narrows and the Hook, or were there when I was laſt adviſed upon the ſubject. I have two active officers, with an eſcort, now out for the purpoſe of intelligence, and for reconnoitring their ſituation from Fort-Lee and along the river in that neighborhood.</p>
                  <p>Things being thus circumſtanced, and various opinions, as to their real object, prevailing among us,—ſome ſuppoſing it to be Philadelphia, others the North-river, and others an expedition more eaſterly,—I would ſubmit it to Congreſs whether the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia of the neighbouring counties ſhould not be immediately called to the firſt, or at Cheſter,—the lower counties, at Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mington. This meaſure appears to me highly expedient, and no objection can lie againſt it, of ſufficient validity to prevent it, as a few days muſt certainly determine their real deſigns.—Should they be againſt Philadelphia, and they have favorable winds, their voyage may be made in a ſhort time, when it may be too late to obtain their aid, and to arrange them properly for defence, ſuppoſing them to come in. I am the more induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to recommend this meaſure, as the ſeveral objects we have to attend to neceſſarily oblige this army to continue at a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable diſtance from that place till their intentions are better underſtood; and as they might by a ſudden and rapid puſh at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:031423_0401_0FEC5DCEF35F7570"/>
to effect ſome material capital ſtroke before we could get there, unleſs there is a reſpectable force to oppoſe them: for, though no great dependence can be put in a militia acting alone, nor a vigorous oppoſition expected from them (from the nature of things) to a diſciplined, well-appointed army, yet their ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations may be greatly retarded by them, and may be checked till other ſuccours arrive. The report of a force, eſpecially if it is in any wiſe reſpectable, let it be of what ſort it may, will have ſome influence on their conduct, and may prevent enterpriſes that would otherwiſe be undertaken.</p>
                  <p>From the intelligence we received on ſaturday evening, that a number of the enemy's ſhips were ſtanding up the North-river,—and in the courſe of that and the preceding day, that forty ſail were in the Sound, going into Fairfield harbour,—I had not the leaſt doubt in my mind but general Howe had in view a ſtroke againſt the Highlands and the fortifications there, and to co-operate with general Burgoyne. In conſequence of theſe advices I judged it expedient to move the army the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, from our then encampment, towards thoſe poſts. Lord Stirling's diviſion was ordered to take the route to King's-fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and to paſs the river to Peekſkill; and I proceeded myſelf with the remainder, which compoſed the main body, by the route leading through the Clove towards New-Windſor. We marched over a very difficult and rugged road till night, when we halted,—the firſt diviſion having advanced about eighteen miles. In this ſituation we lay till yeſterday morning, when, from the information received before reſpecting the enemy's fleet being at or near the Hook, and no further accounts of the ſhips in the Sound, a change in our meaſures took place. Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen and Lincoln's diviſions were ordered to proceed to Cheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, (there to wait further directions, as a place from whence they may move with much more <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>aſe either to Philadelphia or Hudſon's river, being ſeven miles nearer the former, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly convenient to the latter) and general Greene's diviſion to this ground. By dividing, and this arrangement, I am in hopes our movements will be more expeditious, whereſoever they may be neceſſary.</p>

General Ste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phen, with his own and Lincoln's diviſion, alſo arrived a little time after at Howel's ferry, four miles above this.</p>
                  <p>I have thought proper to halt the whole army at theſe two places and at Trenton till our knowledge of the enemy's deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation becomes more certain. If the Delaware is their object, we are now within two day's eaſy march of Philadelphia, and can be there in time, I truſt, to make every neceſſary diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition for oppoſing them.—On the other hand, if general Howe, by this expedition to ſea, only means a deep feint, and ſhould turn his attention againſt the North-river, we can from hence reinforce general Putnam's army more expeditiouſly than if we were farther advanced.</p>

For this, many reaſons might be mentioned, which, I am perſuaded, will occur to Congreſs upon reflection.—The northern department, in a great meaſure, has been conſidered as ſeparate, and more particularly under their direction; and the officers commanding there, always of their nomination. I have never interfered further than merely to adviſe, and to give ſuch aids as were in my power, on the requiſitions of thoſe officers.—The preſent ſituation of that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment is delicate and critical, and the choice of an officer to command may involve very intereſting and important conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE been duly honored with your letter of yeſterday, and with its incloſures.—I ſhall pay attention to the reſolves tranſmitted; and, as ſoon as circumſtances admit, ſhall propoſe to general Howe an exchange between lieutenant-colonel Camp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bell and the Heſſian field-officers, and a like number of ours, of equal rank, in his hands.</p>
                  <p>I would beg leave to lay before Congreſs a copy of a report made by a board of general officers, held on the ſeventh inſtant, to conſult of ſeveral matters reſpecting the army. In the courſe of their deliberation they took into conſideration the ſubject re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported.—I ſhall only add that this matter has been long com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of by the officers, and more ſo as the indulgence they pray could not nor can be ever attended with the leaſt poſſible injury to the public, and is what I believe is allowed in moſt armies.—Congreſs, I am perſuaded, will give it their attention,—and, if no good objections of a public nature appear againſt the meaſure, will grant what the officers wiſh and the board have recommended.</p>
                  <p>I perceive by the reſolves of the thirtieth ultimo and firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, for recalling generals Schuyler and St. Clair, that they are directed to repair to head-quarters. I alſo find that a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee had been reſolved on, to digeſt a mode for enquiring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the reaſons for evacuating Ticonderoga and Mount-Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and into the conduct of the general officers of the north<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ern department at the time of the evacuation.—As theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen have received the letter upon this ſubject by this time, and will probably be down in the courſe of a few days, I ſhall be glad to be informed what to do with them when they arrive. I may then be at a great diſtance from this,—and, in ſuch caſe, ſhould be at a loſs what to ſay, or how to conduct myſelf re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpecting them, without receiving ſome directions, which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt to be favored with by the earlieſt opportunity.</p>

have thought it adviſable to remove the army back to Coryel's, where it will be near enough to ſuccour Philadelphia, ſhould the enemy, contrary to appearances, ſtill make that the object of their next operation; and will be ſo much the more conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niently ſituated to proceed to the northward, ſhould the event of the preſent ambiguous and perplexing ſituation of things call them that way. I was the more inclined to this ſtep, as the nearneſs of the army to the city,—beſides other diſadvantages, afforded a temptation both to officers and men, to indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in licences inconſiſtent with diſcipline and order, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of an injurious tendency.</p>
                  <p>But before my departure I eſteem it my duty to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate to Congreſs the reſult of my examination into the nature of the river-defence proper to be adopted, according to the means in our poſſeſſion, to prevent the ſucceſs of any attempt upon Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia by water. I therefore beg leave to lay before Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs what appears to me moſt eligible, conſidering all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and comparing my own obſervations with the different opinions of the gentlemen whom I conſulted on the occaſion.</p>
                  <p>It is generally a well-founded maxim, that we ought to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to reduce our defence as much as poſſible to a certainty by collecting our ſtrength and making all the preparations at one point, rather than to riſk its being weak and ineffectual every where, by dividing our force and attention to different objects:—in doing this we may diſable ourſelves from acting with ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient vigor any where, and a misfortune in one place may pave the way for a ſimilar one in another. In our circumſtances we have neither men, cannon, nor any thing elſe to ſpare, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps cannot with propriety hazard them on objects, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attended with the greateſt ſucceſs we can promiſe ourſelves, can be productive of only partial and indeciſive advantages, and which may poſſibly fail of the end propoſed,—may have ſome ſerious ill conſequences,—and muſt at all events have ſome diſadvantages.</p>
                  <p>It is then to be conſidered where our defence can be moſt effectually made,—whether at Billingſport or at Fort-Iſland.—It appears to me that the laſt deſerves greatly the preference: Billingſport has but one row of chevaux-de-friſe: Fort-Iſland has three, and, in addition to them, a boom, and another che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaux-de-friſe ready to be ſunk in the channel on the approach of the enemy: of courſe the obſtructions, in this reſpect, are four times as great at the one as at the other. The gallies and floating batteries that could be brought for the defence of the chevaux-de-friſe at Billingſport would be unable to maintain
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:031423_0408_0FEC5DF12E433F18"/>
their ſtation when once the enemy were in poſſeſſion of the commanding ground on the Jerſey ſide, to which they would be entirely expoſed; and, notwithſtanding the works raiſing there,—even ſuppoſing them complete,—the ſtrongeſt advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates for making our defence in this place do not pretend that the event can be protracted more than fifteen or twenty days at moſt; at the end of which time, we ſhould be obliged, with the loſs of our cannon at leaſt, to abandon the defence, and leave it in the power of the enemy to remove or deſtroy the chevaux de-friſe at pleaſure.</p>
                  <p>Nor is it by any means certain that a ſingle row of chevaux-de-friſe would be an impenetrable barrier to the enemy's ſhips:—experiments have been made, that lead to a contrary ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition; and if they ſhould hazard one (which it might be well worth their while to do with their leſs valuable ſhips) under favor of a leading breeze and tide, and ſhould ſucceed in it,—the conſequence might be the loſs of our gallies and floating batteries, which I apprehend might be intercepted, and (with the aſſiſtance of their gallies and ſmall armed veſſels) taken: and this would greatly weaken the oppoſition we might other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe give at Fort-Iſland, and tend powerfully to render it abor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive.</p>
                  <p>But if they ſhould not attempt this, contenting themſelves with ſafer though ſlower operations, I have already obſerved that it is agreed on all hands, in fifteen or twenty days they would be able to poſſeſs themſelves of infallible means of fruſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting our oppoſition there by the capture of our works. And if we add to this that it might very poſſibly happen in leſs time,—if from no other cauſe, yet from the garriſon being intimidated by a conſciouſneſs of its own inferiority and inability to ſupport itſelf againſt a ſo much ſuperior force of numbers, which might occaſion a conduct deſtructive to itſelf,—there will remain no ſufficient reaſons to juſtify the making of this the principal point of defence.</p>
                  <p>At Fort-Iſland, the boom and chevaux-de-friſe are an ample ſecurity againſt any forcible impreſſion of the enemy's ſhips, which it would be imprudent for them to attempt.—On the Jerſey ſide, the ſituation of the ground is ſuch, that the gallies, floating batteries, and forts, employed in the defence of the obſtructions, would have little to fear from any batteries, erect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there. Red-bank ſeems by its elevation to be the only ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous ſpot for annoying them: but as it is computed to be above nineteen hundred yards from Fort-Iſland, the diſtance is rather too great to allow any battery raiſed there to act with
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:031423_0409_0FEC5DF2C380FCE8"/>
ſuch effect as to be able to ſilence our fire.—On this ſide, the ground, by dikes and ſluices, may be laid under water to ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable an extent as to leave no danger of our river force be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing annoyed from thence; for which purpoſe ſuitable prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions ought at once to be made, againſt it be neceſſary to carry them in effect.</p>
                  <p>But though a battery upon Red-bank would not. in my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, be able to prevent the efficacy of our defence, or give any material diſturbance to Fort-Iſland in particular, yet it might ſerve to make the ſituation of ſome of our gallies rather uneaſy; and this perhaps makes it worth while to pre-occupy it in order to keep it out of the enemy's hands, erecting a ſmall but ſtrong work there, capable of containing about two hundred men; with ſix or eight pieces of light cannon and a proportionable quantity of ſtores. As the approaches to it are difficult on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the adjacent creeks, and a communication can be kept open between it and our army,—by which means the garriſon might receive ſuccours from time to time,—though we could not expect to make it impregnable, yet we ſhould have a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of holding it much longer than we could the works at Billingſport. In the poſition, which, from my preſent view of it, I ſhould think it beſt for our army to take, the left wing of it would be nearly oppoſite to Red-bank, and therefore in a condition to relieve and ſupport it;—whereas Billingſport being more remote from the probable poſition of the army, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached from any other work, could not eaſily derive any aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance from without, and muſt rely wholly upon its own ſtrength.</p>
                  <p>Either at Billingſport or at Fort-Iſland, I believe there is not much to be apprehended from the fire of the enemy's ſhips unaided by land batteries: for, as by the information of thoſe who ought to be acquainted with the fact, not more than three ſhips can act a-breaſt at a time at either place,—and as the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, not requiring the ſame depth of water, can extend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves at pleaſure, and beſides carry a ſuperior weight of metal to that which frigates commonly have,—a much ſuperior fire could be oppoſed to them than any they could bring, and (from the difference of ſize and make between the frigates and gallies) to much better effect than theirs. The comparative extent of the river at Billingſport and at Fort-Iſland has been aſſigned as a motive preferable to the former,—the river being narrower there than at the latter, and ſuppoſed to admit of fewer ſhips operating at a time: but as it is aſſerted by the gentlemen i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> the river department, that the ſand-banks and ſhallowneſs of
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:031423_0410_0FEC5DFA32F9AAD8"/>
the river in moſt places near Fort-Iſland compenſate for the width of it, and make it impoſſible for more than three ſhips to act together at a time,—this reaſon for preferring the poſition at Billingſport ſeems to have no foundation. And if we conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der that our whole force of gallies and floating batteries would be collected at Fort-Iſland, aſſiſted by the fort itſelf,—and that it would not be ſafe to truſt them all out for the defence of Billingſport for fear of the diſaſter already ſuggeſted,—it ſeems evident enough that this is the place where our defence may be moſt ſucceſsfully made.</p>
                  <p>One of the moſt weighty conſiderations with me is that our army, as before intimated, could more conveniently co-operate with the defence by water here than at Billingſport. The ground on this ſide is better ſituated here than at the other place: and the army being ſo much nearer the city, it is ſo much the leſs likely that the enemy ſhould be able, by a cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuitous route, to fall into the rear of it, and ſeparate it from the city,—which is a circumſtance that ought carefully to be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to.</p>
                  <p>Some gentlemen are of opinion that our principal dependence ought to be upon Fort-Iſland and its appendages; but at the ſame time, that we ſhould make a part of our defence at Bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingſport,—propoſing, for that purpoſe, that the works there ſhould be continued on the new contracted ſcale, to be garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoned by four or five hundred men. The reaſons for this are, that it would ſerve to delay the enemy, and give our army time to come up, ſhould it be at any diſtance,—and that it would prevent thoſe diſagreeable impreſſions which never fail to accompany the abandoning works that have been once raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and plans that have been once in execution, eſpecially when the perſons concerned in the defence of them repoſe a degree of confidence in them,—which is ſaid to be the caſe in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent inſtance.</p>
                  <p>But theſe reaſons may perhaps not be ſo concluſive as it is imagined: for it is a queſtion, whether, if our army was ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote as to make ſuch a delay neceſſary, the enemy would em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſs themſelves with removing the water obſtructions in the firſt place, but would not rather debark and make a rapid march by land, poſſeſſing themſelves of the city, and of thoſe poſitions which would make the ſurrender of the gallies, &amp;c. in ſome ſort a natural conſequence. And it is worthy of conſideration whether the abandoning the works begun at this time, which will probably allow ſome leiſure for any diſagreeable impreſſions it might make to be effaced, will not be leſs injurious than the
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:031423_0411_0FEC5D85D99FF790"/>
abandoning them hereafter when they have coſt more expence, time, and labor, and in the critical moment of an attack, when every misfortune, and the loſs of the moſt inconſiderable poſt, is too apt to have a much worſe influence on the mind, than the real importance of it will juſtify.</p>
                  <p>Add to this the poſſibility that the garriſon, diſmayed at the approach of numbers ſo ſuperior to their own, might not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer the end expected from them, and might even be loſt by their timidity;—the certainty of loſing the cannon after the time limited for the defence, and thereby weakening that of the upper poſition;—the chance of loſing the gallies and float<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing batteries requiſite for covering the chevaux-de-friſe, by a hazardous and ſucceſsful attempt to break through them,—and the garriſon with them, which would fall of courſe upon ſuch an event.—It is however ſubmitted to Congreſs to balance the advantages and diſadvantages, and determine accordingly. I would only beg leave to give it clearly as my opinion that our principal dependence ought to be upon Fort-Iſland and the obſtructions there, and that Billingſport ought not by any means to be defended more than as a ſecondary object: and, to that end, I would recommend that the works on Fort-Iſland, which, on their preſent conſtruction, are by no means calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated for the defence of the chevaux-de-friſe,—be immediately altered and adapted to that purpoſe, taking care at the ſame time to make them defenſible with a ſmall number of men againſt any ſudden attempt to land in boats and carry them by aſſault.</p>
                  <p>But, whatever ſcheme is purſued, I could wiſh the greateſt diligence and diſpatch may be uſed in bringing it to maturity: for, though the danger which lately threatened ſeems to have ſubſided, there is no knowing how ſoon it may return: and certainly it will be prudent to do every thing in our power to be prepared for it, as we can loſe nothing by being ſo, and may loſe a great deal by neglecting to improve the interval of lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure they have given us, ſhould it be their intention to reviſit this quarter. As the means to this, it will be neceſſary to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Mr. Coudray, to whom the ſuperintendency of thoſe works is intruſted, with a competent number of workmen, tools, and what other things he may want, to enable him to carry them on with propriety, eaſe, and expedition.</p>
                  <p>On the whole, I am of opinion that the obſtructions in the river, with the help of gallies, floating batteries, and with to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerable induſtry to put the land works in a proper ſtate, will be extremely formidable to the enemy, and authoriſe a reaſonable
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:031423_0412_0FEC5DFDF08D2360"/>
expectation of their being effectual. The fire-ſhips alſo will contribute to this end: for though there are many obſtacles to render their ſucceſs precarious, and a happy concurrence of circumſtances is neceſſary towards it,—any of which failing may diſappoint the project,—and there is therefore no room to be ſanguine, yet there is ſome probability of its ſucceeding; and they will be at leaſt an embarraſſment and terror to the enemy, and will oblige them to uſe precautions inconvenient to them, and ſerviceable to us.</p>
                  <p>As an accurate knowledge of the country is eſſential to a good defence,—and as the enemy's approach may be ſudden, and we may be called to act, without having time, when it happens, to examine it ſufficiently if it is not done beforehand, it would anſwer a valuable purpoſe to have it immediately carefully reconnoitred, and ſketches taken of all the landing-places, great roads, and by-paths, encamping grounds, heights, rivers, creeks, moraſſes, and every thing that it can be of any importance to know. Marcus-Hook ſeems to be the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced place at which it is conjectured the enemy will land: the ſurvey ſhould therefore comprehend all the country be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween that and Philadelphia. Monſieur Du Coudray has of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his ſervice, with his engineers, to do this buſineſs, if au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed by Congreſs, only requiring that they may be ſupplied with horſes and a hand or two. If Congreſs approve of it, I ſhall be glad they may be deſired to enter upon it without loſs of time.</p>

                  <p>GENERAL Newcomb having informed me that he had collected a body of about five hundred Jerſey militia at Wood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, I have deſired him to endeavor to keep them together while matters remain in their preſent uncertainty and ſuſpenſe, and to employ them in whatever works may be carrying on at Billingſport or Red-bank for the defence of the river. I men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this, that, if it ſhall be thought proper, monſieur De Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dray may be directed to call for the aſſiſtance of thoſe militia accordingly.</p>

                  <p>MONSIEUR Du Coudray has laid before me a plan of the river, by which it appears that, for a conſiderable ſpace be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the two ſand banks on the eaſt ſide of Fort-Iſland, there is from four to four and a half fathoms depth of water. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this repreſentation, there would be room for three frigates to lie between thoſe banks in ſuch a poſition as to enfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lade the works at Fort-Iſland, and make it difficult to maintain them.</p>
                  <p>There are but two ways of remedying this inconvenience;—one by having a ſufficient number of chevaux-de-friſe ſunk at the entrance between the two banks;—and the other by having the left flank of Fort-Iſland fortification ſupported by a good battery capable of reſiſting the cannon of the ſhips, and obliging them to quit their ſtation. The firſt is evidently preferable, becauſe the efficacy of it will be more certain. A few che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaux-de-friſe properly placed might effectually bar all acceſs to the ſhips: but there is a poſſibility that any battery we can conſtruct might be overpowered by the fire of the ſhipping: and as we have few cannon, and Fort-Iſland is itſelf a marſhy ſpot, incapable of affording earth for the batteries neceſſary to be raiſed upon it, which muſt be brought from the oppoſite ſhore,—it would not be prudent to multiply works there more than cannot be avoided. It would alſo be a great advantage gained, to ſecure the iſland from annoyance except in one point,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:031423_0414_0FEC5E09D3AB7A08"/>
and that in front, from only three ſhips at at a time,—which would be effected by ſtopping up the paſſage between the two banks with the chevaux-de-friſe. I ſhould therefore think it of importance to have this meaſure immediately adopted and carried into execution.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>

                  <p>I DO myſelf the honor of addreſſing a few lines to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs on a ſubject which appears to me of infinite importance, and to have a claim in their ſerious attention. The matter I allude to is the exorbitant price exacted by merchants and ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders of good for every neceſſary they diſpoſe of. I am ſenſible the trouble and riſk in importing give the adventurers a right to a generous price, and that ſuch, from motives of policy, ſhould be paid: but yet I cannot conceive that they, in direct violation of every principle of generoſity, of reaſon, and of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, ſhould be allowed (if it is poſſible to reſtrain them) to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail themſelves of the difficulties of the times, and to amaſs for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes upon the public ruin.</p>
                  <p>This grievance is now an object of univerſal complaint, and of univerſal apprehenſion: and the conſequences that are likely to reſult from a continuance of it excite in every well-affected mind the moſt diſagreeable feelings. The incloſed copy of a memorial from a part of the Pennſylvania officers ſhews their ſentiments upon the ſubject; and I am perſuaded thoſe of the whole army are ſimilar, as they have and do experience the groſs abuſes they complain of. I know that ways and means, for preventing this evil wholly, are difficult (if impracticable) to find out: but I ſhould hope that Congreſs themſelves, or the ſupreme powers in the reſpective ſtates, through their recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, may deviſe ſome mode by which it may be redreſſed in part.</p>
                  <p>I think there are two meaſures, which, if adopted and put under proper regulations, would be of conſiderable ſaving to the public, and to the army, at the ſame time that they would contribute a good deal to do away part of the uneaſineſs of the latter, ariſing from the enormous prices they are compelled to pay for neceſſaries. The firſt is the eſtabliſhment of public tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neries in three or four of the ſtates, under care of a judicious commiſſary or director, to which all hides of the cattle killed for the army ſhould be carried, and tanned. There ſhould be
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:031423_0415_0FEC5E0BC9903630"/>
alſo deputies to attend the army to collect the hides: and it appears to me that eſtabliſhing the tanneries in different ſtates,—for inſtance one in this, and another in Connecticut,—will be much more adviſable than fixing only one in either of them; as the buſineſs may be carried on more extenſively, with more convenience, and at leſs expenſe, than if the raw hides were to be tranſported to one place only, from which probably there would be a neceſſity of carrying them the whole diſtance back again after they were dreſſed.—This ſubject was under conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of Congreſs once before, and a commiſſary (if I recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect, a Mr. Philips) appointed, who declined the office. Leather is of ſuch eſſential uſe, and ſo indiſpenſably neceſſary for ſhoes and other purpoſes in the army, that too much care nor too effectual means cannot be taken to procure it.</p>
                  <p>What I have ventured to mention, if gone into, will add much to our ſupplies, and, I am certain, will prevent the high and unjuſtifiable prices demanded for this article when in the hands of private owners. Beſides, at thoſe tanneries, a number of artiſts, ſuch as ſhoe and harneſs makers, might be employed to work the leather up.</p>
                  <p>In like manner, ſince our imports of ſpirit have become ſo precarious, nay impracticable, on account of the enemy's fleet which infeſts our whole coaſt,—I would beg leave to ſuggeſt the propriety of erecting public diſtilleries in different ſtates.—The benefits ariſing from the moderate uſe of ſtrong liquor have been experienced in all armies, and are not to be diſputed.—In the preſent ſituation of affairs, our ſoldiery cannot obtain ſuch ſupplies as are abſolutely neceſſary; and if they are fortunate enough to get any, it is from the ſutlers at moſt extravagant rates, and at ſuch as are incredible to tell of. This is a ſource of much complaint, and, I ſhould hope, may be removed by ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing proper perſons to buy grain and diſtil it for the army,—large quantities of which may be eaſily procured, and on rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable terms, in many of the ſtates.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect to the obſervation in the memorial about rations, it is certain the preſent allowed value is by no means ſufficient; nor does it anſwer the purpoſe intended. Since that was fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, proviſions, like every other article, though not from the ſame cauſes, have become extremely dear; and what at that time was a juſt equivalent, is totally inadequate now. This matter, I doubt not, will have the attention of Congreſs, and ſuch regulations be made reſpecting it, as may be right and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="120" facs="unknown:031423_0416_0FEC5E0FD174A890"/>
It appears to me from the information I have received, that two companies—each to conſiſt of ſixty men at leaſt—under proper officers, of unſuſpected attachment, ſpirit and activity,—ſhould be immediately raiſed, to guard the laboratory and ſtores at Carliſle. Their ſecurity is of conſiderable import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and ought to be attended to. Theſe companies, beſides ſerving as a guard, will be frequently of uſe as eſcorts and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys to ſtores.—If Congreſs ſhould deem them neceſſary, and order them to be enliſted, yet I would recommend that they ſhould not be raiſed as merely ſtationary or local,—having found from experience that regiments or companies formed upon ſuch a footing enter upon other ſervices with great diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content and reluctance, though the occaſion ſhould be never ſo preſſing.</p>
                  <p>In a letter of the thirteenth of June, I ſubmitted to Congreſs an application from the officers of cavalry reſpecting their hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes,—whether they were to be provided at their own or the public expenſe. I alſo laid before them, in a letter of the fifth of July, captain Sullivan's requiſition for pay.—I ſhall be glad to be honored with their determination upon theſe ſubjects, and alſo in general reſpecting the line of conduct I ſhould pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue as to the pay of officers taken priſoners at any time before the cloſe of the laſt compaign, who have been permitted to be on parole;—and whether there is to be any diſtinction between ſuch of them as are continued by new appointments, and thoſe who are not. I have frequent applications in theſe inſtances, and wiſh to know how to act.</p>
                  <p>Since the expreſs from general Schuyler left this, I received a letter from governor Clinton, a copy of which, and of its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſures, I herewith tranſmit, as they give a much more favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able account of the affair at Fort-Schuyler, than was contained in his letter.</p>

                  <p>THE unfavorable ſituation of our affairs in the northern department, and the preſſing applications of general Schuyler for aid, induced me to write ſome time ago to general Putnam to hold Vancortlandt and Livingſton's regiments in readineſs to embark for Albany, in caſe I ſhould find it neceſſary, and the ſuccours he received of militia would juſtify the meaſure. I have the honor to acquaint you, that, by a letter from him,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:031423_0417_0FEC5D815334F630"/>
of the ſixteenth, which came to hand yeſterday, he informed me, that, without waiting for further directions, he had order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to proceed with all poſſible expedition, as the late advices from that quarter ſeemed to make a further augmenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the army requiſite.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe, I have, contrary to my wiſhes, but from the neceſſity of the caſe, ordered colonel Morgan to march imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately with his corps as an additional ſupport. I hope they will be of material ſervice, particularly in oppoſing the ſavage part of general Burgoyne's force, which, from every account, ſpreads a general alarm among the inhabitants, and affects the minds of the militia not a little, who have not been much ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to their mode of warfare.</p>

                  <p>FROM the time which has elapſed ſince general Howe departed from the capes of Delaware, there is the ſtrongeſt rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon to conclude that he is gone either to the eaſtward or ſouth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, and with a deſign to execute ſome determined plan. The danger of the ſea,—the injury his troops muſt ſuſtain from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſo long confined,—the loſs of time, ſo late in the campaign,—will ſcarcely admit a ſuppoſition that he is merely making a feint, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> to return either to the Delaware or the North-river without performing ſome enterpriſe firſt in another quarter. The probability is in favour of a ſouthern expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, becauſe he has been ſeen, ſince his departure from the capes, off Sinapuxent, ſteering a ſouthern courſe,—and becauſe, had his deſtination been to the eaſtward, his arrival there, from the general ſtate of the winds, muſt have announced it before this, or his fleet would have been diſcovered by ſome of the cruiſers on that coaſt.</p>
                  <p>If he is gone to the ſouthward, he muſt be gone far that way: for, had Cheſapeak-bay been his object, he would have been there long ſince, and the fact well eſtabliſhed. Beyond that, there is no place ſhort of Charleſton, of ſufficient importance to engage his attention. The extenſive commerce, the vaſt accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulation of military and other ſtores in that town and its depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dencies, with the eclat it would give his arms if he ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately take it, afford him ſtronger inducements to direct his operations there, than he could poſſibly have elſewhere.</p>
                  <p>Matters being thus circumſtanced, an important queſtion a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes,—how this army is to be employed? If his intentions are ſuch as I have ſuppoſed them, it appears to me that an attempt to follow him would not only be fruitleſs, but would be attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the moſt ruinous conſequences. The diſtance is ſo im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menſe that general Howe might accompliſh every purpoſe he had in view, before we could poſſibly arrive to oppoſe him; and ſo long a march through an unhealthy climate at this ſeaſon would debilitate and waſte a principal part of our force. Add<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to this, after we had made a conſiderable progreſs, he might eaſily reimbark his troops and turn his arms againſt Philadelphia or elſewhere, as he ſhould think proper, without our being in a condition to give the leaſt aid.</p>
                  <p>As theſe, and many other reaſons which will readily occur to Congreſs, will ſhew the impracticability of our counteracting general Howe in that quarter with any good effect, we have no other alternative left than to remain here idle and inactive, on
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:031423_0420_0FEC5E1D46391808"/>
the remote probability of his returning this way,—or to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed towards Hudſon's-river, with a view of oppoſing general Burgoyne, or making an attempt on York-Iſland, as the ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of affairs ſhall point out. A ſucceſsful ſtroke with reſpect to either would be attended with the moſt ſignal advantages, and would be the beſt compenſation we could make for any loſſes we may ſuſtain to the ſouthward. Beſides theſe conſiderations,—if, after all our conjectures and reaſonings upon the ſubject, general Howe ſhould be gone to the eaſtward to co-operate with Mr. Burgoyne, the army will be, by the movement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, ſo far on its way to prevent, I hope, the ſucceſs of his enterpriſe.</p>
                  <p>The above reaſons led me to call a council of general officers this morning, to take the ſubject of removing the troops from hence into conſideration: and I am happy to inform Congreſs they were in ſentiment with me upon the occaſion, as they will perceive by a copy of the proceedings then had, which I do my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the honor of laying before them. Nevertheleſs, as it is a movement which may involve the moſt important conſequences, I have thought proper to ſubmit it to Congreſs for their deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beration and deciſion. If it is deemed expedient, we have per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps not a moment to loſe in carrying it into execution; and, under this perſuaſion, I have ſent colonel Hamilton, one of my aides, (who will have the honor of delivering this) to bring me the reſult of their opinion.</p>
                  <p>As the northern department has been all along conſidered ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parate, and in ſome meaſure diſtinct, and there are ſpecial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolves veſting the command in particular perſons.—in caſe it ſhould hereafter appear eligible to unite the two armies, it may perhaps be neceſſary that Congreſs ſhould place the matter up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch a footing as to remove all ſcruples or difficulties about the command, that could poſſibly ariſe on my arrival there.—This I requeſt, from a diſpoſition to harmony, and from my knowing the ill and fatal conſequences that have often ariſen from ſuch controverſies, and not from the moſt diſtant appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion that one would take place upon ſuch an event. The thing however is poſſible, and to guard againſt it can do injury.</p>

                  <p>I AM this moment honored with yours of this morning, containing ſeveral pieces of intelligence of the fleet's having been ſeen off the capes of Virginia on the fifteenth inſtant.—I ſhall, in conſequence of this information, halt upon my pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ground till I hear ſomething further.</p>
                  <p>Colonel Pinckney of South-Carolina paid me a viſit two days ago. He informed me that the military ſtores in Charleſton and the neighborhood were immenſe, and that he did not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve that the governor or commanding officer there had had the leaſt intimation of the fleet's having ſtood to the ſouthward; and he ſeemed very apprehenſive, that, if Charleſton was their object, they would find them lulled into ſecurity, and quite un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prepared for an attack.—As I cannot yet think that general Howe ſeriouſly intends to go into Cheſapeak, I would by all means adviſe that an expreſs be immediately diſpatched (if one has not already gone) to warn them of their danger, to let them prepare in the beſt manner for defence, and to adviſe them to remove all ſupernumerary ſtores.</p>

                  <p>I BEG leave to inform you that the army marched early this morning, and will encamp, I expect, this evening, within five or ſix miles of Philadelphia. To-morrow morning it will move again, and I think to march it through the city, but without halting. I am induced to do this, from the opinion of ſeveral of my officers and many friends in Philadelphia, that it may have ſome influence on the minds of the diſaffected there, and thoſe who are dupes to their artifices and opinions. The march will be down Front and up Cheſnut-ſtreet, and, I pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, about ſeven o'clock.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding the arrival of the enemy's fleet in Cheſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peak-bay, and the ſeeming probability that general Howe will debark his troops and attempt ſomething, yet I would take the liberty to mention that I think the ſeveral works for the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence of the city ſhould be carried on with the uſual induſtry, and that no pains ſhould be omitted to complete them. I would alſo adviſe that the ſame look-outs for intelligence ſhould be continued at the capes, and the earlieſt information communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated of any thing material: for, though the fleet is in Cheſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peak-bay, the enemy may puſh in a number of veſſels with troops, and make an effort to effect ſome ſtroke againſt Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia by ſurpriſe. Such an event does not ſeem probable while they have a larger ſhew of force in a neighboring ſtate: but it will be prudent to guard againſt it.</p>

<pb n="128" facs="unknown:031423_0424_0FEC5E228863F300"/>
to communicate:—they remain where they debarked firſt. I could not find out from enquiry what number is landed, nor form an eſtimate of it from the diſtant view I had of their en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>campment. But few tents were to be ſeen from Iron-hill and Gray's-bill, which are the only eminences about Elk. I am happy to inform you that all the public ſtores are removed from thence, except about ſeven thouſand buſhels of corn. This I urged the commiſſary to get off as ſoon as poſſible, and hope it will be effected in a few days, if the enemy ſhould not prevent, which their ſituation gives them but too eaſy an opportunity of doing. The ſcarcity of teams in proportion to the demand will render the removal rather tedious, though I have directed the quarter-maſter to ſend ſome from hence to expedite the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>

                  <p>HAVING endeavored, at the ſolicitation of the count De Pulaſki, to think of ſome mode for employing him in our ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, there is none occurs to me, liable to ſo few inconvenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies and exceptions as the giving him the command of the horſe. This department is ſtill without a head, as I have not, in the preſent deficiency of brigadiers with the army, thought it adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to take one from the foot for that command. The nature of the horſe ſervice with us being ſuch that they commonly act in detachments, a general officer with them is leſs neceſſary than at the head of the brigades of infantry. In the abſence of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Smallwood, who is ordered to put himſelf at the head of the Maryland militia, we ſhall have two brigades without gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral officers.</p>

                  <p>This gentleman, we are told, has been, like us, engaged in defending the liberty and independence of his country, and has ſacrificed his fortune to his zeal for thoſe objects.

                  <p>Our light parties yeſterday took between thirty and forty priſoners; twelve deſerters from the navy and eight from the army have already come in; but they are able to give us very little intelligence.

                  <p>THE lateſt and moſt material intelligence which I have obtained reſpecting the enemy, you will find in the incloſed pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers which I do myſelf the honor of tranſmitting to you.</p>
                  <p>How far the enemy have it in view to extend themſelves in a line from bay to bay, I cannot determine: but the idea has taken place with many: and it is ſaid to be founded on their hints to ſome perſons, who,—from accident in ſome inſtances, and perhaps choice in others,—have had a more familiar inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with them. I cannot ſuppoſe they have any ſuch deſign, or, if they have, that it can be more than temporary for procu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring ſupplies of proviſions.</p>
                  <p>General Howe's declaration is agreeable to his conſtant uſage, and is what we might reaſonably expect. The only difference is, the preſent exhibition is ſtyled a <hi>'declaration.'</hi> It is another effort to ſeduce the people to give up their rights, and to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage our ſoldiers to deſert. The facts contained in the depoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Francis Alexander, which you have alſo incloſed, ſeem to be oppoſed to that regularity and diſcipline which are pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed by the declaration.</p>
                  <p>Yeſterday there was ſome ſkirmiſhing between one of our advanced parties and one of the enemy's, in which they were obliged to retreat with the loſs of an officer and three men kil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, according to report.—We had one private wounded.</p>
                  <p>I have received no particular accounts reſpecting the Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land Eaſtern-Shore militia: from the beſt information I have, a great many are well diſpoſed to turn out, but are prevented
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:031423_0427_0FEC5D8A5619B700"/>
giving their aid through want of arms.—Apprehending that the militia there would ſtand in need of an officer to arrange them, I wrote to general Cadwallader, requeſting his good offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, which I am told have been exerted.—Colonel Gift is now gone down, and I expect will move on as ſoon as poſſible, with ſuch as are armed, towards the enemy.—General Smallwood is gone to take the command of thoſe on the Weſtern-Shore, of whom I hear many are collecting:—but I have no authentic advices on the ſubject.</p>

                  <p>I THIS minute returned to head-quarters where I found your favor of this date, with the reſolves reſpecting general Sul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livan, and colonel Richardſon's battalion.—I had converſed with general Sullivan upon the ſubject, and obſerved to him that it was neceſſary an inquiry ſhould be had relative to the affair of Staten-Iſland, as his conduct was cenſured, and much diſſatisfaction prevailed. He was ſenſible of the propriety of the meaſure, and expreſſed a deſire that it ſhould take place, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:031423_0428_0FEC5E29E9C008B8"/>
he could have the benefit of general Smallwood's teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, who was on the expedition.—That gentlemen happens at this time to be in Maryland; which muſt neceſſarily delay the inquiry, unleſs ſome mode can be agreed upon for obtaining his ſentiments upon the matter.</p>
                  <p>This morning the enemy came out with a conſiderable force and three pieces of artillery, againſt our light advanced corps, and, after ſome pretty ſmart ſkirmiſhing, obliged them to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat,—being far inferior in number, and without cannon.—The loſs on either ſide is not yet aſcertained: ours, though not exactly known, is not very conſiderable: theirs, we have reaſon to believe, was much greater, as ſome of our parties, compoſed of expert markſmen, had opportunities of giving them ſeveral cloſe, well-directed fires,—more particularly in one inſtance, when a body of riflemen formed a kind of ambuſcade.—They advanced about two miles this ſide of Iron-Hill, and then with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drew to that place, leaving a piquet at Couch's mill, about a mile in front. Our parties now lie at White-Clay creek, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept the advanced piquets, which are at Chriſtiana bridge.</p>
                  <p>Our monday a large detachment of the enemy landed at Ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil court-houſe; and this morning I had advice of their having advanced on the Newcaſtle road as far as Carſon's tavern. Parties of horſe were ſent out to reconnoitre them, which went three miles beyond the Red-Lion, but could neither ſee nor hear of them; whence I conjectured they filed off by a road to their left, and fell in with their main body.—The deſign of their movement this morning ſeems to have been to diſperſe our light troops who had been troubleſome to them, and to gain poſſeſſion of Iron-Hill, to eſtabliſh a poſt moſt probably for covering their retreat in caſe of accidents.</p>

                  <p>In reſpect to the militia requeſted of Jerſey, his excellency is doubtful whether they can be obtained: for governor Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vingſton, by a late letter, informed him that he had no expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation that more than three hundred, of the thouſand called for to garriſon the poſts in the Highlands, would march, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding he has iſſued orders for that purpoſe; and that three weeks would probably elapſe before that number went. If the requiſition can be complied with, he has no doubt of general Dickinſon's exertions, and is ſatisfied of the propriety of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointing him to the command. This, he imagines, would have followed of courſe, as he is major-general of all the militia in the ſtate, and has given ample teſtimony, as well of his capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city as of his firmneſs and bravery.</p>
                  <p>By deſerters and other intelligence, his excellency was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed laſt night that the enemy's whole force left Elk yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and advanced on the road towards Chriſtiana.

All their ſhips, except two or three which are ſhips of war, are ſaid to have fallen down the bay, below the mouth of Saſſafras.—We have had no information to-day of any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther movements; and I believe their main body lies about Iron-Hill.</p>

We waited for them the whole day; but they halted in the evening at a place called Milltown, about two miles from us.—Upon reconnoitring their ſituation, it appeared probable that they only meant to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muſe us in front, while their real intent was to march by our right, and, by ſuddenly paſſing the Brandywine and gaining the heights upon the north ſide of that river, get between us and Philadelphia, and cut us off from that city.

                  <p>WHEN I had the honor of addreſſing you this morning, I mentioned that the enemy were advancing, and had begun a cannonade.—I would now beg leave to inform you that they have kept up a briſk fire from their artillery ever ſince. Their advanced party was attacked by our light troops under general
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:031423_0432_0FEC5E3D8A7A9248"/>
Maxwell, who croſſed the Brandiwine for that purpoſe, and had poſted his men on ſome high grounds on each ſide the road. The fire from our people was not of long duration, as the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my preſſed on in force,—but was very ſevere.</p>
                  <p>What loſs the enemy ſuſtained, cannot be aſcertained with preciſion: but, from our ſituation, and the briſkneſs of the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack, it is the general opinion, particularly of thoſe who were engaged, that they had at leaſt three hundred men killed and wounded.—Our damage is not exactly known: but, from the beſt accounts we have been able to obtain, it does not exceed fifty in the whole.</p>
                  <p>After this affair, the enemy halted upon the heights, where they have remained ever ſince, except a detachment of them, which filed off about eleven o'clock from their left, and which has ſince paſſed Brandiwine at Jones's ford, between five and ſix miles above Chad's. The amount of it is not known,—the accounts reſpecting it being various,—ſome making it two or three thouſand ſtrong, and others more.</p>
                  <p>Generals Sullivan, Stirling, and Stephen, with their diviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, are gone in purſuit, and to attack it if they can with any proſpect of ſucceſs.—There has been a ſcattering looſe fire be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our parties on each ſide the creek ſince the action in the morning, which juſt now became warm, when general Maxwell paſſed over with his corps, and drove them from their ground with the loſs of thirty men left dead on the ſpot (among them a captain of the forty-ninth), and a number of intrenching tools with which they were throwing up a battery.</p>
                  <p>At half after four o'clock, the enemy attacked general Sulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van at the ford next above this, and the action has been very violent ever ſince.—It ſtill continues.—A very ſevere cannon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ade has begun here too; and I ſuppoſe we ſhall have a very hot evening:—I hope it will be a happy one.</p>

                  <p>I AM ſorry to inform you, that, in this day's engagement, we have been obliged to leave the enemy maſters of the field.—Unfortunately, the intelligence received, of the enemy's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancing up the Brandiwine and croſſing at a ford about ſix miles above us, was uncertain and contradictory, notwithſtanding all my pains to get the beſt. This prevented me making a diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:031423_0433_0FEC5E3F68573988"/>
adequate to the force with which the enemy attacked us on our right; in conſequence of which, the troops firſt engaged were obliged to retire before they could be reinforced. In the midſt of the attack on the right, that body of the enemy, which remained on the other ſide of Chad's ford, croſſed it, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked the diviſion there under the command of general Wayne, and the light troops under general Maxwell, who, after a ſevere conflict, alſo retired.—The militia under the command of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Armſtrong being poſted at a ford about two miles below Chad's, had no opportunity of engaging.</p>
                  <p>But, though we fought under many diſadvantages, and were, from the cauſes above mentioned, obliged to retire, yet our loſs of men is not, I am perſuaded, very conſiderable,—I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, much leſs then enemy's. We have alſo loſt ſeven or eight pieces of cannon, according to the beſt information I can at preſent obtain.—The baggage, having been previouſly moved off, is all ſecure, ſaving the men's blankets, which being at their backs, many of them doubtleſs are loſt.</p>
                  <p>I have directed all the troops to aſſemble behind Cheſter, where they are now arranging for this night.—Notwithſtanding the misfortune of the day, I am happy to find the troops in good ſpirits: and I hope another time we ſhall compenſate for the loſſes now ſuſtained.</p>
                  <p>The marquis La Fayette was wounded in the leg, and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Woodford in the hand: divers other officers were wounded, and ſome ſlain; but the numbers of either cannot now be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE been honored with your favor of this date.—I heartily wiſh the works on Delaware were completed: but I think,—and in this opinion my officers concur,—that the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice will be injured if any part of the continental troops were now to be employed about them. If we ſhould be able to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe general Howe with ſucceſs in the field, the works will be unneceſſary;—if not, and he ſhould force us from hence, he will certainly poſſeſs himſelf of them. But, to prevent his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempting it now, I have directed the meadows on Province.
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:031423_0434_0FEC5E42236927B0"/>
Iſland to be overflowed immediately, and any other grounds that may be thought neceſſary for that purpoſe.—The works have been more peculiarly under the direction of monſieur Du Coudray, and I doubt not he will pay every attention to their completion and ſecurity, that the ſituation of affairs will admit of.</p>
                  <p>A part of the militia under general Armſtrong will be poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed along Schuylkill, to throw up redoubts at the different fords, which will be occaſionally occupied, whilſt I move to the other ſide with the main body of the army.—This diſpoſition appears to me the moſt eligible from a conſideration of all circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and better than if any part of our preſent force was to be employed at the forts.—If further reinforcements of the militia ſhould come in, they perhaps may be more properly aſſigned to that buſineſs than any we now have.</p>
                  <p>Your letter reſpecting general De Borre juſt now came to hand: I ſhall tranſmit him a copy of it and of the reſolution. There can be no court of inquiry into his conduct at this time: as ſoon as the ſtate of the army will admit, it will be held.</p>

                  <p>YOUR favor of yeſterday, with its ſeveral incloſures, came to hand laſt night.—Though I would willingly pay every attention to the reſolutions of Congreſs, yet, in the late inſtance reſpecting the recall of general Sullivan, I muſt beg leave to defer giving any order about it, till I hear further from that honorable body.—Our ſituation at this time is critical and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate; and nothing ſhould be done to add to its embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. We are now moſt probably on the point of another action: and to derange the army by withdrawing ſo many ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral officers from it, may and muſt be attended with many diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable if not ruinous conſequences. Such a proceeding at another time might not produce any bad effects: but how can the army be poſſibly conducted with a proſpect of ſucceſs, if the general officers are taken off in the moment of battle?—Congreſs may rely upon it, ſuch a meaſure will not promote but injure the ſervice.</p>
                  <p>It is not my wiſh to prevent or to delay a proper inquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to general Sullivan's conduct a ſingle inſtant, when the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the army will admit: but now they prohibit it, and (I think) the ſuſpenſion in his command alſo. The recall of general St. Clair obliged me to part with general Lincoln whom I could but ill ſpare; ſo that the whole charge of his di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion is now upon general Wayne, there being no other briga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dier in it than himſelf.—The Maryland troops, if general Sullivan is taken away, will not have one general officer, general Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood being at the head of the militia coming from that ſtate, and general De Borre ſuſpended:—added to this, colonel Giſt, who commands one regiment of them, is now from it by order.—In a word, ſir, whether the charges alledged againſt Sullivan are true or falſe, or whether his conduct has been exceptionable or not, I am ſatisfied the reſolution for his recall at this time was unhappily adopted, and, if carried into execution, will not fail to add new difficulties to our preſent diſtreſſes: and I am obliged to obſerve, in juſtice to my own character, that I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be anſwerable for the conſequences which may ariſe from a want of officers to aſſiſt me.</p>
                  <p>It gives me great pleaſure to find general Gates is on ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectable a footing; and I hope our affairs in that quarter, in the courſe of a little time, will be in as proſperous a train as we could reaſonably wiſh.</p>
                  <p>The main body of the enemy, from the beſt intelligence I have been able to get, lies near Dilworthtown, not far from the
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:031423_0436_0FEC5E486773B758"/>
field of action, where they have been buſily employed in bury<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing their dead, which, from accounts, amounted to a very conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable number.—We are moving up this road to get between the enemy and the Swedes' ford, and to prevent them from turning our right flank, which they ſeem to have a violent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination to effect, by all their movements.</p>
                  <p>I would beg leave to recommend in the moſt earneſt manner, that ſome board or committee be appointed, or ſome mode adopted, for obtaining ſupplies of blankets for the troops:—many are now without; and the ſeaſon becoming cold, they will be injured in their health, and unfitted for ſervice, unleſs they are immediately provided with them. Our ſupplies in this inſtance, as well as in every article of clothing, cannot be too great, as there are frequent loſſes not equally to be avoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—I would alſo obſerve that I think, in point of prudence and ſound policy, every ſpecies of proviſions ſhould be removed from the city, except ſuch as will be neceſſary to ſupply the preſent demands of this army. I have been told there are conſiderable quantities in private hands, which ſhould not be ſuffered to remain a moment longer than they can be conveyed away.</p>

                  <p>The enemy ſeem now to be ſtraining every nerve to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh their purpoſe: but I truſt, whatever preſent ſucceſs they may have, they will, ere long, experience a reverſe of fortune.—If they have four thouſand men in the Jerſeys, it is probable they have ſomething more ſerious in view than a mere diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion: but I am in hopes, when general M'Dougal comes to u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite his force with the militia, general Dickinſon will be ſtrong enough effectually to make head againſt them.</p>
                  <p>Yeſterday the enemy moved from Concord, by the Edgemont towards the Lancaſter road, with evident deſign to gain our right flank. This obliged us to alter our poſition and march to this place, from whence we intend immediately to proceed to War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wick.—We ſuffered much from the ſevere weather yeſterday and laſt night, being unavoidably ſeparated from our tents and baggage,—which not only endangers the health of the men, but has been very injurious to our arms and ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Theſe, when we arrive at Warwick, we ſhall endeavor, as ſoon as poſſible, to put again into a proper condition,—to do which, and to refreſh the men, are two principal motives for going there.</p>

that any conſiderable number had croſſed, that I found it in vain to think of overtaking their rear, with troops harraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as ours had been with conſtant marching ſince the battle of Brandiwine; and therefore concluded, by the advice of all the general officers, to march from this place to-morrow morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing towards Philadelphia, and on the way endeavor to form a junction with the continental troops under general M'Dougal from Peekſkill, and the Jerſey militia under general Dickinſon, both of whom are, I hope, on this ſide the Delaware.—I am al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo obliged to wait for general Wayne and general Smallwood, who were left upon the other ſide of Schuylkill, in hopes of falling upon the enemy's rear:—but they have eluded them as well as us.</p>
                  <p>When I laſt recroſſed the Schuylkill, it was with a firm in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent of giving the enemy battle wherever I ſhould meet them, and accordingly advanced as far as the Warren tavern upon the Lancaſter road, near which place the two armies were upon the point of coming to a general engagement, but were prevented by a moſt violent flood of rain, which continued all the day and following night. When it held up, we had the mortification to find that our ammunition, which had been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleted to forty rounds a man, was entirely ruined; and in that ſituation we had nothing left for it but to find out a ſtrong piece of ground which we could eaſily maintain till we could get the arms put into order, and a recruit of ammuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                  <p>Before this could be fully effected, the enemy marched from their poſition near the White-horſe tavern, down the road leading to the Swedes' Ford.—I immediately croſſed the Schuylkill above them, and threw myſelf full in their front, hoping to meet them in their paſſage, or ſoon after they had paſſed the river.—The day before yeſterday they were again in motion, and marched rapidly up the road leading towards Reading.—This induced me to believe that they had two ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in view,—one to get round the right of the army,—the other perhaps to detach parties to Reading where we had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable quantities of military ſtores.</p>
                  <p>To fruſtrate thoſe intentions, I moved the army up on this ſide the river to this place, determined to keep pace with them: but early this morning I received intelligence that they had croſſed the fords below.—Why I did not follow immediately, I have mentioned in the former part of my letter: but the ſtrongeſt reaſon againſt being able to make a forced march is the want of ſhoes. Meſſieurs Caroll, Chaſe, and Penn, who
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:031423_0439_0FEC5E55E777BAB0"/>
were ſome days with the army, can inform Congreſs in how deplorable a ſituation the troops are, for want of that neceſſary article. At leaſt one thouſand men are bare-footed, and have performed the marches in that condition. I was told of a great number of ſhoes in the hands of private people in Philadelphia, and ſent down to ſecure them: but I doubt the approach of the enemy will prevent it.</p>
                  <p>I have planned a method of throwing a garriſon into Fort Mifflin.—If it ſucceeds, and they, with the aſſiſtance of the ſhips and gallies, ſhould keep the obſtructions in the river, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Howe's ſituation in Philadelphia will not be the moſt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable: for if his ſupplies can be ſtopped by water, it may be eaſily done by land. To do both ſhall be my utmoſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor; and I am not yet without hope that the acquiſition of Philadelphia may, inſtead of his good fortune, prove his ruin.</p>
                  <p>General St. Clair, who has been conſtantly with the army for ſome time paſt, can give you many pieces of information which may have eſcaped me, and therefore I refer you to him for many particulars.</p>
                  <p>If there are any ſhoes and blankets to be had in Lancaſter or that part of the country, I earneſtly intreat you to have them taken up for the uſe of the army. I have been informed that there are large parcels of ſhoes in particular there.</p>
                  <p>Finding that the incloſed came from colonel Gibſon, I took the liberty of opening it, as I wanted much to know what route he was taking.</p>
                  <p>I have ordered all the Virginia militia who are tolerably armed to come forward and join the army. Thoſe who have no arms are to wait at Frederictown in Maryland till they hear whether any can be provided for them at Lancaſter: you will therefore be pleaſed to make enquiry what number can be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured there, and ſend an expreſs to Frederic with orders for as many men to come forward as there are arms.</p>

<pb n="144" facs="unknown:031423_0440_0FEC5E579D4A1F88"/>
though in general they had reached me before; and I flatter myſelf we ſhall ſoon hear that they have been ſucceeded by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fortunate and intereſting events, as the two armies, by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Gates's letter, were encamped near each other.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall pay due attention to the reſolution you refer me to; and no exertions on my part ſhall be wanting, to collect what neceſſaries I can for the army. This, I am perſuaded, will be equally attended to by the honorable board of war; and I hope, by care and induſtry, many ſupplies may be obtained to relieve our diſtreſſes, which, in the articles of ſhoes, ſtockings, and blankets, are extremely great.</p>
                  <p>Since my letter of the twenty-ninth, no favorable change has taken place in our affairs:—on the contrary, we have ſuſtained an additional loſs in the capture of the Delaware.

                  <p>HAVING received intelligence through two intercepted letters, that general Howe had detached a part of his force for the purpoſe of reducing Billingſport and the forts on the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware, I communicated the accounts to my general officers, who were unanimouſly of opinion that a favorable opportunity offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to make an attack upon the troops which were at and near Germantown. It was accordingly agreed that it ſhould take place yeſterday morning, and the following diſpoſitions were made.</p>
                  <p>The diviſions of Sullivan and Wayne, flanked by Conway's brigade, were to enter the town by the way of Cheſnut-hill, while general Armſtrong with the Pennſylvania militia ſhould fall down the Manatawny road by Vandeering's mill, and get upon the enemy's left and rear.—The diviſions of Greene and
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:031423_0441_0FEC5E5928765660"/>
Stephen, flanked by M'Dougal's brigade, were to enter, by taking a circuit by way of the lime-kiln road, at the market-houſe, and to attack their right wing; and the militia of Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land and Jerſey, under generals Smallwood and Forman, were to march by the old York road, and fall upon the rear of their right. Lord Stirling, with Naſh and Maxwell's brigades, was to form a corps-de-reſerve.</p>
                  <p>We marched about ſeven o'clock the preceding evening, and general Sullivan's advanced party, drawn from Conway's bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade, attacked their piquet at Mount Airy or Mr. Allen's houſe, about ſun-riſe the next morning, which preſently gave way; and his main body, conſiſting of the right wing, following ſoon, en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged the light infantry and other troops encamped near the piquet, which they forced from their ground.—Leaving their baggage, they retreated a conſiderable diſtance, having previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly thrown a party into Mr. Chew's houſe, who were in a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation not to be eaſily forced, and had it in their power, from the windows, to give us no ſmall annoyance, and in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure to obſtruct our advance.</p>
                  <p>The attack from our left column under general Greene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan about three-quarters of an hour after that from the right, and was for ſome time equally ſucceſsful. But I cannot enter upon the particulars of what happened in that quarter, as I am not yet informed of them with ſufficient certainty and preciſion.</p>
                  <p>The morning was extremely foggy, which prevented our im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proving the advantages we gained, ſo well as we ſhould other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe have done. This circumſtance, by concealing from us the true ſituation of the enemy, obliged us to act with more caution and leſs expedition than we could have wiſhed, and gave the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy time to recover from the effects of our firſt impreſſion and, what was ſtill more unfortunate, it ſerved to keep our dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent parties in ignorance of each other's movements, and hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their acting in concert. It alſo occaſioned them to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take one another for the enemy,—which, I believe, more than any thing elſe, contributed to the misfortune which enſued.—In the midſt of the moſt promiſing appearances, when every thing gave the moſt flattering hopes of victory, the troops began ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly to retreat, and entirely left the field, in ſpite of every ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that could be made to rally them.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole, it may be ſaid the day was rather unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate than injurious.—We ſuſtained no material loſs of men, and brought off all the artillery, except one piece which was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted.—The enemy are nothing the better by the event; and our troops, who are not in the leaſt diſpirited by it, have
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:031423_0442_0FEC5D73A21762F0"/>
gained what all young troops gain by being in actions. We have had however ſeveral valuable officers killed and wounded, particularly the latter. General Naſh is among the wounded, and his life is deſpaired of.—As ſoon as it is poſſible to obtain a return of our loſs, I will tranſmit it.</p>
                  <p>In juſtice to general Sullivan and the whole right wing of the army, whoſe conduct I had an opportunity of obſerving, as they acted immediately under my eye:—I have the pleaſure to inform you that both officers and men behaved with a degree of gallantry that did them the higheſt honor.</p>

                  <p>SINCE I had the honor of addreſſing you on the fifth, I have obtained a return of our loſs in the action on ſaturday, by which it appears to be much more conſiderable than I at firſt apprehended, though I always imagined myſelf that it was greater than it was generally ſuppoſed to be. The copy of the return incloſed will ſhew the amount as it now ſtands; but I hope many of thoſe who are miſſing will yet come in: I fear however there are ſeveral under that denomination to be added to the number of the ſlain, as the action was warm in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very quarter, from the information of the officers who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the different attacks.</p>
                  <p>What loſs the enemy ſuſtained, I am not able preciſely to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain: but from a variety of correſponding accounts of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who left the city ſince, and thoſe of a deſerter, it was very conſiderable. The deſerter, who is intelligent, ſays general Agnew was killed, ſir William Erſkine wounded in the head and leg, and that their general l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſs, in killed and wounded a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounted to near eight hundred. Several reputable perſons from the city corroborate this, particularly with reſpect to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Agnew's death: ſome ſay upwards of two hundred wag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons with wounded were carried in after the action, and before they came out, and that it was the common belief there, the enemy had been ſeverely handled.</p>
                  <p>It is with much chagrin and mortification I add, that every
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:031423_0443_0FEC5E612E83BED0"/>
account confirms the opinion I at firſt entertained, that our troops retreated at the inſtant when victory was declaring her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in our favor.—The tumult, diſorder, and even deſpair, which, it ſeems, had taken place in the Britiſh army, were ſcarcely to be paralleled: and it is ſaid, ſo ſtrongly did the ideas of a retreat prevail, that Cheſter was fixed on as their rendez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous. I can diſcover no other cauſe for not improving this happy opportunity, than the extreme hazineſs of the weather.</p>
                  <p>My intention is to encamp the army at ſome ſuitable place to reſt and refreſh the men, and recover them from the ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining effects of that diſorder naturally attendant on a retreat. We ſhall here wait for the reinforcements coming on, and ſhall then act according to circumſtances.—General Varnum, with the detachment from Peekſkill amounting to about twelve hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred, including officers, would be laſt night at Coryel's ferry. About five hundred militia from Virginia, and two hundred from Maryland, together with colonel Gibſon's ſtate regiment con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of two hundred and twenty-ſix effectives, have already joined the army.—Since the action, general Forman's brigade of Jerſey militia has quitted us. The men began to be uneaſy at their ſituation, and deſirous to return home: and as, by ſome intelligence received from general Dickinſon, there was reaſon to imagine there might be a call for their ſervices in the Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeys, it was thought expedient to gratify their deſire.</p>
                  <p>The ſtate of our water defence on the Delaware is far from being as flattering as could be wiſhed. After ſome ſlight oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition from the Jerſey militia under general Newcomb, a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of the enemy took poſſeſſion of Billingſport. This perhaps is an event of no material conſequence: but it is to be lamented that many of the officers and ſeamen on board the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies have manifeſted a diſpoſition that does them little honor. Looking upon their ſituation as deſperate, or probably from worſe motives, they have been guilty of the moſt alarming de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertions: two whole crews, including the officers, have deſerted to the enemy. I learn however by captain Brewer, who is this moment arrived here from the fleet, that the accounts they have received from the city, of our late attack, were ſuch as to have produced a favorable change, and to have inſpired them with more confidence.—I would here obſerve, that the charge of bad conduct was by no means applicable to the whole:—far from it.—He further adds that four of the enemy's ſhips made an attempt yeſterday morning to weigh the chevaux-de-friſe op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſite to Billingſport, but were repulſed by our gallies,—which has alſo contributed to raiſe the ſpirits of the ſeamen. Our
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:031423_0444_0FEC5E65C259F590"/>
garriſon on Fort-Iſland, conſiſting of little more than two hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred continental troops under lieutenant-colonel Smith, appear determined to maintain their poſts to the laſt extremity.</p>
                  <p>I beg leave to mention to Congreſs that there is a great defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of general officers to command this army. When the detachment coming from Peekſkill joins us, we ſhall have thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen brigades. Theſe require as many brigadiers, and ſix major-generals.—inſtead of theſe, we ſhall have only four major-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals and ſix brigadiers; and the deficiency will be ſtill increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the death of general Naſh, which, from every appearance, is momently to be expected. General Woodford's abſence, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by his wound, adds to our embarraſſments, though it will be but for a time. Under theſe circumſtances, Congreſs will be ſenſible that the government of the army cannot go on with that energy which is eſſential to its well-being and ſucceſs. Neither officers nor men will transfer the reſpect and obedience they pay to a general officer, to a colonel who happens to be appointed to the temporary command of a brigade; nor will he, knowing his authority to be only temporary, be as ſolicit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to inforce it as one who is conſcious he is to continue in the ſtation he fills. Want of leiſure prevents my being more parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular at this time: but I ſhall take the liberty, in a day or two, to point out the troops that are in want of general officers, with my obſervations on the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>I cannot however omit this opportunity of recommending ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral M'Dougal to their notice. This gentleman, from the time of his appointment as brigadier,—from his abilities, mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary knowledge, and approved bravery,—has every claim to promotion. If I miſtake not, he was paſſed over in the laſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment of major-generals, and younger officers preferred be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him: but his diſintereſted attachment to the ſervice pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented his acting in the manner that is cuſtomary in like cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. This, I think, gives him a peculiar title to eſteem, and concurs with the opinion I have of his value as an officer, to make me wiſh it may appear adviſable to Congreſs to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote him to one of the vacancies.</p>
                  <p>It would be well if the intended inquiry into the conduct of general St. Clair could be brought to a ſpeedy iſſue; and, if he is acquitted to the ſatisfaction of Congreſs, that, as his general character as an officer is good, he may be again reſtored to the ſervice.</p>
                  <p>By a letter this evening received from colonel Hawkes Hay of Haverſtraw, dated the fifth at four o'clock P. M. four ſhips of war, a conſiderable number of armed veſſels, eight tranſports,

                  <p>ON wedneſday evening I received the honor of your letter of the ſeventh with it ſeveral incloſures.—The providing of ſuitable quarters for the troops during the winter demands our attention: but I confeſs it is difficult to ſay where they will be. Sundry circumſtances may occur in the courſe of the campaign, to render any proviſion, which might now be thought of, alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether improper.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect to general Putnam's letter, though the accounts tranſmitted by colonel Hawkes Hay indicate that the enemy
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:031423_0446_0FEC5E68380A1990"/>
had ſome attack in contemplation, yet I cannot but think the force the general mentions to have been at New-York was greatly exaggerated. The higheſt number of the reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, ſaid to have arrived, is three thouſand; and theſe are mentioned to be half boys. Other reports make it much leſs,—and ſome as low as five or ſix hundred.—However, be it what it may, it is not in my power to grant him aid.—Had the rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement arrived before the troops marched from Peekſkill, ſo many might not have been ordered from thence. But the caſe was otherwiſe, or at leaſt I was not appriſed of their arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val; and the detachments from thence were directed by the advice of my general officers, who had under conſideration the ſtate of the whole force at that poſt and its dependencies, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to a general return. At the ſame time I urged general Putnam to call in all his out-poſts, and to write in preſſing terms to governor Trumbull to aſſiſt him with ſome militia.</p>
                  <p>I have not heard a ſingle ſyllable more of the troops or fleet mentioned by colonel Hawkes Hay, except a vague report to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day that a number, ſuppoſed to be about fifteen hundred, had landed on this ſide the river at Haverſtraw.—If the fact is ſo, it is probable they mean to paſs through the Clove and inveſt the forts.—I have great confidence in the activity and bravery of governor Clinton; and I truſt, if ſuch is their view, they will meet at leaſt with a ſpirited if not a ſucceſsful oppoſition.—I have ſent up lieutenant-colonel Radire, one of the engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers, with orders to direct ſuch other works as may appear neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>There was a very ſevere cannonade on wedneſday night: i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap> began about twelve o'clock, and continued till yeſterday morning between ſeven and eight. I have not learned the occaſion; but, from the direction, ſuppoſe it was at Fort-Mifflin, or an engagement between our armed veſſels and the enemy's ſhips, which probably were making a ſecond attempt againſt the che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaux-de-friſe.—I have determined to maintain the poſt at Red-bank, if it can be done, and have detached colonel Greene there with his regiment of Rhode-Iſland troops, conſiſting of about two hundred and twelve effective privates. I have alſo written to general Newcomb of Jerſey, preſſing him to give all the aid he can from the militia.</p>
                  <p>Since my letter of the ſeventh we have been joined by more of the Virginia militia.—The whole number now in camp a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounts to about eleven hundred. Many of their arms are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>different, and almoſt the whole are deſtitute of pouches and other neceſſary accoutrements.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="151" facs="unknown:031423_0447_0FEC5E7257100998"/>
On ſunday the enemy evacuated Billingſport.—They left all our cannon, but burned the platforms and carriages.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed you will receive a letter addreſſed to me by colonel Portail. Congreſs will judge of the contents, and decide upon them as they may think they merit.</p>
                  <p>The military cheſt is nearly exhauſted, not having more than ten thouſand dollars in it; and a large part of the army is to pay for the month of Auguſt. Beſides their claims, large ſums are wanted by the quarter-maſter general, and for other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.—Congreſs, I hope, will order ſuch immediate ſupply to be forwarded to the paymaſter-general, as ſhall be in their power.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>October</hi> 11.—I wiſh to know what ſtores of lead we have, and what expectations of further ſupplies. I am rather uneaſy on this head, as I have not been able to obtain ſatisfaction on ſome inquiries within the courſe of a few days.</p>
                  <p>The cannonade mentioned above was between our gallies and a detachment of the enemy who were attempting to throw up a battery at Webb's or the loweſt ferry on Schuylkill. It has been repeated this morning.—Their deſign, in erecting this battery, probably is to cover their paſſage to Province-Iſland, from whence, by occupying the grounds about the peſt-houſes, they may expect to annoy Fort-Mifflin.</p>
                  <p>Our diſtreſs for want of ſhoes and ſtockings is amazingly great, particularly for want of the former. On this account we have a great many men who cannot do duty, and ſeveral detained at the hoſpitals for no other cauſe.—I muſt requeſt Congreſs to continue their exertions to relieve us, and to direct every ſupply of theſe and other neceſſaries to be forwarded as ſoon as they poſſibly can after they are collected. It will be proper to ſend them on as faſt as they can be procured, without waiting to make up a conſiderable quantity to be brought at one time.</p>
                  <p>I was this morning honored with your favors of the ninth, and their ſeveral incloſures.—I feel in the moſt ſenſible manner the honorable approbation Congreſs have been pleaſed to give of my conduct, and that of the army under my command, in the action on the fourth inſtant: nor am I leſs indebted to you, ſir, for the polite mode in which you have conveyed their ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents.—I ſhall communicate the reſolve upon the ſubject to the army, and hope, if a favorable opportunity offers, under the ſmiles of providence, they will merit, by more ſubſtantial ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices, the further applauſe of their country.</p>

The reſolution of the eighth, for preventing ſupplies and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence being carried to the enemy, appears to me to be a ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutary one; and I hope it will be attended with the moſt bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial conſequences. That it may be known among the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants who are in their neighborhood, and who have been guilty of ſuch practices, I would wiſh to receive ſeveral printed copies, that they may be diſtributed in proper places.</p>

                  <p>SINCE I had the honor of addreſſing you on the eleventh inſtant, nothing material has happened between our army and general Howe's.—The incloſed copies of commodore. Hazle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wood and colonel Bradford's letters will ſhew the ſituation of affairs in the navy and at Fort-Mifflin, on the eleventh,—which are the lateſt accounts I have received from thence. But there has been a warm cannonade ever ſince, which continued, with but little intermiſſion, till between two and three o'clock yeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terday afternoon, when it ceaſed. The reſult I have not heard; but I hope, from the determined ſpirit of the fleet and the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſon, matters continue as we could wiſh.</p>
                  <p>I received an expreſs laſt night from general Putnam, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming me of the capture of Fort-Montgomery, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequent evacuation of Peekſkill. I ſhould ſend copies of his letters to me: but as the expreſs who brought them had diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches for Congreſs, I conclude he has adviſed them fully on the ſubject.—Theſe events may have an unhappy influence on our northern affairs: but as the Connecticut militia ſeem to be coming in faſt, and governor Clinton is exerting himſelf to bring out the force of New-York,—if general Putnam can but keep pace with their fleet in their progreſs up the river, I hope he will be able to fruſtrate their deſign of relieving general Burgoyne, and that every thing will ſtill terminate well in that quarter.</p>
                  <p>It gives me pain to repeat ſo often the wants of the army: and nothing would induce me to it but the moſt urgent neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Every mode hitherto adopted for ſupplying them has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved inadequate, notwithſtanding my beſt endeavors to make the moſt of the means which have been in my power.—The inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed return will ſhew how great our deficiency in the moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:031423_0449_0FEC5E76032AC2B0"/>
articles.—What new expedient Congreſs can deviſe for more effectually anſwering theſe demands, I know not, perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as I am that their cloſeſt attention has not been wanting to a matter of ſo great importance: but, circumſtanced as we are, I am under an abſolute neceſſity of troubling them, that if any new ſource can be opened for alleviating our diſtreſſes, it may be embraced as ſpeedily as poſſible; for it is impoſſible that any army, ſo unprovided, can long ſubſiſt, or act with that vigor which is requiſite to enſure ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>The return now incloſed is for troops preſent in camp,—be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides which, there are numbers in the ſeveral hoſpitals, totally deſtitute of the neceſſaries they require to ſit them for the field; and, on this account alone, are prevented from joining their corps. The recruits coming in are alſo in the ſame me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy predicament.—I cannot aſcertain with preciſion what quantity of clothing is at this time in Mr. Meaſe's hands: but, from every account, what he has can adminiſter but a very par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial relief.—I know he is entirely bare of ſome of the moſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital articles we want.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to cartouch-boxes, without which it is impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to act, I cannot find from my inquiries that there are any in ſtore. Several of the continental troops are deficient in this inſtance; and, what adds to our diſtreſs, there are but very few of the ſouthern militia that are provided.—I am trying to make a collection about the country: but, from the information I have received, the meaſure will be attended with but litle ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs.—This want, though not remedied immediately, may be removed in time; and I would take the liberty to recommend that the earlieſt attention ſhould be had to making a large ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply. I would alſo adviſe that much care ſhould be uſe in chuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the leather:—none but the beſt and thickeſt is proper for the purpoſe; and each box ſhould have a ſmall inner flap for the greater ſecurity of the cartridges againſt the rain and moiſt weather. The flaps in general are too ſmall, and do not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject ſufficiently over the ends or ſides of the boxes.—I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the utility, nay neceſſity, of theſe improvements, and that the adoption of them, though they will incur an additional expenſe at firſt, will prove a conſiderable ſaving, and of the moſt beneficial conſequences: for we know from unhappy ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience in the ſevere rain on the ſixteenth ultimo, the few boxes we had of this conſtruction preſerved the ammunition without injury, whilſt it was almoſt wholly deſtroyed in thoſe of the common form with a ſingle flap.</p>
                  <p>There is one thing more which I cannot omit mentioning to
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:031423_0450_0FEC5E780013B2F8"/>
Congreſs, and which, in my opinion, has a claim to their moſt ſerious attention,—I mean the general defective ſtate of the regiments which compoſe our armies.—Congreſs will find, from a view of the returns tranſmitted from time to time, that they do not amount to half of their juſt complement. What can be done to remedy this, I know not: but it is certain every idea of voluntary enliſtments ſeems to be at an end; and it is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly certain that the mode of draughting has been carried on with ſuch want of energy in ſome ſtates, and ſo much diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in others, that but a ſmall acceſſion of force has been deriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from it. Theſe facts are ſufficiently intereſting of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.—But there are others to be added.—I am told that Virginia, in her regulations for draughting, extended her plan only to the nine regiments that were firſt raiſed. In what po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy this was founded, I cannot determine: but the other ſix are to receive no reinforcements from that ſource.—Nor do matters ſtop here. The engagements of the firſt nine regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, I am informed, were temporary; and, according to the officers' accounts, the longeſt period to which any of the men are bound to ſerve is next April:—many are not obliged ſo long; and there are ſome who claim a diſcharge at this time.—I do not mention theſe things through choice, but from a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of duty, to the end that Congreſs may deviſe ſome timely and effectual proviſion for the whole, if ſuch ſhall be in their power.—It is unneceſſary to enlarge upon the ſubject; and I will only obſerve that the conſequences of calling the militia [<hi>into the field in</hi>] the courſe of the war have been ſo ſeverely and ruinouſly felt, that I truſt our views will never be turned to them but in caſes of the greateſt extremity.</p>
                  <p>In purſuance of the reſolution of Congreſs, a court of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry has ſat upon general Sullivan. They met on the tenth, and continued the examination till the twelfth, when they came to the incloſed opinion.—The depoſitions and papers which were before the court were many and prolix. They are not tranſmitted: but they may be obtained from the court, if want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—Beſides the depoſitory proofs which they had of wounded and dead officers, they had many gentlemen before them in perſon.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE been duly honored with your favors of the twelfth and thirteenth inſtant, with their ſeveral incloſures.—In reſpect to the reſolution directing a flag to be ſent to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Howe, I am inclined to think that the information upon which it was framed was without foundation. The letters which have come from our officers who have been lately taken gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally mention that their treatment has been tolerably good; and ſuch privates as have eſcaped have ſaid nothing in the courſe of their examination of their having been compelled to work.—For theſe reaſons I have taken the liberty to decline ſending the flag. At the ſame time Congreſs may be aſſured, if our priſoners ſuffer any wrongs, I ſhall take every means in my power to have them redreſſed as ſoon as I am appriſed of them.</p>
                  <p>It is with the higheſt ſatisfaction I congratulate Congreſs on the ſucceſs of our arms at the northward in the action of the ſeventh,—an event of the moſt intereſting importance at this critical juncture. From the happy train in which things then were, I hope we ſhall ſoon hear of the moſt deciſive advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages.</p>
                  <p>We moved this morning from the encampment at which we had been for ſix or ſeven days paſt, and are juſt arrived at the grounds we occupied before the action of the fourth. One mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for coming here is to divert the enemy's attention and force from the forts. Theſe they ſeem to conſider as capital objects, and (from their operations) mean to reduce, if poſſible.—At preſent their deſigns are directed againſt Fort-Mifflin and the chevaux-de-friſe. I have therefore detached a further rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcement to the garriſon.</p>
                  <p>I yeſterday, through the hands of Mrs. * * *, received a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of a very curious and extraordinary nature from Mr. D* * *, which I have thought proper to tranſmit to Congreſs. To this ridiculous, illiberal performance, I made a ſhort reply, by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiring the bearer of it, if ſhe ſhould hereafter by any accident meet with Mr. D* * *, to tell him I ſhould have returned it unopened, if I had any idea of the contents;—obſerving at
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:031423_0452_0FEC5E84D8B94CC8"/>
the ſame time, that I highly diſapproved the intercourſe ſhe ſeemed to have been carrying on, and expected it would be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continued.—Notwithſtanding the author's aſſertion, I cannot but ſuſpect that the meaſure did not originate with him; and that he was induced to it by the hope of eſtabliſhing his inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt and peace more effectually with the enemy.</p>

                  <p>I LAST night had the honor to receive your letter of the ſeventeenth inſtant, with its ſeveral incloſures.</p>
                  <p>I heartily wiſh the ſtates may feel the importance of filling their battalions, and may, in conſequence of the recommenda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Congreſs, adopt ſuch meaſures as will prove effectual for the purpoſe. I cannot but think that heretofore there has been a want of attention in this inſtance, and that the ſubject, though intereſting to the laſt degree, has been viewed with too much indifference. The reſolutions reſpecting deſert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, I hope, will alſo have their notice. It is highly neceſſary that they ſhould come into ſome regulations for apprehending them, and puniſhing thoſe who give them countenance. If this is not done, our force will be always diminiſhing, and no exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the army will prevent it. I ſhall try the effects of a proclamation on thoſe who are now delinquents, and ſhall be happy if it meets with ſucceſs; but confeſs, from the experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment I have made, that I am not ſanguine in my expectations that it will be the caſe.</p>
                  <p>As to the recruiting officers, I muſt obſerve, that, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the reſolution of Congreſs of the thirty-firſt of July, and my circular letter on the ſubject of it to many of the ſtates, I have not received an account that any officers have been ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, except in Connecticut and Jerſey.</p>
                  <p>On ſunday the enemy evacuated Germantown, and withdrew themſelves within their lines near the city. They ſeem deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to reduce the forts, if poſſible; and, for this purpoſe, have thrown ſeveral parties over on Province-Iſland. I was informed this afternoon that a detachment alſo paſſed the Dela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ware at Cooper's ferry in the morning. If the account be true (and I have no doubt of it) it is highly probable they mean to make an attack upon the garriſon at Red-bank. I am taking
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:031423_0453_0FEC5E86C0FB7AE8"/>
every meaſure in my power to counteract them, and have writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten to generals Forman and Newcomb of Jerſey to afford every aid they can to relieve the fort, in caſe they do inveſt it.</p>
                  <p>Againſt Fort-Mifflin they have kept up a cannonade, more or leſs every day, and have thrown ſeveral ſhells, but without do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any conſiderable damage. The exploſion of one killed a private, and wounded three others, who were in a barrack where it fell. They alſo ſet fire to two ammunition-boxes with a hot ball on the nineteenth, which did ſome injury to the barracks. I do not recollect that we have ſuffered lately in any inſtances beſides theſe.</p>

                  <p>By colonel Blaine, one of the iſſuing commiſſaries, who left Red-bank in the morning before the action, I am happily in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed that he had thrown conſiderable ſupplies of proviſion into both garriſons. He alſo adds that he came from Jerſey this morning, and that the enemy had recroſſed the Delaware and returned to Philadelphia. I have written to colonel Greene that the priſoners muſt be immediately ſent from his poſt: and Mr. Clymer, a deputy under Mr. Boudinot, will ſet out to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow morning to make a proper diſpoſition of them.</p>
                  <p>It gives me great concern to inform Congreſs, that, after all my exertions, we are ſtill in a diſtreſſed ſituation for want of blankets and ſhoes. At this time no inconſiderable part of our force are incapable of acting, through the deficiency on the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter: and I fear, without we can be relieved, it will be the caſe with two-thirds of the army in the courſe of a few days.</p>
                  <p>I am and have been waiting with the moſt anxious impatience for a confirmation of general Burgoyne's ſurrender. I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived

                  <p>I WAS duly honored with Mr. Hancock's letter of the twenty-fifth, with its ſeveral incloſures.—I ſhall take the caſe of John More under conſideration; and will tranſmit colonel Maſon my determination upon the ſame.</p>
                  <p>At this time I cannot inform the commiſſary whether any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations have or have not been made by general orders in the original ration eſtabliſhment. I have been under the neceſſity, from time to time, to ſend away my orderly books; and they are neceſſary to be examined on the ſubject. However, I think it probable that a departure from the firſt allowance may have been found expedient, and directed by ſome authority,—or the commiſſary would not have adopted it.—In reſpect to the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration referred to my conſideration, it is a matter of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, and I have deſired the general officers to inform them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves whether it will be agreeable to the army at large, or what other regulations may be neceſſary in this inſtance.—As ſoon as I have their ſentiments, I will write to Congreſs upon the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>The enemy ſtill conſider the poſſeſſion of our poſts upon the river of great importance; and, from their preparations of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcines, &amp;c. and the beſt information I have been able to obtain, they will make further efforts to carry them.—Viewing them in this light myſelf, and imagining that they would perſevere in their plans to occupy them, I wrote ſome days ago in the moſt preſſing terms to generals Dickinſon, Forman, and * * *, to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford every aid in their power from the militia of New-Jerſey. As yet we have received but little; and I have no encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to expect that it will be much augmented in a ſhort time. This does not proceed from a want of activity and exertion on the part of the two firſt-mentioned gentlemen, whoſe conduct and zea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="159" facs="unknown:031423_0455_0FEC5E8A1F501918"/>
from Staten-Iſland keep a large proportion of the militia from the eaſtern and upper part of the ſtate almoſt, conſtantly employed at and in the neighborhood of Elizabethtown, and Mr. Livingſton's powers, as governor, being expired,—and no proviſion made (it ſeems) for ſuch a contingency,—there are none of ſufficient authority to order them out, till a new ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment can be had:—at leaſt there is ground to ſuſpect that the orders and exertions of theſe two gentlemen, unaſſiſted by civil authority, will not be attended with the advantages we wiſh, and which our affairs require. * * *</p>
                  <p>Under theſe circumſtances I have been obliged to detach a further reinforcement of continental troops under general Var<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, to maintain the two garriſons, if poſſible,—beſides ſailors drawn from the line, to man the gallies. This detachment, when it arrives, added to the force now in the forts, will make the whole amount to ſixteen hundred effective rank and file ſent from this army.</p>
                  <p>After the action of the fourth ultimo at Germantown, I hop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed we ſhould have been in a ſituation to attack the enemy again on thoſe grounds, and with more ſucceſs than in the former in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: but this I was not able to effect. The ſevere rain on the ſixteenth of September,—the action on the fourth,—the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moval of our ſtores, and having to form a new elaboratory,—added to the ſmall number of hands engaged in the buſineſs of it,—laid us under difficulties in the capital and eſſential article of ammunition, that could not be ſurmounted. Every exertion was directed to obtain ſupplies; but (notwithſtanding) they were inadequate, too ſcanty, and inſufficient to attempt any thing on a large and general ſcale, before the enemy withdrew themſelves. With what we had, in caſe an experiment had been made, fortune might have decided in our favor for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent; but we ſhould not have been afterwards in a ſituation to maintain the advantage we might have gained: and if a repulſe had taken place, and the enemy purſued,—for want of a reſerve, we might have been expoſed to the moſt imminent danger of being ruined.—The diſtreſs of the ſoldiers for want of ſhoes was alſo a powerful obſtacle to the meaſure.</p>
                  <p>I could wiſh that our circumſtances were now ſuch as to au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſe a general attack for diſlodging them from the city: but I think that they are not. This alſo is the opinion of my general officers, upon a full and comprehenſive view of matters, as Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs will perceive by the incloſed copy of the minutes of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil on the twenty-ninth ultimo, which I have taken the liberty to tranſmit and lay before them.—The ſuperiority of numbers
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:031423_0456_0FEC5E8C0C2E8F90"/>
the part of the enemy, in reſpect to regular troops,—their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior diſcipline, and the redoubts and lines which they have thrown up between the two rivers and about the city,—the happy ſtate of our affairs at the northward, and the practicabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of drawing ſuccours from thence, the conſequences of a defeat,—theſe were all motives which led to a deciſion againſt an attack at this time.</p>
                  <p>I have ſent colonel Hamilton, one of my aides to general Gates, to give him a juſt repreſentation of things, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain to him the expediency of our receiving the reinforce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which have been determined neceſſary, if they will not interfere with and fruſtrate any important plans he may have formed. Indeed I cannot conceive that there is any object now remaining, that demands our attention and moſt vigorous efforts ſo much as the deſtruction of the army in this quarter. Should we be able to effect this, we ſhall have little to fear in future.</p>
                  <p>General Howe's force, according to the ſtate now made, is more conſiderable than it was generally ſuppoſed to be. I did not think it quite ſo great myſelf, but always imagined the common eſtimate much too low:—nor can I poſitively ſay what it really is. However, there are ſtrong reaſons to believe that it is not over-rated. After the evacuation of Germantown, an almoſt infinite number of ſcraps and bits of paper were found, which, being ſeparated and arranged with great induſtry and care, bear the marks of genuine and authentic returns at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent periods. The manner in which they were deſtroyed and diſpoſed of gives no room to ſuſpect that it was the effect of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign.—In addition to this, I am informed by general Putnam that he had heard a reinforcement of four regiments was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing round to Delaware from New-York.</p>
                  <p>The incloſed return will give Congreſs a general view of the ſtrength of this army when it was made, and a particular one of the forces of each ſtate which compoſe it. By this they will perceive how greatly deficient the whole are in furniſhing their juſt quotas.—The militia from Maryland and Virginia are no longer to be counted on:—all the former, except about two hundred, are already gone; and a few days, I expect, will produce the departure of the whole or chief part of the latter, from the importunate applications which ſome of them have made. Beſides this diminution, I am apprehenſive we ſhall have ſeveral men added to the ſick liſt by reaſon of the late exceſſive rain and want of clothes.</p>
                  <p>We have not yet come to any determination reſpecting the
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:031423_0457_0FEC5D93AB1071D0"/>
diſpoſition of our troops for the winter,—ſuppoſing it a matter of great importance, and that for the preſent we ſhould be ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent upon it. The reaſons will readily occur. By continuing the campaign, perhaps many ſalutary if not deciſive advantages may be derived; but it appears to me that this muſt depend upon the ſupplies of clothing which the men receive. If they cannot be accommodated in this inſtance, it will be difficult if not impoſſible to do it without effecting their deſtruction.</p>
                  <p>I would take the liberty to mention that I feel myſelf in a delicate ſituation with reſpect to the marquis La Fayette.—He is extremely ſolicitous of having a command equal to his rank, and profeſſes very different ideas, as to the purpoſes of his appointment, from thoſe Congreſs have mentioned to me:—he certainly did not underſtand them.—I do not know in what light they will view the matter: but it appears to me, from a conſideration of his illuſtrious and importortant connections,—the attachment which he has manifeſted for our cauſe,—and the conſequences which his return in diſguſt might produce,—that it will be adviſable to gratify him in his wiſhes; and the more ſo, as ſeveral gentlemen from France, who came over un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſome aſſurances, have gone back diſappointed in their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations.—His conduct with reſpect to them ſtands in a favor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able point of view,—having intereſted himſelf to remove their uneaſineſs, and urged the impropriety of their making any unfa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable repreſentations upon their arrivil at home: and in all his letters, he has placed our affairs in the beſt ſituation he could.—Beſides, he is ſenſible, diſcreet in his manners, has made great proficiency in our language, and, from the diſpoſition he diſcovered at the battle of Brandiwine, poſſeſſes a large ſhare of bravery and military ardor.</p>
                  <p>There is a French gentleman here,—monſieur Vrigny,—in whoſe favor the marquis ſeems much intereſted. He aſſures me he is an officer of great merit, and, from that motive and a regard to the ſervice, wiſhes to ſee him promoted. The rank he holds in France, and his preſent expectations, are contained in the incloſed copy of a paper given me by the marquis, Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Vrigny alſo has honorable certificates of his ſervices, near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly correſponding with the maquis's account of them.—If Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs are pleaſed to honor him with a commiſſion in the army of the ſtates, I muſt try to employ him.</p>
                  <p>I took the liberty ſome ſhort time ago to mention to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs the ſituation of the nine firſt-raiſed Virginia regiments, and the term for which they ſtand engaged; and; conſidering that we ſhould ſuffer greatly by the loſs of ſo large a part of
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:031423_0458_0FEC5E90233B5538"/>
our force which have been long inured to ſervice, I thought it adviſable to conſult the officers commanding them, upon the mode which ſhould appear to them beſt calculated to re-enliſt them. They accordingly met, and reported their ſentiments in writing, a copy of which I have encloſed.—I do not know that expedients, more promiſing of ſucceſs than thoſe they have pointed out, can be adopted.—Congreſs will be pleaſed to give the matter their earlieſt attention, and to favor me with their opinion by the firſt opportunity, whether the indulgence and allowance they have propoſed may be granted.—and, if any additional bounty may be given, what it ſhall be.—The high ſums paid for ſubſtitutes and draughts, of late, even in the mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litia ſervice, will make this neceſſary: for the ſoldiers, being well app riſed of that fact, will not be induced to engage again during the war or for three years, for the uſual premium.</p>
                  <p>I would alſo lay before Congreſs a remonſtrance by the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altern officers of the Virginia line, founded on a reform I thought neceſſary to take place in the regiments from that ſtate. Theſe, in their eſtabliſhment, were made to conſiſt of ten companies,—two more than were aſſigned to thoſe of the ſtates in general. This, and the great diſproportion between the officers and men, induced me to reduce them to a level with the reſt belonging to the continent, in order to prevent, a conſiderable unneceſſary expenſe.—To effect this, no new promotions are to be made in the two extra companies, <abbr>viz.</abbr> the ninth and tenth, either to vacancies exiſting at the time of the regulation, or to any fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ones that may happen therin: and the ſubalterns are to remain in their rank and command, till they can be promoted in the other eight companies, and their men incorporated.—This is what they complain of.—<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrance as they ſhall think proper.</p>
                  <p>At the requeſt of governor Clinton I have tranſmitted a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of his letter to me, giving an account of general Vaughan's expedition up the North-river after the capture of Fort-Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gomery, and the deſtruction committed by his troops in burning Kingſton and the houſes and mills on the river.—According to the lateſt advices, they have returned again; and it is reported that they have deſtroyed the barracks and forts, and gone to New-York:—but this is not confirmed.</p>
                  <p>A few days ago, Mr. Franks of Philadelphia, agent for the Britiſh priſoners, ſent out ſix thouſand continental dollars to Mr. Richard Graham of Virginia, for the ſubſiſtence of the Heſſian and other priſoners in that ſtate. The policy of ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:031423_0459_0FEC5E95743E09E8"/>
the enemy to ſupport their priſoners with money which they refuſe themſelves, and which they attempt to depreciate in every inſtance they poſſibly can, appears to me very queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onable,—and the more ſo, as it may be counterfeited.—Beſides, they have laid us under every difficulty they can deviſe, as to our priſoners in their hands:—nothing will do for their ſupport but hard money.—If the enemy were obliged to furniſh the ſame, the quanity with us would be greater, and of courſe the means of relieving ours, eaſier. I do not know what conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences a prohibition againſt receiving continental money or the currency of any ſtate from them might involve: I think the ſubject is worthy of the conſideration of Congreſs; and for that reaſon I have mentioned it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>November</hi> 3.—The report of the enemy's having deſtroyed the forts and barracks on the North-river, and of their having returned to New-York, is confirmed. I this morning received a letter from general Putnam upon the ſubject, a copy of which is tranſmitted.—The information that they mean to reinforce general Howe, I doubt not, is true: it has come through ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral channels, and nothing is more probable.—As to their hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a further expedition in view, it ſeems to be queſtionable:—general Burgoyne's defeat, and the eaſtern troops being ready to be employed in another way, are circumſtances againſt the meaſure.</p>
                  <p>Agreeable to my expectation, the Virginia militia are gone: ſo that we have none now in aid of the continental troops, but thoſe of this ſtate mentioned in the return, and a few from Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ryland. I do not know what can or will be done to obtain further reinforcements of them: but it appears to me, taking matters in any point of light, that further aids ſhould come from Virginia and Maryland: for, ſhould we be able to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modate the continental forces with clothes ſo as to carry on a winter campaign, their aſſiſtance will be material, either to maintain a blockade, or in any deciſive ſtroke we may attempt. And if they cannot be ſo provided, and we ſhould be obliged to retire into quarters, their ſervice will be ſtill more neceſſary to aſſiſt in covering the country againſt incurſions for forage and proviſions. The militia of this ſtate, themſelves, ſuppoſing they ſhould be tolerably vigorous in their exertions, will not be equal to the taſk: at leaſt it will be difficult, if not imprac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable, for them to do it. It is to be wiſhed that ſuch as can be drawn out may be engaged to ſerve three months, or two at leaſt (if it can be effected), after their arrival in camp; and that a mode could be adopted to ſupply their places with others
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:031423_0460_0FEC5E9C05EC4FC8"/>
at the expiration of their term, ſhould the exigency of our af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs require it. A time for their continuance ſhould be fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or they will always be uneaſy and puſhing off; and the longer circumſtances will admit it to be, the better: for, after the period recurs, for which they come. it will be impoſſible to retain, them a moment. As to the number that ſhould be required, it is difficult to determine: however, it is likely it will fall ſhort of the requiſition, as it ever has upon ſuch oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions.</p>
                  <p>There is a report prevailing in camp, which has come through ſeveral channels, that a ſucceſsful expedition has been made upon Rhode-Iſland, and eight hundred priſoners taken, with ſeveral pieces of artillery, and a large quantity of ſalt.—I heartily wiſh it may be true: but at preſent it wants confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation</p>
                  <p>Mr. Thompſon's letter of the twenty-firſt ultimo, with its incloſures, came to hand yeſterday. I join Congreſs moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely in congratulations on our important ſucceſs in the ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>render of general Burgoyne at the head of his forces, and am happy they have received a confirmation of the event from gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Gates.</p>

                  <p>I DO myſelf the honor to incloſe you an extract a letter from major-general Dickinſon, of the ſixth inſtant, by which it appears that a reinforcement has ſailed from New-York, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from general Howe or ſome other expedition. I have not yet head whether any of the troops on their march from the northward have yet croſſed the North-river: but I hope they will be with me near as ſoon as general Howe's reinforcement can arrive at Philadelphia.</p>
                  <p>There was a heavy firing of cannon all the day of the fifth, down the river; and in the evening ſome muſketry was heard; from whence we concluded that an attack had been made upon Fort-Mifflin. But it turned out to be an attack made by ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Varnum, with a twelve and an eighteen-pounder fixed near Red-bank, upon the enemy's ſhips. He thinks he damag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Somerſet of ſixty-four guns conſiderably, as ſhe got on ground, and was for ſome time expoſed to his fire. The ſhips were obliged to quit their ſtations and fall lower down.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="165" facs="unknown:031423_0461_0FEC5D6C21A2A438"/>
From a variety of accounts and circumſtances, I am induced to believe that the enemy are miditating a grand blow againſt Fort-Mifflin. I have put the place in as good a ſtate of defence as my preſent numbers will admit, and have directed general Varnum to afford every further aſſiſtance in his power. I therefore hope they will meet a warm reception whenever they make the attempt.</p>
                  <p>The military cheſt is again empty, and the army is unpaid for the months of September and October,—beſides the draughts that are requiſite for the commiſſary and quarter-maſter-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral's department. You will therefore be pleaſed to direct a ſupply of caſh to be ſent on as expediouſly as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>I fear, from a letter which I have lately received from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Heath, that no proper meaſures are taken to put up a ſupply of ſalt proviſions for next campaign, to the eaſtward. I have incloſed a copy of general Heath's letter to Mr. Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanan, the commiſſary-general of purchaſes, and have deſired him to have the matter looked into in time: but is of ſo much importance to the very exiſtence of the army, that I think it deſerves the attention of Congreſs.</p>

Among thoſe of the former, I found the reſolution you are pleaſed to allude to, reſpecting your appointment as preſident. <g ref="char:punc">▪</g>Permit me, ſir, to congratulate you upon this event, and to aſſure you I have the moſt entire confidence that I ſhall experience in you during your preſidency the ſame politeneſs, and attention to the intereſts of the ſtates, that marked the conduct of your worthy predeceſſor.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the views of the navy-board for ſecuring the frigates, the ſituation of the army would not admit of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with them, ſuppoſing they would anſwer the end. I have therefore written to te board in the moſt preſſing terms, to have the frigates ſcuttled in ſuch way that they may be raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed when it ſhall be neceſſary, and that in the mean time they may not be liable to injury from floating ice.—I ſee no mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſo likely to ſecure them to us, and againſt the enemy's at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts.—
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:031423_0462_0FEC5EA149FB5FC8"/>
I have been extremely fearful they would have poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed and employed them, with the Delaware and their batte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, on the rear of the gallies and the fort, while the ſhips be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low attacked in front. I need not point out the probable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of ſuch an event: they are too obvious.</p>
                  <p>The reſolves which you requeſt to be communicated to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhall be publiſhed in general orders.—The letters for com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modore Hazlewood, &amp;c. have been put in a proper channel of conveyance.</p>
                  <p>As to the diſpoſition of part of the northern army, my letter of the firſt, continued to the third, contains my ideas upon the ſubject, and thoſe my general officers. I ſhall be ſorry if the meaſures I have taken on this head ſhould interfere with or materially vary from any plans Congreſs might have had in view. Their proceedings of the fifth, I preſume, were founded on a ſuppoſition that the enemy were ſtill up the North-river, and garriſoning the forts they had taken.—This not being the caſe, and all accounts agreeing that reinforcements to general Howe are coming from York, I hope the aides I have requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed will be conſidered expedient and proper. Independent of the latter conſideration, I think our exertions and force ſhould be directed to effect general Howe's deſtruction if it is poſſible.</p>
                  <p>Among the various difficulties attenting the army the adjuſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of rank is not the leaſt. This,—owing to the ſeveral modes, the ſeverel principles, that have prevailed in granting commiſſions,—is involving in great perplexity. The officers of the Pennſylvania troops are in much confuſion about it: in many inſtances, thoſe who were junior in rank, from local and other circumſtances, have obtained commiſſions older in date than thoſe which were granted afterwards to officers, their ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periors before. This, with many other irregularies, has been and is the cauſe of great uneaſineſs: and, though precedency of rank ſo claimed ſhould not be ſupported in juſtice or upon any principle,—we find all, having the leaſt pretext for the title, ſtrenuous to ſupport it, and willing to hold a ſuperiority. I was therefore induced to order a board of officers to take the matter under conſideration. The reſult, reſpecting the field-officers of this ſtate, I now incloſe, and wiſh Congreſs to adopt the regulation which the board have made, and to tranſmit me, by the earlieſt opportunity, commiſſions dated according to their arrangement. At the ſame time it may be proper that there ſhould be a reſolve vacating the commiſſions they now have, and directing them to be delivered to me. Their atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:031423_0463_0FEC5EA51D532BF0"/>
to this buſineſs, I truſt, will be immediate: the diſputes and jealouſies with the officers require it.</p>
                  <p>I have incloſed the memorial of colonel Portail and the other engineers for their promotion, referred to me by the board of war for my ſentiments.—As to the terms theſe gentlemen men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to have been propoſed and agreed to when they firſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived. I know nothing of them further than the memorial ſtates. In reſpect to their abilities and knowledge in their profeſſion, I muſt obſerve they have had no great opportunity of proving them ſince they were in our ſervice. However, I have reaſon to believe that they have been regularly bred in this important branch of war, and that their talents, which have been hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, as it were, dormant, want only a proper occaſion to call them forth; in which caſe, I have no doubt they would do themſelves honor, and the ſtates eſſential ſervice.—It is of great import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, too, to conſider the practicability of replacing theſe gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlemen with perſons equally qualified, if they ſhould quit the ſervice; and how indiſpenſable men of ſkill in this branch of military ſcience are to every army. While I am on this ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, I would take the liberty to mention that I have been well informed that the engineer in the northern army (Corieſki, I think, his name is) is a gentleman of ſcience and merit. From the character I have had of him, he is deſerving of notice too.</p>
                  <p>I would beg leave to mention that we are in great diſtreſs for want of money. This will be more urgent every day: and it is probable there will be a great deal of pay due to the troops coming to reinforce us.—General Putnam writes preſſingly for a ſupply, and ſays he is in a moſt diſagreeable ſituation for the want of it.—I muſt requeſt the attention of Congreſs to this ſubject.</p>
                  <p>Your favor of the ſeventh came to hand this morning. I ſhall pay proper attention to the incloſures.—The rank of the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of cavalry I will attempt to have ſettled as ſoon as circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances will admit.</p>
                  <p>I have nothing very intereſting to communicate.—The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my have loſt one of their new floating batteries: it ſunk in a little time after it was launched. There has been a cannonade to-day:—it ſtill continues:—I do not know the occaſion, but imagine it is between the ſhips and gallies.</p>

                  <p>The condition of the army for want of clothes and blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets,—and the little proſpect I have of obtaining relief, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the information I have received from the board of war,—occaſion me to trouble you at this time. The mode of ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and forcing ſupplies from the inhabitants, I fear, would prove very inadequate to the demands, while it would certainly embitter the minds of the people, and excite perhaps a hurtful jealouſy againſt the army. I have had officers out for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of purchaſing and making voluntary collections of necſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries; and, in a few inſtances, more coercive meaſures have been exerciſed: but all theſe have proved of little avail: our diſtreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes ſtill continue, and are becoming greater. I would therefore humbly ſubmit it to the conſideration of Congreſs whether it may not be expedient for them to addreſs the ſeveral legiſlative and executive powers of the ſtates on this ſubject as early as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and in the moſt urgent terms. It appears to me, if they were to appoint, under the authority of Congreſs, proper active agents, that many neceſſaries might be procured in addition to thoſe [<hi>purchaſed</hi>] on public account. Beſides this, I think the exigency of our affairs requires that they ſhould reſove on an immediate aſſeſſment to be made on the inhabitants.—If theſe modes were adopted, conſiderable aids might be derived, and in a way much leſs exceptionable than that of ſeizing by the army. The aſſemblies in many ſtates, I believe, are now ſitting; and I have no doubt, upon a requiſition by Congreſs, but they will give attention to the meaſure.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed you will receive a copy of a letter from general Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam, which came to hand to-day. You will find his and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor Clinton's opinion reſpecting the fortifications neceſſary to be made for the ſecurity of the North-river. As ſoon as I heard that Warner's militia were coming down to reinforce me, I immediately wrote to countermand them, and directed that they ſhould be retained to carry on the neceſſary works during the time they are to ſerve.—My letter on this ſubject was on the ninth inſtant.—As to the other troops, the propriety of bringing them here, I believe, is not to be queſtioned. We are told through various channels that ſir Henry Clinton is coming round with all the force that can poſſibly be ſpared from New-York; and it is ſaid that thoſe on Staten-Iſland are withdrawn. It is added alſo that the inhabitants of the former are greatly alarmed and diſguſted, and that general Tryon is calling in the militia of Long-Iſland for the defence of the city. General Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nam's

                  <p>I have alſo the honor to tranſmit you a copy of a report by a board of general officers, on the ſubject of rations, which I ſubmit to the conſideration of Congreſs. The eſtabliſhment and regulations which they propoſe appear to me to be juſt and neceſſary, ſuppoſing the commiſſary's eſtimate to be right, which I preſume is the caſe, from the exorbitant price which has been and is now paid for every ſpecies of proviſion.—The neceſſity of an alteration in the former value has been long urged by many officers; and, for want of it, ſeveral, I believe, have left the ſervice:</p>

                  <p>I AM ſorry to inform you that Fort-Mifflin was evacuat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the night before laſt, after a defence which does credit to the American arms, and will ever reflect the higheſt honor up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the officers and men of the garriſon. The works were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely beat down, every piece of cannon diſmounted, and one of the enemy's ſhips ſo near that ſhe threw grenades into the fort, and killed men upon the platforms, from her tops, before they quitted the iſland. This ſhip had been cut down for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, and ſo conſtructed that ſhe made but a ſmall draught of water, and by theſe means warped in between Fort-Mifflin and Province-Iſland. Some complaints are made that the captains of the gallies did not ſufficiently exert themſelves to drive this veſſel from her ſtation: but I ſhall not determine any thing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the matter till a proper enquiry is made.</p>
                  <p>Nothing in the courſe of this campaign has taken up ſo much of the attention and conſideration of myſelf and all the general officers, as the poſſibility of giving a further relief to Fort-Mif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flin
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:031423_0466_0FEC5EABAF3E4CA0"/>
than what we had already afforded. Such a garriſon was thrown into it as has been found by experience capable of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending it to the laſt extremity: and Red-bank, which was deemed eſſentially neceſſary, not only for the purpoſe of keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing open the communication, but of annoying the enemy's ſhips and covering our own fleet, has been poſſeſſed by a conſiderable detachment from this army. The only remaining and practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble mode of giving relief to the fort was by diſlodging the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from Province-Iſland, from whence they kept up an inceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant fire. But this, from the ſituation of the ground, was not to be attempted with any degree of ſafety to the attacking par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, without the whole or a conſiderable part of the army ſhould be removed to the weſt ſide of Schuylkill to ſupport and co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver it.</p>
                  <p>To account for this, you muſt be made acquainted with the nature of the ground. In order to have made the attack upon Province-Iſland, the party deſtined for that purpoſe,—which ſhould have been at leaſt fifteen hundred,—muſt have marched down the Cheſter road as far as the Bell inn near Derby, and thence, turning towards Delaware, muſt have proceeded about four miles further through a neck of land, to the iſland. The enemy have a bridge at the middle ferry upon Schuylkill, which is but four miles from the Bell inn; conſequently, by throwing a body of men over that bridge upon the firſt diſcovery of our deſign, and marching down to the Bell, they would have effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually cut off our detachment upon their return.—It is true the covering party might have conſiſted of a leſs number than the whole army: but then thoſe remaining upon this ſide the river would have been too few to have been intruſted with all the artillery and ſtores of the army, within twelve miles of the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy.</p>
                  <p>There were many and very forcible reaſons againſt a total re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move to the weſt ſide of Schuylkill. Leaving all our ſtores at Eaſton, Bethlehem, and Allentown, uncovered,—and abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeveral of our hoſpitals within reach of the enemy,—firſt preſented themſelves. Another, and in my opinion a more weighty reaſon than either of the preceding, was the importance of ſupporting the poſt at Red-bank, upon which that of Fort-Mifflin in a great meaſure depended, as through it we ſent in ſupplies of men, proviſion, and ammunition. The enemy, ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of this, endeavored to diſlodge us from Red-bank on the twenty-ſecond of laſt month; which, as Congreſs have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, coſt them four hundred men.</p>
                  <p>Now, had our army been on the weſt ſide of Schuylkill, they
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:031423_0467_0FEC5D97A3C90A90"/>
might, without any danger of an attack upon their lines, have thrown over of conſiderable a force into Jerſey, that they might have overpowered the garriſon, and, by making themſelves maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of it, have reduced Fort-Mifflin by famine or want of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munition. Thus we ſhould in all probability have loſt both poſts by one ſtroke.—They might alſo, by taking poſſeſſion of the fords upon Schuylkill, have rendered the junction of our northern reinforcements with us a very difficult, if not an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable matter: and, ſhould any accident have happened to them, we ſhould have ſtood a very poor chance of looking ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Howe in the face through the winter with an inferior ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. We ſhould finally have thrown the army into ſuch a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, that we muſt inevitable have drawn on a general en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gagement before our reinforcements arrived; which, conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our diſparity of numbers, would probably have ended with the moſt diſagreeable conſequences.</p>
                  <p>It was therefore determined a few days ago to wait the arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of the reinforcement from the northward before any altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion could ſafely be made in the diſpoſition of the army: and I was not without hopes that the fort would have held out till that time.—That we might then have moved without endan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gering the ſtores, I had-given orders for the removal of them, from the places before mentioned, to Lebanon and other places in Lancaſter county, which is at any rate more ſafe and conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient than where they were.</p>
                  <p>As the keeping poſſeſſion of Red-bank, and thereby ſtill preventing the enemy from weighing the chevaux-de-friſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the froſt obliges their ſhips to quit the river, has become a matter of the greateſt importance, I have determined to ſend down general St. Clair, general Knox, and baron Kalb, to take a view of the ground, and to endeavor to form a judgment of the moſt probable means of ſecuring it. They will at the ſame time ſee how far it is poſſible for our fleet to keep their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſince the loſs of Fort-Mifflin, and alſo make the proper in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry into the conduct of the captains of the gallies, mentioned in the former part of this letter.</p>
                  <p>I am informed that it is matter of amazement, and that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections have been thrown out againſt this army, for not being more active and enterpriſing than, in the opinion of ſome, they ought to have been. If the charge is juſt, the beſt way to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for it, will be to refer you to the returns of our ſtrength, and thoſe which I can produce of the enemy, and to the incloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed abſtract of the clothing now actually wanting for the army: and then I think the wonder will be, how they keep the field
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:031423_0468_0FEC5EAE616B5FC8"/>
at all in tents at this ſeaſon of the year.—What ſtock the clo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thier-general has to ſupply this demand, or what are his proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects, he himſelf will inform you, as I have directed him to go to York-town to lay theſe matters before Congreſs. There are, beſides, moſt of thoſe in the hoſpitals more bare than thoſe in the field:—many remain there for want of clothes only.</p>
                  <p>Several general officers, unable to procure clothing in the common line, have employed agents to purchaſe up what could be found in different parts of the country. General Wayne, among others, has employed Mr. Zantzinger of Lancaſter, who has purchaſed to the amount of four thouſand five hundred pounds, for which he deſires a draught upon the treaſury-board.—Incloſed you have a copy of his letter.—I am not clear whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther this application ſhould properly be made to the treaſury, or the clothier-general, who ſhould charge the money to the regiments for whom the clothes are, as ſo much advanced to them. If the latter ſhould appear the moſt proper mode, I will order it to be done.</p>
                  <p>I am anxiouſly waiting the arrival of the troops from the northward, who ought, from the time they have had my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, to have been here before this. Colonel Hamilton, one of my aides, is up the North-river, doing all he can to puſh them forward: but he writes me word that he finds many un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>accountable delays thrown in his way. However I am in hopes that many days will not elapſe before a brigade or two, at leaſt, arrive.—The want of theſe troops has embarraſſed all my mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures exceedingly.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE been duly honored with your favors of the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth and nineteenth inſtant with their incloſures.—I am well aſſured Congreſs have not been inattentive to the neceſſities of the army: and that the deficiency in our ſupplies, particularly in the article of clothing, has ariſen from the difficulty of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting, on account of the numerous fleet that line our coaſt. However I am perſuaded that conſiderable relief might be drawn from the different ſtates, were they to exert themſelves
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:031423_0469_0FEC5D9B8F704928"/>
properly. This I hope will be the caſe as ſoon as they receive the preſſing recommendations of Congreſs upon the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>It has been the unvaried cuſtom of the enemy, from the commencement of the preſent conteſt, to try every artifice and device to delude the people. The meſſage through John Brown was calculated for this end. I am ſurpriſed Mr Willing ſhould ſuffer himſelf to be impoſed on by ſuch flimſy meaſures. He knows that there is a plain obvious way for general and lord Howe to communicate any propoſals they wiſh to make, to Congreſs, without the intervention of a ſecond and third hand. But this would not ſuit their views.—I am ſorry that Mr. Brown ſhould be the bearer of the meſſage; as, from the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter I have had of him, he is a worthy, well-diſpoſed man. It has been frequently mentioned that he had intereſted him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf much in behalf of our priſoners, and had afforded them e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very relief and comfort his circumſtances would allow him to give.</p>
                  <p>I have been endeavoring to effect an exchange of priſoners, from principles of juſtice, and from motives of humanity: but at preſent I have no proſpect of it. Yet general Howe has aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured our officers it was his wiſh, and, if it could not be done, that he ſhould readily agree to their releaſe on parole.—The incloſed copies of my letters and his anſwer will ſhew Congreſs what has paſſed between us upon that ſubject; and at the ſame time, that I had remonſtrated againſt the ſevere and cruel treatment of the priſoners, and propoſed the plan of ſending in a ſuitable perſon to inquire into the facts, before the receipt of their reſolution. Their ſufferings, I am perſuaded, have been great, and ſhocking to humanity. I have called upon general Howe for redreſs, and an explicit anſwer to my letter of the fourteenth. If I do not receive one by to-morrow night, with the moſt poſitive and ſatisfactory aſſurances that a proper con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct ſhall be obſerved towards them in future, we muſt retali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, however much we wiſh to avoid ſeverity, and meaſures that bear the ſmalleſt appearance of rigor or inhumanity.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed you will receive a liſt of ſundry officers who have been caſhiered ſince the action of the fourth ultimo.—I flatter myſelf that theſe examples will involves many favorable and beneficial conſequences.—Beſides theſe, there were many more brought to trial, who were acquitted; among them, general Maxwell, and general Wayne,—the former for charges againſt him while he commanded the light troops,—the latter for charges againſt his conduct in the attack made on his diviſion, in the night of the twentieth of September. The reſult of the

court of inquiry againſt general Wayne not entirely exempting him from cenſure in his own opinion, he requeſted a court-mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial; and, upon a full and minute inveſtigation of the charges againſt him, he was honorably acquitted, and in terms of high reſpect.</p>
                  <p>I am ſorry to inform Congreſs that the enemy are now in poſſeſſion of all the water defences.—Fort-Mifflin and that at Red-bank mutually depended on each other for ſupport; and the reduction of the former made the tenure of the latter ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely precarious, if not impracticable. After the loſs of Fort-Mifflin, it was found Red-bank could derive no advantages from the gallies and armed veſſels—(they could not maintain their ſtation)—and, in caſe of inveſtiture, the garriſon could have no ſupplies, no retreat, nor any hope of relief, but ſuch as might ariſe from a ſuperior force acting without on the rear of the enemy, and diſlodging them. Under theſe circumſtances, the garriſon was obliged to evacuate it on the night of the twentieth inſtant, on the approach of lord Cornwallis who had croſſed the river from Cheſter with a detachment. ſuppoſed to be about two thouſand men, and formed a junction with the troops lately arrived from New-York, and thoſe that had been landed before at Billingſport.</p>
                  <p>From general Varnum's account, I have reaſon to hope that we ſaved moſt of the ſtores, except a few heavy cannon: how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I cannot be particular in this inſtance.—I am alſo to add, from the intelligence I have received, that moſt if not all the armed veſſels have been burned by our own people, except the gallies, one brig, and two ſloops, which are ſaid to have run by the city.—How far this might be founded in neceſſity, I am not able to determine; but I ſuppoſe it was done under that idea, and an apprehenſion of their falling into the enemy's hands if they attempted to paſs up the river.</p>
                  <p>Upon the firſt information I had of lord Cornwallis's move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, I detached general Huntington's brigade to join general Varnum, and, as ſoon as poſſible, general, Greene with his divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; hoping that theſe,—with Glover's brigade which was on the march through Jerſey, and which I directed to file off to the left for the ſame purpoſe,—and with ſuch militia as could be collected,—would be able to defeat the enemy's deſign, and to preſerve the fort. But they were ſo rapid in their advances, that our troops could not form a juction and arrive in time to ſuccour the garriſon; which obliged them to withdraw.</p>
                  <p>General Greene is ſtill in Jerſey; and when Glover's bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gade joins him, if an attack can be made on lord Cornwallis
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:031423_0471_0FEC5EBAC115E888"/>
with a proſpect of ſucceſs, I am perſuaded it will be done. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a hundred and ſeventy of Morgan's corps are alſo gone to reinforce him.</p>
                  <p>Generals Poor and Patterſon with their brigades, and colonel Bailey with Learned's, are now in camp. The laſt arrived on friday evening, the other two in the courſe of yeſterday. I have not yet obtained returns of their ſtrength; but, from the accounts of the officers, they will amount in the whole to twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-three or twenty-four hundred rank and file. But I find ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them are very deficient in the articles of ſhoes, ſtockings, breeches, and blankets.—Beſides theſe, about three hundred and fifty men,—detachments from Lee's, Jackſon's, and Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley's regiments,—have joined me.</p>
                  <p>Yeſterday evening the enemy burned ſeveral houſes in the neighborhood of Philadelphia, and they have committed the moſt wanton ſpoil in many others.</p>

                  <p>I WAS yeſterday morning honored with your favors of the twenty-ſecond inſtant.—I wiſh the meaſures Congreſs have adopted may effectually ſuppreſs the diſturbances in the weſtern department. Should they prove ſucceſsful and the ſavages and wicked deluded inhabitants receive a ſevere check, it is proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they will not be induced again to take part againſt us, or at leaſt for ſome conſiderable time. Colonel Crawford ſet out yeſterday evening, and will be with Congreſs I expect, in the courſe of two or three days to take their commands.</p>
                  <p>I was much obliged by the foreign intelligence you were pleaſed to tranſmit me: it is agreeable and intereſting: and I heartily wiſh there may be an early declaration of hoſtilities between France and Britain. From theſe advices, things ſeem to be getting into a proper train for it: and it is not eaſily to be conceived that it can be much longer delayed. However our expectations have not been anſwered in this inſtance, and they may yet be held in ſuſpenſe. The political reaſons, that lead to delay on the part of France, I do not perfectly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand. As to Britain, her honor is loſt in the conteſt with us, and the moſt indignant inſults will ſcarcely be able to draw her attention from her preſent purſuits.—The account of Mr. Lee having effected the purpoſes of his embaſſy at the court of Berlin is of great importance, if it be true. In ſuch caſe,
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:031423_0472_0FEC5DA28A67CD98"/>
adminiſtration, however deſirous they may be, will probably be diſappointed in their ſchemes of further mercenary aides againſt us.</p>
                  <p>I muſt take the liberty to requeſt the deciſion of Congreſs on the caſe of the nine firſt-raiſed Virginia regiments as early as circumſtances will permit. If the plan propoſed for re-en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſting them is judged expedient, one capital inducement to that end, ſuggeſted by the officers, will ceaſe if it is longer delayed. It is a matter of conſiderable importance, and of which I wiſh to be ſatisfied as ſoon as poſſible.—I ſhould alſo be happy in their determination reſpecting the marquis De la Fayette. He is more and more ſolicitous to be in actual ſervice, and is preſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in his applications for a command.—I ventured before to ſubmit my ſentiments upon the meaſure; and I ſtill fear a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſal will not only induce him to return in diſguſt, but may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve ſome unfavorable conſequences.—There are now ſome vacant diviſions in the army, to one of which he may be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, if it ſhould be the pleaſure of Congreſs. I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced he poſſeſſes a large ſhare of that military ardor which generally characteriſes the nobility of his country. He went to Jerſey with general Greene, and I find he has not been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>active there. This you will perceive by the following extract from a letter juſt received from general Greene.</p>
                  <p>"The marquis, with about four hundred militia and the rifle corps, attacked the enemy's piquet laſt evening, killed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout twenty, wounded many more, and took about twenty pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners. The marquis is charmed with the ſpirited behavior of the militia and rifle corps:—they drove the enemy about half a mile, and kept the ground until dark. The enemy's piquet conſiſted of about three hundred, and were reinforced during the ſkirmiſh.—The marquis is determined to be in the way of danger."</p>
                  <p>* * * I muſt requeſt you to tranſmit me a number of bank commiſſions as ſoon as you have an opportunity to do it. There are ſeveral vacancies yet to fill; and the officers entitled to them are anxious to be appointed. The commiſſions I want ſhould be under your ſignature, and not Mr. Hancock's. I mention this, leſt you ſhould ſend any of the latter that might remain. Thoſe ſigned by you will be competent to all caſes: thoſe by Mr Hancock, only to ſuch as happened during his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidency; and of theſe I have now ſome.</p>

when I was giving the commiſſary of priſoners inſtructions forthwith to confine a number of the officers in our hands, and to put the privates under very different reſtrictions from thoſe they have been uſed to.—I am in hopes the treatment of ours will be much better in future. Mr. Boudinot will immediately take meaſures for releaſing the officers on parole, that we may relieve an equal number of ours.

                  <p>ON ſaturday I had the honor to receive your favor of the twenty-ſixth ultimo with its incloſures.—The reſolve of the twenty-fifth I have buliſhed in orders, agreeable to direction, and ſhall be happy if Congreſs can fall upon meaſures to render the ſituation of the officers and ſoldiery more eligible than what it now is. At preſent it is truly diſtreſſing: and, unleſs ſome means can be deviſed to ſupport them more comfortably, we ſhall have to apprehend the moſt alarming conſequences. The officers, or at leaſt a large proportion of them, as well as the men, are in a moſt diſagreeable condition as to clothing, and without any certain proſpect of relief: and, what is ſtill more painful,—if perchance they have an opportunity of purchaſing (which is ſeldom the caſe), they have the mortification to find themſelves totally incompetent to it, from the depreciation of our money, and the exorbitant prices demanded for all articles in this way.—This is the ſource of great uneaſineſs, of indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to the ſervice, and of repeated (I may ſay, daily) applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to leave it, and theſe too by as good officers as are in the American line.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect to promotions for merit and intrepidity, I would beg leave to obſerve, that, though theſe are proper conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to found them upon, yet they ſhould be made with the greateſt caution and attention, and only in caſes of the moſt e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent and diſtinguiſhed ſervices. Every promotion or riſe out of common courſe cannot fail to excite uneaſineſs in a great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or leſſer degree: and nothing will reconcile them to the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:031423_0474_0FEC5EBE696D50F0"/>
my at large, and particularly the officers more immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by them,—but where the cauſes are known and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged. This I mention from my wiſhes to promote the public in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt, from my knowledge that harmony is eſſential to this end, and from no other motive whatever.</p>
                  <p>Before the receipt of your favor, I do not recollect to have heard of John Simper's caſe. His brother has not been with me. As ſoon as he arrives, I ſhall give directions for him to be releaſed from his preſent confinement, and to be forwarded to Cecil county.</p>
                  <p>I have nothing material to inform Congreſs of.—Lord Corn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wallis and the detachment under his command (mentioned in my laſt) returned from Jerſey on thurſday.—We had reaſon to expect an attack ſince, from our advices from the city, but have been diſappointed.—General Greene has alſo joined me with all the troops that were with him, except Huntington's brigade, which will be in to-day.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE the honor to inform you, that, in the courſe of laſt week, from a variety of intelligence, I had reaſon to expect that general Howe was preparing to give us a general action. Accordingly, on thurſday night he moved from the city with all his force, except a very inconſiderable part left in his lines and redoubts,—and appeared the next morning on Cheſnut-hill, in front of, and about three miles diſtant from, our right wing. As ſoon as their poſition was diſcovered, the Pennſylvania mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia were ordered from our right, to ſkirmiſh with their light advanced parties; and I am ſorry to mention that brigadier-general Irvine who led them on had the misfortune to be wounded and to be made priſoner.—Nothing more occurred on that day.</p>
                  <p>On friday night, the enemy changed their ground, and moved to our left, within a mile of our line, where they remained qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et and advantageouſly poſted the whole of the next day. On ſunday they inclined ſtill further to our left; and, from every appearance, there was reaſon to apprehend they were deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined on an action.—In this movement, their advanced and flanking parties were warmly attacked by colonel Morgan and his corps, and alſo by the Maryland militia under colonel Giſt. Their loſs I cannot aſcertain: but I am informed it was conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable,
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:031423_0475_0FEC5EC01A69A090"/>
having regard to the number of the corps who engaged them.—About ſun-ſet after various marches and counter-march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, they halted; and I ſtill ſuppoſed, from their diſpoſition and preceding manoeuvres, that they would attack us in the night or early the next morning: but in this I was miſtaken.</p>
                  <p>On monday afternoon they began to move again, and, inſtead of advancing, filed off from their right: and the firſt certain ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count that I could obtain of their intentions was that they were in full march towards Philadelphia by two or three routes.—I immediate detached light parties after them to fall upon their rear: but they were not able to come up with them.</p>
                  <p>The enemy's loſs, as I have obſerved, I cannot aſcertain. One account from the city is that five hundred wounded had been ſent in; another is that eighty-two waggons had gone in with men in this ſituation. Theſe, I fear, are both exaggerated, and not to be depended upon.—We loſt twenty-ſeven men in Morgan's corps, killed and wounded, beſides major Morris, a brave and gallant officer, who is among the latter. Of the Maryland militia there were alſo ſixteen or ſeventeen wounded. I have not received further returns yet.</p>
                  <p>I ſincerely wiſh that they had made an attack, as the iſſue, in all probability,—from the diſpoſition of our troops, and the ſtrong ſituation of our camp,—would have been fortunate and happy. At the ſame time I muſt add, that reaſon, prudence, and every principle of policy, forbad us quitting our poſt to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack them. Nothing but ſucceſs would have juſtified the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: and this could not be expected from their poſition.</p>
                  <p>The conſtant attention and watching I was obliged to give the enemy's movements would not allow me to write before: and this I believe was the leſs material, as I have reaſon to think your committee who were in camp moſt of the time, and who are now here, tranſmitted an account of ſuch occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences as they deemed important in any degree. The firſt cauſe too, ſir, and my engagements with the committee previ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the coming out of the enemy, will, I truſt, ſufficiently apologiſe for my not acknowledging before the honor of your favors of the thirtieth ultimo and the firſt inſtant, which came to hand in due order and time.</p>

The letter you allude to, from the committee of Congreſs and board of war, came to hand on ſaturday morning: but it does not mention the regulations adopted for removing the difficulties and failures in the commiſſary line. I truſt they will be vigorous, or the army cannot exiſt. It will never anſwer, to procure ſupplies of clothing or proviſion by coereive meaſures:—the ſmall ſei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zures made of the former a few days a ago in conſequence of the moſt preſſing and abſolute neceſſity,—when that, or to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, was the alternative,—excited the greateſt alarm and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſineſs even among our beſt and warmeſt friends. Such pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedures may give a momentary relief; but, if repeated, will prove of the moſt pernicious conſequence. Beſides ſpreading diſaffection, jealouſy, and fear in the people, they never fail, even in the moſt veteran troops under the moſt rigid and exact diſcipline, to raiſe in the ſoldiery a diſpoſition of licentiouſneſs, to plunder and robbery,—difficult to ſuppreſs afterwards, and which has proved not only ruinous to the inhabitants, but, in many inſtances, to armies themſelves.—I regret the occaſion that compelled us to the meaſure the other day; and ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider

                  <p>The proceedings of Congreſs for the detention of general Burgoyne and army, or rather ſuſpending their embarkation, till the convention of Saratoga is explicitly ratified and noti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the court of Britain, ſhall remain ſecret here till they are duly announced by Congreſs.—This procedure, when known to the general, will chagrin him much: for I learn by a letter from general Heath, that the refuſal to let his troops embark at Rhode-Iſland or in the Sound had given him ſome uneaſineſs.—I have nothing of importance to communicate; and have only to add that I have the honor to be, with great reſpect, &amp;c.</p>

                     <p>P. S. The great diverſity of opinions prevailing, as to the operation which the reſolves of the thirtieth ultimo and firſt inſtant ſhould have, which gave a month's extra pay, makes it neceſſary for me to requeſt Congreſs to deſcribe with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty and preciſion the perſons who they intended ſhould be
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:031423_0478_0FEC5ECC5880FEB8"/>
the particular objects of their bonevolence. Without this, I am certain I ſhall not be able to execute the reſolves according to their intention, and in a manner that will be agreeable to the army.</p>
                     <p>If ſuch officers and men as were in camp when the reſolves were paſſed, and who continue the whole winter, are the only objects to be benefited, it is urged that many who have diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charged their duty with fidelity,—who have experienced a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vere campaign to that time or till a few days before,—who may be now out of camp, and yet be here in the courſe of the winter,—will be excluded. For example, all officers and men on furlough, though they ſhould have been long from their homes before,—perhaps much longer in many inſtances, than many who remain,—and whoſe private neceſſities oblige them to be abſent,—thoſe who have fallen ſick from their ſervices, and who are in hoſpitals or in the country,—detachments on command,—theſe would be excluded. Such diſcriminations, I believe, will give great diſguſt and uneaſineſs.—It is diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, in caſes of this nature, to draw a proper line of diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and impoſſible to do it in ſuch a way as to give ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>I do not mean to enlarge upon the ſubject: my only wiſh is to have it preciſely aſcertained, who are to be included and paid, and who are not, under the reſolves, that I may not on the one hand act contrary to the public intention, and on the other give cauſe of complaint, and perhaps do wrong to indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals.</p>
                     <p>Knowing the difficulty of drawing a proper line, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt and murmurings that ever attend diſcriminations,—were I to adviſe upon the ſubject, only ſuch officers and men ſhould be excluded (ſince extra pay has been determined on) as are ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent from camp without regular authority, or ſuch as may abuſe indulgencies regularly obtained.</p>
                     <p>It has been obſerved by ſome, and perhaps with propriety, that there are officers and men now in camp, or who may be ſhortly in, who have no ſuperior claim to merit,—whoſe affairs are not ſo preſſing, or who have already had indulgencies,—or who, from their being nearer their friends and connections, have had opportunities of ſeeing them frequently, of ordering their concerns, and viſiting their homes once, twice, or perhaps oftener in the campaign.—whilſt they who were more remote were precluded from any of theſe advantages, and were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly on duty. Theſe conſiderations will have their weight in the ſcale of diſguſt with the parties intereſted.—For my part,
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:031423_0479_0FEC5ECE5CA23728"/>
though the reſolves were founded in principles of generoſity,—were intended to reward merit, and promote the ſervice,—from the difficulties attending the execution, I wiſh they had never been made, eſpecially as I believe officers and men would in a little time have become tolerably well reconciled to their quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</p>

                  <p>AS I do not recollect with preciſion whether any, or what reſolutions have been made by Congreſs reſpecting cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by the army or detachments of it, and not having all their proceedings with me, with which I have been honored from time to time to aſſiſt my enquiries upon the ſubject,—I muſt take the liberty to requeſt that they will determine, and favor me with their deciſions upon, the following points:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. What articles captured are to be conſidered as public pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whether articles captured by parties or detachments, not determined public property, are to be diſtributed or ſold for the benefit of the army at large, or are to be conſidered as the ſole and excluſive right of the captors?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. If, in general inſtances, ſuch articles as are taken, and which are not conſidered public property, are determined to be the ſole and excluſive right of the captors,—are ſtationary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments, who, from their ſituation, have much more than a common chance of making prizes, to be conſidered upon the ſame footing?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. If there is to be a diſtinction between ſtationary and other detachments,—and the former are denied an excluſive right to the captures they make,—what proportion of the articles are they to have?</p>
                  <p>I have been induced to ſtate the above queſtions on account of ſome difficulties that have ariſen reſpecting the prize taken by the detachment at Wilmington under general Smallwood, that the ſame may be determined, and certain principles eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, to govern in like and future caſes.—In the inſtance of this prize, as the baggage taken (from general Smallwood's and the officers' repreſentation) will be but inconſiderable when divided among themſelves, I have conſented that they ſhall have it at a juſt appraiſement and diſtribution, and have directed him to have the whole, and the value, properly inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toried,
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:031423_0480_0FEC5ED765F94C58"/>
that ſuch order may be made reſpecting the latter, as the deciſions of Congreſs may juſtify and point out. I have alſo directed the ſale of the brig, as I underſtand ſome offers have been made for her, and as her ſituation may be conſidered hazardous and precarious.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the brig taken at Wilmington, a veſſel has ſtranded at Reedy-Iſland with goods on board. It is ſaid a quantity of rum, ſome bales of cloth, a number of hats, and ſome other ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles (all wanted by the army), have been taken out of her by the militia, particularly thoſe of Kent county. Theſe general Smallwood is endeavoring to find, that they may be of public benefit.</p>

                  <p>THIS will be delivered to you by the chevalier De Mau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duit du Pleſſis, who was among the firſt French officers that joined the army of the United States. The gallant conduct of this young gentlemen at Brandiwine, Germantown, and his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinguiſhed ſervices at Fort-Mercer where he united the offices of engineer and commandant of artillery, entitle him to the particular notice of Congreſs.—He made ſeveral judicious al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terations in the works at Red-bank, ſhewed great good conduct during the action in which the Heſſians were repulſed, and was ſpoken of, in conſequence, in terms of the higheſt applauſe, by the commanding officer of the poſt.—After the evacuation was determined upon, he became the means of ſaving ſome valuable artillery and ſtores, and cheerfully undertook, as volunteer, the hazardous operation of blowing up the magazine, &amp;c. without the apparatus uſually provided upon ſuch occaſions.—I muſt further add in monſieur Du Pleſſis' favor, that he poſſeſſes a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of modeſty not always found in men who have performed brilliant actions. It is with pleaſure therefore that I recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to Congreſs to grant him a brevet of lieutenant-colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel,—a reward due to his merit, and which will not have the inconvenience of occaſioning any diſſatisfaction in the corps to which he belongs.</p>

The demands were immenſe, moſt of the eaſtern troops having had four or five months' pay due to them, and ſome, more. The army now in general has three months' pay in arrear, excluſive of the month's extra pay; and, beſides this, the quarter-maſter is preſſing for large draughts for the purpoſes of his department, though he has received a proportion of the money which came with Mr. Palfrey.</p>

                  <p>
                     <hi>February</hi> 12.—Since writing the above I have received ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther letter from general Howe, of the fifth inſtant, a copy of which, and of my anſwer, you have alſo incloſed. By theſe you will perceive that he has propoſed a general exchange of priſoners, and that I have acceded to it.—I have written to Mr. Boudinot, commiſſary in this line, requiring his return to camp; and ſhall give him directions to purſue the moſt ſpeedy meaſures for accompliſhing this buſineſs, ſo intereſting to the unhappy officers and men in general Howe's hands, and to the cauſe of humanity.—There are ſome other matters, as you will diſcover, which I could not enter upon.</p>
                  <p>The ſituation of the affairs of the army has not till lately made it convenient to go into the inquiry directed by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve of the twenty-eighth of November, of the loſſes of the Forts Montgomery and Clinton in the ſtate of New-York, and
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:031423_0483_0FEC5EDEA38FD9F0"/>
of Fort-Mifflin on Delaware. With reſpect to the two former, it happens that almoſt all the principal officers acting in that quarter were in ſome way or other ſo far concerned in the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fair, as to make them improper for proſecuting the inquiry; I therefore propoſe to ſend officers from this army. If his health will permit, I ſhould wiſh general M'Dougall to preſide. His thorough knowledge of thoſe poſts and all their connections qualifies him in a peculiar manner for the purpoſe.—I have written to him on the ſubject.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to Fort-Mifflin, the inquiry involves very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive conſiderations, and more or leſs, affects almoſt all the general officers in this army, whoſe advice and concurrence in the meaſures taken make them in ſome degree parties. The mode, in my opinion, moſt unexceptionable, to be purſued, is for Congreſs to authoriſe a committee of their own body, or to delegate any other perſons they may chuſe to entruſt, not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with the operations of this army, to go into the buſineſs.</p>

                  <p>I AM now to acknowledge the honor of your ſeveral favors of the eightenth, nineteenth, and twenty-firſt inſtant, which, with their reſpective incloſures, have been duly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived.</p>
                  <p>In compliance with the reſolution of Congreſs of the fifth inſtant, tranſmitted in your letter of the ſeventh, I was about to take meaſures for appointing a court-martial and bringing on the trials which they direct. But on recurring to the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers you were pleaſed to ſend me, I do not find that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee have made any particular charges againſt the officers who are to be the objects of trial. It was probably the inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Congreſs that theſe charges ſhould be laid by me. But as I might err in doing it, and not fully correſpond with their
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:031423_0484_0FEC47AF991AC200"/>
views in the matter,—eſpecially as it would require conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble time and thought to make myſelf ſufficiently acquainted with it from the papers collected,—I ſhould think it would be moſt adviſable for Congreſs to ſtate explicitly the charges they wiſh to have exhibited againſt the officers reſpectively; and then the buſineſs may be proceeded on with propriety.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the above reaſons which operate generally againſt my exhibiting the charges,—in the particular inſtance of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Schuyler, it is impoſſible for me to do it, as I do not know what inſtructions he had received from Congreſs from time to time as to the objects of his command, nor preciſely what theſe were. Theſe appear to me neceſſary to be known, and eſſential to carry on a proſecution againſt him.</p>
                  <p>When Congreſs ſhall have arranged theſe points, and are pleaſed to honor me with them, I will purſue the ſpeedieſt mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures to bring on the trials.—The ſooner this can be done, the better, as ſome of the parties are extremely anxious, and ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly importune it.</p>
                  <p>Baron Steuben has arrived at camp. He appears to be much of a gentleman, and, as far as I have had an opportunity of judging, a man of military knowledge, and acquainted with the world.</p>
                  <p>The incloſed extract of a letter from general Putnam will ſhew how great the diſtreſſes are in that quarter for want of money. He has deſcribed their neceſſities ſo fully, that it is unneceſſary for me to add upon the ſubject: I ſhall only obſerve that his account is more than juſtified by many other letters, and that I am perſuaded the earlieſt poſſible ſupply will be for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded, that the very important and intereſting works carrying on there may not be the leaſt retarded.</p>
                  <p>I am under ſome embarraſſments reſpecting the thirteenth Virginia regiment. It was raiſed on the weſt ſide of the Alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gany and towards Pittſburg, with aſſurances from the officers, it is ſaid, that the men ſhould not be drawn from that quarter. This circumſtance, added to the diſturbances by the Indians, and the expoſed ſituation of their families, has been the cauſe of great deſertions, and is at preſent the ſource of much uneaſineſs, and the more ſo, as part of the regiment was never marched from thence.—I think the whole ſhould be united either here or there, and wiſh Congreſs to direct me upon the ſubject.—At the ſame time that their caſe, if truly repreſented, ſeems to be hard, and to merit the indulgence they claim, I would ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve that the twelfth regiment from the weſtern parts of the ſame ſtate, and the eighth and twelfth Pennſylvania from the
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:031423_0485_0FEC5DACAF97E238"/>
frontier counties of this, have ſimilar pretenſions, and might become uneaſy, and apply for a like indulgence.</p>
                  <p>Agreeable to the directions of Congreſs, I ſhall ſend a major-general to Rhode-Iſland though the number of officers here of this rank, from one cauſe and another, is greatly reduced, and more ſo than it ought to be in point of policy.</p>
                  <p>Our loſs of matroſſes, the laſt campaign, in killed and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was conſiderable; and it has not been a little increaſed this winter by deſertions from colonel Proctor's corps. From theſe circumſtances, we are very weak in this line; and I requeſt that Congreſs will be pleaſed to order colonel Harriſon's regiment of artillery to march from Virginia as early as the roads will admit, and join this army.</p>

                  <p>I TAKE the liberty of tranſmitting you copies of three, letters from general Howe, of the fourteenth and twenty-firſt ultimo, and of the ſecond inſtant, with their incloſures. The unhappy violation of the flag of truce has laid us under no ſmall embarraſſments, and has afforded the enemy good grounds for complaint and triumph at the ſame time. This however is the natural conſequence, and muſt ever be the caſe, where different powers counteract each other in matters of the moſt delicate importance. There are ſome circumſtances attending this affair, which it may poſſibly be in the power of Congreſs to throw light upon.—If they can, I ſhall be obliged by their aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>March</hi> 8.—In conſequence of the letters which have lately paſſed between general Howe and myſelf,—particularly thoſe of the fifth and tenth ultimo, copies of which I had the honor to tranſmit you in mine of the eighth, continued to the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth,—I was about to ſend commiſſioners to meet thoſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by general Howe for adjuſting the diſputed points be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us, carry into execution an exchange of priſoners, and improving the old cartel, as far as it might be practicable, for their better accommodation in future. This meeting was to be on the tenth inſtant: but, yeſterday morning, Dunlap's paper of the fourth being put into my hands, I found that a reſolution had been made the twenty-ſixth of February, calling for all ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts againſt priſoners in our hands, and declaring that no ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change ſhould take place, till the balance due thereon to the
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:031423_0486_0FEC5EE951639960"/>
United States is diſcharged. Some of the ſtates are not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to exhibit their claims till the firſt of June.—The time that would be taken to adjuſt them, and make a delivery of the priſoners, would more than exhauſt all the enſuing ſummer.</p>
                  <p>This reſolution I cannot conſider as an intended infraction of my engagements with general Howe: yet its operation is dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metrically oppoſite both to the ſpirit and letter of the propoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made on my part, and acceded to on his. I ſuppoſed my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf fully authoriſed "by the inſtructions and intentions" of Congreſs to act as I did: and I now conceive that the public as well as my own perſonal honor and faith are pledged for the performance.</p>
                  <p>By the direction of Congreſs, I in the firſt inſtance ſtipulated with general Howe an exchange of priſoners,—officer for offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cer, of equal rank,—ſoldier for ſoldier,—and citizen for citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen. This agreement they have ever approved, and repeatedly declared their willingneſs to carry into execution.—Their reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of the twenty-fourth of March laſt empowered me (on condition of general Lee being declared exchangeable) not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly "<hi>to proceed</hi>" to the exchange of priſoners according to the principles and regulations of the cartel before agreed on, but alſo to enter into ſuch further principles and regulations as ſhould appear to me moſt proper and advantageous. A ſubſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent reſolution of the ſixth of June holds forth the ſame lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, ſanctions my conduct and reaſonings in the negociations about that time on the ſubject, and directs an adherence to them.—No event has occurred ſince that period, by which I could conclude there was any alteration in the views of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs:—ſo far from it, that all my late letters breathing the ſame ſpirit with the former, and pointedly ſignifying my wiſh to bring about a general exchange,—if not with an expreſs,—at leaſt met with a tacit approbation.—General Howe at length by profeſſion, if not in reality, is willing to perform the agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the conditions required by me, and confirmed by them.</p>
                  <p>It may be ſaid, that, with whatever powers I was originally veſted to negotiate an exchange, the reſolution of the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of December laſt was an abridgment of them, ſo far as to annex a new condition,—the ſettlement and payment of accounts previous to its taking place.—I had no conception of this being the caſe in the preſent inſtance, however the letter may warrant the conſtruction. Beſides the common principle of preventing the inconveniencies neceſſarily reſulting from al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the enemy to make their payments in paper currency, I had reaſon to imagine that general Burgoyne's army was
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:031423_0487_0FEC5EEB0A208780"/>
more particularly the object of the concluding clauſe. This interpretation I the more readily adopted; for, excluſive of the affairs of that army, I verily believed, that, from the confuſed defective ſtate of our accounts relating to priſoners, there would be a conſiderable balance in favor of Mr. Howe. Nor was the ſituation of our accounts the only reaſon for this belief:—the priſoners in our hands, eſpecially thoſe weſtward of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware, as I am informed, have been in a great meaſure ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by their own labor, and at the expenſe of the enemy, who have had agents conſtantly among us.—If this is the caſe, the reaſon of the reſolve not applying, the effect ought not of courſe.</p>
                  <p>But perhaps it may be thought contrary to our intereſt to go into an exchange, as the enemy would derive more immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate advantage from it then we ſhould.—This I ſhall not deny: but it appeared to me, that, on principles of genuine, extenſive policy, independent of the conſiderations of compaſſion and juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, we were under an obligation not to elude it. I have the beſt evidence that an event of this kind is the general wiſh of the country:—I know it to be the wiſh of the army; and no one can doubt that it is the ardent wiſh of the unhappy ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers themſelves. We need only conſult the tide of humanity, and the ſympathies natural to thoſe connected by the cements of blood, intereſt, and a common dread of evil, to be convinced that the prevailing current of ſentiment demands an exchange. If the country, the army, and even the priſoners themſelves, had a preciſe idea of our circumſtances, and could be fully ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the diſadvantages that might attend the giving our e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemy a conſiderable reinforcement without having an equiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent, they might perhaps be willing to make a ſacrifice of their feelings to the motives of policy. But they have not this knowledge, and cannot be entruſted with it; and their reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, of neceſſity, will be governed by what they feel.</p>
                  <p>Were an opinion once to be eſtabliſhed (and the enemy and their emiſſaries know very well how to inculcate it, if they are furniſhed with a plauſible pretext), that we deſignedly avoided an exchange, it would be a cauſe of diſſatisfaction and diſguſt to the country and to the army,—of reſentment and deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to our captive officers and ſoldiers:—to ſay nothing of the importance of not hazarding our national character but up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the moſt ſolid grounds, eſpecially in our embryo ſtate, from the influence it may have on our affairs abroad,—it may not be a little dangerous to beget in the minds of our own country<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:031423_0488_0FEC5EF27199B160"/>
a ſuſpicion that we do not pay the ſtricteſt obſervance to the maxims of honor and good faith.</p>
                  <p>It is prudent to uſe the greateſt caution not to ſhock the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of general juſtice and humanity, univerſal among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as well in a public as a private view. In a buſineſs on the ſide of which the paſſions are ſo much concerned as in the preſent, men would be readily diſpoſed to believe the worſt, and cheriſh the moſt unfavorable concluſions. Were the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters that, have paſſed between general Howe and myſelf from firſt to laſt, and the proceedings of Congreſs on the ſame ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, to be publiſhed with proper comments, it is much to be feared,—if the exchange ſhould be deferred till the terms of the laſt reſolve were fulfilled,—that it would be difficult to prevent our being generally accuſed with a breach of good faith. Perhaps it might be ſaid, that, while the enemy refuſed us juſtice, we fondly embraced the opportunity to be loud, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevering, inceſſant in our claims; but the moment they were willing to render it, we receded from ourſelves, and ſtarted new difficulties.—This, I ſay, might be the reaſoning of ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative minds; and they might conſider all our profeſſions as <hi>mere</hi> profeſſions; or, at beſt, that intereſt and policy were to be the only arbiters of their validity.</p>
                  <p>Imputations of this nature would have a tendency to unnerve our operations, by diminiſhing that reſpect and confidence which are eſſential to be placed in thoſe who are at the head of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs either in the civil or military line. This, added to the proſpect of hopeleſs captivity, would be a great diſcouragement to the ſervice. The ill conſequences of both would be immenſe, by increaſing the cauſes of diſcontent in the army, which are already too numerous, and many of which are in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure unavoidable,—by fortifying that unwillingneſs which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready appears too great, towards entering into the ſervice, and of courſe impeding the progreſs both of draughting and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruiting,—by dejecting the courage of the ſoldiery, from an apprehenſion of the horrors of captivity,—and finally by reduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe, whoſe lot it is to drink the bitter cup, to a deſpair which can only find relief by renouncing their attachments and engaging with their captors. Theſe effects have already been experienced in part from the obſtacles that have lain in the way of exchanges: but if theſe obſtacles were once to ſeem the reſult of ſyſtem, they would become ten-fold.—Nothing has operated more diſagreeably upon the minds of the militia than the fear of captivity, on the footing it has hitherto ſtood.—
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:031423_0489_0FEC5EF4B01324E8"/>
What would be their reaſonings, if it ſhould be thought to ſtand upon a worſe?</p>
                  <p>If a preſent temporary intereſt is to be a ruling principle, it is eaſy to prove that an exchange can never take place. The conſtitution of our army in reſpect to the term of ſervice for which our men engage, and the dependence we are obliged to place on the militia, muſt forever operate againſt us in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changes, and forbid an equality of advantages. Should it be ſaid that there are times when it might be more peculiarly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>equal and injurious, and that the preſent is ſuch on account of the weak condition of our army,—I anſwer that the delay ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſarily involved in the previous negociation on the ſubject, in delivering the priſoners from time to time in ſmall numbers and receiving others in their ſtead, and the mode of delivery at dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent places, will nearly bring the matter to the point we could wiſh, and give us leiſure to reinforce this army (if it is to be done at all), ſo as to obviate in a great meaſure the ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences apprehended.</p>
                  <p>But if the argument of intereſt on a partial ſcale be purſued as far as it will go, not only the general conſideration thrown out above, but ſpecial ones appoſite to every ſituation, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent themſelves, that we ought not to exchange:—now we ought not, becauſe our army is weak!—when the ſeaſon is more advanced, and it is time for the campaign to open, we ought not, becauſe our army may be ſtrong, and it will be our buſineſs to avail ourſelves of our own ſtrength and the enemy's weakneſs, to ſtrike ſome deciſive blow!—if they, by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of their ſhipping and impregnable works, ſhould be able to baffle our attempts till the period of reinforcements from Europe arrive, it will ſurely then not be our intereſt to add numbers and ſtrength to an enemy already ſufficiently nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous and ſtrong!—Thus, by a parity of reaſoning, the golden aera will never come, which is to relieve the miſeries of capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity. Our ſervice muſt become odious: thoſe who are out of it will endeavor to keep ſo; and thoſe who are in it will wiſh to get out of it: every priſoner the enemy makes will be his ſoldier rather than ſubmit to a rigorous and deſpairing confine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                  <p>If we do not ſeize the preſent propitious moment when the neceſſities of the enemy preſs them to reaſonable terms, to form and eſtabliſh a liberal cartel, it is not impoſſible, in the viciſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tudes and reverſes of war, that a time may come when we ſhould wiſh we had embraced it, and intereſt may ſtrongly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> enemy to decline it, except on the moſt unequal condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:031423_0490_0FEC5EF94828CE60"/>
True policy, as well as good faith, in my opinion, binds us to improve the occaſion.</p>
                  <p>There are however ſome ambiguities in general Howe's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, which require explanation, and ought to put us upon our guard.—I determined to make the affair of citizens,—<abbr>viz.</abbr> to procure an exemption from captivity for them, if poſſible,—or, if not, (ſince it cannot now be demanded as a matter of right) to fix their exchangeability upon the eaſieſt and moſt unequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal foundation.—an indiſpenſable preliminary to any further procedure; and at the ſame time to ſecure the exchange of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Lee and all other officers who have been the particular objects of exception.</p>
                  <p>The interview intended between general Howe's commiſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers and thoſe on our part on the tenth inſtant is now poſtponed. I cannot doubt that Congreſs, in preſervation of the public faith and my perſonal honor, will remove all impediments that now oppoſe themſelves to my engagements, and that they will authoriſe me, through commiſſioners appointed for the purpoſe, to negociate a more extenſive and competent cartel, upon ſuch principles as may appear advantageous and founded in neceſſity,—any reſolutions heretofore to the contrary notwithſtanding; and I muſt requeſt that they will favor me with their anſwer by the earlieſt opportunity.</p>
                  <p>The work, from its nature, will be difficult. Two parties are concerned, whoſe intereſts are more than oppoſite in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon view.—We ſhall endeavor to act for the beſt, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote the public ſervice as far as poſſible, though we may not be able to anſwer the expectations of all. But it ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membered, that, although general Howe's want of men affords a proſpect of favorable terms, yet he will not be diſpoſed to ſacrifice to it all conſiderations of general advantage in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract of ſuch a nature; and it is not even to be hoped that it can take place except on principles of mutual benefit.</p>
                  <p>I perſuade myſelf that the freedom I have taken in deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing my ſentiments ſo fully upon this occaſion will readily be excuſed, as it proceeds from a deſire to place the motives of my conduct in a juſt point of view, and from an opinion of du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty that led me to a free diſcuſſion of a ſubject, which conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in all its lights, will appear to comprehend conſequences of the firſt delicacy and magnitude.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE been this day favored with yours of the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſeventh of February, and of the ſecond, third, and fourth inſtant, which I ſhall anſwer in their order.</p>
                  <p>The removal of ſo valuable a train of field artillery from Albany to Farmington, as to a place of greater ſecurity, was certainly a meaſure highly proper; and you may be aſſured that every precaution ſhall be taken to eſcort them ſafely through Jerſey to this camp, when it is thought adviſable to bring them hither.</p>
                  <p>You miſtook the intent of mine of the eighteenth of Febru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary. I did not mean to give you the trouble of making a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the Britiſh officers who were exchanged after the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention. General Reideſel, as I informed you wrote to me to obtain liberty for him to make an exchange of ſome of his ſuite and other foreign officers, as that liberty had been allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Britiſh. I did not chuſe to give him any anſwer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til I had applied to you, that I might know whether you had any reaſon for making ſuch diſtinction: and as you miſappre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended me, I ſhall ſtill be obliged to defer anſwering him till I hear from you.—I think, conſidering the great number of of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficers of ours who are in captivity, it is our intereſt to exchange as many of their officers, priſoners under the convention, as we can.</p>
                  <p>Commiſſioners from me are to meet others from general Howe on the thirty-firſt of this month, to endeavor to ſettle a general exchange of priſoners.—Until we know the iſſue of the negociation, it will be hardly worth while to alter the ſituation of the priſoners in Lancaſter county.</p>
                  <p>On the twenty-ſeventh of February I had occaſion to write to Congreſs, on the ſubject of yours of the third. It was oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by a repreſentation from the colonel of the thirteenth Virginia regiment which was raiſed (as colonel M'Kay's and Cooke's were) to remain upon the frontier. Were this the caſe with only one regiment, I ſhould not heſitate, conſidering the face of affairs to the weſtward, to order it immediately to Fort-Pitt or the neighborhood. But the eighth and twelfth Pennſylvania, and the twelfth and thirteenth Virginia, all claim the ſame right; and if the indulgence is granted to one, the others will be diſſatisfied: and to ſpare them all at this time is impoſſible.</p>
                  <p>To regain the deſerters from thoſe regiments is certainly a very deſirable thing; and the mode you point out is the moſt
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:031423_0492_0FEC5F01A224B518"/>
probable. But I fear, if thoſe men who are now here find that the deſerters are not to be brought down to join their regiments in camp, that they may be induced to go off, in hopes of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the ſame terms. I confeſs I am much embarraſſed by this matter, and ſhall be exceedingly glad to have the advice and aſſiſtance of Congreſs and the board upon the ſubject, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I come to any determination. It is an evil that will ever reſult from enliſtments for local purpoſes, when it is not conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient to abide by the agreement.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall immediately tranſmit the papers, incloſed in yours of the fourth, to general Howe.</p>

                  <p>ON ſunday night I had the honor to receive your favors of the firſt and fifth inſtant, with their incloſures.</p>
                  <p>I am happy to find that my paſt conduct reſpecting citizens, in the correſpondence between general Howe and myſelf, is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved by Congreſs. They may reſt aſſured that their rights are ſtrongly impreſſed on my mind; and that, in all my tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions, every ſupport in my power ſhall be given them. I know their importance; and, in my expected negociations with general Howe, if poſſible, I will exempt citizens from captivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. However I cannot hope to effect it, as I cannot demand it as a matter of right, ſince Congreſs themſelves, in their ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal reſolve directing a propoſition to be made for the exchange of priſoners, mentioned that of citizens,—which implied a right of capturing them.</p>
                  <p>They may be aſſured that general Lee will not be forgotten. He has all along been a principal object in diſpute: and, ſo far from doing any thing injurious to him, his right to be exchang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and his releaſement, are intended to be placed upon the moſt explicit, unambiguous footing.—Indeed, from the ſpirit of general Howe's letters collectively taken, ſince his agreement to enlarge the officers on parole in the firſt inſtance, and his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſion

of it in the exchange,—though they are not free from ambiguities,—it may be inferred, that, on ſending in lieutenant-colonel Campbell and the Heſſian field-officers captured at Trenton, an exchange of all officers will immediately commence. It ſeems to be a point with him that it ſhall begin with them, as they have been longeſt in captivity.—I have taken the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to incloſe you copies of three letters which have juſt paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed between general Howe and myſelf, more particularly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning general Lee, in which I have puſhed matters reſpecting him as far as I thought it prudent at this time.—Every pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caution will certainly be uſed to prevent the enemy gaining a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny advantage in the exchange of priſoners.</p>
                  <p>With great deference, I would take the liberty to obſerve that Congreſs ſeemed to have carried the preamble of their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve of the twenty-ſixth ultimo, prohibiting the enliſting, &amp;c. priſoners and deſerters, too far; and, through accident, to have recited a fact that has never happened (at leaſt to my know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge), and which is injurious to us,—<abbr>viz.</abbr> that priſoners had been enliſted by us. If any have, it is what I never knew. However, be this as it may, if the reſolution has not been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, I could wiſh the preamble to be altered, and only to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite, "<hi>that experience,</hi> &amp;c. in <hi>deſerters</hi>" only. The reſolution itſelf may ſtand as it does, comprehending a prohibition againſt the enliſtment of both.</p>
                  <p>My reaſon for troubling Congreſs upon this occaſion is,—we have always complained againſt general Howe, and ſtill do, for obliging and permitting the priſoners in his hands to enliſt, as an unwarrantable procedure, and wholly repugnant to the ſpirit at leaſt of the cartel. This preamble ſeems to admit the practice on our part, which would certainly juſtify it in him, and is ſuch evidence as muſt ſilence us in future (ſhould it ſtand), and afford him an opportunity for recrimination,—though, as I have ſuggeſted, I believe no priſoners have ever been enliſted by us,—I am ſure, none have through compul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion.</p>
                  <p>I have the pleaſure to tranſmit you an extract of a letter from captain Barry, which will inform you of his ſucceſſes. The two ſhips he burned after ſtripping them; and he was o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged, it ſeems, two days after the capture, to ground and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandon the ſchooner, after a long and ſevere engagement with ſome of the enemy's frigates and ſmaller armed veſſels.—It is ſaid he ſaved her guns and moſt of her tackle.</p>

the uniformity of ſentiment held forth by theſe gentlemen, it is much to be feared the meaſures lately adopted by the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioners at New-haven, for regulating the prices of proviſion, will have a diſagreeable effect upon our ſupplies of meat.—How far it may be practicable to ſuſpend their operation for a time, I cannot determine: but, if it can be done, it appears we ſhould experience many advantages from it. It is a matter of great importance; and as ſuch, is ſubmitted to Congreſs for their conſideration.—If any thing can be done to procure ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies of proviſion, particularly of the ſalt kind, I ſhould ſuppoſe, and am perſuaded, it will not be omitted.</p>

                  <p>THIS will be preſented to you by count Pulaſki, who, from a conviction that his remaining at the head of the cavalry was a conſtant ſubject of uneaſineſs to the principal officers of that corps, has been induced to reſign his command. Waving a minute inquiry into the cauſes of diſſatisfaction,—which may be reduced perhaps to the diſadvantages under which he labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as a ſtranger not well acquainted with the language, genius and manners of this country,—it may be ſufficient to obſerve that the degree of harmony which is inſeparable from the well-being and conſequent utility of a corps, has not ſubſiſted in the cavalry ſince his appointment, and that the moſt effectual as well as the eaſieſt remedy is that which he has generouſly applied.</p>
                  <p>The count however, far from being diſguſted with the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, is led by his thirſt of glory, and zeal for the cauſe of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, to ſolicit farther employment, and waits upon the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to make his propoſals. They are briefly that he be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to raiſe an independent corps compoſed of ſixty-eight horſe and two hundred foot,—the horſe to be armed with lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and the foot equipped in the manner of light infantry. The former he thinks he can readily fill with natives of good character and worthy the truſt repoſed in them. With reſpect to the other, he is deſirous of more latitude, ſo as to have li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty of engaging priſoners and deſerters from the enemy.</p>
                  <p>The original plan for the lance-men was to have draughted them from the regiments of horſe. But, as this method would produce a claſhing of intereſts and perhaps occaſion new diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bances, the count prefers having a corps totally unconnected
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:031423_0495_0FEC5F51F763EA98"/>
with any other. My advice to him, therefore, is to enliſt his number of cavalry with the continental bounty; and, if it ſhould be found conſonant to the views of Congreſs to allow his raiſing the number propoſed over and above the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the horſe, then he would have them on the footing of an independent corps: if not, he might at all events have them as draughts; and in this caſe there would be no ground for complaint.</p>
                  <p>With regard to the infantry, which the count eſteems eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to the ſucceſs of the cavalry, I have informed him that the enliſting deſerters and priſoners is prohibited by a late reſolve of Congreſs.—How far Congreſs might be inclined to make an exception, and licenſe the engaging priſoners in a particular detached corps, in which ſuch characters may be admitted with leſs danger than promiſcuouſly in the line,—I cannot undertake to pronounce.</p>
                  <p>I have only to add that the count's valor and active zeal on all occaſions have done him great honor; and, from a perſua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that, by being leſs expoſed to the inconveniences which he has hitherto experienced, he will render great ſervices with ſuch a command as he aſks for, I wiſh him to ſucceed in his application.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE the honor to tranſmit you a letter from gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor Clinton which he incloſed to me for my peruſal and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration.—The inconvenience he mentions, as reſulting from the reſolve reſpecting the appointment of a commandant for Forts Montgomery and Clinton, requires to be obviated. I do not conceive it to have been the deſign of Congreſs to make the command of thoſe forts altogether diſtinct and independent on the general command of the poſts in that quarter; but only to deſignate the rank of the officer who ſhould have the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate charge of them.</p>
                  <p>There is ſuch an intimate connexion between the forts and the other poſts and paſſes in the Highlands and their vicinity, that it is neceſſary for one officer to have the ſuperintendency
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:031423_0496_0FEC5F541961E8D8"/>
and control of the whole, and to be anſwerable for all. If this were not to be the caſe, but the command were not to be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided, there might want that co-operation between the garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and the troops without, which might be eſſential to their preſervation and to the common purpoſes of defence. The aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning a fixed number of men to the garriſons would not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move this inconvenience; for the co-operation would ſtill be neceſſary. But if it were otherwiſe, I ſhould not think the meaſure adviſable, becauſe we do not know what number of men we may have in the field next campaign; and the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber for the defence of the Highlands muſt be proportioned to the general ſtrength; and the force of the garriſons, to that number.</p>
                  <p>On theſe conſiderations, having ordered general M'Dougal to repair to the Highlands to aſſume the chief command there, I have comprehended the forts among the other objects of his truſt; in the diſcharge of which, I am perſuaded he will mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt adequate zeal and ability. But as the reſolve in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion affords room for doubt, it will be proper to have it ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, ſo as more explicitly to aſcertain the intention of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs.</p>
                  <p>I am perfectly in ſentiment with governor Clinton on the propriety of drawing the troops from the northward to reinforce and carry on the works in the Highlands. From every thing I can learn, there ſeems to be no proſpect of proſecuting the intended expedition into Canada. If ſo, I apprehend it can anſwer no valuable end to keep a body of troops in and about Albany.—In the preſent circumſtances of Canada, little is to be dreaded thence: the enemy, in all probability, will be well ſatisfied to act on the defenſive, without riſking the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of an attempt againſt us. A proper garriſon at Fort-Schuyler, and a ſmall party by way of guard at Albany, with the militia of the country that may be occaſionally drawn to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, will be a ſufficient ſecurity againſt the inroads from the enemy from Canada, or the depredations of the neighbouring Indians, ſuppoſing there were any of the tribes whoſe diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were ſtill actively hoſtile notwithſtanding our late northern ſucceſſes,—which is by no means a natural ſuppoſition.—All the men, more than are wanted for theſe purpoſes, would be of the moſt important utility in the Highlands.</p>
                  <p>If the arms and ſtores at Albany ſhould be thought an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to the plan, I would beg leave to obſerve that Albany appears to me a moſt improper place for ſtationary arſenals or magazines, and that thoſe which are there at preſent ſhould
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:031423_0497_0FEC5F5814B29198"/>
be removed without delay. Beſides, as they would be in moſt danger from an incurſion up the North-river, the beſt way to counteract that danger is to ſtrengthen the paſſes in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, and obſtruct the navigation; in order to which the rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forcing them with the troops from the northward would be no inconſiderable ſtep.—With the greateſt reſpect, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>THIS will be delivered to you by captain Sullivan, who waits on Congreſs upon the ſubject of pay and the loſs of his rank in the line of the Maſſachuſetts officers.—He is one of the gentlemen, who, in going with major Sherburne to relieve the poſt we had at the cedars in 1776, after a brave and gallant conduct, fell into the enemy's hands. In a few days after, on the treaty which general Arnold made, he generouſly offered himſelf, as I have been informed, and went one of the hoſtages to Quebec, for the performance of it.</p>
                  <p>By ſome means the ſtate of Maſſachuſetts-Bay has not conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued him in their line, nor has he any appointment in the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. He is now on parole, through the indulgence of general Carleton, and has applied to me for pay and rations from the time of his return: and conſidering alſo the deprivation of his rank as hard and injurious, he hopes he will be provided for in a ſuitable manner, and according to that ſtanding which he for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly held in the army.</p>
                  <p>Captain Sullivan's wiſhes, in either inſtance, cannot be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered by me.—As to the firſt, the reſolution of the nineteenth of January, regulating the pay of priſoners (which is the only rule for my government) ſeems to have drawn the line between officers on parole who are continued in ſervice, and thoſe who are not; and, making that the only criterion to fix pay, to have precluded every other diſcrimination: and the powers, which were veſted in the reſpective ſtates to appoint officers, prohibit any interference by me in his favor, as to the latter.</p>
                  <p>I have ſtated the nature of the captain's claims, and the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons which are oppoſed to his obtaining relief in either inſtance from me. I ſhall only add that the neglect by the ſtates (in their appointments) of the officers who were in captivity, where there was no other objection to them, was at leaſt ungenerous, if not impolitic and unjuſt. It has been the caſe in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances: and as to the gentlemen who is particularly the ſubject
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:031423_0498_0FEC5F5A67C580D8"/>
of this letter, the teſtimonials that have been given of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter as an officer were much in his favor, and greatly to his honor.</p>
                  <p>By accident, the reſolution of the nineteenth of January, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luded to above, has been miſlaid. I muſt trouble you with a requeſt for another copy of it.</p>
                  <p>I tranſmit Congreſs colonel * * *'s application to reſign. As general Huntington, in whoſe brigade he is, and in whom I have the utmoſt confidence, is perfectly willing, I have only to ſay upon the occaſion that I have not the ſmalleſt objection to the meaſure.</p>
                  <p>General Sullivan ſet out for Rhode-Iſland on friday laſt, to take the command there in conſequence of the reſolution of Congreſs directing me to ſend a major-general there for that purpoſe.

                  <p>ON ſaturday I had the honor to receive your favor of the tenth, with the reſolutions alluded to.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed I take the liberty to tranſmit an extract of a letter juſt received from general Parſons.—This, as well as the letter which I incloſed you yeſterday from governor Clinton, will ſhew the confuſion in the management of affairs on the North-river. I informed Congreſs then that I had ſent general M'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Dongal to take the chief command there, comprehending the forts,—which appeared to me the only effectual means for cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing all diſorders, and promoting the public ſervice.—To remove all impediments, it were to be wiſhed that Congreſs would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt him with every neceſſary power for carrying into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the objects of his command: and it might be well if they were to extend to any future commanding officer, as it would prevent thoſe difficulties which have heretofore ariſen from their having been conſidered as merely perſonal.</p>
                  <p>I am more and more in ſentiment with governor Clinton on the propriety and abſolute neceſſity of drawing the troops from the northward, to reinforce and carry on the works in the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands. From the information I have from colonel Radiere who has juſt come from thence, I find that the intended defences are far leſs advanced than I had any idea of. According to him, little or nothing is yet done, though I have repeatedly and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:031423_0499_0FEC5F651DDBAD40"/>
urged the proſecution of them with all poſſible induſtry. The incloſed copies of my letters to general Putnam will ſhew that I have uniformly preſſed the cloſeſt attention to the buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,—though it might be inferred from general Parſons's let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that there had been ſome inconſiſtency in my orders. There remains but a little time to do a great deal in; and I fear that no exertions now will be ſufficient to place things in that quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter on the ſecure and reſpectable footing we could wiſh. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, we ſhould do the moſt we can: and if the works can not be as complete as they ought, the troops will be there; and a reliance muſt be had in their bravery, to repel any attempt that may be formed againſt them.</p>

                  <p>HEREWITH I do myſelf the honor to incloſe copies of a letter from an officer of militia in Elizabethtown, to me, and an extract of a letter from one of Mr. Boudinot's deputies at Boſton, to him,—both tending to induce a belief that the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my have ſome enterpriſe in contemplation. What this is, time muſt diſcover.—I have this whole winter been clearly of opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion that general Howe's movements would be very early this ſpring, to take advantage of the weak ſtate of our army,—or late, if he expected conſiderable reinforcements from England, and meant to avail himſelf of his full ſtrength. If the firſt takes place, as appearances indicate, it may, I think, be conſidered as a proof of one or both of theſe two things,—that he is either well informed (he cannot indeed be otherwiſe) of the ſituation, and more than probably, of the ſtrength of our army,—or that he expects no conſiderable reinforcements this year from Europe. In either caſe it is our indiſpenſable duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inforce and arrange our army as ſpeedily as poſſible, that we may in the firſt inſtance be prepared for defence,—in the ſecond, take advantage of any favorable circumſtance which may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, to injure the enemy.</p>
                  <p>Whatever may be the deſigns of Congreſs with reſpect to the eſtabliſhment of the army, I know not: but I do moſt earneſtly and devoutly recommend a ſpeedy adoption of them, and the appointment of officers, as our preſent ſituation at this advanced ſeaſon is truly alarming, and to me highly diſtreſſing, as I am convinced that we ſhall be plunged into the campaign before our arrangements are made, and the army properly organized.</p>
                  <p>The numberleſs diſadvantages reſulting from the late appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of general officers laſt year, make me look forward with infinite anxiety, this:—for, after all the wiſdom that Congreſs or their committee can uſe in the choice of officers, many will be diſguſted: reſignations of ſome and perhaps non-acceptance of others will follow. Before matters then can be brought to a proper tone, much time will be loſt, and a great deal of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and vexation encountered,—to overcome which, is not the work of a day: and, till they are overcome, confuſion, diſorder, and loſs, muſt prevail. In the mean while, order, regularity,
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:031423_0501_0FEC5F6D5B589C40"/>
and diſcipline, which require the vigilance of every officer to eſtabliſh, and muſt flow from the general officers in every army,—are neglected, or not entered upon in time, to effect. Thus it happened laſt year, and brigades and diviſions became vacant, to the great injury of the ſervice.</p>
                  <p>As it is not improper for Congreſs to have ſome idea of the preſent temper of the army, it may not ne amiſs to remark in this place, that, ſince the month of Auguſt laſt, between two and three hundred officers have reſigned their commiſſions, and many others were with difficulty diſſuaded from it. In the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginia line only, not leſs than ſix colonels, as good as any in the ſervice, have left it lately; and more, I am told, are in the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mor to do ſo.</p>
                  <p>Highly advantageous alſo would it be, if the recruits and draughts from North-Carolina and Virginia were not ſuffered to halt on their way to camp under pretence of getting equip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped, but ſent forward and incorporated into the different regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their reſpective ſtates as ſoon as it could be done. Out of the number of men ſaid to be draughted in Virginia laſt fall, and others from North-Carolina, very few have joined the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; but, owing to deſertion and other cauſes, they have dwin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled to nothing: and this will always be the caſe with new re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruits, eſpecially thoſe who are unwillingly drawn forth, if much time is ſpent in getting them to their regiments under the care of proper officers. This ſhews the neceſſity (if the ſeaſon and other powerful reaſons did not loudly call for it) of haſtening them to the army.</p>
                  <p>My ſolicitude for the preſervation of the communication of the North-river gives me very uneaſy ſenſations on account of our poſts there, and will excuſe my again aſking if the troops to the northward, except ſuch as are neceſſary for the defence of Fort-Schuyler, can be ſo advantageouſly employed as at the works on that river.—A reſpectable force at thoſe poſts would awe New-York, and divide general Howe's force or expoſe the city.—To depend too much upon militia, is, in my opinion, putting every thing to hazard.</p>
                  <p>If I ſhould appear uncommonly anxious reſpecting the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral matters contained in this letter, by repeating them,—Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs will do me the juſtice, I hope, to believe that I am actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated by no views but ſuch as are prompted by circumſtances and the advanced ſeaſon.—With the greateſt reſpect, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE been honored with yours of the twenty-fifth, incloſing duplicates of two former reſolves of Congreſs, and a reſolve of the twenty-third inſtant, accepting the reſignation of colonel Charles Webb.</p>
                  <p>Since mine of the twenty-fourth, Mr. Boudinot has commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated the following intelligence, being part of a letter to him:—"I have lately received ſome intelligence from New-York, that we may make ourſelves eaſy in Jerſey, as all the force that can be ſpared is to be ſent to join general Howe.—Two thouſand five hundred are actually on board tranſports, and lying at the watering place."</p>
                  <p>I have this day received a letter from general Smallwood, dated yeſterday at Wilmington, in which he ſays—"The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, about four days ago, had a fleet of near fifty ſail ſtanding up the river, which I fancy was from New-York; and yeſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day their foraging fleet went up without touching upon this ſide the Delaware, except three or four ſmall parties about Port-Penn, who have been conſtantly drove off by a party of about a hundred of our men, who have been guarding and aid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the removal of the forage, which is at length happily ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected."</p>
                  <p>A Philadelphia paper of the twenty-ſeventh alſo mentions, that a fleet of upwards of forty ſail had left the Hook on ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day, and that they were ſaid to be in the river.</p>
                  <p>From all the above circumſtances, I have no doubt but the troops have arrived from New-York.—I have heard nothing further from Rhode-Iſland ſince I wrote to you laſt.</p>

                  <p>SINCE I had the honor of addreſſing you upon the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ninth ultimo, I have not been able to learn with any preci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion whether the tranſports that arrived brought any conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble number of troops.—A Heſſian de<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>erter ſays there were only a few German convaleſcents on board. If ſo, the fleet with two thouſand five hundred, mentioned in my laſt, is not arrived, ſuppoſing they were bound to Philadelphia.</p>
                  <p>General St. Clair arrived yeſterday from Boſton: and, as he ſeems very anxious to have his matter determined one way or the other, I beg leave to recal the attention of Congreſs to my letter of the twenty-ſeventh of February upon that ſubject.—Having received no information ſince that time which ſerves to direct my judgment as to the charges which it will be proper to exhibit againſt general St. Clair, I have only again to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt that Congreſs or the committee will be pleaſed to point out the particular charges upon which the court ſhall proceed.</p>
                  <p>I could wiſh this matter might not be delayed; on ſeveral ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts. General St. Clair is in a very delicate ſituation, and feels it ſenſibly. He was kept inactive great part of laſt cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign, and probably will be the whole of this, except his trial can be ſhortly brought on,—as it will be almoſt impoſſible to find time to hold a court after the ſcene of action opens.—If he ſhould be acquitted, he would render very eſſential ſervice, eſpecially at this time when we have ſo few general officers: if condemned, his place may be immediately filled. It will beſides take him ſome little time to prepare for his defence after he knows the particular charges alledged againſt him.</p>

                  <p>CAPTAIN Lee of the light dragoons, and the officers under his command, having uniformly diſtinguiſhed themſelves by a conduct of exemplary zeal, prudence, and bravery, I took occaſion, on a late ſignal inſtance of it, to expreſs the high ſenſe I entertained of their merit, and to aſſure him that it ſhould not fail of being properly noticed. I was induced to give this aſſurance from a conviction that it is the wiſh of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs to give every encouragement to merit, and that they would cheerfully embrace ſo favorable an opportunity of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſting this diſpoſition.</p>

I had it in contemplation at the time, in caſe no other me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod more eligible could be adopted, to make him an offer of a place in my family. I have conſulted the committee of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs upon the ſubject, and we were mutually of opinion that the giving captain Lee the command of two troops of horſe on the propoſed eſtabliſhment, with the rank of major, to act as an independent partiſan corps, would be a mode of rewarding him, very advantageous to the ſervice. Captain Lee's genius par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly adapts him to a command of this nature; and it will be the moſt agreeable to him, of any ſtation in which he could be placed.</p>
                  <p>I beg leave to recommend this meaſure to Congreſs, and ſhall be obliged by their deciſion as ſpeedily as may be conve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nient. The campaign is faſt approaching, and there will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably be very little time to raiſe and prepare the corps for it.

                  <p>I HAVE now the honor to acknowledge your ſeveral letters of the twenty-firſt, twenty-ninth, and thirtieth ultimo, with their incloſures, which have been duly received.—It gives me pain to obſerve they appear to contain ſeveral implications by which my ſenſibility is not a little wounded.—I find myſelf extremely embarraſſed by the ſteps I had taken towards an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of priſoners and the formation of a general cartel mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more ample proviſion for their future accommodation and relief. The views of Congreſs ſeem to be very different from what I ſuppoſed them when I entered into my late engagements with general Howe: their reſolution of the thirtieth ultimo, pointedly requiring a ſtrict adherence to all former ones upon the ſubject, will in all probability render them impracticable.—I conſidered ſome of their reſolutions as dictated on the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of retaliation, and did not imagine the terms they contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed would be inſiſted upon in negociating an agreement calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated to remedy the evil which occaſioned them. In moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects they might be ſubſtantially complied with: but there are ſome points to which an exact conformity muſt of neceſſity deſtroy the idea of a cartel. One is the obliging the enemy to pay gold and ſilver on equal terms for continental curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy,
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:031423_0505_0FEC5F33760FB0F0"/>
eſtimating the articles ſupplied them at their actual prices with us, as ſeems to be the deſign of the reſolve of the nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth of December.—Another is the ſubjecting the inhabitants of theſe ſtates, taken in arms againſt them, to trial and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, agreeable to the reſolve of the thirtieth of the ſame month.</p>
                  <p>I am well aware that appearances ought to be upheld, and that we ſhould avoid as much as poſſible recogniſing by any public act the depreciation of our currency; but I conceive this end would be anſwered as far as might be neceſſary, by ſtipulating that all money payments ſhould be made in gold and ſilver, being the common medium of commerce among na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, at the rate of four ſhillings and ſixpence for a Spaniſh milled dollars, &amp;c.—by fixing the price of rations on an equi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſcale relatively to our reſpective circumſtances,—and providing for the payment of what we may owe, by ſending in proviſion, and ſelling it at their market. The rates of money, and the prices of proviſions and other commodities, differ every where: and, in treaties of a ſimilar nature between any two ſtates, it is requiſite, for mutual convenience, to aſcertain ſome common ratio both for the value of money in payments, and for the rates of thoſe articles on which they may ariſe.</p>
                  <p>It was determined on mature conſideration not to conclude any thing expreſsly that ſhould contradict the reſolution of the thirtieth December: but at the ſame time, if it is deſigned to be the rule of practice, it is eaſy to perceive it would at once overturn any cartel that could be formed. General Howe would never conſent to obſerve it on his part, if ſuch a practice were to exiſt on ours.—Though the law ought not to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travened by an expreſs article admitting the exchangeability of ſuch perſons, yet, if it is not ſuffered to ſleep, it is in vain to expect the operation of it will be acquieſced in by the enemy.</p>
                  <p>The meaſures I have taken muſt evince that it is my deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to pay the fulleſt attention to the intereſts of citizens, and to the rights of general Lee, in the treaty: and I think it but juſtice to the gentlemen appointed to negotiate it, to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare that I know them to be ſo fully impreſſed with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of both thoſe objects, as to make them cheerfully ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervant of the injunctions of Congreſs, ſo far as not to conclude any agreement of which the exchange of general Lee and the alternative reſpecting citizens are not eſſential parts.—Theſe points had been early determined on.</p>
                  <p>It is with no ſmall concern that I have been obliged to trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Congreſs upon the ſubjects of this letter: and, ſhould they
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:031423_0506_0FEC5F78D0E7E180"/>
appear to them in the ſame light they do to me, and they ſhould think proper to remove the obſtacles which now oppoſe the buſineſs in hand, I muſt requeſt they will be pleaſed to communicate their determination as expeditiouſly as poſſible, that the commiſſioners may govern themſelves accordingly and either proceed to forming a cartel, or put an end to the nego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiation.—Before the reſolves of the thirteenth came to hand, they had met, and been in treaty two days, with a proſpect of a favorable accommodation.</p>
                  <p>I am happy to inform Congreſs that general Lee will be out on parole to-morrow in place of general Preſcot: and I have every reaſon to expect, if the negotiation can be continued up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on admiſſible terms, that his exchange will immediately follow the releaſement of colonel Campbell and the Heſſian field-offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers. It is agreed that lieutenant-colonel Allen ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed for lieutenant-colonel Campbell.</p>
                  <p>The importunate applications of colonel Lee and major Swazey to leave the ſervice oblige me to lay the matter before Congreſs. Colonel Lee's letter upon the ſubject was tranſmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted me the twenty-fifth of January: but, hoping he might change his mind, I deferred writing to Congreſs upon his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt. He has renewed it again in urgent terms, through general Heath, and I have only to obſerve that it is a painful circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance to ſee officers of their merit leaving the ſervice.—It is the caſe every day.—I ſhall be obliged by Congreſs informing me of the dates of the reſignations of the colonels in the Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia line:—I have only received the date of colonel Lewis's.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed is a letter from captain Cotteneau of the ſhip Fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinand, with an invoice of her cargo. The letter only came to hand yeſterday: and, as it is of an old date, it is highly proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that the goods are ſold. If they are not,—from the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain's deſire to give the public a preference in the ſale, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs will have an opportunity of directing them to be purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>

                  <p>I HAVE had the honor of receiving your favor of the fourth inſtant, incloſing a reſolve of Congreſs, of the ſame date, empowering me to call forth five thouſand militia from the ſtates of Maryland, Pennſylvania, and New-Jerſey. I thank Congreſs for the power: at the ſame time it is incumbent on me to aſſure them, that,—granting the practicability of collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſuch a number,—it would prove a work of time, difficulty, and expenſe; to evince which, I need only recur to the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of laſt campaign on ſimilar occaſions, and to remind you that it was not poſſible to obtain a thouſand men, nor ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times even one hundred, from this ſtate, although the former number was required and promiſed, for the purpoſe of cover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing during the winter the country between Schuylkill and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laware.</p>
                  <p>As this reſolve appears to have been made in conſequence of my letters of the twenty-fourth and twenty-ninth ultimo, which were founded on conjecture, and, in ſome degree, miſinforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,—and as the execution of it would, excluſive of the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniences abovementioned, I am perſuaded have a tendency to injure the completion of the continental regiments,—I ſhall call for a ſmall part only of the number allowed; but could wiſh that Hartley's regiment were ordered immediately to camp, and the duties of it performed by militia. In like manner I would propoſe that all remote guards ſhould be compoſed of militia, and that the ſeveral purpoſes for which men are drawn from the continental troops ſhould be anſwered by them. This would be a means of drawing together a conſiderable number of men who are in a manner loſt to the army, and of employing the militia to the beſt advantage poſſible.</p>
                  <p>The great end of my letter to Congreſs of the twenty-fourth ultimo, ſeems to have been miſtaken. My views were not turned to reinforcements of militia. To know whether the old eſtabliſhment of the army, or the new as agreed upon by the committee, is the choice of Congreſs,—and in what manner the
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:031423_0508_0FEC601776B0BB80"/>
regiments of this ſtate and the additionals are to be reduced,—officers for the whole appointed, &amp;c. were my objects. Theſe are objects of the greateſt moment, as they may, in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences, involve the fate of America; for I will undertake to ſay, that it is next to impoſſible, when the ſeaſon is ſo far ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced, properly to accompliſh thoſe changes, appointments, and the dependent arrangements for the enſuing campaign. Should any convulſion happen, or movement take place, they will be altogether impracticable.—Juſtice to my own character, as well as duty to the public, conſtrain me to repeat theſe things: their conſequences are more eaſily conceived than deſcribed.</p>
                  <p>It may be ſaid by ſome, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ir, that my wiſh to ſee the officers of this army upon a more reſpectable eſtabliſhment, is the cauſe of my ſolicitude, and carries me too far.—To ſuch I can declare that my anxiety proceeds from the cauſes abovementioned. If my opinion is aſked with reſpect to the neceſſity of making this proviſion for the officers, I am ready to declare that I do moſt religiouſly believe the ſalvation of the cauſe depends upon it,—and, without it, your officers will moulder to nothing, or be compoſed of low and illiterate men, void of capacity for this or any other buſineſs. To prove this, I can with truth aver, that ſcarce a day paſſes, without the offer of one or two commiſſions; and my advices from the eaſtward and ſouthward are that num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers who had gone home on furlough mean not to return, but are eſtabliſhing themſelves in more lucrative employments.—Let congreſs determine what will be the conſequence of this ſpirit.</p>
                  <p>Perſonally, as an officer, I have no intereſt in their deciſion, becauſe I have declared, and I now repeat it, that I never will receive the ſmalleſt benefit from the half-pay eſtabliſhment: but, as a man who fights under the weight of a proſcription, and as a citizen who wiſhes to ſee the liberty of his country eſtabliſhed upon a permanent foundation, and whoſe property depends up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſucceſs of our arms, I am deeply intereſted. But,—all this apart, and juſtice out of the queſtion,—upon the ſingle ground of economy and public ſaving, I will maintain the utili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of it: for I have not the leaſt doubt, that, until officers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider their commiſſions in an honorable and intereſted point of view, and are afraid to endanger them by negligence and inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, no order, regularity, or care either of the men or pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic property, will prevail. * * *</p>
                  <p>By officers who are juſt returned from Maſſachuſetts-Bay, I learn that there is not the leaſt proſpect of getting men from thence before the month of June,—if then; and indeed that
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:031423_0509_0FEC5FAA0FD25E88"/>
there is no reaſon to expect any number that will deſerve the name of reinforcement for the continental regiments this cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paign,—the towns being only called upon to furniſh the defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciency of their laſt year's quota, ſo that all ſubſequent caſualties are diſregarded, and the fifteen regiments from that ſtate, which may now perhaps want four thouſand men to complete them, will receive only five hundred if the towns came within that number of their complement laſt year.—What change the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of Congreſs, of the [<hi>twenty-ſixth</hi>] of February, may ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, I ſhall not undertake to ſay:—if it has not a ſpeedy and powerful operation, our proſpects in that quarter will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedingly unpromiſing.</p>
                  <p>A gentleman from New-Hampſhire ſome little time ſince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me that matters were nearly in the ſame train there, notwithſtanding a reſolve for the completion of their batallions; and the incloſed copy of a letter (No. 1) from general Putnam, whom I have deſired to remain in Connecticut for ſome time in order to forward the recruits from that ſtate, conveys his ideas of what may be expected from thence. What New-York, New-Jerſey, and North-Carolina have done or are about to do, I know not.—Pennſylvania and Maryland have tried the effect of voluntary enliſtments to little purpoſe; and the firſt, in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect contradiction to the moſt pointed injunctions laid on the officers, have their recruits compoſed chiefly of deſerters, who will embrace the firſt opportunity of eſcaping with our arms.—Virginia, it is true, has proceeded to a draught: but the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, beſides being in itſelf inadequate, has been leſſened by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion; and the deficiency of the regiments, on the other hand, being increaſed by death and deſertion, their ſtrength will pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably fall very far ſhort of the new eſtabliſhment.</p>
                  <p>This, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ir, is not a flattering picture of our affairs: but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſentation is juſt; and it is incumbent on me to exhibit it in my own defence, as, notwithſtanding all theſe unfavorable cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances,—and what is to me a certain proſpect of being plunged into the campaign before the arrangements are made, officers appointed, &amp;c.—great matters, I perceive, are expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from our activity this ſpring:—in proportion therefore will the diſappointment be felt by thoſe who are the moſt ſanguine. For want of the ratification of Congreſs, the horſe eſtabliſhment, companies of ſappers, provoſt-marſhalſey, &amp;c. &amp;c. (as agreed to by the committee, and recommended to their conſideration) are entirely at a ſtand, at a time when we ought to be deriving be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefits from their execution.—In a word, at no period ſince the commencement of the war have I felt more painful ſenſations on
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:031423_0510_0FEC5F0463417788"/>
account of delay, than at the preſent, and, urged by them, I have expreſſed myſelf without reſerve.</p>
                  <p>By a letter juſt received from general Weedon, I am inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of his intention to reſign, if general Woodford ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtored to his former rank, which he had not then heard. General Muhlenberg is now balancing on the ſame point. One, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, if not two brigadiers, will be wanted for that ſtate.—The diſadvantages reſulting from the frequent reſignations in the Virginia line, the changes of commanding officers to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giments, and other cauſes equally diſtreſſing, have injured that corps beyond conception, and have been the means of reducing very reſpectable regiments in ſome inſtances to a mere handful of men; and this will ever be the caſe till officers can be fixed by ſomething equivalent to the ſacrifice they make. To reaſon otherwiſe, and ſuppoſe that public virtue alone will enable men to forego the caſe and comforts of life, to encounter the hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips and dangers of war for a bare ſubſiſtence, when their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions and friends are amaſſing large fortunes,—is viewing hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man nature rather as it ſhould be, than as it really is.</p>
                  <p>The clothier-general of the army, as well as the heads of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very other department, ſhould be in camp, near the commander in chief: otherwiſe it is impoſſible that the operations of war can be conducted with energy and preciſion. I wiſh moſt ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely that this,—as not the leaſt eſſential part of the buſineſs ſettled with the committee,—were decided, and a thorough in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigation were had into the conduct of this department; as it is a matter of univerſal aſtoniſhment that we ſhould be deficient in any article of clothing, when it is commonly aſſerted that the eaſtern ſtates alone can furniſh materials enough to clothe a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand men.—If this be a fact, there is a fatal error ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where, to which may be attributed the death and deſertion of thouſands.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall make no apology for the freedom of this letter.—To inform Congreſs of ſuch facts as materially affect the ſervice, I conceive to be one great and eſſential part of my duty to them and myſelf. My agreement with the committee entitled me to expect upwards of forty thouſand continental troops, excluſive of artillery and horſe, for the ſervice of the enſuing campaign, including thoſe to be employed in the defence of the North ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver.—Inſtead of theſe, what are my proſpects?</p>
                  <p>Major-general the marquis De la Fayette is arrived in camp, and will reſume the command of his diviſion.—The baron De Kalb is expected in a few days. The incloſure, No. 2, is the copy of a letter from colonel Shrieve of the ſecond Jerſey ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tallion,

containing an account of the deſtruction of the ſalt and ſalt-works at Squan,—and No. 3, of a letter from general M'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Dougal, ſhewing the ſtate of affairs in that department.—With very great reſpect, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>By poſtponing my call upon the militia, as mentioned in my laſt of the tenth, I did not mean to decline it altogether.

The incloſed draught of a bill was brought to head-quarters yeſterday afternoon by a gentleman who informed me that a large cargo of them had been juſt ſent out of Philadelphia. Whether this inſidious proceeding is genuine and imported in the packet which arrived a few days ago, or contrived in Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, is a point undetermined and immaterial; but it is certainly founded on principles of the moſt * * *,—meant to poiſon the minds of the people, and detach the wavering at leaſt from our cauſe. I ſuppoſe it will obtain a place in the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and am not without anxiety that it will have a malignant influence.—I would ſubmit it whether it will not be highly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient for Congreſs to inveſtigate it in all its parts, and to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe in the moſt ſtriking manner the injuſtice, deluſion, and fraud, it contains.—I truſt it will be attacked, in every ſhape, in every part of the continent.</p>

                  <p>I TAKE the liberty to tranſmit you a letter which I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived yeſterday from governor Tryon, incloſing the draughts of the two bills I forwarded before, with his certificate of the manner in which they came to his hands, accompanied by his
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:031423_0513_0FEC601D82908650"/>
more extraordinary and impertinent requeſt, that, through my means, the contents ſhould be communicated to the officers and men of this army. This engine of miniſtry, from governor Livingſton's account, is very induſtriouſly circulating copies of theſe draughts, in obedience to their and his royal mandates.—The letter which I incloſe, and a triplicate, came to hand at one time: ſome future conveyance, it is probable, will preſent me the duplicate.</p>
                  <p>I would alſo take the liberty to incloſe you the Evening Poſt, No. 475, which governor Livingſton was ſo obliging as to ſend me yeſterday. Were we not fully ſatisfied from our experience, that there are no artifices, no meaſures too * * * for the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my or their adherents to attempt in order to promote their views, we might be aſtoniſhed at the daring confidence, in defi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the opinion of the world, manifeſted in a publication in this paper, purporting to be a reſolution of congreſs, of the twentieth of February. This proceeding is infamous to the laſt degree, and calculated to produce the moſt baneful conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences by exciting an oppoſition in the people to our draught<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſyſtem, and embarraſſing at leaſt the only probable mode now left us for raiſing men. I think it of great importance that the forgery ſhould be announced in the moſt public man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and am the more induced to this opinion from governor Livingſton's account of the diſagreeable operation it has had, and is ſtill likely to produce, if not contradicted. If it is, and with a few ſtrictures, I ſhould hope that it would excite in the breaſts of all our countrymen, a juſt and generous contempt of the enemy for ſuch a dirty, wicked proceeding.</p>

I have thought much upon the ſubject: and ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions reſpecting it were put into the hands of all the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral officers here on tueſday evening, for their conſideration. I alſo intended to ſend a meſſenger this day to meet general Gates, ſuppoſing him to be on his way to Hudſon's-river, and to requeſt his call at this camp, that we might enter into a full and free diſcuſſion on the point.—Their is not a moment to be delayed in forming ſome general ſyſtem, in my opinion; and I only wait the arrival of generals Gates and Mifflin, to ſummon a council for the purpoſe.</p>

                  <p>I HAD the honor yeſterday afternoon to receive your letter of the twenty-fourth, continued to the twenty-fifth, with its important incloſures.—Congreſs will be pleaſed to accept my ſincere thanks for the freſh inſtance of confidence manifeſted in their reſolution of the twenty-third, and other proceedings; and they may reſt aſſured that whatever powers are entruſted to me ſhall be invariably directed to promote the intereſt of theſe ſtates. If in any caſe there ſhould be a miſapplication or a failure in the execution, it will be the effect of miſtake and not of deſign.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall take meaſures for diſtributing the report of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee on Lord North's bills, and the reſolution of the twenty-third inviting delinquents to return to their allegiance and to the protection of theſe ſtates. This proceeding appears to me founded in great good policy; and I ſhould hope that it will
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:031423_0515_0FEC5F18E34F90E8"/>
be attended with many valuable conſequences:—but this can only be proved by the event.</p>
                  <p>Though I wiſh moſt heartily for the aid of general Lee in council and upon every other occaſion,—yet, as the time of his return is uncertain, or at leaſt it will be ſeveral days before it takes place,—and as it ſeems to me that there is not a moment to loſe in forming ſome general ſyſtem for our operations,—I ſhould think it inexpedient for general Gates to delay coming to camp till his arrival. After a plan is digeſted, there will be a great deal of time expended before things will be in a proper train for execution. The ſeaſon is faſt advancing; and the pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod which may be moſt favorable for any deſigns we may form will preſently arrive.</p>
                  <p>I take the liberty to tranſmit an extract of a letter from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Heath, which will ſhew Congreſs that he is preſſed on all ſides for money. Governor Livingſton too is apprehenſive he will be under embarraſſments on account of the purchaſe of horſes in conſequence of the recommendation of the committee. Their letter to him by ſome means has been miſlaid in the aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and he does not know exactly the mode preſcribed for the payment. I cannot inform him myſelf, or do what perhaps is more neceſſary,—furniſh him with money; and therefore hope that Congreſs or the committee will.</p>

                  <p>THE extenſive ill conſequences, ariſing from a want of uniformity in diſcipline and manoeuvres throughout the army, have long occaſioned me to wiſh for the eſtabliſhment of a well-organiſed inſpectorſhip: and the concurrence of Congreſs in the ſame views has induced me to ſet on foot a temporary inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which, from the ſucceſs that has hitherto attended it, gives me the moſt flattering expectations, and will, I hope, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their approbation.</p>
                  <p>Baron De Steuben's length of ſervice in the firſt military ſchool in Europe, and his former rank, pointed him out as a perſon peculiarly qualified to be at the head of this department. This appeared the leaſt exceptionable way of introducing him into the army, and one that would give him the moſt ready op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of diſplaying his talents. I therefore propoſed to
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:031423_0516_0FEC5FB7D9973948"/>
him to undertake the office of inſpector-general, which he a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greed to with the greateſt cheerfulneſs, and has performed the duties of it with a zeal and intelligence equal to our wiſhes. He has two ranks of inſpectors under him: the loweſt are offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers charged with the inſpection of brigades, with the title of brigade-inſpectors: the others ſuperintended ſeveral of theſe: they have written inſtructions relative to their ſeveral func<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and the manoeuvres which they are to practiſe are illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by a company which the baron has taken the pains to train himſelf.</p>
                  <p>The brigade-inſpectors were choſen by the brigadier and the commanding officers of regiments in each brigade. The in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectors are lieutenant eolon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ls Barber of Jerſey, Brooks of Maſſachuſetts, Davis of Virginia, and monſieur Ternant, a French gentleman:—the reaſon for employing him (apart of his intrinſic merit and abilities) was his poſſeſſing the French and Engliſh languages equally, which made him a neceſſary aſſiſtant to the Baron de Steuben. He is content to ſerve without rank, until, after an experiment of his abilities, Congreſs ſhall deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine what he is entitled to.</p>
                  <p>Upon the arrival of lieutenant-colonel Fleury in camp, as he was unemployed, and had exerciſed the office of aid-ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor in France, the Baron propoſed to have him employed as an inſpector; in which I readily acquieſced, as Congreſs had given him the rank and pay of lieutenant-colonel.—There may be other foreign officers in continental pay, idle for want of being attached to ſome corps, of whoſe ſervices we might avail ourſelves this way, which is the only method of diſpoſing of them, unleſs they could be formed into a diſtinct corps.</p>
                  <p>From the extraordinary fatigue and cloſe attention required of the officers employed in the inſpectorſhip, I did not think it amiſs to let them entertain hopes that Congreſs would allow ſome addition to the pay which they derive from their rank; and I take the liberty of recommending the meaſure. I would propoſe twenty dollars, per month for the brigade in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpectors, and thirty for the inſpectors, in addition to their pay in the line.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould do injuſtice if I were to be longer ſilent with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the merits of the baron De Steuben. His knowledge of his profeſſion, added to the zeal which he has diſcovered ſince he began upon the functions of his office, lead me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider him as an acquiſition to the ſervice, and to recommend him to the attention of Congreſs. His expectations with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard

to rank extend to that of major-general. His finances, he ingenuouſly co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>The baron is ſenſible that our ſituation requires a few varia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the duties of his office from the general practice in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, and particularly that they muſt neceſſarily be more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſive; in which, as well as in his inſtructions, he has ſkil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully yielded to circumſtances.—The ſucceſs which has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to attended the plan enables me to requeſt with confidence the ratification of Congreſs, and is, I think, a pledge of the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of a well-combined general ſyſtem, which inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mountable obſtacles have hitherto oppoſed.</p>

In compliance with the requeſt of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, I ſhall immediately call upon the officers in the army to take the oath of allegiance and abjuration.

They went down the Delaware the beginning of the week, light and empty.—I have not been able to learn any thing of their deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tination; nor can I form a conjecture upon the occaſion, that is the leaſt ſatisfactory.</p>

<pb n="222" facs="unknown:031423_0518_0FEC5F7CE8E49CD8"/>
As ſoon as Congreſs may think it expedient, I ſhall be happy to have an opportunity of announcing to the army, with the u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual ceremony, ſuch parts of the intelligence as may be proper, and ſanctioned by authority.

                  <p>IN a late letter from general Schuyler, I received the proceedings of a board of commiſſioners for Indian affairs, held at Albany the fifteenth of laſt month. It appears by them and ſome other accounts I have ſeen, that there is but little proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of ſucceeding in the plan for engaging a body of Indians from that quarter to ſerve with this army. The advantage which the enemy poſſeſſes over us, in having the means of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing preſents much more liberally than we can, has made a ſtrong impreſſion upon their minds, and ſeems to be more than a counterbalance for any arguments we can offer to conciliate their attachment. They alſo appear to be apprehenſive for their own ſafety, and rather to wiſh for aid and protection from us, than willing to leave their habitations and come to our aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance.</p>
                  <p>The meaſure propoſed was by way of experiment, as one which might poſſibly be attended with valuable conſequences, and, if it could have been effected without much difficulty, might have been worth a trial. But, as the ſcheme does not well correſpond with their preſent diſpoſition, and may ſerve to increaſe our embarraſſments in keeping them even in tolera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:031423_0519_0FEC5F351580A380"/>
good humour, I am inclined to think it would be moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſable to relinquiſh the attempt. They may be told of what has happened in Europe, with proper embelliſhments, and that our affairs are now upon ſuch a footing as to render their aid in the field unneceſſary, and that all we require of them is their friendſhip and good wiſhes. This and promiſes of protection may have a powerful and happy effect.</p>
                  <p>It is of great importance to counteract the temptation held out by the enemy, and to ſecure the good will of the Indians, who appear to be at leaſt in a ſtate of heſitancy and indeciſion, if nothing worſe. Congreſs, I am perſuaded, will do every thing in their power to promote theſe deſirable ends.</p>

                  <p>I HAD the honor to receive in due time your ſeveral favors of the third, ſixth, and ninth inſtant, with the papers to which they reſpectively alluded.—After much conſideration upon the ſubject, I have appointed general M'Intoſh to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand at Fort-Pitt and in the weſtern country, for which he will ſet out as ſoon as he can accommodate his affairs. I part with this gentleman with much reluctance, as I eſteem him an officer of great worth and merit, and as I know his ſervices here are and will be materially wanted. His firm diſpoſition and equal juſtice, his aſſiduity and good underſtanding,—added to his being a ſtranger to all parties in that quarter,—pointed him out as a proper perſon; and I truſt, extenſive advantages will be derived, from his command, which I could wiſh was more agreeable.—He will wait on Congreſs for their inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>As lieutenant-colonel Southerland, major Agnew, and lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant Poe, have only requeſted to go to Europe on parole, it does not appear to me that I can with propriety apply to gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Howe for their exchange:—this would imply that they were priſoners of war. Though their exchange is certainly the moſt deſirable mode of releaſe as it would relieve an equal number of our officers from captivity, yet I ſhould be happy if a negotiation for the purpoſe ſhould commence on their part. Knowing that it would be our intereſt to exchange all the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers of general Buygoyne's army if it could be done, I wrote general Heath not long ſince, to take occaſion to mention to them that we ſhould always be willing to accede to any equal
<pb n="225" facs="unknown:031423_0521_0FEC5F294C6E8690"/>
propoſitions for that purpoſe, and would carefully convey their applications to ſir William Howe or the general who might command the Britiſh army.—I take the liberty to return their letters, preſuming that Congreſs may incline to give them ſome anſwer, either directly, or through general Heath.</p>
                  <p>In reſpect to lieutenant-colonel * * *, I do not find that there is any neceſſity for granting the prayer of his petition: we have already too many officers; and I do not apprehend the intereſt of the ſtates would be much promoted in his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment. If he could make up two or three companies, they would be of priſoners and deſerters, who would moſt aſſuredly embrace an early opportunity to go off with their arms and clothing. I am diſpoſed to conſider him as a man of ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs and policy, as he is aiming at a confirmation in the line of the army (by obtaining an appointment to a new corps) of the rank which he had as a diviſion quarter-maſter. Beſides the impolicy of augmenting the number of our officers where it is not really eſſential, ſuch a promotion would give diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction; and I ſuppoſe there are few officers, if any, who for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly commanded Mr. * * * in the line of the army, that would ſubmit to his orders.</p>

                     </gap> will inform Congreſs of the fate of the continental frigates in Delaware,—a fate (in the ſituation they were left) I had long predicted, and which I had taken much pains to avert, by uſing every argument in my power to have them ſunk. In that caſe, their deſtruction would have been at leaſt a work of time, diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty and expenſe, and might have been perhaps prevented.—About one o'clock on thurſday I got notice of an intended move of the enemy by water; and, conjecturing the deſtination of it, had a detachment under general Maxwell (whoſe tour of duty it was) ready to march towards the Delaware by four o'clock: but a heavy rain prevented their moving till next morning.</p>
                  <p>I have been happy in the exchange, and a viſit from lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant-colonel Allen. His fortitude and firmneſs ſeem to have placed him out of the reach of misfortune. There is an origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſomething in him that commands admiration; and his long captivity and ſufferings have only ſerved to increaſe if poſſible his enthuſiaſtic zeal.—He appears very deſirous of rendering his ſervices to the ſtates, and of being employed, and at the ſame time does not diſcover any ambition for high rank.—Congreſs will herewith receive a letter from him; and I doubt
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:031423_0522_0FEC5FBC2B627DB8"/>
not they will make ſuch proviſion for him as they may think proper and ſuitable.</p>
                  <p>I take pleaſure in tranſmitting a Philadelphia paper of the ninth, which came to hand yeſterday evening, containing a meſſage from his moſt chriſtian majeſty to the court of London in conſequence of the treaty between him and theſe ſtates,—and his Britannic majeſty's addreſs to the lords and commons, &amp;c.—The meſſage is received in terms of irony and deriſion, more degrading to the pride and dignity of Britain than any thing ſhe has ever experienced ſince ſhe has been a nation. It is not an actual declaration of war, but it certainly muſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce one.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE been honored with your two favors of the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth and fifteenth inſtant, with the ſeveral papers alluded to, the former by monſieur Jemat, the latter by expreſs yeſterday. Colonel Johnſon ſet out on ſaturday afternoon to wait on Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs upon the ſubject of his appointment, and, I preſume, will be at York to-day.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall announce the reſolution of the fifteenth to the army, and would flatter myſelf it will quiet in a great meaſure the uneaſineſs which have been ſo extremely diſtreſſing, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent reſignations, which had proceeded, and were likely to be at ſuch a height, as to deſtroy our whole military ſyſtem. It has experienced no inconſiderable ſhock, particularly in the line of ſome ſtates, from the loſs of ſeveral very valuable offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers.</p>
                  <p>The letter and brevet for colonel Allen I will tranſmit by the firſt opportunity.—He left camp eight days ago.</p>
                  <p>From a variety of concurring circumſtances, and the uniform report of perſons who have left Philadelphia within four days paſt, it would appear that the enemy mean to evacuate the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It is ſaid they have already embarked a part of their heavy cannon and baggage,—that tranſports are fitted and fitting for their horſe, and taking in hay. The accounts further add that there has been a preſs for ſome nights in the city, and ſeveral men obtained in this way, and carried aboard ſhip; alſo that there has been an increaſed number of vendues. Theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb n="227" facs="unknown:031423_0523_0FEC5FA2718DE9C0"/>
all indicate an evacuation: but I have not been able to learn the objects of their future operations.—I wrote to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Gates yeſterday upon the ſubject, that he may be prepar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the beſt manner the ſituation of things will admit, in caſe they ſhould be deſtined for the North-river,—and deſired him to retain for the preſent all the eaſtern recruits intended for this army.</p>
                  <p>The quarter-maſter-general and commiſſary of proviſions are directed to uſe every poſſible exertion for putting the affairs of their departments in a train to facilitate a movement in caſe it ſhould be neceſſary. But ſuch have been the derangements and diſorders in them, that we muſt be greatly embarraſſed for a conſiderable time yet.</p>
                  <p>A valuable detachment, under the command of the marquis Fayette, marched this morning, which is intended to move be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Delaware and Schuylkill, for reſtraining the enemy's parties, procuring intelligence, and to act as circumſtance may require.</p>
                  <p>I cannot help feeling for the priſoners in poſſeſſion of the enemy. If they evacuate Philadelphia, thoſe unhappy men will be dragged away with them, and perhaps to a more miſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able confinement. But, ſuppoſing that their future treatment ſhould not be worſe, or even that it ſhould be more comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than their paſt,—the idea of being removed farther from their friends, and farther from relief, muſt diſtreſs them to the laſt degree.</p>

The impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy of ſuffering them ever to remain in places acceſſible to ſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, out of the queſtion,—our diſtreſs for both is amazingly great: we have many men now without firelocks, and many coming in, in the ſame predicament; and half the army are without ſhirts. Our condition, for want of the latter, and blankets, is quite painful—of the former, very diſtreſſing. The doctors attribute in a great degree the loſs of hundreds of lives by the ſcarcity of clothing; and I am certain hundreds have deſerted from the ſame cauſe.</p>

I did not know how far I might be authoriſed to comply with his requeſt, and therefore lay the matter before Congreſs. At the ſame time I would obſerve that nothing appears to me more equita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble than that claims of this ſort, where they are not immode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate, ſhould be ſatisfied by the public.—If this were not the caſe, the expenſes of an officer, when ordered from one poſt to another, eſpecially where they are diſtant, would ſink the whole or a very large part of his pay.—The charges attending the general's journey from hence to Pittſburg will require equal attention; and the whole, I am perſuaded, will meet with a juſt and ſuitable proviſion.</p>

                  <p>SINCE I had the honor of addreſſing you on the twenty-fourth inſtant, nothing material has happened. The enemy are ſtill in Philadelphia: but the intelligence from thence is ſo clear and ſo ſtrong, that it is certain, or nearly as much ſo as any event can be that is contingent, that they mean to abandon it. Againſt the various meaſures they are purſuing, which point to an evacuation, there is but one ſingle circumſtance op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed that I can learn, which is, that they are working at their redoubts with great induſtry. But this fact, though certainly true, cannot be of ſufficient weight to raiſe a doubt upon the ſubject, and muſt be conſidered as merely calculated to deceive us, and to maſk their deſign.</p>
                  <p>We cannot find out, notwithſtanding the moſt diligent pains, whether their movement will be by land or ſea; nor are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of the town ſatisfied on the point.—Appearances fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor either.—They have a great many ſhips, and very large: yet, from a preparation of boats at Prince's-bay on the ſouth ſide of Staten-Iſland which I am juſt adviſed of, and for ſome other reaſons, a land route is not improbable.</p>

I do not know whether any conſiderable quantity may be left: but it has been ſuggeſted; that, from an expectation of the ſort, there are ſome bringing into light their gold and ſilver for the purpoſe of buying-up.—If there ſhould be clothing ſuitable for the army, perhaps there might be nothing unjuſt in the public's taking the preference, and Congreſs appointing one or two intelligent active perſons of addreſs, acquainted with the city and with thoſe who have the goods, with proper powers to purchaſe them.</p>
                  <p>Whatever meaſure may be thought expedient, it will be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to adopt it as early as poſſible, as the evacuation will probably take place in a ſhort time.

                  <p>I have notified general Mifflin of the inquiry directed by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs on the eleventh inſtant, by tranſmitting him a copy of their proceedings; and he has obtained leave, on his ſolicitation, to repair to York, &amp;c. to prepare for his defence. This I thought myſelf under a neceſſity of granting, however inconvenient and injurious it may be to permit the abſence of officers at this pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod.</p>

                  <p>SINCE I had the honor of addreſſing you this forenoon, I received your letter of the ſeventeenth, with its ſeveral inclo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures.—I am happy in the approbation of Congreſs reſpecting my conduct to doctor Ferguſon. I could not find, after the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tureſt conſideration on the ſubject, that his paſſage through the country could be in any wiſe material, or anſwer any other pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe than to ſpread diſaffection.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall take every meaſure in my power to prevent an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between the army and the enemy, and alſo between the inhabitants and the latter. You may reſt aſſured that whatever letters come from their lines ſhall be, as they ever have been, minutely inſpected; and whenever they import any thing of an inſidious caſt, they ſhall be ſuppreſſed. In this I truſt I ſhall not offend againſt any rule of right, nor the ſtricteſt propriety.</p>
                  <p>The letter for the commiſſioners I ſhall tranſmit by the earlieſt opportunity: however, their departure from Philadelphia will prevent their getting it as ſoon as they otherwiſe would have done.—I cannot ſay that I regret the delay: for there is no knowing to what acts of depredation and ruin their diſappointed ambition might have led. And permit me to add that I think there was no other criterion for Congreſs to go by, than the one
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:031423_0531_0FEC5F21CD7A60E0"/>
they have adopted. The proceedings of the twenty-ſecond of April, it is probable, have reached, Britain by this time, and will ſhew that the preſent powers of the commiſſioners,—or at leaſt thoſe we are obliged to ſuppoſe them to poſſeſs,—are whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly incompatible to any valuable end.</p>
                  <p>I have appointed general Arnold to command in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, as the ſtate of his wound will not permit his ſervices in a more active line.

                  <p>THE baron Steuben will have the honor to deliver you this. I do not know particularly the extent of his buſineſs at York; but, from what he has communicated, it is in part to get the duties and powers of his appointment minutely defined and ſettled. I incloſe a copy of orders on the fifteenth inſtant, which were iſſued to quiet the minds of the general officers, and to remove a ſpirit of jealouſy which but too apparently was riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing among them. Theſe contain my ideas of the principal du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of the inſpector's office, and, I have reaſon to think, are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally agreeable to the army. While I am on this ſubject, I muſt do juſtice to the baron's intelligence, zeal, and indefatiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble induſtry, from which we have experienced very happy ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects.</p>
                  <p>The incloſed letter I tranſmit at the requeſt of captain Gibbs; and I wiſh to recommend him to the conſideration of Congreſs. He has been in the army from the commencement of the war, and in the capacities he mentions. When Congreſs were pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to honor me with the appointment of officers for the ſixteen additional batallions, I offered to make ſome proviſion for him; but this he declined, preferring to remain in my family. The guard he commanded originally conſiſted of fifty men: but, ſince the arrival of baron Steuben, it has been augmented to a hundred and fifty. He adviſed that there ſhould be a ſelect corps
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:031423_0532_0FEC602C003786D8"/>
of this number to receive the manoeuvres in the firſt inſtance, and to act as a model to the army; and propoſed that it ſhould be formed of the old guard company and draughts from the line.

The incloſed copy of a letter from our commiſſioners will ſhew that they are come to obtain the releaſe of Aſtiarix, another warrior, who was tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en on the frontiers of Virginia. I never heard of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance till I was informed of it a few days ago by a letter from general Schuyler. As the commiſſioners have conſented to his exchange, and adviſed it, I have aſſured them it was agreeable

to me; and I muſt take the liberty to requeſt that Congreſs will order it to be accompliſhed as ſoon as poſſible.</p>
                  <p>I have treated them with civility, but declared at the ſame time, in anſwer to their ſpeeches both in council and as warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ors,—if they do not immediately ceaſe hoſtilities, and become our friends, or at leaſt neutral,—that, the moment we are clear of the Britiſh army, I will turn our whole force againſt them and the other nations at war with us, and cut them off to a man. They ſaw the main body of our army to-day; which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, added to the evacuation of Philadelphia, and the preſents I wrote general Arnold to make them, with other inſtances of kindneſs, I truſt, will have a happy influence on the actions and diſpoſitions of their nation when they return.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE the honor to inform you that I am now in Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey, and that the troops are paſſing the river at Coryel's, and are moſtly over.—The lateſt intelligence I have had reſpecting the enemy was yeſterday from general Dickinſon. He ſays they were in the morning at Moreſtown and Mount-Holly; but that he had not been able to learn what route they would purſue from thence; nor was it eaſy to determine, as, from their ſituation, they might either proceed to South-Amboy, or by way of Brunſwic. We have been a good deal impeded in our march by rainy weather.—As ſoon as we have cleaned the arms, and can get matters in train, we propoſe moving towards Prince<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, in order to avail ourſelves of any favorable occaſions that may preſent themſelves, of attacking or annoying the enemy.</p>

                  <p>I WAS duly honored with your favor of the twentieth inſtant, with the report to which it referred, and truſt my ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation will apologiſe for my not anſwering it before.</p>
                  <p>I am now here with the main body of the army, and preſſing hard to come up with the enemy. They encamped yeſterday at Monmouth court-houſe, having almoſt the whole of their front, particularly their left wing, ſecured by a marſh and thick wood, and their rear by a difficult defile, from whence they moved very early this morning.—Our advance, from the rainy weather, and the intenſe heat when fair, (though theſe may have been equally diſadvantageous to them) has been greatly delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Several of our men have fallen ſick from theſe cauſes; and a few unfortunately have fainted, and died in a little time after.</p>
                  <p>We have a ſelect and ſtrong detachment more forward, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the command of major-general Lee, with orders to attack their rear if poſſible. Whether the detachment will be able to come up with it, is a matter of queſtion, eſpecially before they get into ſtrong grounds. Beſides this, Morgan, with his corps, and ſome bodies of militia, are on their flanks.</p>
                  <p>I cannot determine yet at what place they intend to embark. Some think they will puſh for Sandy-hook, whilſt others ſuppoſe they mean to go to Shoal-harbor. The latter opinion ſeems to be founded in the greater probability, as, from intelligence, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral veſſels and craft are lying off that place.</p>
                  <p>We have made a few priſoners; and they have loſt a good many men by deſertion. I cannot aſcertain their number, as they came in to our advanced parties, and puſhed immediately into the country. I think five or ſix hundred is the leaſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber that have come in, in the whole. They are chiefly fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigners.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE the honor to inform you, that, about ſeven o'clock yeſterday morning, both armies advanced on each other. About twelve, they met on the grounds near Monmouth court-houſe, when an action commenced. We forced the enemy from

the field, and encamped on the ground. They took a ſtrong poſt in our front, ſecured on both flanks by moraſſes and thick woods, where they remained all about twelve at night, and then retreated.—I cannot at this time go into a detail of matters: when opportunity will permit, I ſhall take the liberty of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Congreſs a more particular account of the proceedings of the day.</p>

                  <p>I EMBRACE the firſt moment of leiſure to give Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs a more full and particular account of the movements of the army under my command ſince its paſſing the Delaware, than the ſituation of our affairs would heretofore permit.</p>
                  <p>I had the honor to adviſe them; that, on the appearances of the enemy's intention to march through Jerſey becoming ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, I had detached general Maxwell's brigade in conjunction with the militia of that ſtate to interrupt and impede their pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs by every obſtruction in their power, ſo as to give time to the army under my command to come up with them, and take advantage of any favorable circumſtances that might preſent themſelves. The army having proceeded to Coryel's ferry, and croſſed the Delaware at that place, I immediately detached colonel Morgan with a ſelect corps of ſix hundred men to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force general Maxwell, and marched with the main body to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Princeton.</p>
                  <p>The flow advance of the enemy had greatly the air of deſign; and led me, with others, to ſuſpect that general Clinton, deſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous of a general action, was endeavouring to draw us down into the lower country, in order, by a rapid movement, to gain our right, and take poſſeſſion of the ſtrong grounds above us.—This conſideration, and to give the troops time to repoſe and refreſh themſelves from the fatigues they had experienced from rainy and exceſſive hot weather, determined me to halt at Hope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well townſhip, about five miles from Princeton, where we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained till the morning of the twenty fifth.</p>
                  <p>On the preceding day I made a ſecond detachment of fifteen hundred choſen troops under brigadier-general Scott, to rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force thoſe already in the vicinity of the enemy, the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually to annoy and delay their march. The next day the army moved to Kingſton; and, having received intelligence that the enemy were proſecuting their route towards Monmouth
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:031423_0536_0FEC604A404DCDF8"/>
court-houſe, I diſpatched a thouſand ſelect men under brigadier<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>general Wayne, and ſent the marquis De la Fayette to take the command of the whole advanced corps, including Maxwell's brigade and Morgan's light infantry, with orders to take the firſt fair opportunity of attacking the enemy's rear.</p>
                  <p>In the evening of the ſame day, the whole army marched from Kingſton, where our baggage was left, with intention to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a proper diſtance for ſupporting the advanced corps, and arrived at Cranberry early the next morning. The intenſe heat of the weather, and a heavy ſtorm unluckily coming on, made it impoſſible to reſume our march that day without great inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience and injury to the troops. Our advanced corps, being differently circumſtanced, moved from the poſition it had held the night before, and took poſt in the evening on the Monmouth road, about five miles from the enemy's rear, in expectation of attacking them next morning on their march.—The main body having remained at Cranberry, the advanced corps was found to be too remote, and too far upon the right, to be ſupported in caſe of an attack either upon or from the enemy; which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced me to ſend orders to the marquis to file off by his left towards Engliſhtown, which he accordingly executed early in the morning of the twenty-ſeventh.</p>
                  <p>The enemy, in marching from Allentown, had changed their diſpoſition, and placed their beſt troops in the rear, conſiſting of all the grenadiers, light infantry, and cha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ſeurs of the line.—This alteration made it neceſſary to increaſe the number of our advanced-corps; in conſequence of which I detached major-ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Lee with two brigades to join the marquis at Engliſhtown, on whom of courſe the command of the whole devolved, amount<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to about five thouſand men. The main body marched the ſame day, and encamped within three miles of that place. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan's corps was left hovering on the enemy's right flank; and the Jerſey militia, amounting at this time to about ſeven or eight hundred men, under general Dickinſon, on their left.</p>
                  <p>The enemy were now encamped in a ſtrong poſition, with their right extending about a mile and a half beyond the court-houſe in the parting of the roads leading to Shrewſbury and Middletown, and their left along the road from Allentown to Monmouth, about three miles on this ſide the court-houſe. Their right flank lay on the ſkirt of a ſmall wood, while their left was ſecured by a very thick one,—a moraſs running towards their rear, and their whole front covered by a wood, and, for a conſiderable extent towards the left, with a moraſs.—In this ſituation they halted till the morning of the twenty-eighth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="241" facs="unknown:031423_0537_0FEC5FCE38CEBD68"/>
Matters being thus ſituated,—and having had the beſt inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, that, if the enemy were once arrived at the heights of Middletown, ten or twelve miles from where they were, it would be impoſſible to attempt any thing againſt them with a proſpect of ſucceſs,—I determined to attack their rear the moment they ſhould get in motion from their preſent ground. I communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated my intention to general Lee, and ordered him to make his diſpoſition for the attack, and to keep his troops conſtantly lying upon their arms, to be in readineſs at the ſhorteſt notice. This was done with reſpect to the troops under my immediate command.</p>
                  <p>About five in the morning, general Dickinſon ſent an expreſs informing that the front of the enemy had begun their march. I inſtantly put the army in motion, and ſent orders by one of my aids to general Lee to move on and attack them unleſs there ſhould be very powerful reaſons to the contrary,—acquainting him at the ſame time, that I was marching to ſupport him, and, for doing it with the greater expedition and convenience, ſhould make the men diſencumber themſelves of their packs and blan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kets.</p>
                  <p>After marching about five miles, to my great ſurpriſe and mortification, I met the whole advanced corps retreating,—and, as I was told, by general Lee's orders,—without having made any oppoſition, except one fire, given by a party under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of colonel Butler, on their being charged by the enemy's cavalry, who were repulſed.—I proceeded immediately to the rear of the corps, which I found cloſely preſſed by the enemy, and gave directions for forming part of the retreating troops, who, by the brave and ſpirited conduct of the officers, aided by ſome pieces of well-ſerved artillery, checked the enemy's ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, and gave time to make a diſpoſition of the left wing and ſecond line of the army upon an eminence, and in a wood a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle in the rear, covered by a moraſs in front. On this were placed ſome batteries of cannon by lord Stirling who command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the left wing, which played upon the enemy with great ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, and, ſeconded by parties of infantry detached to oppoſe them, effectually put a ſtop to their advance.</p>
                  <p>General Lee being detached with the advanced corps, the command of the right wing, for the occaſion, was given to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Greene. For the expedition of the march, and to coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teract any attempt to turn our right, I had ordered him to file off by the new church, two miles from Engliſhtown, and fall into the Monmouth road, a ſmall diſtance in the rear of the court-houſe, while the reſt of the column moved directly on towards
<pb n="242" facs="unknown:031423_0538_0FEC5F83D26F5088"/>
the court-houſe. On intelligence of the retreat, he marched up and took a very advantageous poſition on the right.</p>
                  <p>The enemy, by this time, finding themſelves warmly oppoſed in front, made <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>n attempt to turn our left flank; but they were bravely repulſed and driven back by detached parties of infant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. They alſo made a movement to our right with as little ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs, general Greene having advanced a body of troops with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tillery to a commanding piece of ground; which not only diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed their deſign of turning our right, but ſeverely enfiladed thoſe in front of the left wing.—In addition to this, general Wayne advanced with a body of troops, and kept up ſo ſevere and well-directed a fire, that the enemy were ſoon compelled to retire behind the defile where the firſt ſtand in the beginning of the action had been made.</p>
                  <p>In this ſituation the enemy had both their flanks ſecured by thick woods and moraſſes, while their front could only be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached thro' a narrow paſs. I reſolved nevertheleſs to attack them; and, for that purpoſe, ordered general Poor, with his own and the Carolina brigade, to move round upon their right, and general Woodford upon their left, and the artillery to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> them in front. But the impediments in their way prevented their getting within reach before it was dark. They remained upon the ground they had been directed to occupy during the night, with intention to begin the attack early the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and the army continued lying upon their arms in the field of action, to be in readineſs to ſupport them.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time the enemy were employed in removing their wounded, and about twelve o'clock at night marched away in ſuch ſilence, that, though general Poor lay extremely near them, they effected their retreat without his knowledge. They carried off all their wounded, except four officers and about forty privates whoſe wounds were too dangerous to permit their removal.</p>
                  <p>The extreme heat of the weather, the fatigue of the men from their march through a deep ſandy country almoſt entirely deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of water, and the diſtance the enemy had gained by march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the night, made a purſuit impracticable and fruitleſs: it would have anſwered no valuable purpoſe, and would have been fatal to numbers of our men, ſeveral of whom died the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing day with heat.</p>
                  <p>Were I to conclude my account of this day's tranſactions without expreſſing my obligations to the officers of the army in general, I ſhould do injuſtice to their merit, and violence to my own feelings. They ſeemed to vie with each other in manifeſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

I cannot, however, forbear mentioning brigadier-general Wayne, whoſe good conduct and bravery through the whole action deſerves particular commendation.</p>
                  <p>The behaviour of the troops in general, after they recovered from the firſt ſurpriſe occaſioned by the retreat of the advanced corps, was ſuch as could not be ſurpaſſed.—All the artillery, both officers and men, that were engaged, diſtinguiſhed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in a remarkable manner.</p>
                  <p>Incloſed, Congreſs will be pleaſed to receive a return of our killed, wounded, and miſſing. Among the firſt were lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenant colonel Bunner of Pennſylvania, and major Dickinſon of Virginia, both officers of diſtinguiſhed merit, and much to be regretted.—The enemy's ſlain, left on the field, and buried by us, according to the return of the perſons aſſigned to that duty, were four officers and two hundred and forty-five privates. In the former number was the honorable colonel Monckton. Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of theſe, they buried ſome themſelves, as there were ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral new graves near the field of battle.—How many men they may have had wounded, cannot be determined: but, from the uſual proportion, the number muſt have been conſiderable.—There were a few priſon<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>rs taken.</p>
                  <p>The peculiar ſituation of general Lee at this time requires that I ſhould ſay nothing of his conduct. He is now in arreſt.

                  <p>Being fully convinced by the gentlemen of this country that the enemy cannot be hurt or injured in their embarkation at Sandy-Hook, the place to which they are going,—and unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to get too far removed from the North-river,—I put the troops in motion early this morning, and ſhall proceed that way, leaving the Jerſey brigade, Morgan's corps, and other light parties (the militia being all diſmiſſed), to hover about them, to countenance deſertion, and to prevent their depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as far as poſſible.—After they embark, the former will take poſt in the neighborhood of Elizabethtown, the latter re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join the corps from which they were detached.</p>

                  <p>The left wing of the army, which advanced yeſterday four miles beyond this, moved this morning on the route towards King's ferry. The right, and ſecond line, which makes the laſt diviſion, are now here, where they will halt for a day or

two,—or perhaps longer, if no circumſtances of a preſſing nature caſt up,—in order to refreſh themſelves from the great fatigues they have ſuffered from the intenſe heat of the weather.</p>
                  <p>We have had it reported for two or three days through ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral channels from New-York, that there is a French fleet on the coaſt: and it is added that the enemy have been manning with the utmoſt diſpatch ſeveral of their ſhips of war which were there, and have puſhed them out to ſea.—How far theſe facts are true, I cannot determine: but I ſhould think it of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite importance to aſcertain the firſt, if poſſible, by ſending out ſwift-ſailing cruiſers. The moſt intereſting advantages might follow the information.—I will try, by every practicable m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I HAD the honor yeſterday evening of receiving your very important favor of the tenth inſtant.—Colonel Laurens, one of my aids, will ſet out this morning with a letter to the French admiral, the count D'Eſtaing, incloſing a copy of yours and ſuch other information as I have been able to collect. Its further purpoſe is for the eſtabliſhing a convention of ſignals in caſe of co-operation, or to convey him ſuch knowledge of the enemy's naval force and poſition, as may from time to time come under our cogniſance.</p>
                  <p>It appears by intelligence of to-day that the count D'Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taing is off or near Sandy-Hook, having already ſeized ſeveral fiſhing boats on the banks, in order to procure information and pilots.</p>
                  <p>The army is in motion, and will croſs the North-river with all convenient diſpatch, where I ſhall purſue ſuch meaſures as may appear beſt calculated for improving the preſent conjunc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</p>

                  <p>SINCE I had the honor of addreſſing you on the four<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth I have been favored with your letters of the eleventh
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:031423_0542_0FEC60602A09CF70"/>
and ſeventeenth, with their reſpective incloſures. The next morning after the receipt of the former which came to hand on the ſeventeenth, I diſpatched lieutenant colonel Hamilton, ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of my aids, with the beſt pilots and the moſt ſkilful ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of ſhips I could procure, to admiral count D'Eſtaing, to converſe with him more fully on the ſubject of his opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, than I was able to direct lieutenant-colonel Laurens to do for want of the information which I afterwards obtained from major Chouin, and a knowledge in ſeveral other points beſides.</p>
                  <p>On ſunday night Mr. Laurens returned; and I found by him that it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> the count's firſt wiſh to enter at Sandy-Hook, in order to poſſeſs himſelf of, or to deſtroy if poſſible, the whole of the Britiſh fleet lying in the bay of New-York; and that, for this purpoſe, he had been much engaged in his inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries about the depth of water, and in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ounding the channel to aſcertain it; the reſult of which was, that the water, from the experiments made, was too ſhallow at the entrance to admit his large ſhips,—or, if they could be got in, it appeared that it would not be without a great deal of difficulty and riſk. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter this diſappointment, the next important object which ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to preſent itſelf was an attempt againſt Rhode-Iſland, which the count inclined to make (unleſs I ſhould adviſe the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) as ſoon as the Chimère frigate, which had carried his excellency monſieur Girard into the Delaware, ſhould rejoin him.</p>
                  <p>Lieutenant-colonel Hamilton, who was well informed of our ſituation and of my ſentiments on every point, was inſtructed to give the admiral a full and accurate ſtate of facts, and to acquaint him what aid, and how far we could co-operate with him in caſe of an attempt either againſt New-York or Rhode-Iſland; and alſo to obtain his ideas of the plan and ſyſtem which he might think ought to be purſued, and to agree with him on certain ſignals.</p>
                  <p>Previous to my diſpatching Mr. Hamilton, from the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation I received on my enquiries reſpecting the navigation at the Hook, I was led to ſuſpect (however intereſting and deſirable the deſtruction or capture of the Britiſh fleet might be) that it was not ſufficient to introduce the count's ſhips. Under this apprehenſion, I wrote general Sullivan on the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteenth by expreſs, that an expedition might take place in a ſhort time againſt Rhode-Iſland, and urged him at the ſame, time to apply to the ſtates of Maſſachuſetts, Rhode-Iſland and Connecticut, for as many men as would augment his force
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:031423_0543_0FEC5FD12B1A0308"/>
to five thouſand, and alſo to make every poſſible preparation of boaſt; proviſion, pilots, &amp;c. as if the event was fixed and certain.</p>
                  <p>From this time till about twelve o'clock on ſunday, the troops continued paſſing the river, when I croſſed with the laſt diviſion. On monday afternoon I arrived at this place, in the neighborhood of which, the right and left wing encamped that night, with the ſecond line a few miles in their rear. And here I am happy to add that their paſſage acroſs the river was effected without any accident, or without any more delay than neceſſarily attended the work.</p>
                  <p>Being perſuaded now from the converſation which I have had with ſeveral pilots and maſters of veſſels, of character, as well as from the accounts of other gentlemen, and colonel Laurens's report on his return, that the paſſing of the count's ſhips by the Hook would be extremely precarious, if not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable,—I determined yeſterday (which was as ſoon as it could be done), without waiting for further intelligence upon the ſubject, to put two brigades under marching orders. They accordingly marched this morning at two o'clock, for Rhode-Iſland, under the particular command of generals Varnum and Glover reſpectively, and both under the direction, for the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent, of the marquis De la Fayette. A water conveyance was thought of, and wiſhed for the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>aſe of the troops: but, on con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration of all circumſtances, ſuch as the difficulty of provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing veſſels, the change and precarlouſneſs of the winds, the riſk from the enemy's ſhips, &amp;c. their route by land was deemed by far the more eligible.—The force with general Sullivan, from the beſt and lateſt advice I have been able to obtain, is about three thouſand.—A detachment under colonel Jackſon will follow Varnum's and Glover's brigades.</p>
                  <p>The incloſed papers, No. 1, reſpecting eight perſons ſent from Bennington, and ordered into the enemy's lines, came to hand yeſterday. About the ſame time I received a letter from governor Clinton, containing a petition by the priſoners, and a letter from the committee of Albany, all remonſtrating againſt the proceeding. As this is a matter in which I have no autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity to act, nor in which I would wiſh to intermeddle, I take the liberty of referring it to Congreſs that they may decide up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it.—The priſoners are at Weſt-Point, and ordered to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained there for the preſent.</p>
                  <p>I would alſo take the liberty of tranſmitting to Congreſs a letter from captain Gibbs, and of recommending him to their conſideration. His letter was to have been ſent by the baron
<pb n="248" facs="unknown:031423_0544_0FEC6065CC579F48"/>
Steuben before we marched from Valley-Forge: but his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to go to Yorktown at that time, and our move through the Jerſeys, delayed its being done. The captain has been in the army from the commencement of the war, and in the capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cities which he mentions.—When Congreſs were pleaſed to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor me with the appointment of officers for the ſixteen addition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al battalions, I offered to make ſome proviſion for him: but this he declined, preferring to remain in my family. The guard he originally commanded conſiſted of fifty men; but, ſince the arrival of baron Steuben, it has been augmented to a hundred and fifty. The baron adviſed that there ſhould be a ſelect corps of this number, to receive the manoeuvres in the firſt inſtance, and to act as a model to the army; and propoſed that it ſhould be formed of the old guard company, and draughts from the line.—I preſume, if it ſhould be Congreſs's pleaſure, a majority would be highly acceptable to the captain, and that it is as much as he expects.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eleven o'clock, P. M.</hi>—I this moment received a letter from colonel Hamilton, who is on his return to the army, dated the twentieth at Black-point. He informs that the count D'Eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing would ſail the next evening for Rhode-Iſland, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced from actual ſoundings that he could not enter his ſhips. He was anxiouſly waiting the arrival of the Chimère, but, at all events, meant to ſail at the time he mentions. The admiral has agreed on ſignals with Mr. Hamilton.—Immediately after this letter came to hand, my aid, Mr. Laurens, ſet out for Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, having many things to communicate to general Sullivan upon the ſubject of his co-operation, which neither time nor propriety would ſuffer me to commit to paper. General Sulli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>van is directed not to confine the number of his troops to five thouſand, but to augment it, if he ſhall judge it neceſſary to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure his ſucceſs.</p>
                  <p>I was informed by Mr. Laurens, that the count D'Eſtaing's magazine of bread is not ſo large as he could wiſh, and that in the courſe of a few weeks he ſhall be in want. This circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I thought it right to mention: and I ſhould ſuppoſe that any quantity of biſcuit may be provided in a little time at Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia.</p>
                  <p>The incloſures, No. 2, are copies of three letters from myſelf to the admiral.—I flatter myſelf that the preſent of ſtock which I directed for him on his firſt arrival, in behalf of the ſtates, will be approved by Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>The accounts from the weſtern frontiers of Tryon county are diſtreſſing. The ſpirit of the ſavages ſeems to be rouſed, and
<pb n="249" facs="unknown:031423_0545_0FEC5FD99E124DA0"/>
they appear determined on miſchief and havoc in every quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.—By a letter from governor Clinton, of the twenty-firſt, they have deſtroyed Springfield and Andreas town, and are marching towards the ſettlements on the weſt branch of the Delaware. Theſe incurſions are extremely embarraſſing to our other affairs, and I think, will juſtify a concluſion that ſir Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Clinton's intention was to operate up the North-river.—Whether it may have changed with circumſtances cannot be determined.</p>
                  <p>I have detached the fourth Pennſylvania regiment and the remains of Morgan's corps, under lieutenant-colonel Butler, and alſo colonel Graham with a York ſtate regiment, to co-operate with the militia, and to check the Indians, if poſſible. Colonel Butler is an enterpriſing good officer, and well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the ſavage mode of warfare: and I am perſuaded whatever comes within the compaſs of his force and abilities, will be done.</p>

                  <p>THE baron De Steuben will have the honor of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing you this. I am extremely ſorry that this gentleman's ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and views ſeem to have determined him to quit the ſervice, in which he has been heretofore and is capable ſtill of being extenſively uſeful. Some diſcontents, which aroſe among the officers on account of the powers with which the office was at firſt veſted, induced me to arrange the duties of it upon a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> different from that on which it began. The moving ſtate of the army has for ſome time paſt, in a great degree, ſuſpended the exerciſe of the inſpectorate. When the troops marched from Brunſwic, the ſcarcity of general officers,—moſt of them being engaged with the court-martial either as members or witneſſes,—occaſioned my giving the baron a temporary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of a diviſion during the march. On our arrival near our preſent encampment, I intended he ſhould relinquiſh this charge, and reſume his former office, for which purpoſe a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral order was accordingly iſſued. But I find that he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely diſinclined to the meaſure, and reſolves not to continue in the ſervice unleſs he can hold an actual command in the line.</p>
                  <p>Juſtice concurring with inclination conſtrains me to teſtify that the baron has in every inſtance diſcharged the ſeveral
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:031423_0546_0FEC603179389EE0"/>
truſts repoſed in him with great zeal and ability, ſo as to give him the fulleſt title to my eſteem, as a brave, indefatigable, judicious, and experienced officer.—I regret there ſhould be a neceſſity that his ſervices ſhould be loſt to the army: at the ſame time I think it my duty explicitly to obſerve to Congreſs, that his deſire of having an actual and permanent command in the line cannot be complied with, without wounding the feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of a number of officers whoſe rank and merits give them every claim to attention; and that the doing it would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive of much diſſatisfaction and extenſive ill conſequences. This does not proceed from any perſonal objections on the part of thoſe officers againſt the baron:—on the contrary, moſt of them, whom I have heard ſpeak of him, expreſs a high ſenſe of his military worth. It proceeds from motives of another na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, which are too obvious to need particular explanation, or may be ſummed up in this, that they conceive ſuch a ſtep would be injurious to their eſſential rights and juſt expectations.—That this would be their way of thinking upon the ſubject, I am fully convinced, from the effect which the temporary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand given him, even under circumſtances ſo peculiar as thoſe I have mentioned, produced:—the ſtrongeſt ſymptoms of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>content appeared upon the occaſion.</p>

                  <p>I DO myſelf the honor of tranſmitting to Congreſs a co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py of a letter from general Knox, and of ſundry obſervations and remarks on the ordnance eſtabliſhment of the eleventh of February, which I received about the time we marched from
<pb n="251" facs="unknown:031423_0547_0FEC60332E8F72E8"/>
Valley-Forge. Theſe would have been tranſmitted before, had it not been for the moving ſtate of the army, and a variety of other objects which engroſſed my attention.—We have found by experience that ſome inconveniences have reſulted from the eſtabliſhment, which I conceive have proceeded principally from the total independence of the commiſſary-general of mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſtores on the commanding officer of artillery. It ſeems ſome alterations are neceſſary: and what they ſhall be, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs will be pleaſed to determine.</p>
                  <p>It is not without reluctance that I am conſtrained to renew my importunities on the ſubject of the committee of arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The preſent unſettled ſtate of the army is productive of ſo much diſſatisfaction and confuſion, and of ſuch a variety of diſputes, that almoſt the whole of my time is now employed in finding temporary and inadequate expedients to quiet the minds of the officers, and keep buſineſs on a tolerable ſort of footing. Not an hour paſſes without new applications and new com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints about rank: and, for want of a proper adjuſtment of this and many other eſſential points, our affairs are in a moſt irkſome and injurious train. We can ſcarcely form a court-martial or parade a detachment in any inſtance, without a warm diſcuſſion on the ſubject of precedence; and there are ſeveral good officers now who are forced to decline duty, to prevent diſputes, and their being commanded by others who upon eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry principle are their inferiors, unleſs their having obtained commiſſions before them (from the opportunities they had of making earlier applications, from local circumſtances) ſhould be conſidered ſufficient to give them a ſuperior claim.—There are many other cauſes of diſſatisfaction on this head: but I will not enter into a minute relation of them. I ſincerely wiſh that the gentlemen appointed, or ſuch others as Congreſs may think proper to nominate for the occaſion, would immediately repair to camp:—the preſent opportunity is favorable for reducing matters to ſyſtem and order; and, from painful experience, I know there is an abſolute neceſſity for it.</p>
                  <p>I ſhould alſo hope that Congreſs will excuſe me for mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing again the neceſſity there is for appointing ſome brigadiers. The Maſſachuſetts, by the reſignation of general Learned, wants one: Pennſylvania, as general Hand is not here, has but one with the army: Maryland, which has two large brigades in the field, has only general Smallwood; and the North-Caro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lina troops, ſince the departure of general M'Intoſh, have been without any.—As I had taken the liberty upon a former occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to offer my ſentiments to Congreſs and their committee
<pb n="252" facs="unknown:031423_0548_0FEC6037DE5D6830"/>
upon this ſubject, I ſhould not trouble them now, if I was not more and more convinced that the ſervice required promotions in this line. The frequent changes which take place among the officers, where there are no brigadiers, are attended with great inconvenience and detriment; and they are an effectual bar to the introduction of diſcipline. In ſuch caſes, the officers know that their command is but temporary, always liable to ceaſe; and therefore they do not find themſelves ſufficiently intereſted to promote order and ſubordination; nor will the reſt look up to them with that reſpect and deference which are eſſential. Every day's experience proves this, and ſhews be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond queſtion that the affairs of a brigade can never be in a right train without a brigadier or ſome general officer to direct them.—It is certain theſe appointments, at the firſt view, will add a little to the liſt of expenſe: but in the end they will be a great ſaving, and produce many important advantages.—We are alſo a good deal diſtreſſed at this time for major-generals. However, as this ariſes more from the peculiar circumſtances and ſituation of many which prevent them from duty in the line, than from a deficiency in the number appointed, I ſhall not add upon the occaſion.</p>
                  <p>There is another branch of the army, which, in my opinion, calls loudly for the appointment of a general officer, and this is the cavalry.—For want of a proper regulating head in this corps, the whole has been in confuſion, and of but very little ſervice; whereas, under a right management, it might be moſt uſeful. The principal officers in it do not harmoniſe; which circumſtance, with their diſputes about rank, would (were there no other objections) effectually prevent the corps from rendering the public the ſervices they have a right to expect, and of which it ſhould be capable. To promote any gentleman now in it to a general command, would not be acquieſced in by the reſt,—nor do I know that any of them wiſh it;—and it would increaſe their miſunderſtanding, and, of courſe, diſorder.</p>
                  <p>I mean to draw all the horſe immediately together, when I truſt they will be under the direction of a general officer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed by Congreſs for the purpoſe. Who he ſhall be, will remain ſolely with them to determine. However, I will take the liberty to add that he ſhould be intelligent, active, atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; and, as far as I can judge, general Cadwallader or gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Reed would fill the poſt with great-honor and advantage; though it would ſeem, from the ſeat the latter has taken in Congreſs, and from his late appointment to the council of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania, as if he had declined every military view. The abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lities
<pb n="253" facs="unknown:031423_0549_0FEC5FDB30DEA690"/>
of theſe gentlemen, as well as their attachment, are ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally known; and I am led to believe that either would be as acceptable to the corps as any perſon that can be found. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed I have learned as much from two of the colonels.</p>
                  <p>I have been waiting with the moſt impatient anxiety to hear of count D'Eſtaing's arrival at Rhode-Iſland; but as yet I have not been ſo happy. My laſt intelligence from thence is a let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter from general Sullivan, dated at ten o'clock in the forenoon of the twenty-ſeventh, when he had no advice of the fleet.—He was in high ſpirits; and, from the preparation in which matters were, he entertained the moſt flattering hopes of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs in the intended enterpriſe.—The brigades of Varnum and Glover, with Jackſon's detachment, would arrive, I expect, on the ſecond inſtant.</p>
                  <p>As the army was encamped, and there was no great proſpect of a ſudden removal, I judged it adviſable to ſend general Greene to the eaſtward on wedneſday laſt, being fully perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his ſervices, as well in the quarter-maſter line as in the field, would be of material importance in the expedition againſt the enemy in that quarter. He is intimately acquainted with the whole of that country, and beſides he has an extenſive intereſt and influence in it. And, in juſtice to general Greene, I take occaſion to obſerve that the public is much indebted to him for his judicious manage<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ent and active exertions in his preſent department. When he entered upon it, he found it in a moſt confuſed, diſtracted, and deſtitute ſtate. This, by his conduct and induſtry, has undergone a very happy change, and ſuch as enabled us with great facility to make a ſudden move with the whole army and baggage from Valley-Forge in purſuit of the enemy, and to perform a march to this place. In a word, he has given the moſt general ſatisfaction, and his affairs carry much the face of method and ſyſtem.—I alſo conſider it as an act of juſtice to ſpeak of the conduct of colonel Wadſworth, commiſſary-general. He has been indefatigable in his exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to provide for the army; and, ſince his appointment, our ſupplies of proviſion have been good and ample.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Auguſt</hi> 4.—At ſeven o'clock in the evening yeſterday, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the incloſed letter from general Sullivan, with one ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to myſelf, a copy of which I do myſelf the pleaſure of forwarding.—I am exceedingly happy in the count's arrival, and that things wear ſo pleaſing an aſpect.</p>
                  <p>There is another ſubject on which I muſt take the liberty of addreſſing Congreſs, which is that of the clothier's department. I am perfectly ſatisfied, that, unleſs this very important and
<pb n="254" facs="unknown:031423_0550_0FEC606986CE9978"/>
intereſting office is put under better regulations, the army will never be clothed. * * * I believe both officers and men, particularly the latter, have ſuffered greater inconveniences and diſtreſſes than ſoldiers ever did before, for want of clothing; and that this has not flowed more from a real ſcarcity of arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, than a want of proper exertions and provident manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to procure them.—It is eſſential that ſomething ſhould be done, and immediately, to place the department on a better footing. We have now a great many men entirely deſtitute of ſhirts and breeches, and I ſuppoſe not leſs than a fourth or fifth of the whole here who are without ſhoes. From the deficien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies in this line, numbers of deſertions have proceeded,—not to mention deaths; and, what is ſtill worſe, the troops which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, and ſee themſelves in rags, want that ſpirit and pride ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to conſtitute the ſoldier.</p>
                  <p>I have been informed by ſeveral officers, and by ſuch as I can depend on, that many of the late draughts are willing and deſirous of enliſting during the war. I do not conceive myſelf at liberty to give direction on the point, and therefore ſubmit it to Congreſs to decide. However, if they can be engaged for the uſual bounties allowed by the continent, after proper pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cautions are taken to prevent fraud, I think the meaſure will be expedient.—It is true, our affairs have an agreeable aſpect at preſent: but the war may continue, and we—want men. A third of the time of ſome of them, and a half in the caſe of others, is already expired; and, as they will riſe in their views, and become more difficult in proportion as their ſervice draws to a concluſion,—if the ſtep is conſidered adviſable, the ſooner we attempt to enliſt, the better in all probability will the work ſucceed.</p>

                  <p>MR. Fuhrer and Mr. Kleinſmit
 have lately left the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh lines, and come in to us.—The account they give of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves is this, that they had been firſt lieutenants in the Heſſian corps, were taken priſoners at Trenton, reſided during their captivity at Dumfries in Virginia, were lately exchanged, and have ſince reſigned their commiſſions:—that having ſolicited per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to come out from the enemy, and refuſed, they deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to leave them at all hazards, and have now put their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign in execution.—The circumſtances of their captivity are known to ſeveral officers in our army.</p>
                  <p>They are deſirous of entering into our ſervice, obſerving that there are a number of German officers in the ſame diſpoſition with themſelves, who will reſign and join us, if they find that theſe meet with proper countenance.—It appears to me that important advantages may attend the encouraging a diſpoſition of this nature (if it really exiſts,—which is far from being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible) from the influence it will neceſſarily have upon the ſoldiery by increaſing that ſpirit of deſertion and diſcontent which already prevails among them.</p>

                     <pb n="257" facs="unknown:031423_0553_0FEC5FDD1BADF3E8"/>
Congreſs will beſt judge of the propriety of employing theſe gentlemen.—I have been thinking in what manner it might be done; and the mode leaſt exceptionable, which at preſent oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs to me, is to authoriſe them to raiſe a corps for themſelves, by enliſting ſuch German inhabitants, and ſuch deſerters from the foreign troops, as may be willing to engage. The corps at firſt, as it is only by way of experiment, need not be large, but may be afterwards increaſed as circumſtances ſhall point out. This meaſure, I apprehend, cannot be attended with any material in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, and may be productive of utility. If the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men are employed at all, it muſt be in a new corps, as they could not be introduced into any of thoſe already formed, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out injuring the officers in them, and producing diſſatisfaction, murmurs, and reſignations.</p>
                  <p>I have founded them on the plan here ſuggeſted, and they ſeem to be very ſanguine in its ſucceſs, and anxious to undertake it.—They expect ſome augmentation in rank; and indeed it ſeems neceſſary, in order the more effectually to intereſt others to follow their example: but caution ſhould be uſed not to car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry the idea too far; becauſe, beſides other weighty conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the higher the rank conferred on them, the more difficult it will be to provide for thoſe who may hereafter come to us, and who will of courſe frame their expectations by compariſon.</p>

                  <p>YOUR favor of the ſixteenth, with the ſeveral papers to which it referred, came duly to hand on wedneſday afternoon.</p>

                  <p>I DO myſelf the honor of tranſmitting to Congreſs the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed memorial of colonel Rawlings, preſented in behalf of himſelf and the Maryland officers who were under his command in the year 1776. The facts which are ſtated in it are gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally true; and I cannot but feel myſelf exceedingly intereſted in favor of theſe gentlemen. The conduct of this whole corps, when Fort-Waſhington was attacked, is ſo generally known and approved, that it is almoſt unneceſſary to add upon the ſubject. However I think it but juſtice to obſerve that every repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of that day's tranſaction gave them the higheſt credit.—They fought with a degree of veteran bravery; and, though but a handful, they maintained their ground a conſiderable time, notwithſtanding the moſt vigorous efforts to force them. All who were ſpectators upon the occaſion have declared this; and the enemy themſelves have not refuſed them applauſe.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems hard that officers of their merit ſhould be overlook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,—and a loſs to the ſervice that they ſhould remain unem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed: but the conſequences that would attend their incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration with any of the corps now exiſting appear too diſagree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, to try the experiment. Colonel Rawlings himſelf, from the information I have had, does not incline to give any uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the line of the army, and would rather make a diſtant part of it againſt the Indians, in caſe he could be provided for in that way. Captain Beall, who is charged with this, will be able to inform Congreſs more fully than I can of the wiſhes of
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:031423_0556_0FEC606DA358D018"/>
the colonel and the reſt of his officers; and his account may lead perhaps to ſome ſuitable and practicable proviſion for them. As I have obſerved before, they are men who deſerve well of their country.—I only mention the Maryland officers upon this occaſion, becauſe that part of the corps which came from Virgi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nia was provided for by the ſtate in their preſent arrangement, as I have been credibly adviſed.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Rawlings was never in the complete and actual command of the regiment under his direction as colonel, becauſe he never obtained a commiſſion: but he became entitled to it according to the then common rule of promotion by the death of colonel Stephenſon, and the non-acceptance of colonel Morgan who was appointed to it. Of the latter circumſtance Mr. Rawlings, I am perſuaded, was never appriſed, as it was kept a ſecret from an apprehenſion that the enemy might claim an officer of the rank of colonel in exchange for Morgan who was then a priſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on parole, if his promotion came to their knowledge.—Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jor Williams of the Maryland part of the corps was appointed by the ſtate to one of her regiments now in the field, and is the only officer in his predicament I know of, that they arranged.</p>

                  <p>I WOULD take the liberty to inform Congreſs that colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel Armand is come to camp with his corps, and has applied to me for commiſſions for his officers.—By the reſolution for eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing the corps, it was to be officered out of the foreigners then commiſſioned in our ſervice, who were not nor could be provided for in any of the regiments. Inſtead of this, there are only three officers in the corps who before held any com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions in our ſervice, <abbr>viz.</abbr> lieutenant-colonel Vrigney, and captains Mercley and Shafner. The two laſt were only lieu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenants, and are now appointed to captaincies, contrary (it ſeems to me) to the ſpirit and intention of the reſolution.</p>
                  <p>As colonel Armand has departed from his inſtructions which muſt govern me, I am not authoriſed to grant the commiſſions he requires, and am therefore under the neceſſity of troubling Congreſs with the arrangement of the corps, No. 1, as it now actually ſtands for their conſideration and deciſion.—The colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel founds his deviation from the reſolve upon ſome verbal in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timation
<pb n="262" facs="unknown:031423_0558_0FEC606FD4A18E20"/>
given him that the part in queſtion would not be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſted on.</p>
                  <p>I would alſo take the liberty to mention that general Du Portail lately delivered me a memorial, in which, among other things, he repreſents that he had made an agreement with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs at his firſt appointment, that neither himſelf nor the other gentlemen with him ſhould be commanded by any of the engi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neers who had preceded them in our army.—I could not but anſwer that the commiſſions of officers were the only rule of precedency and command I had to judge by; and, while others held ſuperior appointments, I muſt conſider them accordingly in the courſe of ſervice. He gave me the incloſed letter to you upon the ſubject, and is extremely anxious to have the matter placed upon a certain footing: and, no doubt, it will be for the good and tranquility of the ſervice that the claim be determined as ſpeedily as poſſible one way or the other. At the ſame time I think it right to obſerve that it cannot be expected that colonel Coſciuſko, who has been a good while in this line, and conducted himſelf with reputation and ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, will conſent to act in a ſubordinate capacity to any of the French gentlemen except general Du Portail. * * *</p>
                  <p>Since I had the honor of writing you on the twenty-fifth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, I have not received a ſingle line from general Sullivan. The only intelligence I have from the eaſtward is from mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſieur Pontjobean. This gentlemen left Rhode-Iſland the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſeventh, and arrived about two hours ago in camp. From him I learn that our people were ſtill on the iſland;—that it was generally thought they had made effectual proviſion for a retreat in caſe of exigency;—that in the evening of that day he met monſieur Preville, an officer belonging to the Langue<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doc, at Providence, going with diſpatches to general Sullivan,—who informed him that the French fleet had got into Boſton.—He further adds that monſieur Ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>oune who was in company with him at Providence, and who had more converſation with monſieur Preville than he himſelf had, told him that monſieur Preville ſaid count D'Eſtaing had ſailed or was on the point of ſailing again for Rhode-Iſland with ten ſhips of the line and his frigates.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE been duly honored with your favor of the twenty-eighth and that of the thirtieth ultimo, with the ſeveral incloſures to which they refer.</p>
                  <p>Congreſs may rely that I will uſe every poſſible means in my power to conciliate any differences that may have ariſen in conſequence of the count D'Eſtaing's going to Boſton, and to prevent a publication of the proteſt upon the occaſion.—Seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral days before the receipt of the reſolution, I had written to the eaſtward, urging the neceſſity of harmony, and the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency of affording the admiral every aſſiſtance to refit his ſhips. This I repeated after the reſolution came to hand; and I have alſo taken opportunity to requeſt all the general officers here to place the matter in the moſt favorable point of view whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver they hear it mentioned.</p>
                  <p>The five hundred guineas, which Congreſs were pleaſed to order, came ſafe to hand, and ſhall be appropriated to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes they intended, and as the exigency of the ſervice may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.—For want of ſupplies of this ſort, we have been very deficient in intelligence in many important and intereſting points. In ſome caſes, no conſideration in paper money has been found ſufficient to effect even an engagement to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure it: and, where it has been otherwiſe, the terms of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, on account of the depreciation, have been high, if not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orbitant.</p>
                  <p>The deſign of the enemy, as to their future movements, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main yet entirely [<hi>in the dark</hi>]: but the expectation of their leaving the continent is daily decreaſing. The hurricane ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſeems oppoſed to their going to the Weſt-Indies; and the paſſage to Europe in a little time will become more and more dangerous. Beſides theſe, there is another circumſtance, of
<pb n="264" facs="unknown:031423_0560_0FEC6047F6693AD0"/>
ſome weight, if true, to induce a belief that they mean to ſtay. It appears by the papers that part of the regiments lately raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in Britain are ordered to Halifax. If the troops here were intended to be recalled, it would ſeem that ſome of them would be ſent to reinforce that gar<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>iſon ſooner than troops from Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land or Scotland; and hence I think it may be preſumed that another campaign will take place in America, eſpecially if ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration are diſappointed in their expectations from the commiſſion.</p>
                  <p>Where the theatre of war may be, muſt be a matter of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture. But, as it is an acknowledged fact that an army act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the eaſtern ſtates muſt derive flour for its ſupport from thoſe more weſtern, I ſubmit to Congreſs the expediency, and, in my opinion, the neceſſity, of eſtabliſhing, without loſs of time, magazines of this article at convenient places (removed from the Sound) in Connecticut and Maſſachuſetts. I am the more induced to wiſh an early conſideration of this point, as, by a ſudden move of the army, (ſhould events make it neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry) the departments of commiſſary and quarter-maſter would be greatly diſtreſſed. Nor would ſuch magazines, I ſhould imagine, be attended with any conſiderable loſs, though the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my ſhould not operate in that quarter, as the flour would an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer occaſionally for our ſhipping, and the ſurplus might in all probability be otherwiſe readily diſpoſed of.</p>
                  <p>I take the liberty of tranſmitting to Congreſs a memorial I received from the reverend Mr. Tetard.—From the certificates annexed to it, he appears to be a man of great merit; and from every account, he has ſuffered in the extreme in the preſent conteſt. His attachment, ſervices, and misfortunes, ſeem to give him a claim to a generous notice: but, according to the new eſtabliſhment of the army, it is not in my power to make any proviſion for him. I therefore recommend his caſe to the attention and conſideration of Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Six o'clock, P. M.</hi>—I this minute received a letter from general Sullivan, of which the incloſure, No. 2, is a copy. I ſhall be exceedingly happy if a perfect reconciliation has taken place between him and the count and all the officers.—His letter will ſhew ſome of the reaſons that led to the proteſt, and that it was the hope of our officers that it would have operated as a juſtification to the admiral, to return againſt the ſentiments of his council, eſpecially as it coincided (as it is ſaid) with his own inclination.—I had theſe reaſons from another hand when the proteſt firſt came.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="265" facs="unknown:031423_0561_0FEC5FE6CA36E228"/>
                     <hi>September</hi> 5.—I was duly honored yeſterday evening with your favor of the thirty-firſt ultimo.—Though it is not expreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the reſolution of that date that any other bounty is to be given to the men who engage for three years or during the war, than twenty dollars, I ſhall take it for granted they are to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the uſual allowances of clothing and land.—There are ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral continental troops whoſe time of ſervice will expire at the end of the fall or during the winter. I ſhall conſider theſe within the meaning and operation of the reſolve, though they are not mentioned; and ſhall direct every neceſſary meaſure to be taken to re-enliſt them.</p>

This can remain a ſecret, and will not be carried into execution but in caſe of evident neceſſity.—I feel very much intereſted upon the occaſion, and have ſubmitted this mode, that there may not be the leaſt poſſible delay in attempting to engage the men under a ſecond expedient if the firſt ſhould not ſucceed.—The articles of clothing and blankets ſhould alſo employ the utmoſt attention to provide them: we are now in great want, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly of the latter; there not being leſs than actually wanted at this moment.</p>

                  <p>I HAD the pleaſure to hear this morning, by a letter from general Sullivan, of the thirty-firſt ultimo, that he had effected a retreat to the main, the preceding night, without any loſs either of men or ſtores. As he has written to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs fully upon the ſubject, and I feel their anxiety to hear
<pb n="266" facs="unknown:031423_0562_0FEC600E037FC468"/>
it, I ſhall not detain major Morris longer than to obſerve that I think the retreat a moſt fortunate, lucky, and well-timed event.</p>
                  <p>Major Morris informs me he has heard that lord Howe was off Boſton with his fleet: and it appears by a New-York paper of the ſecond, that rear admiral Parker arrived at Sandy-Hook on this day week with ſix ſhips of the line, of ſeventy four guns each,—which is corroborated by other accounts.—I tranſmitted the intelligence to his excellency count D'Eſtaing yeſterday and the day before, as it acquired more and more the appearance of certainty,—as I have regularly done every occurrence intereſting to his fleet and our operations.</p>

                  <p>Since I had the honor of addreſſing you on the fourth and fifth inſtant, I have obtained a return of the blankets which are now deficient.

                  <p>I DO myſelf the honor of returning to Congreſs the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of their committee on the ſubject of an inſpectorſhip (tranſmitted in your letter of the twentieth ultimo, which was not received till the thirty-firſt), with ſuch obſervations as have occurred to me in conſidering the matter, and which I have made with a freedom that I truſt will be agreeable to Congreſs. I wiſh it had been in my power to have returned it before: but the intervention of a variety of other important buſineſs from
<pb n="267" facs="unknown:031423_0563_0FEC5FEB06D1AE88"/>
time to time obliged me to poſtpone a concluſion upon the points till yeſterday.</p>
                  <p>I have already, in my letter of the twenty-ſixth of July, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered my ſentiments upon the conſequences that would attend the baron Steuben's being appointed to an actual and perma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent command in the line; and therefore I will not trouble Congreſs with a repetition of them. However, I will take the liberty to add that I am more and more convinced that what I then ſaid upon the occaſion was well founded; and that I am certain ſuch a meaſure will produce at leaſt infinite diſcontents and diſquietudes among the general officers.</p>
                  <p>I have alſo had the honor to receive your favor of the fifth inſtant, with the ſeveral papers to which it refers. Theſe ſhall have my attention as far as practicable.—I hope all the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate troops are on the march from Philadelphia; and, if they are not, that immediate orders will be given for their joining the army.</p>
                  <p>The incloſed copy of a letter from general Sullivan, of the tenth inſtant, will inform Congreſs that the enemy have not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhed their burning plans, and that in this way they have deſtroyed ſeveral houſes, ſtores, and veſſels, at and near Bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</p>
                  <p>I was adviſed on wedneſday night that a body of them, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of four or five thouſand, under general Grey, had made a landing in that quarter, and were intrenching. In conſequence of this, and from an apprehenſion that general Clinton might poſſibly mean to operate to the eaſtward, and form ſome project in concert with lord Howe againſt the count D'Eſtaing's ſqua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dron, I determined to move the troops from this ground to a rear poſition, better calculated to afford ſupport to the works on the North-river, in caſe an attempt ſhould be made againſt them, and at the ſame time more convenient for forwarding de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachments to the eaſtward, if the enemy point their operations that way.</p>
                  <p>I was the more induced to come to this determination as moſt of the accounts from New-York ſeemed to lead to a belief, as they ſtill do, that a conſiderable movement was and is in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>templation, if not an entire evacuation of the city, and this by water. Beſides theſe reaſons, the principal objects for taking poſt here do not now exiſt. One was to create every poſſible jealouſy in favor of the expedition againſt Rhode-Iſland; ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the conſuming the forage within its vicinity and towards Kingſbridge. The former is now over, and the latter in a great degree accompliſhed.</p>

                  <p>SINCE I had the honor of addreſſing you on the twelfth inſtant, I have received your ſeveral favors of the tenth, twelfth and ſixteenth, with the reſolutions to which they allude.—I tranſmitted the Britiſh commiſſioners the reſolve of the fourth inſtant reſpecting the convention troops the morning after it came to hand, and alſo wrote to ſir Henry Clinton upon the ſubject of paſſports.—I have not received his anſwer.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to the magazines, I have directed the commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to form them on the inland communication from hence to Boſton, at proper intervals. The twenty thouſand barrels of flour that Congreſs have ordered to be purchaſed will be a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable addition, if they can be tranſported by water; but it ſeems to me there will be great riſk of its being loſt, if it is ſent by ſea while the enemy have a ſuperior fleet on our coaſt.</p>
                  <p>As the campaign is not cloſed yet, all our cavalry are of uſe.—They lie in the neighborhood of the enemy's poſts, for the purpoſe of reſtraining their parties, and for obtaining and giving intelligence of the enemy's movements; and they are ſubſiſted upon the forage which would otherwiſe be expoſed to them.—I am ſenſible that theſe corps are attended with great expenſe; and the moment I think the ſervice will admit of it, they or a part of them ſhall be quartered in different places diſtant from the army, where they may be provided for on better terms.—The price of forage; and the difficulty of getting it, are really objects of great magnitude, and ſuch as ſhould undergo ſome regulation, if there is any that can be adopted.—I received let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters a few days ago from the commiſſary and quarter maſter upon this ſubject, copies of which, and of my letter in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence to the ſeveral ſtates from Maſſachuſetts-Bay to Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania incluſive, I take the liberty to incloſe.</p>
                  <p>The reſolution prohibiting officers, except ſuch as are ſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally authoriſed, to keep horſes in the army or within forty miles of it, has been publiſhed in orders, and I will take every ſtep in my power to give it effect.</p>
                  <p>I have conſidered the practicability of reducing the teams em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in the army, and find, however deſirable the object may be, that it cannot be done. We have not at this time more than are abſolutely and indiſpenſably neceſſary, nor ſo many as would be neceſſary in caſe of a rapid movement: neither does it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me that there can be a ſubſtitution of ox for horſe teams,
<pb n="269" facs="unknown:031423_0565_0FEC47C28B001DC8"/>
at leaſt to any great extent; nor that any material advantages would ariſe from ſuch a meaſure. There might perhaps be a ſmall ſaving in the article of provender: but this, I fear, would be greatly over-balanced by the loſs of cattle that would be ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriated to the uſe of the commiſſary's department. After a full inveſtigation of the ſubject, I believe we ſhall be obliged to adhere to the kind of teams we now employ, and that the only relief we ſhall have in point of expenſe will ariſe from ſending a part of the horſes to places where they can more eaſily be foraged, when we have fixed our camp and quarters for the winter.</p>
                  <p>I beg leave to mention to Congreſs that there is a neceſſity of ſome mode's being eſtabliſhed, by which claims on the old quarter-maſterſhip, that remain unſatisfied, may be diſcharged. There are many of this nature; and theſe, however well au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thenticated they may be, the gentlemen now in office do not conceive themſelves at liberty to adjuſt, without obtaining ſome ſpecial direction for the purpoſe. I am every day applied to for payment of ſuch accounts, and, in many inſtances, have been obliged, as well for the ſake of juſtice to individuals as for the public good, to order them to be taken up. It appears to me that Congreſs cannot be too early in their reſolution upon this occaſion, and that either the preſent department ſhould be au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoriſed to ſettle and pay ſuch claims, or that ſome perſons ſhould be appointed and ſupplied with money for the purpoſe.</p>
                  <p>The army marched from White-Plains on the ſixteenth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant, and is now encamped in different places.—Three brigades, compoſing the Virginia troops, part of the right wing, under the command of general Putnam, are at Robinſon's near Weſt-Point: and two brigades more, compoſing the remainder, are with baron De Kalb at Fiſhkill plains, about ten miles from the town, on the road lead leading to Sharon. The ſecond line, with lord Stirling, is in the vicinity of Fredericſburg; and the whole of the left wing at Danbury under the command of gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Gates.—Theſe ſeveral poſts appear to be the beſt we can occupy in the preſent doubtful ſtate of things, as they have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the ſupport of Weſt-Point, in caſe of an attack in that quarter, and are alſo on the communication to the eaſtward, if the enemy point their operations that way.—Beſides theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions, general Scott with a light corps remains below in the country about King's-Street.</p>
                  <p>The letter from ſir Henry Clinton which I have the honor of tranſmitting was ſent to me to-day by colonel Baylor who is poſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at Hackinſac. He ſays he received one for me by the ſame flag; and, from his note, he ſuppoſed he had charged the horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man
<pb n="270" facs="unknown:031423_0566_0FEC47BA2AD91DC0"/>
with it who juſt arrived at head-quarters. Through acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent he forwarded yours to me; and I think it probable that you will be troubled with mine. If this ſhould be the caſe, you will be ſo obliging as to return it to me by the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance.—I was alſo informed by colonel Baylor that a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable body of the enemy landed at Paulus' Hook in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the twenty-ſecond, and were encamped that night in the woods between four and five miles from the town of Bergen. He had not learned their object: but it is likely they are after forage.</p>

                  <p>THE following is an extract of a letter of the ſeventeenth inſtant, which I had the honor to receive from the count D'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Eſtaing.</p>
                  <p>"I entreat you to promote the exchange of priſoners alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day planned by monſieur Girard. The unhappy perſons taken before the commencement of hoſtilities cannot be fully regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as priſoners: their lot is dreadful. The mode adopted for exchanging them by means of your commiſſary, without intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing the king's name or mine into the tranſaction, removes a great part of the political difficulties which before ſubſiſted."</p>
                  <p>I am an entire ſtranger to the plan above referred to, or to the mode that has been adopted for exchanging by means of our commiſſary. He is abſent from the army: and I muſt therefore beg the favor of you to obtain from monſieur Girard ſuch information as will enable me to give directions for carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the count's deſires into execution, if practicable.</p>
                  <p>The marquis De Vienne, at preſent at Boſton, has requeſted a furlough of eighteen months to enable him to return to France, whither he is called by ſome domeſtic concerns. I do not conceive myſelf at liberty to grant his requeſt without the permiſſion of Congreſs, to whom I would beg leave to obſerve, that, if agreeable to them, he may be indulged without pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice to the ſervice, as he is not attached to any particular command.</p>
                  <p>I have juſt received an account from Jerſey, which I fear is too true, that colonel Baylor's regiment of dragoons were ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed in their quarters the night before laſt, and moſt of them killed or taken.—A few of the ſtragglers have come in, who can give but a very imperfect account of the matter. They
<pb n="271" facs="unknown:031423_0567_0FEC5F1544C7A200"/>
think the colonel and moſt of the officers were made priſoners, and that the privates were put to the ſword.—There were, I imagine, about one hundred men of the regiment together when this unlucky accident happened.</p>
                  <p>The ſtay of the enemy in Jerſey being longer than I appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended, and not knowing what their real intentions may be, I have ordered general Maxwell to advance from Elizabethtown to the neighborhood of Aquakenunk bridge, and have ſent over general Woodford's brigade from this ſide of the river. I have alſo ordered general Pulaſki to advance with as much expedition as poſſible, and join the brigades.—Lord Stirling has this day gone over to take the command of the continental forces and militia who are aſſembling in conſiderable numbers. If the enemy mean only to forage, they will be kept from ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending themſelves, by theſe troops: and if they have any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigns upon the poſts in the Highlands, they will be prevented from ſeizing the paſſes leading to the forts, by lord Stirling, who will be between them and the enemy, and always ready to poſſeſs them.</p>
                  <p>I have made proper diſpoſitions on this ſide the river for the ſecurity of the Highlands in caſe that body of the enemy, who are on this ſide Kingſbridge employed in collecting forage, ſhould advance.</p>
                  <p>The ſketch of Rhode-Iſland, forwarded by this expreſs, was received from general Sullivan, and left behind by accident when the laſt diſpatches were ſent off.</p>
                  <p>I have had the honor of receiving yours of the twentieth, incloſing an order for count Pulaſki's legion to advance to Trenton.</p>

                  <p>Being ſeparated from my papers, I am uncertain whether I mentioned in my laſt, that, the enemy in the Jerſeys having received a reinforcement and made ſome forward movements, I had thought it expedient to detach another brigade thither to act in conjunction with the one already there together with Pulaſki's corps and the militia, and had ſent major-general
<pb n="272" facs="unknown:031423_0568_0FEC5F0A5419C850"/>
lord Stirling to take the command of the whole;—that I had alſo ordered major-general Putnam acroſs the river for the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate ſecurity of Weſt-Point, and moved a diviſion of troops to this place, to be nearer that poſt.—I have ſince come here myſelf, and propoſe to remain till the views of the enemy on the Jerſeys are decided; though I have had no reaſon to alter my opinion that nothing more than a forage is intended.—By the laſt accounts, they had drawn in their out-parties, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed their firſt bounds behind Hackinſac river, at the liberty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pole and Newbridge.</p>
                  <p>That part of Baylor's regiment which eſcaped came off in the firſt inſtance, and were afterwards brought off in ſo diperſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a manner that the number has not been aſcertained: but, from what I have learned, I ſhould eſtimate the loſs at about fifty men and ſeventy horſes.—Major Clough is dead of his wounds.—This affair ſeems to have been attended with every circumſtance of cruelty.</p>
                  <p>It is a ſmall compenſation for this accident, that colonel But<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler three or four days ago, with a party of infantry and horſe comprehending major Lee's corps, ſurpriſed about a hundred Yagers below Tarrytown, killed ten on the ſpot, and took a lieutenant and eighteen men priſoners.—The roughneſs of the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THIS will be delivered to you by major-general the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis De la Fayette.—The generous motives, which firſt induc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to croſs the Atlantic and enter the army of the United States, are well known to Congreſs.—Reaſons equally laudable now engage his return to France, which in her preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances claims his ſervices.—His eagerneſs to offer his duty to his prince and country, however great, could not influence him to quit the continent in any ſtage of an unfiniſhed campaign. He reſolved to remain at leaſt till the cloſe of the preſent, and embraces this moment of ſuſpenſe to communicate his wiſhes to Congreſs with a view of having the neceſſary arrangements

made in time, and of being ſtill within reach, ſhould any occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion offer of diſtinguiſhing himſelf in the field.</p>
                  <p>The marquis at the ſame time, from a deſire of preſerving a relation with us, and a hope of having it yet in his power to be uſeful as an American officer, ſolicits only a furlough ſufficient for the purpoſes above-mentioned.—A reluctance to part with an officer, who unites to all the military fire of youth an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon maturity of judgment, would lead me to prefer his being abſent on this footing, if it depended on me. I ſhall always be happy to give ſuch a teſtimony of his ſervices as his bravery and conduct on all occaſions entitle him to; and I have no doubt that Congreſs will add ſuitable expreſſions of their ſenſe of his merit, and their regret on account of his departure.</p>

                  <p>THE inceſſant and preſſing applications of the officers, and their real diſtreſs for clothing, oblige me to repeat my wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es to the board, to obtain the earlieſt direction of Congreſs for relieving their wants.—They are in a very diſagreeable ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in this reſpect; and, unleſs ſome mode can be adopted for ſpeedily ſupplying them, many will be obliged involuntarily to quit the ſervice; or, if this ſhould not be the caſe, we ſhall be involved in perpetual complaints, and the moſt painful applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>I do not recollect, when the army was firſt appointed, that there was any engagement on the part of the public that the officers ſhould be provided with clothing through their means; nor has there been any explicit declaration ſince, that I remember, for the purpoſe: but the meaſure has become indiſpenſably neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; and, without the intervention of public aid, they never can be ſupplied: for their pay, if the articles proper could be found in a private way, (from the enormous and exorbitant prices now exacted for every thing) would prove wholly incompetent to the end.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="274" facs="unknown:031423_0570_0FEC607CCA03CFF0"/>
There is however a reſolution of Congreſs, of the twenty-ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of November laſt, which points to a proviſion through the public means and thoſe of the ſtates individually taken. This has encouraged the officers to look for ſupplies in the manner there profeſſed; and their not being able to obtain them makes them more uneaſy perhaps than if the reſolution had never paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed.</p>
                  <p>I have written to meſſieurs Otis and Andrews to make a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn of the cloth, &amp;c. in their hands, proper for officers, and alſo to adviſe me what quantities might be procured in caſe the board ſhould direct a purchaſe. This appears to be the only practicable expedient at this time, from which relief can be drawn: and, if it is to be adopted, the agents cannot be too ſoon ordered to carry it into execution.—I really wiſh to be inform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the board by the firſt opportunity whether the officers may expect ſupplies through the public ſtores, that I may be able to anſwer them deciſively upon the point when they apply. As matters now ſtand, I am in a very awkward and irkſome ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation.</p>
                  <p>Since it is evident that the officers cannot provide themſelves with clothing, and that there is a neceſſity for the intervention of the public aid, I would ſubmit it to the board whether it may not be proper for them to form an eſtimate of clothing, propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned to the number of officers in the army, for the conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Congreſs, and to obtain their ſanction for importing the ſame, if they approve the plan. This meaſure, it ſeems to me is the only one that can enſure relief in future; and it appears the more eligible as the loſs to the public will be infinitely leſs than if they procure the articles in the country, ſuppoſing that it could be done. Beſides this conſideration, the officers then might be properly uniformed and all placed on a juſt and equal footing.</p>
                  <p>If the board ſhould be authoriſed to direct an immediate purchaſe of clothing for the officers, I will take the liberty to ſuggeſt that it may not be improper for them to enjoin on the part of the clothier a ſtricter compliance with the reſolution of Congreſs, which I have mentioned, in the ſale. The officers ſay that hitherto it has not had the neceſſary and generous operation intended by Congreſs; but, on the contrary, in the few inſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in which they have been able to furniſh themſelves with ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticles from the public ſtores, that they have done it at the cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent exorbitant prices.—Indeed there are many matters in the department which require a more perfect and explicit arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than has ever been made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and at preſent there is ſuch a
<pb n="275" facs="unknown:031423_0571_0FEC5F3CED12C9B0"/>

                  <p>SINCE I had the honor of addreſſing you on the ſixth inſtant by favor of the marquis De la Fayette, I received your letter of the ſecond with its incloſure.</p>
                  <p>I do myſelf the honor of tranſmitting you an account of the engagement between the French and Britiſh fleets on the twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-ſeventh of July, as publiſhed by the Britiſh admiralty-board.—I received a printed copy of it laſt night from New-York, which I have forwarded to his excellency count D'Eſtaing.—It is evident from admiral Keppel's own relation of the affair, that he was pretty ſeverely handled, notwithſtanding he affects in the concluſion to mention that he wiſhed extremely for an opportunity to renew the combat the next day.</p>
                  <p>We are ſtill in great ſuſpenſe as to the operations and deſigns of the enemy, though every practicable meaſure has been uſed and is purſuing to come at them. By late and direct accounts it would ſeem that ſome troops at leaſt are going from New-York. A few days, I think, muſt open their conduct deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively.</p>
                  <p>I have had the misfortune to hear that the Raleigh frigate has become a prize to two Britiſh ſhips of war after a long and very gallant reſiſtance. Captain Barry, finding that the frigate would fall into the enemy's hands, ran her aſhore on Seal-Iſland, to which he eſcaped in boats with about eighty of his hands, and from thence to the main. It is ſaid he took meaſures for blow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her up, but was defeated in his purpoſe by the perfidy of an under officer who concealed himſelf and remained on board.</p>

It ſhould ſeem by this that they are extremely ſolicitous and anxious to know whether New-York is to be garriſoned, which implies a ſuſpicion on their part that it to be evacuated.—All accounts, ſince mine of the fourteenth, confirm the report of a very conſiderable embarkation. It is ſaid to conſiſt of ten Britiſh regiments completed to their full eſtabliſhment, and their grenadier and light companies added to them. This will make them amount to upwards of five thouſand men.—They have not <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I cannot ſay that I am ſatisfied that a total evacuation of the city is intended this winter, although many inhabitants near the lines, and ſeveral out of the city, are of that opinion.—I have ſet every engine at work to procure full intelligence of their deſigns; and I hope to ſucceed. The current opinion of deſerters and others is that the preſent embarkation is intended for the Weſt-Indies; ſome few have ſaid that they have a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign upon Charleſton.</p>

                  <p>THE letter which I had the honor of addreſſing to you the day before yeſterday would inform Congreſs of the embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation and ſailing of a conſiderable detachment of the enemy from New-York, and of the meaſures I had taken in expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of and upon the happening of the event.—Whether this will be ſucceeded by a further embarkation, or by a total eva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuation of the poſts which they hold within the ſtates, in the courſe of this year or the enſuing one, I cannot pretend to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine. But, as it will be right and prudent in us to provide for every contingency, I would with the greateſt deference ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit it to Congreſs whether it may not be proper for them to call upon the ſtates to provide men in time for filling their reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pective battalions, before or at any rate againſt the opening of the ſpring, and in the ſame manner as if there was a moral cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty that the war would be proſecuted with all poſſible vigor on the part of Britain. Should this not be the caſe, or ſhould
<pb n="277" facs="unknown:031423_0573_0FEC60761E9C26B0"/>
any events caſt up in the mean time to render troops unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, it will be eaſy to diſband the levies and to keep them from the field,—while, on the other hand, our relaxation in not providing them may ſubject us at leaſt to many diſagreea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble conſequences.</p>
                  <p>The general return of the infantry in the month of Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, tranſmitted to the board of war by the adjutant-general, and to which I beg leave to refer, will ſhew Congreſs the whole amount of our reputed force at that time. But I am to obſerve, that large, very large deductions are to be made from it on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the columns of ſick, and the men ſaid to be on com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand. Many under the former deſcription, particularly that of ſick abſent, are actually dead; others unfit for ſervice; and ſeveral, who have recovered, have deſerted: nor will the latter afford more than one half of its number in time of action, as various duties, ſuch as waggoning, diſtant guards, eſcorts, &amp;c. employ a great proportion of thoſe under this denomination.</p>
                  <p>Beſides the above deductions, Congreſs will perceive from the return which I now take the liberty of tranſmitting, that there are four thouſand three hundred and eighty draughts and others, whoſe terms of ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>rvice will expire during and by the cloſe of winter: for I am ſorry to add that our exertions to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>engage the draughts and old ſoldiers in this predicament, for the uſual bounty, have proved ſo far ineffectual and without ſucceſs. I have not tried what effect the additional grant of ten dollars might have: but I fear, and it ſeems to be the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of all I have conſulted upon the occaſion, that it would have but little if any influence. I know, in the caſe of the draughts and troops of one ſtate, that the offer of twenty dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars on the part of the continent, with a like allowance and an actual depoſit of it by the ſtate, has been no temptation.</p>
                  <p>The general reluctance and refuſal is founded in the unhappy depreciated light in which the ſoldiery view the money, and their expectation of receiving immenſe ſtate, diſtrict, and ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute bounties. Whether grants or bounties by Congreſs, bearing ſome proportion to theſe, to ſuch as ſhould enliſt for the war, would be attended with better ſucceſs, I cannot un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake to decide. The experiment may be made if they judge it proper: and if it proves an inducement of any extent, it will be an infinite ſaving in the end. I believe however our ſureſt and only certain aids will be derived from draughting, which I truſt may and will be done by the ſtates on the recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation of Congreſs, agreeable to the mode mentioned in my letter to their committee when they firſt honored me with
<pb n="278" facs="unknown:031423_0574_0FEC5FF6A5BE1C00"/>
a viſit at Valley-Forge. The exertions to recruit by volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry enliſtments may ſtill go on, as both modes in all probability will not produce near as many men as may be found neceſſary.</p>
                  <p>In the caſe of the Carolina troops whoſe ſervice is ending every day, the officers ſay that nothing will induce them to enliſt, unleſs they can be permitted to go home on furlough till the ſpring. On this indulgence they ſeem to think ſeveral might be engaged.—The diſtance is great, and there will be ſome uncertainty as to their returning: beſides, it will be fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a precedent for others.—If Congreſs approve the plan, they will be pleaſed to inform me by the earlieſt opportunity.</p>
                  <p>I am under ſome difficulty about clothing the draughts, and the old ſoldiers whoſe ſervice is expiring <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">
                        <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                     </gap> will determine every day. As Congreſs have never expreſſed their ſenſe up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the ſubject, and this is increaſed by a letter which I receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſome time ago from the board of war, which reſpects parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the draughts, I muſt earneſtly requeſt that Congreſs will favor me with the ſpeedieſt direction in the ca<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e, whether they are to be furniſhed out of the ſupplies coming on, equally with the other troops. At the ſame time I will take the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to offer it as my opinion, that, however inconvenient or expenſive it may appear at the firſt view to clothe them, the meaſure will be neceſſary, and founded not only in humanity but found policy. We have no proſpect now of levying men in any other way: and if they are not clothed, they will be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted by ſickneſs and death; and not doing it may prove an inſurmountable bar or at leaſt a great obſtacle to our obtaining future aids, though the exigencies of our affairs ſhould be ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver ſo preſſing. Yet the clothes may be withheld as long as circumſtances will permit, as an inducement for them to enliſt. In the inſtance of the old ſoldiers who have not received the annual allowance of Congreſs, the point ſeems clearly in their favor.—The board ſuggeſted that the draughts might be ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied out of the beſt of the old clothes which might be given in by the troops on receiving new ones:—but unfortunately there will be few of any worth.</p>

In the perſuaſion of this, my letter of the twenty-ſecond to your excellency was written: but, from more recent advices, and through various channels, bearing every mark of authenticity, I am to conclude the ſuppoſition has been ill founded.—The above mentioned fleet appears to have carried away no other troops than inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lids, the officers of the corps lately reduced, with ſome refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gees.—The twenty-third inſtant the troops which had embark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtill remained in the harbor. They are fixed at ten or twelve Britiſh regiments, and ſix of the new levies.—This fleet was probably compoſed of homeward-bound victuallers, with ſome merchantmen and other veſſels which choſe to take the protection of a convoy. The accounts ſtill ſay that they were accompanied by fourteen or fifteen ſail of the line and ſome frigates.</p>

                  <p>By intelligence received yeſterday evening, it is ſaid that tranſports with ten regiments on board had fallen down from York to the watering-place; that there were ſeveral other ſhips laden (not ſaid with what); and that there were others at the wharfs taking in troops. I cannot tell whether this intelligence is certain: for we have been deceived of late in points of infor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that ſeemed to carry equal marks of authenticity.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE been honored with yours of the nineteenth, twenty-ſeventh, twenty-eighth, and twenty-ninth, ultimo.</p>
                  <p>A tolerable ſupply of ſhoes has lately arrived to the iſſuing clothier's ſtore from the eaſtward, Pennſylvania, and Jerſey<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and, if the different perſons employed in procuring that article will exert themſelves to keep up the ſupply, I hope we ſhall not be much diſtreſſed during the winter, provided we remain quietly in quarters.</p>
                  <p>It is much to be wiſhed that Congreſs would come to a ſpee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy reſolution concerning the procuring clothing for the officers at a price in proportion to their pay, more eſpecially, as they were led to expect this from a reſolve which paſſed in Novem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1777.—If the clothing itſelf cannot be conveniently pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured, I imagine the alternative of allowing an adequate ſum of money in lieu thereof would be the next beſt expedient.</p>
                  <p>As the board muſt undoubtedly have experienced the many difficulties ariſing from the want of a proper arrangement of the clothier's department, I hope they will preſs the committee who have that buſineſs in charge, to bring in their report, that the new ſyſtem may be carried into execution without loſs of time.—Whether it has been owing to want of conduct in the late officer, or his want of proper powers and directions, I will not undertake to determine: but the irregularity in that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment has been an endleſs ſource of trouble to me, and a great cauſe of diſcontent in the army.</p>
                  <p>I have given the iſſuing clothier directions to keep an account of the marks and numbers of the bales of blankets, and of the quality of their contents, from whence you will be able to trace from whom thoſe ſmall ones were purchaſed. When the iſſues are completed, you ſhall have the account.—The directions to Mr. Meaſe were very proper.—If any corps want completing in any particular article which is not to be procured here, I will ſign the order myſelf.</p>
                  <p>In the preſent ſcarcity of hats, the caps of which you have

                  <p>I find it impracticable to carry the recommendation of the board, reſpecting calling in the old clothes upon delivery of the new, into execution. The ſoldiers were not to be convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the good policy and economy intended by the application of the old clothes to hoſpitals and the followers of the army, but looked upon it as an unjuſtifiable attempt to deprive them of what they had earned by their year's ſervice, and what (con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the ſcanty ſupply of ſome kinds of covering, blankets in particular) would help to make them more comfortable du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the winter. Theſe diſcontents were communicated to me, the moment they aroſe, by ſome of the beſt officers in the line; which determined me to let the matter drop, more eſpecially as another argument was made uſe of, which was unanſwerable: this was, that, upon a fair ſettlement, there would be found a conſiderable deficiency of the bounty-clothing for a year or two paſt, and that therefore it would be more equitable to make up the deficiency than to draw in the remains.</p>

                  <p>ON wedneſday afternoon I received a letter from the honorable Mr. Lee and Mr. Lovell of the committee for fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign affairs, incloſing a plan and ſundry reſolutions of Congreſs for attacking Canada the next campaign in conjunction with the forces of his moſt chriſtian majeſty,—and requeſting my obſervations upon the ſame to be tranſmitted to Congreſs, and a copy to be delivered to the marquis De la Fayette. Theſe diſpatches, through the indiſpoſition of the marquis (who un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately was ſeized with a fever in his journey from Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia, which ſtill detains him at Fiſhkill), were prevented coming to hand till that time: and the great importance and extent of the ſubject they comprehend would not permit me the honor of an earlier communication of my ſentiments.—I hope Congreſs will excuſe my not complying with that part of the reſolution which requires me to deliver a copy of my ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.
<pb n="283" facs="unknown:031423_0579_0FEC5FFD9C25EEC0"/>
to the marquis, as the manner in which I am obliged to treat the ſubject opens ſuch a proſpect of our wants and our weakneſſes, as, in point of policy, ought only to be knows to ourſelves.</p>
                  <p>I am-always happy to concur in ſentiment with Congreſs; and I view the emancipation of Canada as an object very inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting to the future proſperity and tranquility of theſe ſtates: but I am ſorry to ſay the plan propoſed for the purpoſe does not appear to me to be eligible under our preſent circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces.—I conſider it as my duty, and what Congreſs expects from me, to give my reaſons for this opinion with that frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and candor which the importance of the ſubject demands; and, in doing this, I am perſuaded I ſhall not fail to meet with their approbation.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems to me impolitic to enter into engagements with the court of France for carrying on a combined operation of any kind without a moral certainty of being able to fulfil our parts, particularly if the firſt propoſal came from us. If we ſhould not be able to perform them, it would argue either a want of conſideration, a defective knowledge of our reſources, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing worſe than either, which could not fail to produce a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of diſtruſt and diſcontent that might be very injurious to the Union. In the preſent inſtance, ſhould the ſcheme propoſed be adopted, a failure on our part would certainly occaſion in them a miſapplication of a conſiderable land and naval force which might be uſefully employed elſewhere, and probably their total loſs.—It is true, if we were at this time to enter into the engagement, we ſhould be every day better able to judge whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it will be in our power to accompliſh what may be expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from us: and, if we ſhould find hereafter that our reſources will be unequal to the undertaking, we may give notice to the court of France in ſeaſon to prevent the ſailing of the troops and the ill effects that might attend it. But beſides that a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of this kind could not be embraced by France without its having, an influence on the whole ſyſtem of operations for the next campaign, which of courſe would receive ſome derangement from its being abandoned,—a renunciation of this could not fail to give a very unfavorable impreſſion of our foreſight and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, and would ſerve to weaken the confidence of that court in our public councils.</p>
                  <p>So far from the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e being a moral certainty of our complying with our engagements, it may in my opinion be very ſafely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, that, if the enemy keep poſſeſſion of their preſent poſts at New-York and Rhode-Iſland, it will be impracticable either
<pb n="284" facs="unknown:031423_0580_0FEC607E665723C8"/>
to furniſh the men or the other neceſſary ſupplies for proſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the plan. They will not attempt to keep thoſe poſts with leſs than ten thousand men and a conſiderable navy.—If it ſhould be thought beſt for the advantage of carrying on the expeditions intended, to forego any offenſive operations againſt theſe garri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, and to leave them in quiet poſſeſſion of ſuch important places, we ſhall at leaſt be obliged to provide for the ſecurity of the country againſt their incurſions and depredations, by keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up a force ſufficient to confine them within their own limits. It is natural too to ſuppoſe that the people's expectations of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing protected will grow ſtronger in proportion to the diminution of the enemy's force, and the greater facility with which it can be afforded. They will hardly be content to continue in a ſtate of alarm and inſecurity from a force ſo inconſiderable, while the principal ſtrength of the ſtates is drawn out in the proſecution of remote objects.—If this reaſoning is juſt, we ſhall be obliged to have a larger force than the enemy, poſted in different places to prevent ſudden inroads which they would otherwiſe be able to make at different points: and the number required cannot be eſtimated at leſs than twelve or fifteen thouſand men. This will be two thirds as large a force as we have been able to raiſe and maintain during the progreſs of the war, as theſe calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both of the enemy's ſtrength and of our own are meant to deſignate the number of effective rank and file.</p>
                  <p>If I rightly underſtand the plan in conſideration, it requires for its execution twelve thouſand ſix hundred men rank and file. Beſides theſe,—to open paſſages through a wilderneſs for the march of the ſeveral bodies of troops,—to provide the means of long and difficult tranſportations by land and water,—to eſtabliſh poſts of communication for the ſecurity of our con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voys,—to build and man veſſels of force neceſſary for acquiring a ſuperiority on the lakes;—theſe and many other purpoſes pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiar to theſe enterpriſes, which would be tedious in detail,—will demand a much larger proportion of artificers and perſons to be employed in manual and laborious offices, than are uſual in the ordinary courſe of military operations. When we add the whole together, the aggregate number of men requiſite for the ſervice of the enſuing campaign will be little leſs than dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble the number heretofore in the field: but to be more certain in the calculation, it may be placed at only one half more.</p>
                  <p>Experience is the only rule to judge by in the preſent caſe.—Every expedient has been exhauſted in the preceding cam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paigns to raiſe men; and it was found impoſſible to get toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a greater force than we had, though the ſafety and ſucceſs
<pb n="285" facs="unknown:031423_0581_0FEC5F9F02A8ADE8"/>
of the cauſe ſeemed abſolutely to require it. The natural and direct inference therefore is, that the reſources of the country were inadequate to a larger ſupply. I cannot then ſee that we can hope upon any principle to be equal to ſo much greater ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ertions next year, when the people and the army appear to grow daily more tired of the war, and the depreciation of our money continually increaſing, and of conſequence proving a ſmaller temptation to induce them to engage.</p>
                  <p>The ſtate of our ſupplies for tranſporting and ſubſiſting the troops will ſtand upon a footing equally bad. We have encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered extreme difficulties in theſe reſpects, and have found that it was full as much as we were competent to, to food the army we have already had, and enable it to keep the field and perform the movements required by the contingencies of the ſervice. It is not likely that theſe difficulties will diminiſh; but on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary they will rather multiply as the value of our currency leſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſens: and the enormous prices to which proviſions have riſen, and the artificial ſcarcity created by monopolies, with what we have to fear from the effect of the ſame ſpirit, give us no reaſon to flatter ourſelves that our future proſpects can be much bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
                  <p>In this ſituation of things we are hardly warranted to expect that we ſhall have it in our power to ſatisfy the demands of num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers ſo much greater than we have yet had to ſupply, eſpecially if we conſider that the ſcene of our operations has hitherto been in the heart of the country furniſhing our reſources, which of courſe facilitated the drawing them out,—and that we ſhall then be carrying on the war at an immenſe diſtance, in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try wild and uncultivated, incapable of affording any aid, and great part of it hoſtile. We cannot in this caſe depend on tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary or occaſional ſupplies, as we have been accuſtomed, but muſt have ample magazines laid up beforehand. The labor and expenſe in forming theſe, and tranſporting the neceſſary ſtores of every kind for the uſe of the troops, will be increaſed to a degree that can be more eaſily conceived than deſcribed. The tranſportation muſt be, a great part of the way, through deſerts affording no other forage than herbage; and, from this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, our principal ſubſiſtence of the fleſh kind muſt be ſalted, which would not only be an additional expenſe in the addition<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al conſumption of ſo ſcarce and dear an article as ſalt, but would greatly increaſe the difficulty both of providing and tranſporting. My letter of the twenty-ninth ultimo (tranſmitting a copy of one from the quarter-maſter-general) which I had the honor of addreſſing to Congreſs, and to which I wiſh to refer, will point
<pb n="286" facs="unknown:031423_0582_0FEC6080F9BDC8B8"/>
out the difficulties and daily expenſe attending our ſupplies of the article of flour only, in our preſent circumſtances, excluſive of its coſt,—and lay the foundation for a fort of comparative eſtimate to be formed of thoſe that would attend the ſupport of troops when employed at ſo great a diſtance.</p>
                  <p>If, in addition to all this, we ſhould have the French fleet to ſupply during the winter,—the likelihood of which I have no ſufficient information to ground a judgment upon,—it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſtill more impracticable to furniſh the ſupplies requiſite for the extenſive operations propoſed. But, independent of this, the improbability of doing it is, in my apprehenſion, infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely too great to juſtify the undertaking.</p>
                  <p>This reaſoning is founded on the ſuppoſition that the enemy do not evacuate their preſent poſts at New-York and Rhode-Iſland: nor can we preſume upon any paſt appearances ſo far as to determine the contrary, and enter into a national contract, the fulfilment of which at any rate, in my judgment, will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend on this event. Opinions on the ſubject are various, and the arguments on both ſides cogent. Circumſtances have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been very indeciſive:—at Rhode-Iſland there is nothing that looks like an evacuation, that I have heard of:—at New-York, the length of time that has elapſed ſince the event has been expected, which cannot be ſatisfactorily accounted for, it not a little doubtful and problematical.</p>
                  <p>But if it were even certain that the enemy would ſhortly leave theſe ſtates, I ſhould think our ability to carry on the expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions meditated (from the nature of the country, and the remote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs from the ſource of our ſupplies, joined to the diſcouraging ſituation of our finances) too precarious to authoriſe a precon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed agreement with a foreign power, binding ourſelves to the attempt. On the other hand, if we were certain of doing our part, a co-operation by the French would, in my opinion, be as delicate and precarious an enterpriſe as can be imagined. All the reaſons, which induce France and the United States to wiſh to wreſt Canada and Halifax from the dominion of England, o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate with her perhaps more forcibly to uſe every poſſible effort for their defence. The loſs of them would be a deadly blow to her trade and empire. To hope to find them in a defenceleſs ſtate, muſt be founded in a ſuppoſition of the total incapacity of Britain both by land and ſea to afford them protection.—I ſhould apprehend we may run into a dangerous error by eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mating her power ſo low.</p>
                  <p>We have been informed that a ſtrong garriſon has been late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſent to Halifax, amounting, by report, to about four thouſand
<pb n="287" facs="unknown:031423_0583_0FEC6085816FFB20"/>
men:—a part of the detachments which the enemy are now making from New-York are currently ſaid to be, and in all pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability are, deſtined for that place:—if they evacuate entirely, a very conſiderable part of their force will no doubt go there;—and in any caſe we may expect that reinforcements will be thrown from thence into Canada early in the ſpring. The En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh are now greatly ſuperior to the French by ſea in America, and will from every appearance continue ſo unleſs Spain inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe,—an event which I do not know we are authoriſed to count upon. However, as I am deſtitute of information with reſpect to the preſent ſtate of European politics, this is a point upon which I can form but an imperfect judgment: but if it ſhould not take place. I think it infinitely probable, from the maritime ſituation and advantages of Halifax, which is repreſented as the fineſt port and beſt naval arſenal in America,—from the ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity it is calculated to give to the general trade and poſſeſſions of Britain, both on the continent and in the Weſt-Indies,—that it will be a ſtation for a larger naval force than the one intended to to convoy the French troops:—it will naturally be the principal rendezvous of the Britiſh ſhips of war in Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca. If this poſition be admitted,—ſhould the Engliſh have any knowledge or even ſuſpicion of the deſign of the French court to ſend a fleet up the river Saint Laurence, nothing will be eaſier than to intercept this fleet on its way, or to take or deſtroy it after it has got in. Nor can we flatter ourſelves with keeping this buſineſs a ſecret. Congreſs perhaps will be ſurpriſed to be told that it is already in more hands than they ſuſpect: and, in the progreſs of the negotiation in France, it will get into many more. The preparations will announce the intention.—It is indeed a part of the plan to avow the deſtina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the French troops, though this is to be contradicted by the manner of their clothing, &amp;c.—The ſtationing troops this winter, as is propoſed, particularly on the Mohawk and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut river, would be unequivocal proops of the deſign: it muſt at leaſt excite the ſtrongeſt ſuſpicion, ſo as to put the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh nation upon their guard, and make them take precautions to counteract it.</p>
                  <p>But if the French troops ſhould arrive before Quebec, I think their ſucceſs againſt that ſtrong place, fortified by every advantage of nature and of art, would be extremely doubtful.—It is ſuppoſed this capital poſt will be found in ſo weak a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition as to make its ſurrender a matter of courſe, owing to the enemy's having previouſly drained themſelves for the defence of Detroit, Niagara, Saint John's, Montreal, &amp;c. but we cannot
<pb n="288" facs="unknown:031423_0584_0FEC60900897A948"/>
depend that this will be the caſe:—they may eſteem it the part of prudence rather to ſacrifice or at leaſt to hazard the extremi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties in order to collect their ſtrength at the heart. Montreal indeed, and the poſts eſſential to it, muſt be defended, becauſe the poſſeſſion of them would throw too large a part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try into our hands. But if reinforcements are ſent to Canada early in the ſpring,—a circumſtance extremely likely,—theſe may be attended to without too far weakening the garriſon at Quebec; and, as before obſerved, we cannot build upon their conduct's being regulated by an ignorance of our plans. The French troops inſtead of a coup-de-main, would in this caſe be reduced to the neceſſity of carrying on a blockade.</p>
                  <p>I will now take the liberty to turn my attention towards the operations of our own troops. The one againſt Detroit I ſhall at preſent ſay nothing about: if well conducted, I ſhould hope that place would fall without very great difficulty.—The caſe is very different with reſpect to Niagara. This, I am informed, is one of the ſtrongeſt fortreſſes in America, and can only be reduced by regular approaches or by famine. In accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this, laſt war, and a conqueſt as far as Montreal, I believe general Amherſt exhauſted two campaigns, with all the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages which he derived from the united efforts of Britain and America, with every convenience for water-tranſportation, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluding plenty of ſeamen, and with money that commanded every thing which either country could furniſh. The former mode would require great perſeverance, time, and labor, and an ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratus which it would be almoſt impracticable to tranſport. The latter is practicable, but very difficult. To effect it, we muſt gain a ſuperiority on the lakes, The enemy have already a reſpectable force there:—if they ſuſpect our deſign, which they cannot fail to do from the meaſures to be taken, they may improve the interval in adding to it; and, by providing mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rials and artificers upon the ſpot, they may be able to increaſe it ſo as to keep pace with us. It is therefore eaſy to ſee that we ought not to be too ſanguine in the ſucceſs of this expedition, and that, if a moderate force be imployed in the defence of Nia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara without degarniſhing Quebec and the intermediate poſts, its reduction will be a very arduous taſk.</p>
                  <p>The body of troops to penetrate by way of the river Saint Francis muſt meet with great obſtacles: they will have a march of about a hundred and fifty miles from Cohoſs, which is about a hundred and ſixty miles beyond Hartford, a great part of which is through a hitherto-uninhabited and trackleſs country, with an immenſe train of waggons: all the ſtores and proviſions
<pb n="289" facs="unknown:031423_0585_0FEC5F24103B4218"/>
for the whole march, and the future ſupply of the troops, at leaſt till they ſhould get footing in Canada, muſt accompany them from the beginning. The impediments and delays in ſuch a march almoſt exceed conception.</p>
                  <p>When arrived at the Saint Laurence, freſh obſtacles proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly would preſent themſelves. The preſumption is, that, if the enemy could not make head there, they would deſolate the country through which they were to paſs, deſtroy all the proviſion and forage, remove every kind of water craft, and demoliſh the materials for building others. Theſe precautions being taken on the Sorelle and Saint Laurence would pretty effectually ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct our progreſs both to Montreal and Cadoroqui,—to ſay no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of the rapidity of the current and the numerous rifts be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Montreal and Lagalette.</p>
                  <p>When we deliberately conſider all the obſtacles in the execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the difficulties we ſhall find in preparing the vaſt ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gazines required, which have been already enumerated, if with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the compaſs of our reſources, we ſhall be led to think it not very improbable that this body may be unable to penetrate Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nada, at leaſt in time to co-operate with the French troops, if a co-operation ſhould be neceſſary. The ſituation of theſe troops then would be delicate and dangerous:—expoſed to a defeat from the united force of the enemy, in great danger of having their retreat cut off by a ſuperior naval force in the river, they would have every thing to fear. On the other hand, if our ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations ſhould be as ſucceſsful as we may flatter ourſelves, a tempeſt or a Britiſh fleet may deprive us of our expected aid; and at a critical moment we may find ourſelves in the boſom of an enemy's country, obliged to combat their whole force with one inferior and reduced by a tedious and waſting march. The five thouſand men, when they arrived in Canada, would proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly little exceed four capable of ſervice; and would be ſtill leſs, if out of them we ſhould eſtabliſh poſts as we advanced, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure a retreat and protect eſcorts of proviſion which muſt follow for future ſupport. Thus an accident in either caſe would in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve the defeat of the whole project; and the cataſtrophe might be attended with the moſt unhappy conſequences to America.</p>
                  <p>The plan propoſed appears to me not only too extenſive and beyond our abilities, but too complex. To ſucceed, it requires ſuch a fortunate coincidence of circumſtances as could hardly be hoped, and cannot be relied on;—the departure of the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my from theſe ſtates, without which we cannot furniſh the ſtipu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated force, or ſupplies to maintain them,—ſuch a want of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er or want of foreſight in the enemy as will oblige then to ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
<pb n="290" facs="unknown:031423_0586_0FEC604E55109BD0"/>
the reinforcement of Halifax and of Canada, and prevent them, however conveniently ſituated, from the diſputing the paſſage of the four ſhips of the line and four frigates up the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver Saint Laurence, or attempting their deſtruction afterwards,—ſuch a combination of favourable incidents as will enable ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral bodies acting ſeparately and independently by ſea and land, and from different countries, to conform to times and periods ſo as to enſure a co-operation;—theſe and many other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances muſt conſpire, to give ſucceſs to the enterpriſe.</p>
                  <p>Congreſs, I am perſuaded, had powerful reaſons for fixing the convoy at the number they have: and their ſuperior informati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on reſpecting the affairs of Europe at this preſent juncture ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles them to judge much better than I can pretend to do, of its ſufficiency. But from the imperfect view I have of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, I have been led, in conſidering the ſubject, to look upon it as inſufficent. From the general tenor of intelligence, the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh out-number the French in the channel: in America, both on the continent and in the iſlands, they are greatly ſuperior. If the laſt Toulon fleet is employed in the Mediterranean, the French may have the ſuperiority there: but, upon the whole, the balance of naval force ſeems hitherto to be on the ſide of the Engliſh. If we add to this that the number of ſhips of war in the French ports, built or building, bears no compariſon to the number in the Engliſh ports,—and that Britain notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the diminution ſhe has ſuffered, is ſtill a kingdom of great maritime reſources,—we ſhall be diſpoſed to conclude that the preponderance is too likely to continue where it is. The interpoſition of Spain indeed would make a very intereſting change; but her backwardneſs heretofore ſeems to be an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that ſhe is withheld from interfering by ſome weighty poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical motives: and how long theſe may continue to reſtrain her, is a queſtion I am unqualified to determine.</p>
                  <p>Beſides theſe general objections to the plan which have been ſtated, there appear to me to be ſome particular ones which I ſhall take the liberty to point out.</p>
                  <p>In the firſt place I obſerve there are to be five thouſand mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tia employed in the two expeditions againſt Detroit and Niaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ra.—The drawing into ſervice ſo large a number compoſed chiefly of huſbandmen, in addition to what may be found neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for other exigencies on the coaſt at ſo intereſting a ſeaſon of the year, will certainly be very injurious to the culture of our lands, and muſt tend to add to the deficiency of ſupplies. But this, though not to be overlooked, is not the principal ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection.—In the expedition againſt Detroit, militia perhaps may
<pb n="291" facs="unknown:031423_0587_0FEC6007699026E8"/>
anſwer, as it is not a poſt of very great ſtrength, and may poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly be abandoned on or in a little time after the approach of a force that cannot be oppoſed in the field, and the garriſon pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to reinforce that of Niagara. But even here troops of another kind would be far preferable. However, the caſe will be very different with reſpect to this laſt:—it is, as I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore mentioned, one of the ſtrongeſt fortreſſes of America, and demands for its reduction the very beſt of troops. Militia have neither patience nor perſeverance for a ſiege. This has been demonſtrated by all the experience we have had. An attempt to carry on one which ſhould materially depend on them would be liable to be fruſtrated by their inconſtancy in the moſt criti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal moments.—Agreeable to the plan under conſideration, three thouſand five hundred out of five thouſand ſix hundred are to be militia.</p>
                  <p>It is a part of the plan that the troops ſent againſt Detroit, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſucceſsful or not, are to form a junction with thoſe at Nia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gara. It appears to me on the contrary, that the expedition a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt Detroit, under the preſent arrangement, muſt ſtand on its own bottom, and have no other object than the reducing that place and deſtroying the adjacent Indian ſettlements. Lake Erie is certainly occupied by two armed veſſels of ſixteen and eighteen guns, and, it is ſaid, by five or ſix others of ſmaller ſize, having two, three, or four guns each, which, while the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my hold Niagara, will prevent the communication of our troops by way of the lake,—to ſay nothing for want of batteaux for tranſportation. A communication by land muſt be performed through an extent of more than four hundred miles, and a great part of this at leaſt under many diſadvantages of route, and through tribes of hoſtile Indians.</p>
                  <p>My knowledge of the country is not ſufficiently accurate to enable me to diſcover the reaſons which determined Congreſs to divide the force deſtined againſt Niagara, and to appoint the march of one body from Ononguaga to that place. It ſeems to me however that this diſpoſition might be ſubject to one great inconvenience, which is, that, if each column be not ſuperior to the whole collective force of the enemy, they riſk being beaten ſeparately and ſucceſſively, beſides the trouble and expenſe of preparing as it were for two expeditions inſtead of one,—of opening two roads inſtead of one,—and the uncertainty of a co-operation (if no diſaſter ſhould happen to either) at the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when it might be neceſſary. The inquiries I have as yet had it in my power to make are oppoſed to the practicability of conveying cannon in the route from Ononguaga to Niagara, or
<pb n="292" facs="unknown:031423_0588_0FEC60921B1CBC20"/>
at leaſt place it as a point infinitely doubtful: and, without can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non, nothing can be effected againſt that poſt. Upon the whole, the great matter eſſential to ſucceſs againſt Niagara is to ſubdue the enemy's force on lakes Eric and Ontario, particularly the latter. This once done, and the garriſon by that means cut off from its ſupplies, the fort will be likely to fall an eaſy prey. Here our efforts ſhould be directed: nor do I at preſent perceive the purpoſes to be anſwered by the body going from Ononguaga, unleſs the devaſtation of the intermediate Indian villages be the object,—which perhaps may not be equal to the riſk, labor, and expenſe, and the more ſo as they would fall of courſe if we ſhould ſucceed in the general operation.</p>
                  <p>The cantoning five thouſand troops this winter on Connecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cut-river, under our preſent proſpects, will, in my opinion be impracticable, and, in any caſe, unadviſable.—When I had the honor of writing to Congreſs in September laſt on the ſubject of a winter campaign into Canada, I had been led by [<hi>colonel</hi>] Bai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley, and other gentlemen acquainted with the country, to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect that very conſiderable magazines of proviſions might be laid up on the upper parts of that river. But it appears on ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periment that their zeal for the expedition made them too ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guine in the matter. The purchaſes fall far ſhort of what was expected. The difficulties of tranſportation, as repreſented by the quarter-maſters and commiſſaries, ſupported by facts that ſpeak for themſelves, are ſo great and ſo complicated that I ſhould have no hope of being able, from remote parts of the continent, to throw in the quantity requiſite for ſubſiſting theſe troops during the winter, and at the ſame time of forming the magazines which would be neceſſary to proſecute the expedition in ſpring. We may be endeavouring to form the magazines: but the troops cannot be on the ſpot this winter; otherwiſe they will exhauſt the proviſion as faſt as it can be collected.—The ſame objection applies to the ſtationing troops on the Mohawk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>river.</p>
                  <p>In eſtimating our force for the next campaign, it is to be conſidered that upwards of four thouſand of the preſent army will have completed their terms of ſervice by the laſt of May next, and that a great proportion of the remainder will have done the ſame about the cloſe of the enſuing fall, unleſs they can be induced to re-engage,—of which the ill ſucceſs of our preſent exertions to enliſt thoſe whoſe engagements are about to expire afford but an unfavorable proſpect. This and the general temper of the officers, diſſatisfied much with their ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation,
<pb n="293" facs="unknown:031423_0589_0FEC6054CC49C468"/>
will ſuggeſt a ſtrong argument againſt the extenſive pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects in contemplation.</p>
                  <p>In whatever point of light the ſubject is placed, our ability to perform our part of the contract appears to me infinitely too doubtful and precarious to juſtify the undertaking, A failure, as I have already obſerved, would involve conſequences too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate and diſagreeable to be hazarded. But, at the ſame time that my judgment is againſt this, I am clearly of opinion that we ſhould attempt every thing that our circumſtances will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit: but, as the extent of our power muſt be regulated by many poſſible events, I would wiſh to hold ourſelves free to act according to either poſſibility, and as a clearer view of our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture reſources may authoriſe.—If the enemy entirely leave theſe ſtates, it will produce a vaſt change in our affairs; and new proſpects may open, of which we can at preſent have but a very imperfect idea. It would be a great ſtep towards raiſing the value of our money, which would give a new ſpring to our military operations.—We may be able to undertake much more than we can now foreſee.</p>
                  <p>If the enemy attempt to keep poſts in theſe ſtates, a primary object will be to expel them if in our power:—if not we muſt make proper proviſion to bar their depredations, and muſt turn our attention to the ſecurity of our frontiers, by purſuing ſuch meaſures as ſhall be within the reach of our abilities.—Though we may not be able to launch into ſo wide a field as we could wiſh, ſomething upon a more particular ſcale may be enterpriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Detroit and Niagara may perhaps be reduced, though Canada may not be an acceſſion to the confederacy.—With a view to what is poſſible, preparations may be going on, and we can make ſuch an application of them as we ſhall find practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.</p>
                  <p>As there is no time to be loſt in doing this, I ſhall give the neceſſary orders ſo far as relates to the article of proviſion, which indeed has been already done it part. Magazines of forage, materials for boat and ſhip building, and other articles, muſt alſo be provided,—which will depend on the final arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and more definitive inſtructions of Congreſs. Theſe meaſures will be neceſſary to be taken whether the preſent plan is carried on, or whether ſomething leſs extenſive, depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing wholly on ourſelves, is ſubſtituted in its place.—I ſhall wait the further orders of Congreſs for the government of my conduct in delivering the plan to the marquis as their reſolution ſeems to require, or in tranſmitting it immediately to doctor Franklin as the letter from the committee ſeems to direct. At

                  <p>I HAD the honor of receiving your favor of the ſixth yeſterday, with the incloſed copy of a letter from the preſident of the council of New-Jerſey, relative to an expected attack upon the weſtern frontier of that ſtate.—I have juſt received a letter from general Hand giving intelligence of an attack up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on colonel Alden's regiment at Cherry-Valley, effected by ſurpriſe, in conſequence of which, there is too much reaſon to apprehend that regiment may fall a ſacrifice. I tranſmit a copy of the diſpatches announcing this diſagreeable affair.</p>
                  <p>Theſe depredations of the enemy give me the moſt ſerious concern. I lament that we have not yet had it in our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> to give them an effectual check. I am perfectly convinced that the only certain way of preventing Indian ravages is to carry the war vigorouſly into their own country. But as this is thought impracticable at this late ſeaſon of the year from the ſtate of the water, and other impediments, I fear we muſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent

Orders are now given to colonel Spencer's regiment and colonel Armand's corps to join general Pulaſki.—This diſpoſition is agreeable to the opinion of governor Clinton and other gentlemen acquainted with the country whom I have conſulted, and is calculated to cover the eaſtern frontier of Pennſylvania, New-Jerſey, and the weſtern part of New-York.—I ſhall alſo immediately ſend the remainder of general Clinton's brigade to Albany.

                  <p>BY the time this reaches you, general Du Portail will probably be at Philadelphia. One part of his buſineſs is to proſecute the directions given him ſome time ſince for forming a plan for the defence of the river Delaware, to be ſubmitted to Congreſs: another part is to underſtand from Congreſs what may be their views and wiſhes with reſpect to his further conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuance in America, and that of the three other gentlemen at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to him.</p>
                  <p>He informs me that the furlough he obtained from the court of France expires in February next, and that, unleſs there is a certain proſpect of his being employed hereafter in a manner uſeful to the ſtates and honorable to himſelf, he intends imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to return. He therefore wiſhes ſome explicit ideas to be realiſed on the ſubject. He is alſo anxious that ſomething definitive ſhould be done with reſpect to the pay and the other appointments both of himſelf and the other gentlemen with him, which have been hitherto undecided, and have left them in an uncertain and diſagreeable ſituation.—Added to this, he is deſirous to have ſome arrangement fixed for the rules and manner of ſervice in his department.</p>
                  <p>He delivered me, ſome days ſince, a memorial intended for Congreſs, and which I have now the honor to incloſe, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his ideas on a general ſyſtem of fortification for theſe ſtates, and which he requeſted me to accompany with my ſentiments.
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:031423_0593_0FEC5F4A27ACE410"/>
But it includes queſtions of finance and conſiderations of policy the moſt extenſive and important, of which Congreſs alone can form a competent judgment. I ſhall therefore only ſay, that, conſidered merely in a military point of view, the plan appears to me worthy of very ſerious attention.</p>
                  <p>It is but juſtice to general Du Portail to obſerve that I have a high opinion of his merit and abilities, and eſteem him not only well acquainted with the particular branch he profeſſes, but a man of ſound judgment and real knowledge in military ſcience in general. I have alſo a very favorable opinion of the other gentlemen. I will take the liberty to add that it appears to me that it will be extremely neceſſary and uſeful in our fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture operations, whether directed to offence or defence,—whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to diſpoſſeſs the enemy of poſts in our front, to aſſiſt in carrying on the propoſed expedition into Canada, or any other on a leſs extenſive plan which may be ſubſtituted in its ſtead for the mere ſecurity of our frontier.</p>
                  <p>Monſieur De Murnon has ſerved in quality of engineer under general Du Portail ſince the firſt of March laſt, with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe of a majority from the committee of arrangement at Val<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ley-Forge. He has never yet received his commiſſion. This, I preſume, has been forgotten in a crowd of more important af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs.—With the greateſt reſpect and eſteem, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>MR. Wheelock will have the honor of preſenting this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to your excellency. He waits on Congreſs upon the affairs of a regiment under the command of colonel Bedel, which, it ſeems, was raiſed in the Cohoſs county, or at leaſt has been
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:031423_0594_0FEC60A3C6965720"/>
kept up ſince March laſt upon the recommendation of the mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quis Fayette when at Albany. This corps, according to the incloſed ſtate by Mr. Wheelock, who is the lieutenant-colonel, to which I beg leave to refer Congreſs, and according to other information I have received, was at firſt aſſembled under the direction of major-general Gates about this time twelvemonth, for the purpoſe of a ſudden enterpriſe againſt St. John's, and the enemy's armed veſſels lying there, and was engaged till the laſt of March.</p>
                  <p>I cannot undertake to ſay in what manner or how uſefully this regiment has been employed, or to what extent in point of men. But Mr. Wheelock ſays it has been of great ſervice: and the object of his preſent journey is to obtain the direction of Congreſs for their being paid when proper rolls are produced, and their determination whether it is to be diſbanded now, or continued till April next, the period for which the men are ſaid to have engaged, though the marquis's recommendation extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to the end of the preſent campaign.</p>
                  <p>The regiment may or may not be neceſſary in future. Much will depend on the ſyſtem of conduct the enemy purſue the next campaign, and on our own operations. I would obſerve, under its preſent engagement, its ſervices were to be local, or at leaſt confined to a certain quarter. If it ſhould be deemed expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to re-enliſt it, if practicable it ſhould be done on the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral ſcale of acting wherever it may be requiſite (though perhaps it may not be poſſible to accompliſh it): and, in ſuch caſe, it will alſo be material for the public to have a more perfect know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of its arrangements than what I apprehend it has hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to had.—I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

I have to regret that the condition of affairs is ſuch as does not admit of a compliance with repeated detachments from this army. However, that every thing poſſible might be done un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our preſent circumſtances, general Hand was further in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed on the ſixteenth inſtant to confer with general Schuy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler at Albany, and with thoſe perſons in that part of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try who could in any manner aſſiſt in forming his judgment on the beſt meaſures to be purſued with the troops which were employed in the ſeveral quarters: and yeſterday I changed his command to that of the Miniſinks, and forwarded him an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from colonel Hartley's letter of the ninth, that he might accommodate his diſpoſitions to recent events. I have only to add on this ſubject, that, on the twentieth, brigadier-general Clinton ſet out to take the command at Albany, with directions to conſult with general Hand, and to form with him ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined arrangements as may appear moſt conſiſtent with their u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited ſtrength.—I am, ſir, with great reſpect, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>YOUR excellency's letter of the eighteenth, with the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſure referred to, came to hand yeſterday.—I had before re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the intelligence contained in Mr. Deane's letter, and in conſequence made part of the detachments which have been mentioned in my late letters. It is highly probable that the
<pb n="300" facs="unknown:031423_0596_0FEC60B41DE8A1A8"/>
late incurſions and outrages were committed by the parties com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended in Mr. Deane's intelligence; and I ſhould hope that the force already gone from the army, together with the ſeaſon, will prevent them at leaſt from making further great depreda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                  <p>Since I had the honor of addreſſing your excellency on the twenty-firſt, I received a letter from general Hand, of the eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, an extract from which you will find incloſed, with copies of a letter from major Whiting and one from a Mr. Clyde.—Theſe will inform Congreſs, that, though the ravages at Cher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-Valley ſettlement were great in the late attack by the ſava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, yet our loſs was much leſs than we had reaſon to apprehend it from our former advices. The account of the enemy's hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtormed the fort, and cut off Alden's regiment, happily turns out premature. The incloſure, No. 2, which is a copy of a letter from lord Stirling of the ſeventeenth, will adviſe Congreſs that the fleet of tranſports, which had lain at the Hook for ſome days before, came up the preceding night to the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering-place, and alſo that ſome of the ſhips of war had return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to York diſmaſted.—Your excellency will alſo ſee by the incloſure, No. 3, (which contains an extract from a letter from general Sullivan, of the eighteenth inſtant) the lateſt advices I have reſpecting admiral Biron's fleet.—From the loſs of the Somerſet, and theſe ſeveral accounts, they ſuffered ſeverely in their late cruiſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>November</hi> 24.—I juſt received from general Hand the incloſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed petition from major Whitcomb, addreſſed to Congreſs, and his letter to general Hand, of the ſame date. My information reſpecting the corps under major Whitcomb's command has hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been very imperfect; and even now I do not know the terms on which it was engaged: nor had I, till theſe letters came to hand, any reaſon to think that the troops above had not all been equally paid, having ſent up a ſupply of money for the purpoſe ſoon after I came to this camp, and authoriſed the paymaſter-general a few days ago to forward a further quantity.—I ſhall immediately write to general Clinton, now on his way to Albany, to ſend a proper officer to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>s;ter the corps, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo three companies (which he calls provincials) under his direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſaid to be engaged to the firſt of next month; after which, both will be paid on his preſenting proper rolls.—With reſpect to clothing, the only application I recollect to have had from major Whitcomb was anſwered with ſuch ſupplies, both in quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity and quality, as our ſtores would admit of. It may perhaps be practicable hereafter to put his corps on a better footing in this inſtance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="301" facs="unknown:031423_0597_0FEC60B614F6A748"/>
The alarm which major Whitcomb ſpeaks of in the beginning of his letter to general Hand was occaſioned (as Congreſs will perceive by a copy of another letter from him to general Hand) by a deſcent made by a body of men in the country about the ſouth end of lake Champlain, and who, according to his report, have done conſiderable damage.</p>
                  <p>I directed general Portail ſome time ago to take a view of the works carrying on in the Highlands for the defence of the North-river, and to make an eſtimate of the cannon neceſſary for the purpoſe. This he did: and, as he is now at Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia, I have written to him by this conveyance, and requeſted him to preſent the eſtimate to Congreſs. I am ſorry the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber wanted is ſo great, and the more ſo as I find upon inquiry that the Saliſbury furnace in Connecticut, which uſed to caſt ſo many, is much out of repair, and could not poſſibly be put in order, and in a proper ſtate for ſupplies, before May.—The providing of cannon is a matter of infinite importance; and I am perſuaded Congreſs will take every means in their power to accompliſh it. Beſides the preſſing and extenſive demand for the works on the North-river, we cannot extend our views too ſoon to the obtaining further large ſupplies. We muſt in the courſe of things have occaſion for a great deal of artillery: and, in any enterpriſe we may undertake againſt Canada, whether on a large or ſmall ſcale, ſeveral peices of various calibers will be abſolutely eſſential. Beſides arming the ſhips and veſſels we ſhall be obliged to build to gain the navigation of the lakes, our land operations will require a great number.</p>
                  <p>A detachment of continental troops will conduct thoſe of the convention from the North-river to the Delaware. The Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man battalion is to compoſe part of the eſcort: and, after the convention troops croſs to Pennſylvania, I have directed it, in conſequence of the intelligence tranſmitted of late by Congreſs reſpecting the frontiers, to proceed to Eaſton with all its bag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage, where it is to wait till general Hand arrives at the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinks, and whence it will be ready to act as circumſtances may require. At the ſame time, if theſe frequent detachments from the army could be avoided, it were much to be wiſhed. The troops will be by this means in a very diſperſed ſtate; and, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides loſing perhaps ſome advantages which might preſent them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves if they were more collected, their diſcipline will be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly injured, and it will be extremely difficult, from a variety of cauſes, to draw them together again: and, if it ſhould be prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticable, it is highly probable we ſhall find their number much impaired by deſertion and otherwiſe.</p>

His hiſtory is that he is a native of Connecticut, and about eight years ago, as he informs me, ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tled in the country between Detroit and Pittſburg as an Indian trader;—that he carried on commerce till January 1776, when, for his attachment to our cauſe and the meaſures he had taken to promote it, be became obnoxious to the enemy, was ſeized by order of the governor of Detroit, was thrown into priſon, and there continued till the beginning of May laſt, when he was ſent to Quebec;—that on the ninth of October he eſcaped from thence and got into our ſettlements, through the aid of a French Caghnewaga who came with him here on friday laſt.</p>
                  <p>I find Mr. Dodge an intelligent young man, intimately ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with all the tract of country between Pittſburg and Detroit, and with that lying on Lake Erie, alſo with moſt of the ſavage tribes in thoſe parts, and with their languages. He is likewiſe well acquainted with the communication from Fort-Stanwix to O<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>wego and Niagara.</p>
                  <p>I believe Mr. Dodge's hiſtory to be true; and, from a vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of circumſtances, I am perſuaded of his firm attachment to us: and I would take the liberty to ſuggeſt to Congreſs that I think he may be of very important ſervice to us in any enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe we may undertake in the weſtern quarter, or againſt the force on Lake Erie or Lake Ontario. This conſideration, with that of his loſſes and ſufferings which I am inclined to believe have been conſiderable, ſeems to make him worthy of notice and attention.—His information is good and clear in ſeveral points which I know myſelf, and in many others (from the manner in which he delivered it) far ſuperior and much more ſatisfactory than what I have been able to derive from any other perſon.—As I have obſerved before, Mr. Dodge appears to me a valuable intelligencer; and, if Congreſs are pleaſed to honor him with an opportunity, he will give them an account of the poſts of Detroit and Niagara when he left them, and of that at Michilimachinac,—of the enemy's naval force on Lakes Erie and Ontario, and of ſuch other matters in Canada as he was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to inform himſelf of, either by his own obſervation or the relation of others.</p>
                  <p>General Gates ſupplied Mr. Dodge with ſome money to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray his expenſes from Boſton to this place, and I have advanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to-day a hundred and fifty dollars more to carry him to Philadelphia.—I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

                     <salute>SIR,</salute>
                  </opener>
                  <p>I WAS yeſterday honored with your favor of the twenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, with its ſeveral incloſures.—Congreſs will be pleaſed to accept my acknowledgments for the communication of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties between his moſt chriſtian majeſty and the United States. The reſolve reſpecting the exchange of priſoners has been tranſmitted to ſir Henry Clinton, and I have appointed com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioners (if he thinks proper) to meet his at Amboy the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of next month.</p>
                  <p>I have the pleaſure to inform Congreſs that the whole army (one brigade and the light corps excepted) is now in motion to the places of their reſpective cantonments for winter-quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. I have thought it prudent to delay this event a while, to give time for the convention troops to make ſome progreſs in croſſing the North-river, to prevent a poſſibility of accident. The third diviſion paſſes this day; and, if no unexpected inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption happens, the whole will be over, the thirtieth inſtant. When their paſſage is completed, the remaining troops kept in the field will immediately retire to quarters.</p>
                  <p>The diſpoſition for winter-quarters is as follows:—Nine bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades will be ſtationed on the weſt ſide of Hudſon's river ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſive of the garriſon at Weſt-Point,—one of which (the North-Carolina brigade) will be near Smith's Clove for the ſecurity of that paſs, and as a reinforcement to Weſt-Point in caſe of neceſſity; another (the Jerſey brigade) will be at Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabethtown, to cover the lower part of Jerſey; and the other ſeven, conſiſting of the Virginia, Maryland, Delaware, and Pennſylvania troops, will be at Middlebrook.—Six brigades will be left on the eaſt ſide of the river and at Weſt-Point;—three of which (of the Maſſachuſetts troops) will be ſtationed for the immediate defence of the Highlands; one at Weſt-Point in ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to the garriſon already there; and the other two at Fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kill and the Continental Village.—The remaining three bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gades, compoſed of the New-Hampſhire and Connecticut troops, and Hazen's regiment, will be poſted in the vicinity of Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bury, for the protection of the country lying along the Sound,
<pb n="304" facs="unknown:031423_0600_0FEC60C7438EF708"/>
to cover our magazines lying on Connecticut-river, and to aid the Highlands on any ſerious movement of the enemy that way.—The park of artillery will be at Pluckenim.—The ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valry will be diſpoſed of thus:—Bland's regiment at Wincheſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in Virginia, Baylor's at Frederic or Hagarſtown in Mary<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Moylan's at Lancaſter in Pennſylvania, and Sheldon's at Durham in Connecticut. Lee's corps will be with that part of the army which is in the Jerſeys acting on the advanced poſts.—This comprehends the general diſtribution of the army, except Clinton's brigade of New-York troops, Pulaſki's corps, and ſome detached regiments and corps ſtationed at Albany and at different parts of the frontier, of which Congreſs have already been particularly adviſed.—General Putnam will com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand at Danbury, General M'Dougal in the Highlands, and my own quarters will be in the Jerſeys, in the neighborhood of Middlebrook.</p>
                  <p>This diſpoſition appeared to me beſt calculated to conciliate as far as poſſible theſe ſeveral objects,—the protection of the country, the ſecurity of the important poſts in the Highlands, the ſafety, diſcipline, and eaſy ſubſiſtence of the army.—To have kept the troops in a collected ſtate would have increaſed infinitely the expenſe and difficulty of ſubſiſting them, both with reſpect to forage and proviſions: to have divided them into ſmaller cantonments would have made it far leſs practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to maintain order and diſcipline among them, and would have put them leſs in a condition to control and prevent offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive operations on the ſide of the enemy, or to aſſemble to take advantage of any favorable opening which their future ſituation may offer, ſhould they be obliged to weaken themſelves by further detachments ſo far as to invite an enterpriſe againſt them.</p>
                  <p>By the eſtimate of the quarter-maſter and commiſſary-gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, it appears indiſpenſable to have the principal part of the army on the other ſide of the North-river. It was thought impracticable to furniſh the neceſſary ſupplies of flour for the whole, on this ſide the river, from the immenſe difficulty and expenſe of tranſportation in the winter ſeaſon, and from the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted ſtate of the country with reſpect to forage.—As this ſubject has been already fully before Congreſs, I ſhall not trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble them with a repetition of the detail.—In order as much as poſſible to reduce the demand of forage and facilitate the ſupplies, I have given directions, when the ſeveral diviſions ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive at their cantonments, to ſend away to convenient places at a diſtance from them all the horſes not abſolutely requiſite to carry on the ordinary buſineſs of the army.</p>

                     <pb n="305" facs="unknown:031423_0601_0FEC6098EF259098"/>
It is unneceſſary to add that the troops muſt again have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to the expedient of hutting as they did laſt year. But, as they are now well clad, and we have had more leiſure to make ſome little preparations for winter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap>, I hope they will be in a more comfortable ſituation than they were in the preceding winter.—With the higheſt reſpect and eſteem, I have the honor to be, &amp;c.</p>

                  <p>BETWEEN Fredericſburg and this place where I arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved yeſterday afternoon, I had the honor to receive your ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency's ſeveral favors of the twenty-ſixth, twenty-ſeventh, and twenty-eighth, in due order, with their ſeveral incloſures, which ſhall have my attention. My being on the road from the time of their coming to hand till yeſterday prevented me from acknowledging them before.</p>
                  <p>As many inconveniences would attend the removing of the ſick officers and men of the convention troops by land, and the officers having families, I have written to general Gates to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to proceed to the falls of James'-river by water, on the officers' giving their paroles that they and the men will perform the voyage. I have alſo acquainted him of the meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in contemplation for an exchange of priſoners, that the offi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cers may not leave Boſton till the reſult is known.</p>
                  <p>With reſpect to major De Paſſern of the regiment of Heſſe-Hanau, I hope he may be releaſed by an exchange; after which, it will remain with him to obtain liberty from ſir Henry Clinton to return to Europe. But if the exchange in agitation ſhould not take place, I ſhould be happy if Congreſs themſelves would decide whether he is to be allowed his requeſt.—If on my per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion he ſhould go to Europe without application to and the conſent of the Britiſh commander (which ſeems to be his inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion), the enemy might not think themſelves bound upon a fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture occaſion to account for him.</p>

                  <p>I HAVE the honor to addreſs you by command of his excellency, who went from this place at four o'clock this morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in conſequence of advice received laſt night that fifty-two veſſels great and ſmall, including a bomb-ketch, with troops on board, had the day before yeſterday, moved up the North-river

                  <p>When he left Peekſkill, the two Maſſachuſetts brigades, on their march thither from Hartford, were not arrived, ſo that the troops on the ſpot were only the original garriſon of Weſt-Point, and Nixon's brigade which lay near the Continental Village: but, without the moſt inexplicable delay, thoſe muſt have reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their deſtination ſome days ſince. If ſo, and the enemy ſhould meditate a ſtroke againſt Weſt-Point, they will probably fail in it unleſs there ſhould be ſomething like a ſurpriſe.—The general alſo thinks it probable that the Maryland diviſion were yeſterday evening at the Clove. Their inſtructions were, to communicate with Weſt-Point and reinforce it on any emergency. They were, in addition to them, directed laſt night by expreſs to move immediately towards the forts, diveſted of baggage and artillery, for the more ſpeedy communication.—The Carolina brigade has been ſome time ſtationed at the entrance of the Clove.</p>
                  <p>One brigade of the Virginia troops is at Pompton, and the other two were expected to reach Springfield yeſterday. The Pennſylvania troops, it is ſuppoſed, would be at Acquakenunk or in the neighborhood of Paramus.—Theſe troops, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately on receiving the preſent intelligence, were ordered to halt; and his excellency is gone forward to regulate their movements according to circumſtances.—The brigade in this town is order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to hold itſelf in readineſs.</p>
                  <p>If the convention troops ſhould be their object, 'tis probable the attempt will be too late to anſwer any purpoſe: the rear di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion was to croſs the North-river on wedneſday laſt, but muſt certainly have done it on thurſday; the front muſt be not far from the Delaware; and the whole too far advanced to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to a riſque. Added to this, there is a pretty ſtrong guard with each diviſion. His excellency however has ſent on the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence to colonel Bland who directs their march, urging him to haſten them forward with all poſſible diſpatch.</p>
                  <p>One brigade of Connecticut troops was at Danbury, the other at Fredericſburg, when we came away; and general Poor's was in full march for the former, and muſt long ſince have arrived.</p>

                  <p>I HAD the honor of receiving yours of the ſecond at this place.—I have forwarded the brevet to captain Simonet; and ſhall take ſuch meaſures in regard to colonel Fleury's letter as ſhall ſeem proper, upon my arrival at Middlebrook for which I ſhall ſet out again to-morrow.</p>
                  <p>Upon leaving Elizabethtown I directed colonel Harriſon to inform you of the intelligence I had received, and which I thought demanded my perſonal attention, as the enemy appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be going up the river in conſiderable force. Having put the troops deſtined for the Middlebrook cantonment upon their march back towards the North-river, I was proceeding that way myſelf when an expreſs met me a few miles from this, informing me that the enemy's ſhipping, which had been as high as King's ferry, had fallen down again. They landed a party at the fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and ſet fire to a few ſmall buildings near the water: but, upon a party of ours advancing, they immediately [<hi>re-embarked.</hi>] without attempting any thing further.—The boats and ſtores of every kind had been previouſly ſecured—I cannot account for this manoenvre but by ſuppoſing that they had been miſinformed as to the quantity of ſtores at the ferry, or that they expected to find the poſts in a defenceleſs ſituation; or it may perhaps have been to favor a forage below.</p>
                  <p>Finding that the troops deſtined for the defence of the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands had arrived at their reſpective poſts agreeable to my or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and expectations, I have again put thoſe intended for Mid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dlebrook into motion; and I hope they will arrive there while the roads and weather are both fine.</p>
                  <p>Accounts from New-York through a good channel inform me that thirty thouſand tons of ſhipping had been ſuddenly tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en up for government ſervice, and that a general embargo is laid. The occaſion has not yet tranſpired; at leaſt it has not yet reached me.—</p>

                  <p>IT has not been in my power to return an anſwer to your favor of the ſixth inſtant till now. The letter met me on the road, ſeparated from my papers; and I did not reach this place till late on the eleventh, ſince which I have been much employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in attending to the diſpoſitions for hutting the army: but in the mean time the objects of the diſpatch have engaged my ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt attention.</p>
                  <p>The earneſt deſire I have to pay the ſtricteſt compliance in every inſtance with the views and inſtructions of Congreſs can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but make me feel the greateſt uneaſineſs when I find my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in circumſtances of heſitation or doubt with reſpect to their directions. But the perfect confidence I have in the juſtice and candor of that honorable body emboldens me to communicate without reſerve the difficulties which occur in the execution of their preſent order; and the indulgence I have experienced on every former occaſion induces me to imagine that the liberty I now take will not meet with their diſapprobation.</p>
                  <p>I have attentively taken up the report of the committee of the fifth (approved by Congreſs) on the ſubject of my letter of the eleventh ultimo on the propoſed expedition into Canada: I have conſidered it in ſeveral lights, and ſincerely regret that I ſhould feel myſelf under any embarraſſment in carrying it into execution. Still I remain of opinion, from a general review of things and the ſtate of our reſources, that no extenſive ſyſtem of co-operation with the French, for the complete emancipation of Canada, can be poſitively decided on for the enſuing year.—To propoſe a plan of perfect co-operation with a foreign power with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a moral certainty in our ſupplies, and to have that plan ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually ratified with the court of Verſailles, might be attended, in caſe of failure in the conditions on our part, with very fatal effects.</p>
                  <p>If I ſhould ſeem unwilling to tranſmit the plan as prepared by Congreſs, with my obſervations, it is becauſe I find myſelf under a neceſſity (in order to give our miniſter ſufficient ground to found an application on) to propoſe ſomething more than a vague and indeciſive plan, which, even in the event of a total evacuation of theſe ſtates by the enemy, may be rendered im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable in the execution by a variety of inſurmountable <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

                     </gap> or if I retain my preſent ſentiments and act conſiſtently.
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:031423_0605_0FEC60A185E7BBE8"/>
I muſt point out the difficulties as they appear to me; which muſt embarraſs his negotiations, and may diſappoint the views of Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>But proceeding on the idea of the enemy's leaving theſe ſtates before the active part of the enſuing campaign, I ſhould fear to hazard a miſtake as to the preciſe aim and extent of the views of Congreſs. The line of conduct that I am to obſerve in writing to our miniſter at the court of France does not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſufficiently delineated:—were I to undertake it, I ſhould be much afraid of erring through miſconception. In this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemma I would eſteem it a particular favor to be excuſed from writing at all on the ſubject, eſpecially as it is the part of can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor in me to acknowledge that I do not ſee my way clear e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to point out ſuch a plan for co-operation as I conceive to be conſiſtent with the ideas of Congreſs, and that will be ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently explanatory with reſpect to time and circumſtances, to give efficacy to the meaſure. But if congreſs ſtill think it ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for me to proceed in the buſineſs, I muſt requeſt their more definitive and explicit inſtructions, and that they will per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit me, previous to tranſmitting the intended diſpatches, to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit them to their determination.</p>
                  <p>I could wiſh to lay before Congreſs more minutely the ſtate of the army, the condition of our ſupplies, and the requiſites ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for carrying into execution an undertaking that may in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve the moſt ſerious events. If Congreſs think this can be done more ſatisfactorily in a perſonal conference, I hope to have the army in ſuch a ſituation before I can receive their anſwer, as to afford me an opportunity of giving my attendance.—I would on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly add that I ſhall cheerfully comply with the directions of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs relative to making every preparation in our power for an expedition againſt Niagara, and for ſuch further operations to the northward as time and circumſtances ſhall enable us to carry on. Meaſures for the purpoſe have been taken in part for ſome time paſt; and I ſhall purſue them vigorouſly. The ſubject has long engaged my contemplation; and I am thoroughly convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of the expediency and policy of doing every thing practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble on our part, for giving ſecurity to our frontiers by the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of thoſe places which facilitate annoying them, and even for accompliſhing the annexation of Canada to the Union.—</p>

                  <p>IN a letter which I had the honor of receiving from Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, dated the ſecond inſtant, was incloſed the copy of one from lieutenant-colonel Fleury, upon the ſubject of which, the preſident deſired me to expreſs "my ſentiments, as alſo of the merits of Mr. Fleury during his ſervices in the army."</p>
                  <p>I do not conceive that Congreſs ſhould requeſt a renewal of colonel Fleury's furlough from the French miniſter plenipoten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiary. An application of that kind ought, in my opinion, to be made by himſelf, not only becauſe it is cuſtomary, but becauſe ſolicitations of a ſimilar nature would in all probability be made by many not having Mr. Fleury's claim to the favor of the public, and to whom it would be difficult to give a refuſal after a precedent had been eſtabliſhed. I would not be under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood to include the caſe of general Du Portail and the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men in the engineering department, who are peculiarly cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtanced, and in whoſe behalf I have written particularly to Congreſs.</p>
                  <p>As to Mr. Fleury's merits as an officer, I can only repeat what I have upon ſeveral occaſions mentioned to Congreſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore,—that he is brave, active, and intelligent, and that, ſhould he obtain leave to remain in America, I ſhall take an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity (agreeable to my promiſe to him) of employing him in a manner ſuitable to his rank, and in ſuch a way as will not claſh with the officers of the line.</p>

                  <p>SINCE I had the honor of addreſſing you on the thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth, the gentlemen appointed to meet commiſſioners from ſir Henry Clinton have returned to camp. Your excellency will find, by a copy of their report, No. 7, (which, with the other papers reſpecting the meeting, is incloſed) that an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of priſoners has not taken place.</p>
                  <p>As an exchange has not been effected, and ſir Henry Clin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton has called for all our officers on parole, I ſhall, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the reſolution of the nineteenth ultimo, order the commiſſary of priſoners to require the immediate return of the

convention and any other officers with the enemy on parole. I do not mean however to include general Burgoyne in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand unleſs Congreſs ſhould direct it, as there appears to me many political reaſons for permitting him to remain in Britain in his preſent temper. But if Congreſs ſhould differ from me in opinion on this point, I ſhall be happy to be informed, that meaſures may be purſued for his recal.</p>

                  <p>I HAD the honor of addreſſing Congreſs ſome time ſince on the ſubject of general Du Portail and the gentlemen with him. He informs me that his affair has not yet been decided, and is extremely anxious that it ſhould be in ſome way or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. He aſſigns many powerful reaſons to ſhew that it is very intereſting to him (if he is not to continue in our ſervice) to return to France as ſpeedily as poſſible. He alſo informs me that he has reaſon to think, in the conſideration of his affair, the retaining him in ſervice and the adopting the plan propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his memoir are united, and the deciſion of the one ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on that of the other; and has therefore requeſted me to repreſent to Congreſs that he ſhould be happy they could be conſidered ſeparately; and if his ſervices, abſtractedly from the project propoſed by him, are deemed neceſſary, it will be agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him to remain in the country.</p>
                  <p>I have already taken the liberty to offer my ſentiments on the propriety of engaging theſe gentlemen to continue in the ſervice. It really appears to me that they will be eſſentially neceſſary to our future operations, whether defenſive or offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; and it cannot therefore but give me pleaſure if it ſhall be conſiſtent with the views of Congreſs to retain them, and to give every encouragement which they may reaſonably expect.</p>
