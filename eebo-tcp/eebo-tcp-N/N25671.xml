            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <head>THE WAY TO MAKE MONEY PLENTY IN EVERY MAN's POCKET.</head>
               <p>AT this time, when the general complaint is that—"Money is ſcarce," it will be an act of kindneſs to inform the moneyleſs how they may reinforce their pockets. I will acquaint them with the true ſecret
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:034092_0004_0FFA58C16B35A158"/>
of money-catching—the certain way to fill empty pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes—and how to keep them always full. Two ſimple rules-well obſerved, will do the buſineſs.</p>
               <p>Firſt, let honeſty and induſtry be thy conſtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; and,</p>
               <p>Secondly, ſpend one penny leſs than thy clear gains.</p>
               <p>Then ſhall thy hide bound pocket ſoon begin to thrive, and will never again cry with the empty belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache: neither will creditors inſult thee, nor want op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs, nor hunger bite, nor nakedneſs freeze thee.</p>
               <p>The whole hemiſphere will ſhine brighter, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſpring up in every corner of thy heart. Now therefore, embrace theſe rules and be happy. Baniſh the bleak winds of ſorrow from thy mind, and live in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant. Then ſhalt thou be a man, and not hide thy face at the approach of the rich, nor ſuffer the pain of feeling little when the ſons of fortune walk at thy right hand: for indepednency, whether with little or much, is good fortune, and placeth thee on even ground with the proudeſt of the golden fleece. Oh then, be wiſe, and let induſtry walk with thee in the morning, and attend thee untill thou reacheſt the eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning hour for reſt. Let honeſty be as the breath of thy ſoul, and never forget to have a penny when all thy expenſes are enumerated and paid: then ſhalt thou
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:034092_0005_0FFA57B3A28641C0"/>
reach the point of happineſs, and independance ſhall be thy ſhield and buckler, thy helmet and crown; then ſhall thy ſoul walk upright, nor ſtooop to the ſilken wretch becauſe he hath riches, nor pocket an abuſe becauſe the hand which offers it wears a ring ſet with diamonds.</p>

               <head>THE WHISTLE. A TRUE STORY.</head>
               <p>WHen I was a child, at ſeven years old, my friends on a holiday filled my pockets with coppers, I went directly to a ſhop where they ſold toys for children; and being charmed with the ſound of a whiſtle, that I met by the way in the hands of another boy, I vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily offered him all my money for one. I then came home, and went whiſtling all over the houſe, much pleaſed with my whiſtle, but diſturbing all the family, my brothers and ſiſters, and couſins, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the bargain I had made, told me I had given four times as much for it as it was worth. This put me in mind what good things I might have bought with the reſt of my money; and they laughed at me ſo much for my folly that I cried with vexation; and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the whiſtle gave me pleaſure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:034092_0006_0FFA58CE4DB36688"/>
This however was afterwards of uſe to me, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions continuing on my mind; ſo that often when I was tempted to buy ſome unneceſſary thing, I ſaid to myſelf don't give too much for the whiſtle; and ſo I ſaved my money.</p>
               <p>As I grew up, came into the world, and obſerved the actions of men, I thought I met with many, very many, who gave too much for the whiſtle.</p>
               <p>When I ſaw any one too ambitious of court favours, ſacrifice his time in attendance on levees, his repoſe, his liberty, his virtue, and perhaps his friends to attain it, I have ſaid to myſelf, this man gives too much for his whiſtle.</p>
               <p>When I ſaw another fond of popularity, conſtantly employing himſelf in political buſtles, neglecting his own affairs, and ruining them by that neglect: he pays indeed, ſays I, too much for his whiſtle.</p>
               <p>If I knew a miſer, who gave up every kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable living, all the pleaſure of doing good to others, all the eſteem of his fellow citizens, and the joys of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent friendſhip, for the ſake of accumulating wealth: poor man ſays I, you do indeed pay too much for your whiſtle.</p>
               <p>If I fee one fond of fine clothing, fine furniture, fine equipage, and above his fortune, for which he contracts debts, and ends his career in priſon, alas, ſay I, he pays dear, very dear, for his whiſtle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:034092_0007_0FFA57C529089F98"/>
When I ſee a beautiful, ſweet tempered, girl married to an ill-natured brute of a huſband: what a pity it is, ſays I, that ſhe has paid ſo much for a whiſtle.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, I concieve, that great part of the miſeries of mankind were brought upon them by the falſe eſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates they had made of the value of things, and by their giving too much for their whiſtle.</p>

               <p>I could wiſh that men, while they are in the health, would conſider well the nature of the part they are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in, and what figure it will make in the minds of thoſe they leave behind them: whether it was worth coming into the world for; whether it be ſuitable to a reaſonable being; in ſhort, whether it appears grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in this life, or will turn to advantage in the next. Let the ſycophant, or buffoon, the ſatiriſt,
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:034092_0008_0FFA5573A047F250"/>
or the good companion, conſider with himſelf, when his body ſhall be laid in the grave: and his ſoul paſs in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another ſtate of exiſtence, how much it would re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dound to his praiſe to have it ſaid of him, that no man in England eat better, that he had an admirable talent at turning his friends into ridicule, that no body out<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> did him at an-ill-natured jeſt, or that he never went to bed before he had diſpatched his third bottle.</p>
               <p>Theſe are, however, very common funeral orations, and elogiums on deceaſed perſons who have acted a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong mankind with ſome figure and reputation. But if we look into the bulk of our ſpecies, there are ſuch as are not likely to be remembered a moment after their diſappearance. They leave behind them no tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of their exiſtence, but are forgotten as though they had never been. They are neither wanted by the poor, regretted by the rich, nor celebrated by the learned. They are neither miſſed in the common-wealth, nor la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented by private perſons.</p>
               <p>Their actions are of no ſignificancy to mankind, and might have been performed by creatures of much leſs dignity than thoſe who are diſtinguiſhed by the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of reaſon. An eminent French author ſpeaks ſomewhere to the following purpoſe; I have often ſeen from my chamber-window two noble creatures, both of them of an erect countenance, and endowed with

               <p>My friend, Sir Andrew Freeport, as we were ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the club laſt night, gave us an account of a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber citizen, who died a few days ſince. This honeſt man being of greater conſequence in his own thoughts than in the eye of the world, had for ſome years paſt kept a journal of his life. Sir Andrew, ſhowed us one week of it. Since the occurrences ſet down in it mark out ſuch a road of action as that I have been ſpeaking of, I ſhall preſent my readers with a faithful copy of it; after having firſt informed him, that the deceaſed perſon had in his youth been bred to trade, but finding himſelf not ſo well turned for buſineſs, he had for ſeveral years paſt lived altogether upon a mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate annuity.</p>

I queſtion not but the readers will be ſurpriſed to find the above-mentioned journaliſt taking ſo much care of a life that was filled with ſuch inconſiderable actions, and received ſo very ſmall improvements; and yet, if we look into the behavior of many whom we daily converſe with, we ſhall find moſt of our hours are taken up in thoſe three important articles of eating, drinking and ſleeping.</p>
               <p>I do not ſuppoſe that a man loſes his time, who is not engaged in public affairs, or in an illuſtrious courſe of action. On the contrary, I believe our hours may very often be more profitably laid out in ſuch tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as make no figure in the world, than in ſuch as are apt to draw upon them the attention of mankind. One may become wiſer and better by ſeveral methods of employing ones-ſelf in ſecrecy and ſilence, and do what is laudable without noiſe or oſtentation. I would, however, recommend to every one of my read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the keeping a journal of their lives for one week, and ſetting down punctually their whole ſeries of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments during that ſpace of time.</p>
               <p>This kind of Self examination would give them a true ſtate of themſelves, and incline them to conſider ſeriouſly what they are about. One day would rectify the miſtakes of another, and make a man weigh all thoſe indifferent actions, which, though they are eaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er forgotten, muſt certainly be accounted for.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>SINCE you have entertained your readers with ſeveral curious pieces, which refer to nature and art, I doubt not, but the ſubſequent paſſages of thoſe perpetual lamps which have continued burning (in the ſepulchres of the Ancients) for many centuries to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, without any freſh ſupply, will prove acceptable.</p>
               <p>All fire, but eſpecially flame, ſays philoſophers is of an active and ſtirring nature, and cannot poſſibly ſubſiſt without motion: Now there are ſeveral au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors who have treated of this ſubject by the by, tho' none, ſays the learned and judicious Biſhop Wilkins, that have writ any thing to the purpoſe, (except the ingenious Fortunius Licetus) from whom we ſhall beg leave to borrow ſome undeniable proofs, which we hope will be ſuitable to our preſent enquiry.</p>
               <p>Firſt then that there hath been ſuch lamps, St. Auſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin mentions one of them in a temple dedicated to Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus which was alway expoſed to the open weather, and could never be extinguiſhed; Pamyrollus mentions a lamp found in his time, in the ſepulchre of Tulli<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>, Cicero's daughter, which had continued there for 1550 years, but was preſently extinguiſhed by the admiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:034092_0015_0FFA57F7C4B95DA8"/>
of new air. And 'tis commonly reported of Ced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus, that in Juſtinian's time there was another burning lamp found in an old wall at Antioch; which had remained for above 500 years, there being a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix placed by it; hence it appears, that they were in uſe with the primitive Chriſtians.</p>
               <p>But more eſpecially remarkable is that of Olybius, which had continued burning for 1500 years: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is this: "As a ruſtic was digging the ground by Padua, he found an urn, in which there was another urn, and in this a leſſer, with a lamp clearly burning; on each ſide of it there were two other veſſels, both of them full of a pure liquor the one of gold, the other of ſilver". Hence we may probably conjecture, that it was ſome chemical ſecret by which it was contrived. Baptiſta Porta, tells us of another lamp, burning in an old marble ſepulchre belonging to ſome of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Romans, encloſed in a glaſs vial, found in his time, about the year 1550, in the Iſb Niſis which had been buried there before our Savior's incarnation.</p>
               <p>In the tomb of Pallas the Areadian, who was ſlain by Turnus in the Trojan war, there was found another burning lamp.</p>
               <p>In the year of our Lord 1401, whence it would ſeem that it had continued there for above 2600 years; and being taken out, it continued burning, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding either wind or water, with which ſome
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:034092_0016_0FFA58FFC8D72730"/>
ſtrove to quench it, nor could it be extinguiſhed till they had ſpilt the liquor in it. Ludouicus Vives tells us of another lamp that continued burning for 1050 years, which was found a little before his time. There is another relation of a certain man, who, upon dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſomewhat deep in the ground, met with ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a door, having a wall on each hand of it, from which he cleared the earth; he farved open the door, and there diſcovered a fair vault, toward the farther ſide of which was the ſtatue of a man in armour, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>iting by a table, leaning upon his left arm, and holding a ſceptre in his right hand, with a lamp burning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; the floor of this vault being ſo contrived, that upon the firſt ſtep into it, the ſtatute erected it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from its leaning poſture, upon the ſecond ſtep, it lifted up the ſceptre to ſtrike, and before the man could approach near the lamp, to take hold of it, the ſtatute ſtruck and broke it to pieces; ſuch care was had that it might not be taken away, nor diſcovered; and the learned and judicious Mr. Cambden, in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription of Yorkſhire, page, 572, ſpeaking of the tomb of Conſtantius Clorus, broken up in thoſe times, mentions ſuch a lamp to be found within it.</p>
               <p>It is evident that there are ſeveral other relations to this purpoſe, beſides theſe above mentioned, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding the oppoſite opinions of our adverſaries, by which it clearly appears that there have been ſuch
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:034092_0017_0FFA1B5CD706AF10"/>
lamps which have remained burning for ſeveral cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies together, &amp;c, and there are ſeveral opinions why the Ancients were ſo careful in preſerving them, ſome of which we ſhall here exhibit.</p>
               <p>1ſt. Some think it to be an expreſſion of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, concerning the ſoul's immortality after its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of the body; a lamp among the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians being the hyerogliphick of life: and therefore that they that could not procure ſuch lamps, were yet careful to have the image and repreſentation of them engraved upon their tombs. Others conceive them by way of gratitude to thoſe infernal deities, who took the charge and cuſtody of their body's when dead, remaining always with them in their tombs, and were therefore called Dii Manes.</p>
               <p>Others, that theſe lamps were only intended to make their ſepulchres more pleaſant, that they may not ſeem to be impriſoned in a diſmal and uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble place. True indeed! a dead body cannot be ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the light, no more could it of it's want of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial; yet the ſame inſtinct which did excite it to the deſire of one, did alſo occaſion the other.</p>
               <p>Licetus concludes this ancient cuſtom to have a double end; 1ſt. politick, for the diſtinction of ſuch as were noble-born; hence it was uſual for the nobles amongſt the romans, to take ſpecial care in their laſt wills, that they might have a lamp in their own monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:034092_0018_0FFA1BE2699416B8"/>
and for that purpoſe gave liberty to their ſlaves on this condition, that they ſhould be watchful in maintaining and preſerving it. <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>d. Natural, to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the body from darkneſs;—of which tho' there have been ſo many ſundry kinds; and ſeveral ways to make them, (ſome being able to reſiſt any violence of weathers, others being eaſily extinguiſhed by any little alteration of the air, ſome being encloſed round about with glaſs, others being open,) yet they are all of them utterly periſhed amongſt the ruins of Time, and thoſe who are verſed in the ſearch after them, have only recovered ſuch dark conjectures, as are generally rejected and diſbelieved by the litterati of a brighter age; So I ſhall ſay no more on this head, but conclude with that of the poet, <abbr>viz,</abbr>

                  <hi>The Protector's advice to ALGERNON SIDNEY</hi> Communicated by Dr. Rawlinſon. (A very important article from the ſtudent.)</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>The following curious anecdote was found indorſed on paper ſigned Alg.</hi> Sidney.</p>
               <p>The Protector's advice to me, when I went from him to the King of Sweden in Poland; which I write from his own detailing, and the alteration in the ſecond particular is his own hand.</p>
               <p>I. IF you would not miſcarry in this buſineſs, know firſt, that all publique buſineſſes<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and private too, proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and ſucceed only as God is pleaſed to determine them.</p>
               <p>II. And that therefore the greateſt wiſdom in them that are employed about buſineſſe lies in this, that they ſeek to be accepted with God, which no man is, but by Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
               <p>III. That there be a denial of mans own abilities, and that work be undertaken with humility and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of ſpirit, and that one be ſwift to hear, and ſlow to ſpeak, well underſtanding before he anſwer.</p>
               <p>IV. That a man in his own converſations, as he would have a bleſſing, abſtaine from all manner of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil, and conſtantly, with all earneſtneſs and truth of heart, crye to God for a bleſſing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeeing he diſpoſes the iſſue of things all buſineſſes as he pleaſes.</p>

my abſolute retreat from all the polite and modiſh part of ſociety, when you requeſt from me a detail of my ſolitary amuſements; no one ſhould exact a more ſevere ſatisfaction: but, as I have no reaſon to queſtion your former friendſhip, I ſhall, with my uſual undiſguiſed openneſs, lay before you my manner of life, and how it is agreeable to one of my years, worn out with the fatigues of the ſtate, and cloy'd with the ways of the world.</p>
               <p>I never was ſo ſenſible of my own dignity; abſtract from buſineſs or diverſion, my mind retires within it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, where it finds treaſures, till now, undiſcovered; capacities formed for infinite objects, deſires that ſtretch themſelves beyond the limits of this wide crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in ſearch of the great Original of life and pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure. I muſt tell you my Lord, that I find new pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers exerting their energy, and employed in ſuch exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, to which, till now, I have been a ſtranger.—How oft have You and I rallied the remembrance of our religious duties, and put his ſacred truths on a level with the poet's roſy bowers, myrtle ſhades and elyſſian fields? But now I am convinced, that the ſoil is immortal and capable of celeſtial joys, and triumph in the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges of my own being;—I rejoice to think, that the moment I began to exiſt, I entered on an eternal ſtate, and commenced a duration, that ſhall run paralel to that of the ſupreme and ſelf-exiſtent mind.—This proſpect ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:034092_0022_0FFA591902006F98"/>
me with a divine ambition, and caſts a reproach on all created glory, which we have been ſo long and ſo anxiouſly looking after. The world vaniſheth; it's charms and ſoft allurements are no more; a vail is caſt on mortal beauty; the ſpell is broken, the enchantment diſſolved, and though I am every where ſurrounded with cauſeleſs enemies, nothing gives me ſo great trouble as the loſs of ſo much time ſpent in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit of periſhable objects. Perchance you may ſmile, and take this for an imaginary triumph, or ſort of cowardly inſult, in the abſence of an enemy: and may think my contempt of grandeur appears with an ill grace, in one that enjoys a conſiderable eſtate, a grand equipage, and many other tokens of his ſovreign favour, for the ſervices done to his king and country.</p>
               <p>But this, my lord, is what has given me a juſt opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the world, and of myſelf: a conſtant ſeries of ſucceſs and proſperity, has convinced me, that the whole creation cannot make me bleſſed. My ambitious deſigns have never been diſappointed: I have been ſo vain to apply to my own power that awful ſentence By me kings reign.—In love I have always been fortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate. But whatever pleaſure I purſued, the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment always undecieved me, or diſguſted me.—Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times I was too wiſe, ſometimes too capricious to be pleaſed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>—I have tried all the vanities below the ſun; and there is leſt no novelty to flatter me. I know the

utmoſt that beauty and greatneſs can give, and am cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red of love and ambition by experimental evidence.</p>
               <p>Your Lordſhip has been witneſs to many of thoſe truths which I recollect in this ſeat of retirement. You cannot forget Euſtatia; the admired Euſtatia, in whoſe poſſeſſions my youthful days promiſed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves laſting joys.—How did I adore her! You can tell with what eagerneſs and anxiety I purſued her virtue. But her yielding beauty, by granting my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires, loſt my eſteem; her charms vaniſhed, her wit was impertinance, and her artifice diſguſted me: and this, in a great meaſure, put a period to my gallantries.—</p>
               <p>I could thence forward look upon women, without any temptation to idolatry.—Balls and aſſemblies, dancing and dreſs, were no longer the ſubject of my ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious application: and I yielded an implicit aſſent to thoſe petit maitres, whoſe talents lie in diſcuſſing the important controverſies, who ſings beſt at the opera' performs beſt at the play-houſes, entertains us more a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably at Vauxhall and Ranelagh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or who ſupplies the town beſt with Maſquerade dreſſes, when they are aſhamed to turn fools in their uſual habit.</p>
               <p>But theſe ſoft follies were only diſcarded for more ſpacious vanities.—Diſtinction and power.—Titles and equipage now fill my thoughts—Ambition now took full poſſeſſion of my ſoul—I clothed myſelf with pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riotiſm<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and as the circumſtances of the times con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned with my ſcheme, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               <p>Forſaken by my patriot friends, I found myſelf ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with flatterers and mercenary dependants; and my ſleep, as well as my daily attendance on the ſtate, diſturbed with courtiers, diſpatches, intrigues of the cab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inet, and outcries of a diſcontented people loading me with the blame of thoſe evils, which you are ſenſible would never have fallen upon them, had my moderate and more wholeſome opinion been approved—My diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſcontent under theſe vexations, was grown almoſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable; and indeed, I muſt very ſoon have been borne down under ſuch a weight, had not kind prov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>idence releaſed me; and made my enemies the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of doing me that good, which I was not able to do for myſelf. It was a happy coalition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> my Lord, that ſet me free, and took the burthen upon their own ſhoulders.—What advantage they have got by it. I know not:—For my own part, I have gained a joyous retreat<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſurrounded with a charming variety of woods o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen lawns<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſlow'ry vales in their uncultivated beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty.

               <p>JUDGMENT is the throne of prudence, and ſilence is its ſanctury. It is a maxim of prudence to leave things before they leave us. The true way to advance another's virtue, is to follow it; and the beſt way to decry down another's vice, is to decline it. A warm heart requires a cool head. Courage without conduct,
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:034092_0031_0FFA585D0FED7420"/>
is, like fancy without judgment; all <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ail, and no ballaſt. Put a bridle on thy tongue; ſet a guard before thy lips, leſt the words of thine own mouth deſtroy thy peace.</p>
               <p>Boaſt not of thyſelf, for it ſhall bring contempt up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thee, neither deride another for it is dangerous.</p>
               <p>A bitter jeſt is the poiſon of friendſhip, and he that cannot reſtrain his tonge; ſhall have trouble.</p>
               <p>Furniſh thyſelf with the proper accommodations be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to thy condition but ſpend not the utmoſt of what thou canſt afford, that the providence of thy youth may be a comfort to thy old age. Let not proſperity put out the eyes of circumſpection, nor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance cut off the hands of frugality, he that too much indulges in the ſuperfluities of life, ſhall live to lament the want of it's neceſſaries. From the expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience of others do thou learn wiſdom, and from their failings correct thine own faults. Charity obliges not to miſtruſt a man, prudence not to truſt him before we know him.</p>
               <p>When thou haſt proved a man to be honeſt, look him up in thine heart as a treaſure, regard him as a jewel of ineſtimable value.</p>
               <p>Refuſe the favours of a mercenary man, they will be a ſnare unto thee, thou ſhalt never be quit of the obligation. Uſe not to day what to-morrow may
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:034092_0032_0FFA594020F64738"/>
want; neither leave that to hazard which foreſight may provide for, or can prevent.</p>
               <p>Yet expect not even from prudence infallible ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs; for the day knoweth not what the night may bring forth.</p>
               <p>The fool is not always unfortunate, nor the wiſe man always ſucceſsful.</p>

               <head>FORTITUDE.</head>
               <p>PERILS, miſfortunes, pain, and injury, are more or leſs the lot of every man that cometh into the world.</p>
               <p>In human life there is a conſtant change of fortune, and it is unreaſonable to expect from the common fate. Life itſelf decays, and all things are daily on the change.</p>
               <p>Imprint this maxim deeply in your mind, that there is nothing certain in this human and mortal ſtate; by which means you will avoid being tranſported with proſperity and being dejected in adverſity.</p>
               <p>A wiſe man ſtands firm in all extremities, and bears the lot of his humanity with a divine temper.</p>
               <p>He ſuffers not his happineſs to depend on her ſmiles, and with her frowns he will not be diſmayed.</p>
               <p>Under the preſſure of his misfortunes, his calmneſs alleviates their weight, and his conſtancy ſhall ſurmount them.</p>
               <p>A peaceful conſcience honeſt thoughts, virtuous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and an indifference for caſual events, are bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:034092_0033_0FFA58702A79E2D8"/>
without end or meaſure; this conſummate ſtate of felicity is a ſubmiſſion to the dictates of right nature; the foundation of its wiſdom and virtue; the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of what we ought do, and the conformity of the will to that knowledge. Every virtue gives a man a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of felicity in ſome kind: honeſty gives a man a good report; juſtice, eſtimation; prudence, reſpect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> courteſy and liberallity, affection; temperence, gives health; fortitude, a quiet mind, not to be moved by any adverſity.</p>
               <p>Virtue is a bleſſing, which man alone poſſeſſes, and no other creature has any title to but himſelf. All is nothing without her, and ſhe alone is all. The other bleſſings of this life, are often times imaginary: She is always real—She is the life and crown of all perfections.</p>
