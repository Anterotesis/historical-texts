            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>AT this time, when the general complaint is that‚Äî"Money is ≈øcarce," it will be an act of kindne≈øs to inform the moneyle≈øs how they may reinforce their pockets. I will acquaint them with the true ≈øecret

of money-catching‚Äîthe certain way to fill empty pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes‚Äîand how to keep them always full. Two ≈øimple rules-well ob≈øerved, will do the bu≈øine≈øs.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt, let hone≈øty and indu≈øtry be thy con≈øtant com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions; and,</p>
               <p>Secondly, ≈øpend one penny le≈øs than thy clear gains.</p>
               <p>Then ≈øhall thy hide bound pocket ≈øoon begin to thrive, and will never again cry with the empty belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ache: neither will creditors in≈øult thee, nor want op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs, nor hunger bite, nor nakedne≈øs freeze thee.</p>
               <p>The whole hemi≈øphere will ≈øhine brighter, and plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure ≈øpring up in every corner of thy heart. Now therefore, embrace the≈øe rules and be happy.

Then ≈øhalt thou be a man, and not hide thy face at the approach of the rich, nor ≈øuffer the pain of feeling little when the ≈øons of fortune walk at thy right hand: for indepednency, whether with little or much, is good fortune, and placeth thee on even ground with the proude≈øt of the golden fleece.

               <head>THE WHISTLE. A TRUE STORY.</head>
               <p>WHen I was a child, at ≈øeven years old, my friends on a holiday filled my pockets with coppers, I went directly to a ≈øhop where they ≈øold toys for children; and being charmed with the ≈øound of a whi≈øtle, that I met by the way in the hands of another boy, I vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntarily offered him all my money for one. I then came home, and went whi≈øtling all over the hou≈øe, much plea≈øed with my whi≈øtle, but di≈øturbing all the family, my brothers and ≈øi≈øters, and cou≈øins, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding the bargain I had made, told me I had given four times as much for it as it was worth. This put me in mind what good things I might have bought with the re≈øt of my money; and they laughed at me ≈øo much for my folly that I cried with vexation; and the reflection gave me more chagrin than the whi≈øtle gave me plea≈øure.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="unknown:034092_0006_0FFA58CE4DB36688"/>
This however was afterwards of u≈øe to me, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øions continuing on my mind; ≈øo that often when I was tempted to buy ≈øome unnece≈ø≈øary thing, I ≈øaid to my≈øelf don't give too much for the whi≈øtle; and ≈øo I ≈øaved my money.</p>
               <p>As I grew up, came into the world, and ob≈øerved the actions of men, I thought I met with many, very many, who gave too much for the whi≈øtle.</p>
               <p>When I ≈øaw any one too ambitious of court favours, ≈øacrifice his time in attendance on levees, his repo≈øe, his liberty, his virtue, and perhaps his friends to attain it, I have ≈øaid to my≈øelf, this man gives too much for his whi≈øtle.</p>
               <p>When I ≈øaw another fond of popularity, con≈øtantly employing him≈øelf in political bu≈øtles, neglecting his own affairs, and ruining them by that neglect: he pays indeed, ≈øays I, too much for his whi≈øtle.</p>
               <p>If I knew a mi≈øer, who gave up every kind of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable living, all the plea≈øure of doing good to others, all the e≈øteem of his fellow citizens, and the joys of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolent friend≈øhip, for the ≈øake of accumulating wealth: poor man ≈øays I, you do indeed pay too much for your whi≈øtle.</p>
               <p>If I fee one fond of fine clothing, fine furniture, fine equipage, and above his fortune, for which he contracts debts, and ends his career in pri≈øon, alas, ≈øay I, he pays dear, very dear, for his whi≈øtle.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:034092_0007_0FFA57C529089F98"/>
When I ≈øee a beautiful, ≈øweet tempered, girl married to an ill-natured brute of a hu≈øband: what a pity it is, ≈øays I, that ≈øhe has paid ≈øo much for a whi≈øtle.</p>
               <p>In ≈øhort, I concieve, that great part of the mi≈øeries of mankind were brought upon them by the fal≈øe e≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates they had made of the value of things, and by their giving too much for their whi≈øtle.</p>

               <p>My friend, Sir Andrew Freeport, as we were ≈øit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting in the club la≈øt night, gave us an account of a ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber citizen, who died a few days ≈øince. This hone≈øt man being of greater con≈øequence in his own thoughts than in the eye of the world, had for ≈øome years pa≈øt kept a journal of his life. Sir Andrew, ≈øhowed us one week of it. Since the occurrences ≈øet down in it mark out ≈øuch a road of action as that I have been ≈øpeaking of, I ≈øhall pre≈øent my readers with a faithful copy of it; after having fir≈øt informed him, that the decea≈øed per≈øon had in his youth been bred to trade, but finding him≈øelf not ≈øo well turned for bu≈øine≈øs, he had for ≈øeveral years pa≈øt lived altogether upon a mod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate annuity.</p>

I que≈øtion not but the readers will be ≈øurpri≈øed to find the above-mentioned journali≈øt taking ≈øo much care of a life that was filled with ≈øuch incon≈øiderable actions, and received ≈øo very ≈ømall improvements; and yet, if we look into the behavior of many whom we daily conver≈øe with, we ≈øhall find mo≈øt of our hours are taken up in tho≈øe three important articles of eating, drinking and ≈øleeping.</p>
               <p>I do not ≈øuppo≈øe that a man lo≈øes his time, who is not engaged in public affairs, or in an illu≈øtrious cour≈øe of action. On the contrary, I believe our hours may very often be more profitably laid out in ≈øuch tran≈øac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as make no figure in the world, than in ≈øuch as are apt to draw upon them the attention of mankind. One may become wi≈øer and better by ≈øeveral methods of employing ones-≈øelf in ≈øecrecy and ≈øilence, and do what is laudable without noi≈øe or o≈øtentation. I would, however, recommend to every one of my read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, the keeping a journal of their lives for one week, and ≈øetting down punctually their whole ≈øeries of em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments during that ≈øpace of time.</p>
               <p>This kind of Self examination would give them a true ≈øtate of them≈øelves, and incline them to con≈øider ≈øeriou≈øly what they are about. One day would rectify the mi≈øtakes of another, and make a man weigh all tho≈øe indifferent actions, which, though they are ea≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er forgotten, mu≈øt certainly be accounted for.</p>

               <p>SINCE you have entertained your readers with ≈øeveral curious pieces, which refer to nature and art, I doubt not, but the ≈øub≈øequent pa≈ø≈øages of tho≈øe perpetual lamps which have continued burning (in the ≈øepulchres of the Ancients) for many centuries to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, without any fre≈øh ≈øupply, will prove acceptable.</p>
               <p>All fire, but e≈øpecially flame, ≈øays philo≈øophers is of an active and ≈øtirring nature, and cannot po≈ø≈øibly ≈øub≈øi≈øt without motion: Now there are ≈øeveral au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors who have treated of this ≈øubject by the by, tho' none, ≈øays the learned and judicious Bi≈øhop Wilkins, that have writ any thing to the purpo≈øe, (except the ingenious Fortunius Licetus) from whom we ≈øhall beg leave to borrow ≈øome undeniable proofs, which we hope will be ≈øuitable to our pre≈øent enquiry.</p>
               <p>Fir≈øt then that there hath been ≈øuch lamps, St. Au≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tin mentions one of them in a temple dedicated to Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus which was alway expo≈øed to the open weather, and could never be extingui≈øhed; Pamyrollus mentions a lamp found in his time, in the ≈øepulchre of Tulli<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

of new air. And 'tis commonly reported of Ced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renus, that in Ju≈øtinian's time there was another burning lamp found in an old wall at Antioch; which had remained for above 500 years, there being a cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cifix placed by it; hence it appears, that they were in u≈øe with the primitive Chri≈øtians.</p>
               <p>But more e≈øpecially remarkable is that of Olybius, which had continued burning for 1500 years: the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation is this: "As a ru≈øtic was digging the ground by Padua, he found an urn, in which there was another urn, and in this a le≈ø≈øer, with a lamp clearly burning; on each ≈øide of it there were two other ve≈ø≈øels, both of them full of a pure liquor the one of gold, the other of ≈øilver". Hence we may probably conjecture, that it was ≈øome chemical ≈øecret by which it was contrived. Bapti≈øta Porta, tells us of another lamp, burning in an old marble ≈øepulchre belonging to ≈øome of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Romans, enclo≈øed in a gla≈øs vial, found in his time, about the year 1550, in the I≈øb Ni≈øis which had been buried there before our Savior's incarnation.</p>
               <p>In the tomb of Pallas the Areadian, who was ≈ølain by Turnus in the Trojan war, there was found another burning lamp.</p>
               <p>In the year of our Lord 1401, whence it would ≈øeem that it had continued there for above 2600 years; and being taken out, it continued burning, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>with≈øtanding either wind or water, with which ≈øome

≈øtrove to quench it, nor could it be extingui≈øhed till they had ≈øpilt the liquor in it. Ludouicus Vives tells us of another lamp that continued burning for 1050 years, which was found a little before his time. There is another relation of a certain man, who, upon dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øomewhat deep in the ground, met with ≈øome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like a door, having a wall on each hand of it, from which he cleared the earth; he farved open the door, and there di≈øcovered a fair vault, toward the farther ≈øide of which was the ≈øtatue of a man in armour, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>‚Ä¢</desc>
                  </gap>iting by a table, leaning upon his left arm, and holding a ≈øceptre in his right hand, with a lamp burning be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; the floor of this vault being ≈øo contrived, that upon the fir≈øt ≈øtep into it, the ≈øtatute erected it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf from its leaning po≈øture, upon the ≈øecond ≈øtep, it lifted up the ≈øceptre to ≈øtrike, and before the man could approach near the lamp, to take hold of it, the ≈øtatute ≈øtruck and broke it to pieces; ≈øuch care was had that it might not be taken away, nor di≈øcovered; and the learned and judicious Mr. Cambden, in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcription of York≈øhire, page, 572, ≈øpeaking of the tomb of Con≈øtantius Clorus, broken up in tho≈øe times, mentions ≈øuch a lamp to be found within it.</p>
               <p>It is evident that there are ≈øeveral other relations to this purpo≈øe, be≈øides the≈øe above mentioned, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding the oppo≈øite opinions of our adver≈øaries, by which it clearly appears that there have been ≈øuch

lamps which have remained burning for ≈øeveral cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turies together, &amp;c, and there are ≈øeveral opinions why the Ancients were ≈øo careful in pre≈øerving them, ≈øome of which we ≈øhall here exhibit.</p>
               <p>1≈øt. Some think it to be an expre≈ø≈øion of their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, concerning the ≈øoul's immortality after its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture out of the body; a lamp among the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians being the hyerogliphick of life: and therefore that they that could not procure ≈øuch lamps, were yet careful to have the image and repre≈øentation of them engraved upon their tombs. Others conceive them by way of gratitude to tho≈øe infernal deities, who took the charge and cu≈øtody of their body's when dead, remaining always with them in their tombs, and were therefore called Dii Manes.</p>
               <p>Others, that the≈øe lamps were only intended to make their ≈øepulchres more plea≈øant, that they may not ≈øeem to be impri≈øoned in a di≈ømal and uncomforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble place. True indeed! a dead body cannot be ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible of the light, no more could it of it's want of bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial; yet the ≈øame in≈øtinct which did excite it to the de≈øire of one, did al≈øo occa≈øion the other.</p>
               <p>Licetus concludes this ancient cu≈øtom to have a double end; 1≈øt. politick, for the di≈øtinction of ≈øuch as were noble-born; hence it was u≈øual for the nobles among≈øt the romans, to take ≈øpecial care in their la≈øt wills, that they might have a lamp in their own monu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,

               <p>The Protector's advice to me, when I went from him to the King of Sweden in Poland; which I write from his own detailing, and the alteration in the ≈øecond particular is his own hand.</p>

               <p>III. That there be a denial of mans own abilities, and that work be undertaken with humility and meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of ≈øpirit, and that one be ≈øwift to hear, and ≈ølow to ≈øpeak, well under≈øtanding before he an≈øwer.</p>

               <p>But this, my lord, is what has given me a ju≈øt opin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the world, and of my≈øelf: a con≈øtant ≈øeries of ≈øucce≈øs and pro≈øperity, has convinced me, that the whole creation cannot make me ble≈ø≈øed.
