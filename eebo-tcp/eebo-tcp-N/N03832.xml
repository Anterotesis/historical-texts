            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Matth. XIV. 12.</hi>
                  </bibl>
                  <p>And his Diſciples came and took up the Body and buried it, and went and told Jeſus.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>COncerning theſe Words I would obſerve three Things, 1. On what Occaſion that was, that we have an Account of in the Text; It was on Occaſion of the Death of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> who was a Perſon whoſe Buſineſs it had been to preach the Goſpel of the Kingdom of God; He was a Miniſter of Jeſus Chriſt, and had been impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to do great Service, was an Inſtrument of much good to many in <hi>Judea</hi> and <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> in his Life Time. He was cruelly murthered by <hi>Herod,</hi> at the Inſtigation of <hi>Herodias,</hi> having expoſed himſelf to her Malice by faithfully reproving them for their inceſtuous Wickedneſs.</p>
            <p n="2">2. We may obſerve who are the Perſons ſpoken of in the Text; they were thoſe that had been the Diſciples of <hi>John the Baptiſt,</hi> that had ſat at his Feet to hear him preach the Goſpel, that were his conſtant Followers, that were with him as thoſe that received great Benefit, by his Miniſtry, and were as it were his Children.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:004712_0003_100DC4599F5F7E80"/>3. We may obſerve their Behaviour on this Occaſion, conſiſting in two Things.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That whereby they ſhewed their Regard to the Remains of the deceaſed, <hi>They took up the Body and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it:</hi> It had been uſed in a barbarous Manner by others, that had alſo been his Hearers, and were under ſpecial Obligations to have treated him with Honour. They cruelly murder'd him, by ſevering his Head from his Body; and his Head was carried in a Charger to <hi>Herodias,</hi> that ſhe, inſtead of paying that Reſpect that was due to the Remains of ſo venerable a Perſon, might have her Malice and Cruelty gratified by ſuch a Specta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, and that ſhe might thence take Occaſion to inſult the Dead. While that Part of the dead Body was thus uſed by <hi>Herodias,</hi> his Diſciples out of Reſpect and Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to their Maſter and Teacher, decently inter the Reſt.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That which they did, conſequent on this, for God's Glory and their own Good, <hi>They went and told Jeſus.</hi> Him they knew to be one that their Maſter <hi>John,</hi> while he lived, had teſtified a great Regard to. <hi>Jeſus</hi> was he whoſe Forerunner <hi>John</hi> was; whom he had preach'd, and of whom he had ſaid, <hi>Behold the Lamb of God that taketh away the Sin of the World:</hi> And <hi>This is he, of whom I ſaid, after me cometh one that is preferred before me</hi>; and whom he ſaw, and bare Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord that <hi>this is the Son of God.</hi> And probably they knew that Chriſt was one that had put great Honour upon <hi>John</hi> their Teacher in his Life-time. For he, though he was the Son of God, and <hi>John</hi>'s Maker and Saviour, yet came to him to be baptized of him, and had ſaid of him, that <hi>among thoſe that were born of Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, there had not riſen a greater than John the Baptiſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was now a ſorrowful Time with <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples; when they were thus bereaved of him whoſe Teachings they had ſat under. And the Manner of his Death was doubtleſs very grievous to them. They were like a Company of ſorrowful, diſtreſſed, bereaved Children;
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004712_0004_100DC45CA7E39410"/>
and what do they do in their Sorrows, but go to <hi>Jeſus</hi> with their Complaint. The firſt Thing that they do, after paying proper Regards to the Remains of their dear Maſter, is to go to Chriſt, to ſpread their Caſe before him ſeeking Comfort and Help from him. <hi>Thus they ſought their own Benefit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And probably one End of their immediately going and telling Jeſus was, that he being informed of it, might conduct himſelf accordingly, as his Wiſdom ſhould direct, for the Intereſt of his own Kingdom. When ſo great a Perſon as <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi> the Forerunner of Chriſt was thus martyr'd, it was a great Event, in which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Cauſe, in which both Chriſt and he were engaged, was greatly concern'd: It was therefore fit that he that was at the Head of the whole Affair ſhould be informed of it, for his future Conduct in the Affairs of his King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. And accordingly we find that Jeſus ſeems imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately to be influenced in his Conduct by theſe Tidings; as you may ſee in the next Verſe, <hi>When Jeſus heard of it he departed thence by Ship into a deſart Place apart.</hi> Thus <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples <hi>ſought God's Glory.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Obſervation from the Words that I would make the Subject of my Diſcourſe at this Time is this,</p>
            <p>
               <q>When any one is taken away by Death, that has been eminent in the Work of the Goſpel-Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry, ſuch as are thereby bereaved, ſhould go and ſpread their Calamity before Jeſus.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Though in handling this Subject I might particularly ſpeak to ſeveral <hi>Propoſitions</hi> that are contained in this Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and many Things might profitably be inſiſted on under it, if there were Room for it within the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of a Sermon; yet I ſhall only give the <hi>Reaſons of the Doctrine,</hi> and then haſten to the Application.</p>
            <p>The following <hi>Reaſons</hi> may be given why, in Caſe of ſuch an awful Diſpenſation of Providence, thoſe that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004712_0005_100DC45ED6F3FA00"/>
are concerned in it, and bereaved by it, ſhould go and ſpread their Sorrows before Jeſus.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Chriſt is one <hi>that is ready to pity the afflicted.</hi> 'Tis natural for Perſons that are bereaved of any that are dear to 'em, and for all under deep Sorrow, to ſeek ſome that they may declare and lay open their Griefs to, that they have good Reaſon to think will pity 'em, and have a Fellow-feeling with them of their Diſtreſs. The Heart that is full of Grief wants Vent, and deſires to pour out its Complaint; but it ſeeks a compaſſionate Friend to pour it out before.</p>
            <p>Chriſt is ſuch an one, above all others. He of old, before his Incarnation manifeſted himſelf full of Compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion towards his People; for that is Jeſus that is ſpoken of Iſa. 63.9. <hi>In all their Affliction he was afflicted; and and the Angel of his Preſence ſaved them; in his Love and in his Pity he redeemed them; and he bare them, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them all the Days of old.</hi> And when he was upon Earth in his State of Humiliation. He was the moſt wonderful Inſtance of a tender, pitiful, compaſſionate Spirit that ever appeared in the World. How often are we told of his having Compaſſion on one and another? So Matth. 15.32. <hi>Then Jeſus called his Diſciples, and ſaid unto them, I have Compaſſion on the Multitude.</hi> So he had Compaſſion on the Man poſſeſſed with Devils, Mark 5.19. <hi>Go home to thy Friends, and tell them how great Things the Lord hath done to thee, and hath had</hi> Compaſſion <hi>on thee.</hi> So we read of his pitying the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that was bereaved of her Son, <hi>Luke</hi> 7.13. There we have an Account, when Chriſt went into the City of <hi>Nain,</hi> and met the People carrying out a dead Man, the only Son of his Mother, that was a Widow, that when he ſaw her he had Compaſſion on her. So when the two blind Men that ſat by the Way-ſide, cried to Jeſus, as he paſſed by, ſaying, <hi>Have Mercy on us, O Lord, thou Son of David.</hi> We read that Jeſus had Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004712_0006_100DC4605BD29AB8"/>
on them, Matth<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 20.39. So we read of his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>moved with Compaſſion,</hi> Matth. 14.14. <hi>And Jeſus went forth, and ſaw a great Multitude, and when he ſaw them he was moved with Compaſſion.</hi> His Speeches to his Diſciples were full of Compaſſion; eſpecially thoſe that he utter'd a little before his Death, of which we have an Account in the 13, 14, 15, &amp; 16. Chapters of <hi>John.</hi> His Miracles were almoſt univerſally Deeds of Pity to Perſons under Affliction.</p>
            <p>And ſeeing ſuch a pitiful Heart appeared in him on all Occaſions, no Wonder that <hi>John</hi>'s Diſciples when be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved of their dear Guide and Teacher, and their Hearts were full of Sorrow, came to him for Pity: Which likewiſe induc'd <hi>Mary</hi> and <hi>Martha</hi> to come and fall down pouring out their Tears at Jeſus Feet, when their dear Brother <hi>Lazarus</hi> was dead: Other Jews came to comfort them, before Jeſus came, whom they little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, but when they heard that Jeſus was come, they ſoon go and ſpread their Sorrows before him; they were aſſured that he would pity 'em; and their Expectation was not fruſtrated; for he was moſt tenderly affected and moved at their Tears: We are told that on that Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion he groaned in Spirit and was troubled, <hi>John</hi> 11.33. And when he came to the Grave, 'tis obſerved, and a ſpecial Note ſeems to be ſet upon it, that <hi>he wept,</hi> Ver. 35.</p>
            <p>He was one that wept with thoſe that wept. And indeed it was meer Pity that brought him into the World, and induced him not only to ſhed Tears but to ſhed his Blood: He poured out his Blood as Water on the Earth, out of Compaſſion to the poor miſerable Children of Men. And when do we ever read of any one Perſon coming to him when on Earth, with an heavy Heart, or under <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Kind of Sorrow or Diſtreſs for Pity or
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004712_0007_100DC461E4419DC0"/>

            <p>And he has the <hi>ſame Compaſſion</hi> now he is <hi>aſcended into Glory</hi>: There is ſtill the ſame Encouragement for bereaved Ones to go and ſpread their Sorrows before him.</p>
            <p>Afflicted Perſons love to ſpeak of their Sorrows to them that have had <hi>Experience</hi> of Affliction, and know what Sorrow is: But there is none on Earth or in Heaven that ever had ſo much Experience of Sorrow as Chriſt: Therefore he <hi>knows how to pity</hi> the ſorrowful, and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially may we be confident that he is ready to pity thoſe that are bereaved of a <hi>faithful Miniſter,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe ſuch a Bereavement is a Calamity that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns the <hi>Souls of Men</hi>; and Chriſt hath eſpecially ſhewn his Pity to Men's Souls; for it was chiefly for them that he died: To relieve the Miſeries of the Soul eſpecially, is it that he hath provided; and it was from Pity to the Souls of Men that he made that Proviſion for them that he hath done, in appointing ſuch an Order of Men as <hi>Goſpel-Miniſters,</hi> and in ſending them forth to preach the Goſpel: It was becauſe he had Compaſſion on Men's Souls, that he hath appointed Miniſters to watch for Souls.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Chriſt <hi>has purchaſed all that Perſons need under ſuch a Bereavement.</hi> He has purchas'd all that miſerable Men ſtand in Need of under all their Calamities, and comfort under every Sort of Affliction: And therefore his Invi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation to thoſe <hi>that Labour and are heavy laden,</hi> to come to him for Reſt, may be underſtood in the moſt extenſive Senſe, to extend to thoſe that <hi>labour</hi> under any Kind of Burden of Sin or Sorrow, and to all that are <hi>heavy laden</hi> with either natural or moral Evil: He has purchaſed divine Cordials and Supports for thoſe Hearts that are rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy

            <p n="3">3. Chriſt <hi>is able to afford all that Help that is needed in ſuch a Caſe.</hi> His Power and his Wiſdom are as ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient as his Purchaſe, and anſwerable to his Compaſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. By the Bowels of his Mercies, the Love and Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of his Heart, he is diſpoſed to help thoſe that are in Affliction; and his Ability is anſwerable to his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition. He is able to ſupport the Heart under the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vieſt Sorrows, and to give Light in the greateſt Dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: He can divide the thickeſt Cloud with Beams of heavenly Light and Comfort: He is one that gives <hi>Songs in the Night,</hi> and <hi>turns the Shadow of Death into the Morning</hi>: He has Power to make up the Loſs of thoſe that are bereaved by the Death of the moſt emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent Miniſter. His own Preſence with the bereaved is ſufficient; if the great Shepherd and Biſhop of Souls be preſent, how much more is this than enough to ſupply the Want of any under Shepherd? And then he is able to furniſh others with like Gifts and Graces for that Work.</p>

               </p>
               <p>There are many that may well look on themſelves as nearly concerned in this awful Providence, and Sharers in the Bereavement; all of whom ſhould be directed by this Doctrine, to go and ſpread their Affliction before <hi>Jeſus,</hi> that compaſſionate, all-ſufficient Head of the Church, and Saviour of the Body, that <hi>merciful and faithful High Prieſt,</hi> that knows how to pity the afflicted.</p>
               <p>And particularly it now becomes and concerns you, that belong to this <hi>Church and Congregation,</hi> that are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaved of your aged and <hi>eminent Paſtor</hi> and <hi>Father,</hi> that has ſo long been a great Bleſſing to you, now to <hi>go and tell Jeſus.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The Diſciples of <hi>John,</hi> ſpoken of in the <hi>Text,</hi> were thoſe that were ordinarily under his Inſtruction, and were his conſtant Hearers, as it has been with you with Reſpect to your <hi>aged Paſtor,</hi> that is now taken from you.

Don't think that you have finiſhed your Duty, when you have <hi>taken up his Body and buried it,</hi> and have ſhewn Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to his Memory and Remains at his <hi>Funeral</hi>: This is the leaſt Part of your Duty: That which mainly concerns you under this awful Providence, is between Chriſt and your own Souls.</p>
               <p>God has now taken away from you an able and <hi>faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Miniſter</hi> of the <hi>New-Teſtament,</hi> one that has long been a Father to you, and a <hi>Father in our Iſrael,</hi> a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of uncommon natural Abilities, and diſtinguiſhed Learning, a great <hi>Divine,</hi> of very comprehenſive Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and of a ſolid accurate Judgment.—<hi>Judiciouſneſs

and Wiſdom</hi> were eminently his Character. He was one of eminent <hi>Gifts,</hi> qualifying him for all Parts of the Work of the Miniſtry; and there appeared a <hi>Savour of Holineſs,</hi> in his Exerciſe of thoſe Gifts in <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate</hi>: So that he improved 'em as a Servant of Chriſt, and <hi>a Man of God.</hi> He was not negligent of the <hi>Talents</hi> which his Lord had committed to him; you need not be told with what conſtant Diligence he improved them, how <hi>ſtudious</hi> at home, and how laborious in his pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick Work: He <hi>ever devoted himſelf</hi> to the Work to which he was called: The <hi>Miniſtry</hi> which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the Lord he <hi>took Heed to fulfil it,</hi> and purſued it with a conſtant and ſtedfaſt, even Mind through all it's <hi>Difficulties.</hi>

               <p>You know his Manner of addreſſing Heaven in his <hi>publick Prayers</hi> with you and for you, with what Sanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity, Humility, Faith and Fervency, he ſeemed to apply himſelf to the <hi>Father of Lights,</hi> from Time to Time, when he ſtood in this <hi>Deſk</hi> as <hi>your Mouth to God,</hi> and interceeding for you, pleading with God through the Grace and <hi>Merits of a glorious Mediator.</hi> And you know his Manner of <hi>applying himſelf to you</hi> when he came to you, from Time to Time, in the Name of the Lord.</p>
               <p>In his <hi>publick Miniſtry,</hi> he mainly inſiſted on the moſt weighty and <hi>important Things of Religion</hi>; he was emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nently an <hi>evangelical</hi> Preacher; evangelical Subjects ſeemed to be his Delight: CHRIST was the great Subject of his Preaching; and he much inſiſted on thoſe Things that did nearly concern the <hi>Eſſence and Power</hi> of Religion; and had a peculiar Faculty of <hi>judiciouſly and clearly</hi> handling the Doctrines he inſiſted on, and treating properly whatever Subject he took in Hand; and of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting the moſt <hi>weighty Arguments</hi> and Motives to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force and ſet home thoſe Things that concern Chriſtian

               <p>And you need not be told with what Weight the <hi>Welfare of your Souls</hi> ſeemed to lie on his Heart, and how he <hi>inſtructed,</hi> and <hi>reproved, and warned, and exhorted you, with all Authority,</hi> and with a fatherly tender Concern for your eternal Good. — And with what Wiſdom he <hi>preſided</hi> in the <hi>Houſe of God,</hi> and guided its Affairs; and alſo <hi>counſel'd</hi> and <hi>directed</hi> you <hi>in private,</hi> under you par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular <hi>Soul Exerciſes</hi> and Difficulties. You know how he has brought you up, (for moſt of you have been train'd up from <hi>your Childhood under his Miniſtry,</hi>) with what Authority, and with what <hi>Judgment, Prudence</hi> and Steadineſs, he has conducted you as well as <hi>Meek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> and <hi>Gentleneſs.</hi> You know his Manner of going in and out among you, how <hi>exemplary</hi> his Walk and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation has been, with what Gravity, Judgment and Savour of Holineſs, he has walked before you, as <hi>a Man of God.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You have enjoyed great Advantages for your Souls Good, under his Miniſtry: That you had ſuch a Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter was your Privilege and your Honour; he has been an <hi>Ornament to the Town</hi> of <hi>Hatfield</hi>; and his Preſence and Converſation amongſt you has been both profitable and pleaſant; for though it was ſuch as did peculiarly command <hi>Awe and Reſpect,</hi> yet it was at the ſame Time, <hi>humble and condeſcending</hi>: It tended both to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruct and entertain thoſe that he converſed with: As a wiſe Man, and endued with Knowledge, He <hi>ſhew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

out of a good Converſation his Works with Meekneſs of Wiſdom.</hi>

               <p>But now it hath pleaſed an holy God to take him away from you: You'l <hi>ſee his Face</hi> and hear his Voice <hi>no more,</hi> in the Land of the Living: You'l no more have the Comfort and Benefits of his Preſence with you, and the Exerciſe of his Miniſtry among you.</p>
               <p>Therefore now <hi>go to Jeſus,</hi> the ſupream Head of the Church, and <hi>Biſhop of Souls.</hi> Your Paſtor is dead, and will not live again till the laſt Day: But Chriſt the <hi>chief Shepherd,</hi> though <hi>he was dead, is</hi> now <hi>alive! and behold he lives for evermore.

Go to that Jeſus whom your deceaſed Paſtor preached, and to whom he earneſtly invited you while he lived, and give <hi>Thanks</hi> for the many Bleſſings you enjoy'd in him.

                  </note>; and go and <hi>humble your ſelves alſo before him,</hi> that you made no better Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Miniſtry of your Paſtor while he lived; and beg of him a ſanctified Improvement of his awful Hand in taking him away, and that he would help you to remember his Warnings and Counſels that you too much ſlighted whilſt you had them, leaſt thoſe Warn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Counſels cry againſt you, and riſe up in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment againſt you another Day, leaſt you ſee <hi>your Paſtor</hi> that ſo affectionately and earneſtly, and ſo often, and for

ſo long a Time continued to exhort you, and earneſtly prayed for you, while he lived, <hi>riſing up in Judgment,</hi> and bearing Teſtimony againſt you, declaring how conſtantly and laboriouſly he intreated and called upon you, and how obſtinately ſome of you ſlighted his Counſels; and leaſt you ſee him <hi>ſitting with Chriſt</hi> to judge and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn you, and <hi>adoring his awful Juſtice</hi> on your aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated Puniſhment.</p>
               <p>All you that have an Intereſt in JESUS, now go to him on this Occaſion, and <hi>tell him of your Bereavement,</hi> and <hi>beg</hi> of him that he <hi>would not depart from you</hi>; but that he would make up his Loſs in his own <hi>immediate Preſence.</hi> Go to him for your <hi>ſurviving Paſtor,</hi> that he would be with him, and furniſh him more and more for, and aſſiſt him in that <hi>great Work,</hi> that is now <hi>wholly</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved upon him, and make him alſo a <hi>burning and ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Light</hi> amongſt you; and that you may have of the Preſence and Bleſſing of JESUS with you, and him.</p>
               <p>And now, Since I am called to ſpeak in the Name of Chriſt on this ſolemn Occaſion, I would apply my ſelf to the <hi>near Relations</hi> of the Deceaſed, who are eſpecially to be looked upon, as the <hi>bereaved.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>God in his holy Providence has taken from you one that has been a great <hi>Bleſſing, Comfort and Honour</hi> to you, and deſervedly very <hi>dear to you,</hi> and <hi>honoured</hi> of you. The Doctrine we are upon directs you what to do in your preſent Circumſtances, <hi>viz.</hi> To <hi>go to Jeſus,</hi> to go and ſpread your Affliction before an all-ſufficient Redeemer.</p>
               <p>And particularly I would apply my ſelf to the <hi>honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Relict,</hi> who ſtood in the neareſt Relation of any to the Deceaſed, whom God by this awful Providence has made a <hi>ſorrowful Widow.</hi> Suffer me, <hi>honoured Madam,</hi> in your

great Affliction to exhibit to you a <hi>compaſſionate Redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer.</hi> God has now taken from you that Servant of his, that was the <hi>neareſt and beſt Friend</hi> you had in this World, that was your wiſe and prudent Guide, your af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate and pleaſant Companion, who was ſo great a Bleſſing while he lived, to you and your Family, and <hi>under Chriſt,</hi> was ſo much the Comfort and Support of your Life. You ſee, <hi>Madam,</hi> where your Reſort muſt be: Your earthly Friends can condole your Loſs, but can't make it up to you; we muſt all confeſs our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be but <hi>miſerable Comforters</hi>: But you may <hi>go and tell Jeſus,</hi> and there you may have both <hi>Support and Reparation:</hi> His Love and his Preſence is far beyond that of the neareſt and moſt affectionate earthly Friend. Now you are bereaved of your earthly Conſort, you may go to a <hi>ſpiritual Huſband,</hi> and ſeek his Compaſſion and his Company; He is the Fountain of all that Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Prudence, that Piety, that tender Affection and faithful Care, that you enjoyed in your departed Conſort; in him is an <hi>infinite Fountain</hi> of all theſe Things, and of all good; in him you may have <hi>Light in your Darkneſs,</hi> Comfort in your Sorrow, and Fulneſs of Joy and Glory in another World, in an everlaſting Union with your dear <hi>deceaſed Relative,</hi> in the glorious Preſence of the ſame <hi>Redeemer,</hi> in <hi>whoſe Preſence is Fulneſs of Joy, and at whoſe right Hand are Pleaſures for evermore.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>This Doctrine alſo directs the bereaved <hi>afflicted Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren,</hi> that are with Hearts full of Grief, now mourning over a dear <hi>departed Father,</hi> where to go, and what to do. You will no longer have your Father's <hi>Wiſdom</hi> to guide you, his <hi>tender Love</hi> to comfort and delight you, and his affectionate Care to guard you and aſſiſt you, and his <hi>pious and judicious Counſels</hi> to direct you, and his <hi>holy Examples</hi> ſet before you, and his fervent, humble, believing <hi>Prayers</hi> with you and for you.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="19" facs="unknown:004712_0016_100DC4771C4142D8"/>But in the bleſſed <hi>Jeſus,</hi> your Father's Lord and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer, you may have much more, than all thoſe Things: Your Father's Vertues that made him ſo <hi>great a Bleſſing</hi> to you, were but the <hi>Image of</hi> what is in CHRIST.</p>
               <p>Therefore go to him in your <hi>Mourning</hi>: Go and tell Jeſus; tell a compaſſionate Saviour what has befallen you. Heretofore you have had an earthly Father to go to, whoſe <hi>Heart</hi> was full of <hi>Tenderneſs</hi> to you; but the <hi>Heart</hi> of his <hi>Redeemer</hi> is much more <hi>tender</hi>; his Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and his Love is infinitely beyond that of any earthly Parent. Go to him, and then you will ſurely find Comfort. Go to him and you'l find that, though you are bereaved, yet you are not left in any Want, you'l find that all your Wants are ſupplied, and all your Loſs made up, and much more than ſo.</p>
               <p>But here I would particularly, in Humility addreſs my ſelf, to my honoured Fathers, the <hi>Sons of the Deceaſed,</hi> that are improved in the ſame great Work of the <hi>Goſpel Miniſtry,</hi> or in other <hi>publick Buſineſs</hi> for the Service of their Generation. — Honoured Sirs, Though it might be more proper for me to come to you for In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Counſel, than to take it upon me to <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hort you,</hi> yet as I am one that ought to have a Fellow-feeling of your Affliction, and to look on my ſelf as a <hi>Sharer</hi> in it, and as you have <hi>deſired me</hi> to ſpeak in the Name of Chriſt, on this Occaſion, ſuffer me to mention to you that Source of Comfort, that infinite <hi>Fountain of Good,</hi> one of the larger Streams of which, has failed by the Death of an earthly Father, even the bleſſed JESUS. You will doubtleſs acknowledge it as an Inſtance of his great Goodneſs to you, that you have been the <hi>Sons</hi> of <hi>ſuch a Father</hi>; being ſenſible that your Reputation and Serviceableneſs in your Generation, has been, under Chriſt, very much owing to the <hi>great Advantages</hi> you

From whom you may receive Comfort under your Bereavement, and from whom you may receive more of <hi>that Spirit</hi> that <hi>dwelt in him,</hi> and greater Degrees of thoſe Vertues he derived from Chriſt, to cauſe you to ſhine brighter, and to make you ſtill greater Bleſſings in your Generation. Now Death has veiled and hid from Sight, a <hi>Star</hi> that ſhone with <hi>reflected Light,</hi> our <hi>Text and Doctrine</hi> leads you to the <hi>Sun</hi> that hath <hi>Light in himſelf,</hi> and ſhines with infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite unfailing Brightneſs.

               <p>I nextly would addreſs my ſelf to the <hi>ſurviving Paſtor</hi> of this Church.

God has now taken <hi>our Father and Maſter</hi> from our Head: He has remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved him that has heretofore under Chriſt, been very much <hi>our Strength</hi> that we have been wont to Reſort to in <hi>difficult Caſes</hi> for Inſtruction and Direction, and that uſed to be amongſt us from Time to Time, in our <hi>Aſſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciations,</hi> and that we were wont to behold as the Head and <hi>Ornament</hi> of thoſe <hi>Conventions</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Very worthy of our Notice was that his farewel Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage ſent us by one of our beloved <hi>Brethren</hi> (the Rev. Mr. <hi>Williams</hi> of <hi>Springfield</hi>) after he returned from ſuch a <hi>Meeting,</hi> where he alſo preach'd. — 'I don't expect (ſaid he) to be with you another <hi>Aſſociation-Meeting</hi>: but I give you this Advice, Love your <hi>Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter,</hi> love your <hi>Work,</hi> and love <hi>one another.'</hi> How very expreſſive of his own Spirit? like <hi>John</hi> the belo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved Diſciple.</note>. Where elſe can we

now go but to Jeſus, the ever-living Head of the whole Church, and <hi>Lord of the</hi> whole <hi>Harveſt,</hi> the <hi>Fountain of Light,</hi> our great Lord and Maſter that ſends all Goſpel-Miniſters, and on whom they univerſally depend. Let this <hi>awful Providence</hi> bring us to look to Chriſt, to ſeek more of his Preſence with us; and that HE would pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide as Head in our <hi>Aſſociations</hi>: Let it bring us to a more immediate and <hi>entire Dopendance upon him,</hi> for <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction and Direction,</hi> in all our <hi>Difficulties.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Let us on this Occaſion conſider what God has done in this County of late Years: It was not many Years ago that the County was filled with aged Miniſters, that were our Fathers, <hi>But our Fathers, where are they?</hi> — What a great Alteration is made in a little Time, in the <hi>Churches</hi> in this Part of the Land! <note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>The Rev. Mr.</hi> Stoddard, <hi>Mr.</hi> Taylor, <hi>Mr.</hi> Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liams <hi>of</hi> Deerfield, <hi>Mr.</hi> Brewer, <hi>and lately have died, Mr.</hi> Bull <hi>of</hi> Weſtfield, <hi>and Mr.</hi> Devotion <hi>of</hi> Suffield.</note> How frequent of late have been the <hi>Warnings</hi> of this Kind that God has given us to prepare to <hi>give up our Account!</hi> Let us go to Jeſus, and ſeek Grace of him that we may be faithful while we live, and that he would aſſiſt us in our great Work, that when we alſo are called hence, we may <hi>give up our Account with Joy and not with Grief,</hi> and that hereafter we may meet thoſe our Fathers, that have gone before us in the faithful Labours of the Goſpel, and that we may <hi>ſhine forth</hi> with them, <hi>as the Brightneſs of the Firmament, and as the Stars forever and ever.</hi>
