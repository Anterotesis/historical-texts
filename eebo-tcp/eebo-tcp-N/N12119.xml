            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE Author of mankind hath ſeen fit to give us ſuch ſocial capacities, and form us for a conſtitution, under which we are ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily dependent on one another, that no one can act againſt the intereſt of his community without endangering his own happineſs. He hath laid us under the ſtrongeſt obligations, by the mutual ties of the benefit of ſociety and our own good, to obſerve the ſtricteſt rules of benevolence, juſtice, and every public virtue. And that we might not be at a loſs to know what is our duty to one another, he hath mercifully given us this plain rule, and fixed the ſtandard in every man's own breaſt, <hi>whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them.</hi> And to enforce this, he hath added the <hi>ſevereſt</hi> threatnings againſt it's violators, and every poſſible encouragement for it's obſervers; ſo that no one, unleſs he is under the prevailing influence of an

exceedingly depraved, wicked heart—and is actuated by a <hi>deteſtably</hi> covetous, ſelfiſh diſpoſition, can plead ignorance of what is right in his common dealings with mankind. And yet how common is it for men, both to their own, and to the detriment of the public, to leap the bounds preſcribed them by this divine law of nature and revelation?—This was remarkably the caſe with the Iſraelites—. After the death of King Solomon, under whoſe reign, never were a people, perhaps, more united and happy, Rehoboam ſucceeded to the throne—. Under him the people ſoon grew uneaſy, complained of their heavy bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dens; and a univerſal murmur aroſe, throughout the kingdom—. Petitions were prefered to the King, but were anſwered with no other than thoſe irri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating, afflictive expreſſions, <hi>my father made your yoke heavy, but I will add thereto: my father chaſtiſed you with whips, but I will chaſtiſe you with ſcorpions.</hi> Upon this the people grew deſperate, and cried out; <hi>what portion have we in David? and we have none inheritance in the ſon of Jeſſe: every man to your tents, O Iſrael: and now David ſee to thine own houſe.</hi> Every tribe, Judah and Benjamin excepted, unani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouſly revolted from him. Diſtreſſing wars imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately commenced between the ten tribes of Iſrael on the one ſide, and the two houſes of Judah, and Benjamin on the other. God made them inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of puniſhment to each other, becauſe neither ſerved him. <hi>The Lord teſtified againſt Iſrael, and againſt Judah, becauſe they hardened their necks, and would not believe in the Lord their God.</hi> And all was a diſmal ſcene of wars, and judgments upon the land, till both Judah and Jeruſalem, were ſo weakened, and deſtroyed as to become an eaſy prey to foreign powers; and the Babylonians made a compleat conqueſt over them. In the time of their
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:015299_0005_0F98CF42592A7588"/>
captivity, while they ſuffered the moſt cruel ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude, and were groaning under the burdens impoſed on them by their new maſters, they murmured againſt GOD, and grew exceedingly vicious among themſelves. The cry of their iniquities reached the heavens; and the Lord ſent his Servant, Ezekiel, to reprove them for their ſins—. With all the zeal, boldneſs and faithfulneſs of a Prophet, he lifted up his voice like a trumpet, and pathetically exclaimed againſt the ſins of Jeruſalem, ſparing no order of men, as all were verily guilty. Their Princes, and Rulers were exceedingly cruel and oppreſſive—they even threw off the natural ties of kindred, <hi>ſet light by father, and mother, oppreſſed the ſtranger, and vexed the fatherleſs, and the widow,</hi> to promote their own honor, wealth and dominion. Their chief men, who ought to have done every thing they could to promote virtue and religion among the people, caſt off the fear of the Lord, deſpiſed holy things, and became the ſad examples of lewdneſs, and abomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation—. Next to theſe, he laſhes the vices of the Prieſts; for they in Jeruſalem were culpable as well as others: <hi>her Prieſts,</hi> ſaith God, <hi>have violated my law, and profaned my holy things; they have put no difference between the holy and profane—and have hid their eyes from my Sabbaths, and I am pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faned among them.—And her prophets have daubed them with untempered mortar.</hi> Theſe, and many other ſins, prevailed in Jeruſalem; which raiſed the anger, and indignation of the Lord againſt them. But it is commonly the caſe in all declenſions, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, in every period of the world, that ſome one ſin is more general, and prevalent than any other, at that time.—If we attend to the chapter, in which the text is inſerted, we ſhall find this to have been the caſe with the Jews—Their predominant ſin,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:015299_0006_0F98CF43062EBBB0"/>
which the Prophet charges upon every order of men among them, as their circumſtances afforded them the opportunity to practiſe it, ſeems to have been, <hi>Extortion;</hi> or internal oppreſſion. Which was the more inexcuſable in them, as they, at the ſame time, were complaining of oppreſſion from their enemies— But ſo inconſiſtent is mankind, that the very things they eſteem moſt grievous in others, they frequently practiſe themſelves. So it was with Jeruſalem. Her Princes, Rulers, Judges and great men, were like wolves devouring their prey, deſtroying the people to increaſe their own wealth.—The Prophets pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſied for gain, and ſtripped the people of their riches, at the ſame time they neglected their ſouls— yea, ſaith the Prophet, <hi>they have devoured ſouls, have taken the treaſure and precious things, and made her</hi> (Jeruſalem) <hi>many widows in the midſt thereof</hi>—. "Which they did," ſays that learned Expoſitor, Mr. Huſt, <q>one while, by raiſing perſecutions, cutting off huſbands from their wives; another while, and which agrees moſt with the place, perſuading, encouraging, and bewitching Zedekiah, and the Princes, and People, to hold out the war, and run all hazards and extremities of that ſiege, which filled Jeruſalem with dead huſbands, and forlorn widows.</q> 
               <hi>And the people of the land have uſed oppreſſion, and exerciſed robbery, and have vexed the poor and needy: yea, they have oppreſſed the ſtranger wrong fully.</hi> Forgetting this eternal rule of right, <hi>love thy neighbour as thy ſelf,</hi> they devoured one another, with an inſatiable thirſt for gain. So that, upon ſuppoſition, there might be ſome individuals, who kept themſelves free from their reigning ſins, yet, to every order of men among them, taken collectively. the words of our text might ſutably apply;—<hi>thou haſt greedily gained of thy neighbours by extortion, and haſt forgotten me, ſaith the Lord GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:015299_0007_0F98CF4485C19648"/>To draw a parallel between the ſins and circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of the Jews and our own, is not my intention. The heavy Judgments, with which we are viſited, and that cry of extortion, and oppreſſion, which rings through the land, aſſimilaes us in ſome degree at leaſt.</p>
            <p>And now, ſeeing Almighty God, notwithſtanding our exceeding ingratitude, and unthankfulneſs toward him, hath given us this day to ſee the beginning of a New-Year, can we do better then to turn aſide from our ſecular affairs, and employ a few moments in reflecting upon the increaſing, predominant evil, with which we have cloſed the laſt?— O may we humble ourſelves before God, and devoutly pray for a ſpeedy reformation, that by his ſovran, rich grace, we may begin, and end this year in a better manner than we have done the proceeding.</p>
            <p>In order to illuſtrate the ſubject, and as much as poſſible to accomodate it to the preſent purpoſe, it will be convenient for us, in the firſt place, to conſider the import of the word, <hi>Extortion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, to make ſome remarks upon the origin of this evil.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, to conſider ſomething of its evil nature, and hurtful tendency.</p>
            <p>Firſt, let us conſider the import of the word, <hi>Extortion,</hi> made uſe of in the text.</p>
            <p>In our language, it is not in all caſes, exactly of the ſame ſignification with the word <hi>oppreſſion;</hi> tho' they are both frequently uſed in the ſame ſenſe. <hi>Oppreſſion,</hi> is a more general term, and is rather applied to authority, and ſignifies various <hi>kinds</hi> of injuſtice; ſuch as unrighteous laws,—iniquitous taxes—infringments
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:015299_0008_0F98CF45458EA738"/>
of liberty, and the rights of conſcience—and all ſuch impoſitions as are inimical to ſociety, and contrary to the natural laws of juſtice, and equity. But the word <hi>Extortion,</hi> ſeems rather limited to the actions of individuals; and is applied to thoſe more private advantages which men take of the neceſſities of others, in their common dealings, eſpecially in caſes of <hi>buying,</hi> and <hi>ſelling</hi>—but notwithſtanding there may be this difference in ſtrictneſs, yet by common uſage, they are both frequently applied to the ſame purpoſes; and ſometimes bear the ſame ſenſe in ſcripture, <hi>lev.</hi> 25.14. <hi>If thou ſell ought unto thy neighbour, or buyeſt ought of thy neighbours hand; ye ſhall not oppreſs one another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, let us make ſome remarks upon the origin of this evil.</p>
            <p>This evil in ſtrictneſs, no doubt takes its riſe from the grand ſource of all other ſins, the depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the human heart. This is the root of all our moral calamities. <hi>From whence come wars and ſightings among you? come they not hence, even of your luſts, that war in your members?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But notwithſtanding all our ſinful actions ſpring from the ſame ſource yet they are not all alike. As in the branches of a tree, ſome take their more immediate riſe out of others, and make a very different appearance, tho' all are nouriſhed by the ſame ſtock, ſo many ſins, take their riſe out of others, and put on different appearances, and yet are all ſed by the ſame original fountain. To inſtance in covetouſneſs, and prodigality; ſins as unlike as ſins can be; theſe ſpring more immediately from dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent hiſts, or inclinations, and yet both are nouriſhed from the ſame corrupt fountain, a depraved heart.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:015299_0009_0F98CF4605BEB7E8"/>Extortion ſeems to be the progeny of an amazing avaricious <hi>luſt</hi> after worldly gain. For an inordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate deſire after the world, may as properly be called a luſt, as any ſin of which mankind may be guilty—. And ſo it is denominated in the holy ſcriptures: hence ſays the Apoſtle James, when ſpeaking of ſuch; <hi>ye adulterers and adultereſſes, know ye not that the friendſhip of the world is enmity with God? whoſoever therefore will be a friend of the world, is the enemy of God.</hi> Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion therefore we may conceive, ariſes from an inſatiable, avaricious deſire of gain; a luſt which ſeduces men into a train of oppreſſive actions, and unjuſt, and iniquitous practices, to increaſe their own private intereſts; and betrays a mind, almoſt too contracted, mean, and baſe to be called human.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, let us conſider ſomething of the evil nature, and hurtful tendency of Extortion.</p>
            <p>To give an adequate idea of the evil nature or to paint the hurtful tendency of this <hi>deteſtable</hi> practice, language would be inſufficient, and the power of deſcription fail. To hint at a few things only, which are plain and obvious to every impar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial obſerver, is all I ſhall attempt.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Extortion is a breach of the natural laws of juſtice and equity; for theſe all require, that in every ſpecies of dealing with mankind, we ſhould become mutually advantageous to each other. But the tendency of extortion is to advance a man's own private intereſt and bring <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

               </gap> upon others. He who takes <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> of his neighbour, diminiſhing <hi>his</hi> 
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:015299_0010_0F98CF46C5D45AF8"/>
he receives, is a violator of the laws of juſtice and equity. And the man whoſe impartial conſcience cannot anſwer in the affirmative to this ſimple queſtion, in every inſtance of trade, <hi>have I done, as I would be done by?</hi> muſt plead guilty.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Extortion is a violation of the laws of mercy, kindneſs, and benevolence. Theſe all require us to extend our pity and compaſſion to our fellow crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. But the Extortioner exerciſes none of theſe— His heart, his eyes, his hands, and every bowel of love, and mercy are ſhut againſt the diſtreſſes and wants of others; and his ears deaf to all their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints—He matters not how great a diminution others ſuſtain in their wealth, and happineſs, if he can but ſecure his own.— Loſt to every ſocial virtue, he puts of the man, and aſſumes rather the character of ſome voracious animal, who, to ſatiate his own greedineſs, would devour all around him. Extortion in a ſpecial manner, is very unmerciful, and deſtreſſing to the poor—<q>The want of the outward neceſſaries of life is a ſore calamity, and what mercy requires us not only to commiſerate; but to do all that is in our power to relieve</q>—. The poor are of this denomination—their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances call for our pity and compaſſion—But what does the <hi>Extortioner?</hi> Inſtead of affording relief, he adds to their miſeries, and wants. Yea, further, is not Extortion, in a great meaſure, the cauſe of their miſery? does it not bring the diſtreſſing calamity of pinching want upon thouſands, who otherwiſe might have been ſtrangers to ſuch deep affliction forever! What a ſhocking reflection doth this afford! What complacency can the Extortioner take in his unjuſt gain, while many, from whom he has extorted it, and who were intitled to his
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:015299_0011_0F98CF478591D3B8"/>
mercy and compaſſion, may be now groaning and dying for want? At leaſt it is not owing to his benevolence if they are not. How contrary is this to the rules of the benevolent Goſpel; which teacheth us not to be anxious for the meat that periſheth, but to abound in good works, and in the grace of liberality? eſpecially to extend mercy to the poor—<hi>for he that hath pity on the poor lendeth to the Lord</hi>— And ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>bleſſed is he who conſidereth the poor.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Extortion is a breach of the natural laws of ſociety. For it is not only cruel and unjuſt treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of individuals; but is exceedingly detrimental to the community, by weakening ſociety, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dangering the ſtate. The ſtrongeſt bond of ſociety is mutual intereſt. But to this, Extortion is diametrically oppoſed. Siniſter motives are always oppoſed to the public good; but theſe are the principles which bias the ſoul, and influence the conduct of Extortioners. And as Extortion increaſes, the public intereſt is leſſened; as all ſupplies become proportionably dearer. But beſides this it creates jealouſies, excites feuds, and animoſities, deſtroys mutual confidence, and becomes the bane of that public union in which chiefly the ſtrength of a State conſiſts.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The Extortioner is a foe to himſelf; for by acting againſt the community, ſo far as his influence, and importance extend, ſo far he endangers his own happineſs, by deſtroying <hi>that</hi> on which the protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his perſon and property depends. So that in <hi>one</hi> view an Extortioner is as much a foe to the public and himſelf, as an enemy appearing in open arms; and in ſome ſenſe more ſo; for while the
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:015299_0012_0F98CF488853C660"/>
other ſhows his intention, he is a more ſecret enemy knawing out the bowels under the maſk of a friend; and therefore ought as much to be oppoſed.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Extortioner is not only a foe to himſelf, his neighbour, and his country, but to his GOD; For he, who is ſuch <hi>a friend of the world, is the enemy of GOD.</hi> He makes the world <hi>his</hi> God, and <hi>forſakes the fountain of living waters.</hi> Thus ſaith the text, <hi>thou haſt greedily gained of thy neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours by extortion, and haſt forgotten me, ſaith the Lord God.</hi> But further, Extortioners may be ſaid to forget God, in their violating ſeveral of his particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar commands. For inſtance, their conduct is a breach of the ſixth command; for that <hi>requires every lawful endeavour to preſerve the lives of others as well as of our own.</hi> But they would deſtroy life, by diſtreſſing the poor and the needy, the widow and the fatherleſs. "The <hi>curſes</hi> of <hi>many</hi> ready to periſh come upon them."</p>
            <p>They violate the eightth command, which <hi>requires us to promote the wealth or outward eſtate of others.</hi> But they unrighteouſly take it from them, invert the command of the Apoſtle, and <hi>look every man on his own things, but not on the things of others.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Once more, they are tranſgreſſors of the tenth command, which forbids every ſpecies of covetouſneſs, and manifeſt an unreaſonable, avaricious deſire after the wealth of others: Their covetous hearts know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no bounds, like the horſe-leach continually cry <hi>give, give. They are</hi> like <hi>greedy</hi> animals <hi>which can never have enough.—They all look to their own way, every one for his gain.—They covet greedily all the day long—yea alſo,</hi> as in the language of the prophet,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:015299_0013_0F98CF4A421DC368"/>
               <hi>they enlarge their deſire as hell, and as death, and cannot be ſatisfied.</hi> Conſequently, they are expoſed to the diſpleaſure, and judgments of God here, and to his wrath, and eternal indignation hereafter; for no Extortioner ſhall enter the Kingdom of Heaven. So that let us view <hi>extortion</hi> in what light we pleaſe, we ſhall find it deteſtable in it's nature, and dreadful in it's conſequences.</p>
            <p>Thus we have conſidered ſomething of the evil nature, and hurtful tendency of the ſin of extortion, that foe to God and man, which has invaded the land, and with mercileſs, unrelenting fury, threatens deſtruction all around!</p>
            <p>Internal oppreſſion was not peculiar to the Jews— Mankind, under like circumſtances, are generally the ſame—When opportunities have favored it, <hi>others</hi> have diſcovered the ſame diſpoſition, and run into ſimilar extremes, even the more enlightened age of the world, and the higheſt profeſſing people not excepted; as the preſent times are a melancholy witneſs! This deſtroying evil has pervaded our borders; and it's increaſing rapacity has become exceedingly calamitous! The threatning aſpect calls upon every friend of God, of juſtice, mercy, and benevolence to ariſe, and exert every ſocial faculty to ſtop it's progreſs.—The voice of God, more eſpecially, calls upon the miniſters of Chriſt, in ſome meaſure, as Moſes did upon the children of Iſrael, when they had made themſelves naked with their idolatrous ſins; <hi>who is on the Lord's ſide? gird on every man his</hi> ſpiritual <hi>ſword, and go in and out from gate to gate throughout the camp, and ſlay every man his</hi> ſin, and pull down the iniquity that has ſprung up among us.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:015299_0014_0F98CF4A862DB9E0"/>Chriſt's miniſters are ſet as centinels upon Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem's walls; and are under indiſpenſable obligations to warn the wicked of their danger. The ſolemn charge to Ezekiel, was in theſe words: <hi>Son of man, I have made thee a watchman unto the houſe of Iſrael: therefore hear the word at my mouth, and give them warning from me. When I ſay unto the wicked, thou ſhalt ſurely die, and thou giveſt him not warning nor ſpeakeſt to warn the wicked from his wicked way to ſave his life: the ſame wicked man ſhall die in his iniquity; but his blood will I require at thine hand. Yet if thou warn the wicked, and he turn not from his wickedneſs—he ſhall die in his iniquity: but thou haſt delivered thy ſoul.—Son of man, I do ſend thee unto the houſe of Iſrael; for they have tranſgreſſed againſt me.— And thou, ſon of man, be not afraid of them, neither be afraid of their words,—nor be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed at their looks—I do ſend thee,—and thou ſhalt ſpeak my words unto them, whether they will hear, or whether they will forbear</hi>—Tho' Chriſt's mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters are not now commiſſioned in this extraordinary manner, yet their obligations to be faithful are as ſolemn, and as binding, as in the prophetic days.</p>
            <p>Having this ſufficient warrant, I ſhall endeavour, by the aſſiſtance of <hi>him,</hi> whoſe cauſe I am now pleading, to deliver my ſoul, and whether you will hear or forbear, plainly, and I hope faithfully, apply the ſubject. May the <hi>fear</hi> of GOD ever keep me from <hi>that fear</hi> of man, which <hi>bringeth a ſnare.</hi> And may that text be ever written upon my heart as with the point of a diamond: <hi>Curſed be he that doth the work of the Lord deceitfully.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>From what has been ſaid, we can be at no loſs for the primary cauſes of the reigning ſin of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion at the preſent day. It obviouſly ſprings
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:015299_0015_0F98CF4B6A072BA8"/>
from that <hi>love of money which is the root of all evil: which while ſome covet after they err from the faith, and pierce themſelves through with many ſorrows.</hi> That greedineſs of gain,—that inſatiable luſt after the world which induced <hi>Iſcariot</hi> to betray his Lord and Maſter, is no doubt an inducement with ſome to betray their country—and as it were, to ſell their God.</p>
            <p>But let us make ſome inquiry into the more external or ſecondary cauſes of this evil, which has occaſioned ſuch loud complaints; and which threatens us, at this critical period, with internal deſtruction.</p>
            <p>The complaints in the country are chiefly levelled againſt the merchants, in the maritime towns;—that they have taken advantage of the times and laid extravagant prices on almoſt every article, which the neceſſities of the people have compelled them to purchaſe—. The country perceiving this, and knowing the trading towns could no more ſubſiſt without the produce of the lands, than they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves without the wares of the merchant, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately raiſed the price of almoſt every neceſſary of life, carried into the markets, as high as the general demand would admit them. This has occaſioned an increaſe of extravagance on each ſide, till the conduct of both has become exceedingly oppreſſive. Taking matters as it were by the groſs, and theſe will no doubt be acknowledged, as the more oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible cauſes of the preſent extortion; if we judge of things according to the general complaints. But if we more critically examine the matter, we ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps find, that this evil is not effected by any one cauſe alone, but by a number of accidental cauſes com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined together—. May not theſe be the cauſes?
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:015299_0016_0F98CF4C05D06740"/>
I ſhall not preſume to be judge in the matter; or pretend to determine poſſitively what are the cauſes, but only hint at ſome things by way of inquiry. Have not the ſcarcity of wares, and want of employ induced a number to become adventurers in foreign trade; the hazard now being extremely great, and the few comparatively who return with good voyages, have raiſed inſurances ſo very high, beſides all extra-expences in manning and fitting out, &amp;c. which every one knows muſt be much greater than before the war, that honeſt trading merchants have been neceſſitated to advance the prices of goods ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained at ſuch a riſk, and with ſuch coſts? Not to mention the loſſes they have ſuſtained ſince the war, by the ſtagnation of trade, and otherwiſe, are not theſe reaſons ſufficient to juſtify them? The honeſt ſecond-hand dealer may be obliged to advance upon the prices of his goods, as his ſuppliers advance upon him; and yet compared with other times, and with other things in the preſent times, his intereſt may really ſink rather than gain. Now ought we not in juſtice to make great allowances for theſe things?</p>
            <p>But have not others, who have ſuſtained no ſuch loſſes, nor run any ſuch hazards, taken advantage of theſe things, and extorted in their demands for every article they had to diſpoſe of, merely for the ſake of private gain?</p>
            <p>Are there not ſome, who, ſeeing the circumſtances of the times gave them the opportunity, that peoples neceſſities would compel them to purchaſe at almoſt any rate, have not had virtue enough to withſtand the temptation; but deaf to the voice of juſtice, reaſon and conſcience, and dead to the feelings of benevolence and humanity, have carried their extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the greateſt poſſible length!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:015299_0017_0F98CF4CC5E7B030"/>Are there not ſome others, who had large ſtocks on hand, for which ſome might be deeply indebted to merchants abroad, and had it not been for the preſent unhappy war, before this day might have entered the liſt of Bankrupts; who have extorted upon their goods, that they might enable themſelves to purchaſe the Weſt-India produce which has been wafted ſo plentifully into our ports, that they might keep the trade in their own hands, purpoſely to obtain what advances they pleaſed?</p>
            <p>Again, is it not a fact well known to many in the trading towns, that when foreigners have riſked a trade with us, and offered their commodities for ſale in our ports, at reaſonable prices, that ſome of the larger trading merchants have purchaſed their whole cargoes; giving not only more than they need to have done, but even more than was demanded; with a view to keep up the value of the goods they had on hand? So much have ſome valued their own intereſt above the good of the public.</p>
            <p>Are not ſuch monopolizings and foreſtallings as theſe, the crime of Extortion of the blackeſt hue!</p>
            <p>But if we revert our thoughts to the country, ſhall we not find the ſame avaricious diſpoſition equally prevailing in moſt places, in proportion to the trade carried on, and as the circumſtances of people give them an opportunity? Does it not ſeem as if the whole country was contaminated with a ſpirit of ſelfiſhneſs? Is there any other difference between the Merchant and the Farmer in this reſpect, than what ariſes from their different circumſtances? Altho' the merchants might have been firſt in this iniquity, yet have not the country people eagerly followed; till both have become jealous of each other,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:015299_0018_0F98CF4D8607E648"/>
and ſeem as if reſolved, in ſome inſtances, to out do in Extortion!— From an impartial inquiry into theſe affairs, does it not appear probable, at leaſt, that from ſuch cauſes combined this deſtructive evil takes it's riſe? And yet, how ready is every one to excuſe himſelf from blame, and caſt the fault upon others?— When perhaps, the greater part, if not all who are any ways concerned in trade, whether in Town or Country, are either in a greater or leſs degree promoters of this internal oppreſſion; in addition to our other calamities. Does not the text therefore ſeem pertinent to our preſent circumſtances, and apply is well to the Farmer, as to the Merchant; <hi>thou haſt greedily gained of thy neighbours by Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and haſt forgotten me, ſaith the Lord God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us next conſider who are the more immediate ſufferers by this internal oppreſſion. But this is eaſily diſcerned—. Neither the Merchant nor the Farmer, as individuals; for theſe are apparently gainers—and thoſe who are employed in public bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, many of them at leaſt, the poor <hi>ſoldiers</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted, may find ways and means by their Salaries, Perquiſites, or otherwiſe, to add as much to their private intereſts as to balance their own loſſes, if not more. None of theſe therefore are ſo ſenſibly affected by it, as others: but all who depend alone upon fixed ſalaries, or their own private incomes, having no concern in trade, &amp;c. are immediate and heavy ſufferers. Their intereſts are every day ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and their properties falling by the hand of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tortion. In a word, every claſs of men, thoſe in public employ or ſome trade or other excepted, are ſuffering under the iron hand of mercileſs <hi>internal</hi> Oppreſſion. But the diſtreſſes of the <hi>Poor</hi> eſpecially muſt be inexpreſſibly great. I do not mean of every
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:015299_0019_0F98CFFAC5868148"/>
kind however; ſome of theſe doubtleſs know how to make advantage of the times, as well as other men; and for ought we know, may have as great a hand in Extortion, according to the ſphere in which they act. It is with them, no doubt, as with ſome in higher rank, money never flowed in upon them ſo faſt before in life.—But what, my Friends, muſt become of the <hi>Aged</hi> and <hi>Infirm,</hi> the <hi>Widow</hi> and the <hi>Orphan?</hi> What will become of thouſands, who before theſe difficulties were but one remove from pinching want? What can they ſubſiſt on now? Will not their complaints reach the Heavens, and bring down the judgments of God ſtill heavier upon us? O where are thoſe bowels of mercy, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion, which all the ties of nature, humanity, and religion bind us to exerciſe toward our fellow-creatures? Are we dead to every tender feeling, and benevolent affection! Are we ſinking into that hardened ſtate of the Jews, <hi>when oppreſſion ſwallow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up the needy, and made the poor of the land to fail?</hi> Have we not reaſon to ſay with the Prophet, <hi>we look for judgment, but there is none; for ſalvation, but it is far from us: For our tranſgreſſions are multiplied—, and our ſins teſtify againſt us—. In tranſgreſſing and lying againſt the Lord, departing from the truth, ſpeaking oppreſſion and revolt—Judgment is turned away backward, juſtice ſtandeth afar off; truth is fallen in the ſtreet, and equity cannot enter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>While the Merchant complains of the Farmer, and the Farmer of the Merchant, are not both enriching themſelves with the ſpoils of the poor?— But the Merchant perhaps will plead, that notwithſtanding he has greatly advanced the prices of his wares, yet conſidering the circumſtances of the times, the loſs of trade, &amp;c. he is not upon the whole a gainer by his traffick—. The Farmer may likewiſe plead, that
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:015299_0020_0F98CFFB86512C18"/>
the wares of the Merchant have riſen more in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to former prices than the produce of the Farm, therefore notwithſtanding the high demands he makes for all <hi>his</hi> vendible articles, yet upon the whole he is not a gainer—. Now if this be a fact, that both have enhanced the prices of your commodities, and yet neither gain any thing by it, you muſt be the more inexcuſable ſtill: for if this be the caſe, then you muſt certainly extort for the ſake of op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, even without a temptation! But this ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition will not readily be granted; therefore admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting that neither increaſe your real, or perſonal eſtates, by your preſent trade, yet it is preſumed you ſtill retain your intereſts by grinding the face of the <hi>poor.</hi> So that view the matter in what light you pleaſe, you cannot exculpate yourſelves from blame. What a melancholy caſe is this? Will not theſe words of the Prophet apply to us; <hi>the Lord will enter into judgment with the ancients of his people:—for ye have eaten up the vineyard; the ſpoil of the poor is in your houſes. What mean ye that ye beat my people to pieces, and grind the faces of the poor? ſaith the Lord God of Hoſts.</hi> Are we not the generation, the wiſe man ſpeaks of, <hi>whoſe teeth are as ſwords, and their jaw-teeth as knives, to devour the poor from off the earth, and the needy from among men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Theſe are ſome of the evils that individuals ſuffer by the preſent Extortion—but if we conſider it in a more public view, how greatly does it injure, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>danger the community? It affects the public in theſe ſeveral ways.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It diſcourages, and makes uneaſy all thoſe, who are oppreſſed; and has a natural tendency to create di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions, and deſtroy that harmony and union, in which the ſtrength and happineſs of ſocieties greatly conſiſt.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:015299_0021_0F98CFFC47A55DF0"/>2. It enhances the prices of almoſt every Article, neceſſary for the public ſupply—for which there is now the greateſt demand; and conſequently, <hi>ama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zingly</hi> increaſes the public debt—. And here, if I miſtake not, the Extortioner is a ſinner againſt himſelf; for to diſcharge the load he muſt in time, at leaſt refund a ſhare of his unrighteous gain.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Theſe things occaſion the Emiſſion of ſuch floods of Paper-Currency, as neceſſarily depreciates its own value; and ſo much the more involves the public in difficulty. So that in fact, Extortion moſt rapidly increaſes the debt, depreciates the Currency, and ſinks the credit of the public; and conſequently is the greateſt impolicy. And unleſs a ſpeedy ſtop can be put to its progreſs, by ſome means or other, it will ſoon bring inevitable ruin upon the public, and render the increaſing burthens of thouſands quite intolerable! But where then is our boaſted love for our country? Where our <hi>patriotiſm,</hi> and pretended zeal for the public good? Have not theſe been tipped about from tongue to tongue? Was all this feigned? or was it a dream or mere deluſion? or was it a cloak to hide a ſpirit as ſelfiſh as —<hi>man?</hi> Were indifferent beings to view our conduct, what would they think of us? Were the falſe colourings, with which men paint their actions to be wiped off, and the maſk fairly taken away, would not the high pretenſions of <hi>patriotiſm,</hi> and zeal for the public good, of multitudes appear to be little more than ambition and hypocriſy? Inſtead of love and zeal for our country, would not craft, avarice, and ſelf intereſt immediately be thrown to view? Inſtead of honeſty, purity of heart, and benovelence, ſhould we not ſee partiality, corruption, infidelity, and Extortion of the vileſt kind, ſtalking thro' the land?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:015299_0022_0F98CFFD06400D48"/>But if we conſider the matter in a more religious view, how calamitious and threatning is the preſent aſpect of the times? Can there be a more certain evidence of the decay of religion, and the increaſe of impiety, than the preſent internal oppreſſion? It looks, in ſhort, as if God had in ſome degrees forſaken us. It is certain, ſo far as this iniquity <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, we have forſaken him. The Almighty <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> this abomination; and conſiders it as a reproach againſt himſelf: for <hi>he that oppreſſeth the poor, reproacheth his maker: but he that honoreth him, hath mercy on the poor.</hi> Have we not reaſon to tremble at the threatnings once denounced againſt Jeruſalem for like ſins? <hi>Caſt a mount about her, ſaid the Lord of hoſts, this is the city to be viſited, ſhe is wholly oppreſſion in the midſt of her. As a fountain caſteth out her waters, ſo ſhe caſteth out her wickedneſs: violence and ſpoil is heard in her, before me continually is grief and wounds. Be inſtructed, O Jeruſalem, leſt my ſoul depart from thee: leſt I make thee deſolate, a land not inhabited.</hi> Jeruſalem would not hear the voice of the Lord: and that great city, once the glory of the world, is no more! O that we might be wiſe enough to ſhun the rocks, which others have ſplit againſt, leſt we ſhare the ſame fate!— But what can the Extortioner expect? Nay, what can he pray for? Let his profeſſions be what they may, to be conſiſtent with himſelf, his prayer, if ever he does pray, muſt be ſomething like this:</p>
            <q>
               <p>O thou, Sovran Lord of the univerſe, accept of a tribute of thanks from thy <hi>profeſſing, worthy ſervant,</hi> who rejoices, that thou haſt permitted thoſe public calamities, which have given ſo happy an opportunity for the exerciſe of my unbounded, avaricious luſts. I congratulate myſelf at what I have already accumulated by extorting from others.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:015299_0023_0F98CFFDC587F460"/>May <hi>my</hi> merchandize ſtill proſper, or <hi>my</hi> huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bandry increaſe: but may <hi>ſcarcity</hi> and <hi>want</hi> ſtill be the fate of my country; and more and more abound. May the time ſpeedily come, when I ſhall be able to <hi>buy the poor for ſilver, and the needy for a pair of ſhoes.</hi> May all my countrymen be brought low; and I be made Lord over them.— O ſatiate my ambitious, avaricious deſires, which are all as unbounded as the Ocean—and give me, if poſſible to live always: but if this may not be granted, tho' I cannot bear the thought of ever dying; and deprecate the horrible idea of parting with my poſſeſſions, yet when I can enjoy my earthly paradiſe no longer, then give me the largeſt portion in the paradiſe above.</p>
            </q>
            <p>How ſhocking to a pious mind would it be, to hear a man in earneſt, addreſs his maker thus! yet I dare appeal to the Extortioner's own conſcience, if he has any, if this does not correſpond with his real deſires? The eſſence of prayer conſiſts in the real deſires of the heart. Let a man expreſs what he will in words, his real prayer is only what he wiſhes.</p>
            <p>But are Merchants, Traders, and Farmers the only ſet of men concerned in our internal oppreſſion? At the time when the Prophet addreſſed the Jews in the text, every order of men among them, each in their own way, whether Prieſts, Rulers, or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, apparently acted from ſiniſter motives; and were promoters of their own calamities, by oppreſſion. Some individuals indeed might have had the fear of God before them: but this number compared

with the whole was doubtleſs ſmall: but taken collectively, every order among them either in a greater or leſs degree were culpable. <hi>From the leaſt of them even unto the greateſt of them every one was given to covetouſneſs.</hi>

            <p>But is this the caſe with every denomination among <hi>us?</hi> are <hi>we</hi> all gone out of the way? Has a ſelfiſh, ambitious, avaricious ſpirit diffuſed its baneful influences thro' <hi>our</hi> land? Do the clergy grow inattentive to the vices of men, and leſs zealous for the Lord of hoſts? have they ſufficiently ſounded the alarm and as loudly exclaimed againſt our own ſins as the ſins of others? have they been as watchful againſt internal oppreſſion, which is the greater evil, as againſt oppreſſion from abroad? <hi>Do they daub with untempered mortar, healing the hurt of the daughter of God's people ſlightly, ſaying peace, peace, when there is no peace?—and do the people love to have it ſo?</hi> Are <hi>our</hi> rulers tinged with the ſame diſpoſition? Are <hi>our</hi> Politicians bending <hi>their</hi> wits, and racking <hi>their</hi> inventions, to exalt themſelves? Are <hi>our</hi> Stateſmen practiſing every ſpecies of State-Craft, to promote ſelf intereſt and ſelf honour?— Have appointments, both in the civil and military departments, been under the influence of ſiniſter views?—has the promotion of Friends and Connections been more attended to, than the public good?—Have many diſgraced their Country, and the office they ſuſtained; while others, who would have done honour to both, have been wholly neglected? Are thoſe, who are employed in public buſineſs, too much actuated by the ſame ſpirit? In a word are <hi>avarice, ambition, and ſelfiſhneſs,</hi> com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined

together, become the governing Principle of the Times? I mean only to put individuals upon ſelf inquiry. I mean not to caſt the leaſt reflection upon any order of men whatever: nor would I willingly ſay a word to ſtir up any groundleſs ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes: For I revere the true Patriot, the Friend to his Country, and the Liberties of mankind: but <hi>deteſt</hi> the man, called by whatever name, "who owes his greatneſs to his country's ruin." But altho' I mean not to charge this crime of Extortion and ſelfiſhneſs upon every man, yet does not the complexion of the times urge us to theſe inquiries? If theſe things be true of <hi>us,</hi> what a <hi>deplorable</hi> ſituation are we in! Our circumſtances urgently requeſt a mournful tear, from every pitying eye, over ourſelves, and our Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try! Without a ſpeedy reformation, how ſoon will the lamentation, of our all benevolent Savior over Jeruſalem, with a little variation, apply to us! <hi>O New-England, New-England, how often would I have gathered thy children together, even as a hen gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not! O that thou hadſt known, even thou, at leaſt in this thy day the things that belong to thy peace! but now they are hid from thine eyes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But let us ſearch our own hearts; examine our own practices; and apply the ſubject more cloſly to ourſelves. Have we not <hi>followed the multitude to do evil,</hi> and greedily gained of our neighbours by Extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, diſtreſſing individuals, and damaging the public? I would not be underſtood to ſuggeſt that the people are worſe here, than in other places: I have no reaſon to think they are. Nor would I have a word, ſaid in this diſcourſe, underſtood as intended to
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:015299_0026_0F98D000C57B7CF8"/>
convey the leaſt perſonal complaint, my Hearers, againſt you—juſtice and gratitude require the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, having experienced much of your kindneſs and liberality, ever ſince I have have had the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to live among you: a grateful ſenſe of which, may I always retain upon my heart.</p>
            <p>But, my Friends, does not extortion abound here as well as in other places? Who can ſay, I have waſhed my hands in Innocence, and am free from this ſin of the times? Have we not more or leſs of the ſame diſpoſition in each of our hearts? I preſume not to clear myſelf; tho' God has indeed, in his wiſe and <hi>merciful</hi> Providence, placed me in a ſituation, where I am not tried with the temptation to exerciſe it. But ſhould the caſe ever be otherwiſe, I humbly pray, and I aſk your prayers for me, that I may be kept from ſo great an evil. If <hi>we</hi> are concerned in this abhorred ſin, let us now pauſe a moment, and reflect what an awful thing it is for us to bring ſuch guilt upon ourſelves, and upon the land!— Let me intreat you by every bowel of mercy, and benevolent paſſion, to conſider what you do!— This life, with all its moſt pleaſurable enjoyments, is but a vapour: and gain, greedily gotten by extor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is but a treaſure of guilt and miſery to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>company you into the eternal world! Will you take ſo much pains, and ſeeming pleaſure in <hi>that</hi> which muſt coſt you the keeneſt, and moſt bitter repentance in this life; or elſe produce a great degree of guilt and anguiſh to torture you in a world to come! For <hi>the Lord hath ſpoken it, and will not go back;—nor covetous—nor extortioners ſhall inherit the kingdom of GOD.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="29" facs="unknown:015299_0027_0F98D00185E5CBD0"/>But you will plead perhaps, that the Merchants began firſt, and therefore you are not to blame. But will this excuſe you? So Eve was firſt in the tranſgreſſion, but did that excuſe Adam, who willingly followed? Will you like him, follow others in ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, and plunge yourſelves into the ſame guilt and miſery; and then as he did caſt all the blame on others? rather than virtuouſly ſtand alone? Perhaps, ſelf-intereſt has ſo biaſed, and prejudiced your minds, that you do not diſcern this evil in yourſelves, tho' you may ſee it in others. And ſome may argue, that as they are obliged to pay exorbitant prices for what they purchaſe, there is no iniquity in aſking the like for what they ſell. But while there are more purchaſers than venders, this way of reaſoning muſt be forever unjuſt. And if it made as much againſt your preſent intereſt as it does for it, would you not readily ſee it? Let us ſuppoſe a caſe. What if the public authority ſhould encourage the extravagant demands of the Merchants; and at the ſame time, force your commodities from you at the former uſual prices? would you not ſee the injuſtice of this? would you ſuffer it? would not every mouth be filled with the cry of oppreſſion? and every exertion be made to ſuppreſs it? Equal injuſtice is now practiſed by the Merchant and Farmer both; and yet you do not feel it, or, if ſenſible of it, do not reform.</p>
            <p>One peculiar aggravation attends this ſin: If thoſe who are guilty of it, ſhould at laſt be ſo happy, as to find repentance and forgiveneſs, yet from it's very nature, it will not admit of reſtitution. How cutting the reflection of a <hi>penitent</hi> juſt going into
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:015299_0028_0F98D00245E0A768"/>
eternity, that he cannot right the injuries of the multitude he has wronged by his extortion!</p>
            <p>But however willing we are to excuſe ourſelves from blame, do we not ſee this ſin in others, and profeſſedly abhor it? Are we not then in danger of being numbered with thoſe the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, <hi>who knowing the judgments of GOD, that they who commit ſuch things are worthy of puniſhment,</hi> and yet <hi>do the ſame?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But you will ſay perhaps, we are not inſenſible of the evil; we acknowledge we have been faulty, —but here we are—. How ſhall we go back? or by what means ſhall we ſtop it's courſe? What will it avail for one to attempt it alone? His con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct will not influence the whole. The conſequence of the attempt, would be his <hi>own</hi> ruin, without effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any good. Each one may therefore ſay, it is not my duty to make the trial. If others would reform, ſo would I—. This is as much as to ſay, when a ſin is become general, it is no ſin in an individual to practiſe it; or that it is no ſin to <hi>follow a multitude to do evil.</hi> But what ſays our bleſſed Savior? <hi>If any man will come after me, let him deny himſelf, and take up his croſs and follow me.</hi> And he that does not comparatively even hate every worldly comfort, and is willing to forego them <hi>all</hi> for the ſake of his duty to God, and his fellow creatures, cannot be Chriſt's diſciple. The meaning is, that whenever our Duty and temporal Intereſt become competitors, the <hi>latter</hi> muſt give way to the <hi>former. For what is a man profited, if he ſhall gain the whole world, and loſe his own Soul? or what ſhall a man give in
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:015299_0029_0F98D00305730CD0"/>
exchange for his Soul?</hi> The benevolent Jeſus gave up even life itſelf to redeem us. And yet we are unwilling to give up a little of our worldly intereſt to redeem our brethren and country from diſtreſs. But we <hi>muſt</hi> deny ourſelves. The voice of reaſon and conſcience, revelation and juſtice, the cries of the poor, and groans of our bleeding Country all require it! And now, my Friends, you have an opportunity to try your virtue. On the one hand, you have temporal intereſt ſtrongly inviting you to comply with the Exorbitancy of the times, on the other, duty to God, compaſſion for the poor, regard for juſtice, and love for your country, all urging you to deſiſt. And now which will you do? Still follow after the <hi>mammon of unrighteouſneſs,</hi> forſake your God, devour the poor, and deſtroy your country, or nobly diſplay your virtue, by every exertion, to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs extortion; and put a ſtop to the increaſing calamities in the land? And even reduce yourſelves to that ſtate of poverty and want, which many, either do or will ſuffer, whom you may have oppreſſed, rather than violate your duty or deal unjuſtly with your fellow men. Or, regardleſs of all theſe benevolent motives, will you like the young man in the goſpel, <hi>go away ſorrowful?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the queſtion ſtill returns, tho' we are all ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible of the evil, yet how ſhall a reformation be effected? What can one do alone? It may be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, if you are all ſenſible of this, you are not alone. Unite therefore in your exertions; fixing it in your minds, that there muſt be a reformation; or elſe we are an undone people. <hi>For all the law,</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>is fulfilled in one word, even this; Thou ſhalt
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:015299_0030_0F98D003C58FDBD0"/>
love thy neighbour as thy ſelf. But if ye bite and devour one another, take heed that ye be not conſumed one of another.</hi> But do you ſay, it is a <hi>difficult thing</hi> to bring about a reformation? and aſk how it ſhall be effected? Let me aſk how you came into this way? Did you find <hi>that</hi> a <hi>difficult</hi> thing? Have not many taken pains to find out the higheſt pitch of exorbitancy, leſt they ſhould not have an equal hand in it? Are there not many, to their ſhame, and remorſe of their own conſciences, were they not <hi>ſeared as with a hot iron,</hi> who have hoard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up their goods, and withheld ſupplies even from the neceſſitous, purpoſely to extort upon them!— Were half the pains taken, and deſires manifeſted to effect a reformation, would it not be done? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire therefore how this extortion aroſe, and go back the ſame way.</p>
            <p>But you will ſay perhaps, the evil is now become general; and conſequently a ſtop cannot be put to it, unleſs the whole are agreed.</p>
            <p>It is become too general, we grant, and therefore the more calamitous! But how came this to be ſo? Was it not produced by the influence of individuals? All public ſins become general in the ſame way—. A total declenſion never took place in an inſtant. Theſe evils begin firſt with a few individuals— and by their influence diffuſe themſelves, and become general by degrees.—So it is with reformations: they have always began with individuals. If a reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was not to commence, without the concurrent voice of the community, we might deſpair of it forever. If there is any ſuch thing as reaſoning from
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:015299_0031_0F98D00485940250"/>
Analogy, we can in this way have no reaſon ever to expect it. To reform a community is for indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals to begin, and act with all the influence they have. "Such is our ſtate," as one obſerves, <q>that each individual has a proportion of influence on ſome neighbour at leaſt; he on another, and ſo on; as in a river the following drop urges that which is before; and every one through the whole length of the ſtream, has the like influence. We know not what individuals may do. We are not at liberty to lie dormant until we can at once influence the whole. We muſt begin with the weight we have. Should the little ſprings neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect to flow till a general agreement ſhould take place, the torrent that now bears down all be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it, would never be formed. Theſe mighty floods have their riſe in ſingle drops from the rocks, which uniting creep along till they meet with another combination ſo ſmall that it might be abſorbed by the traveller's foot: Theſe unite, proceed and enlarge 'till mountains tremble at their ſound! Let us receive inſtruction from the ſtream.</q> You know not therefore what you may do till you make the experiment. If you would exert your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, unite, combine, exclaim againſt the abhorred evil, and manifeſt your deteſtation of it by your own example, who can tell what effect it might have? Should you, with a ſingle eye to the honor of God, the happineſs of your fellow-creatures, and good of your country, nobly reſolve by divine grace to loſe all, ſuffer every thing, and even become beggars, rather than follow the multitude in ſin, who knows but thro' your influence a general reformation might take place? And what a glorious thing would that be! You would no doubt be the happier for it to
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:015299_0032_0F98D005458164B0"/>
all eternity! Should you be unſucceſsful in the at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt, yet ſtill remember it is inexpreſſibly better to be ſingularly virtuous, than faſhionably vile; and infinitely more glorious to ſtand alone in a good cauſe with a conſcience <hi>unſpotted from the world,</hi> than to follow the current of vice, with numberleſs millions for our companions. The teſtimony of a good conſcience in death will be infinitely preferable to thouſands of worlds like this. It will be but a poor conſolation in the regions of deſpair, that we did but follow the multitude. As the damned are no doubt tormenters of one another, ſo the more companions there in miſery the greater will be the ſufferings. Dives in Hell deprecated his brethren's coming there, no doubt, leſt his own miſery ſhould be encreaſed. Be entreated then to take this matter into your ſerious conſideration, as we muſt all anſwer for our conduct at the bar at GOD another day!</p>
            <p>It is ſaid, the public Authority have taken the matter under their conſiderations. What will be the reſult of their deliberations and debates upon it we know not.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Since the above diſcourſe was delivered, the General Court have paſſed an act, regulating all capital articles of trade, and produce of the country; which, tho' it cannot alter the diſpoſition of the people, yet if ſtrictly obſerved, muſt put a check upon the ruinous avarice, and extortion of the times.—It affords us a melancholy reflection, that our degeneracy has become ſo exceedingly great, within the ſpace of two years, as to require ſuch an extraordinary meaſure! Nothing but dire neceſſity, we may preſume, would induce the Court to make the attempt.</p>
                  <p>The operation of this act will, perhaps, for the preſent, affect the private intereſt of ſome individuals. But notwithſtanding this, whoever conſiders the difficulty of framing ſuch a bill, and at the ſame time, the abſolute neceſſity of it, under our preſent circumſtances, if a friend to juſtice, his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and his country, can he do leſs than exert himſelf to the utmoſt to carry it into execution? As few excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions perhaps can be taken againſt it, as againſt any bill of ſuch a nature, that might be formed.</p>
                  <p>Can the generous ſoul, the chriſtian, the friend of man, and lover of his country, be ſo deſtitute of public virtue, ſo ſelfiſh, contracted, and unjuſt, as to ſee his neighbour de<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>voured, the poor of the land fail, and his country ſink in ruin, rather than forego a little of his own private intereſt to prevent ſuch amazing calamities! Charity forbids the thought!—</p>
               </note> Perhaps they will effect more, than
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:015299_0033_0F98D006059152D0"/>
by many is expected. It doubtleſs behooves them, I ſpeak with freedom, and boldneſs, to mark out the peoples duty by their own Example. And does it not equally become the Miniſters of the Goſpel, Merchants, Traders, Farmers, and every other de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomination of men, to rouſe up, and exert them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to the utmoſt, in their particular ſpheres, to ſtop the growing evil, which threatens deſtruction to our country? But whatever others may do, let us reſolve, thro' Chriſt, whatever may be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, that we <hi>will ſerve the Lord.</hi> Let what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever will await us here, let us thro' the Redeemer ſecure an intereſt in <hi>a better country, even an hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly one.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But perhaps all that has been ſaid will have little or no effect. Our public virtue and true concern for our country may be ſo weak, our affections and charity ſo cold; and our temptations, and paſſion for the world ſo ſtrong and urgent, that after all the warnings we have had, we ſhall ſtill perhaps continue
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:015299_0034_0F98D006C75C6258"/>
in the ſame courſe, as did the Jews, till involved in compleat deſtruction!</p>
            <p>But <hi>whether you will hear, or forbear,</hi> God commands his Miniſters <hi>to cry aloud, and not ſpare to ſhow his people their tranſgreſſions.</hi> I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſioned in the ſervice of Chriſt; and ye are wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſes, that I am ſworn to be faithful. Therefore, while I have a finger to write, or tongue to ſpeak, <hi>Chriſt Jeſus ſtrengthning me,</hi> I will ſpeak, declare, and bear teſtimony againſt the abominations of the land.</p>
            <p>I therefore again urge your attention to this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant affair. The cauſe I am pleading is the cauſe of GOD, and my country, the cauſe of the poor and oppreſſed. I am this day an advocate for the poor, the widow, and the fatherleſs. My heart akes for the diſtreſſed! I tremble for my Country! and for all of you, my Hearers, who are involved in the general guilt! O my dearly beloved flock, for whoſe <hi>ſouls</hi> I am to <hi>watch, as one that muſt give an account,</hi> be intreated; by the tender mercies of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to come out from among the ſins, and abominations of the times, of every deno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination. Methinks, the voice of God to you is, <hi>come out, my people, from among them, and be ye ſeparate; touch not the unclean thing; and I will receive you. Come out from among them,—be no longer partaker of their ſins, leſt ye be partaker of their plagues!</hi> I therefore again beſeech your attention to this matter: and urge you, by every bond of chriſtianity, equity and juſtice—by every tender feeling of humanity, and compaſſion for the poor; and by every tie of love and friendſhip to your country to deſiſt
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:015299_0035_0F98D0078571EFA8"/>
from extortion, and oppreſſion of every kind! Let the expreſſive threatening and encouraging language of the ſacred ſcriptures, deter you from this evil;— <hi>For he that by unjuſt gain increaſeth his ſubſtance, ſhall gather it for him that will pity the poor.— Wo to him that coveteth an evil covetouſneſs to his houſe,—that he may be delivered from the power of evil.—He that oppreſſeth the poor to increaſe his riches, ſhall ſurely come to want.—For the oppreſſion of the poor, and the ſighing of the needy, now will I ariſe, ſaith the Lord.</hi>—And <hi>I will be a ſwift witneſs againſt thoſe that oppreſs the hireling in his wages, the widow, and the fatherleſs.—But he that deſpiſeth the gain of oppreſſion, that ſhaketh his hands from holding of bribes, that ſtoppeth his ear from hearing of blood, and ſhutteth his eyes from ſeeing of evil: He ſhall dwell on high: his place of defence ſhall be the munition of rocks, bread ſhall be given him, his waters ſhall be ſure.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I would once more urge your moſt ſpeedy and vigorous efforts to ſuppreſs the growing calamity, from a conſideration of the goodneſs, and mercy of God toward us thro' the courſe of the laſt year, as we would wiſh for a more happy one in the enſuing. The favor of God hath been extended towards us in numberleſs inſtances. Have we not been carried thro' another calamitous year; and ſtill live to praiſe him, while thouſands, who lived the laſt New-Year's Day are no more! What is the language of divine goodneſs in this? Is it not expreſſed in theſe words of our Savior? <hi>This is my commandment that ye love one another, as I have loved you.</hi> But where is our love if we bite and
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:015299_0036_0F98D008460D8F80"/>
devour one another? Great and important events are before us, which, as ſome imagine, will in a great meaſure determine our public controverſy, either for or againſt us before the year cloſes, upon which we have this day entered. Who of us may live to ſee it, God alone knows! O let us ſuffer the things then, which have been ſuggeſted, deeply to impreſs, and affect our minds, as we would hope for the ſmiles of Providence upon us, and our land. O may every one, who has a heart to pray, moſt devoutly ſolicit the throne of grace, that God, for Chriſt's ſake, would pour out a ſpirit of reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion upon us, and upon our land. For, according to all human probabilities, unleſs this takes place, we are a devoted, undone people! Should the time come, in which we ſhall all ſee it, then I truſt you will be witneſſes for me, that in this particular, I am free from the blood of my Country, and of your Souls.</p>
