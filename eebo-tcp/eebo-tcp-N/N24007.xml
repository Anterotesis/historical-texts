            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE following Diſcourſes, for ſubſtance, were delivered in the place where the writer ſtatedly miniſters. What was meant only for a ſingle congregation, is, by the deſire of the hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, now made public. Whether the Book which chriſtians take for their guide, is from heaven or of men, is an inquiry of the higheſt importance; and in which not a few, at the preſent time, feel deeply intereſted from oppoſite motives. This ſhort ſummary of the principal arguments in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of revealed religion, is indebted to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fences which have gone before it, and claims no advance in a ſubject which has employed ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny abler pens. It is hoped that this compendious view may be uſeful to ſome who have not had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to the large treatiſes, which have been pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed on the truth and inſpiration of the Bible.</p>

               <p>MINISTERS of the goſpel are under high and peculiar obligations, in every age of the church, to bear public teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony in favor of the truth and divine ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal of the religion which they are called to preach. The performance of this duty
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:031762_0004_0FEE3D93D09B28E0"/>muſt lie with uncommon weight upon their minds at the preſent time; when not a few in America, and vaſt numbers on the eaſtern continent, who were educated in the belief of chriſtianity, openly reprobate it, as the offspring of fraud or ſuperſtition. It is well known that the diſciples of infidelity are multiplying daily, and that they are induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triouſly employed in throwing doubts and ſcruples relative to the holy ſcriptures, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the minds of thoſe who have not, as yet, gone over to their ſide. Whoever has his eyes open to diſcern the moral complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion of the day, and is friendly to the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent and future welfare of mankind, will feel no ſmall concern for the riſing generation in particular. Their inexperience, and the warmth of their paſſions render them liable to become an eaſy prey to thoſe licentious opinions, which are highly pleaſing to the corrupt taſte of the human heart.</p>
               <p>I REQUEST of you, my young friends, as well as of perſons of every age, a candid, ſerious, and patient hearing, while I adduce ſome of the leading evidences in ſupport of the truth and inſpiration of the Bible, in a more ample manner than I have hitherto done in my public diſcourſes. In proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting this deſign ſome things will be intro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:031762_0005_0FEE3DA732F5A780"/>which may not, ſeparately conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, be thought very intereſting; but I hope it will appear in the final reſult, that they are neceſſary parts of the general ſubject on which I am entering.</p>
               <p>IF the bible be a piece of prieſtcraft, or the work of diſhoneſt politicians, let it be given up, and ſink into contempt: But if it be from heaven, as we have the fulleſt evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to believe, let it be received with all the reverence due to THE WORD OF THE LORD. Not all the art or ſophiſtry of men will be able to overthrow a book that was dictated by infinite truth: And the guilt of thoſe who make the attempt will be awfully great; for they will be found even to fight againſt God!</p>
               <p>THOSE perſons in chriſtian countries who acknowledge the exiſtence of one God, but deny all revealed religion, have adopted the name of <hi>Deiſts.</hi> They are far from being agreed among themſelves, except in the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle point of denying the divine original of the ſcriptures. A conſiderable number of deiſts in the laſt and preſent century, have appeared as writers againſt the truth and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of the bible. Some of them were men of acuteneſs and learning; ſuch as Lord Herbert, the Earl of Shaftſbury, Lord
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031762_0006_0FEE3DB402712EE0"/>Bolingbroke, Chubb, Hume, Voltaire, Roſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeau, and others. Our country has not giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en birth to any deiſtical writer of much note. Mr. Thomas Paine, whoſe zeal for infidelity is well known, was born and educated in England. On his leaving the United States of America, a few years ſince, he repaired to France, where he ſoon found the leaders of a large and powerful nation, as warmly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged as himſelf for the downfal of the chriſtian religion, and the propagation of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidelity through the world. Thoſe perſons who have read Mr. Paine's "Age of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon," the firſt and ſecond parts, have no cauſe to doubt that he has ſpoken the lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage of his heart; for he has gone ſo far as to utter an oath in a formal manner that he is a deiſt. On his darling theme he has ſtarted little or nothing new, nor has he hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led the ſubject ſo ably as ſeveral who went be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore him; but in impudence and ridicule he has few equals. It is much eaſier to deal in confident aſſertions, or to raiſe a laugh among the thoughtleſs, than to offer rational con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction to the mind.</p>
               <p>IT cannot be queſtioned that many are fond of calling themſelves deiſts or infidels, becauſe they have heard that ſome great men have done ſo heretofore, or are doing ſo at
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031762_0007_0FEE3DBB15A496A0"/>the preſent time; though they have never read a ſyllable that they wrote, and are wholly ignorant of the arguments which they employ in ſupport of their cauſe. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſions to infidelity are eaſily made among thoſe who are void of principle, or are galled by ſcripture reproofs, or are determined to indulge their luſts. Hence it need not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear ſtrange, that in a ſeaſon of general li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs, many openly renounce the pure religion that came from above.</p>
               <p>A LOOSE way of thinking on moral and religious ſubjects has a ſtrong tendency to blind the mind, and harden the heart. In the hiſtory of the New Teſtament frequent mention is made of the <hi>Sadducees,</hi> a ſect who denied a future ſtate, the reſurrection of the body, and the exiſtence of angel or ſpirit. They were among the moſt bitter enemies of Chriſt and his apoſtles. I find no ſatisfactory proof of the converſion of one of them to chriſtianity. When any have deliberately become unbelievers in the truth and divinity of the ſcriptures, they have ſeldom been reclaimed. In moſt inſtances they have proceeded from bad to worſe, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til according to human appearance, they have cut themſelves off from hope. God, who hath the hearts of all men in his hand,
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031762_0008_0FEE3DA0AE3E6CB8"/>is able to arreſt infidels of the higheſt claſs in their courſe, and ſubdue them by his grace; but we need ſtronger evidence than has yet appeared, to be ſanguine in our ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations that any of them will be recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from the error of their way. There is room to hope that ſuch as are infidels through inattention may be excited to careful inqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and eſcape from the ſnare in which they have begun to be entangled; and that thoſe whoſe faith is wavering may be ſettled in the belief that the bible is true and from God. Thoſe who have an anxious deſire to be ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfied on ſo important a ſubject, will liſten with avidity to every attempt to diſcover the grounds on which the ſcriptures may be defended, againſt thoſe who condemn them as fraught with cunningly deviſed fables.</p>
               <p>PIOUS chriſtians are fully ſatisfied that the religion which they have embraced is of divine original; but the holy exerciſes of their hearts are not to be held up before infidels for their conviction. The latter will ſay, (and they will declare a fact not to be doubted) that they know nothing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the feelings of chriſtian piety. Hence it may be expected that they will conſider all who profeſs ſuch feelings as enthuſiaſts, and unworthy of notice. Recourſe muſt be
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:031762_0009_0FEE3DBCAB91A7F0"/>had to argument; both to eſtabliſh the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion in diſpute, and to remove objections. The faithful witneſſes, though it has been their lot to propheſy a long time clothed in ſackcloth, will not withhold their teſtimony in favor of the oracles of God. Being not aſhamed of their hope they will labor to produce ſuch reaſons for its ſupport, as may ſilence, if they do not convince, gainſayers. The glory of God, and the felicity of his holy intelligent kingdom, are directly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted by the exhibition of truth, however it may "torment them that dwell on the earth." The friends of revelation feel them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bound to ſtand up in its defence: The effects of their exertions they leave with God.</p>
               <p>THE words of the Apoſtle Paul in the text, addreſſed to Timothy, a young miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, may lead us to attend to the arguments by which the ſcriptures are demonſtrated to be true and from God. It is added in the verſe next following, <hi>That the man of God may be perfect, thoroughly furniſhed unto all good works:</hi> The meaning of which is, that Timothy by attending to the evidences and deſign of all ſcripture, would be completely furniſhed, as a chriſtian and a miniſter, for the diſcharge of every duty to which he ſhould be called.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:031762_0010_0FEE3D4C9962C780"/>
WHEN the apoſtle declares that <hi>all ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is given by inſpiration of God,</hi> he has par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular reference to the writings of the Old Teſtament. Theſe were the ſcriptures which Timothy had known from a child, as is mentioned in the verſe preceding the text. At the time when Paul wrote this e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſtle the whole of the new teſtament had not been committed to writing: But ſuch is the connexion between its ſeveral books, and of the whole with the Jewiſh ſcriptures, that the two teſtaments muſt ſtand or fall together. Whatever diſtinct proofs are given of the truth and inſpiration of the new teſtament, and however convincing theſe may be to a total ſtranger to the old teſtament, it is well known to every one who has read the bible with attention, that the four evangeliſts, the acts of the apoſtles, and the epiſtles, abound with quotations from, and alluſions to, the writings of Moſes and the prophets, on the aſſumption that they were dictated by the Holy Ghoſt. Hence, it has always been admitted both by chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians and deiſts, that the two teſtaments are ſo interwoven that they muſt be jointly eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tabliſhed, or given up, as the word of the Lord.</p>
               <p>THE inſpiration of all ſcripture is not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly declared in the text, but its uſe is pointed
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031762_0011_0FEE3DBE5F81CBC0"/>out: <hi>It is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruction in righteouſneſs.</hi> It is profitable <hi>for doctrine,</hi> as it directs us what to believe—<hi>for reproof,</hi> as it appriſes us of ſin and warns us againſt it—<hi>for correction,</hi> as it recals us from wandering—and <hi>for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction in righteouſneſs,</hi> as it inculcates all the duties of piety and virtue, with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per motives to obſerve them.</p>
               <p>IN diſcourſing from the text, at this time, it is propoſed,</p>
               <p n="1">I. To conſider the truth of the ſcriptures of the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
               <p n="2">II. EXPLAIN in what ſenſe the phraſe, <hi>Inſpiration of God,</hi> is to be underſtood when applied to <hi>all ſcripture.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">III. BRING arguments to prove that all ſcripture is given by inſpiration of God.</p>
               <p>UNDER each head it is deſigned to notice ſeveral objections, as we paſs along in the diſcourſes.</p>
               <p n="1">I. LET us conſider the truth of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the Old and New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>EVERY one will eaſily diſcern the propri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety of conſidering the truth of the ſcriptures,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:031762_0012_0FEE3D8FDF50F3D8"/>or the authenticity of theſe writings, in the firſt place: ſince if they could be ſhown to be a forgery, their inſpiration muſt be given up; for God will not bear witneſs in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a falſhood. Beſides, we muſt be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied that the ſcriptures are true, or contain an authentic narration of facts, before we can be warranted to produce arguments from their hiſtory to eſtabliſh their inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation.</p>
               <p>IN the part of the ſubject before us, we are to conſider the apparent candor and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity of the men who are ſaid to have pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned the Bible; the circumſtances attending the facts they narrate; the correſponding ſtate of the world; and the harmony of the ſeveral writers of the ſcriptures, though liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in places and periods remote from each other. To theſe may be added, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of profane writers, or thoſe who have no claim to inſpiration.</p>
               <p>WHEN we undertake to examine the truth of the <hi>Pentateuch,</hi> or the five firſt books of the Bible, ſaid to be written by <hi>Moſes,</hi> we have not the advantage of appeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to any cotemporary writer. That there was ſuch a man as Moſes, a leader in Iſrael, has, I think, never been called in queſtion by any deiſt; and may therefore be taken
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031762_0013_0FEE3D7E12C367E0"/>for granted. He died about fourteen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and fifty years before the birth of Chriſt. There is no profane writer, whoſe works have come down to us, that lived until more than five hundred years after that period, or about the time that Jehoſhaphat reigned in Judah. Herodotus of Greece, is the oldeſt hiſtorian, whoſe writings have eſcaped the ruins of time. He did not flouriſh till more than a thouſand years after the death of Moſes. That father of profane hiſtory did not live until after the return of the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Iſrael from Babylon. There are no writings now extant ſo ancient as the five books of Moſes, unleſs the book of Job be an exception. This is conceded by many of the learned among the deiſts.</p>
               <p>HEATHEN poets and hiſtorians have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded events which reach as far back as the creation. Though they have written in a fabulous ſtrain; it is evident that they allude to facts which were originally taken from the hiſtory of Moſes. Thoſe writers ſpeak of the happy ſtate of man when he was firſt created; they repreſent that he was placed in a delightful garden, and enjoyed all the bleſſings of what they call the golden age. We alſo find in thoſe authors an account of the iron age, or the unhappy ſtate of man
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:031762_0014_0FEE3DC8DEF1EBB8"/>after he had loſt his primeval innocence. Strabo, the Greek geographer, who lived in an early period of the chriſtian era, informs that Alexander the Great, who died a little more than three hundred years before Chriſt, ſent a perſon to enquire into the manners and doctrine of the Bramins, or the Hindoo prieſts in India. The meſſenger found one of that order named Calanus, who taught him, "That in the origin of nature plenty reigned through all the world. Milk, and wine, and honey, and oil flowed from foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains: but men having abuſed this felicity, God deprived them of it, and condemned them to labor for the ſuſtenance of their lives." Similar repreſentations of man's primitive innocence and happineſs, of his fall, and the bitter fruits of it, have been found in the writings of many of the orien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal nations, and in thoſe of the Grecian phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophers, who borrowed their theology from the eaſt. Theſe accounts were evidently handed down by tradition from ſome of the firſt chapters in Geneſis.</p>
               <p>HISTORY and tradition agree with the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in aſcribing to mankind the ſame pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or in deriving them from one pair. The differences in colour have created objections in ſome minds againſt the Moſaic account of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:031762_0015_0FEE3DCCD1E540C8"/>the propagation of the human race. This difficulty is, no doubt, the greateſt that phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſophy can urge. It is certain that climate has ſome influence upon the colour of the ſkin. It is a general fact that the nations who live within the torrid zone are of a darker complexion than the inhabitants of the northern temperate zone. The whites grow darker in the courſe of a few genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions by removing into hot climates. It is well known that the Jews, from their at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to their religion, do not blend with other nations. Experience has determined that thoſe of them who inhabit near the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quator for an age or two, are of a darker hue than their brethren who inhabit colder regions for an equal length of time. It will not follow from the influence of cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate that men will be exactly of the ſame complexion who have, during any given pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod, reſided within the ſame parrallels of latitude; for the ſtate of the atmoſphere may be materially affected by high moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in ſome places, the ſoil, and other cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes. The Africans on the ſlave coaſt, which lies within the torrid zone, are not equally black. Thoſe who are born and brought up near barren ſands, are blacker than thoſe who have been found in fertile places. The heat of the ſun is much more intenſe on the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031762_0016_0FEE3DD0538233A0"/>former ſoil than on the latter. The manner of living has alſo an effect on the complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion. Tribes who dwell in dirty, ſmoky cabins, or huts, are clad with the undreſſed ſkins of beaſts, and feed on filthy food, are more ſwarthy than thoſe nations who dwell in convenient houſes, and practiſe cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in their lodging, apparel, and diet. Hence, we may probably conclude why the American Indians have a darker ſkin than the deſcendants from the Engliſh in the ſame temperate climate; and why the Tartars, and others, that live at the diſtance of a few degrees from the north pole, are more taw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny than the civilized nations that lie further to the ſouth.</p>
               <p>WHETHER a ſatisfactory ſolution of the difficulty to which we have been attending has been hit upon or not, there are ſo many particulars in which the different nations agree, as to faſten the charge of abſurdity on thoſe who deny them to be of one race, from the differences in the colour of their ſkin. Beſide likeneſs of figure and organs, it has been found that men who are diſſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar in complexion are alike in the paſſions and appetites both of body and mind; and that by long cohabitation and ſimilar culture the differences between them are not greater
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031762_0017_0FEE3DD46B25AB68"/>than among thoſe who are confeſſedly of one ſtock. The ſimilarity between the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nations and tribes of men, is much greater than can be diſcerned between any two ſpecies of animals that fall under our notice. By facts which have been long ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumulating, from the reports of thoſe who have moſt extenſively traverſed this globe whether by ſea or land, the evidence that mankind are all of one race has become deciſive.</p>
               <p>ALL nations, that have any records re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, agree in tracing back the original reſidence of their anceſtors at or near that part of Aſia where ſcripture hiſtory places them before their diſperſion. We can find no account of the origin of nations which will bear examination but that recorded in Gen. x. which concludes with the following words, <hi>Theſe are the families of the ſons of Noah, after their generations, in their nations: and by theſe were the nations divided in the earth after the flood.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE antiquity which the Chineſe give to their empire, and to the creation, has long been exploded by the learned, as fabulous. The authentic annals of nations, and the ſtate of the arts and ſciences, beſt agree with the Moſaic chronology.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:031762_0018_0FEE3DD847C99B48"/>
THE memory of the flood, which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened in the days of Noah, is preſerved in the writings and traditions of all the oriental nations. Marks of the deluge are plainly diſcernible in many places. The produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the ocean have been diſcovered in the center of continents, at a great diſtance from the ſea; lodged in high mountains, and in mines and quarries that lie deep in the bowels of the earth. The face of the globe we inhabit appears to have been rent and torn by ſome violent convulſion. The more the ſurface and the interior parts of the earth have been explored, the higher is the evidence that it was once overflown by the waters of the deluge.</p>
               <p>THE diſcoveries of circumnavigators, have removed the difficulties of admitting that the earth was peopled in all parts from the plain in the land of Shinar, a little to the weſt of the Euphrates; on the banks of which river the terreſtrial paradiſe ſtood. The art of navigation was imperfectly underſtood in the days of Moſes, and long after. It never roſe to high perfection until the polar vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue of the loadſtone was known. By diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering that the magnet would point the needle in the mariner's compaſs to the north and ſouth poles, with ſmall variations, the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031762_0019_0FEE3DDC41B98B28"/>way was prepared to venture far from the ſight of land, and to go on diſtant voyages. This diſcovery was not made till more than thirteen hundred years after Chriſt. Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viouſly to that period veſſels might be caught by ſtorms, or the trade winds, and have been driven to remote iſlands, or to this continent. As the mariners had not the means of returning they muſt have remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the places to which they were wafted. Shut out as they were from commerce, and being few in number, they would revert to the rude ſtate in which they have been found. The peopling of this weſtern con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinent, the moſt difficult to account for of any part of the globe, might have been ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected not only by the cauſes juſt named, but by emigrations acroſs the narrow ſtrait that divides Aſia and America. It is now known that the north eaſt part of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, and the north weſt of the latter are di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by a water paſſage of but a few miles in width: and that even ſavages are furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with craft ſufficient for tranſportation.</p>
               <p>THE boaſt which ſome infidels have made of being able to overthrow the bible, by improvements in the natural and civil hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the world, and in philoſophy, is wholly without foundation. Modern diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coveries
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031762_0020_0FEE3DDFCCA40DB0"/>lend their aid in eſtabliſhing, rather than in overthrowing, the Moſaic hiſtory; that part of ſcripture hiſtory which lies at the remoteſt diſtance from us.</p>
               <p>THE extraordinary facts narrated in the pentateuch, conſidered in all their circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, are ſuited to confirm its truth. In this place may be mentioned the plagues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted upon the Egyptians, the drying up of the water of the red ſea to open a paſſage through its channel for the Iſraelites, their forty years journey in the wilderneſs, the manna rained down from heaven to furniſh them with bread, the quails brought round their camp to afford them meat, and the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter that guſhed out of the rock to quench their thirſt. Theſe and ſimilar wonders were wrought to eſtabliſh the belief—That Jehovah, the God of the Hebrews, was the one only living and true God, in oppoſition to the polytheiſm, or idolatry, which reign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among all other nations at that time. Had the ſtory of Moſes been falſe, the ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Iſraelites would have united in detecting the impoſture; and they could not have ſailed of ſucceſs. The known at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment of idolaters to their religion, would not have ſuffered them to be idle ſpectators of events of ſuch importance. The facts aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031762_0021_0FEE3DE3EDD4B638"/>were of a public nature, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore muſt have been overthrown had they been falſe. Beſides, a public appeal was made, every year, to ſome of the moſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable of them, by the feaſt of the paſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over, and the feaſt of tabernacles: The former was deſigned as a ſtanding memorial of the ſalvation of the Iſraelites on the night in which the firſt born of the Egyptians were ſlain; the latter was inſtituted to preſerve the memory of the Iſraelites dwelling in tents in their journey through the wilderneſs. Had Moſes been an impoſtor he would not have appointed annual feaſts to keep events in remembrance, which he knew never had an exiſtence. His acknowledged ſagacity muſt have taught him, that on every return of thoſe occaſions, inquiry would have been awakened, which ſoon would have proved fatal to his ſcheme, had it been built on fraud. His conduct had no appearance like to that of impoſtors; who always attempt to hide their deſigns from the public eye, and to avoid ſcrutiny as far as poſſible.</p>
               <p>ADMITTING human nature to have been the ſame in the days of Moſes as now, would it be poſſible for a man to frame ſuch a ſtory as he delivers and obtain general belief, if the whole were a fiction? would he preſume
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031762_0022_0FEE3DC260177FF8"/>to ſay, that he went into a powerful kingdom and led out thence more than two millions of people—that the ſea was opened to make a paſſage for them on their departure—that their enemies in the purſuit of them were drowned in the ſame channel through which they paſſed on dry ground—that the redee<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med nation were afterwards led forty years in a wilderneſs, where they were miraculouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſupported from Heaven—and that in their defenceleſs ſtate they were protected from their enemies, who came upon them in great numbers with arms in their hands—I ſay, would he have uttered ſuch a ſtory, in caſe he knew the whole to be a lie, with any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation of being believed? Moſes could not have indulged any hope of extenſive or laſting credence, if his whole marvellous ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count were falſe, unleſs he had been a fool or a madman. The ability he diſcovered has cleared him from the imputation of ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of theſe characters from the enemies of revelation.</p>
               <p>GROUNDLESS ſtories, it is true, have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed for a time, but they have always been found to loſe even their temporary credit, when neither fraud nor violence have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented or ſilenced inquiry. Fond as man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind are of the marvellous, they will in a
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031762_0023_0FEE3DE80681D520"/>ſhort time correct their credulity in particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſtances, if they are laid under no re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint in examination; eſpecially when facts ſo notorious as the above are appealed to as proof. Granting, as we muſt, that the over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>throw of one deluſion will not cure the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind of a liability to be deceived again, yet nothing is more true than that the multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude will not hold to any one fable long, when the public evidence which it claims for its ſupport is diſcovered to be falſe. Let one now riſe up in this country, or in any other, with the profeſſed deſign of inculcating a new creed, and appeal to facts in proof as public as were thoſe recorded in the Moſaic wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, he would not be believed long, if the facts which he affirmed were not real; pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided neither ſtratagem nor force were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to blind the eyes of the multitude, or to keep up the credit of the new religion. That the hiſtory of Moſes has been generally believed, and that for a long time, by moſt who have been acquainted with it, is not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by its enemies. We would aſk theſe laſt, on what principle this faith can be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for, if the narration on which it reſts be a forgery? If Moſes were either artful or tyrannical enough to keep the Iſraelites in the dark, he could not have enchained the minds
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:031762_0024_0FEE3DE9E9E54FB0"/>of the ſurrounding nations. The Egyptians in particular, who were at that time the moſt acquainted with ſcience of any nation on the globe, would have exerted themſelves to detect the impoſture, had there been the leaſt proſpect of ſucceſs.</p>
               <p>No man or body of men from the earli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ages to the preſent day, have taken it upon them to point out the time or the place when and where the Moſaic religion was fabricated, if it be a forgery. Why has not this buſineſs been undertaken? It has not been omitted through a want of abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for inveſtigation in ſome infidels. Nor have the adverſaries of the Bible withheld their efforts in the preſent inſtance, through want of hatred of Moſes; for no man has been more reproached and vilified by them than he. It can eaſily be told when, where, and by whom, the Mahometan impoſture was framed. Why, I again aſk, has no one undertaken to unravel the plot of Moſes, if his ſcheme be the offspring of fraud? The true anſwer is, that no man of thought and reflection has ever felt himſelf equal to the taſk. The facts of which his hiſtory is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed are too glaring to be denied.</p>
               <p>THE Iſraelites cannot, with the leaſt co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lour of truth, be conſidered as conſpiring
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:031762_0025_0FEE3DEB9BB4A6C0"/>with Moſes to eſtabliſh a falſe or a ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs ſtory. For though their character, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter they were brought under the Sinai co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant, was not ſo corrupt as that of other nations, it was yet far from being faultleſs. They are repreſented as a murmuring and perverſe people, and very prone to idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. Within a ſhort time after the law had been delivered to them from the mouth of JEHOVAH, with ſolemn and awful majeſty, they, with Aaron at their head, formed a molten calf, and worſhipped it, ſaying, "Theſe be thy gods, O Iſrael, which brought thee up out of the land of Egypt." While they were in the wilderneſs they manifeſted a ſtrong inclination to return to the country where they had been in bondage, and contemplated chooſing a lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to conduct them back into that land of idols. Yet perverſe as that nation was, and reluctant as they were to the worſhip of the Lord, they have borne witneſs to the truth of the hiſtory given of them by Moſes, and ſubſequent Old Teſtament writers. That people bear teſtimony to the ſame facts at the preſent time. Individuals and collective bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies of men wiſh to have their names handed down to poſterity with honor. They ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at the thought of a diſgraceful memory. If we admit that the Iſraelites would lend their aid to a forgery to render themſelves
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:031762_0026_0FEE3DF79E5F6400"/>the objects of reproach to their ſucceſſors, we muſt ſuppoſe that a trait exiſted in their characters, which diſtinguiſhed them eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tially from all the reſt of mankind that have lived from the creation to this day.</p>
               <p>THE writings of Moſes carry all the marks of impartiality. He not only mentions the faults of the nation, but his own faults; and proceeds to tell the particular offence which prevented him from paſſing over Jordan, and leading the tribes into the land of promiſe. Do theſe things carry the marks of a diſhon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt mind? Do they not extort from every candid perſon a confeſſion of the integrity of Moſes?</p>
               <p>AN objection has been brought forward againſt the truth and authenticity of the Pentateuch, from the paſſage recorded in Numbers xii. 3. <hi>Now the man Moſes was very meek, above all the men which were upon the face of the earth.</hi> Upon theſe words Paine remarks, in his uſual ſtyle and ſpirit,
<q>If Moſes ſaid this of himſelf, he was a vain and arrogant coxcomb, and unworthy of credit; and if he did not ſay it, the books are without authority.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this objection it may be replied,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. THAT from the account given of Moſes, it appears that he was a man of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:031762_0027_0FEE3DF931D199E0"/>meekneſs. He bore the inſults of the people at large, and of his brother Aaron and ſiſter Miriam, with a compoſure rarely to be met with even among perſons of real piety. There are certainly occaſions in which a man may appeal to the inoffenſive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and purity of his own character. The reproachful and cruel treatment which Moſes received juſtifies a vindication of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The credibility of other hiſtorians of far leſs worth than he, has not been called in queſtion from the things they have ſpoken in favor of themſelves, when driven to make a defence againſt the tongue of ſlander.</p>
               <p n="2">2nd. THE text in Numb. xii. is inſerted by way of parentheſis, and might have been added by ſome ſubſequent writer of the Bible. The account given of the death and burial of Moſes, in the laſt chapter of Deu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teronomy, muſt have been added by ſome other perſon. Samuel did not write any part of the ſecond book which bears his name. It is not ſuppoſed that he wrote the whole of the firſt. In the xxvth chapter of the firſt book mention is made of his death. If this event be not an anticipation, but is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced in the order or the time in which it happened, the evidence is deciſive that he did not write any more of thoſe books than the
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:031762_0028_0FEE3DFAD312FAF8"/>twenty four chapters preceding. This does nothing towards deſtroying or weakening the truth and authenticy of thoſe books, unleſs it were ſomewhere affirmed in the Bible, that they both and throughout were penned by Samuel. This is no where ſaid. While the canon of ſcripture was unfiniſhed, the ſucceeding writers might add to the parts which preceded. The manner of removing the difficulty urged from Numb. xii. 3, will be eaſily underſtood by a compariſon. Let us ſuppoſe that in ſome future diſtant period, in a new edition of Doctor Ramſay's Hiſtory of the American Revolution, it ſhould be added in a parentheſis, or in a note, that Dr. Ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſay was a man of ſcience, and of an eſtimable character, would this deſtroy or even weaken the credibility of his hiſtory? The application is eaſy to the caſe of Moſes. Some other per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon inſerted the eulogy upon him: which in no way affects the truth of what the deceaſed wrote, unleſs it be an additional confirmation.</p>
               <p>I CONCLUDE this diſcourſe with obſerving that the truth of the Moſaic hiſtory is ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in all the other writings both of the Old Teſtament and the New. The evidence we hope to produce in favor of their truth and authenticity, will corroborate the arguments that have been brought in ſupport of the truth of the five firſt books of the Bible.</p>

               <p>HAVING in my firſt diſcourſe, from the words juſt read, attended to the evidence in ſupport of the truth of the Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaic writings, I now proceed to conſider the truth of the other ſcriptures.</p>
               <p>THAT the Iſraelites once inhabited the land of Canaan is as well known, and as u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niverſally believed by all ſorts of men, as any part of ancient hiſtory. Infidels have never denied this, nor that the Iſraelites were put into poſſeſſion of that country by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering its former inhabitants. On that conqueſt they have raiſed one of their moſt
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:031762_0030_0FEE3E0273841088"/>formidable objections againſt the inſpiration of the Bible. This objection I ſhall conſider in another place. Tho' in conſiſtency with themſelves, they have rejected the account of the miracles which attended the conqueſt, they have admitted the narration in general which is contained in the book of Joſhua, as true.</p>
               <p>AFTER the death of Joſhua followed the rule of the Judges; which was ſucceeded by kingly government. Towards the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline of the kingdom of Judah the hiſtory of other nations becomes more authentic, and corroborates ſcripture hiſtory. After the Babylonian captivity the hiſtory of the Jews is more and more connected with that of the Aſſyrians, the Perſians, the Grecians, and other nations. The return of the Jews from Babylon happened about five hundred and thirty-ſix years before Chriſt. The ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count given of it by Ezra and Nehemiah, whoſe books the deiſts allow to be genuine, confirms the truth of the predictions of Jer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emiah and other prophets to whom were diſcloſed the captivity and return of the Jews, before either of thoſe events took place. Beſides, the writings of Ezra and Nehemiah refer to all the hiſtorical books which relate to the children of Iſrael, from
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:031762_0031_0FEE3E0A16806040"/>the time of Abraham to the days in which they lived. Thus we ſee that the Old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament hiſtory is eſtabliſhed beyond all rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable doubt.</p>
               <p>IN whatever light infidels are diſpoſed to conſider the Jewiſh prophets who lived be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Babylonian captivity, in the time of it, or afterwards, they cannot deny that ſuch perſons exiſted, without executing a taſk which they have never attempted, and that is the overthrow of the whole hiſtory of the Old Teſtament. The prophecies and the hiſtorical books are ſo interwoven that they muſt ſtand or fall together.</p>
               <p>THE difficulties which ariſe from the dates and numbers in the Old Teſtament, are not many; and the few miſtakes in theſe parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars are eaſily accounted for. It would be ſtrange if the tranſcribers of the bible, a book much oftener copied than any other in the world, had in no inſtance erred. The Jews, as well as all the other ancient nations, made uſe of letters to expreſs numbers. The fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gures in arithmetic, with which we are ſo fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miliarly acquainted, are not to be found in the writings of antiquity. They were firſt introduced into Europe from Arabia, about a thouſand years after Chriſt. Several of the letters of the Hebrew Alphabet are very
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:031762_0032_0FEE3E0BA7388AE8"/>much alike in ſhape. A tranſcriber might eaſily miſtake one letter for another, where the ſimilarity between them is very great. An error of this kind might make a numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ical calculation very wide from the truth. The Hebrew letter which ſignifies 4, differs very little in its ſhape from the one which ſignifies 200; and the one which ſtands for 8, from the one which ſtands for 400. The errors in copies of the ſcriptures that are of the numerical kind, do nothing to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards deſtroying the truth of theſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings. It has never been contended that the tranſcribers or printers of the Bible, were un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der immediate unerring ſupernatural influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. Chronological errors, eſpecially in things of ſmall conſequence, have never been conſidered as ſubverſive of profane hiſtory. There is no juſt cauſe why any thing ſhould operate as a valid objection againſt the truth of the ſcriptures, which is conceded to have no weight in ſetting aſide the truth of any other writing. It may be fairly concluded from the perfections of God, that he will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the eſſentials of any book that has a juſt claim to inſpiration. What need we more?</p>
               <p>WITHOUT dwelling any longer upon the truth of the Old Teſtament, I ſhall only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, that when it was cloſed by the proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031762_0033_0FEE3E0D54C07830"/>Malachi, about four hundred years before Chriſt, the Jewiſh church received as au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic the ſame books which we have now in our Bible; and admitted no other as ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical.</p>
               <p>As we come down to the New Teſtament, we fall within a more luminous period than that of Moſes and the prophets.</p>
               <p>WE are witneſſes of the exiſtence of the chriſtian religion. However much this may have been, or is now, deſpiſed, no writer has undertaken to overthrow the belief that a perſon called JESUS CHRIST, made his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance in Paleſtine near 1800 years ago, and that he has had followers in the world, from the time of his entrance on his public miniſtry down to the preſent day. The Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man Empire had reached its zenith, and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſcience had riſen to a higher pitch than in any former period when Jeſus was born. There are now in many hands the writings of poets, orators, and hiſtorians, who flour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed a little before and a little after his birth. Theſe authors are held in high repute by thoſe who have a taſte for the fine arts; and the reading of them continues to form a part of a univerſity education. Evidence can be col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected from ſome of thoſe eminent perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, in ſupport of the truth of the chriſtian ſcriptures.</p>

A QUESTSON may ariſe in this place, in ſome minds, which demands an anſwer, and that is, why the teſtimony of pagans is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to in defence of the goſpel? To this it may be anſwered, that their teſtimony, is the teſtimony of avowed enemies; which according to common ſenſe, and the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved rules of judging, has no ſmall weight. The Heathens cannot be ſuſpected of attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to build up a cauſe which they have ever ſought to deſtroy; or of aiding in the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhment of the facts on which it reſts, unleſs compelled to it by the force of evidence. Let it alſo be remembered here, that the ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frages of pagan writers are not collected to prove that the ſcriptures are given by divine inſpiration, but for the ſingle purpoſe of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming their truth.</p>
               <p>THAT the religion of Jeſus Chriſt did ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſt in as early a period as his followers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend, may be fairly gathered from the wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings of Tacitus, the Roman hiſtorian, which were publiſhed about ſeventy years after Chriſt's death. Speaking of the fire which happened at Rome about thirty years after the crucifixion, and of the ſuſpicions that the Emperor Nero enkindled it, he proceeds as follows:
<q>But neither theſe exertions, nor his largeſſes to the people, nor his
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:031762_0035_0FEE3E169540D778"/>offerings to the gods, did away the infa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous imputation under which Nero lay, of having ordered the city to be ſet on fire. To put an end therefore to this report, he laid the guilt, and inflicted the moſt cruel puniſhments upon a ſet of peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, who were held in abhorrence for their crimes, and called by the vulgar, <hi>Chriſtians.</hi> The founder of that name was Chriſt, who ſuffered death in the reign of Tiberius, under his procurator Pontius Pilate. This pernicious ſuperſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, thus checked for a while, broke out again; and ſpread, not only over Judea, where the evil originated, but through Rome alſo, whither every thing bad upon earth finds its way, and is practiſed. Some who confeſſed their ſect were firſt ſeized, and afterwards by their information a vaſt multitude were apprehended, who were convicted, not ſo much of the crime of burning Rome, as of hatred to mankind. Their ſufferings at their execution were aggravated by inſult and mockery, for ſome were diſguiſed in the ſkins of wild beaſts, and worried to death by dogs— ſome were crucified—and others were wrapped in pitched ſhirts, and ſet on fire when the day cloſed, that they might ſerve
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:031762_0036_0FEE3D492E89A2A0"/>as lights to illuminate the night. Nero lent his own gardens for theſe executions; and exhibited at the ſame time a mock circenſian entertainment, being a ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor of the whole in the dreſs of a chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oteer, ſometimes mingling with the crowd on foot, and ſometimes viewing the ſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles from his car. This conduct made the ſufferers pitied; and tho' they were criminals, and deſerved the ſevereſt pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, yet they were conſidered as ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rificed, not ſo much out of a regard to the public good, as to gratify the cruelty of one man.<note n="*" place="bottom">Paley's view of the Evidences of Chriſtianity, Boſton Edition, pages 33, 34.</note>

               <p>THAT Tacitus was a bitter enemy to the chriſtian religion no one can doubt who has attended to the foregoing paſſage. It will follow of courſe that this learned pagan ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſary, would have rejoiced at an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to have proved it to be a fable, had it been poſſible. His teſtimony in ſupport of ſome of the principal facts on which it reſts, could have been extorted by nothing but ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſiſtible evidence. We obſerve that he teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifies that there was ſuch a perſon as Chriſt, that he ſuffered death in the reign of Tibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius, and under the particular government
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:031762_0037_0FEE3DA25019A888"/>of Pilate. He alſo confirms the account given in the New Teſtament of the tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary check of the prevalence of the goſpel, of the ſpread of it afterwards in Judea, the original or firſt ſpot where it was propaga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and of its extending its influence to Rome; where a chriſtian church was gath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ered in the ſame age in which Chriſt was crucified.</p>
               <p>To the teſtimony of Tacitus might be added that of ſeveral other pagan writers. I ſhall only add that of Pliny the younger, the Roman Governor of Bythynia and Pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus, places remote from the capital. His famous letter to Trajan the Emperor, was written about the ſame time with the paſſage adduced from Tacitus; but relates to the affairs of his own time. He ſpeaks of the chriſtian religion, as a religion well known, and as having made very extenſive progreſs in the places under his immediate govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Speaking of the chriſtians, he ſays,
<q>There are many of every age, and of both ſexes—nor has the contagion of this ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition ſeized cities only, but ſmaller towns alſo, and the open country.<note n="*" place="margin">Paley's view, p. 36.</note>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>PLINY in the ſame letter mentions the worſhip of the chriſtians, and gives explicit
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:031762_0038_0FEE3D67727392B8"/>teſtimony to the purity of their morals. He writes,
<q>That having examined the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, ſetting aſide the ſuperſtition of their way, he could find no fault; and that this was the ſum of their error, that they were wont to meet on a fixed day, before light, and ſing a hymn to Chriſt as God, and to bind themſelves by a ſolemn oath or ſacrament, not to any wicked purpoſe; but not to ſteal, nor rob, nor commit a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dultery, nor break their faith, nor detain the pledge.</q>
               </p>
               <p>IT is natural to inquire what teſtimony has been given to the appearing of Jeſus Chriſt, and the progreſs of his religion, by the Jewiſh nation, from which he deſcended as a man. According to the Evangeliſts Chriſt's perſonal miniſtry was almoſt wholly confined to that people, and by their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence he was condemned to die. It is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the Jews ever ſince the coming of Jeſus of Nazareth into the world, have ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted that he was born in the days of Herod the great—that he entered upon his public miniſtry in Judea—that he did many won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful things—that he gained a number of diſciples—that by the inſtigation of their rulers he was put to death—that according to the report of his followers he was reſtored
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:031762_0039_0FEE3E1831FF1668"/>to life on the third day after his crucifixion—and that his religion had an early and extenſive ſpread. The body of the Jewiſh nation did not receive him as the Meſſiah; for they expected, and ſtill expect, a tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral prince under that character. They be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved, in the days in which Jeſus appeared, that if he were the promiſed Shiloh, he would have brought them out from under the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man yoke, and have raiſed their nation to the ſummit of earthly glory. The Saviour whom chriſtians acknowledge, declared, both by words and actions, that his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is not of this world; and condemned in a pointed manner, the reigning corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the faith and practice of the Jews. They rejected this illuſtrious meſſenger of the Lord of hoſts, they charged him with caſting out devils by Beelzebub the prince of devils, and purſued him with implacable malice and rancour until they had brought him to the croſs. We are not therefore to expect honorable mention of Jeſus Chriſt or of his religion by them. Some indeed of the modern Jews acknowledge that the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Meſſiah inculcated many good moral precepts, and juſtly reproach many of his profeſſed followers with a total want of his ſpirit; but they conſider him ſtill as an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtor.
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:031762_0040_0FEE3E19CE843790"/>On the whole, we can collect as much evidence from the Jewiſh nation in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vor of the early exiſtence of the chriſtian re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, as could under all circumſtances be expected; allowing it to be true.</p>
               <p>WHEN we recur to the whole ſeries of chriſtian writers, from the beginning of the chriſtian inſtitution down to the preſent time, we find that they all proceed upon the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eral account, which is contained in our ſcriptures, and upon no other. The ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of Baptiſm and the Lord's Supper, and the Sabbath, have been kept up in the chriſtian church from the time of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles to the day in which we live. The few exceptions found among ſmall and tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rary ſects of chriſtians, do not affect the general argument, or the uſage of the church at large. The foregoing rites conſidered in this connexion, afford no ſmall proof of the facts which they recognize; ſuch as the death and the reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, as ſet forth in the hiſtory of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. We juſtly conſider the declaration of the Independence of the United States of America, as a great and memorable event. Should the day on which it was declared, be marked with peculiar public tokens of reſpect from generation to generation, will
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:031762_0041_0FEE3E1B67C73A40"/>not evidence be fairly collected hundreds of years hence, by thoſe who ſhall then live, that the political birth of our republic hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened on the 4th of July 1776? The appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to the ſubject which this ſuppoſition is deſigned to illuſtrate, is too plain to be miſunderſtood.</p>
               <p>IN further confirmation of the truth and authenticity of the books of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we find the four goſpels written by Matthew, Mark, Luke and John, and the Acts of the Apoſtles, are quoted, or plainly alluded to, by a ſucceſſion of chriſtian wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, beginning with thoſe who lived in the ſame age with the Apoſtles, and continuing through all the ſubſequent periods to the preſent time. By the works of thoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters it appears that the ſtory of the birth, life, miniſtry, death and reſurrection of Chriſt, and the effects that ſoon followed, was the ſame from the firſt as now. Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations from the early ages of the chriſtian church, have been made from the Epiſtles as well as from the hiſtorical books of the New Teſtament. Whoever receives the hiſtorical books as authentic and genuine, cannot juſtly doubt concerning the Epiſtles; for the latter proceed on the ſuppoſition of the truth of the former: as muſt appear to
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:031762_0042_0FEE3E21EAC70CC0"/>every one who attentively reads the New Teſtament. Its hiſtorical books are quoted, or plainly alluded to, by Barnabas, Clement of Rome, Hermas, Ignatius, and Polycarp, as we find by their writings that have come down to us. Thoſe fathers, as is generally admitted, were cotemporary with the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, and were the hearers and companions of ſome one or more of the twelve. In the ſecond century from the birth of Chriſt, we collect teſtimony of the kind now under conſideration from the writings of Juſtin Martyr, Irenoeus, Theophilus, Clement of Alexandria, and Tertullian. In the third century, quotations from, and references to, the New Teſtament, are numerous in the chriſtian writers of that period: among whom are to be enumerated Origen, Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius, and Cyprian. As we advance far into the fourth century, we find the books written by chriſtians to be as full of ſcripture paſſages, as the printed ſermons of modern divines; it is therefore unneceſſary to name any more chriſtian writers under this head. If we be ſatisfied by the teſtimonies in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the truth and authenticity of the New Teſtament, that can be adduced from the firſt three centuries, we ſhall find nothing to perplex our belief in the ages that have fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="45" facs="unknown:031762_0043_0FEE3D7222E7D250"/>
THE force of the teſtimony which has been brought, is greatly ſtrengthened by the agreement of the ſeveral writers with each other, in their references to the books of the New Teſtament. They alſo refer to thoſe books as clothed with <hi>divine</hi> authority, and conſider the ſcriptures as the <hi>only</hi> wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings which are given by inſpiration of God. If it ſhould be ſaid that the writers of the ſecond century were kept from contradicting themſelves, or others, in quoting from the New Teſtament, by attending to the quota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions made by the writers of the firſt centu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, and that the writers of the third century obſerved the ſame precaution it may be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. 1ſt. That ſuch an agreement in a forgery, if the goſpel be falſe, among ſuch numbers, in places ſo remote from each other, and for three hundred years, is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a parallel in the annals of mankind; and ſince no miraculous evidence is appealed to for the proof of ſuch an unprecedented fact, the objection has no weight. 2d. The chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian writers of the firſt century lived in coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries remote from each other. Clement flouriſhed at Rome, Ignatius at Antioch, and Polycarp at Smyrna.</p>
               <p>THE identity or ſameneſs of the chriſtian ſtory, in every age ſince it was firſt promul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated,
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:031762_0044_0FEE3E2777C22F68"/>may be fairly concluded from the early collection of the books of the New Teſtament into a diſtinct volume, and the uſe that was made of them. They were publicly read and expounded in the religious aſſemblies of the chriſtians who lived in the early ages. Commentaries were written up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them; and they were tranſlated into dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent languages. Attempts were alſo made in the infancy of the chriſtian church, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile with each other the different accounts of the four evangeliſts, as recorded in the copy which we have in our hands.</p>
               <p>THE uſe that was made of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in the controverſies that aroſe early in the chriſtian church, tends to the confirmation of the ſubject we are now conſidering. The ſeveral parties appealed to the ſame writings for proof of their reſpective opinions. Moſt even of the heretics acknowledged the whole of the New Teſtament; and the few who did not, received the greater part of it as true, and of divine original. It is eaſy to ſee that the different opinioniſts who had a reſpect for the ſame ſcriptures, to which they had equal acceſs, would ſerve as a check upon each other, againſt attempting any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teration of thoſe writings, had they been ſo diſpoſed. We argue with certainty in this
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:031762_0045_0FEE3E2B3A7D1948"/>caſe, becauſe we build upon the known feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of human nature. To render the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter plain, let us come down to controverſies among chriſtians with which we are ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted. Should the Preſbyterians attempt an alteration of thoſe texts which the Epiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>copalians employ in ſupport of their cauſe, the latter would not fail to detect and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe the fraud. The ſame remark may be made with reſpect to the vigilance of the Preſbyterians, in caſe the Epiſcopalians were guilty of the like fraudulent conduct. Were the Pedobaptiſts, or thoſe who hold to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Baptiſm, to add to, or diminiſh from, the words in the Bible, on which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy between them and the Baptiſts turn, the latter would hold up the deſigned de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception to the world. Were the Baptiſts to alter the diſputed paſſages, the Pedobaptiſts would expoſe the forgery, or eraſement. What ever evils have flown from the diviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ions in the chriſtian church, we diſcern that good has come out of them in this one re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect at leaſt—The preſervation of the ſacred volume from being corrupted.</p>
               <p>IN this connexion we may ſee, that a ſat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>isfactory anſwer can be given to the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing inquiry, which we ſometimes hear,
<q>How ſhall illiterate people know that the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:031762_0046_0FEE3E2D97F8EEB0"/>preſent copies of the Bible, in the original tongues in which they were written, or in the tranſlation which they have are juſt? As they have no knowledge of thoſe an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient languages, how do they know but that they are deceived about the text?</q> To this it may be replied—that perſons who are unacquainted with the languages in which the ſcriptures were firſt written, have no juſt cauſe to fear that any material errors have crept into the Hebrew or Greek copies, or into their tranſlations; becauſe learned men of various denominations, and who are, ſome of them, very wide apart in ſentiment, appeal to the ſame ſcriptures in their original tongues; and conſtantly ſerve as ſpies upon each other againſt any alteration of moment, either in the tranſcribing or tranſlating of them. The preſent tranſlation of the Bible into our language, is acknowledged by learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men of different denominations, to be done with great judgment and impartiality. The few who have wiſhed to raiſe an outcry againſt it, have not been highly reſpected by chriſtians in general, for their attachment to revealed religion. The preſent tranſlation was finiſhed almoſt two hundred years ago.</p>
               <p>IT is indeed true that a knowledge of the languages in which the ſcriptures were firſt
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:031762_0047_0FEE3D6907C36188"/>written, will be helpful in underſtanding them; becauſe the tranſlators were not wholly clear from miſtakes; and more eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially becauſe there are idioms in every language, or peculiar forms of ſpeech, that cannot be completely expreſſed in any other. But the Bible is ſo tranſlated, that no one will be led into any material error by the preſent verſion.</p>
               <p>RETURNING from digreſſion, I proceed to obſerve that the ſame hiſtorical books of the New Teſtament, which we have in our hands, were early attacked by the adverſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of our religion; as by Celſus, in the ſecond century, Porphyry, in the third, and Julian the apoſtate, in the fourth. Theſe learned pagans do not hint at any other hiſtories as received among chriſtians, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the life, miniſtry, death, and reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, of Jeſus Chriſt, and the propagation of his religion, but thoſe contained in the four Evangeliſts, and in the Acts of the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles. Their violent enmity to the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian religion, would have led them to deſtroy or weaken the authenticity of the books which its friends received, had it been in their power. As they never attempted this, but built their objections on the ſame books
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:031762_0048_0FEE3E3135B63A98"/>which are contained in our copies, the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is concluſive that the hiſtorical records to which chriſtians appealed then, were the ſame which we now have.</p>
               <p>To the foregoing arguments may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded—that many formal catalogues of au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thentic ſcriptures were publiſhed within four hundred years from the birth of Chriſt, by his followers, which contain all the books both of the Old and New Teſtament, that are received by chriſtians, as canonical at the preſent time.</p>
               <p>IT is well known to all who have gone far into the inquiry concerning the truth and authenticity of the New Teſtament, that many ſpurious or apocryphal writings ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in ſome of the early ages of chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, under the names of the Evangeliſts, A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, and other perſons. Such fictions may be accounted for, from the fondneſs of the human mind to enlarge on a marvellous ſtory that had begun to engage general at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in many places, and from lucrative motives. We have certain proof that thoſe forgeries were never received by the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church as canonical. They did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear in the firſt century from the birth of Chriſt; in which all the hiſtorical books of the New Teſtament were univerſally known
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:031762_0049_0FEE3E3BF1E41070"/>and received by chriſtians. Primitive chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians never appear to have had any doubt concerning the truth and genuineneſs of the four Evangeliſts, and the Acts of the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles, which contain the principal facts on which the goſpel reſts. Of the apocryphal writings few have been preſerved entire to the preſent time. From theſe, as well as from the fragments of the reſt to be collect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from other writers, thoſe ſpurious pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, the moſt of them, are diſcovered to be full of trifling, ſilly ſtories and contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions, and to be compoſed in a very dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſtyle from the books which chriſtians receive. It is however apparent from all thoſe forgeries, that they allude to the ſame general hiſtory of Chriſt and his Apoſtles which is contained in the New Teſtament. None of the apocryphal writings were ever admitted into the ſame volume with the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonical books, nor into the catalogues of authentic ſcripture that have been publiſhed. They were not noticed by the adverſaries of the chriſtian religion in its infancy, nor were they appealed to, as an authority, by any of the ancient chriſtian writers, in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſies with each other.<note n="*" place="bottom">The reader who wiſhes to go into a full examination of the truth and authenticity of the New Teſtament, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred to the authorities which have principally guided the writer of theſe diſcourſes, on that ſubject, viz. Jones's new and full method of ſettling the canonical authority of the New Teſtament, and Paley's view of the Evidences of Chriſtianity. The author regrets that he has not had ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs to Lardner's Credibility of the goſpel hiſtory.</note>

THE differences in the accounts given by the Evangeliſts concerning the life, miniſtry death and reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt create no objection to the truth of their hiſtory. Some circumſtances are mentioned by one Evangeliſt which are omitted by another; but on examination it is found that they are all conſiſtent with the general ſtory, and with each other. Differences in hiſtory are not neceſſarily conſidered as contradictions. Two or more writers on the American Rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olution, may mention different facts, and yet their narrations may be harmonious. The genealogies of Chriſt given by Matthew and Luke are different; but they are reconciled with truth, by conſidering that Matthew gives the genealogy of Chriſt in the line of Joſeph his reputed father, and Luke traces it in the line of Mary his real mother. The differences in the accounts given by the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vangeliſts of the Reſurrection of Chriſt, are reconcileable with each other.</p>
               <p>THE evidence of the truth of the hiſtori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of the New Teſtament is greater, than if they all had mentioned the ſame facts and
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:031762_0051_0FEE3E3F5A4A4920"/>no other. In that caſe it might have been objected with more appearance of plauſibil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, that they wrote in concert with a deſign to make out one ſtory, to impoſe on man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. When a number of witneſſes teſtify to a complicated fact, before a court of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, preciſely in the ſame words and with the ſame circumſtances, a ſuſpicion more eaſily ariſes in the minds of the Judges, of colluſion and fraud in the perſons who give teſtimony, than when they employ different words, and bring up different circumſtances that are reconcileable with the general fact, and with each other, and caſt light upon the whole affair.</p>
               <p>IF any will be ſo abſurd as to diſcredit the Evangeliſts becauſe they narrate events that happened long ago, they muſt, to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent reject all ancient hiſtory. They muſt diſbelieve that there ever were ſuch men as Cyrus, Alexander the great, or Julius Ceſar; for if their exiſtence be admitted, credit muſt be given to ſome of the records of ancient times. We all admit many things to be true of which we have not been eye-witneſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es, on human teſtimony. If the witneſſes be credible, we do not withhold our aſſent to what they teſtify, becauſe the facts they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm happened at a time, or in a place, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:031762_0052_0FEE3E40F859CBE8"/>from us. If we will allow nothing to be true that has not been immediately ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed to our ſenſes, our knowledge will be confined within very narrow bounds in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed.—We of this audience, on that ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, ought not to believe that there are ſuch places as London, Paris, or Amſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam; for we have not beheld them with our own eyes.</p>
               <p>INFIDELS, in ſome of their objections a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Bible, have fallen into modes of reaſoning relative to facts, which they would be aſhamed to adopt when applied to any other ſubject. Hence, we have grounds to ſuſpect that they are governed by a wiſh to prove the ſcriptures to be falſe, rather than by the candor which they profeſs to take for their guide. They urge the ſupernat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ural events narrated in ſacred hiſtory as a ſufficient bar againſt admitting its truth. Mr. Hume, a deiſt of great ſubtilty, has la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bored to prove that experience is the only guide, to be relied on, in reaſoning concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing matters of fact. If he mean by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, what falls under each man's particular obſervation, he muſt go all the abſurd lengths of diſcrediting the exiſtence of every thing which is not known either by the immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate teſtimony of the external ſenſes, or the
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:031762_0053_0FEE3E4472754068"/>immediate perceptions of the mind. If Mr. Hume acted upon his own ſcheme in the ſenſe in which it is now taken, he certainly did not believe in any part of ancient hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, except in things daily occurring; ſuch as the riſing and ſetting of the ſun, the eb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bing and flowing of the tide, the change of the ſeaſons, &amp;c. Nor did he expect that the readers of his hiſtory of England, would give credit to a large part of it, unleſs gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erned by the credulity which he explodes. If by experience be meant the uſual courſe of events, it will follow that no report which relates to an uncommon event ought to be believed. On this hypotheſis, we have no ſufficient grounds to believe that King Charles I. of England, was beheaded in the year 1649, or that Louis XVI. of France loſt his life on the ſcaffold in 1793. It has not been uſual for kings to loſe their lives by the hand of the executioner, after the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities of a law trial; and as we were not preſent when either of thoſe monarchs is ſaid to have had his head ſtruck off, we are juſtified in rejecting the report as a fable. Such abſurd conſequences as theſe will fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low from the principles laid down by the moſt ſubtle deiſts, for the purpoſe of deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the credibility of miracles. If the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of theſe is inadmiſſible, the Bible
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:031762_0054_0FEE3E4DAD594C78"/>muſt be renounced as given by divine inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
               <p>THE portion of underſtanding which is ſo equally diſtributed among mankind, is fully competent to decide on the evidence deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from facts which take place before their eyes. None of the intricacies of abſtract reaſoning are needed in ſuch caſes. This remark agrees with the known ſenſe of all judicial bodies on the earth. To the ſame common ſenſe I appeal, whether the Apoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tles and other witneſſes of the facts recorded in the hiſtory of the New Teſtament, were not competent judges of the truth of what they aſſert? If they were, their teſtimony is to be received as valid; unleſs it can be ſet aſide from ſomething that appears in their characters, or in the circumſtances which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend their narration. No juſt objection can ariſe from either of theſe quarters, when we candidly attend to the caſe. The truth of the ſcriptures is fully eſtabliſhed by admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, as all men do when not bewildered by ſophiſtry or prejudice, that credible human teſtimony is the ſole criterion of the truth of facts otherwiſe unknown. By this plain and approved ſtandard, we are willing that the truth of the ſcriptures ſhould be tried—We need not fear the reſult.</p>

THE candor and impartiality of the writers of the New Teſtament, are too manifeſt to be denied. They narrate their own faults, without endeavoring to palliate them. This exonerates them from the charge of attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to impoſe a forgery on the world. To this they had no inducement. The religion they publiſhed condemns falſehood in the ſtrongeſt terms, and dooms liars and deceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in particular, to eternal miſery. But had they been ſo hardened, as to have been in no fear from the judgment to come, they had no temporal inducement to ſupport their zeal for the propagation of the goſpel: for by becoming the open advocates of it, they had to renounce the pleaſures, the riches, and the honors, of the world, and expoſed themſelves to meet death in its moſt dreadful forms. But after all, had they been diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed to deceive mankind with a falſe ſtory, it would have been wholly impracticable under the exiſting circumſtances. They publiſhed their hiſtory on the ſcene of action—they appealed to public facts—and they made the appeal while the facts were recent. Their enemies, who had both knowledge and pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, would have unveiled the plot, had their ſcheme been built on a lie. The rulers of the Jewiſh nation were, as a body, wholly oppoſed to chriſtianity, and would have
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:031762_0056_0FEE3D4ADDC34340"/>cruſhed it in the birth had their malice been able to have accompliſhed its wiſhes. Had the religion of Jeſus been a fraud, it would ſoon, like other frauds that are deteſted by thoſe in power, have periſhed from the earth. We are not to confine the ſcene to Judea, where chriſtianity was firſt diſplayed, it was carried into the leſſer Aſia, into Greece and Rome and other places, within a few years after the death of its founder. The malice, the learning, and the prejudices of Heathens as well as Jews were exerted againſt it. Its propagation was not in dark and obſcure places, but in the moſt noted places then in the world. It was too in the day when the famous Roman Empire had brought not only Judea, but all countries of much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown, to bow to her arms, and to pour their riches into her treaſury. At the ſame time that ſhe extended her ſceptre over the world, ſhe reigned miſtreſs of the arts.
<q>At the time when Chriſt appeared, the Roman Empire had reached the very meridian of its glory. It was the illuſtrious peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>od, when power and policy receiving aid from learning and ſcience, and embeliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from the orators and the poets, gave law to the world, directed its taſte, and even controled its opinions. It was the age when inquiry was awake and active
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:031762_0057_0FEE3E50DFD379E8"/>on every ſubject that was ſuppoſed to be of curious or uſeful inveſtigation, wheth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in the natural or in the intellectual world. It was, in ſhort, ſuch an age as impoſture muſt have found in every reſpect the leaſt auſpicious to its deſigns; eſpecially ſuch an impoſture as chriſtian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity, if it had deſerved the name.<note n="*" place="bottom">White's Sermons, containing a view of Chriſtianity and Mahometaniſm, in their Hiſtory, their Evidence, and their Effects, p. 133, 134.</note>

               <p>IN the two former diſcourſes from the text, we have attended to the truth of the ſcriptures of the Old and New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. I now proceed,</p>
               <p n="2">II. To explain in what ſenſe the phraſe <hi>Inſpiration of God,</hi> is to be underſtood when applied to <hi>all ſcripture.</hi>

BY <hi>inſpiration</hi> is to be underſtood, either an immediate communication of facts or doctrines from God, to the minds of the men who were employed in delivering the Bible to mankind, or in directing them what to write, or in ſecuring them from er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. They had facts and doctrines commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated to them immediately from God, in ſome inſtances, as much as if it were now communicated to us what, is tranſacting, this moment, at the diſtance of thouſands of miles from us. Whenever they wrote any part of ſcripture they were directed from on High what to record, and at the ſame time they were ſecured from error in what they wrote to guide the faith and the practice of mankind. That part of ſcripture which does not fall under inſpiration in the firſt ſenſe that has been given, falls under it in the two laſt ſenſes; and hence it may be ſaid with ſtrict propriety, <hi>that all ſcripture is given by inſpiration of God,</hi> and forms an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible rule of faith and practice.</p>
               <p>THE meaning of inſpiration firſt given, will be eaſily underſtood by a few examples. To Noah was immediately revealed that a deluge would come upon the earth—To A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, that his ſeed ſhould be afflicted by a people in whoſe land they ſhould be a
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:031762_0060_0FEE3E5C1B5CD260"/>ſtranger, four hundred years—To Moſes, the deliverance of the Iſraelites from their Egyptian bondage by his hand—To Samuel, the overthrow of Saul, and the eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of David on the throne of Iſrael—To Jeremiah, the ſeventy years captivity of the kingdom of Judah—To Paul, the Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian apoſtacy—And to John, the dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the reign of the man of ſin, and the principal events relative to the church to the end of the world. Inſpiration, in this high ſenſe, is not only employed in revealing facts but doctrines; ſuch as the mode of the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine exiſtence, the character and offices of Jeſus Chriſt, the immortality of the ſoul, the future judgment, and the reſurrection of the dead. Under this head may alſo be ranked poſitive precepts, or inſtitutions; whether binding on the Jewiſh or the chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian church.</p>
               <p>THOSE who acknowledge the exiſtence of God, will not deny the poſſibility of his communicating truth to the human mind in this extraordinary manner; whether by viſions, by an audible voice, or in any other way. No perſon demands credit from oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, as having ſuch immediate intercourſe with the Deity, unleſs he evidence his illu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination by means as extraordinary as the
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:031762_0061_0FEE3D1D4D9D1B80"/>way in which he received his knowledge. Hence, we may ſee the importance of mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles to confirm the divine original of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble; as will hereafter be conſidered. We may be under as real obligation to receive as divine what is revealed immediately to others, as tho' it were revealed in the ſame way to us. The evidence that God hath commiſſioned others to ſpeak in his name may be ſo concluſive, as to leave us without excuſe in unbelief. Whether the Moſt High ſpeak to us without, or through, the inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentality of creatures, his voice is the ſame, and his authority is equally binding. His right to be obeyed is not founded on the manner of communicating his will, but in his nature, and in our relation to him. Whenever we have certain proof ſet before us, that the righteous Lord of heaven and earth commands our faith or obedience, we are forbidden to withhold our homage a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle moment.</p>
               <p>IN defining inſpiration it was obſerved, in the ſecond place, that the men who penned the ſcriptures were directed by God what to write. I need make no exception here for ſuch inſtances as that of Baruch, and others, employed by the inſpired men as ſcribes; becauſe theſe laſt were the mere
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:031762_0062_0FEE3E5DAC7AB030"/>organs of the men who took them into their ſervice, and pronounced the words which they wrote. If the Prophets, Evangeliſts, or Apoſtles, were, in any inſtance left to their own diſcretion what to record in the ſcriptures, theſe writings could not, with any propriety, be conſidered throughout as giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by inſpiration of God; as Paul declares in the text. Beſides, if the inſpired men were, in any inſtance, left to their own diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion what to inſert in the Bible, we might mutilate it to ſuch a degree, as to render it a very unmeaning book. This has actually been done by ſome nominal chriſtians. They have profeſſed to believe in the facts and doctrines immediately revealed from heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en; but have conſidered the ſubſequent building upon them in the ſcriptures, as the opinions of fallible men. By treating the ſacred volume in this manner, they have brought it down to ſpeak a language which gives very little offence to open infidels. The approach of the former claſs of perſons to the latter is ſo near, as to render the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference ſcarcely diſcernible; and paves the way for their complete union.</p>
               <p>IN perfect conſiſtency with what has been ſaid, it is admitted, that the Prophets, the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:031762_0063_0FEE3D37B13267F8"/>Evangeliſts, and the Apoſtles, might have a knowledge of many things inſerted in the canon, by their own obſervation, and the accounts given them by other men. The revelations made to the patriarchs, and the facts handed down from one generation to another, probably were the ſources through which Moſes was furniſhed with matter for the book of Geneſis. At the ſame time he was directed by omniſcience what to record. This ſuperintending influence of the Holy Ghoſt, gave the ſame authority to what he wrote, as tho' it had been immediately com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to his mind.</p>
               <p>THE third ſenſe in which inſpiration is taken, and that is, ſecuring the ſacred pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men from error in what they wrote, is as neceſſary, as the former ones, to give to the ſcriptures the divine authority which they claim, in every thing that relates to our re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious faith and practice. Whatever doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines or laws may be ſuppoſed to have been given by the Moſt High, we can have no ſatisfactory evidence of their divine original, if the men who are ſaid to have recorded them, were not ſecured from error in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting them to writing.</p>
               <p>IT may be obſerved here, that the infalli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility of the ſcriptures is confined to the <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious</hi>
                  <pb n="67" facs="unknown:031762_0064_0FEE3DB0D54E0A60"/>inſtruction which they contain. As they were revealed as much for the benefit of the unlearned as the learned, they are not employed in teaching human ſcience, or in correcting errors relative to it. Matters of this kind are but incidentally mentioned, and always for moral purpoſes. It is whol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly foreign to their deſign to decide on the diſputes in natural philoſophy or aſtronomy. They leave theſe, and ſimilar things, as they find them. They, for inſtance, ſpeak of the riſing and the ſetting of the ſun, in a ſtile which is familiar to all mankind, and in the ſame manner which is uſed, even by thoſe who have gone fartheſt in the ſtudy of the kingdom of nature, at the preſent day.</p>
               <p>IT is not contended that the perſons who were inſpired to write the Bible, were free from ſin or error, conſidered as <hi>men;</hi> for their faults and miſtakes ſtand on the ſacred pages. Even a meek Moſes offended, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the abode of the Iſraelites at Kadeſh, when he ſaid to them, "muſt <hi>we</hi> fetch you water out of this rock?" David, who wrote moſt of the Pſalms, committed an atrocious crime in the matter of Uriah. Peter deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his Lord and Maſter, and at the ſame time horribly tranſgreſſed the third com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment. The other inſpired men ſaid
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:031762_0065_0FEE3D3AE65C7710"/>and did enough to convince all who have read their hiſtory, that they were men of like paſſions with others. But, as they were under <hi>the immediate or ſuperintending in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of inſpiration,</hi> they uttered nothing but what is true; either as matter of fact, or doctrine, or warning, or promiſe, or threatning, or is, in ſome way, related to the deſign of the author of the ſcriptures, in giving them to the human race. The ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred penmen declared facts when they told their own ſins. The evangeliſts are to be credited, when they inform of the diſputes among the Apoſtles, who ſhould be the greateſt in the Meſſiah's kingdom, and of their ignorance of its nature. It is as really the deſign of the Holy Spirit to have the ſins, the follies, and the ignorance, of pious men, expoſed, whether inſpired or not, as to have doctrines and precepts recorded. It will appear, by a little reflexion, that thoſe blemiſhes may be improved to enforce the reproof and the correction named in the text. When we ſee a Moſes, a David, and a Peter, offend, is not the warning of the Apoſtle highly enforced, <hi>Let him that thinketh he ſtandeth take heed leſt he fall?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE words and actions of Satan and wicked men are recorded in the ſcriptures;
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:031762_0066_0FEE3E6764EE8378"/>to lay open their characters, to juſtify God in puniſhing, and to warn againſt traveling in the path of his enemies. It is declared of the devil, "That he was a murderer from the beginning; and that he is a liar, and the father of it." We find this character exemplified in the hiſtory which is given of him. He came with the malicious deſign of a murderer, to our mother Eve, and with a lie in his mouth, when he ſaid, <hi>ye ſhall not ſurely die.</hi> This firſt lie that was ever told in our world, has often been repeated ſince; and the tempter ſtill continues to attempt the ruin of the human race by fraud and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice. Is there a falſe, ſubtle, a malicious, and a potent, enemy to mankind, conſtantly going about like a roaring lion, ſeeking whom he may devour? And is it not wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of divine wiſdom and goodneſs, to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and warn the human race of his deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tructive deſign? How can this be done, without giving to us ſome knowledge of the diſpoſition of the adverſary, and the evils he has introduced? It was certainly a high proof of the benevolence and mercy of Chriſt, when he ſaid to Peter, "Simon, Simon, behold Satan hath deſired to have you, that he may ſift you as wheat; but I have prayed for thee, that thy faith fail not."</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="70" facs="unknown:031762_0067_0FEE3D479CD09E10"/>
WE have ſet before us the character of the wicked generation that lived in Noah's time, in Abraham's, and in ſubſequent ages previous to the coming of Chriſt, and ſince; to illuſtrate the depravity of the human heart, to proclaim the righteouſneſs of God in taking vengeance, and to diſplay the riches of his grace towards the ſaved. We are moreover warned by ſuch repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions againſt truſting in man, and are coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelled to put our truſt in the living God. Particular examples of wickedneſs in perſons of different ranks and ſtations, and ſome of them under the beſt external advantages, or under the moſt ſolemn admonitions, are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to convince us of the obſtinacy of ſinners, and that the change which is wrought in the renewed is effected by the ſovereign mercy of God. A hardened Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raoh, a blaſpheming Rabſhakeh, a proud Nebuchadnezzar, a cruel Herod, and a treacherous Judas, ſtand as ſo many beacons, to reprove and warn mankind. It is as wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of infinite truth and purity to delineate ſuch characters, as thoſe of a meek Moſes, a pious Hezekiah, a faithful Daniel, a believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Simeon, and an amiable John. When we behold ourſelves compaſſed about with ſo great a cloud of witneſſes, as ſacred hiſtory points out to us, we have every inducement
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:031762_0068_0FEE3E69092CB588"/>to lay aſide every weight, and the ſin which doth ſo eaſily beſet us, and to run with pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience the chriſtian race.</p>
               <p>IF any will go about to vilify the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, becauſe they contain an account of the corruptions of the human race, they betray great ignorance and wickedneſs. Such repreſentations as the Bible contains on this ſubject, are ſo far from fixing a ſtain on the character of Jehovah, that, in the connexion in which they ſtand, they paint his hatred of ſin in the moſt glaring co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lours. No perſon of an honeſt heart, and who is tolerably acquainted with the ſacred writings, can long remain at a loſs what things are held up in them to be imitated, and what to be avoided. The ſcriptures collectively may be ſtiled <hi>The Word of the LORD,</hi> as they inform us, what the Lord di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rects us to believe, what to practiſe, and what to ſhun. Their general deſign is the ſame; whether they are delivered in the form of doctrine, precept, or hiſtory.</p>
               <p>A LARGE proportion of the Bible is hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical. This form of writing is well ſuited to engage the mind of the reader, as it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municates inſtruction in a pleaſing manner. Of the truth of this every one may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, by reflecting on the effects which he
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:031762_0069_0FEE3D65D2163408"/>perceives from liſtening to an intereſting ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Who can avoid being moved in read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the life of Joſeph; the preſervation of Moſes when expoſed on the banks of the river of Egypt, in his infancy; the life of Elijah, and others. The accounts which are given of particular perſons in ſcripture, are not deſigned to amuſe, like a romance; but to afford moral and religious inſtruction. The hiſtory of the birth, life, death, reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, and aſcenſion, of Jeſus Chriſt, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſes events of greater magnitude, and high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er importance, than any other that have been publiſhed in this world.</p>
               <p>SCRIPTURE hiſtory confirms the truth of the prophecies, by conducting us to the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment of many of them. It unfolds the happy tendency of piety and virtue, and the miſery that is derived from ſin. By the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory of the Jewiſh nation, in particular, are exhibited the effects of obedience, and of diſobedience, as they reſpect communities. Peculiar as was the form of government under which that people were placed, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant inſtructions are given by the divine conduct towards them, to all mankind. The riſe and fall of heathen empires, narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in the ſacred writings, proclaim the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of divine providence; and announce,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:031762_0070_0FEE3D4FC4B23988"/>that however nations may be lifted up with their conqueſts and proſperity, they will, ſooner or later, have their reckoning day. The Lord will cauſe the arrogancy of the proud to ceaſe, and will lay low the haugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineſs of the terrible.</p>
               <p>THE long liſts of names which are found in ſeveral of the ſcripture books, are not without uſe. Among the ſeveral purpoſes anſwered by the inſertion of thoſe cata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logues, the two following are obvious, and important: the one is, to confirm the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent of all nations from Shem, Ham, and Japheth; the other is, to evince that Chriſt, as concerning the fleſh, deſcended from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham, in the line of Iſaac and Jacob, the tribe of Judah, and the houſe of David, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeably to prediction and promiſe.</p>
               <p>MANY of the common affairs and occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences of life are recorded in the Bible. Were all theſe excluded, we ſhould not have evidence, at leaſt in its preſent degree, that the ſacred volume was deſigned for the uſe of mankind. It deſcribes them not only with reſpect to their moral ſtate, and future deſtination, but in their various concerns with the preſent world. Our race, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, are repreſented in the ſcriptures, as
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:031762_0071_0FEE3D361F40E678"/>having need of food for ſuſtenance, and rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for clothing, ſo long as they remain on the earth. The neceſſity of theſe is not di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed by poſſeſſing the ſpirit of piety, or of inſpiration. God enjoins in his word a temperate and charitable uſe of worldly goods, but he doth not require that abſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion from them of the living, which can be found only among thoſe who are lodged in the grave. All temporal enjoyments, inclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding natural life, are to be given up, and literally to be parted with, rather than deny Chriſt. At the ſame time it is to be obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, that the ſacrifices which are made of earthly bleſſings to indulge a capricious ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony, are not the fruits of evangelical love, but the offspring of pride. Religioniſts have appeared under the chriſtian name, who have repreſented the perfection of piety as very much conſiſting in "neglecting of the body," and in "abſtaining from meats which God hath created to be received with thankſgiving of them who believe and know the truth." The Apoſtle Paul in writing for the cloak that he left at Troas, for the books, and the parchments, ſhows, that as a man he had the ſame wants, and might be benefitted by the ſame outward convenien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as other men. The inſertion of this paſſage in the ſcriptures, as well as of other
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:031762_0072_0FEE3D7FA4BCA1F0"/>incidents of a like kind, does not appear tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fling, after what has been ſaid on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of introducing in the Bible the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon affairs of life. It is as really the mind of the author of that ſacred book, that ſuch things ſhould be incidentally inſerted, as thoſe that were immediately revealed from on high.</p>
               <p>THERE are ſome things which the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures declare to be lawful, that may not be expedient under certain circumſtances. To a caſe of that kind the Apoſtle Paul refers in 1 Cor. vii. 6. <hi>But I ſpeak this by permiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, and not of commandment.</hi> Under the head of expediency is alſo to be placed the advice of the Apoſtle in the 25th verſe of the ſame chapter, <hi>Now concerning virgins, I have no commandment of the Lord; yet I give my judgment, as one that hath obtained mercy of the Lord to be faithful.</hi> The Apoſtle is here conſidering whether it were eligible for chriſtians to marry while ſuffering perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as they were when he wrote this epiſtle. He gives it as his opinion that it would be better for them to remain in a ſtate of celib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acy. He leaves it, however, with individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als to determine for themſelves. As God hath, by a perpetual law, authorized mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage between the ſexes, without the forbid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:031762_0073_0FEE3D644149BA28"/>degrees of conſanguinity, and where nothing with reſpect to character forbids, the Apoſtle could not be commiſſioned to deliver a prohibitory precept in the preſent inſtance. To the Corinthians, who had written to him to inquire whether it were proper that marriages ſhould go on as uſual among their members, it was of no leſs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance to be informed what was left to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual choice, than to know what was poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively binding on all in other things. The whole church of Chriſt is as really inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the text under conſideration as by any other. Beſides, it is foretold in 1 Tim. iv. that, among the apoſtates in the latter times, there ſhould riſe up thoſe who would <hi>forbid to marry.</hi> This prediction has been verified by the decrees of the church of Rome, and of ſome other nominal chriſtians. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent has therefore ſhown the importance of a ſcripture paſſage, in which an Apoſtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares that God never prohibited marriage in times of perſecution; but that even in ſuch ſeaſons he has left it to the judgment of individual chriſtians, whether to enter into the matrimonial bond or not. If the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going remarks be juſt, it will follow, that the text in queſtion was inſerted in the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble by the ſuperintending influence of the ſpirit of inſpiration.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="77" facs="unknown:031762_0074_0FEE3E6AA0B0E968"/>
WHEN the Apoſtle ſays in the beginning of the 12th verſe, <hi>But to the reſt ſpeak I, not the Lord,</hi> his meaning apparently is, that he was going to deliver ſomething to guide the practice of the church, which had not been before particularly revealed: It is for this reaſon he declares, "ſpeak <hi>I,</hi> not the Lord." That he is ſo to be underſtood, appears from the words which immediately follow in the 12th and 13th verſes compared with the 10th and 11th verſes. The paſſages which ſtand next in order to the clauſe already ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, are, <hi>If any brother hath a wife that believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth not, and ſhe be pleaſed to dwell with him, let him not put her away. And the woman which hath an huſband that believeth not, and if he be pleaſed to dwell with her, let her not leave him.</hi> On the converſion of a huſband, or a wife, from heatheniſm to chriſtianity, a queſtion naturally aroſe, whether the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liever was to renounce matrimonial connex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion with his or her unbelieving correlate, as the Jews who had married idolatrous wives, were commanded to do, in the days of Ezra. The Apoſtle forbids divorces on that ground; and the prohibition that he deliv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, appears to be clothed with the ſame di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine authority as the one named in the 10th and 11th verſes, which contain the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:031762_0075_0FEE3D3952B955C0"/>words, <hi>And unto the married I command, yet not I, but the Lord. Let not the wife de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part from her huſband: But, and if ſhe depart, let her remain unmarried, or be reconciled to her huſband: and let not the huſband put away his wife.</hi> In this laſt quotation, the words "not I, but the <hi>Lord,</hi>" refer to what Chriſt had before ſpoken on the ſubject of divorce, recorded in Matthew v. 32, and xix. 9. Mark x. 11, 12. Luke xvi. 18. With the thoughts kept in mind which have been ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted in anſwer to the difficulties, which have ariſen from ſome parts of the ſeventh chapter of the firſt epiſtle to the Corinthian church, it will, I apprehend, be eaſy to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the whole chapter claims a place in the inſpired volume, as much as any other. If the original penmen of the Bible were, in any inſtance, left to their own diſcretion what to inſert, it will be impoſſible to defend againſt infidels, that <hi>all ſcripture</hi> is given by inſpiration of God, as is affirmed in the text. The Prophets, the Evangeliſts, and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles, when their matter was immediately revealed from on high, or when it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in other ways, were guided by the Holy Ghoſt what to write, and were ſecured from error in writing. I proceed,</p>
               <p n="3">III. To bring arguments to prove that all ſcripture is given by inſpiration of God.</p>
               <p>

THE <hi>firſt</hi> argument may be taken from the nature of the religion contained in the Bible. In this book the Deity is repreſented as a ſpirit, poſſeſſed of an eternal, underived, and independent exiſtence; as being every where preſent at one and the ſame time; as being infinite in knowledge, and in power, and in every other attribute that is neceſſary to conſtitute abſolute greatneſs. JEHOVAH, the God whom chriſtians adore, is not only infinitely great, but infinitely good—He is love. He is the rock, his work is perfect; for all his ways are judgment: a God of truth, and without iniquity; juſt and right is he. He is the LORD, the LORD God, merciful and gracious, long-ſuffering, and abundant in goodneſs and truth. By the word of the LORD were the heavens made; and all the hoſt of them by the breath of his mouth. He gathereth the waters of the ſea together as an heap; he layeth up the depth in ſtorehouſes. Let all the earth fear the LORD; let all the inhabitants of the world ſtand in awe of him: for he ſpake, and it was done, he commanded, and it ſtood faſt. He made the world, and all things therein. He hath made of one blood all nations of men, for to dwell on all the face of the earth, and hath determined the times before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and the bounds of their habitation.
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:031762_0077_0FEE3E73677E65B8"/>In Him all creatures live, and move, and have their being. The counſel of the Lord ſtandeth forever, the thoughts of his heart to all generations. The LORD hath prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his throne in the heavens; and his king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom ruleth over all. The LORD is high a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove all nations, and his glory above the heavens. Promotion cometh neither from the eaſt, nor from the weſt, nor from the ſouth; but God is the Judge: he putteth down one, and ſetteth up another. The Moſt High ruleth in the kingdom of men, and giveth it to whomſoever he will. He is the bleſſed and only Potentate, the King of Kings, and Lord of Lords. He is the one Lawgiver, who is able to ſave, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy. He hath opened a door of hope to a ſinful world through Jeſus Chriſt. By his ſpirit he forms the hearts of ſinners to holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and prepares them for eternal glory. He is the Judge of all the earth, and will render righteous retribution to all intelligent accountable creatures, forever.<note n="*" place="bottom">1 John iv. 16. Deut. xxxii. 4. Exod. xxxiv. 6.

<pb n="81" facs="unknown:031762_0078_0FEE3D81387552C8"/>the LORD our Maker! For the LORD is great, and greatly to be praiſed: he is to be feared above all gods."</p>
               <p>THE moral law, delivered from Mount Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nai, conſiſts of ten precepts; the four firſt of which point out our duty to God, and the ſix laſt our duty to mankind. The ſum of the whole is, to love the Lord our God with all our heart, and with all our ſoul, and with all our ſtrength, and with all our mind; and our neighbor as ourſelves. The ſpirit of this law was binding on man from the creation, and every one of its precepts will remain obligatory upon him for ever. What can be more reaſonable than that an intelligent creature be required to place his ſupreme affections upon that infinite Being, who gave birth to him and all things around him? And preſerves and governs his work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manſhip, and is the ſum of perfection and bleſſedneſs? The other branch of the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al law, which reſpects our neighbor, is built upon truth and equity. The portion of rational moral exiſtence in our fellow-creatures is of as much worth as ours, and deſerves the ſame regard. Beſides, it muſt follow from our ſocial nature, and the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of its indulgence for our happineſs, that if we are ſtrangers to holy love, we
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:031762_0079_0FEE3DA57858CE00"/>cannot enjoy ſociety in perfection, or have any of its pleaſures long continued to us.</p>
               <p>A CODE of laws was given to the Jews, beſide the ten commandments, reſpecting their peculiar government and worſhip, which was deſigned to laſt only until the time of reformation, or the eſtabliſhment of the New Teſtament worſhip; when alſo the lamp of divine truth was to be carried, as we have ſeen to the Gentile nations. The peculiar inſtitutions given to the Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites under the Moſaic economy, were partly adapted to their uncultivated ſtate: ſuch, for inſtance, was that of the cities of refuge, to provide for the ſecurity of thoſe who might undeſignedly take away the life of any perſon. This inſtitution, however, with many others, was deſigned to teach the neceſſity of an atonement for ſinful man, and of his flying to it as the only way of eſcaping from the curſe of God's holy law. Jehovah taught the children of Iſrael, for a long time concerning the advent of the Meſſiah, and the nature of his kingdom, by types and ſhadows. Particular precepts which may appear to us, under our circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, and at our diſtance of time from their exiſtence, of ſmall moment, were of great importance to that people; as calcu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:031762_0080_0FEE3E75047933E0"/>to keep them diſtinct from other na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and to wean them from idolatrous rites, to which they were ſtrongly inclined. We may add, that in all probability, had the Jewiſh ritual been as ſimple as the Chriſtian, the Iſraelites could not have been kept to the obſervance of it in any tolerable degree, with their general character, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a conſtant ſeries of miraculous interpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions: But ſuch conſtant departures from the laws of nature, would, in time, have ceaſed to excite wonder, and the end for which miracles are wrought, would have been defeated.</p>
               <p>WE may determine from the conduct of infinite wiſdom, that it was not proper that divine revelation ſhould communicate all the light to mankind in the days of Moſes, which it has communicated ſince. The communication of truth was gradual, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears from comparing the two Teſtaments together. Light was conſtantly increaſing in the Jewiſh church, by the riſe of new prophets, or the fulfilment of former proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecies, until the Sinai covenant was aboliſhed. Comparatively dark as the ancient diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was, which continued for more than fifteen hundred years, every devout worſhip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per knew, that to obey was better than ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice;
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:031762_0081_0FEE3DA3E4E177A0"/>and that the ſum of duty conſiſts in <hi>doing juſtly, and in loving mercy, and in walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing humbly with God.</hi> The Jews were abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly taught that the Meſſiah would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come incarnate, and dwell among men; and that by his advent light would break forth in greater brightneſs than in any for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer period. Hence, the woman of Sama<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria, who believed in the Old Teſtament, ſaid, in her conference with Chriſt, in John iv. "I know that Meſſias cometh, which is called Chriſt: when he is come, he will tell us all things."</p>
               <p>THE manner in which God is to be wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhipped, as revealed in ſcripture, is pure and rational: and contains an admirable diſplay of infinite majeſty and condeſcenſion. The homage required is adapted to fill the ſoul with holy reverence, and to inſpire it with hope; "For thus ſaith the high and lofty one that inhabiteth eternity, whoſe name is holy, I dwell in the high and holy place, with him alſo that is of a contrite and humble ſpirit, to revive the ſpirit of the humble, and to revive the heart of the contrite ones."<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah lvii. 15.</note>
               </p>
               <p>How apoſtate man may come before the Lord and find acceptance, is a queſtion on
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:031762_0082_0FEE3E7AFAC21D40"/>which the light of nature is wholly ſilent. It is only in the inſpired volume that the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of the <hi>atonement,</hi> which hath been made by the Son of God, is revealed. The mediato<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial plan was promulgated early after the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy of our firſt parents, even before they were baniſhed from the garden of Eden for their diſobedience. In the fulneſs of time the promiſed Saviour appeared in the world, made his ſoul an offering for ſin, roſe from the dead, and aſcended to ſit at the Father's right hand. Through him penitent ſinners draw near to God, are delivered from the wrath to come, and are made heirs of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life. Whatever difficulties attend the expiatory ſcheme exhibited in the goſpel, we may clearly diſcern in it, the infinite purity and rectitude of God's character and law—his hatred of ſin; and the riches of his grace. Theſe prominent features of the ſcripture doctrine of atonement, declare it to be worthy of the wiſdom of the divine mind; and recommend it in the higheſt manner to our fallen race. It is only in conſequence of the interpoſition of Jeſus Chriſt, that any of mankind have obtained the heavenly happineſs; whether before or ſince the actual incarnation of the Son of God: "Neither is there ſalvation in any
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:031762_0083_0FEE3E7E75474C28"/>other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we muſt be ſaved."</p>
               <p>REVELATION brings to light the future exiſtence of man, the reſurrection of the body, the future judgment, and the portion of the juſt and the unjuſt in the world to come. Theſe are ſolemn truths; ſuited to deter the wicked, and to encourage the good patiently to continue in well-doing. Noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſtamps value on time—on man's preſent life, like the eternal ſtate which is to follow; in which each one is to receive from the righteous judge of the living and the dead, according to the deeds done in the body. The puniſhment threatened to the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent is calculated to diſplay the divine holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and juſtice; is fitted to their character, and to excite dread. The reward promiſed to the righteous, correſponds only with the temper of thoſe whoſe hearts are united with the God of love.</p>
               <p>THE piety and virtue inculcated in the oracles of truth, breathe a ſpirit to which the proud and ſelfiſh hearts of mankind are wholly oppoſed. Love to God and man is the root of the graces and virtues, which compoſe the character that meets the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the infinite mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="unknown:031762_0084_0FEED6D5676B8998"/>
THE man whoſe piety is evangelical, makes an unfeigned dedication of himſelf to God; and the feelings of his heart, ſo far as he is ſanctified, fully harmonize with the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine law and government. He approaches his heavenly Father with filial reverence, and can, without reſerve, adopt the form of prayer that Chriſt taught his diſciples;
<q>Our Father who art in heaven, hallowed be thy name: Thy kingdom come: Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven. Give us this day our daily bread. And forgive us our debts as we forgive our debtors. And lead us not into tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but deliver us from evil: For thine is the kingdom, and the power, and the glory, for ever, Amen.</q> This prayer, as one obſerves,
<q>for a ſucceſſion of ſolemn thoughts, for fixing the attention upon a few great points, for ſuitableneſs to every condition, for ſufficiency, for conciſeneſs without obſcurity, for the weight and real importance of its petitions, is without an equal or a rival.</q> The pious man is humble: He feels his abſolute dependence on God for good of every kind. He mourns for ſin, and begs for pardon through Him who died that ſinners might live. While he avoids exerciſing himſelf in things that are too high for him, he makes it his ſtudy to
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:031762_0085_0FEE3D4E2F078918"/>know and do the will of God—to maintain ſobriety—and to keep alive a devotional tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. Taught that he is not his own, and that he is under the wiſe, holy and gracious dominion of the ſovereign Lord of heaven and earth, he denies himſelf, he endures af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flictions with patience, he encounters evils with fortitude, and reſigns every enjoyment to Him who guides the faithful through this diſciplinary ſtate. Not intimidated by the frowns, nor allured by the flatteries of the world, he, by divine aid, holds on his courſe till he finiſhes it with joy. He daily recounts in his cloſet, in ſocial prayer, and in medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, the mercies of the ſupreme benefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and is awakened to gratitude and praiſe. In ſolitary devotion he ſhuns the notice of mortals, ſhuts the door on the noiſe and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs of the world, and prays to his father who is in ſecret. Modeſt and unaſſuming he is far removed from the oſtentatious pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rade of the ancient Phariſees; who profeſſed religion to be ſeen of men, and choſe the corner of the ſtreet, to attract the public no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice while they recited their forms of devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The real diſciple of Jeſus Chriſt does not think highly of his own attainments; but in honor prefers his fellow-chriſtians to himſelf. Knowing that every moral action begins in the heart, he labors to keep it with
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:031762_0086_0FEE3D8E494594B8"/>all diligence, and is incited to watchfulneſs. Being a conſtant witneſs of remaining in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward corruptions, he cenſures himſelf in thouſands of inſtances where he ſtands ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitted in the eyes of mankind.</p>
               <p>CHRISTIANITY breathes a kind, meek, and forgiving ſpirit. The heart of him who is under its influence is moved at the cry of diſtreſs, and his hand is open, according to his ability, to ſupply the wants of the poor, and to alleviate the miſeries of the wretched. In almſgiving he does not ſound a trumpet before him, but, as much as poſſible, diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes his benefactions in ſecret. He does not indulge envy, malice, or revenge; but ſtrives to overcome evil with good. He is not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the government of thoſe paſſions which chaſtity forbids, but looks with abhorrence upon them; as unfitting the mind for pure enjoyment, and the inlet of innumerable e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vils to the human race. In his intercourſe with mankind, he is juſt in his dealings, faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to his engagements, and the fulfilment of the duties of his particular truſt. He bears on his mind and heart the words of Chriſt, in Matthew vii. 12. <hi>Therefore all things what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them: for this is the law and the
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:031762_0087_0FEE3E8195A10878"/>prophets.</hi> The ſpirit of chriſtian virtue tends to the diffuſion of peace and happineſs thro' families, ſocieties, and the great brotherhood of man. How far do the moſt improved in the family of Chriſt on the earth, fall ſhort of the pattern exhibited by his doctrine and example! But imperfect as his followers are, the internal beauty of the goſpel remains; and its influences upon them ſpeak in its praiſe. It is a part of its peculiar glory, to train up men from ſmall beginnings of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to a ſtate of perfect purity and joy.</p>
               <p>IN a review of the argument in ſupport of the inſpiration of the Bible from the reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it contains, it is natural to inquire whence came ſuch a ſcheme of faith and practice?. Where did Moſes and the Iſrael<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ites get ſuch ideas of Deity as are exhibited in the Old Teſtament? They did not derive them from Egypt; for that kingdom was overrun with idolatry during their abode in it. They could not acquire their theology from any of the nations that bordered on Egypt, or Canaan, or from any other then on the earth; for they were all involved in the darkneſs of paganiſm, and remained in that ſtate until the days of the Apoſtles. Hence, the ſacred writers who followed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes could not have been enlightened in the
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:031762_0088_0FEE3E83264881B0"/>knowledge and worſhip of the one living and true God, by any men on the earth. It is well known that the heathens hold to a vaſt number of gods. Athens—learned and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite Athens, is ſaid to have acknowledged deities to the number of thirty thouſand. The objects to which pagans have paid di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine homage, were, many of them fabricated by art; and to all their gods have been attri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted ſenſual appetites, and paſſions, or affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, unworthy of divinity. They are rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſented by thoſe who adore them, as enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged in the amours of the libidinous, and as parties in the quarrels of proud and mali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious men. Many of the heathen rituals enjoined the offering of human ſacrifices; and others encouraged drunkenneſs, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcenity, and whoredom. Some of the wiſer men among the pagans have confeſſed the need of a ſupernatural revelation, to teach mankind how to worſhip the Deity aright. Modern infidels have gloried in the wiſdom of a heathen Socrates. He was indeed one of the moſt deſerving characters that can be found in the annals of pagan antiquity. This renowned philoſopher,
<q>meeting Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibiades, who was going to the temple to pray, proves to him that he knew not how to perform that duty aright, and that therefore it was not ſafe for him to do
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:031762_0089_0FEE3E8C615DABF8"/>it; but that he ſhould wait for a divine inſtructor to teach him how to behave both towards the gods and men; and that it was neceſſary that God ſhould ſcatter the darkneſs which covered his ſoul, that he might be put in a condition to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern good and evil.<note n="*" place="bottom">Leland's View of deiſtical writers, in 2 vol. page 11th of vol. I.</note>
                  </q> Were Socrates a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain to appear in the world, with his for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer belief, he would diſown thoſe as his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, who boaſt of his knowledge, as a proof of the ſufficiency of human reaſon to direct mankind in the duties of piety and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence. But to return, I further aſk, whence came the doctrine of the atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of the reſurrection, and of the future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments, as contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the ſcriptures? Who communicated the piety and virtue which are deſcribed and recommended in theſe writings? No one who is acquainted with the pagan theology, can, with the leaſt colour of reaſon, pretend that the religion of the Bible was copied from the religion of idolaters. Does the ſpirit of the book, whoſe divine original I am endeavoring to maintain, carry the air of human invention? Good men would not impoſe a forgery on the world for truth.
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:031762_0090_0FEE3D1BAFFA1EA8"/>Bad men could not have a ſingle motive to prompt them to deviſe ſuch a ſcheme of faith and practice: For had they knowledge equal to the taſk, they would not have em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed it in the eſtabliſhment of a plan, which expoſes and condemns them in its whole deſign. The drift of all the ſacred books from Geneſis to the Revelation of John, is directly in the face of fraud and ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſpecies of iniquity, both public and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate. Beſides, the humble, pious, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſted, ſpirit of the goſpel, has not one charm to the unholy and the ſelfiſh. To admit that ſuch characters as theſe laſt would invent ſuch a religion, if competent in point of ability, would be as abſurd as to grant, that a malicious man will direct ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery effort to promote the good of the one he inveterately hates, or that a ſelfiſh man will act from diſintereſted motives, or that a cov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etous man will make it his whole aim to be liberal.</p>
               <p>THERE is no anſwer to be given to the queſtion, whence came the religion contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Bible? that can ſatisfy a candid reflecting mind, but this, IT CAME FROM GOD! And therefore the men who announ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced it to the world, ſpake as they were moved by the Holy Ghoſt.</p>

               <p>IN the concluſion of the laſt diſcourſe, was introduced an argument in ſupport of the inſpiration of the Bible, taken from the nature of the religion it contains. Againſt its pure and benevolent nature ſeveral ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections have been brought. I ſhall, in this place, attend to two, raiſed againſt the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rality of certain parts of the Old Teſtament; which are delivered under the ſanction of a divine precept. The difficulties I have in
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:031762_0092_0FEE3E97B643C8E0"/>view, are thoſe which have been ſtarted from the commands which Jehovah gave to the children of Iſrael, to borrow of the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, and to cut off the Canaanites.</p>
               <p>THE firſt of theſe injunctions is recorded in Exodus xi. 2. <hi>Speak now in the ears of the people, and let every man borrow of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bor, and every woman of her neighbor, jewels of ſilver, and jewels of gold.</hi> The Iſraelites practiſed agreeably to the direction received, on the night in which they left Egypt; as we learn from Exodus xii. 35, 36. "And the children of Iſrael did according to the word of Moſes; and they borrowed of the Egyp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians jewels of ſilver, and jewels of gold, and raiment. And the Lord gave the people favor in the ſight of the Egyptians, ſo that they lent unto them ſuch things as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired; and they ſpoiled the Egyptians." It has been ſaid that this conduct is not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable with truth or juſtice, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore God could not authorize it as Moſes declares; and that by certain conſequence it muſt follow, that the book which contains the licence for ſuch practice cannot be given by divine inſpiration. To remove this ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection it may be obſerved,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. THAT the Egyptians had long held the Iſraelites in cruel bondage, and, in point
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:031762_0093_0FEE3E995F0F9960"/>of juſtice, owed them a large compenſation in property, for their ſervice; and to a higher amount than they actually received.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. THE Hebrew verb rendered <hi>borrow,</hi> in the foregoing paſſages, literally ſignifies to <hi>aſk;</hi> and is ſo tranſlated in general.<note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. xxxii. 29. Deut. iv. 32. xxxii. 7. Joſhua iv. 6. Judges xviii. 5. 1 Sam. xii. 19. Pſalm ii. 8. Iſaiah vii. 11.</note> Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to this verſion the difficulty is at once removed. The Iſraelites had certainly an equitable claim on the Egyptians their oppreſſors; and on that ground might aſk of them precious jewels and raiment.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. THE difficulty does not appear in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurmountable, if we allow the word <hi>borrow</hi> to ſtand, as in the Bible which we have in our hands. The Iſraelites were not holden, by any engagement of theirs to return the loan, until they ſhould reach Mount Sinai, where they were to worſhip Jehovah their deliverer. But previouſly to their arrival at that place, Pharaoh and his hoſt purſued them with a hoſtile deſign. The Lord in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpoſed and cut off the king with his army, by drowning them in the red ſea. The Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites could be juſtified in retaining the jewels and the raiment in their poſſeſſion, as the property of a public enemy. Under the
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:031762_0094_0FEE3E9B03588D58"/>exiſting circumſtances, what they firſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived in a way of loan, became ſpoil, and hence their obligation to return it ceaſed.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly. SINCE the earth is the Lord's and the fulneſs thereof, he may transfer his gifts, in an extraordinary, as well as in an ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, manner, if he pleaſe. The plagues in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicted on the Egyptians in their own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and their overthrow at the red ſea, ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved as ſo many miraculous atteſtations in ſupport of the equitable claim of the people whom they had ſo long oppreſſed, upon their goods; and authorized the redeemed na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in holding the jewels and the raiment, which had been put into their hands. None can juſtly plead the caſe we have been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering as a precedent to redreſs their wrongs in the ſame way, unleſs they can produce miracles in their juſtification, as convincing as thoſe that were wrought for the deliverance of the Iſraelites from their Egyptian bondage. The Lord brought them forth with a mighty hand, and with an outſtretched arm, and with great terrible<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and with ſigns, and with wonders. The wrath of Jehovah was awfully diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the puniſhment of the Egyptians. Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in was ſpread over the face of their land, mourning for the death of their firſt-born
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:031762_0095_0FEE3E9CA9475E18"/>was heard from every houſe, and they were ſpoiled of their choiceſt treaſures. The Lord brought forth his people "with ſilver and gold; and there was not one feeble perſon among their tribes. Egypt was glad when they departed; for the fear of them fell up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on them."</p>
               <p>I PROCEED to conſider the difficulty ari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing from the command which Jehovah gave to the children of Iſrael, to deſtroy the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of Canaan. This objection has been accounted the moſt ſpecious of any that has been brought againſt the divine origin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al of the Bible; and has been much inſiſted on by deiſts. They have confidently af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, that the Iſraelites could have no juſt authority to go into Canaan, cut off its in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants by the ſword, and take poſſeſſion of their country; and that if it be admitted that the Iſraelites had righteouſneſs on their ſide, in thus treating a people at peace with them, it will follow that any nation may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive another of all that is dear to them as men, without violating the law of benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. The enemies of divine revelation have alſo dwelt much on the command for the <hi>total</hi> exciſion of the Canaanites, without reſpect to age or ſex, as breathing a ſpirit of cruelty, and therefore unworthy of God.
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:031762_0096_0FEE3EA712F77800"/>I have been the more careful in calling up this objection in its full ſtrength, becauſe of the temporary embarraſſment it has occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned in ſo many minds, when they have begun to inquire into the authority of the ſcriptures. To aſſiſt in removing the diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, let the following things be conſidered.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. THE character of the Canaanites, whom the children of Iſrael were command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to deſtroy. From the account given of them in ſacred hiſtory, it appears that they were groſs idolaters, and were addicted to vices of the moſt enormous kind. They conſulted with familiar ſpirits, and practiſed the arts of ſorcery and witchcraft. There was not a crime that agreed with their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bridled luſts, which they did not ſanction by their idolatrous rites. <hi>Even their ſons and their daughters they burnt in the fire to their gods.</hi> They lived in the open indulgence of fornication, inceſt, and the ſin of Sodom. They even defiled themſelves with the beaſts of the field. Hence Jehovah gave the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing prohibitory precept to the Iſraelites, "Defile not yourſelves in any of theſe things; for in all theſe the nations are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filed which I caſt out before you. And the land is defiled: therefore I do viſit the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity thereof upon it, and the land itſelf
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:031762_0097_0FEE3F239A44DA80"/>vomitteth out her inhabitants."<note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. xviii. 12. Lev. xviii.</note> I know not whether it be poſſible to repreſent a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in a more odious light, than by the fig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of their land <hi>vomitting them out,</hi> as too loathſome to endure on its ſurface.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. IT is evident from the national character of the Canaanites, that they juſtly deſerved deſtruction from the hand of God. His purity and juſtice forbid the laſting proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity of a nation of profligates. The Lord did not ſuffer the Canaanites to be deſtroy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, until they had ripened themſelves for ruin by obſtinate wickedneſs. Near five hundred years before their conqueſt by Joſhua, when God renewed the promiſe to Abraham, that his ſeed ſhould poſſeſs their land, he declared that there would be a ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſion of the performance until ſeveral fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture generations were paſſed away; and for the following reaſon—<hi>The iniquity of the Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orites is not yet full.</hi>
                  <note n="†" place="bottom">Gen. xv. 16.</note> The righteous Lord did not ſuffer them to be cut off till their ſins had long cried aloud for vengeance. Hence, he cautions his people, as in Deut. ix. 4. "Speak not thou in thine heart, after that the Lord thy God hath caſt them out from before thee, ſaying, For my righteouſneſs
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:031762_0098_0FEE3EA8A6ED7828"/>the Lord hath brought me in to poſſeſs this land; but for the wickedneſs of theſe na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the Lord doth drive them out from before thee."</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. IF the Canaanites juſtly deſerved deſtruction from the hand of God, it muſt belong to him to appoint the manner of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flicting it. No one will contend but that the Lord might juſtly have waſted them, both old and young, by ſickneſs, or famine, or have ſunk them by an earthquake: or have deſtroyed them by evils of a ſimilar na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. None can deny that towns and cities have been overthrown in ſuch ways, invol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving each ſex and every age, without diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crimination. The heart that murmurs at the providence which orders ſuch events, as being neither conſiſtent with rectitude nor goodneſs, is actuated by the ſpirit of atheiſm.</p>
               <p>As the execution of the ſentence againſt the wicked lies wholly in the breaſt of the ſupreme Judge, no reaſon can be aſſigned why He might not employ the arms of the Iſraelites, in cutting off the ancient inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of Canaan. Intelligent creatures are as fully under his direction and control as the material world. Beſides, when the former are uſed as the inſtruments in pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhing, the tokens of the divine wrath are
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:031762_0099_0FEE3EAA43B1CD00"/>conſidered as more explicit and dreadful than when evils come through other chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nels. When David was directed to chooſe out of war, famine, or peſtilence, the ſcourge to chaſtiſe him for his ſin in numbering Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rael, he prayed that he might not fall into the hand of man.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly. THAT the Iſraelites were commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by Jehovah to deſtroy the Canaanites, is manifeſt from their hiſtory, after their de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture from Egypt to their paſſing over Jordan. The divine miraculous interpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in their behalf, eſtabliſhes their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion beyond all reaſonable doubt; when taken in connexion with the promiſes God made to Abraham, and other patriarchs who deſcended from him, that the land of Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naan ſhould be given to the poſterity of Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cob for an inheritance. From the words of Rahab the harlot, to the two ſpies whom Joſhua ſent to Jericho, it appears that the inhabitants of Canaan expected that the Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites would conquer and poſſeſs their country, from the wonders wrought for their defence in the wilderneſs. Joſhua ii. 9—11. "And ſhe ſaid unto the men, I know that the Lord hath given you the land, and that your terror is fallen upon us, and that all the inhabitants of the land faint becauſe of
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:031762_0100_0FEE3EB461482C10"/>you. For we have heard how the Lord dried up the water of the red ſea for you, when ye came out of Egypt; and what ye did unto the two kings of the Amorites that were on the other ſide Jordan, Sihon and Og, whom ye utterly deſtroyed. And, as ſoon as we had heard theſe things, our hearts did melt, neither did there remain any more courage in any man, becauſe of you: for the Lord your God, he is God in heaven above, and in earth beneath.</p>
               <p>No objection can remain againſt the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of deſtroying the Canaanites, after can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly attending to their character and deſert, the right of the ſupreme Judge in appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the inſtruments of his vengeance, and the full proof that is furniſhed in ſupport of the commiſſion given to the Iſraelites, to cut off thoſe abandoned nations, and to plant themſelves in their land.</p>
               <p>IF any ſhould inquire why the inſtance we have been conſidering, may not be plead in favor of the Spaniards in deſtroying the aborigines of Mexico and Peru, under Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tez and Pizarro, I anſwer, that it does not appear that thoſe American Indians were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually corrupt with the ancient Canaanites; but on the ſuppoſition that they were, the Spaniards never had an immediate grant
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:031762_0101_0FEE30D783E38778"/>from the ſupreme King, of the countries they invaded, nor had they a divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to kill or enſlave the inhabitants. Thoſe avaricious Europeans could not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce miraculous evidence in ſupport of their claim, or of the war they carried on to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the lands and the gold of the natives; therefore they were guilty of robbery and murder. They could not derive the leaſt countenance from the principles that juſtify the conqueſt of Canaan by Joſhua.</p>
               <p>IF any ſhould pretend to vindicate the ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitous traffic in the human ſpecies, that has been carried on for three hundred years paſt, by the command for the exciſion of the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naanites, let them ſupport their cauſe by miracles as ſtriking as thoſe that were wrought in favor of the children of Iſrael, in the days of Moſes and Joſhua. Let the men who are exploring the coaſts of Africa in queſt of ſlaves, open a paſſage to go on dry ground through wide and deep waters, and arreſt the motions of our planetary ſyſtem, by ſtretching out their hands, or lifting up their voice—I ſay, let them perform theſe or ſimilar miracles in expreſs ſupport of their deſign, or let them deſiſt from carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miſery and wretchedneſs to thoſe ſhores,
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:031762_0102_0FEE3EB611085618"/>as they would avoid the guilt of man-ſteal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and of ſhedding innocent blood.</p>
               <p>IN the deſtruction of the Canaanites, ſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emn warnings were given to the people of Iſrael, and to all other nations to whom the ſcriptures are known, againſt idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try and vice. Is it not worthy of the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, juſtice and goodneſs of God to give ſuch warnings to mankind? Did he not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>play his moral perfections by the deluge, and other judgments recorded in ſcripture hiſtory? The mind of Abraham muſt have been deeply impreſſed with a belief in the holy majeſty of Jehovah, when early in the morning in which Sodom and Gomorrah were wrapped in flames, he beheld the ſmoke of the country going up, as the ſmoke of a furnace. The Lord will make ungodly na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions to drink the cup of his wrath. Jere. xxv. 31. "A noiſe ſhall come even to the ends of the earth: for the Lord hath a contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſy with the nations; he will plead with all fleſh; he will give them that are wicked to the ſword, ſaith the Lord."</p>
               <p>HAVING attempted to obviate the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing objections, I proceed to introduce a <hi>ſec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ond</hi> argument in ſupport of the inſpiration of the ſcriptures, taken from the miracles which they narrate. To theſe, appeals have
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:031762_0103_0FEE3EB7A46E1490"/>already been made, but their nature and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign deſerve a more particular conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; as well as the principal periods of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred hiſtory in which they were wrought.</p>
               <p>A MIRACLE is an event contrary to the laws of nature, or the ſtated courſe of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine operation, and is addreſſed to the exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal ſenſes of mankind. A miracle is as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly within the reach of omnipotence, or is wrought with the ſame eaſe, as any other thing that is brought into exiſtence. Should the Almighty now command the ſun to riſe in the weſt inſtead of the eaſt, the event would be miraculous, becauſe it is contrary to what are denominated the laws of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture. If water were to aſcend a cataract, it would be a reverſion of its common courſe, and therefore a miracle. The miracles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in the ſcriptures, were perceived by thoſe who were preſent when they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed, through the medium of their bodily organs. Thus, the appearances and the voice at Mount Sinai, when the law was giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en, ſtruck the ſenſes of the Iſraelites. When Chriſt walked on the ſea of Galilee, his diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples were eye-witneſſes. No train of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning is neceſſary to convince the ſpectators when a miracle is performed. Its ſudden, extraordinary nature arreſts the attention,
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:031762_0104_0FEE3EBFF569E3A0"/>like the firſt appearance of a blazing comet, or the noiſe of thunder.</p>
               <p>THE apparent deſign of miracles is to ſummon the attention of mankind, to ſome doctrine or duty, revealed or enjoined by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah; and at the ſame time to prove that the perſons who deliver the truths or the laws, are commiſſioned by him. When God ſends meſſengers with ſuch credentials, their meſſage is clothed with his authority, and demands our faith and obedience. Mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acles, though moſt ſtriking to thoſe who were preſent when they were wrought, may be ſo well atteſted, as to anſwer the ſame general purpoſes to others down to the end of the world. They were of high and abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute importance in the eſtabliſhment of the Jewiſh and Chriſtian diſpenſations. To this general deſign may be reduced all the mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles recorded in the Old Teſtament, and in the New.</p>
               <p>WE have no reaſon to expect the renewal of miracles; becauſe the canon of ſcripture has long ſince been cloſed. The preciſe pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod in which miracles ceaſed, I pretend not to determine: But we have no evidence that they were continued beyond the infan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of the chriſtian church.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="109" facs="unknown:031762_0105_0FEE3EC18E7581F0"/>
LET us attend to ſome of the miracles wrought by Moſes. While he was in exile in the land of Midian, where he continued forty years, he led his flock to the back-ſide of the deſert, and came to the mountain of God, even to Horeb. To this humble ſhep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>herd the Angel of the Lord appeared, in a flame of fire, out of the midſt of a buſh; and he looked, and, behold, the buſh burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with fire, and was not conſumed. As he turned aſide to ſee this great ſight, Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah called to him out of the midſt of the buſh, and commanded him to go down into Egypt, to deliver the children of Iſrael from their cruel bondage, and to conduct them unto the good land that he had promiſed to give them. Moſes diſcovered great reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, at firſt, in entering on the work aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him; and urged that his nation would not believe him, but would ſay, "The LORD hath not appeared unto thee." Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hovah directed him to caſt the rod in his hand on the ground. He obeyed; it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came a ſerpent; and he ſled from before it. By the ſame authority, he caught it by the tail, and it again became a rod in his hand. He was next commanded to put his hand in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his boſom; and when he took it out it was leprous as ſnow. He was ordered to put
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:031762_0106_0FEE30F83A466560"/>his hand into his boſom again; and on his plucking it out the ſecond time, it was cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and reſumed the ſame appearance with his other fleſh. Convinced by theſe two ſigns, as well as by other things, of his duty to undertake in the arduous work of deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Iſrael from bondage, he with Aaron his brother, went down into Egypt, in obedience to the divine command. It appears from the hiſtory recorded in Exodus, that Moſes, after his long exile, had given up the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectation which he had entertained forty years before, of delivering the Iſraelites, and that they were looking out for no ſuch thing. This greatly ſtrengthens the credibility of the ſtory. On the refuſal of Pharaoh to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leaſe the Iſraelites from bondage, according to the demand which Jehovah directed Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes to make, Aaron caſt down the rod, which had undergone miraculous changes at Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reb, and it became a ſerpent, in preſence of the Egyptian monarch and his miniſters. Other miracles were afterwards wrought; in turning the waters of Egypt into blood, in filling the land with frogs, and with ſwarms of flies, in the plagues of the hail, and the locuſts, in bringing on a thick dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs over the land of three days continuance, and to name no more, in the death of the firſt born, both of man and beaſt, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:031762_0107_0FEE3EC31E91F168"/>the realm, in one night. Theſe mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, in connexion with thoſe afterwards performed at the red ſea, at Mount Sinai, and other places, until the choſen people were put in poſſeſſion of the land of prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſe, abundantly eſtabliſh the inſpiration of the Old Teſtament. Additional proofs of the ſame kind were afforded, from the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt of Canaan till the days of the prophet Daniel. When Moſes, a little before his death, was exhorting the children of Iſrael to keep the ſtatutes and commandments of the Lord, he reminded them of the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary manner in which God had redeemed them from Egypt, and revealed his will, as high motives for their obedience. He ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealed to the ſigns and wonders which had been ſhown and wrought before their nation, in proof that their Almighty Redeemer was the only true God, and that their religion was from him. Deut. iv. 32—40.
<q>For aſk now of the days that are paſt, which were before thee, ſince the day that God created man upon the earth; and aſk from the one ſide of heaven unto the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, whether there hath been any ſuch thing as this great thing is, or hath been heard like it? Did ever people hear the voice of God ſpeaking out of the midſt of the fire, as thou haſt heard, and live?
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:031762_0108_0FEE30D5E81E10B8"/>Or hath God aſſayed to go and take him a nation from the midſt of another nation, by temptations, by ſigns, and by won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and by war, and by a mighty hand, and by a ſtretched-out arm, and by great terrors, according to all that the Lord your God did for you in Egypt before your eyes? Unto thee it was ſhewed, that thou mighteſt know that the Lord he is God; there is none elſe beſides him. Out of heaven he made thee to hear his voice, that he might inſtruct thee: and upon earth he ſhewed thee his great fire, and thou heardeſt his words out of the midſt of the fire. And becauſe he loved thy fathers, therefore he choſe their ſeed after them, and brought thee out in his ſight with his mighty power out of Egypt; to drive out nations from before thee, greater and mightier than thou art, to bring thee in, to give thee their land for an inheritance, as it is this day. Know, therefore, this day, and conſider it in thine heart, that the Lord he is God in heaven above, and upon the earth beneath: there is none elſe. Thou ſhalt keep, therefore, his ſtatutes, and his commandments, which I command thee this day, that it may go well with thee, and with thy children after thee, and that thou mayeſt prolong thy
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:031762_0109_0FEE3EC6DE1F1710"/>days upon the earth, which the Lord thy God giveth thee, forever.</q>
               </p>
               <p>WHETHER the magicians, mentioned in Exod. vii. and viii. performed real miracles, is a queſtion which has often been brought up in attending to the miracles of Moſes; and has been differently anſwered by divines of high reputation in the Chriſtian Church.</p>
               <p>THOSE who adopt the affirmative ſide of the foregoing queſtion, admit that the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence is eventually full and deciſive in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the divine miſſion of Moſes; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe that the magicians were early con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded in their conteſt with him, and were brought to confeſs that Moſes was furniſhed with divine aſſiſtance. My limits will not permit me to enter largely into this ſubject; I ſhall only ſuggeſt a few reaſons againſt the hypotheſis, that the magicians perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med real miracles.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. IF real miracles are admitted to be wrought on the ſide of thoſe who are enga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged for the ſupport of error and wickedneſs, as the ſuppoſed miracles of the magicians in Egypt were, it will be very difficult to ſhow how miracles do in any caſe confirm the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine miſſion of any perſon, or the divine au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:031762_0110_0FEE3ECF99240900"/>of any ſcheme of religion. Nicode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mus, in the third chapter of John, appears to have ſpoken not only according to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Jews, but agreeably to the dictates of the human mind, when he ſaid to Chriſt, <hi>We know that thou art a teacher come from God; for no man can do theſe miracles that thou doeſt except God be with him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="2">2dly. MOSES diſcovers no marks of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement from any thing that the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians are ſuppoſed to have done, in turning their rods into ſerpents, water into blood, or in bringing up frogs upon the land. But conſidering his very great diffidence in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking the arduous work to which he was called while in Midian, would he not have been greatly agitated, and have been ready to deſpond, if he had believed that the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians were poſſeſſed of a power to do mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acles? How would he have relied on the ſign of changing <hi>his</hi> rod into a ſerpent, as a proof of his divine commiſſion, as the Lord had told him, if the magicians could alſo turn <hi>their</hi> rods into ſerpents?</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. WHATEVER the magicians did, they never went firſt in performing any wonder; but they in their operations always <hi>followed</hi> Moſes. It is certainly much eaſier to imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate than to take the lead, in any thing either
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:031762_0111_0FEE3ED13A5522D0"/>great or rare. Men who compoſed an order of ſuch antiquity and repute among the heathens, as were the magicians, muſt have acquired a dexterity in their art, which far ſurpaſſes any thing that has fallen under our notice.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly. IT plainly appears to us, even at this diſtance of time and place from the ſcene in Pharaoh's court, that in two of the three inſtances in which the magicians imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated Moſes, they wrought on a much ſmal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ler ſcale than he did. When Aaron ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out the rod over the waters of Egypt, the Lord cauſed their ſtreams, rivers, ponds, and all their pools to become blood; and they remained in that ſtate ſeven days. The E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyptians, in that time of diſtreſs, opened wells or ſprings to procure water to drink. The magicians could have but a ſmall quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of water to operate upon. At the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of time when Moſes did his miracle there was no water for them to change, ſo much as in veſſels of wood or ſtone. They might afterwards by their art cauſe the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter taken from a newly opened ſpring or well, to aſſume the appearance of blood. It is affirmed by ſome great naturaliſts now living that a ſmall quantity of water may be made to appear red like blood, by the efforts
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:031762_0112_0FEE3ED2DB403A10"/>of art. In the inſtance of the frogs the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gicians could do very little; becauſe Moſes had before cauſed them to go up from the waters of Egypt, and to cover the land.</p>
               <p n="5">5thly. PHARAOH is conſidered as more criminal for not letting the Iſraelites depart from their bondage, on account of the ſigns and wonders which were ſhown by Moſes and Aaron, even while the magicians imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted their miracles. As a proof of this we need only advert to what is ſaid concerning the Egyptian monarch, that <hi>he hardened his heart,</hi> or that <hi>his heart was hardened.</hi> If the magicians did as real miracles as Moſes, how could Pharaoh's guilt have been increaſed in holding the children of Iſrael in ſlavery, againſt the light reflected upon his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and conſcience by what Moſes did? What evidence could Pharaoh collect from ſigns, which were performed by thoſe who demanded the releaſe of the oppreſſed peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, if his wiſe men who deſigned by their wonderful works to countenance him in his conduct, wrought as real miracles as were performed by Moſes and Aaron? If it ſhould be ſaid that the miracles performed by theſe laſt exceeded thoſe wrought by the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, and therefore Pharaoh was the more criminal in refuſing to let Iſrael go, it may
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:031762_0113_0FEE3ED7617EBCD0"/>be anſwered, that according to this hypoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſis, there was divine evidence againſt divine evidence; which is abſurd and contradicto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Beſides, if Moſes exceeded the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians for the preſent, while the conteſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them continued, how could Pharaoh determine before the trial cloſed, that the latter would not in a future inſtance get the victory over the former? While there was room to doubt, the Egyptian monarch could not be blamed for waiting the iſſue of the conteſt; and conſequently his guilt would not have been increaſed by the miracles of Moſes, during the performance of counter miracles. There appears to be no way to avoid theſe difficulties, but that of denying that the magicians wrought real miracles.</p>
               <p n="6">6thly. PHARAOH never applied to the magicians to take away the plagues while they imitated Moſes; but in every inſtance to the latter. He could not be influenced to this conduct by his native inclination or in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt. How can this behaviour of his be accounted for, except on the ground, that he was compelled to believe that Moſes only was endowed with miraculous powers?</p>
               <p n="7">7thly. THE magicians are expreſsly ſaid, in the three inſtances in which they imitated Moſes, to have wrought <hi>with their inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi>
                  <pb n="118" facs="unknown:031762_0114_0FEE3EDF250AD190"/>The original word rendered <hi>inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> in Exodus vii. and viii. is derived from a verb which ſignifies <hi>to hide,</hi> or <hi>conceal,</hi> and the plural noun derived from it, ſignifies <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cantations,</hi> or <hi>charms,</hi> or <hi>juggling tricks;</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by true appearances are covered, and falſe ones are impoſed on the eyes of the ſpecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. The divine law forbids the uſe of this art; Levit. xix. 26. "Ye ſhall not eat any thing with the blood; <hi>neither ſhall ye uſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chantment,</hi> nor obſerve times." The ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants of Jehovah did not indulge ſuch ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations. Even Balaam, when he found him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf compelled to bleſs the people of Iſrael, inſtead of curſing them according to the wiſhes of his heart, "went not as at other times <hi>to ſeek for inchantments.</hi>"<note n="*" place="bottom">Numb. xxiv. 1.</note> From the uſe of inchantments adopted by the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians in Egypt, it may be fairly concluded that what they did, was performed by the exertion of their art; and that therefore they wrought no miracle.</p>
               <p n="8">8thly. WHEN the magicians failed in their attempt to bring forth lice with their inchantments, they ſaid unto Pharaoh <hi>This is the ſinger of God;</hi> which confeſſion implies that what they had done before was effected by art. It is to be obſerved that the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:031762_0115_0FEE3EE0CE1F3818"/>do not ſay, "This is the finger of <hi>the Lord,</hi> or <hi>Jehovah,</hi>" in whoſe name Moſes did his miracles; but that, "This is the fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of <hi>God.</hi>" The word tranſlated <hi>God,</hi> in this paſſage, is applicable to any Deity; as we find from the uſe of it in the ſcriptures. It may therefore be inferred, that the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians themſelves acknowledged that there was no ſpecial interpoſition of <hi>Deity</hi> in all which they had done.</p>
               <p>IF the foregoing arguments are well foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, it muſt appear unneceſſary that the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred hiſtorian ſhould have ſaid in a formal manner, that the magicians in Egypt wrought no real miracle; ſince the ſame idea is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by the words which narrate their operations—<hi>"They did ſo with their inchant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments."</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE magicians, and kindred orders of men, might do many ſtrange and marvellous things in the days of Moſes, and they may now; but we ſeem not to have any evidence that God hath ever wrought a miracle by their hands. When Baal's prophets in the time of Elijah made an effort to call down ſire from heaven upon their altar, they were not able to accompliſh their wiſhes. When the exorciſts, mentioned in Acts xix. un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertook to caſt out evil ſpirits by invoking
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:031762_0116_0FEE3EE26802A918"/>the name of Jeſus, in connexion with their art, they were dreadfully confounded: ver. 15, 16. "And the evil ſpirit anſwered and ſaid, Jeſus I know, and Paul I know; but who are ye? And the man in whom the evil ſpirit was, leaped on them, and overcame them, and prevailed againſt them, ſo that they fled out of that houſe naked and wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed." Antichriſt claims the power of work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing miracles, but thoſe he exhibits, are ſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, in ſcripture, <hi>lying wonders;</hi> not only becauſe they are deſigned to eſtabliſh hereſy, but becauſe the facts to which he appeals are not of the miraculous kind: as will fully appear to any one who peruſes the legends of the Romiſh church, together with the writings of the reformers.</p>
               <p>HAVING attended to the caſe of the magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians, which is the moſt difficult of the kind recorded in the Bible, I need not pay particular attention to that which is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in 1 Samuel xxviii. relative to the reſurrection of the prophet by the witch of Endor. She is not to be conſidered as a worker of miracles, if ſome perſon, under the cover of the night was ſubſtituted by her to announce to Saul his deſtiny. This would be wholly the effect of art. Nor can ſhe be ranked among the performers of mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acles,
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:031762_0117_0FEE3EE3F89DE580"/>if, as is moſt probable, Jehovah inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed and raiſed Samuel, to deliver to the wicked king of Iſrael his doom. It is I think, obvious from the hiſtory, that while the witch was about to practiſe the art of divina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the prophet ſuddenly appeared. If this be admitted as fact, ſhe was in no ſenſe employed as an inſtrument in producing the miracle.</p>
               <p>THE laſt miraculous event in the old Teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament hiſtory which I ſhall conſider, is the one that was performed in the time of the prophet Elijah: Of this we have a particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar account in 1 Kings xviii. That prophet lived in the time when Ahab reigned over Iſrael; a prince who gave himſelf up with Jezebel his wife, to idolatry and wickedneſs, above all who had been raiſed to the throne before him. A drought of more than three years continuance was ſent upon the land, for the wickedneſs of the king and his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; and was followed by a dreadful famine. The prophet Elijah was commiſſioned by Jehovah to denounce to Ahab the withhold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the dew and the rain during that gloomy period. Near its cloſe he came out of his retirement by divine command, and went boldly to meet the king, who had been
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:031762_0118_0FEE2F8A19F46CA8"/>ſeeking to find the place where the prophet was ſheltered, that he might put him to death. "And it came to paſs, when Ahab ſaw Elijah, that Ahab ſaid unto him, art thou he that troubleth Iſrael? And he anſwered, I have not troubled Iſrael, but thou and thy father's houſe, in that ye have forſaken the commandments of the Lord, and thou haſt followed Baalim. Now, therefore, ſend, and gather to me all Iſrael unto mount Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel, and the prophets of Baal four hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red and fifty, and the prophets of the groves four hundred, which eat at Jezebel's table." Ahab aſſembled the people and the prophets according to deſire. "And Elijah came unto all the people, and ſaid, how long halt ye between two opinions, if the LORD be God, follow him: but if Baal, then follow him." The people manifeſted by their ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, that they had nothing to ſay againſt ſo reaſonable a propoſal. "Then ſaid Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah unto the people, I, even I only, remain a prophet of the Lord; but Baal's prophets are four hundred and fifty men. Let them, therefore, give us two bullocks; and let them chooſe one bullock for themſelves, and cut it in pieces, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under; and I will dreſs the other bullock, and lay it on wood, and put no fire under. And call ye on the name of your
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:031762_0119_0FEE3EE593F46600"/>gods, and I will call on the name of the LORD; and the god that anſwereth by fire, let him be God. And all the people an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered and ſaid it is well ſpoken." The prieſts of Baal took the bullock which they choſe, and prepared and laid it on their altar. They cried to their god from morning to evening, but there was neither voice, nor any to anſwer, nor any that regarded. Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jah proceeded to repair the altar of the LORD before all the people. He made a trench about it, and laid on the wood and the bullock in order. He commanded wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be poured upon the burnt-ſacrifice and the wood: This was done three times. "And the water ran about the altar; and he filled the trench alſo with water. And it came to paſs, at the time of the offering of the evening ſacrifice, that Elijah the prophet came near, and ſaid, LORD God of Abra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ham, Iſaac, and of Iſrael, let it be known this day that thou art God in Iſrael, and that I am thy ſervant, and that I have done all theſe things at thy word. Hear me, O Lord, hear me; that this people may know that thou art the Lord God, and that thou haſt turned their heart back again." The people muſt have waited with anxions deſire to ſee the iſſue—the controverſy decided, whether JEHOVAH or Baal be the true God.
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:031762_0120_0FEE3F70162D5670"/>The ſuſpenſe was immediately removed after the prayer of Elijah was cloſed. "The fire of the LORD fell, and conſumed the burnt-ſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifice, and the wood, and the ſtones, and the duſt, and licked up the water that was in the trench." The people felt the deciſion of the controverſy—They could not doubt for a moment. "They fell on their faces, and they ſaid, THE LORD, HE IS THE GOD! THE LORD, HE IS THE GOD!" In this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance we behold in a ſtriking manner, the proof which miracles afford that JEHOVAH is the only true God, and that mankind are under the higheſt obligations to worſhip and obey him, as required in his word.</p>
               <p>I PASS to the conſideration of ſome of the miracles recorded in the New Teſtament.</p>
               <p>THE number of miracles performed by Jeſus Chriſt was much greater than thoſe which were done by Moſes, or Elijah, or a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny who came before him. He went about all the cities and villages in the land of Iſrael, healing every ſickneſs and diſeaſe.<note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. ix.</note> "His fame went throughout all Syria; and they brought unto him all ſick people that were taken with divers diſeaſes, and torments, and thoſe which were poſſeſſed with devils, and thoſe which were lunatic, and thoſe that had
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:031762_0121_0FEE3EF19AB17348"/>the palſy; and he healed them."<note n="†" place="bottom">Matth. iv. 24.</note> He cured perſons, and that in an inſtant, who were deaf, and blind, and dumb, and lame. They immediately recovered their hearing, their ſight, their ſpeech, and the uſe of their limbs; and remained in a ſtate of recovery. He removed completely at once, infirmities which had been of many years ſtanding. This is altogether different from curing by the application of medicine; which is very ſlow in its progreſs in overcoming chronic diſorders. Chriſt reſtored ſoundneſs to the body, as well as regularity to the mind, by uttering a word. Many ſuch miracles as the foregoing were performed in a public manner, and before enemies. He fed four thouſand men, beſide women and children, with ſeven loaves of bread, and a few little fiſhes; and ſeven baſkets of fragments re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained. At another time he fed about five thouſand men with five loaves and two fiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es; and twelve baſkets of fragments remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. He ſilenced the tempeſt by his voice, and he walked on the waves of the ſea. He reſtored life to the dead. Three inſtances are particularly mentioned, viz. the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow's ſon at Nain, Jairus's daughter at Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernaum, and Lazarus at Bethany. Let us
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:031762_0122_0FEE308ACAD43780"/>beſtow our attention for a moment on theſe inſtances.</p>
               <p>WHEN Jeſus approached the gate of the city of Nain, with many of his diſciples and much people, he met a funeral proceſſion. A croud had collected to mourn with a ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rowful mother, in a ſtate of widowhood, whoſe only ſon had fallen a victim to death in the bloom of youth: the corpſe was now moving to the land of ſilence. The com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion of Jeſus was tenderly touched, as he beheld the flowing tears of a ſolitary widow, mourning for her only ſon. "He ſaid unto her, weep not. And he came and touched the bier; and they that bare him ſtood ſtill." The attention of the throng muſt have been fixed upon this ſtranger—Their eyes and their ears were open—What doth this traveller de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign! The multitude ſoon heard and ſaw with amazement—He ſpoke with an audible voice, <hi>Young man! I ſay unto thee, Ariſe!</hi> "And he that was dead ſat up, and began to ſpeak. And he delivered him to his moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er." The ſpectators felt a ſolemn awe; "and they glorified God, ſaying, that a great prophet is riſen up among us; and, that God hath viſited his people."<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke vii.</note>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="127" facs="unknown:031762_0123_0FEE3EF336FB35E8"/>
JAIRUS, a ruler of the ſynagogue, had one only daughter, about twelve years of age, who lay a dying. He came to Jeſus, who was then ſurrounded by a multitude, and fell at his feet, and with all the diſtreſs and anguiſh which a father feels, when his child appears to be in the agonies of death, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſought him to go to his houſe to ſtay the departing ſpirit. As the great phyſician did not repair to the place ſo ſoon as requeſted, word was ſoon brought him that the maiden was dead, and that he needed not make the viſit lately requeſted. But when Jeſus heard it, he told the meſſenger, that ſhe ſhould be made whole. He went to the melancholy houſe, and found the family weeping and bewailing their dead friend. "He took her by the hand, and called, ſaying, <hi>Maid! a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe!</hi> And her ſpirit came again, and ſhe aroſe ſtraightway."<note n="*" place="bottom">Luke viii.</note>
               </p>
               <p>LAZARUS of Bethany, was raiſed from the dead after he had lain in the grave four days. This miracle was wrought in preſence of a great number of ſpectators.

               <p>THE reſurrection of Jeſus Chriſt, is a mir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acle, which taken in all its circumſtances, is the moſt remarkable of any that was ever wrought in our world, and furniſhes the higheſt evidence of his divine miſſion, and that the goſpel is from God. Jeſus ſhowed unto his diſciples while he was purſuing his public miniſtry, that he muſt go up to Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſalem, be delivered into the hands of men, ſuffer many things of the elders, and chief prieſts and ſcribes, and be killed, and be raiſed again the third day.<note n="†" place="bottom">Matth. xvi. 21. Mark ix. 31.</note>
               </p>
               <p>HAD not Jeſus Chriſt riſen from the dead, his religion muſt have early periſhed. Its fate would have been the ſame with that of the French prophets, a ſet of enthuſiaſts who
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:031762_0125_0FEE308C689A3DC8"/>appeared in England about a hundred years ago. When one of their chiefs lay on his death-bed, and was actually expiring, he told his followers round him that he ſhould riſe on a certain day and hour; and that if he failed, they muſt conclude that they had been deluded. The day came—a vaſt number of people aſſembled round the grave—as the hour approached, a noted partiſan lifted up his voice, and called to his deceaſed friend—Riſe! Oh riſe! or we are undone! But the clods continued to cover the dead body, and the deluſion was detected in the eyes of the world. If Chriſt had not riſen, as he predicted, his cauſe would have ſunk. Saith the Apoſtle Paul in 1 Cor. xv. <hi>If Chriſt be not riſen, then is our preaching vain, and your faith is alſo vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE death of Jeſus was not in private a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his friends, but in public among his enemies; by whom he was executed as a malefactor. When he was taken down from the croſs, his enemies were fully ſatisfied that he was dead. Life could not have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained in him after the Roman ſoldier had thruſt the ſpear into his ſide. His body was lodged in a ſepulchre hewn out of a rock, a ſtone was rolled unto its door. By Pilate's order a ſeal was put upon the ſtone, and a
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:031762_0126_0FEE3EF6AB9A1C00"/>guard of ſoldiers was placed by it. On the third day, <hi>Behold, there was a great earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake: for the angel of the Lord deſcended from heaven, and came and rolled back the ſtone from the door, and ſat upon it. His countenance was like lightening, and his raiment white as ſnow. And for fear of him the keepers did ſhake, and became as dead men.</hi> The angel ſaid to the women who came unto the ſepul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chre, Jeſus who was crucified is not here; <hi>for he is riſen, as he ſaid. Come, ſee the place where the Lord lay.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Matth. xxviii.</note>
               </p>
               <p>THE women who viſited the ſepulchre in the morning after Chriſt aroſe, did not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect in their ſetting out to find him alive, for their deſign was to anoint the dead body with the ſpices they had prepared. None of the diſciples of Chriſt expected his reſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection. They never could underſtand du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring his life how his dying, and to be ſure in ſuch ignominy, was reconcileable with his Meſſiahſhip. They were ſlow to believe in the reſurrection of Chriſt, after the event had taken place. The force of evidence a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone gained their faith. The appearances of Chriſt to them were continued at different times and places, when few and many were together, during the courſe of forty days.
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:031762_0127_0FEE30F9DE467D00"/>He was ſeen of above 500 brethren at once; of whom the greater part remained alive when Paul wrote his firſt epiſtle to the church of Corinth; many years after the aſcenſion.</p>
               <p>THE ſtory of the watch placed at Chriſt's ſepulchre, <hi>That his diſciples came and ſtole him away while they ſlept,</hi> is full of abſurdities. They were hired to tell it by a large ſum of money given them by the chief prieſts and elders of the Jews. Do men need bribing to tell the truth? Does not the deſign of a bribe always carry in it a wiſh to conceal facts? Beſides, as it is well known that thoſe who ſlept on guard, were if detected, pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed by the Roman laws with death, the ſoldiers would not have dared to confeſs themſelves aſleep when on duty, had not the Jewiſh rulers agreed to pacify Pilate on their behalf. Had there been the leaſt pretext for the ſtory the ſoldiers told, the chief prieſts would have been the firſt men in Judea to bring the watch to puniſhment; as that would have given credibility to the account which they ſtrove to propagate. Every thing relative to the conduct of the chief prieſts in this affair, carries fraud in the face of it, and confirms the truth of Chriſt's reſurrection. Moreover, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony given by the watch relative to a fact,
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:031762_0128_0FEE2F7B145D1AB0"/>which, by their own confeſſion, took place while they were aſleep, is of ſuch a nature, as is wholly inadmiſſible before a court of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, or by the dictates of common ſenſe. Are men to be credited in affirming a fact, which they declare to have happened at a time when they could have no conſciouſneſs of it? Is there an honeſt man of common underſtanding upon the globe, who would venture to decide in any thing of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence on ſuch teſtimony?</p>
               <p>IT has been objected to the truth of Chriſt's reſurrection that he did not ſhow himſelf after his death to his judges, and his enemies in general. To obviate this diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty, it may be obſerved, that if Chriſt af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter he left the ſepulchre had gone into their preſence, they probably would, from the malice and blindneſs they had diſcovered, have conſidered the appearance as an idle dream; and have remained as obſtinate as they were after the reſurrection of Lazarus. But let us ſuppoſe that by ſuch an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance they had all been gained over to the belief of the fact, and had become Chriſt's diſciples, would not the enemies of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel have ſaid, that ſince all the great men in the nation had received it, the whole was a contrived plan, and therefore ought to be given up as a cunningly deviſed fable?
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:031762_0129_0FEE3EA583A60178"/>This objection would have carried much more plauſibility in it than any that can now be urged. Chriſtianity did not riſe up un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the patronage of the powerful and the great. It was left to work its way in the world by its internal evidence, and the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious aids of its founder. Several perſons of learning and note were converted to it in its infancy; among theſe was Saul of Tarſus; but they became friends to the goſpel in a way that gives not the leaſt coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance to the ſuggeſtion, that it owed its birth to the wiſdom of this world. Chriſt crucified was to the Jews a ſtumbling block, and to the Greeks fooliſhneſs.</p>
               <p>WITHIN a ſhort time after Chriſt's reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urrection, his diſciples publicly and boldly proclaimed it in Jeruſalem, where he was put to death; and wrought miracles on the ground that he was alive. They went forth and preached this doctrine every where, the Lord working with them, and confirming the word with ſigns following.</p>
               <p>TO CONCLUDE, we have deciſive evidence from the miracles of Moſes and the Proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ets, and from thoſe of Jeſus Chriſt, and his Apoſtles, that all ſcripture is given by inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of God.</p>

               <p>IN the two laſt diſcourſes, arguments were introduced to prove the divine inſpira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſcriptures, from the nature of the religion they contain, and the miracles re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded in them. I now proceed to a <hi>third</hi> argument, derived from the fulfilment of their prophecies.</p>
               <p>BY prophecy is meant, the foretelling of events that are not within the reach of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man probability, and of which no knowledge
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:031762_0131_0FEE3F01E2E8B0F8"/>can be obtained beforehand but from God. To look into futurity and diſcern ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents, with the time and circumſtances of their coming into exiſtence, is peculiar to the infinite mind. Iſaiah xlvi. 9, 10. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member the former things of old: for I am God, and there is none elſe; I am God, and there is none like me; declaring the end from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, and from ancient times the things that are not yet done, ſaying, My counſel ſhall ſtand, and I will do all my pleaſure.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THAT the ſcriptures abound with proph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecies, will be denied by none who have read them. The prophecies are ſo interwoven with the ſacred writings, as not to be ſepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated. If the predictions were not delivered before the events which they hold up as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, had happened, we muſt give up the Bible, and conſider it as a forgery. But if the prophets were let into the ſecrets of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turity, as we have abundant evidence from the fulfilment of their predictions, they were immediately enlightened from on high, and the ſcriptures are demonſtrated to be the word of the Lord. It has been often pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved that the prophecies reſpecting the cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity of the Jews in Babylon, the coming of Jeſus of Nazareth, the deſtruction of Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem by the Romans, and many others,
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:031762_0132_0FEE3F0382FD1360"/>were deliverd prior to the events which an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to them. The argument in favor of the divine original of the Bible from prophecy, carries irreſiſtible force, when we reflect on the conduct of providence in fulfilling pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions at the preſent time, which all will grant were written and publiſhed many ages ago. To two prophecies of this kind, I now call your attention.</p>
               <p>I SHALL begin with the prophecy con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning Iſhmael, Abraham's ſon by Hagar, recorded in Gen. xvi. As that woman was wandering in the wilderneſs,
<q>The angel of the Lord ſaid unto her, I will multiply thy ſeed exceedingly, that it ſhall not be numbered for multitude.—Behold, thou art with child, and ſhalt bear a ſon, and ſhalt call his name Iſhmael; becauſe the Lord hath heard thy affliction. And he will be a wild man; his hand will be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt every man, and every man's hand againſt him: and he ſhall dwell in the preſence of all his brethren.</q> This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction principally relates to Iſhmael's poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity; but a ſmall part of it, beſide his birth, could have any accompliſhment in his perſon. A numerous ſeed deſcended from him, which remain to this day. It is ſaid of
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:031762_0133_0FEE3F1037966090"/>his deſcendants, in Gen. xxv. 18. That "they dwelt from Havilah unto Shur, that is before Egypt, as thou goeſt towards Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſyria." The place here aſſigned to them is the ſame with what was afterwards in ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture called <hi>Arabia,</hi> and continues to have the ſame name, and to be poſſeſſed by the ſame people, to the preſent time. The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rabians have never been conquered either by the Aſſyrians, Perſians, Greeks, Romans, Tartars, or any other nation. They have always been a peſt to mankind, and have practiſed robberies upon them. Their hand has been againſt every man, and of courſe, every man's hand has been againſt them, but none have been able to conquer them. They have lived in the midſt of all their brethren. In the earlier periods of their hiſtory, the deſcendants of Abraham by Ke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turah, and the poſterity of Iſaac bordered upon them. To whatever power theſe neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, or others, roſe, they retained their dominion; and were not driven from any part of their territories.
<q>They have from firſt to laſt maintained their independency, and notwithſtanding the moſt powerful efforts for their deſtruction, ſtill dwell in the preſence of all their brethren, and in the preſence of all their enemies.<note n="*" place="bottom">Newton on the Prophecies, in two Volumes, 9th E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, p. 25, 26.

WHO but the omniſcient God could have foreſeen the ſtate of the deſcendants of Iſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mael? Is not the fulfilment of the predic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning them a ſtriking proof in ſupport of the divine original of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures?</p>
               <p>THE prophecies reſpecting the ſtate of the Jews, which have been fulfilled in the latter ages, and are now fulfilling, are too remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to be paſſed by in ſilence, when attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the preſent ſubject. The diſperſion and the wretchedneſs of that people were foretold by Moſes. The curſes which ſhould fall upon them for their diſobedience, are particularly and largely denounced in Deut. xxviii. I ſhall ſelect a few paſſages only; ver. 37. <hi>And thou ſhalt become an aſtoniſhment, a proverb, and a by-word, among all nations whither the Lord thy God ſhall lead thee.</hi> Verſes 64, 65, 66. <hi>And the Lord ſhall ſcatter thee among all people, from the one end of the earth unto the other; and there thou ſhalt ſerve other gods, which neither thou nor thy fathers have known, even wood and ſtone. And among theſe nations ſhalt thou find no eaſe, neither ſhall the ſole of thy foot have reſt; but the Lord will give thee there a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and ſorrow of mind: And thy life ſhall hang in doubt before thee; and thou ſhalt fear day
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:031762_0135_0FEE3F11D913B168"/>and night, and ſhalt have none aſſurance of thy life.</hi> Theſe predictions were in a degree ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by the captivity of the kingdoms of Iſrael and Judah, by the Aſſyrians and Chal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deans; but have received a fuller accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment in the deſtruction of Jeruſalem by the Romans, and in the preſent diſperſion of the Jews. Theſe laſt events were fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told by Jeſus Chriſt, in Luke xxi. 24. <hi>And they ſhall fall by the edge of the ſword, and ſhall be led away captive into all nations: and Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem ſhall be trodden down of the Gentiles, until the times of the Gentiles be fulfilled.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>THE Jews were ſlaughtered in immenſe numbers, when their city was taken by Ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus the Roman general. A vaſt multitude has periſhed ſince, by maſſacres and perſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cutions. The Jews have not been permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to poſſeſs the land of Canaan or Paleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, for more than 1700 years; and they are ſcattered through Aſia, and through moſt of the countries of Europe and Africa; they are found on the American continent, and its adjacent iſlands. Their land has paſſed from one ſet of conquerors to anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, and is now in the hands of the Turks; and remains in a low and wretched ſtate. The Jews ſince their laſt diſperſion have, for the moſt part, found no reſt; but the
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:031762_0136_0FEE3F1397112E90"/>Lord has given them <hi>a trembling heart, and failing of eyes, and ſorrow of mind.</hi> They have not enjoyed the rights of other citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens in the places where they have lived, they have been baniſhed from many king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms; and in not a few inſtances, govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has laid its hand on the property of that unhappy people, in a way of fine and confiſcation. They have been deteſted by the nations, and have been <hi>a by-word</hi> among them. However criminal the Jews may have been, the benevolent heart is pained by even a ſummary recital of their ſufferings, and is rejoiced at the milder treatment they have met with of late. We hope that the period is at hand when their calamities will ceaſe, by the univerſally opening a door for their enjoyment of freedom, as is done by the ſpirit of the civil conſtitution of the U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States of America; and above all by their union with the Gentiles throughout the world under the Meſſiah.</p>
               <p>IT is remarkable that the Jews, tho' they have met with ſuch hardſhips and cruelties, yet remain a diſtinct people. This is the Lord's doing; and verifies what was ſpoken long ago by the prophets. I ſhall only mention in this place a paſſage recorded in Jerem. xxx. 11. addreſſed to Iſrael, <hi>For I
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:031762_0137_0FEE30E47915A1D8"/>am with thee, ſaith the Lord, to ſave thee: though I make a full end of all nations whither I have ſcattered thee, yet will I not make a full end of thee; but I will correct thee in meaſure, and will not leave thee altogether unpuniſhed.</hi> The Jews have not, like other nations, been ſwallowed up and loſt in conqueſts, by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termingling with their conquerors, or with thoſe among whom they have lived. Tho' they have had the ſtrongeſt inducements to intermarry, and to blend in all reſpects, with the Gentiles, they, as a body, remain as widely ſeparated from them by blood and religion as ever. However, they have, in ſome inſtances, externally complied with the idolatrous rites of the Romiſh church, to avoid the cruelties of the court of inquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they have at the ſame time adhered to the faith of their anceſtors; and when they have eſcaped from the danger of the rack, they have renounced chriſtianity in every form, and openly returned to their religion. They remain to this day a ſtriking proof that the author of the prophecies reſpecting them is divine; and conſequently that the ſcriptures are given by inſpiration of God.</p>
               <p>WOULD our limits permit, we might point to the fulfilment of many prophecies, which were delivered long before the events
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:031762_0138_0FEE3F15334267F0"/>they predict were brought into exiſtence. Babylon now lies in ruins, "a poſſeſſion for the bittern, and pools of water." Tyre, once "a mart of nations," is made "like the top of a rock; a place for the ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of nets in the midſt of the ſea." We behold the man of ſin, whoſe riſe was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicted in the prophecies of the Old and New Teſtament, "ſitting in the temple of God, ſhewing himſelf that he is God; whoſe coming is after the working of Satan, with all power, and ſigns, and lying won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders." And, to name no more, we behold now fulfilling the prophecy recorded in Rev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elation xvii. 16. "And the ten horns which thou ſaweſt upon the beaſt, theſe ſhall hate the whore, and ſhall make her deſolate, and naked, and ſhall eat her fleſh, and burn her with fire." The European kingdom which lead the way in giving temporal do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion to the beaſt revived under the anti-chriſtian tyranny, is now ſeizing on the wealth and deſtroying the influence which ſhe once gloried in giving to the Roman Pontiff. We are furniſhed with abundant proof, that the pens of the prophets were guided by Him who, from eternity, beholds all the events of time. The nearer we ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach to the end of the world, the evidence in ſupport of the inſpiration of the Bible
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:031762_0139_0FEE2F656609ABC0"/>from the fulfilment of the prophecies, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes more and more clear and convincing. Whatever abuſes are made of the increaſing light by the wicked, "the wiſe ſhall under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand."</p>
               <p>MY deſigned brevity on the copious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of theſe diſcourſes, forbids me to add to the foregoing arguments. I ſhall, after no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticing a few popular objections, conclude with a practical improvement.</p>
               <p>SOME have attempted to countenance their diſlike of the ſcriptures, by ſaying, that the language adopted in ſome parts of thoſe wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings, particularly in certain paſſages in the Old Teſtament, puts modeſty to the bluſh.</p>
               <p>Perſons of much information will not be perplexed with this difficulty. It will at once occur to them, that when God ſpeaks to any part of the human race, he muſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs them in a language which they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand, or the deſign of revelation will be loſt. It muſt follow of courſe, that the language of the age and the place when and where the revelation is made, muſt be adopted. The meaning of particular words is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly altering by uſage. The word <hi>knave,</hi> for inſtance, in our language, was hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore underſtood to mean a <hi>diligent ſervant;</hi>
                  <pb n="145" facs="unknown:031762_0140_0FEE30D92634DE58"/>but cuſtom now appropriates it to one who is guilty of <hi>fraud</hi> in his dealings with man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. Cuſtom is as much the ſtandard of decency in the clothing of our thoughts, as in the clothing of our bodies. Some of the words and phraſes in our tranſlation of the Bible, which may appear indelicate when compared with modern ſtyle, did not offend againſt delicacy two hundred years ago; and they may not two hundred years hence, or in a much ſhorter term. Among a civi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lized people it is as eaſy to diſcern a rotation in words and phraſes, as in any thing elſe that is equally under human control. It would be very ſtrange indeed, if the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal language of the pentateuch, which was committed to writing more than three thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand years ago, perfectly ſuited the various taſtes which have prevailed in ſtyle, from the days ot Moſes to our time. It is to be remarked that the books which he wrote have paſſed through very different ſtates of ſociety, in the lapſe of ſo many ages; to each of which it is impoſſible that they ſhould be compleatly conformed: Yet the manner in which thoſe books were written will abide the teſt of ſound criticiſm at the preſent era of high literary improvement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="146" facs="unknown:031762_0141_0FEE30E9506FA440"/>
LET us admit, for a moment, that the whole phraſeology and manner of writing in the moſt ancient parts of the Jewiſh ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, perfectly correſponded with modern taſte—I ſay, let us make this ſuppoſition, in order to learn whether that part of the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble which is accuſed of indelicacy, would be as defenſible as it now is. We may diſcern at once the effect of the ſuppoſed change. The men who cavil now, would immediately tack about, and exclaim againſt the penta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teuch as a forgery, from its ſtyle. Hence, we ſee that the antiquity of the ſtyle uſed in the Moſaic writings, as well as in other parts of ſcripture, is a matter of importance in the controverſy with infidels. It was as proper that the ſacred penmen ſhould adopt the language and manner of writing pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar to their own times, as that in alluding to mountains in their diſcourſes to the Jews, they ſhould name <hi>Horeb, Carmel, or Hermon,</hi> rather than the <hi>Allegany,</hi> or the <hi>Andes.</hi> Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter what has been ſaid on the change of the meaning of words and the ſtate of ſociety, it is evident that no one has any juſt cauſe to impeach the language of the ſcriptures of offences againſt modeſty.</p>
               <p>THE diſputes about what the religion of the Bible is, among thoſe who profeſs to
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:031762_0142_0FEE30DED38B5F48"/>adopt it, have been urged by ſome as an objection againſt its divine original. To this it may be anſwered,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. THAT the enemies of divine revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion are not agreed among themſelves. Some infidels profeſs to believe that God is a good being; others deny that any ſuch concluſion can be formed. Some of them conſider the ſoul of man as immortal; whilſt others ſuppoſe that it dies with the body. If the diſputes among chriſtians overthrow chriſtianity, the diſputes among deiſts overthrow deiſm. The objection weighs nothing on either ſide, and is wholly impertinent.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. A CONSIDERABLE number of the controverſies among chriſtians do not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect the eſſentials of their religion; but are to be accounted for from the manner in which they are educated, the religious treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſes they read, the perſons with whom they aſſociate in the early periods of ſerious thoughtfulneſs, and ſimilar cauſes. Differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences of this kind do not prove that the Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble inculcates oppoſite principles; for it is admitted that they do not materially affect what is neceſſary to fit men for everlaſting happineſs.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="148" facs="unknown:031762_0143_0FEE3F1ED87DFD30"/>
3dly. IT is granted that opinions have been maintained by ſome who profeſs to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the inſpiration of the ſcriptures, which ſtrike at their fundamental truths. But the riſe of damnable hereſies is ſo far from overthrowing the Bible, that it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it; for that book contains many pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dictions that ſuch errors will appear; eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially in the laſt days.</p>
               <p>VIOLENT prejudices have been conceived againſt the religion of Jeſus Chriſt, from the bad things which have been done under the cloak of it. To remove this ſtumbling block, let it be obſerved,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. THAT if the bad things which have been done by thoſe who call themſelves chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, go to the ſubverſion of the goſpel, deiſm muſt be overthrown according to the ſame plan of reaſoning. I preſume that no one who is the moſt warmly engaged in ſupport of infidelity, will affirm that all deiſts have ſhown high reverence to the Deity in their behaviour, or that they have all been men of ſobriety, juſtice, mercy and truth. We have to acknowledge with grief, that many abominable things have been done by per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons who have called themſelves the diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of Jeſus Chriſt; but if we muſt give up our religion on account of their conduct,
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:031762_0144_0FEE3F206F2AD828"/>the deiſts muſt give up theirs on account of the impious and debauched morals of ſome of their order.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. THERE is nothing in the nature of revealed religion which tends to the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of morals; but every thing in it tends to make bad men better. The moral law requires holineſs, and forbids every ſin. The goſpel breathes the ſame ſpirit. It prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſes pardon and happineſs only to the pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itent, and encourages with the hope of a crown of righteouſneſs, patient continuance in well doing. The puniſhments threaten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the wicked are ſuited to alarm them, and to deter from the practice of iniquity. The religion of Jeſus Chriſt has actually had the happieſt influence on thoſe who have cordially embraced it; as has appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their lives and deaths.</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. WICKED men would not cloak their wickedneſs under the garb of the chriſtian profeſſion, unleſs there were ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the goſpel which recommends it to the conſciences of mankind. There could be no counterfeit coin, if there were no real coin. Men do not counterfeit iron or lead; but ſilver and gold, or ſomething that rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſents the value of theſe precious metals. Thoſe perſons who commit iniquity under
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:031762_0145_0FEE3F2203008248"/>the maſk of friendſhip to the goſpel, are ſo far from proving it to be of no worth, that even they themſelves by implication, teſtify in its favor, though it is againſt their luſts.</p>
               <p n="4">4thly. WE ought not to conclude againſt the worth of the chriſtian religion from its abuſes, on account of the abſurdities which ſuch an inference will draw after it. We muſt, to be conſiſtent with ſuch a concluſion, pronounce all the bleſſings of common providence to be evils in themſelves; for they all have been, and ſtill are, ſhamefully abuſed. If we pronounce every thing bad, and to be avoided, which has been employed for a bad purpoſe, we muſt conſider as evil, food and raiment, the ground on which we tread, the ſtreams that water it, the produce of the garden and the field, the light which ſtrikes our eyes, and the air we breathe. We need not wonder that perſons who diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute againſt the goodneſs of God, from the pains they bring upon themſelves by abuſing it, wiſh to take refuge in annihilation, and indulge the forlorn hope that by ſuicide they ſhall haſten their return to the womb of nothing.</p>
               <p n="5">5thly. IT will be acknowledged by every candid obſerver, that the religion of the goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel promotes ſocial happineſs in every circle
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:031762_0146_0FEE3F2DEFB17CE8"/>in which it reigns. It prevents the wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs which flows from riot and debauche<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, ſuppreſſes the malignant paſſions, and diffuſes the calm and pure pleaſures of tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perance, diligence, contentment, and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip. Whatever perſecutions have been en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dured for righteouſneſs' ſake, it is too plain to be denied, that the practice of chriſtianity gives a happineſs to individuals and to col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lective bodies, to which thoſe are ſtrangers who treat it with contempt. It has more<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>over been abundantly demonſtrated by able writers, that where it is externally regarded by the inhabitants of a country in general, their morals are not ſo looſe as are thoſe of nations devoted to pagan idolatry.</p>
               <p>IT is hoped that the obſervations which have been made, will be thought ſufficient to wipe away the reproach which has been caſt upon the chriſtian religion, from the bad things that have been done by its hypocritical profeſſors.</p>
               <p>THOSE who reject the divine authority of the Bible, have endeavoured to juſtify their unbelief, by pleading, that they cannot be under obligations to conform their faith and practice to a book, which contains myſteries above the comprehenſion of the human mind.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="152" facs="unknown:031762_0147_0FEE3F2F88694260"/>
IF the objections of this kind are juſt, it will follow that we are not bound to believe any thing which we cannot comprehend. But is there a man on the earth, "in his right mind," who will avow this conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence? We are unable to comprehend the works of nature with which we are ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded. We know not how water is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gealed into the hardneſs of ſtone; nor can we comprehend the growth of even a ſingle blade of graſs. Man is a myſtery to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. He cannot tell why certain kinds of food nouriſh his body rather than others; nor how his limbs are put in motion by the volitions of his ſoul. If we are not bound to give our aſſent to any thing which we cannot underſtand in all its parts, we muſt deny facts which are daily taking place be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our eyes, yea more, we muſt deny our own exiſtence. The objection we are now conſidering will go to atheiſm; for no creature can fathom abſolute eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. If there be a God he never had a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning. When the human mind contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plates this ſubject it is ſwallowed up and loſt. "Canſt thou by ſearching find out God? Canſt thou find out the Almighty unto perfection?"</p>
               <p>IN the ſupernatural revelation God hath
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:031762_0148_0FEE3F312EFDA9C0"/>made of his will, he ſpeaks like himſelf—a Being infinitely great. Were all the myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries which are delivered in the ſacred vol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ume, perfectly on a level with our limited minds lately called into exiſtence, the gov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ernment of the moral world would be pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in a lower grade than the kingdom of nature, and we ſhould not have the ſame evidence as we now have that the finger of God is imprinted on the ſcriptures. But tho' ſome of the doctrines of the Bible are ſo high that we can know but little concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in this dark probationary ſtate, they can be ſufficiently apprehended even by babes in underſtanding to obtain eternal life. Beſides, the truths which are moſt myſterious are ſo interwoven with thoſe which are plain, that if we reject the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, we muſt reject the latter. The various parts of this remarkable book form one har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monious ſyſtem of faith and practice.</p>
               <p>THE laſt objection that I ſhall notice is taken from the ſmall extent within which the writings of the Old and New Teſtament have been known. Since the ſcriptures ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit an excluſive claim of guiding the human race in the way of truth and happineſs, it is contended, that their partial ſpread is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with the character of Him who is
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:031762_0149_0FEE3F3AA6174050"/>the Father of all mankind, and is no reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecter of perſons; and that therefore they cannot be given by inſpiration of God. To obviate this objection, let the following things be conſidered,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. GOD in his common providence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes his gifts, both of body and mind, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry variouſly; as daily experience teaches. It will not be pretended that men have juſt cauſe to complain of him, becauſe he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtows upon ſome a more vigorous animal frame, or a higher degree of intellect, than upon others. No reaſon can be aſſigned, why the means of moral and religious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement may not be as greatly diverſified, by the ſovereign of the univerſe, as other bleſſings are. Beſides, the obligation deri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from privileges, is proportioned to their nature and degree. Mankind are not pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed for diſregarding truths of which they could have no knowledge; but for reſiſting the light that has ſhone before them.</p>
               <p n="2">2dly. SINCE the whole human race have forfeited every favor from the hand of God, by ſin, he may juſtly exclude them all from happineſs, and conſequently may deny them opportunity of becoming acquainted with thoſe writings which contain the words of eternal life. All the favors enjoyed by
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:031762_0150_0FEE3F3C48333288"/>apoſtate creatures, flow from divine ſove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign mercy; which excludes every idea of claim on their part. Thoſe, therefore, who are left in heatheniſh darkneſs, experience no injuſtice. Their demerit is not leſſened, nor is their ſtate rendered any more deplor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, by reaſon of God's conduct in giving the ſcriptures to others. If any refuſe to receive them becauſe they are not known throughout the world, they diſcover great ingratitude, and perverſeneſs. God has conferred upon us, the inhabitants of the United States of America, a larger portion of freedom than is poſſeſſed by moſt nations. Shall we murmur, and throw away our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, becauſe providence has not cauſed all our fellow-men to enjoy the ſame bleſſings? Who hath licenſed a worm of the duſt to dictate to the ſovereign Ruler of heaven and earth! Or to ſay unto him, "What doeſt thou!"</p>
               <p n="3">3dly. IT is owing to the criminal indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference of mankind to the ſcriptures, that the knowledge of them is confined within ſuch narrow limits. Had, for inſtance, the ſeveral families of the ſons of Noah, in their diſperſions from the plain in the land of Shinar, been friends to the truths which had at that time been revealed, they would
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:031762_0151_0FEE3F3DDE9B3868"/>have faithfully preſerved them, and made high exertions to tranſmit them to their poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity. Had the word of the Lord been ſweet unto their taſte, they would have been much more deſirous of handing it down to their ſucceſſors, than they were their knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge of the arts. A like pious zeal paſſing from one generation to another, would have prevented the ignorance of divine reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation which ſoon prevailed. By the time of Abraham there was a general departure to idolatry. That renowned patriarch ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed in many places, after he left Ur of the Chaldees in obedience to the command of God; for the ſetting up his worſhip in a pure form. But the people among whom he reſided, in Canaan, in Egypt, and in other countries, did not improve the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of learning from him the truths and laws which he had immediately communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated to him from God, or had been tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted to him through the preceding inſpir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men. The Egyptians paid no laſting at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to the mighty works wrought among them by the arm of Jehovah, in the days of Moſes; nor did they regard the means of inſtruction in the knowledge of the revealed will of God, to which they might have had acceſs. When the Iſraelites were ſettled in Canaan, they were placed in the central ſpot
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:031762_0152_0FEE3F3F9819A5B0"/>of the then known world. On different ſide: of them lay Egypt, Arabia, Syria, Chaldea, and Aſſyria; out of which nations aroſe the firſt empires of note among mankind. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der thoſe monarchies the arts and ſciences were firſt cultivated, and from them have been ſpread among the inhabitants of the weſtern regions. The land given to the children of Iſrael is waſhed on one ſide by the Mediterranean ſea, and bordered on the once famous cities of Tyre and Sidon; which extended their commerce to diſtant countries. To the nations of the eaſt the choſen people were well known, whilſt they dwelt in Canaan. By their captivity under the Aſſyrians and Chaldeans, the ſacred books were carried into many parts of Aſia; where they were kept by the diſperſed Jews until the day when the Meſſiah appeared. In the ages which followed the return of ſome of the captives to Jeruſalem under Cyrus, and the rebuilding of their city and temple, the Jews became well known to the Greeks and the Romans. The Apoſtles in their time carried the goſpel far beyond the bounds of Judea, and preached the word of eternal life among the Gentiles.</p>
               <p>IF there had been a general love of divine truth among the human race, the ſcriptures
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:031762_0153_0FEE3F4BE8135A88"/>would have been diſſeminated far and wide on this inhabited globe. From the inatten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the inſpired writings which has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the conduct of mankind, it is man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ifeſt that they have not choſen to retain God in their knowledge. Inſtead of charging him with an unjuſt partiality, let them con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs that ſin is the cauſe of the extenſive reign of heathen darkneſs. It is wholly ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the mere ſovereign mercy of God, that the knowledge of divine revelation has not periſhed from the earth.</p>
               <p>HAVING taken a brief view of ſome of the principal arguments in ſupport of the truth and inſpiration of the Bible, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to obviate ſeveral objections, I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to improve the ſubject.</p>
               <p n="1">1. WE may reflect on the unreaſonable and dangerous conduct of thoſe who are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoring to undermine, and deſtroy the influence of revealed religion; by repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it as the work of viſionary or intereſted men. Many of the deiſts have never given themſelves the trouble of examining into the evidences of the truth and inſpiration of the ſcriptures; but having picked up here and there ſomething which they diſlike in them, either by deſultory reading, or from pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſcuous company, they proceed to aſſert
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:031762_0154_0FEE3F4D820578A8"/>with great confidence, that thoſe writings are the work of a mercenary prieſthood, or deſigning politicians. Such treatment of a book which claims a divine origin, not only announces the badneſs of their hearts who thus haſtily reject it, but does no honor to their underſtandings. Among the few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidels who have gone into elaborate diſquiſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concerning the authority of the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, methods have been adopted, by men of genius and ſcience, to overthrow thoſe writings, which carry in them the groſſeſt abſurdities. If the ſame kind of reaſoning were employed on any other ſubject, they themſelves would look upon it with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. For the ſake of evading the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence from miracles, deiſts have labored to eſtabliſh ſuch rules, for determining the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtence of facts of which we have not been perſonal witneſſes, as would deſtroy our faith in all hiſtory. They have fallen into errors of the moſt palpable kind, in their attempts to prove that the Bible is at vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with itſelf. As, for inſtance, when the different writers of any part of its hiſtory, do not ſay preciſely the ſame thing, or one of them mentions facts omitted by another, infidels reject the whole as the contradictory accounts of lying impoſters. At the ſame time they will give full credit to many au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:031762_0155_0FEE3F4F2616EE48"/>of civil hiſtory, who, in narrating the ſame general events, mention different cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances from each other, and will ſpeak of ſuch hiſtorians with applauſe. Deiſts will grant that God may deſtroy countries by the peſtilence, famine, or earthquakes; but if he employ men as the inſtruments of his wrath, as he did in cutting off the inhab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itants of Canaan, they cry out, <hi>cruelty! hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid</hi> cruelty! They overlook the proof of the inſpiration of the ſcriptures, which is fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed by miracles of the moſt ſtriking kind. They ſhut their eyes againſt the light that ſhines with meridian brightneſs, in the ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment of the prophecies. They withhold no exertions, in their power, to heap re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach upon that pure and benevolent reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, which correſponds with the divine character, opens a door of hope to the guilty, and conducts the humble and the penitent to a world of everlaſting joy. The open enemies of the goſpel, ſtrive to bring in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to univerſal contempt the only religion that can reconcile mankind to God, and unite them in permanent love to one another. Infidels themſelves are very much indebted, for their ſpeculative knowledge of the Deity and moral virtue, to the Bible. By rejec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it they diſcover their ingratitude, and ſhort ſightedneſs.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="161" facs="unknown:031762_0156_0FEE3F50CB5B2290"/>
WHAT advantages do deiſts expect to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from trampling under foot the holy ſcriptures? They have nothing to put in the place of the doctrines which they explode, that can yield them ſolid enjoyment in their gayeſt ſeaſons. What conſolation can their principles afford, when carried into practice, in days of trouble, or in the hour of ſerious reflection? Their philoſophy cannot allevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate their pains; by aſſuring them of a future ſtate, or by pointing out the road which leads to ſubſtantial interminable happineſs. But do they wiſh to rid themſelves of the belief of a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments? and hope to die like the brutes? Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſagacity! What! do the honor and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of man ſtand on a level with the hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or and happineſs of the beaſts of the field!</p>
               <p>WHAT benefit will ſociety derive from the ſpread of deiſtical principles? Have they ever when fully imbibed, reformed a ſingle vicious perſon? Experience demonſtrates that in proportion as they prevail among a people, they weaken reverence towards the name of God, and are accompanied with looſe morals. Such are the unhappy effects which infidelity produces: nor can they be denied on account of the regular lives of a
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:031762_0157_0FEE3F5E6D651418"/>few of its friends, who are immerſed in ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, or whoſe high official rank impels to pay a decent reſpect to the general opinion. Civil laws will be found feeble reſtraints on communities, when the reſtraints of reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed religion are deſtroyed.</p>
               <p>THOSE who make a direct attack on the ſacred volume are highly criminal. Noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing can juſtify them in acting againſt the light that is held up before them, in the word and works of God. None are required to believe the ſcriptures without ſufficient evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence to ſatisfy the rational mind; but ſince they are abundantly ſupported by the ſcheme of religion they contain, as well as by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal teſtimonies, none can deny their di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine original without incurring infinite guilt. The difficulties that have been ſtarted rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to their hiſtory, their faith and morals, may be removed to the ſatisfaction of the candid. It is impious in creatures to ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt that a better manifeſtation of truth might have been made than is exhibited in them. There is a depth in God's wiſdom and knowledge which we cannot fathom. He only knows how to diſplay his perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions before finite intelligencies in the beſt manner to glorify his holy name, and what are the moſt ſuitable means to bring ſinners
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:031762_0158_0FEE3F601358BA70"/>to repentance. A cavilling temper is never ſatisfied. If any will not hear Moſes and the Prophets, Chriſt, and the Apoſtles, neither would they be perſuaded tho' one roſe from the dead.</p>
               <p>WHAT confuſion would fill the mind of a deiſt, ſhould one of his converts addreſs him in the moment of remorſe, <q>You, Sir, firſt taught me to laugh at religion—then to doubt its truth—and then to trample it under foot. I followed you next into vice—I threw off reſtraint—I have not feared God, nor have I regarded man. I tremble to think of my end: For tho' I ſtill wiſh to diſbelieve, my conſcience whiſpers—<hi>what if the goſpel I have denied ſhould prove true at laſt!</hi>
                  </q> How, O ye ſons of infidelity! who boaſt of making diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples to your creed, and to every faſhiona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble vice—how can ye endure to meet the ſouls you have deluded and undone, at the bar of God! They will riſe as ſwift witneſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes againſt you before him who will judge the world in righteouſneſs. Be entreated to read the ſcriptures with a candid, ſerious temper, and impartially examine the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which eſtabliſh their truth and inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration. God grant that you may no longer
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:031762_0159_0FEE3F61A14A2010"/>remain enemies of the Goſpel; but that it may be rendered effectual to your ſalvation.</p>
               <p n="2">2. IN a review of the ſubject of theſe diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes, we are taught the duty of the friends of revealed religion, to labor for its defence, and to make it the guide of their lives.</p>
               <p>WE declare with our lips our belief in the truth and inſpiration of the ſcriptures of the Old and New Teſtament, and that the enjoyment of them is a privilege of ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable worth. We profeſs a high venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for theſe writings; becauſe they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a rich and inexhauſtible treaſure of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine knowledge, and becauſe they point out the only way to eſcape everlaſting miſery, and to obtain eternal life. We cannot teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify our gratitude for having the oracles of God committed unto us, if we do not ſearch into their meaning with diligence, and liſten to them with a humble and devout frame of mind. The man of real piety, delights in the law of the Lord, and in it doth he med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itate day and night. He crieth after knowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edge, and lifteth up his voice for underſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding; he ſeeketh her as ſilver, and ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth for her as for hidden treaſures. It is ſurpriſing to find in ſome perſons of mature age and good abilities, among the profeſſed
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:031762_0160_0FEE3F65E0C0BC30"/>friends of the Bible, but a ſmall acquain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance with its hiſtory or doctrines. Inſtead of attending to the word of the Lord their minds are ſwallowed up in worldly purſuits, or are diverted from the ſtudy of it, by books of wit and humour.</p>
               <p>MANY of the difficulties which occur in the reading of the ſcriptures, will be removed by comparing one paſſage with another, rel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ative to the ſame ſubject in different parts of thoſe writings. The doctrines which they contain that far ſurpaſs our comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, cannot be eradicated without giving up the ſacred volume into the hands of its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vowed enemies, and placing it on the ſame ground with the works of a heathen Plato, or Seneca. Thoſe who humbly wait on God will be guided into all neceſſary truths: "The meek will he guide in judgment; and the meek will he teach his way." Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers will be kept by the power of God through faith unto ſalvation.</p>
               <p>THERE is reaſon to expect from preſent appearances, and from the prophecies, that the church will meet with violent aſſaults from infidelity, between the period in which we live, and the time when "the earth ſhall be full of the knowledge of the Lord, as the waters cover the ſea." Now, when the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emy
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:031762_0161_0FEE3F6E8220F3D0"/>is coming in like a flood, we are loudly called upon to lift up a ſtandard againſt him. The performance of this duty, requires our attention to the arguments which demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the ſcriptures to be true, and from God; and our earneſt endeavours to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the faith which was once delivered unto the ſaints. Chriſtian teachers are under a peculiar and ſolemn charge, to continue in the things which they have learned of Jeſus Chriſt; and to labor to impreſs the belief on the minds of others, that <hi>all ſcripture is given by inſpiration of God, and is profitable for doctrine, for reproof, for correction, for inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in righteouſneſs.</hi> Above all, let every friend of revealed religion imbibe its ſpirit, and obey its laws. If we love the word of the Lord, we ſhall place a high value on the ſabbath, and on all divine inſtitutions: And ſhall bear teſtimony againſt the various cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes which diſhonor God, and tend to deſtroy mankind. Let parents teach their children the doctrines and duties of chriſtianity, and enforce their inſtructions by a holy example.</p>
               <p>DOTH the goſpel point out immortality to man, let this ſolemnize our minds, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite us to give diligence to make our calling and election ſure. Nothing can counter-balance the loſs of the ſoul. What are all
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:031762_0162_0FEE2F5F0E6618A0"/>the pleaſures, the riches, and the honors of the world, when compared with "an inher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itance incorruptible, and undefiled, and that fadeth not away!" Let us remember that the grace of God which bringeth ſalvation, "teacheth us, that denying ungodlineſs and worldly luſts, we ſhould live ſoberly, right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſly, and godly, in this preſent world; looking for that bleſſed hope, and the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious appearing of the great God and our Saviour Jeſus Chriſt."</p>

                              <salute>DEAR YOUTH,</salute>
                           </opener>
                           <p>YOU are coming into active life in a day very different, in ſeveral reſpects, from any former period. The late revolution in our country has extended its influence far and wide; and appears deſigned by providence to draw after it a train of conſequences, whoſe importance riſes to a height that baffles the calculations of the human mind. We are bound to give thanks to God for the rare privilege we enjoy of diſcuſſing ev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery ſubject as publicly as we pleaſe, and of expreſſing our ſentiments without reſtraint. It is a melancholy thought that when ſo wide a door is opened for the ſpreading of truth,
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:031762_0163_0FEE3F71AE6EA860"/>error and wickedneſs prevail. Popery and ſuperſtition have received a deep wound; at the ſame time infidelity lifts up its head, and open vices make ſwift and alarming pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs. The heart of man is the ſame now as it ever has been ſince the apoſtacy; but it ſhows itſelf in a different form from what it has uſually done among chriſtian nations, and calls in principles to juſtify its criminal indulgencies with more confidence than had before been ſeen. Many in our day give out that the age of reaſon is come, and that mankind may now determine for themſelves what is virtue and what is vice, without any regard to the ſcriptures. They ſeem to think themſelves at full liberty, in the ſight of God, to reject any revelation he may make, without incurrring his diſpleaſure. If our choice be the only rule of conduct that is binding upon us, we are placed in a lawleſs univerſe, and are not accountable to God.</p>
                           <p>PAUSE a moment—and reflect on the evil and danger of being led aſtray by opinions which flatter the pride of the heart, and are an inlet to every vice. If you regard your own peace and ſafety, you will not liſten to men who ſet their mouth againſt the heavens, and advocate the cauſe of licentiouſneſs.
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:031762_0164_0FEE3F734A9434C8"/>Look on the effects of infidelity upon thoſe who are ſcoffing at the Bible, and are ſtriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to influence others to treat it with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt. Do they appear to have the fear of God before their eyes? Can you believe that their real aim is to promote your true happineſs? A ſenſe of propriety, muſt ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a ſet of low characters diſguſting to you, who belch out their hatred of religion in the noiſy clubs, where ſerious thoughtfulneſs is baniſhed, and where ardent ſpirits animate the bluſtering hero of the night. Pity the poor creature who curſes the book which forewarns him of his awful fate, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands him to lead a life of temperance and ſobriety. From perſons of a different de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription you are in much greater danger of being proſelyted to infidelity. You may in your intercourſe with mankind, meet with deiſts whoſe talents are reſpectable, and whoſe addreſs is engaging. Theſe will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult your feelings, and will not ſhock you with a ſudden propoſal of renouncing the chriſtian faith; but will ſuggeſt doubts re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative to its hiſtorical truth, or the fitneſs of its doctrines, or the juſtice of its precepts.</p>
                           <p>IT is not to be expected that thoſe who have been trained up, from their childhood,
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:031762_0165_0FEE3F7CB3F60850"/>in the belief of the ſcriptures, will renounce them at once, and inſtantly take a leap into the abyſs of deiſm. Perſons who make this dreadful plunge, uſually advance towards it from ſmall beginnings. You will progreſs towards the gulph which has ſwallowed up the avowed enemies of the Bible, if you are in any degree entangled with what goes un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the name of <hi>Modern Liberality;</hi> which affirms, that it is a matter of perfect indiffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence what ſentiments any adopt for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligious creed. It is not pretended by chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, that a mere aſſent to revealed doctrines forms a good character; but they cannot be ſo abſurd as to allow that all opinions are alike friendly to virtue. Is it as probable that the man who believes in annihilation at death, will refrain from perjury, as he who believes that he ſhall exiſt in another world, and that there God will call him to an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for his conduct in this? Have we the ſame reaſon to look for purity in him who worſhips a ſtock or a ſtone, as in him who worſhips Jehovah? Infidels make high pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſions of liberality, as above defined: But if they ſpeak their real ſentiments, why do they make exertions to deſtroy the faith of others in the Bible? What cauſe can they aſſign for their zeal in proſelyting, if they eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teem
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:031762_0166_0FEE30ED9C2542E0"/>it to be perfectly indifferent what creed any one adopts?</p>
                           <p>WERE the Bible to periſh from among us, there would be no means left, ſufficient to prevent paying divine honors to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parted ſpirits of patriots and heroes, or even to the inanimate creation. The impious, obſcene, and cruel rites of paganiſm would be eſtabliſhed, ſhould chriſtianity ceaſe to enlighten us; and our religious ſtate would be the ſame with that of by far the largeſt proportion of mankind now on the earth. Human ſcience would not be found a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient guard to defend us againſt ſuch evils; for the learned Greeks and Romans were, at leaſt, as much given to idolatry, as the ſavages that roam in the deſert. The hiſtory of the whole heathen world from the days of Abraham until now, exhibits the ſame melancholy picture with Greece and Rome. A knowledge of the arts and ſciences is very uſeful; but cannot ſtand in the place of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine revelation.</p>
                           <p>IF any ſhould plead that the miſeries which have flown from corrupt rituals would be avoided by annihilating every form of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, they ſuppoſe a fact which can never generally happen, ſo long as hope and fear remain in the human breaſt. But if the e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:031762_0167_0FEE30F69B1C75D0"/>they contemplate could be realized, each individual would feel himſelf licenſed to live according to nature, and a ſcene of wretchedneſs would enſue, eſpecially in large communities, far ſurpaſſing any thing the world has hitherto ſeen. Neither prop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erty, nor chaſtity, nor life, would be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected; and the earth would groan under the horrors of the infernal regions.</p>
                           <p>BEWARE, dear youth, of drinking in the poiſon of infidelity. Embrace the religion which came from above, and make it the guide of your lives. In this choice you will find light, peace, and joy, and will be ſecured from falling into fatal ſnares. Joſeph, in the bloom of youth and beauty, was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected in a dangerous moment, by reverenc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the laws of Jehovah. He replied to the importunate ſeducer, <hi>How can I do this great wickedneſs, and ſin againſt God?</hi> Impartially review the evidences of the truth and inſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Bible. If you read this holy book with diligence and meekneſs, you will be charmed with the pure and benevolent ſpirit which it breathes; and will be fully perſuaded that no being but God can be its author. The miracles recorded in the Old Teſtament and in the New, and the fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:031762_0168_0FEE3F7E4DC6D330"/>of the prophecies, give a divine ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the ſcriptures.</p>
                           <p>TRIFLE not away the morning of life in vain amuſements, or in hearkening to fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles. You are not creatures of a day; but are born for eternity. The preſent momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary ſtate will be followed with conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of infinite importance. Secure without delay the glorious immortality ſet before you in the goſpel. From early life may you know the holy ſcriptures, which are able to make you wiſe unto ſalvation through faith which is in Chriſt Jeſus: To Him be glory for ever and ever. AMEN.</p>
