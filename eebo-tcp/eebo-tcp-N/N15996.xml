            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

It was juſt about eight o'clock in the evening of the 17th of June, when, not being apprehenſive of danger, we were ſet down to ſupper on a quarter of a buck, which one of our company had killed about two hours before; our arms and ammunition were about thirty rods diſtant; our little company as happy in their repaſt as good food and keen appetites could make them; and the fear of an enemy entirely ban<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

It may eaſily be conceived how aſtoniſhed we were at this ſalute, but no time for conſideration was given, for the ſavages, riſing from their ambuſh, had nearly ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, at the diſtance of about thirty rods. An opening towards the place where our arms were depoſited, was left which we ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly took the advantage of, and got ſafe to the ſpot: By this time we were totally ſurrounded, but determining to ſell our lives as dear as we could, we diſcharged all our pieces at the enemy.

            <p>After ſix days further very ſevere travel, we arrived at a large indian town. Here we were met by a great number of indians, men, women and children, who were no ſooner ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the loſs they had ſuſtained by our means, than they determined on putting us to the torture for revenge: We were both ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly ſtr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

lying within our reach, we determined to make an attempt to eſcape; we communicated our intention by ſigns to each other, and ſeizing the tomahawks ſunk them in an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant in the heads of the waking indians. We killed the others likewiſe without any noiſe, and ſnatching up our own knapſacks and clothes that lay in one corner of the wigwam, and taking each of us a knife, tomahawk and muſket, we iſſued forth and traveling all night, reached the top of a high mountain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> here we tarried near a week, feeding on roots, &amp;c. till our wounds began to heal, and then purſued our rout along the mountain, fearing to deſcend into the vallies, leaſt we ſhou'd fall into the hands of the inhuman ſavages, which we dreaded worſe than death itſelf.

latter part of September, and as we had travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at a great rate, we thought ourſelves out of the reach of the hoſtile indians, and thinking ſo beautiful a country muſt be deſigned for the ſuſtenance of ſome favored beings, we determined to deſcend into the vallies, and make what diſcoveries we could.</p>
            <p>We had paſſed ſeveral ſmall rivers on legs, and trunks of trees, &amp;c. which we found blown down and lying near their banks, but after travelling in the low lands about three weeks longer, in our old due weſt courſe, we arrived at the bank of a large river or ſea. We thought now that all our journeying weſtward, was at an end, however after tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velling along the bank of the river a few days we diſcovered a large canoe with paddles in it; this circumſtance made us fear we were rear ſome nation of indians, and as we were afraid of falling into the hands of ſavages, we determined, to embark, although the wind blow high from the eaſt, and accordingly jumping into the canoe, we ſoon rigged up a ſort of a maſt, and committed ourſelves to the mercy of the winds and waves.</p>
            <p>We had when we went on board, about ten days proviſion, which we determined to huſband to the beſt advantage as we were uncertain what proviſion we ſhould find on the weſtern ſhore.</p>
            <p>It was about the middle of the afternoon when we embarked, and as we ſailed at a great rate we were ſoon out of ſight of land, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver as the wind ſeemed rather to fall than ri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and the weather was clear, we apprehended no danger, but put on before the wind cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful expectation of reaching the weſtern ſhore next morning. But alas! how uncertain are all human proſpects; about midnight, we were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>After being carried at a ſurprizing rate for fifteen days, towards evening we perceived the current gradually changed its courſe, and ſet towards the ſhore, and that its force abated coſiderably.
