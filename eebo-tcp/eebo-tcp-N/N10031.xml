            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>SOME things which were but ju≈øt touched, or con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only in a general way, in the examination of Mr. Edwards, require a further and particular examination: And other things need a more di≈øtinct explanation: His denial of moral, rational liberty; his di≈øtinction of natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and moral nece≈ø≈øity; attributing the origin of evil to the want or withdraw of divine a≈ø≈øi≈øtance; ≈øeperating the obliquity of ≈øin from its cau≈øe; are ≈øome of the points that require a further <hi>examination.</hi> And tho≈øe that need a more di≈øtinct <hi>explanation</hi> are the doctrine of human liberty as maintained by the examiner, and the con≈øi≈øtency thereof with admitting the operation of motives in the choice and determinations of moral agents.</p>
            <p>The examiner hath the ≈øame opinion ≈øtill of the intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy of the ≈øubject as was expre≈ø≈øed in his former publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and means to proceed in it with caution and diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. If he may be ≈øo happy as to ca≈øt any light on the ab≈øtru≈øe ≈øubject of liberty and nece≈ø≈øity, or re≈øcue it in any important re≈øpect from its ob≈øcurity, his time will not be ill-employed. But the main thing in view all along has been to vindicate the moral character of the Deity from the injurious repre≈øentations, either of de≈øigning, or well-meaning but mi≈øtaken men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vi" facs="unknown:012746_0004_0F8BED8A788C5950"/>The ≈øcheme of nece≈ø≈øity, in oppo≈øition to ≈øelf-determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, cannot, he thinks, be defended on the principles of revelation or thei≈øm, if this one thing be admitted, that God is not the cau≈øe of moral evil. If it be affirmed, that he is the efficient cau≈øe of it, his moral perfections are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied. If moral agents them≈øelves are the efficient cau≈øe, this is to admit ≈øelf-determination.</p>
            <p>Some maintain only an hypothetic liberty. On their principles nece≈ø≈øity may be tenable‚Äî<hi>provided</hi> there is nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther holine≈øs nor ≈øin in the creation of God‚Äîno being wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of moral complacence or di≈øplicence, prai≈øe or blame.</p>
            <p>The examiner begs the reader to keep in mind this ≈øingle que≈øtion, <hi>Whether Mr. Edwards's doctrine makes God the efficient cau≈øe of all moral wickedne≈øs?</hi> He is him≈øelf clear in the affirmative of the que≈øtion, or would not have undertaken to examine Mr. Edwards's book. If this ≈øhould al≈øo be the reader's opinion, it is pre≈øum'd the ≈øcheme which contains or concludes in this will be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected. To reduce a <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> writer to this is ≈øufficient, without going any further. Nor will there be occa≈øion to ≈øhew how different ≈øuch a ≈øcheme is from the ≈øentiments of tho≈øe who have been e≈øteemed orthodox in the pure≈øt times of the church: It is with no great propriety, that Mr. Edwards makes it the caption of almo≈øt every ≈øection, that his foundation principles are the doctrines of <hi>Calvin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øm;</hi> and the oppo≈øite <hi>Arminiani≈øm. Pelagiani≈øm,</hi> &amp;c. Were it indeed ≈øo, what other purpo≈øe can this ≈øerve than to ca≈øt an odium, and fix a per≈øonal <hi>≈øtigma?</hi> But in truth, when have Calvini≈øts maintain'd, that the vicious wills of moral agents are derived from God, and unalterably fixed by his efficiency? that the fir≈øt exi≈øtence of ≈øin aro≈øe from the witholding his influence and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance? Should it al≈øo appear that Mr. Edwards's doctrine leaves no room for a di≈øtinction between rational and animal creatures in re≈øpect of liberty and agency‚Äîthat it concludes in favour of the mechani≈øm of the human mind, this is a ba≈øis on which Calvini≈øts have not built their ≈øcheme of doctrine.</p>
            <p>In ≈øome parts of the en≈øuing performance, the examiner hath been obliged to be more ab≈øtru≈øe than was his own choice; ≈øome readers might otherwi≈øe have thought him
<pb n="vii" facs="unknown:012746_0005_0F8BED8B3B432C50"/>
wanting in re≈øpect to Mr. Edwards, who≈øe book is repleat with ≈øuch rea≈øoning; abundant pains being taken this way to deduce his adver≈øaries to ab≈øurdity. But whate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver propriety there may be in oppo≈øing metaphy≈øics to metaphy≈øics, yet the examiner would a≈ø≈øure the reader, he hath taken care not to ≈øub≈øtitute any metaphy≈øics of his own for truth; but hath endeavoured to ≈øugge≈øt ≈øome <hi>plain</hi> things on what he takes to be the real truth in the pre≈øent debate. He de≈øires the reader would excu≈øe a few things that may appear ab≈øtru≈øe, and hopes the greater part of what he hath written will be thought ≈øufficiently clear, and adapted to do ≈øome good. The whole calls for the public candor, which he would not forfeit by writing with a ≈øour temper.</p>
            <p>He hath not been at all intimidated by the opinion or arguments of his remarker, who thinks <q>the grand pillars of Mr. Edwards's doctrine ≈øtand firm and un≈øhaken.</q> Nor hath he any apology to make for undertaking to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine Mr. Edwards's book. Tis enough, that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer treated "this great man" with no di≈ørepect in his fir≈øt publication, and determines not to in the pre≈øent.</p>

            <head>SECTION I. On Self-determination.</head>
            <p>WE ≈øhall fir≈øt explain the doctrine of human li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty in the ≈øen≈øe in which we maintain it. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, Make a few cur≈øory ob≈øervations on Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme of liberty.</p>
            <p>Power, motion and agency are terms of various ≈øignifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation. The two fir≈øt are frequently u≈øed in mechanics, and all of them may be applied to animal creatures. "Power may re≈øide in a ≈øubject that is no agent; as in the ca≈øe of phy≈øical or natural powers."</p>
            <p>When we ≈øpeak of the motions and revolutions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>animate bodies, it may amount to the ≈øame thing at la≈øt, whether we attribute the≈øe to an e≈øtabli≈øhed original law of nature, or to the con≈øtant agency of the Deity upon matter. The cour≈øe of nature is the con≈øtitution of the author of nature. It is demon≈øtrably not ≈øo fixed as to preclude ≈øpecial divine interpo≈øition, whereby the opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of ≈øecond cau≈øes is ≈øu≈øpended or counteracted. We cannot, indeed, determine how far this is the ca≈øe. Many events may be brought about (at lea≈øt in part) by ≈øecond cau≈øes, which we may imagine belong to the head of ≈øpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial interpo≈øitions, over-ruling tho≈øe cau≈øes. 'Tis difficult to a≈øcertain the powers of nature, as well as tho≈øe of moral agents.</p>
            <p>There is a ≈øen≈øe in which <hi>there is no power but of God.</hi> And if any chu≈øe to ≈øay, that natural cau≈øes (≈øo called) are really no cau≈øe at all; that God actuates all the powers of nature, and that from his energy every effect in the natural world proceeds, we have no objection to make. We only de≈øire it may be remembered, that mechanic powers, the motions of inanimate bodies, bear no re≈øemblance to, and give us no idea of, the powers of moral and accountable

creatures. Shou'd one undertake to illu≈øtrate con≈øciou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs by the vibrations of a pendulum, it would not be more ridiculous than a pretence to explain the powers of human nature by the motions of the planets, the growth of vegetables, &amp;c. The≈øe are ≈øo far from being any exem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plification of <hi>moral</hi> agency, that they bear no likene≈øs even to <hi>animal</hi> motion. For this is <hi>voluntary.</hi> And we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øume it will not be ≈øaid that voluntary motion is predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable of inanimate things‚Äînot even by tho≈øe <hi>philo≈øophers</hi> who have re≈øembled the powers of moral nature to tho≈øe of material bodies.</p>
            <p>Nor will the con≈øideration of <hi>animal</hi> motion and agency, any more than the motions of inanimate bodies, afford us any proper illu≈øtration of moral agency. Voluntary mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and exertion is indeed common to moral agents and the lower animals. The≈øe have natural power, foreca≈øte, memory, can move this way or that as <hi>they plea≈øe,</hi> or <hi>ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the determination of their will.</hi> They are agents‚Äî voluntary agents‚Äî'Tis apparent they "act electively"‚Äî from de≈øign‚Äîto certain ends. They are capable of being taught many things. From the ≈øagacity ≈øome of them di≈øcover, many have conjectur'd that they have an immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal ≈øpirit, and are accountable. This, we apprehend, is going too far, and find Mr. Edwards concurs with us.<note n="*" place="bottom">P. 41.</note> Whatever gradations there are in the creation, mankind appear to be the lowe≈øt order of <hi>intelligent moral</hi> agents. The appearances of rea≈øon in many of the brute creatures are ea≈øily accounted for without ≈øuppo≈øing them po≈ø≈øe≈øs'd of a moral faculty‚Äîin much the ≈øame manner as we ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for many in≈øtances of the conduct of ideots, who never had the exerci≈øe of this faculty; of madmen, who have lo≈øt it; and of children before they arrive to the exerci≈øe of it.

u≈øe to many who have rea≈øon for their guide. The ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal creatures are al≈øo the ≈øubjects of certain internal di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øitions and affections. They have a common care and tenderne≈øs for their young. Some of the feebler ≈øort a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øociate for the double purpo≈øe of protection and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon u≈øefulne≈øs. Some kinds of them are of a fierce, ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nomous, or ravenous di≈øpo≈øition; others are mild, gentle and harmle≈øs. "Spontaneous voluntary exertion" belongs to every ≈øpecies of them. But though ≈øpontaneous ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal motion may approach the neare≈øt to moral agency, of any thing in vi≈øible nature; yet it is e≈ø≈øentially diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thereform, nor doth it give us any proper idea there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of. A ju≈øt notion of moral agency we can derive only from attending to the nature and operations of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind‚Äînot from a contemplation of inanimate or ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate nature. <hi>The in≈øpiration of the Almighty hath given us under≈øtanding.

            <p>It ≈øeems, notwith≈øtanding, that ≈øome gentlemen need to be inform'd, that man hath a di≈øtinctive power from animals. We ≈øcruple not to ri≈øque the whole controver≈øy on their being able to point out a difference, ≈øtill retaining their own principles.</p>
            <p>Hard is our ta≈øk to be obliged to explain the difference between a man and a brute in regard of liberty and ≈øelf-determination.

            <p>The di≈øtinctive faculty of moral agents we before en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured to ≈øtate and explain‚Äîand we think it was ≈øhewn, that moral liberty really differs from animal, and that, "in finite beings placed upon trial, it implies an opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and capacity of chu≈øing and acting otherwi≈øe than they in fact do."<note n="*" place="bottom">Examination of Edwards, Part III.

≈øame thing, we de≈øire the capacity moral agents have of <hi>examining</hi> and <hi>con≈øidering</hi> before they make their choice, or proceed to act, in any given ca≈øe, may be well attended to. They can determine to con≈øider the rea≈øonablene≈øs or unrea≈øonablene≈øs of any propo≈øed object of choice‚Äîwhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be con≈øi≈øtent with, or contrary to, their duty‚Äîwhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be for their intere≈øt upon the whole‚Äîand con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, whether it is the part of wi≈ødom to chu≈øe or re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fu≈øe it. They have this power in regard to <hi>≈øpeculative</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, as well as with re≈øpect to life and conduct. They can examine the nature and evidence of what is propo≈øed to 'm for truth, and embrace or reject it as it ≈øhall appear to be true or fal≈øe upon diligent and impartial en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry; or give it that weight which its greater or le≈øs im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance ≈øhall demand. Error in principle is one great ≈øource of men's practical deviations from the paths of righteou≈øne≈øs. Hence it is, not infrequently, that they ju≈øtify and boa≈øt them≈øelves in a way that is not good, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agining they are doing God ≈øervice, when in reality they are fighting again≈øt him. Now ≈øo far as men judge wrong, and in con≈øequence thereof act wrong, thro' their own care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>le≈ø≈øne≈øs, or neglect, or through partiality in their enquiries af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter truth; ≈øo far they are criminal, and chargeable with all the practical con≈øequences of their wrong judgment. If the mi≈øtakes of mankind on <hi>practical</hi> ≈øubjects are ≈øearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the bottom, the probability is, that the greater part of ≈øuch mi≈øtakes will be found to proceed from that cau≈øe our Lord mentions, <hi>Every one that doeth evil, hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, lo≈øt his deeds ≈øhou'd be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</hi> And this is their condemnation.

            <p>Then in matters which more immediately re≈øpect the <hi>heart and life,</hi> moral agents have the ≈øame power of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining and attending to what is laid before them. Mo≈øt of their vicious elections and pur≈øuits probably proceed from want of attention and con≈øideration. They have a power of reflecting‚Äîof acquainting them≈øelves which is the wi≈øe choice and cour≈øe. But they do not ≈øtop and con≈øider what is before them‚Äîwhat choice they are about to make‚Äîwhat will be the con≈øequence in this world or another. Their conclu≈øions are precipitate, and they proceed to action as the hor≈øe ru≈øheth into the battle. What ≈øtrikes their external ≈øen≈øes, and promi≈øes a pre≈øent gratification to their particular affections, lu≈øts or pa≈ø≈øions, is wont to be greedily embrac'd and pur≈øued‚Äîwhat re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires ≈øome ≈øelf-denial and mortification of the≈øe is quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly rejected, before that faculty, which is naturally ≈øupream, and was given to direct and controul the bodily appetites, in≈øtincts and pa≈ø≈øions, can pa≈øs judgment in the ca≈øe. Wrong apprehen≈øions, wrong affections and conduct, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding in ≈øo many in≈øtances as they manife≈øtly do from the neglect of rea≈øon and reflection, ≈øhew of what va≈øt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance it is that moral agents ≈øet down and con≈øider be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they pa≈øs judgment, or make their election, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine what cour≈øe to take, in things that concern them. Experience concurs with the ≈øacred oracles in atte≈øting, that the want of attention and examination is a principal ≈øource of the fatal mi≈øtakes and mi≈øcarriages of mankind: And how cou'd it be expected it ≈øhou'd be otherwi≈øe, when the regulating faculty of our nature, in≈øtead of being im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prov'd in the ≈øearch of truth and duty, is u≈øed, if at all, as a ≈øervant to the ≈øen≈øitive appetites? This is a like contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction in morals as it is in civil life to ≈øee ≈øervants on hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øes, and princes walking like ≈øervants on the earth‚Äîor as if the feet ≈øhould u≈øurp the place of the head in the natural body.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:012746_0011_0F8BED9145F4A0B0"/>When in any given ca≈øe it is dubious what cour≈øe is our duty to take, or wou'd be mo≈øt prudent all things con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered, by deliberating on the matter we may come to be clearly ≈øatisfied; whereas if we proceed immediately to action, we are liable to err fatally‚Äîand ≈øhou'd it be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe, we can't have the plea≈øure of knowing that we are right‚Äî'tis accidental that we are ≈øo‚Äîwe merit no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation, but rather de≈øerve blame for runing the hazard of being in the wrong, when we might have obtained full conviction had we been at the pains, and given our≈øelves time, to reflect a few moments.</p>
            <p>Or ≈øuppo≈øe the ≈øen≈øe of duty is ≈øufficiently clear, but we are be≈øet by numerous and powerful temptations, have we not power to make a pau≈øe? By this means, we may ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ≈øuch a view of the particular evil to which we are en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed, ≈øuch con≈øiderations may be ≈øugge≈øted to our minds, as that a pre≈øent temptation, however ≈øtrong, ≈øhall not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, but gradually loo≈øe ≈øtrength and be overcome. Will you ≈øay that men in this ca≈øe have not power to forbear immediate action? to reflect a moment? Doubtle≈øs they have power to determine immediately with them≈øelves to con≈øider the matter. E≈øpecially mu≈øt they be admitted to have this power, if we take into the account the operations of divine grace on their hearts. In this way many good tho'ts are often injected in the moment of danger. May they not be cheri≈øh'd, and made our own? By reflections on the nature of virtue and vice; their rewards and pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øhments pre≈øent and future; the pa≈øt peaceable and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py fruits of the one; and contrary effects of the other, in our own experience, or ob≈øervation of others; by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the moral perfections and government of God; the per≈øon and offices of Je≈øus Chri≈øt, and calling to mind other con≈øiderations ≈øugge≈øted by the oracles of truth, the force of a pre≈øent temptation may be ≈øpeedily weakned thro' the influences of grace ≈øugge≈øting and concuring with ≈øuch moral con≈øiderations. While the force of con≈øcience is abated by ≈øtifling it's remon≈øtrances, and hearkning to the ≈øollicitations of lu≈øt and appetite in oppo≈øition there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to; it's ≈øen≈øibility is, on the contrary, proportionably in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crea≈øed by reflection and attention. Now to ≈øay that tho≈øe
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012746_0012_0F8BED92285AD750"/>
who live very much without moral reflection and attenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; therefore cannot determine otherwi≈øe with them≈øelves, is implicitly to deny that they have the faculty of rea≈øon. They can deliberate on the means and opportunities of gratifying their lu≈øts. What good rea≈øon can be offer'd to ≈øhew they have not power to turn their meditations in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to another channel?</p>
            <p>But as it is an important duty of moral agents to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øtom them≈øelves to diligent enquiry and mature con≈øide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that they may know what they ought to chu≈øe and pur≈øue, and what to refu≈øe and avoid, and not act as the hor≈øe and mule who have no under≈øtanding‚Äî≈øo it ≈øhou'd not be forgotten, that they ≈øometimes deliberate with a very different and oppo≈øite view‚Äînot to di≈øcover their duty where it is doubtful, but to explain it away where it is plain. In ca≈øes where an uprignt mind can be at no lo≈øs, but makes immediate choice, a di≈øhone≈øt heart will he≈øitate, and, under a notion of deliberating in order to di≈øcover what may or ought to be done, contriveth ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øes for the violation of a clear command. Sometimes great and ≈øcandalous vices are refined upon till they are tho't to be no vices; perhaps are transformed into vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues. Well were it if ≈øome men were as dexterous and ingenious, in calling to mind arguments to their duty as they are in finding out rea≈øons again≈øt it, and means of darkning and perplexing the ≈øen≈øe of it‚Äîas they are in the palliations and excu≈øes they contrive for their ≈øins, and in what they offer in ju≈øtification of them≈øelves. They had rather ≈øin with their eyes ≈øhut than with them open. Hence they take abundant pains to ob≈øcure the ≈øen≈øe and mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the plaine≈øt commands, that they may po≈ø≈øe≈øs the hope of religion, while they walk according to the cour≈øe of this world. A ≈øingle example will ≈øet this matter in a ≈øtrong light. Balaam, we read, loved the wages of unrigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teou≈øne≈øs, while he hoped to die the death of the righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teous. Hence he wou'd not go in <hi>direct</hi> contradiction to his duty in order to obtain Balak's reward, but ≈øet him≈øelf to reconcile his duty with his views of worldly gain and preferment. After God had plainly told him once, that he ≈øhould not cur≈øe I≈ørael, it was enough‚Äîhe ≈øhou'd have enquired no further, Yet after this he held
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012746_0013_0F8BED92B921BB80"/>
one con≈øultation and another with Balak's me≈ø≈øengers, and enquires of God again and again concerning the matter whereof he had already been fully certified. Not ≈øucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing according to his mind, though he per≈øi≈øted in his re≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution not to cur≈øe I≈ørael without an explicit divine per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion, yet he proceeded to <hi>coun≈øel Balak to lay a ≈øtumbling block before</hi> them, which prov'd their de≈øtruction. In this way he pacified his con≈øcience, while he as effectually broke over the divine in≈øtructions as if he had cur≈øed I≈ørael in the name of God. In many (perhaps mo≈øt) ca≈øes men's duty is plain at the fir≈øt propo≈øal. It is difficult to mi≈øtake it. In ≈øuch ca≈øes, deliberation is but a ≈øubterfuge to break o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver the obligation of it. Hence it is that men affect to doubt in the plaine≈øt matters, i. e. the mo≈øt important. By indirect means, they evade the ≈øen≈øe of moral and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious obligation, and keep all quiet within, while they do tho≈øe things in <hi>effect,</hi> which they wou'd ≈øtart back at the thought of doing in a <hi>direct</hi> manner. Had they made their choice and acted according to the fir≈øt appearance of things, they wou'd have cho≈øen the good and right way: But ≈øome favourite hypothe≈øis mu≈øt be maintain'd, ≈øome lu≈øt or pa≈ø≈øion gratified, at all events; and hence it is that they labour to reconcile things contrary, as light and dark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, righteou≈øne≈øs and unrighteou≈øne≈øs. 'Tis hard to give up the hopes of religion, but harder to ≈øacrifice their worldly views.</p>
            <p>Some (and the≈øe men of fine parts) have gone further, and pro≈øtituted their ≈øuperior talents in embelli≈øhing vice, and attempting to take off from it it's ju≈øt odium; em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploying their powers in the cau≈øe of infidelity, ≈øaping the foundation of every religious principle, and con≈øequently of all virtue. As though the gift of rea≈øon were be≈øtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on us to ≈øub≈øerve the gratification of the appetites and pa≈ø≈øions‚Äîthat we might make our≈øelves more vile than the bea≈øts that peri≈øh‚Äîmight ≈øin with more <hi>delicacy</hi> and <hi>malignity</hi> indeed, but with no remor≈øe. We cou'd wi≈øh there were not ≈øo great a ≈øimilarity between the writings of ≈øome authors of this ≈øtamp, and Mr. Edwards's book on the will.</p>
            <p>That attention and examination, which, as moral agents,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012746_0014_0F8BED937AF8B5D0"/>
we are capable of, and is our bounden duty, is of ≈øuch evident importance that to the neglect of it are attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in ≈øcripture mo≈øt of the ≈øins and mi≈øeries of men. <hi>My people will not con≈øider. O that they were wi≈øe, that they‚Äîwould con≈øider!</hi> Con≈øideration is repre≈øented as nece≈ø≈øary to, and a likely means of, the reformation of ≈øinners. And the exhortation to <hi>con≈øider our ways</hi> is in effect the ≈øame as that, <hi>amend your ways.</hi> This capacity of con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and judging, of di≈øtingui≈øhing virtue and vice, "and their fruits in the pre≈øent life, which are the proper ≈øam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of" their con≈øequences in another, is an important di≈øtinction of mankind from the animal creatures, and ≈øhews that the former determine them≈øelves in a ≈øen≈øe which the latter do not. E≈øpecially when we further con≈øider, that "≈øhou'd rea≈øon neglect it's po≈øt, con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence is appointed as an in≈øtinctive kind of monitor, perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually to remind us both of our intere≈øt and our duty." The animal creatures act as impelled by in≈øtinct and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petite. They have not a power of deliberating, rea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, reflecting‚Äîthey wait only for an opportunity of acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, without being able to con≈øider the con≈øequences. And when moral agents act without con≈øideration, they forget the di≈øtinction put on their nature, and <hi>ha≈øte as a bird to the ≈ønare, not knowing it is for their life.</hi>

            <p>By ≈øu≈øpending judgment, election and action, new rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons often ari≈øe to the mind‚Äîmany times diver≈øe from, and oppo≈øite to, tho≈øe fir≈øt extant in it, and an overmatch for them.

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012746_0015_0F8BED9441424018"/>
and reflecting with the former view, a full per≈øua≈øion may be begotten in the mind that <hi>that</hi> is truth, which be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore was ≈øuppo≈øed to be fal≈øhood or error‚Äîthat which was doubtful may be clear'd up‚Äîthe path of duty may become plain‚Äînew arguments in ≈øupport of truths before receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed may be ≈øugge≈øted‚Äînew inducements to profe≈øs and live according to them.

            <p>On the contrary, tho≈øe who ≈øu≈øpend and deliberate from the latter view mentioned above, ju≈øtly expo≈øe them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves to be given over to ≈øtrong delu≈øions; their fooli≈øh heart becomes darkned, and hardened through the deceit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulne≈øs of ≈øin. They become an ea≈øy prey to the god of this world, who is permitted to blind their eyes, ≈øo that the arguments and motives of rea≈øon and religion have little or no weight with them.</p>
            <p>Much the ≈øame may be ≈øaid of tho≈øe, who≈øe lu≈øts and pa≈ø≈øions <hi>precipitate</hi> their moral judgment, as of the more deliberate workers of wickedne≈øs who take much pains to darken and bribe it. They alike expo≈øe them≈øelves to be delivered over to the will and power of the deceiver of the nations, the enemy of all righteou≈øne≈øs.</p>
            <p>But it is objected, that ≈øu≈øpending implies, the mind hath already made its choice; that is, it hath cho≈øen to deliberate and examine‚Äîthat the difficulty, therefore, ≈øtill returns, and the cau≈øe of this determination to ≈øu≈øpend re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be pointed out.</p>
            <p>To this we an≈øwer, that a moral agent either hath pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er to <hi>originate</hi> an act of ≈øu≈øpen≈øion, and ≈øo bring him≈øelf into the view of new motives; or the ≈øu≈øpending act pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds from a motive extant in his mind at the ≈øame in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtant with ≈øome motive to immediate election or action. The former will not be allowed, as it would be at once to admit ≈øelf-determination. And on the latter ≈øuppo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, the motive to ≈øu≈øpend, mu≈øt be <hi>previous</hi> to the act of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012746_0016_0F8BED94FA73F188"/>
≈øu≈øpen≈øion, el≈øe it cannot be the cau≈øe of that act‚Äîcannot move or excite to it. There mu≈øt be the exertion of the cau≈øe before the effect can take place. But if the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to ≈øu≈øpend be previous to the act of ≈øupen≈øion, then the other motive to immediate election and action mu≈øt determine the will <hi>till</hi> the motive to ≈øu≈øpend has produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed its effect: That is, the agent is determined, his choice is made, before he determines to ≈øu≈øpend; the act of ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen≈øion is an after act. In other words, there is, proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ≈øpeaking, no ≈øu≈øpen≈øion at all. Or viewing the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the mo≈øt favourable light, it will ≈øtand thus: A moral agent cannot be the ≈øource of ≈øu≈øpen≈øion in him≈øelf. No motive <hi>ab extra</hi> to ≈øu≈øpend being extant in his mind, he mu≈øt immediately make his choice. To ≈øay he had a power of awakening in him≈øelf a motive to ≈øu≈øpend, or of negativing a pre≈øent motive to action, would be to a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øert ≈øelf-determination; or to ≈øay, that the act of ≈øu≈øpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion had already taken place, which, by ≈øuppo≈øition, can be only in con≈øequence of ≈øome previous motive. There was, then, a temptation exhibited to the mind of Lucifer, while a ≈øon of the morning, to ri≈øe up in rebellion again≈øt the Mo≈øt High. It had po≈øitive influence to excite and move him to this thing. He had no intrin≈øic power to negative it, or to ≈øu≈øpend election, or view the temptation in any other light than he in fact did. It nece≈ø≈øarily de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined him.

Thus ≈øin and mi≈øery came into the world. Here is the true ≈øource of all the wickedne≈øs of men and devils.

            <p>There can, ≈øtrictly ≈øpeaking, be no motive to the choice and determination of a <hi>rational</hi> creature, but ≈øuch as com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports with the dignity of his nature, con≈øcience being al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways con≈øidered as ≈øupreme. Hence motives of intere≈øt, honor, plea≈øure, are motives to pur≈øue what is, <hi>upon the whole,</hi> beneficial, honorable, plea≈øurable‚Äînot what may <hi>ca≈øually</hi> gratify the lower affections and appetites, in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition to rea≈øon, to the true intere≈øt, dignity and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of a moral and accountable creature. To ≈øay, that ≈øuch a creature, in ca≈øe of a competition of objects, cannot ≈øtop and con≈øider <hi>which</hi> rea≈øon directs to, and govern him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf accordingly, is either to deny him the power of reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or to ≈øuppo≈øe him given over to a reprobate mind. When the animal propen≈øities and the dictates of rea≈øon are at variance, (as they often are) may not the former be negatived? And is it not ≈øomewhat of a ≈øoleci≈øm to ≈øay, a rational creature can have a motive to act unrea≈øonably? In a loo≈øe way of ≈øpeaking, we are indeed wont to ≈øay, that the covetous, ambitious and voluptuous have motives to the pur≈øuit of unju≈øt gain, unlawful plea≈øure, and to make their way to preferment by di≈øhonorable means. But it may be worthy of con≈øideration, whether, in ≈øtrict propriety, a motive to ≈øuch a choice and pur≈øuit, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicts the leading and di≈øtingui≈øhing principle of our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, really de≈øerves to be called a motive to ≈øuch a being as man? Be this as it will, we evidently have a power of deliberating, reflecting, or ≈øu≈øpending‚Äîof con≈øidering what is before us‚ÄîMoral agents <q>have a capacity of being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluenced in their actions by moral inducements and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, exhibited to the view of <hi>under≈øtanding and rea≈øon, to engage to a conduct agreable to the moral faculty.</hi>
               </q> This capacity in moral agents, admitted and maintain'd by Mr. Edwards, is a demon≈øtrable proof of ≈øelf-determination, as it implies the power of ≈øu≈øpending, which we have been arguing for. A power of ≈øu≈øpending election and action is plainly a power of determining whether we will be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by rea≈øon and the principles of religion, or not.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012746_0018_0F8BED96850F6130"/>
And can this power be allowed to moral agents con≈øi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tently with the denial of ≈øelf-determination? <note n="*" place="bottom">A learned and very worthy friend, on peru≈øing what we had wrote on the article of ≈øu≈øpending pre≈øent volition, deliberating, &amp;c. was plea≈øed to ≈øugge≈øt, that <q>as it mu≈øt depend on the moral agent <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf,</hi> whether he will ≈øu≈øpend, con≈øider, &amp;c. and con≈øequently is a full proof, or rather the actual exerci≈øe, of ≈øelf-determination; ≈øo <hi>this may be the foundation of an entire difference between God and the creature.</hi> There is no room for con≈øideration, or any act or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erci≈øe ≈øimilar to it in God, becau≈øe of his omni≈øcience. But the vertue of an intelligent creature depends much, very much, not to ≈øay wholly, upon it.</q>

            </p>
            <p>While the agency of the animal creatures is as nece≈ø≈øary as the rotation of the earth and revolutions of the planets, the cau≈øe of <hi>moral</hi> volitions is in the mind it≈øelf which is the ≈øubject of them, as will appear, we apprehend, from a little attention to the moral faculty of under≈øtanding. This regulating power of moral agents ideots and madmen have not, and therefore are not moral agents any more than brutes. And though, as was ≈øaid before, the motions of inanimate bodies or of animals are not ≈øimilar to moral agency; yet were the dictate of the moral faculty follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed without deviation, mankind would as regularly fill up their place in the creation, as the lower animals do theirs ‚Äîas regularly as the ≈øea≈øons revolve, or the heavenly bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies move. There would be as great harmony in moral nature as appears in the other works of God.</p>
            <p>Superior intelligences, in other worlds, we may ≈øuppo≈øe, are as regular to the duties of their ≈øtation, and fulfil the plea≈øure of the Creator with a like punctuality and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtancy, as the luminaries of heaven ≈øhine. That men on earth do not, in their mea≈øure, fulfil his will as it is done by higher orders of beings in heaven, is their ≈øin; as they have the ≈øame general faculty to direct and govern 'em, how much ≈øoever the inhabitants of the world above may <hi>excel in</hi> intellectual <hi>≈øtrength.</hi> Were there not a proper cau≈øe in the mind, the exerci≈øes and actions of mankind wou'd uniformly be ≈øuch as the order of our nature points out. And the ≈øuppo≈øition of the <hi>fall</hi> of angels or men wou'd be as wild, as the ≈øuppo≈øition of the everla≈øting mountains moving out of their place, or the interruption of the harmony of the ≈øpheres. At lea≈øt it wou'd be view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012746_0019_0F8BED9739F7EB88"/>
in no other light than any alteration in the material world, or ≈øu≈øpen≈øion of the laws of nature. The latter might as well be judged criminal and morally evil as the former. If the cau≈øe of the exerci≈øes and actions of moral agents be not in them≈øelves, then the Deity is the proper efficient cau≈øe of them. Now we ≈øee that all his operati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, all the effects of his agency in the material world and animal nature, are uniform and harmonious‚Äîthe ≈øame from age to age. If the moral exerci≈øes and conduct of rational accountable beings proceed from the efficiency of the ≈øame cau≈øe, from the ≈øame lover of order and harmony, why then are they ≈øo irregular and out of cour≈øe? This ≈øingle con≈øideration is enough to ≈øatisfy us, that the mind of a moral agent is the true cau≈øe of his own election, and actions. <note n="*" place="bottom">The effects of divine agency in the natural world being uniform, while moral volitions and actions are not ≈øo, is a clear proof that the latter are not, in like manner, the product of divine operation. For as Mr. Edwards maintains, that the moral world is the end of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural, can it be that the God of order acts out of cour≈øe in events of a <hi>moral</hi> nature, which are of by far the greate≈øt moment, while in <hi>natural</hi> events he ob≈øerves a ≈øtated method of operation? The ≈øuppo≈øition of the divine agency in ≈øin, moreover, confounds the di≈øtinction between the agency or influence of God, and that of the devil. And further, how can that influence, which holy beings are under, be holy in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to its cau≈øe, unle≈øs that which vicious beings are under is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to be wicked in reference to it's cau≈øe. However, the devil is not the <hi>cau≈øe</hi> of men's ≈øins, though it is through his in≈øtigation that they fall into ≈øin.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The author of our beings is the proper cau≈øe of our moral capacity‚Äîthe father of our ≈øpirits. This capacity the effect of his in≈øpiration, is the proper cau≈øe of voliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. It may be well improved, or neglected and perverted. There are created beings who have improved it well, as there are who have perverted it. The latter might have made the ≈øame u≈øe of it as the former, and herein wou'd have fallen in with the de≈øign of the creator, and been workers together with God for his glory and their own felicity and honour. Therefore the perver≈øion of this capacity is not to be attributed to God as the cau≈øe: <hi>For God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man.</hi> In their innocent ≈øtate, men and angels were capable of attending to the calm dictates of rea≈øon‚Äîof perceiving clearly the
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:012746_0020_0F8BED97F848A930"/>
≈øuperiority of this principle to the in≈øtincts and appetites of animal nature. There was nothing "in their wills" that cou'd indi≈øpo≈øe them to attend to the voice of rea≈øon. God made them upright‚Äîde≈øigned they ≈øhou'd continue ≈øo, and gave them power to abide in their fir≈øt ≈øtate‚Äîin the knowledge, love and enjoyment of him≈øelf. And how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever this depended on continu'd divine communications, the≈øe wou'd not have been withdrawn till the creature had fir≈øt abu≈øed and forfeited them‚Äîas is propo≈øed to be ≈øhewn in the ≈øequel. The able≈øt philo≈øophers and divines have maintain'd, that God originally endow'd mankind with freedom of will‚Äîthat from the abu≈øe of this "freedom all mi≈øery and ≈øin, all natural and moral evils, derive their exi≈øtence‚Äîit being more eligible that" man "≈øhou'd be" created "a free agent, than a mere machine."<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>"There is a <hi>gradation</hi> or ≈øcale of a≈øcent of the principle of action among creatures, in proportion to their perfection‚ÄîThe fir≈øt being is the ≈øole principle of action in all <hi>inanimate matter.</hi> In <hi>animal motion,</hi> the animals them≈øelves are admitted into a ≈ømall participation of the production of the effect, as they have the direction of ≈øome motions, or the power of beginning them. <hi>Brutes</hi> and <hi>men</hi> are thus far ≈øpontane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous with regard to the motions of their bodies.

            <p>It may be difficult exactly to determine what the powers of human nature now are, or what they were in Adam in his innocent ≈øtate. We may yet ≈øafely a≈ø≈øert, that his duty did not exceed his abilities as he came out of the forming hands of God. To ≈øay it did, wou'd be impeaching the maker and governor or the world with the inju≈øtice which the ≈øervant in the parable complain'd of, <hi>Thou art an hard ma≈øter, reaping where thou ha≈øt not ≈øown.</hi> And ≈øhall we pre≈øume to ≈øay of him who is righteous altogether, that he

demanded improvement beyond the number of talents gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? If not, then the fall of man was not owing to any want of power to continue upright, but to his abu≈øe of original ability. His dependance on divine influence for the pre≈øervation of his moral rectitude, as well as of his exi≈øtence, proveth nothing to the contrary, if it be true, that <hi>that</hi> influence wou'd not have been withheld, had not man, by ≈øome act of rebellion, incur'd the forfeiture of it. For we pretend not that any creature ever had an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent power, either for the purpo≈øes of life or godline≈øs. But the creature may neglect or abu≈øe what he hath re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived; and in con≈øequence of that, what he hath may be taken away. Man, therefore, had at fir≈øt ≈øuch powers and communications from God as were ≈øufficient to his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing and improving in the knowledge, in the moral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øemblance and enjoyment of his maker. His original ≈øin appears to have been a neglect of rea≈øon and ha≈øty li≈øtning to the ≈øollicitations of appetite. In all probability it was a very ≈øudden act. By this he forfeited the pre≈øence and grace of God; whereof he was immediately convinc'd, and fear'd to appear before that glorious being who≈øe di≈øplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øure he had incurred, and with whom his corre≈øpondence before was mo≈øt intimate. But upon the exhibition of a ≈øavior to him, under the character <hi>of the ≈øeed of the woman,</hi> his hopes revived. With the delivery of this original promi≈øe to him, he was put under a capacity of recovering by repentance and faith in the ≈øeed promi≈øed what he had lo≈øt by hearkning to the tempter. In this promi≈øe <hi>life and ble≈ø≈øing</hi> were again ≈øet before him, and his offended creator ≈øaid to him, <hi>Chu≈øe life.</hi> Whatever power was lo≈øt, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever inability incur'd, by the fir≈øt apo≈øtacy, in <hi>regeneration,</hi> a ≈øimilar power is re≈øtor'd as man in innocency had‚Äînot indeed a power of living wholly without ≈øin; but a gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral habit of holine≈øs; ≈øuch exerci≈øes and di≈øpo≈øitions of heart as conform the creature to the creator, and which in ≈øcripture are ≈øignified by being <hi>renewed after the image of God‚Äîrenewed in the ≈øpirit of our minds‚Äî≈øanctified in Chri≈øt Je≈øus</hi>‚Äîbeing <hi>new creatures,</hi> &amp;c. Out of a regard to the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diator, great and precious promi≈øes are made to the apo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate ≈øons of men-particularly the promi≈øe of the aids of the

≈øpirit, through which alone any are renewed in know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and become partakers of God's holine≈øs. Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and faith in Chri≈øt hold the ≈øame place in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion of a fallen creature, as un≈øining obedience did in that of our progenitors while they remained upright. By the go≈øpel God calleth upon all men every where to repent, and believe in his ≈øon for reconciliation and ≈øalva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He al≈øo gives his ≈øpirit with his go≈øpel, of which unregenerate men receive a mea≈øure. And to him that hath ≈øhall be given, and he ≈øhall have abundance. We do not a≈øcribe any ≈øelf-derived, independent power, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to unregenerate or regenerate men; but ≈øuch only as they have received from God, of which they are not, ≈øtrictly ≈øpeaking, the proprietors, but ≈øtewards. The lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter are faithful ≈øtewards of the gifts and grace of God; the former are unfaithful, and wa≈øte his goods. And what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever impotency is derived to us from the human apo≈øtacy, 'tis ≈øufficient that in regeneration ≈øuch power is re≈øtor'd as is equal to the purpo≈øes of ≈øalvation‚Äîthat as men have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived grace, ≈øo God is ever ready to ≈øupport them in duty, while they acknowledge their dependance, and draw nigh to him. <hi>For every one that a≈øketh, receiveth; and he that ≈øeeketh, findeth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The things that have been offered are ≈øufficient to prove, that moral volitions proceed from a cau≈øe in moral agents them≈øelves, and to explain in what ≈øen≈øe we main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain this.

                  <p>Further to illu≈øtrate and confirm the ≈øubject of our pre≈øent en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry, we beg leave to make ≈øome quotations from a writer of great merit.</p>
                  <p>"The true rea≈øon why a per≈øon cannot complain of being made an≈øwerable for an action, is, that he has <hi>produced</hi> it him≈øelf knowingly and willingly‚Äîis the real <hi>author,</hi> the <hi>productive cau≈øe,</hi> of his actions‚Äî the good or bad effects from thence ari≈øing may be ju≈øtly attributed and referred to him, as to the <hi>efficient cau≈øe</hi>‚Äîthe <hi>author or moral cau≈øe.</hi> Every thing almo≈øt that is ≈øaid and done in human ≈øociety ≈øuppo≈øes this principle generally received, and every body acquie≈øceth in it from an inward conviction‚ÄîEvery action or omi≈ø≈øion ≈øubject to the direction of man, can be charged to the account of the per≈øon in who≈øe power it was to do it or let it alone: and on the contrary, every action, who≈øe exi≈øtence or non exi≈øtence does not depend on our will, cannot be imputed to us. Ob≈øerve here, that omi≈ø≈øions are ranked by civili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans and morali≈øts among the number of actions; becau≈øe they appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend them as the effect of a voluntary ≈øu≈øpen≈øion of the exerci≈øe of our faculties.‚Äî</p>
                  <p>We may impute to a per≈øon every action or omi≈ø≈øion, of which he is the <hi>author</hi> or <hi>cau≈øe,</hi> and which he could or ought to have done or o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted.‚Äî</p>
                  <p>With regard to another per≈øon's actions, they cannot be imputed to us, but in as much as we have concurred to them, and as we could and ought to have procured, hindered, or at lea≈øt directed them after a certain manner. The thing ≈øpeaks for it≈øelf. For to impute ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther man's actions to a per≈øon, is declaring that the latter is the <hi>effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent,</hi> though not the only cau≈øe thereof; and con≈øequently that this action depended in ≈øome mea≈øure on his will, either in its principle or execution‚Äî</p>
                  <p>It is not ≈øufficient to have enlightened the mind in re≈øpect to the nature of tho≈øe goods and evils that are capable of rendering us really happy or unhappy; we ≈øhould likewi≈øe give <hi>activity</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> to the≈øe principles, by forming the will ≈øo as to determine it≈øelf by ta≈øte and habit, pur≈øuant to the coun≈øels of enlightened rea≈øon. And let no one think it impo≈ø≈øible to change our inclinations, or to reform our ta≈øtes. It is with the ta≈øte of the mind, as with that of the palate. Experience ≈øhews, that we may alter both, ≈øo as to find plea≈øure at length in things that before were di≈øagreable to us. We begin to do a thing with pain, and by an effort of rea≈øon; afterwards we fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liari≈øe our≈øelves to it by degrees; then a frequency of acts renders it ea≈øier to us, the repugnance cea≈øeth, we view the thing in a different light from what we did before; and u≈øe at length makes us love a thing that before was the object of our aver≈øion.‚Äî</p>
                  <p>‚ÄîOur mind inclines naturally to that ≈øide which ≈øeems the mo≈øt probable; but this does not debar it from ≈øu≈øpending its a≈ø≈øent, in order to ≈øeek for new proofs, or to refer the whole enquiry to a future opportunity.‚Äî</p>
                  <p>In re≈øpect to things that are evident. It is always in our power to apply our minds to the con≈øideration of tho≈øe things, or el≈øe to divert them from thence, by transfering ≈øomewhere el≈øe our attention. This fir≈øt determination of the will, by which it is led to con≈øider or not to con≈øider the objects that occur to us, merits particular notice, becau≈øe of the natural influence it mu≈øt have on the very determination, by which we conclude to act or not to act, in con≈øequence of our reflexion and judgment. Secondly, we have it likewi≈øe in our power to <hi>create,</hi> as it were, evidence in ≈øome ca≈øes, by dint of attention and enquiry; whereas at fir≈øt ≈øetting out, we had only ≈øome glimmerings, in≈øufficient to give us an adequate knowledge of the ≈øtate of things. In fine, when we have attained this evidence, we are ≈øtill at liberty to dwell more or le≈øs on the con≈øideration thereof; which is al≈øo of great con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence, becau≈øe on this depends its greater or le≈ø≈øer degree of im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈ø≈øion.‚Äî</p>
                  <p>To prove that man is indeed a free agent‚Äîlet us therefore con≈øult only our≈øelves. Every one finds that he is ma≈øter, for in≈øtance, to walk or ≈øit; to ≈øpeak or hold his tongue. Do not we al≈øo experience continually, that it depends entirely on our≈øelves to ≈øu≈øpend our judgment, in order to proceed to a new enquiry? Can any one ≈øeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ou≈øly deny, that in the choice of good and evil our re≈øolutions are uncon≈øtrained; that, notwith≈øtanding the fir≈øt impre≈ø≈øion, we have it in our power to ≈øtop of a ≈øudden, to weigh the arguments on both ≈øides, and to do, in ≈øhort, whatever can be expected from the free≈øt a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent.‚ÄîI find I can ab≈øtain from any particular good; I can defer u≈øing it; I can prefer ≈øomething el≈øe to it; I can he≈øitate in my choice, in ≈øhort, I am my own ma≈øter to chu≈øe, or, which is the ≈øame thing, I am <hi>free</hi>‚Äî</p>
                  <p>Sen≈øible proofs like the≈øe are ≈øuperior to all objection, and produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of the mo≈øt inward conviction, by rea≈øon it is impo≈ø≈øible, that when the ≈øoul is modified after a certain manner, it ≈øhould not feel this modification, and the ≈øtate which con≈øequently attends it. What other certainty have we of our exi≈øtance? And how is it we know that we think, we act, but by our inward ≈øen≈øe?</p>
                  <p>This ≈øen≈øe of liberty is ≈øo much the le≈øs equivocal, as it is not mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary or tran≈øient: It is a ≈øen≈øe that never leaves us, and of which we have a daily and continual experience‚ÄîReflections, deliberations, re≈øearches, actions, judgments; all ≈øuppo≈øe the u≈øe of liberty. Hence the ideas of good and evil, of vice and virtue: hence, as a natural con≈øequence, ari≈øes prai≈øe or blame, the cen≈øure or approbation of our own, or other people's conduct. The ≈øame may be ≈øaid of the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and natural ≈øentiments of men towards one another, as friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øhip, benevolence, gratitude, hatred, anger, complaints and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es: None of the≈øe ≈øentiments could take place unle≈øs we were to admit of liberty. In fine, as this prerogative is in ≈øome mea≈øure the key of the human ≈øy≈øtem, he that does not allow it to man, ≈øubverts all order, and introduceth a general confu≈øion.</p>
                  <p>It is natural here to enquire, how it was ever po≈ø≈øible for any body ≈øeriou≈øly to doubt, whether man is ma≈øter of his own actions, whether he is free? I ≈øhould be le≈øs ≈øurprized at this doubt, were it concerning a ≈øtrange or remote fact, a fact that was not tran≈øacted within our≈øelves. But the que≈øtion is in regard to a thing, of which we have an internal immediate feeling, a con≈øtant and daily experience. Strange, that any one ≈øhould call in que≈øtion a faculty of the ≈øoul! May not we as well doubt of the under≈øtanding and will, as of the liberty of man? For if we are content to abide by our inward ≈øen≈øe, there is no more room to di≈øpute of one than of the other. But ≈øome too ≈øubtile phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lo≈øophers, by con≈øidering this ≈øubject in a <hi>metaphy≈øical</hi> light, have ≈øtript it, as it were of its nature; and finding them≈øelves at a lo≈øs to ≈øolve a few difficulties, they have given a greater attention to the≈øe difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties than to the po≈øitive proofs of the thing; which in≈øen≈øibly led them to imagine that the notion of liberty was all an illu≈øion.‚ÄîWe are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by experience, that in ≈øeveral things which, in re≈øpect to us are in re≈øted with the highe≈øt degree of certainty, there are many dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties notwith≈øtanding, which we are incapable of re≈øolving to our ≈øatisfaction: And this is a natural con≈øequence of the limits of the mind. Let us conclude therefore from hence, that when a truth is ≈øufficiently evinced by ≈øolid rea≈øons, whatever can be objected again≈øt it, ought not to ≈øtagger or weaken our conviction, as long as they are ≈øuch difficulties only as embarra≈øs or puzzle the mind, without inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidating the proofs them≈øelves.</p>

               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:012746_0025_0F8BED9D3A726700"/>He defines liberty thus: <q>Liberty is power, opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity or advantage that any one has to do as he plea≈øeth. If he is able, and there is nothing in the way to hinder his <hi>pur≈øuing</hi> and <hi>executing</hi> his will, the man is fully and perfectly free.</q> Whence it is manife≈øt, that Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards had no other notion of liberty than what re≈øpects external action or conduct. <note n="*" place="bottom">Tho≈øe who de≈øire particular ≈øatisfaction that Mr. Edwards held no other liberty may examine p. 38, 39, 40; 76, 77; 132; 189; 191; 213; 214, 215; 234; 236; 259.‚Äî&amp;c. &amp;c.</note> The plea≈øure of the mind, and acting or conducting according to it, are entirely dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent. The <hi>act of volition</hi> or <hi>choice</hi> is a different thing from the <hi>pur≈øuit</hi> or <hi>execution</hi> of what is willed or cho≈øen. And if liberty con≈øi≈øts in the latter only, it cannot be at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qui≈øite to moral agency and accountablene≈øs. There may be a willing or an unwilling mind when there is not "pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, opportunity or advantage for one to do as he plea≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth." And moral agents, it is conceded, may be worthy of prai≈øe or blame in ca≈øes where they <hi>cannot</hi> execute their wills, by rea≈øon of external <hi>impediment or re≈øtraint</hi>‚Äîand in ca≈øes where they are <hi>compelled</hi> to act contrary to their wills. And where natural nece≈ø≈øity doth not take place, it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceded, that virtue or vice con≈øi≈øts not in the external doing or forbearing, but in the ≈øtate and di≈øpo≈øition of the mind or will. Now as, on Mr. Edwards's principles, the whole of liberty con≈øi≈øts in a "power or opportunity to do as one plea≈øeth‚Äîto <hi>pur≈øue and execute</hi> his will;" it clearly follows, that liberty, according to his definition of it, is not e≈ø≈øential to virtue or vice, prai≈øe or blame, Yet he affirms it is nece≈ø≈øary and e≈ø≈øential hereto.</p>
            <p>Mr. Edwards's rea≈øoning on this point, reduced to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per form, will ≈øtand thus: Liberty is e≈ø≈øential to prai≈øe or blame. Liberty con≈øi≈øts in a man's pur≈øuing and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting his will. Ergo, If he he cannot execute his will,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012746_0026_0F8BED9DFB5DD0A0"/>
he cannot be worthy of prai≈øe or blame. Would Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards abide by this con≈øequence? If not, let any one re≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cue his doctrine from it.</p>
            <p>In truth, whether moral agents ≈øhall execute their wills depends not on them≈øelves. Their natural liberty may be abridged of taken away, and yet their freedom as ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable creatures remain. If then liberty be really ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary to prai≈øe of blame, it mu≈øt con≈øi≈øt in a power either to chu≈øe or refu≈øe that wherein virtue and vice con≈øi≈øt. And con≈øequently the will it≈øelf, its ≈øtate, volitions or acts, mu≈øt be determined by moral agents them≈øelves‚Äîat lea≈øt in ≈øome in≈øtances, and within a certain mea≈øure. There is no occa≈øion to add any thing further to what we before wrote on this point, Examination part I. ≈øect. 3. and part III. ≈øect. 1.</p>
            <p>But admitting Mr. Edwards maintained <hi>internal</hi> free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom: We a≈øk, of what ≈øort? <hi>moral</hi> freedom, or only <hi>ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mal?</hi> The latter may be called <hi>natural</hi> liberty, as well as the freedom of the executive powers be ≈øo denominated. But it is not e≈ø≈øential to prai≈øe or blame. Ideots, lunatics and brutes have this liberty, but are not therefore moral agents. Virtue or vice, reward or puni≈øhment depend not on the having this liberty. Yet Mr. Edwards admits no other. If he means any thing by the <hi>freedom of the ≈øoul as a moral agent,</hi> it is this, that moral agents are ≈øo framed, have ≈øuch di≈øpo≈øitions con-created with them, or infufed into them by the author of their beings, that they exerci≈øe freely what is created with or infu≈øed into them, and can do no otherwi≈øe. The ≈øtate and bias of the mind, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular bent of their wills, by which all their pur≈øuits are determined, is fixed by nece≈ø≈øity. As ≈øuppo≈øe one hath a propen≈øity to intemperance; another to uncleanne≈øs, a third to theft, a fourth to covetou≈øne≈øs and extortion, a fifth to pride, malice or revenge, &amp;c. in exerci≈øing, pur≈øuing or executing the≈øe different pa≈ø≈øions they are re≈øpectively free, they act as they plea≈øe, or according to their will; but have no hand in the <hi>formation</hi> of the≈øe various propen≈øities. <q>Let them come by their</q> ≈øeveral inclinations and propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øities <q>

            <head>SECTION II. On the influence of motives in moral vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litions.</head>
            <p>THE near relation this part of our ≈øubject hath to the preceeding naturally leads us to ≈øuch ob≈øervations as may be explanatory of the things already offered, and ≈øtrengthen their evidence: While what hath been ≈øaid may an≈øwer the ≈øame purpo≈øe with re≈øpect to what we ≈øhall now offer on the relation motives have to the voliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of moral agents.</p>
            <p>The whole di≈øpute turns on the deci≈øion of this que≈øtion, Whether moral agents have a principle of <hi>efficiency</hi> in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves? In what follows, we ≈øhall endeavor further to ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the affirmative.</p>
            <p>By motives we mean external rea≈øons or inducements exhibited to the view of a moral agent. Mr. Edwards, in a more general way, intends (as we ≈øuppo≈øe) an extrin≈øic moral cau≈øe, by the term motive. <note n="*" place="bottom">We are very ≈øen≈øible he had no <hi>fixed</hi> meaning to this word in his writings. We took notice of his vague and arbitrary u≈øe and appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of it, Examination ≈øect. 2. part I ‚Äîparticularly p. 26. marg. In the ≈øen≈øe he ≈øometimes u≈øeth the word [motive] it is not <hi>extrin≈øic</hi> to the mind, nor even <hi>antecedent</hi> to volition, nor <hi>di≈øtinct</hi> from it‚Äîcon≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, hath not a <hi>tendency</hi> to excite volition, is not the <hi>cau≈øe,</hi> nor ≈øo much as the <hi>occa≈øion</hi> of it. To ≈øpeak of the <hi>preponderation and preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency</hi> of motive implies that the mind is already determined; that its choice is made. And hence a preponderating, prevalent motive is not the determiner of the mind's election. The cau≈øe of this is ≈øtill to be ≈øought ≈øomewhere el≈øe. One while Mr. Edwards blends motive and volition‚Äîat another time he makes the former the moral cau≈øe of the latter‚Äîthen again intimates that motive is not a proper <hi>efficient,</hi> but only an <hi>occa≈øion</hi> of volition‚Äîthen turns about and blends percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and action.</note>
            </p>
            <p>He affirms motives to be moral cau≈øes, by way of di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:012746_0029_0F8BEDA0398F90B0"/>
from natural cau≈øes; and, according to his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoning, they produce their effects in the ≈øame way‚Äîthat is, through the divine energy. Moral effects nece≈ø≈øarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the <hi>efficiency</hi> of their cau≈øe‚Äîmoral cau≈øes are as <hi>ab≈øolute</hi> as natural. (P. 103; 261, &amp;c.)</p>
            <p>It might be abundantly ≈øhewn that Mr. Edwards a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribes efficiency to motives, from his whole book; and more e≈øpecially from Part II. Sect. 10. But we ≈øhall only quote the following from p. 134, 135. in confirmation hereof. <q>If motives excite volition, then they are the CAUSE of it's being excited‚ÄîTo excite, is po≈øitively to <hi>do</hi> ≈øomething; and certainly that which does ≈øomething, is the CAUSE of the thing <hi>done</hi> by it. To create, is to cau≈øe to be created; to make, is to cau≈øe to be made‚Äî to quicken, is to cau≈øe to be quickened; and <hi>to excite,</hi> is <hi>to cau≈øe to be excited.</hi> To excite, is to be a cau≈øe in the mo≈øt <hi>proper</hi> ≈øen≈øe, not meerly a negative occa≈øion, but a ground of exi≈øtence by po≈øitive influence. The notion of <hi>exciting,</hi> is exerting influence to cau≈øe the effect to ari≈øe or come forth into exi≈øtence‚ÄîThe <hi>production</hi> of an effect is certainly the <hi>cau≈øing</hi> of an effect; and <hi>produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive influence</hi> is <hi>cau≈øal influence,</hi> if any thing is; and that which has this influence prevalently, ≈øo as thereby to become the ground of another thing, is a cau≈øe of that thing, <hi>if there be any ≈øuch thing as a cau≈øe.</hi>
               </q> Tho≈øe who are ≈øtill di≈øpo≈øed to que≈øtion whether Mr. Edwards a≈øcribes cau≈øality or efficiency to motives may call to mind the ≈øtory he tells of the animal in <hi>Terra del Fuego.</hi> (p. 282.)</p>
            <p>However, we ≈øee not what advantage can accrue to Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme, or what injury to our own, ≈øhould it be granted, that upon his plan motives are not, in a ≈øtrict ≈øen≈øe, the cau≈øe of moral volitions. For if ≈øo, what was he about when he wrote his book? Was it not his decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red de≈øign to point out the cau≈øe of volition? Doth he not labour abundantly to prove, that this cau≈øe mu≈øt ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more be that motive, which, in the view of the agent, is highe≈øt? If by this moral cau≈øe, as he ≈øpeaks, nothing more be meant than the <hi>occa≈øion</hi> of volition, not the cau≈øe in a ≈øtrict and proper ≈øen≈øe, how has he then an≈øwered the que≈øtion propo≈øed, viz. "What determines the will? To
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:012746_0030_0F8BEDA0F77EF860"/>
≈øay that motive is the occa≈øion of the will's determination; is nothing to the purpo≈øe. We want to be directed to the <hi>efficient.</hi> This enquiry is of no le≈øs importance than it is to know the proper cau≈øe of every moral event. It Mr. Edwards did not ≈øuppo≈øe motives to be efficient cau≈øes, volition can have no ≈øuch cau≈øe at all on his ≈øcheme.‚ÄîIn other words, there could be no ≈øuch effect as a moral vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition. For a moral effect cannot exi≈øt without a cau≈øe any more than a natural effect: And Mr. Edwards denieth that the ≈øubject of ≈øuch volition, can be the efficient or producer of it, So that to deny motives efficiency to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce volition, is, upon his principles, to ≈øay, that all moral events are without a cau≈øe‚Äîrather, that there are no ≈øuch events exi≈øting.</p>
            <p>Should it be ≈øaid, that creatures to whom moral agency belongs are the proper efficients of their own volitions, this would be directly to admit our doctrine‚Äîto a≈ø≈øert a ≈øelf-determining power, and make this the foundation of prai≈øe and blame, rewards and puni≈øhments. Should it be ≈øaid that the fir≈øt cau≈øe is the proper efficient of every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral volition, this would rather increa≈øe than relieve the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty. For it equally militates with Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme to ≈øuppo≈øe a ≈øelf-determining power in the creator, as in the creature. And then to a≈øcribe the ≈øinful voliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of creatures to divine efficiency, is to affirm that God is the proper cau≈øe and author of wickedne≈øs. In every view Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme is ≈øtrangely embarra≈ø≈øed. It is conceded, that every moral volition hath an efficient cau≈øe. And is it a trivial point whether this cau≈øe be ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to be in the ≈øubject of ≈øuch volition, or extrin≈øic to him?</p>
            <p>As, on Mr. Edwards's principles, the efficient cau≈øe of the moral volitions of creatures mu≈øt be either extrin≈øic motive, or God him≈øelf through the intervention of motive, each of the≈øe ca≈øes ≈øhall be di≈øtinctly examined: And if neither of them can be maintained, the other opinion mu≈øt be the truth, that moral agents are the cau≈øe of their own volitions.</p>
            <p>Now it cannot be that motives are them≈øelves efficient cau≈øes. For an efficient mu≈øt needs be an agent. A mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:012746_0031_0F8BEDA34536AFB0"/>
efficient mu≈øt be a mu≈øt agent. <q>Ab≈øtract notions (as all rea≈øons and motives are</q>) are not agents. Or ≈øhould it be ≈øaid that moral agency belongs to them, it would no way ≈øerve Mr. Edward's cau≈øe. For if motives are agents, then they are them≈øelves determined by motive. To be an efficient is to act, and action implies agency. If motives are not agents, then either the ≈øubject of a moral volition is al≈øo the moral cau≈øe of it, or ≈øome other agent is that cau≈øe. To ≈øay ≈øome other agent is the cau≈øe, is ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to a≈øcribe ≈øelf-determination to this ≈øuppo≈øed cau≈øe, or to run back the efficient of volition <hi>in infinitum.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Edwards him≈øelf ≈øaith, that the act of volition is determined <hi>always</hi> by that in the mind's view of an object, which <hi>cau≈øeth it to appear</hi> mo≈øt agreable, not by the agre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able appearance <hi>it≈øelf;</hi> for this, in his opinion, is nothing <hi>di≈øtinct</hi> from volition (P. 11, 12.) This matter was par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly con≈øidered, Examination, part I. ≈øect. 2. To ≈øave the reader (and our≈øelves al≈øo) the trouble of repetition, we beg leave to refer moreover, to the notes p. 91,‚Äî95.</p>
            <p>If motives are not them≈øelves efficients, let us next en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire, whether God is the efficient cau≈øe of all moral voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in the creatures through the medium of motives. Now in a moral e≈øtimation, it makes no difference, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the Deity be the <hi>immediate</hi> or <hi>mediate</hi> cau≈øe of ≈øin and moral turpitude. To ≈øay he is the efficient in either ≈øen≈øe is equally and infinitely reproachful to him. To ≈øay, the will nece≈ø≈øarily follows the la≈øt dictate of the under≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing‚Äîthat the under≈øtanding follows the appearance of things <note n="*" place="bottom">

and di≈øpo≈øed by the governor of the world, is ultimately to a≈øcribe all moral evil to his efficiency. But how con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtently with his moral character? For can it be that the efficient cau≈øe of wickedne≈øs is not wicked?</p>
            <p>Suppo≈øe a parent, who had given it in charge to a child, be ≈øure to ≈øhun this and the other vice, ≈øhould yet lay be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ≈øuch child the ≈øtronge≈øt temptations to the vices cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion'd again≈øt, would not the child naturally conclude that the parents admonitions are only words of cour≈øe? that he ≈øhou'd not affront, but plea≈øe his parent, by li≈øtning to the enticements of his own propo≈øing? Would not all men lay the blame to the parent for ≈øeting invincible temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations before a child? Now the ≈øuppo≈øition that the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent of the world exhibits to the minds of his rational offspring, in an irre≈øi≈øtible manner, motives to vice, is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally more reproachful, ≈øince (by ≈øuppo≈øition) 'tis through his operation and efficiency with them that vice is produ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced, as the nece≈ø≈øary effect. Doth the father of angels and men (who compared with him are children in under≈øtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing) ≈øeduce them in this manner, taking advantage of their ignorance and weakne≈øs, and exert his own influence for their ruin? When Mr. Edwards ≈øays, <q>God is the ≈øource of all moral ability and agency,</q> (p. 42.) doth he mean that he is the ≈øource of all moral evil? There is a ≈øen≈øe in which this ob≈øervation is doubtle≈øs true. But if a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine efficiency in ≈øinful volitions was meant to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preheded under it, this is greatly to err.</p>
            <p>But if motives are not efficient cau≈øes, nor the Deity through the intervention of them, then moral agents them≈øelves are. If the cau≈øe of volition be not extrin≈øic, it mu≈øt be intrin≈øic, in the agent him≈øelf; which is to ≈øay, in other words, that moral agents are ≈øelf-determined.</p>
            <p>By affirming this we mean not, however, to deny the influence of motives in moral volitions. We may admit the operation of motives on moral agents without attribut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cau≈øality to motives. They are rea≈øons exhibited to us to determine our≈øelves by; but are not moral cau≈øes, as hath been ≈øhewn from the nature of them, and from Mr. Edwards's own doctrine on the article of motives.</p>
            <p>Still it may be ≈øaid, If moral agents <hi>invariably</hi> determine
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:012746_0033_0F8BEDA4B846FB80"/>
them≈øelves according to the greate≈øt apparent good, this effectually e≈øtabli≈øheth the doctrine of moral nece≈ø≈øity; and, con≈øequently, proves that the highe≈øt motive <hi>nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates</hi> volition, if it be not, ≈øtrictly ≈øpeaking, the <hi>cau≈øe</hi> of it.</p>
            <p>This matter requires a careful examination. For with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out determing at pre≈øent, whether a principle of cau≈øation in the mind or agent, in di≈øtinction from motive, is or is not reconcileable with moral nece≈ø≈øity; the admi≈ø≈øion of this would, doubtle≈øs, much weaken the evidence of the point we contend for. It mu≈øt be allowed, that if the volitions of moral agents <hi>always</hi> are <hi>as the greate≈øt apparent good is,</hi> this amounts to a proof of nece≈ø≈øity in the <hi>philo≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phic</hi> ≈øen≈øe of the word. Is there, then, ≈øuch a con≈øtant and unfailing connection or coincidence between volition and the greate≈øt apparent good, as is pretended? We are clear in the opinion there is not.</p>

earth, and <hi>vice ver≈øa;</hi> it will not follow that the ≈øame thing mu≈øt hold true as a general principle in regard to mankind upon trial. It was not fact in reference to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øtate ≈øpirits, and mankind in their fir≈øt ≈øtate.</p>
            <p>We have not pretended to ≈øtate the <hi>degree</hi> of moral li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty, or <hi>≈øphere</hi> of its exerci≈øe by moral agents. All that we have argued for is this, that accountable creatures either have, or at lea≈øt originally had, a freedom to chu≈øe <hi>differently</hi> from what they do. This is no more than the generality of reformed divines have maintained. A liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of <hi>indifference</hi> we have no where a≈ø≈øerted. For though we agree with Dr. Watts and ≈øome other writers, who u≈øe this term, in the thing they intend by it; yet as we do not entirely approve the manner of expre≈ø≈øion, ≈øo we have ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver once u≈øed this term to expre≈øs our ≈øen≈øe of liberty.</p>
            <p>Mr. Edwards repre≈øents tho≈øe writers who argue for a liberty of indifference, particularly Dr. Watts, as meaning hereby two contrary things, neither of which was their ≈øentiment. He more generally would have it, that they mean <hi>perfect</hi> indifference, or <hi>equilibrium.</hi> But he has al≈øo intimated by his own u≈øe of the word, (p. 9.) that his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents mean, by indifference, ≈øomething neither <hi>agreable</hi> nor <hi>di≈øagreable,</hi> eligible or the contrary. The≈øe are two notions of indifference, altogether diver≈øe, and even contrary. (One thing may be far from being <hi>ab≈øolutely</hi> indifferent, while another is preferable.) However, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of the≈øe was the notion of indifference maintain'd by the authors Mr. Edwards oppo≈øeth. The ≈øen≈øe in which they a≈ø≈øert liberty of indifference is preci≈øely this‚Äîa free<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>dom in moral agents to chu≈øe <hi>otherwi≈øe</hi> than they do‚Äî what was called in the ≈øchools, <hi>Libertas indifferentiae ad op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øita,</hi> 
               <q>a liberty of indifference to chu≈øe one thing, or its oppo≈øite.</q> Such a ≈øen≈øe of liberty is ≈øo far from being the peculiar notion of <q>
                  <hi>Pelagians, Semi-Pelagians, Je≈øuits, Socinians, Arminians,</hi> and others</q> of the ≈øame ≈øtamp, as Mr. Edwards injuriou≈øly repre≈øents, <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 89.</note> that it has been maintained by the mo≈øt eminent divines called <hi>Calvini≈øts,</hi> as we ≈øhall be ready to ≈øhew ≈øhould there be occa≈øion. The examples of ≈øuch a liberty, in the defection of beings made upright, are far from being the only ones that might be

                  <p>We might mention in≈øtances of the will's determination, in which there is no <hi>perceptible</hi> preference, either in the object it≈øelf fixed upon, or in the circum≈øtances of it. If there is no apprehended preference, or perceivable rea≈øon for chu≈øing, between two objects, the mind mu≈øt ≈øu≈øpend it's determination forever, according to Mr. Edwards. For <q>whatever is a motive mu≈øt be ≈øomething <hi>extant in the view of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving faculty.</hi>
                     </q> (P. 8.) Yet Mr. Edwards admits, that two or more given things may appear <q>
                        <hi>exactly alike, one as good as another</hi>‚Äîas ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe two eggs, or two cakes</q>‚Äîthere is no preference, at lea≈øt none perceived by the mind, as he allows, in the≈øe ca≈øes. Is then the will determined by, or <hi>as</hi> the greate≈øt apparent good in ≈øuch in≈øtances? He mu≈øt ≈øuppo≈øe ≈øo. And indeed he in≈øi≈øts, that in all ≈øuch in≈øtances the mind hath two or more <hi>general</hi> determinations, before it comes to a <hi>particular</hi> determination or choice. He ≈øuppo≈øeth the mind hath a real preference, if not of the object cho≈øen, yet of its own action‚Äî that it gives it≈øelf up (very <hi>deliberately</hi>) to <hi>accident.</hi> (Doth he mean, that this is done with an expectation that <hi>chance</hi> will direct the mind to the wi≈øe≈øt choice?) Is not this trifling! If there be no apprehended preference, the mind cannot determine, or be determined at all, by his principles. In the in≈øtances he had before him, he grants there is no apprehended preference of one object to the other. Here he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerves, <q>The very act of chu≈øing one thing rather than another, is prefering that thing.</q> What <hi>preference</hi> is there in the in≈øtances refered to? On what <hi>ground</hi> or <hi>rea≈øon</hi> is one cho≈øen? To ≈øay there is an act of choice, implying <hi>preference,</hi> between two objects <hi>exactly alike</hi> in every apparent re≈øpect, and yet no previous ground or rea≈øon of that preference, is very hardly reconcileable with Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme, or common ≈øen≈øe. We believe it will not be doubted by the genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of mankind, but innumerable in≈øtances occur every day of the will's determination without any perceptible preference. There are determinations, which we beg leave to call <hi>arbitriums,</hi>‚Äîimplying no prepollency of motive‚Äînot excited by the <hi>greate≈øt apparent</hi> good, nor <hi>as</hi> this is‚Äînor the contrary; with re≈øpect to which the mind is <hi>in aequilibrio.</hi> However, ≈øuch <hi>arbitriums</hi> ≈øeem not to belong to the ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of <hi>morality</hi> and <hi>religion.</hi> They ≈øtill ≈øubvert Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme of nece≈ø≈øary connection.</p>
                  <p>"The exerci≈øe of liberty," ≈øays the learned Burlamaqui, <q>never di≈øplays it≈øelf more than in indifferent things. I find, for in≈øtance, that it depends entirely on my≈øelf to ≈øtretch out or draw back my hand; to ≈øit down or to walk; to direct my ≈øteps to the right or left, &amp;c. On the≈øe occa≈øions, where the ≈øoul is left entirely to it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, either for want of external motives, or by rea≈øon of the oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition, and, as it were, the equilibrium of the≈øe motives, if it deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mines on one ≈øide, this may be ≈øaid to be the pure effect of its plea≈øure and good will, and of the command it has over its own actions.</q> Vol. I. p. 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>As to the mind's giving it≈øelf up to <hi>accident,</hi> this ca≈øe is wrongly ≈øtated. Where the mind has a full per≈øua≈øion there is no preferable<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of one ob≈øect to another, is in≈øtantly convinc'd they are exactly alike, it cannot be ≈øaid to give it≈øelf up to accident. It hath no choice or preference, is perfectly indifferent (not whether it hath <hi>either,</hi> but) <hi>which</hi> it hath. It doth not tarry to make one general re≈øolution after another before it comes to a conclu≈øion; but determines immediately. If the mind may be ≈øaid to give it≈øelf up to accident at all, it is in in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances where it is well known in general, that the i≈ø≈øue of its deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination may be either fortunate or unfortunate; but neither being extant in the minds view beforehand, and the event being altogether independent of any human circum≈øpection, the mind determines with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a perception of the con≈øequences‚Äîwhich it leaves to time and fortune. As in purcha≈øing tickets in a lottery.</p>
                  <p>To pretend, that though the mind has no preference of the <hi>object</hi> cho≈øen, in things indifferent, yet it hath of it's own <hi>act,</hi> is frivolous.</p>

            <p>Virtuous or vicious elections mu≈øt proceed upon motive. And we grant that the greate≈øt good really <hi>ought</hi> to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine moral agents; but that it in fact always <hi>doth,</hi> even where it is perceived, we deny. Where there is both a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>evident</hi> preferablene≈øs, there can be no di≈øpute as to the <hi>obligations</hi> of moral agents. But even where there is a manife≈øt as well as real preference, their election is not <hi>always</hi> governed hereby. 'Tis too common, indeed, that the pa≈ø≈øions bias and pervert the moral judgment. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times they <hi>precipitate</hi> this judgment, when a little reflecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would have been ≈øufficient to pre≈øerve the rectitude of it.

it, (in the manner ob≈øerved in the preceeding ≈øection) to find out palliations, excu≈øes, or ju≈øtifying circum≈øtances for vice, that men may indulge their various lu≈øts, and yet be on good terms with their con≈øciences. By ≈øuch means, the light in men becomes darkne≈øs; they call evil good, and good evil; put bitter for ≈øweet, and ≈øweet for bitter.</p>
            <p>Still we think nothing is more evidently fal≈øe than the opinion, that the affections evermore follow the la≈øt prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical judgment of the under≈øtanding. Perception and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition are as different as ≈øight and ta≈øte. Moral agents ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny times ≈øin immediately again≈øt pre≈øent light and convicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, while they have <hi>full in their view</hi> the wi≈øer choice. And what is this but to determine them≈øelves contrary to the greate≈øt apparent good? Through the impetuo≈øity of their lu≈øts and pa≈ø≈øions, they break over the cleare≈øt bonds,

natural, civil and religious‚Äîthe force of which they have ≈øometimes a lively ≈øen≈øe of even in the article of ≈øining; perceiving the direct tendency of ≈øuch violations to ruin them in this world and another. So far are they from acting on the view of the greate≈øt apparent good, that they have a pre≈øent ≈øight of the ruinous con≈øequences of that ra≈øh and mad conduct they determine upon.</p>
            <p>Every delaying ≈øinner acts again≈øt the greate≈øt apparent good, while he promi≈øeth him≈øelf a future time of repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and repenteth not immediately. When ≈øuch hear the importance and excellency of religion repre≈øented in ≈øome judicious moral di≈øcour≈øe, or ≈øee the ≈øame exemplifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in real life, they highly approve it in their judgment; they ≈øee it to be their wi≈ødom; but their practice is at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance with the <hi>apparent</hi> good‚ÄîSo much at variance, that they are obliged to make ineffectual promi≈øes of becoming wi≈øe ≈øoon, and are much di≈ø≈øatisfied with them≈øelves that they have not been long ago. The ≈øituation of many great ≈øinners on a ≈øick bed, in the apprehen≈øion of death, is wont to alarm others of a like character. They ≈øee the right and good way; but per≈øi≈øt in their ≈øins again≈øt their <hi>evident</hi> intere≈øt.</p>
            <p>Different con≈øiderations are adapted to influence diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent per≈øons, who have diver≈øe apprehen≈øions of intere≈øt, according to the diver≈øity of their temper and talents, education and circum≈øtances. But to confound all di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction between motives and moral habits, as Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards doth, is to blend things that differ‚Äîto contradict rea≈øon and him≈øelf. For he tells us, volition <hi>follows</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, is <hi>excited</hi> by it, and the <hi>effect</hi> of it‚Äîthat motives are <hi>extrin≈øic</hi> cau≈øes. Surely then they are different from volition. And if (as has been ≈øhewn) volition is not <hi>al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways</hi> as the highe≈øt motive; then, when the≈øe really meet, it is not <hi>nece≈ø≈øarily;</hi> that is, not in the way Mr. Edwards contends for. One in≈øtance failing, the chain is broken. One link, or "10,000, breaks the chain alike."</p>
            <p>Motives exhibited to a moral agent may be ≈øtrong or weak according to the attention given to them. Mo≈øt pre≈øumptuous ≈øins may proceed from ≈øudden pa≈ø≈øion or inattention. It has been hinted, that Adam's fir≈øt ≈øin may
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:012746_0038_0F8BEDA8777E0E00"/>
be accounted for in this way. And if the <hi>manner</hi> of the mind's viewing an object may be the cau≈øe of its chu≈øing or refu≈øing, (as Mr. Edwards ob≈øerves) we enquire, Whence is it, but from a cau≈øe <hi>in it≈øelf,</hi> that the mind views an object as it doth?</p>
            <p>On Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme and our own, extrin≈øic mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives are concerned, as they have <hi>po≈øitive influence,</hi> in moral volitions. The difference is, Mr. Edwards (more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally) teacheth, that they are moral cau≈øes<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> and that the will and the highe≈øt motive nece≈ø≈øarily unite. We a≈ø≈øert, that moral agents are them≈øelves the efficients of their own volitions, and that there is no ≈øuch nece≈ø≈øary union between volition and the highe≈øt motive. The advantage our ≈øcheme hath may, perhaps, appear from applying the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine wherein we are agreed with him to a particular ca≈øe ‚Äîthat of the fir≈øt ≈øinful volition of the prince of darkne≈øs. The motive to this volition was extant in his mind. It had <hi>po≈øitive influence</hi> to excite and move to the volition. His rebellion was the con≈øequence. Was it therefore the greate≈øt <hi>apparent</hi> good? Had he a principle of action within him≈øelf, either to concur with or reject the exhibited motive? If he had, then the cau≈øe of this volition was in him≈øelf, and our doctrine of ≈øelf-determination is e≈øtabli≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. If he had not, then let it be granted that the motive exhibited was the efficient of the volition. But what ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage will this conce≈ø≈øion be to Mr. Edwards's cau≈øe? It follows from it, either that this efficiency is ultimately to be a≈øcribed to God, and that the energy or cau≈øality is ultimately his; (≈øince by his di≈øpo≈øing and determining providence ≈øuch efficacious motive to rebel was pre≈øented to the view of an innocent and holy being) or that God him≈øelf is properly no moral cau≈øe, but ≈øubject, as crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures are ≈øuppo≈øed to be, to ≈øome extrin≈øic efficiency and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination. And indeed this is the true re≈øult of Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme. The divine being is not ≈øelf-deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined‚Äîis no proper efficient cau≈øe. <hi>Fatali≈øts</hi> and <hi>Athei≈øts</hi> will not fail to make improvement on this ≈øy≈øtem. On the ≈øubject of moral agency, it is therefore of great impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to keep up a di≈øtinction between the <hi>influence</hi> of motives, and <hi>cau≈øality</hi> or <hi>efficiency.</hi>

               <pb n="42" facs="unknown:012746_0039_0F8BEDAAC6F48480"/>To ≈øay that volition ≈øprings from it≈øelf, is a very diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent thing from ≈øaying, that the ≈øubject is the cau≈øe of it. Dr. Watts did not deny that volition hath a cau≈øe, as Mr. Edwards would in≈øinuate; but maintain'd, that an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent ≈øpirit is the cau≈øe of it's own volitions.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, it is agreed that moral agency may con≈øi≈øt with the want of ≈øpontaneous, animal agency, or the liberty of the <hi>executive</hi> powers. Be≈øides, where there is neither force nor impediment from without, the exertion of our natural powers depends on our being <hi>willing</hi> to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert them; but whether we are willing, depends not at all on our≈øelves. For though <q>our actions proceed from our wills,</q> yet <q>our wills mu≈øt be derived from the di≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øitions implanted in us by the author of our being.</q> Such is Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme. Where, then, is liberty! where moral agency! what pre-eminence hath a man a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove a bea≈øt! The lower animals follow the in≈øtincts and di≈øpo≈øitions implanted in them originally, or in which they are "accidentally educated." They have not a moral faculty, indeed: But if this makes only a <hi>con≈øtitutional</hi> or <hi>adventitious</hi> difference in their elections and actions, it is a difference no way material; ≈øince ≈øuch accidental diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rences make no beings either virtuous or vicious. It ≈øeems apparent, that Mr. Edwards has totally excluded liberty from every thing wherein the nature of virtue and vice is properly concerned.</p>

            <head>SECTION III. On nece≈ø≈øity.</head>
            <p>TO make his doctrine of univer≈øal nece≈ø≈øity con≈øi≈øtent with moral agency and accountablene≈øs, Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in≈øi≈øts much on <hi>two</hi> kinds of nece≈ø≈øity; one of which he calls natural; the other, moral. It is needful to exhibit his doctrine, and make a few remarks thereon, that the reader may judge of the merits of this di≈øtinction. After which ≈øome things will be ob≈øerved with a view, if po≈ø≈øible, to ca≈øt a little light on the ab≈øtru≈øe ≈øubject of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity, rendered more ab≈øtru≈øe than before, by Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward's refinements and ≈øubtilties.</p>
            <p>He frequently adverti≈øeth his readers, that when he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plieth the term <hi>nece≈ø≈øity</hi> to moral ≈øubjects, he u≈øeth it "as a term of <hi>art</hi>"‚Äîthat when the words <hi>nece≈ø≈øary, impo≈ø≈øible, irre≈øi≈øtible, unable,</hi> &amp;c. are applied to moral agency, they are <q>either u≈øed in ≈øome new ≈øen≈øe diver≈øe from their o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riginal and proper meaning, or with perfect in≈øignifican<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce and non≈øen≈øe: For no inability what≈øoever, which is meerly moral, is properly called by the name of inabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity.</q> (P. 21, 22, 232, 287. <hi>et pa≈ø≈øim.</hi>) Did not Mr. Edwards then mean by moral nece≈ø≈øity any <hi>real</hi> nece≈ø≈øity? Did he u≈øe words as "non≈øen≈øically" as other metaphy≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians?</p>
            <p>While in common ≈øpeech no proper nece≈ø≈øity at all is meant by the u≈øe of the terms moral nece≈ø≈øity, <note n="*" place="bottom">When in common ≈øpeech it is ≈øaid, that any particular things are morally nece≈ø≈øary, or morally impo≈ø≈øible, by way of di≈øtinction from natural nece≈ø≈øity or impo≈ø≈øibility, nothing more is intended than to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øs, on the one hand, the degree of <hi>probability,</hi> or at mo≈øt <hi>moral certainty,</hi> that ≈øuch events will take place: Or, on the other hand, the <hi>difficulty</hi> that is in the way, and the <hi>moral evidence</hi> that they will not become effect. 'Tis not meant that there is any proper nece≈ø≈øity in the ca≈øe. When we ≈øay, We <hi>mu≈øt</hi> do or forbear ≈øuch things‚Äîwe <hi>cannot</hi> but do or forbear them‚Äîwe are <hi>nece≈ø≈øitated</hi> to do or forbear them, we would only expre≈øs the ≈øtrength of obligation upon us, or the ≈øtrong inducements we are under, in our pre≈øent ≈øituation and circum≈øtances, to do or omit them, When we ≈øay of a man of approved veracity and fidelity, that he <hi>cannot</hi> lie, or violate his tru≈øt and engagements, we mean that we have moral certainty he will ≈øpeak the truth, and be faithful to his promi≈øes, to the tru≈øt repo≈øed in him‚Äîthat we have the highe≈øt rea≈øon to think ≈øo, and no ≈øu≈øpicion to the contrary; Not ≈øuppo≈øing but it may be barely <hi>po≈ø≈øible,</hi> however improbable, that he may prove fal≈øe and unfaithful. (For ≈øuch men ≈øometimes act un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of their general character, to the great ≈øurprize of their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance.) When it is ≈øaid of tho≈øe who have been long accu≈øtomed to do evil, that they <hi>cannot</hi> learn to do well, by this is only ≈øignified the extreme difficulty of their reforming; the great improbability of it. We ≈øometimes ≈øay, it is next to impo≈ø≈øible ≈øuch ≈øhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, and find their recovery in ≈øcripture re≈øembled to a natural impo≈ø≈øibility. (Jer. XIII. 23.) The meaning is not, that there is any ≈øtrict nece≈ø≈øity of their per≈øi≈øting in ≈øin. There have been in≈øtances of ≈øuch per≈øons reclaimed, and there may be again, great as their dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is. Therefore we cannot ≈øay, 'tis ab≈øolutely certain others of this character will never be reduced; much le≈øs that there is an ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity of their continuing unreformed. The ≈øeveral in≈øtances pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Mr. Edwards (P. 34.) will all apply again≈øt him≈øelf.

"moral nece≈ø≈øity is as <hi>ab≈øolute</hi> as natural." But let us more particularly attend to his own explanation of the di≈øtinction between natural and moral nece≈ø≈øity.</p>
            <p>"By <hi>natural nece≈ø≈øity,</hi> as applied to men, I mean," ≈øaith he, <q>≈øuch nece≈ø≈øity as men are under through the force of natural cau≈øes; as di≈øtingui≈øhed from what are called moral cau≈øes, ≈øuch as habits and di≈øpo≈øitions of the heart, and moral motives and inducements. By <hi>moral nece≈ø≈øity</hi> is meant that nece≈ø≈øity of connection and con≈øequence, which ari≈øeth from the ≈øtrength of ≈øuch moral cau≈øes as the ≈øtrength of inclination, or motives, and the connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion which there is in many ca≈øes between the≈øe, and ≈øuch certain volitions and actions.</q> (P. 29.) To pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any mi≈øtake of his meaning, he gives us notice of the≈øe three things. Fir≈øt, that moral nece≈ø≈øity may be as ab≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:012746_0042_0F8BEDACFA205730"/>
as natural nece≈ø≈øity. Secondly, That moral events are owing to the nature of things. Thirdly, that nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, as applied by him to moral ≈øubjects, is not u≈øed accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the original de≈øign and meaning of the word.</p>
            <p>Here we have occa≈øion to apply Mr. Edwards's own words, P. 287. <q>'Tis very evident, that in the metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øical di≈øtinction between</q> natural and moral nece≈ø≈øity, <q>due care has not been taken to conform language to the nature of things, or to any di≈øtinct clear ideas‚Äîwhich has occa≈øioned inexpre≈ø≈øible difficulty, contention, error and confu≈øion.</q> (P. 279.) <q>Tho≈øe are a precarious ≈øort of demon≈øtrations, which men build on the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing they arbitrarily affix to a word; e≈øpecially when that meaning is ab≈øtru≈øe, incon≈øi≈øtent, and entirely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øe from the original ≈øen≈øe of the word in common ≈øpeech.</q> We know of no writer that his u≈øed words more <hi>arbitrarily,</hi> and <hi>ab≈øtru≈øely;</hi> or built more <hi>precarious demon≈øtrations</hi> on ≈øuch u≈øe of them. What is offered on the article of nece≈ø≈øity ≈øeems peculiarly liable to this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.</p>
            <p>To recur to the di≈øtinction of natural and moral nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity. The great jumble and confu≈øion of ideas in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore≈øaid explanation is to be regretted.</p>
            <p>By "nece≈ø≈øity of connection and con≈øequence" we ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain no idea of moral nece≈ø≈øity as di≈øtinct from natural. To ≈øay in explanation hereof, that the volitions of moral agents are connected immediately or mediately with what is nece≈ø≈øary in its own nature, and ≈øo are nece≈ø≈øary by a nece≈ø≈øity of con≈øequence, (P. 25; 29.) is ≈øo far from help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing us to di≈øtingui≈øh moral nece≈ø≈øity from natural, that the attempt to explain doth but confound the di≈øtinction, which is ≈øuppo≈øed to be of much importance. According to this explanation, moral actions are effects of natural nece≈ø≈øity, when traced up to their true cau≈øe. For ≈øaith Mr. Edwards, <q>Things which are <hi>perfectly connected</hi> with other things that are nece≈ø≈øary [in their own nature] are <hi>them≈øelves</hi> nece≈ø≈øary, by a nece≈ø≈øity of con≈øequence.</q> The volitions of accountable creatures not being in their own nature nece≈ø≈øary, are ≈øo ina≈ømuch as they are perfectly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected with, and certainly follow from, the divine exi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence

and perfections. As this is to a≈ø≈øert, that God is the original moral cau≈øe of ≈øin, ≈øo it is finally to a≈ø≈øert that ≈øin aro≈øe from a nece≈ø≈øity in the nature of things. Do we yet perceive any difference between natural and moral nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, on this ≈øtate of the matter? The divine exi≈øtence is eternal, and therefore ab≈øolutely nece≈ø≈øary in its own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.<note n="*" place="bottom">We enquire not into the <hi>cau≈øe</hi> of the divine exi≈øtence, which al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together ≈øurpa≈ø≈øeth our perception. Vid. Examination, Part II. Sect. 1.</note> The volitions of creatures are perfectly connected with the divine exi≈øtence and conduct. And are they not then nece≈ø≈øary with a natural nece≈ø≈øity.</p>
            <p>Further, What doth Mr. Edwards mean by a <hi>moral</hi> cau≈øe? <note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">
                  <p>"We give in general the name of moral cau≈øe of an action to the <hi>per≈øon</hi> that produced it, either in the whole or part, by a determination of his will; whether he executes it him≈øelf phy≈øically and immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ≈øo as to be the author thereof; or whether he procures it by the act of ≈øome other per≈øon, and becomes thereby it's cau≈øe."</p>
                  <bibl>Burlamaqui, Vol. I. P. 238.</bibl>
               </note> In the pa≈ø≈øage under pre≈øent examination, and through his book, he blends moral motives and induce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments with moral habits, inclinations and di≈øpo≈øitions, as though they were preci≈øely the ≈øame, and indi≈øcriminately calls them moral cau≈øes. Here are ≈øeveral things unintel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligible.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, The <hi>difference</hi> between a moral di≈øpo≈øition and a moral volition ≈øhould have been pointed out. For moral volitions and actions, upon this ≈øcheme, are immediately connected with moral habits and di≈øpo≈øitions as their moral cau≈øe. Or if there be no difference, then it ≈øhould have been ≈øhewn,</p>
            <p>Secondly, How the ≈øame moral habit, which is a moral volition or act, is al≈øo the moral cau≈øe of <hi>it≈øelf</hi>‚Äîcau≈øe and effect at the ≈øame time, and in regard to the ≈øame thing‚Äî the ≈øubject of its own efficiency. Were this conceivable, ≈øtill,</p>
            <p>Thirdly, How is a moral habit [or motive] <hi>before</hi> and <hi>previous</hi> to it≈øelf? How hath it a <hi>tendency,</hi> by po≈øitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and action, to <hi>move</hi> and <hi>excite</hi> to it≈øelf? How is it the cau≈øe of that <hi>exertion,</hi> which, by ≈øuppo≈øition, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erted before its influence and motion is applied for the purpo≈øe?</p>
            <p>Fourthly, If motives are nothing di≈øtinct from moral habits and inclinations, then they are not <hi>extrin≈øic</hi> cau≈øes of
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:012746_0044_0F8BEDAE7A1078B0"/>
≈øuch inclinations and habits, as Mr. Edwards often ≈øtiles them‚Äîare not the <hi>medium</hi> of producing ≈øuch habits.</p>
            <p>Fifthly, If moral volitions are connected with their moral cau≈øe by a nece≈ø≈øity of <hi>con≈øequence,</hi> then it ≈øeems, the cau≈øe and nece≈ø≈øity are <hi>prior</hi> to the volitions, and that the volitions them≈øelves <hi>follow,</hi> as effects follow their cau≈øes. But how can they be <hi>con≈øequent,</hi> if a moral motive be a moral di≈øpo≈øition, as it is certain a moral di≈øpo≈øition is a moral volition? We would, if po≈ø≈øible, di≈øcover the <hi>peculiar</hi> connection which Mr. Edwards ≈øuppo≈øeth there is between one and the ≈øame thing, ≈øo as to di≈øcern how it is a moral cau≈øe and a moral effect of‚Äîit≈øelf! We cannot ea≈øily apprehend what he means by moral nece≈ø≈øity; or perceive where the difference lies, according to him, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween natural and moral nece≈ø≈øity.</p>
            <p>Further, When Mr. Edwards ≈øaith, that the nature of the connection between moral cau≈øes and effects is the ≈øame as in natural cau≈øes and effects‚Äîthat they differ only as the terms connected are di≈ø≈øimilar, this doth but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tangle the ≈øubject ≈øtill more: For if there be no difference in the nature of the connection; if this be alike indi≈ø≈øolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble in the one as in the other, is not then the nece≈ø≈øity the ≈øame? what proper di≈øtinction is there between natural and moral nece≈ø≈øity? Doth he mean al≈øo to confound na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural cau≈øes and effects as he doth moral? to ≈øay, in like manner, that a natural effect is the natural cau≈øe of it≈øelf? the object of its own influence and action? producer and produced?</p>
            <p>Further, This connection between moral volitions and their moral cau≈øes is ≈øaid to take place <hi>in many ca≈øes.</hi> If it <hi>ever</hi> fails, how is the connection <q>≈øure and perfect‚Äîac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to e≈øtabli≈øhed laws?</q> If the connection may in <hi>any</hi> ca≈øe be broken, there is no nece≈ø≈øity. 'Tis not as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute, as unfru≈øtrable as natural nece≈ø≈øity.</p>
            <p>Further, As nothing except the <hi>divine exi≈øtence and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections</hi> is nece≈ø≈øary in it≈øelf, or in nature; according to Mr. Edwards him≈øelf; when he ≈øaith moral nece≈ø≈øity is as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute and irr≈øi≈øtible as natural, doth he mean that the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral volitions of creatures are as nece≈ø≈øary as the exi≈øtence of God? Apply this to his own doctrine re≈øpecting the
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:012746_0045_0F8BEDAF3A161A18"/>
origin of evil, and either the ab≈øolutene≈øs of moral nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty mu≈øt be given up, or the moral character of the Deity di≈øbelieved. Was it Adam's original bias and di≈øpo≈øition to rebel again≈øt God? If it was, he was created a rebel. And what tho'ts mu≈øt we entertain of the creator, from whom immediately he derived this bias? Can we di≈øtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gui≈øh his being created in ≈øin from natural nece≈ø≈øity? If this was not his original di≈øpo≈øition, but the contrary, then he was far from being under a nece≈ø≈øity of ≈øinning, as ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolute as natural nece≈ø≈øity‚Äîhis fall was <q>not owing to na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture.</q>
            </p>
            <p>Or ≈øuppo≈øe the fir≈øt ≈øinful volition really nece≈ø≈øary in the way Mr. Edwards contends for, what e≈ø≈øential diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence could there be between a nece≈ø≈øity <hi>without</hi> the will, and a nece≈ø≈øity <hi>within</hi> it? Evil di≈øpo≈øitions originally im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted in the creature, or infu≈øed into him afterwards, or proceeding from the want of divine influence and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, cannot render the ≈øubject thereof criminal, nor can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be called evil as relative to him, as may be ≈øhewn in the next ≈øection. To ≈øay in this ca≈øe, <q>'Tis his very nature; he is of a vile natural temper, 'tis as natural for him to act ≈øo as it is to breathe; he can't help ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving the devil,</q> &amp;c. <note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Edwards, p. 304.</note> would be a full excu≈øe, provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded ≈øuch a nature and temper were originally implanted or infu≈øed by the creator, or aro≈øe from the want of his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance. And as the fir≈øt ≈øinful volition was as ab≈øolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly nece≈ø≈øary as any following ones, and the fir≈øt in the ≈øeries determineth all the re≈øt, on Mr. Edwards's plan‚Äîas the nece≈ø≈øity he pleads for is not even pretended to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive from the fall, nor the ≈øin of Adam once mentioned as the ≈øource of it, but took place in his innocent ≈øtate, and was prior to the fall of angels; ≈øo we may well ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve, that in the creature's original ≈øtate a nece≈ø≈øity <hi>in</hi> the will or <hi>without</hi> it mu≈øt amount to the ≈øame thing. In ≈øuch ≈øtate, to ≈øuppo≈øe an indi≈øpo≈øition, or moral inability, or op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition of will to holine≈øs would be to admit as full an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cu≈øe as any inability <hi>extrin≈øic</hi> to the will can be‚Äîit would be a proper natural nece≈ø≈øity‚Äîan original defect of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers or advantages to do what was required.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:012746_0046_0F9090CA068B00C8"/>Might not then the fall of angels and man have been prevented? Mr. Edwards has intimated that it might. If ≈øo, then it is clear, it could not be nece≈ø≈øary with the irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øtible, ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity he pleads for. To ≈øuppo≈øe it was <hi>really</hi> nece≈ø≈øary, though in the lowe≈øt degree, <note n="*" place="bottom">Moral nece≈ø≈øity, Mr. Edwards ≈øuppo≈øeth, admits of degrees.</note> is the ≈øame as to ≈øuppo≈øe it nece≈ø≈øary in the highe≈øt degree, the event being alike ≈øure on either ≈øuppo≈øition. To illu≈øtrate the matter by an in≈øtance from Mr. Edwards. Suppo≈øe a man required to lift a weight of 101 lb. who≈øe natural ≈øtrength is only equal to a weight of 100 lb. he is as really unable to lift 101 as 1000 lb. And it would be as really contrary to rea≈øon to require him to lift one pound beyond his ≈øtrength as nine hundred. Was there a moral inabili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ≈øimilar to this in our fir≈øt parents in their primitive ≈øtate? In this ca≈øe "doing wrong with the <hi>will,</hi>" or <q>from the heart,</q> would be far from being <q>the ≈øum total of the matter,</q> in our e≈øtimation of blame-worthine≈øs. (P. 298, 299.) We naturally a≈øcend to the ≈øource and fountain of this wrong will or heart, and enquire whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the ≈øubject had the nece≈ø≈øary means of willing other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe? If the ≈øtate of his will or heart was originally fixed by nece≈ø≈øity, common ≈øen≈øe at once acquits him of blame. Were angels and our common progenitors thus abandon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God!</p>
            <p>In the fir≈øt ≈øin, there was a want or oppo≈øition of will to what was required by the Creator. Was this want or oppo≈øition of will nece≈ø≈øary before the fir≈øt ≈øin took place? If not, then there was a freedom from moral nece≈ø≈øity at lea≈øt with re≈øpect to the fir≈øt act of ≈øin. Or if the fir≈øt di≈øinclination to, and non-compliance with, duty, was founded in nece≈ø≈øity, who placed the creature under that nece≈ø≈øity? He mu≈øt have had power originally to pre≈øerve his innocence, or the nece≈ø≈øity of his forfeiting it mu≈øt have been a natural nece≈ø≈øity. Which ≈øide ≈øoever Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards's ≈øcheme embraceth, it is ≈øubverted.</p>
            <p>To evince the con≈øi≈øtency of his doctrine of nece≈ø≈øity with the highe≈øt worthine≈øs of prai≈øe and moral e≈øteem, Mr. Edwards takes frequent occa≈øion to ob≈øerve, that God po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øeth the mo≈øt perfect liberty, and is notwith≈øtanding
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:012746_0047_0F9090CB8C613468"/>
nece≈ø≈øarily holy, &amp;c. In the ≈øame view he mentions the nece≈ø≈øity of Chri≈øt's holine≈øs. We grant that God is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øarily holy‚Äîthat Je≈øus Chri≈øt is ≈øo; but ≈øee not how this "clearly and ab≈øolutely determines the controver≈øy,"</p>
            <p>For,</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Mr. Edwards maintains, that the <hi>perfection of the divine under≈øtanding</hi> is the foundation of the immutable rectitude of his will. Now as the moral intellect in crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures is ≈øo very imperfect, there can be no infering the nece≈ø≈øity of their wills from the nece≈ø≈øity of the divine. Mr. Edwards would not ≈øay, that the volitions of holy angels are determined to the right ≈øide in the ≈øame manner as the divine will is determined to holine≈øs. For then their knowledge mu≈øt be perfect as his. Or if, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding the imperfection of their knowledge, their wills always have been, are, and will be as unalterably deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to holine≈øs, then it mu≈øt be in ≈øome <hi>other</hi> way, on ≈øome other foundation, equally ≈øure and ≈øtedfa≈øt, not yet pointed out. Should it be ≈øuppo≈øed further, that they are now confirmed in a ≈øtate of holine≈øs beyond the po≈ø≈øibility of a defection; yet we conjecture that they (as well as other finite beings) have been, in ≈øome part of their dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, upon trial in ≈øuch ≈øen≈øe as implies danger of mi≈øcar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rying. Beings in their ≈øituation once, have actually fallen.</p>
            <p>Secondly, We have no objection to the opinion, that the rectitude of the divine will is nece≈ø≈øary. But why this nece≈ø≈øity ≈øhould be called <hi>moral,</hi> by way of di≈øtinction from <hi>natural,</hi> we ≈øee not. When we di≈øtingui≈øh the moral from the natural perfections of God, we do indeed ≈øuppo≈øe that the latter would be no perfections were it not for the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. At the ≈øame time, there is an evident contradiction in ≈øuppo≈øing a being to exi≈øt, po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of the attributes, which for di≈øtinction's ≈øake are called the natural perfec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of God, without po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øing perfect moral rectitude.</p>
            <p>Holine≈øs, ju≈øtice, goodne≈øs belong to the divine nature as much as power, omni≈øcience, immen≈øity, &amp;c. He is by nece≈ø≈øity <hi>of nature</hi> holy, ju≈øt and good, no le≈øs than he is, by the ≈øame nece≈ø≈øity, eternal, infinite, omnipotent, omni≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient. When it is ≈øaid, God <hi>cannot</hi> do wickedly, this is to be under≈øtood as denoting a ≈øtrict nece≈ø≈øity. Who ever
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:012746_0048_0F9090CC373CEA38"/>
≈øays, 'Tis <hi>morally</hi> impo≈ø≈øible for God to lie? as tho' it were <hi>naturally</hi> po≈ø≈øible. The terms <hi>can, cannot, nece≈ø≈øary, impo≈ø≈øible,</hi> &amp;c. as applied to God, denote no le≈øs a nece≈ø≈øity of <hi>nature</hi> than of <hi>will.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>"If it be the very nature of God to act ju≈øtly and faithfully, ≈øo that he cannot will nor act otherwi≈øe, it may be called, I think, a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural nece≈ø≈øity, ≈øince it ≈øprings from his nature; as well as it may be called a moral one, becau≈øe it is the action of an intelligent and free agent."</p> 
                  <bibl>Dr. Watts.</bibl>
               </note> Admitting this, 'tis not altoge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther proper to apply to the divine moral rectitude the di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of natural and moral nece≈ø≈øity. For to ≈øay that God is holy by the nece≈ø≈øity of his will, is the ≈øame as to ≈øay he is holy by the nece≈ø≈øity of his nature.</p>
            <p>It doth not, however, follow, from the nece≈ø≈øity of the divine moral rectitude above a≈ø≈øerted, that therefore God could have done in no re≈øpect differently from what he hath. In what properly belongs to moral rectitude, we maintain the nece≈ø≈øity of the divine will, ≈øtrictly ≈øpeaking. But did moral rectitude require there ≈øhould be exactly ≈øo many orders of creatures‚Äî≈øuch a certain number of each order‚Äîbrought into exi≈øtence at ≈øuch certain time and place‚Äîendowed with ≈øuch particular powers and properties‚Äîplaced in ≈øuch circum≈øtances? That there ≈øhould be exactly ≈øo many grains of ≈øand, drops of water, particles of light, &amp;c. &amp;c? The ≈øcriptures tell us, that God was able to rai≈øe up children to Abraham from the ≈øtones. If he was able, then he might have done it. For to ≈øay he is able to do what contradicts moral rectitude, is to ≈øay he may deny him≈øelf, which we know he <hi>cannot.</hi> Omnipotence cannot do any thing contradictory to moral perfection. But this is very different from ≈øaying, that God actually doth every thing that is po≈ø≈øible with him.</p>
            <p>"To ≈øay that God has exerted his power or his wi≈ødom, <hi>ad ultimum po≈ø≈øe,</hi> ≈øo that he can proceed no further, is to ≈øay a great deal too much; But we may with rea≈øon a≈ø≈øert, that he has di≈øcovered infinite wi≈ødom and infinite power; or in other words, that none but a being po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of the≈øe perfections in the highe≈øt po≈ø≈øible degree could have crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted this ≈øtupendous univer≈øe." <note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Dr. Eliot's ≈øermon on natural religion, p. 10, 11.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Je≈øus Chri≈øt the righteous is al≈øo holy with the ≈øame nece≈ø≈øity as is above a≈øcribed to God‚Äînot a moral nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty

            <p>Now to ≈øay that the holine≈øs of angels in heaven is, and always was, as infallibly and unalterably nece≈ø≈øary as the holine≈øs of God and Je≈øus Chri≈øt, is to ≈øay they never were capable of ≈øining‚Äîand is to make them equal with God, who chargeth the angels with folly; in who≈øe ≈øight the ≈øtars are not clean. To ≈øay, on the other hand, that the defection of angels which fell was unalterably nece≈ø≈øary, is to ≈øay they never were able to ≈øtand in their primitive ≈øtate; and is to a≈øcribe their ≈øin and de≈øtruction, not to them≈øelves, but to him who is immutably holy, ju≈øt and good.</p>
            <p>There is, indeed, a <hi>qualified</hi> ≈øen≈øe in which confirmed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels and perfected ≈øpirits in heaven may be ≈øaid to be ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly by a nece≈ø≈øity of nature; having pa≈ø≈øed their trial, and being finally e≈øtabli≈øhed in a ≈øtate of moral rectitude‚Äî which admits of endle≈øs improvement. We may ≈øay, 'tis their nature to be holy‚Äîto be like God. Hence it will follow, that apo≈øtate ≈øpirits, and ≈øuch from among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind as have died impenitent, having neglected and abu≈øed the time of their vi≈øitation, are, by a like nece≈ø≈øity, enemies of righteou≈øne≈øs, and cannot but remain ≈øo.

moral inability is like that of tho≈øe who have long grieved and quenched the ≈øpirit, and hereby provoked God to take it from them?</p>
            <p>But whatever moral inability belongs to unregenerate men by nature, and notwith≈øtanding the means and a≈ø≈øi≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of grace, nothing is plainer than this, that Calvini≈øtic divines have ever con≈øidered the inability of mankind to holine≈øs as the natural and judicial con≈øequences of ≈øin.

            <p>In our controver≈øy with Mr. Edwards, there is, indeed, no occa≈øion to examine the impotency of fallen man. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to him, Adam in innocence was morally unable to retain the ≈øpiritual image of God, with which he is ≈øuppo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to have been endowed. (This mu≈øt have been, by the way, a natural as well as moral inability‚Äîan inability ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginal to him, no le≈øs in his under≈øtanding than in his will.) If he had power to have viewed things in a different man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, the ≈øcheme of nece≈ø≈øity is overthrown. His fir≈øt want or oppo≈øition of will to what was required of him was his fir≈øt ≈øin. How came he by this want or oppo≈øition of will? It was not original to him, if he was created with the moral image of God. To the efficient cau≈øe we mu≈øt attribute his fir≈øt indi≈øpo≈øition or oppo≈øition to his duty, whoever or whatever that cau≈øe be. <note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Edwards, p. 103.</note> 'Tis indeed ab≈øurd to ≈øay, that after this oppo≈øition to duty was become effect, he could have annihilated it, or cau≈øed it not to be. But might he have pre≈øerved the ≈øame actual will to wor≈øhip and obey God after the exhibition of ≈øatan's temptation, as before? Did the extancy of this temptation in his mind make or con≈øtitute him a ≈øinner? (No ≈øurely; for our Lord him≈øelf was tempted by the devil, yet without ≈øin.) After the temptation was extant, had he an immediate power to call the motives of religion to view, and re≈øi≈øt the ≈øugge≈øtions of the adver≈øary? If not, how could ≈øin lie at his door? Was his moral inability of his own procuring? or could he remove it?

            <p>MR.

            <p>In the≈øe things we doubt not it may be made to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, that he alike contradicts him≈øelf, and the foundation principles of rea≈øon and religion.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, He contradicts him≈øelf. We ≈øhall take notice on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly of two re≈øpects in which he doth ≈øo. His own illu≈øtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ≈øubject goes upon the ≈øuppo≈øition,</p>

of ≈øomething <hi>negative</hi> on God's part, or follows from the <hi>want</hi> of his influence, and from this <hi>only.</hi> Whereas Mr. Edwards con≈øtantly a≈ø≈øerts, that God is the <hi>determiner, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer,</hi> and <hi>deci≈øive di≈øpo≈øer</hi> of this event. 'Tis not ≈øufficient with him to ≈øay, that God is <q>the permitter, or not a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derer of ≈øin;</q> but he is careful immediately to add, <q>and at the ≈øame time a di≈øpo≈øer of the ≈øtate of events, in ≈øuch a manner, that ≈øin will mo≈øt certainly and infallibly fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low.</q> (P. 3 57, 367.)

Doth not his ordering and di≈øpo≈øing an event, with all the previous circum≈øtances, imply ≈øomething more than <hi>forbearing</hi> to act? even his influence and energy, or active providence therein? Are the <hi>determinations</hi> and <hi>decrees</hi> of God, the <hi>di≈øpo≈øitions</hi> of his providence, nothing <hi>po≈øitive?</hi> Mr. Edwards ≈øaith expre≈øs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, "To <hi>direct, decide,</hi> or <hi>determine</hi> any thing, is to act." (P. 51.) He connects the <hi>active</hi> and <hi>permi≈ø≈øive</hi> providence of God‚Äîmaintains an <hi>efficient</hi> determination of, and <hi>effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious</hi> providence in ≈øin.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Admit the exi≈øtence of ≈øin to be the con≈øequence, not of any po≈øitive influence of the deity, but to follow only from his forbearing to influence and a≈ø≈øi≈øt the creature, in like manner as darkne≈øs and fro≈øt in the night follow upon the <hi>departure</hi> of the ≈øun‚Äîadmit that God is not the <hi>efficient</hi> cau≈øe of ≈øin; it will then follow, that the ≈øinful being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf mu≈øt be this cau≈øe. Now to ≈øay that the perpetrator of wickedne≈øs is the efficient cau≈øe of it, is to e≈øtabli≈øh a power of <hi>≈øelf-determination,</hi> contrary to the principal de≈øign of Mr. Edwards's book. He mu≈øt either maintain the po≈øitive energy and action of the deity in the introduction of ≈øin into the world, or el≈øe admit that it aro≈øe from a cau≈øe in the mind of the ≈øinner‚Äîin other words, that he was ≈øelf-determined. And tho' this would involve his ≈øcheme in the ab≈øurdity he ≈øpeaks of, p. 7. that the will <q>acts and produceth effects upon it≈øelf, and is the object of its own influence and action,</q> yet there is no evading it.

            </p>
            <p>Secondly, His doctrine is repugnant to the fundamental and mo≈øt important principles of rea≈øon and religion. It is a≈øcribing ≈øin as really, and in as obnoxious a ≈øen≈øe, to God, as to affirm, his po≈øitive agency and efficiency herein. Mr. Edwards would have been more con≈øi≈øtent with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf, had he embraced the latter opinion. His ≈øcheme can hang together on no other ≈øuppo≈øition. And on this ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition, the moral perfections and government of God, and revealed religion, mu≈øt be di≈øbelieved.</p>
            <p>But his doctrine re≈øpecting the manner of ≈øin's coming into exi≈øtence ≈øhall be examined ≈øomewhat di≈øtinctly.</p>
            <p>If ≈øin aro≈øe from God's withdrawing his a≈ø≈øi≈øtance and influence, it will then follow that the creature <hi>had origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally</hi> ≈øuch influence and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance as was <hi>≈øufficient to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent</hi> apo≈øtacy. Otherwi≈øe this would not be the con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the <hi>withdraw</hi> of divine influence, but more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the con≈øequence of the <hi>deficiency</hi> of ≈øuch influence. And the ca≈øe of the ≈øun's departure from our horizon would be very impertinently u≈øed to exemplify this event. For ≈øuppo≈øe the creature never had ≈øufficient divine influence and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance to ≈øecure his primitive rectitude, his ≈øtate would have been analogous to primitive darkne≈øs and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal night. And becau≈øe he did not walk in the light of the ≈øun, without having ever enjoy'd its enlivening beams, he is con≈øigned (or obnoxious) to blackne≈øs or darkne≈øs forever.</p>
            <p>If therefore there is any pertinency in the in≈øtance Mr.
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:012746_0058_0F9090D8D1F77108"/>
Edwards brings, the creature once had ≈øuch light, influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance as might have forever ≈øecured his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity. Con≈øequently, the apo≈øtacy might have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented. The only enquiry is, whether it were owing to God, or the creature. Mr. Edwards maintains it was ow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the former. Let us ≈øee whether his opinion be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable with the wi≈ødom, holine≈øs and goodne≈øs, or e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven ju≈øtice of God.</p>
            <p>To ≈øay that the apo≈øtacy was the con≈øequence of God's forbearing to communicate his influence and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, yet that it was a blameable thing in the creature, is not le≈øs glaringly fal≈øe and impious than it would be to ≈øay, that God requires a rational conduct of tho≈øe whom he hath not endowed with the natural under≈øtanding of men‚Äîor that he requires moral exerci≈øes and behaviour of the brute creatures‚Äîor requires a creature to live after he hath taken away the breath of life. Either would be contrary to rea≈øon and ju≈øtice‚Äîto demand more than was given‚Äîcontrary to that fixed rule of divine government, To him that hath ≈øhall be given, and he ≈øhall have abundance.</p>
            <p>Again, we might much more con≈øi≈øtently ≈øuppo≈øe, that God would have put an end to the exi≈øtence of a rational creature, than have continued ≈øuch an one in being and withdrawn his influence, previous to any direct forfeiture on the creatures part. The latter would imply inju≈øtice: But the former might not. Exi≈øtence being a free gift at fir≈øt, the continuance of it would have been ≈øo, had the creature not ≈øinned. The creator might have di≈øcontinued it without doing any wrong, even ≈øuppo≈øing ≈øin had not taken place. But to continue the creature in being, and withhold divine influence from him, in con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of which he is nece≈ø≈øarily plunged into a ≈øtate of ≈øin, mi≈øery and de≈øperation, would be to give and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue being on terms wor≈øe than not to be at all.

Edwards's ≈øcheme?

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Mr. Edwards ≈øaith indeed, "God don't will ≈øin as ≈øin."

But admitting this di≈øtinction, Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards's ≈øcheme will be ≈øtill embarra≈ø≈øed.

If it be, where is the difference between this, and his willing ≈øin, or being <hi>him≈øelf</hi> the ≈øubject of a ≈øinful volition? If he that willeth ≈øin doth not will its ≈øinfulne≈øs, how can ≈øin then exi≈øt?

But when they are ≈øaid under a notion of honoring his name and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by the profe≈ø≈øed friends of religion, we mu≈øt beg leave to think, that the utmo≈øt candor can find no ≈øufficient excu≈øe for tho≈øe who are bold and po≈øitive herein. <hi>Humility</hi> and <hi>mode≈øty</hi> in di≈øqui≈øitions of this kind will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be applauded by the wi≈øe and good; but <hi>a≈ø≈øurance</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> in a≈ø≈øerting, that God is the cau≈øe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducer of moral evil; accompanied with <hi>uncharitablene≈øs</hi> towards tho≈øe who cannot believe ≈øuch doctrine, mu≈øt be very forbiding. <hi>Holy and reverend is his name.</hi> When we ≈øpeak of his coun≈øels and determinations, the ends and rea≈øons of his government, it ≈øhould be with much diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence‚Äîwith jealou≈øy and godly fear, le≈øt we ≈øhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach and di≈øhonor him, who≈øe glory is above the hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens. Coun≈øel may be darkened by multiplying words, and ignorance and temerity manife≈øted rather than know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge and piety. Behold! God is great, and we know him not. How ≈ømall a proportion have we heard of him? Can≈øt thou by ≈øearching find out God! <hi>This,</hi> however, we clearly know, that God cannot do wickedne≈øs, and hath no plea≈øure therein; but delighteth in exerci≈øing judgment, righteou≈øne≈øs and loving-kindne≈øs in the earth.</p>

            <p>Mr. Edwards agrees with the writer of the letters on the origin of evil in rejecting the u≈øual ≈øolution, which derives ≈øin from the abu≈øe of free-will.

'Tis to be la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented, when the friends and public teachers of religion adopt and ≈øet them≈øelves to defend, a ≈øcheme of doctrine which gives countenance to infidelity.

There is rea≈øon to apprehend people may ≈øoon be taught from the pulpit, in ≈øo many words, that almighty God fir≈øt infu≈øed wickedne≈øs into the creature.

≈øo much countenance to this profane, bla≈øphemous tenet. It ≈øeems better not to believe a God, than to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ≈øuch an opinion concerning him. Whether this be not the re≈øult of Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme, we are content the impartial ≈øhould determine.</p>
            <p>We have now offered the rea≈øons of our di≈ø≈øent from Mr. Edwards re≈øpecting the origin of evil. We are fully per≈øuaded it did not, <hi>could</hi> not, come into exi≈øtence in the way he ≈øuppo≈øeth‚ÄîYet <hi>how</hi> it in fact came to pa≈øs, that beings made upright have fallen, we acknowledge is to us incomprehen≈øible‚Äîand apprehend it is ≈øo to any hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man under≈øtanding; not excepting theirs who have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to account for it. There is a ≈øen≈øe in which it is doubtle≈øs true, that ≈øin <q>aro≈øe from the imperfection of the creature;</q> that is, the creature was not made incapable of ≈øining. He was originally endowed with a freedom to holine≈øs or ≈øin: He might have cho≈øen the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer, though eventually he cho≈øe the latter. His felicity or mi≈øery was made to depend on his own election. There was no want of original powers and divine communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in order to his continuance in a ≈øtate of moral recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude. It therefore remains, that moral evil aro≈øe from a <hi>neglect</hi> or <hi>perver≈øion</hi> of the powers and divine communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations he had in innocence. Angels and men might have continued holy; but mi≈øimproved the gifts of God, and thus forfeited his influence and friend≈øhip. So far ≈øeems clear: And this is ≈øufficient to vindicate the providence of God in permitting ≈øin and mi≈øery to enter into the world. How it came to pa≈øs, that liberty was originally abu≈øed, ≈øeems to be a matter of unprofitable ≈øpeculation. To tho≈øe who reject this ≈øolution of the matter, and object, that ≈øin could not ari≈øe from the abu≈øe of liberty, ≈øome farther reply may, however, be made in the ninth ≈øection.</p>
            <p>N. B. In our examination of Mr. Edwards, (p. 64.) it was <hi>incidentally</hi> noted from him, that "God deci≈øively orders all the volitions of moral agents by a po≈øitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence"‚Äîhe adds in the place refered to, "or permi≈ø≈øion." We tru≈øt it has been fully ≈øhewn, that he intends an <hi>effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> permi≈ø≈øion‚Äîto "decide, determine, direct, is to <hi>act,</hi>"

as he ≈øaith him≈øelf.

And though we ≈øee not the lea≈øt room for it, and have no doubt but what he has ≈øaid clearly <hi>implies</hi> a po≈øitive influence of the Deity in ≈øin; yet on revi≈øing the afore≈øaid quotation we find he meant not to <hi>expre≈øs</hi> it. We readily take this opportunity to correct the unde≈øigned mi≈ørepre≈øentation, and wi≈øh we could ≈øay his doctrine doth not contain the thing, which was not meant to be explicitly affirmed. Some of the advocates for his ≈øcheme maintain a po≈øitive influence of the Deity in ≈øinful volitions, and ≈øay it was his real opinion, that God is the <hi>efficient</hi> cau≈øe of ≈øin.</p>

            <head>SECTION V. On the connection between the nature and cau≈øe of volition.</head>
            <p>IT is a favourite di≈øtinction with Mr. Edwards, that <q>the e≈ø≈øence of vertue and vice lies in the <hi>nature</hi> of volition, not in the <hi>cau≈øe.</hi>
               </q> We before took ≈øome ≈ølight notice of the futility of this di≈øtinction. We knew, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, that the con≈øi≈øtency of Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended not a little on the propriety of di≈øtingui≈øhing the nature of moral actions from their cau≈øe: But had we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øented ≈øuch a di≈øtinction as really important, <hi>upon his plan,</hi> po≈ø≈øibly it might have been e≈øteem'd invidious. However, we are <hi>now</hi> con≈øtrained to ≈øay, ≈øuch a repre≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation wou'd have been the exact truth. And though we ≈øtill think the di≈øtinction futile and eva≈øive, yet we have a rea≈øon, which we had not when we wrote before, for giving this matter a particular con≈øideration. Our having been publickly called upon (not in very obliging terms <note n="*" place="bottom">E≈ø≈øay on moral agency, part I. ≈øect. 4.</note>) to point out the weakne≈øs of this di≈øtinction, will excu≈øe us with the reader, ≈øhou'd he think more notice is now taken of it, than it really de≈øerves.</p>
            <p>We ≈øhall fir≈øt examine the merits of this di≈øtinction‚Äî and then remind the reader of the importance of it <hi>on Mr. Edwards's plan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Of the <hi>merits</hi> of it. To ≈øay the <hi>e≈ø≈øence</hi> of virtue and vice lies in their <hi>nature,</hi> is only ≈øaying, that the nature of them con≈øi≈øts in their nature. Or the propo≈øition might be tran≈øpo≈øed thus: The <hi>nature</hi> of virtue and vice lies in their <hi>e≈ø≈øence.</hi> The word nature needs explaining as much as the word e≈ø≈øence. To u≈øe the former as a definition or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation of the latter, wou'd not be le≈øs trifling than to attempt to explain the term <hi>nece≈ø≈øary,</hi> by the words <hi>mu≈øt, can, cannot,</hi> of which Mr. Edwards takes notice. (P. 18.) We don't advance one ≈øtep in our under≈øtanding of the ≈øubject by ≈øuch explanations. Shou'd any one a≈øk, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in doth the e≈ø≈øence of virtue and vice con≈øi≈øt? and receive
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:012746_0072_0F9090E9B388DF00"/>
for an≈øwer, It con≈øi≈øts in it's nature‚Äîwou'd he think the an≈øwer le≈øs impertinent, or be le≈øs di≈øpo≈øed to laugh at him that offers it, than if upon a≈øking an explanation of the word nece≈ø≈øity, he ≈øhou'd be an≈øwered, that which is nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary, mu≈øt and cannot but be?</p>
            <p>We de≈øire no logical proof that the nature of virtue and vice lie in the nature of a virtuous or vicious di≈øpo≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. We allow that ≈øuch a di≈øpo≈øition is <hi>what it is;</hi> and think there was no occa≈øion to fill the page with proofs of this ≈øort. For who is fool enough to di≈øpute the thing! But doth this ≈øhow us what <hi>con≈øtitutes</hi> the nature of virtue and vice? what it is that <hi>makes</hi> any particular action or di≈øpo≈øition virtuous or vicious? Or doth it follow, from admitting that <q>the nature of vertue and vice lies in their nature,</q> that therefore their nature is <hi>≈øeperable</hi> from their <hi>cau≈øe?</hi> or that one can be judged of <hi>detach'd</hi> from the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther? Were vertue and vice, as effects in the natural world, produc'd by the efficiency of ≈øome cau≈øe extrin≈øic to the ≈øubject, and in which he is but a pa≈ø≈øive recipient, then, indeed, we might detach their cau≈øe from their nature. But this is beging the que≈øtion. It ≈øtill remains to be proved, that vertue and vice in rational agents are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of a cau≈øe extrin≈øic to them≈øelves.</p>
            <p>This di≈øtinction of Mr. Edwards's is, therefore, ≈øubtil and eva≈øive, as it carries in it an intimation, that his op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponents deny the e≈ø≈øence of volition to lie in it's nature, and maintain it lies in it's cau≈øe by way of di≈øtinction from it's nature. But when or where have they affirm'd the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or deny'd the former? Again, this di≈øtinction is eva≈øive, ina≈ømuch as it takes for granted, that if the e≈ø≈øence of voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lies in it's nature, then the nature of volition may be ≈øeperated from the cau≈øe‚Äîwhich con≈øequence is by no means admitted. It is eva≈øive al≈øo, as it takes for granted that the cau≈øe of moral volitions is not in the mind of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral agents. For if it be indeed true, that the cau≈øe of ≈øuch volition is in the mind or agent willing, we pre≈øume, in this ca≈øe, no one wou'd attempt to disjoin the cau≈øe and nature of volition. Lea≈øt of all could Mr. Edwards.</p>
            <p>To treat of moral cau≈øes and effects in the ≈øame manner as a philo≈øopher wou'd di≈øcour≈øe on natural cau≈øes, is a
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:012746_0073_0F9090EA412D29A8"/>
method of handling moral ≈øubjects altogether improper, but much u≈øed by Mr. Edwards‚ÄîWith what advantage to his own ≈øcheme? For in <hi>this</hi> way of rea≈øoning we a≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cend from the effect to the cau≈øe. <q>The cau≈øe mu≈øt be proportionable and agreable to the effect, nor can there be more in the effect than in the cau≈øe,</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 62.</note> as Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards hath ob≈øerved. Admit then that vertue and vice in moral and accountable creatures are the production of a cau≈øe extrin≈øic to their own minds, have we not ≈øhewn, that the cau≈øe which produceth wickedne≈øs, is wicked? The ≈øubject in whom vice is thus produced cannot be vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious at all. Or to ≈øpeak more properly, the ≈øuppo≈øition that a creature can, in this way, be the ≈øubject of a vicious di≈øpo≈øition, is a palpable ab≈øurdity. A di≈øpo≈øition thus produced cannot partake of the nature of vice, viewed in relation to the <hi>≈øubject,</hi> however it doth as view'd in relation to the <hi>cau≈øe</hi> and <hi>producer</hi> of it. If then this cau≈øe be God, (as on Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme we have ≈øhewn it mu≈øt be) who wou'd not ≈øhudder at the con≈øequence!</p>
            <p>That the nature of moral evil cannot be detached from it's efficient cau≈øe, we pre≈øume will clearly appear from ≈øtating a few ca≈øes. And ≈øince it is the <hi>origin</hi> of evil we are ultimately enquiring after, the≈øe ca≈øes ≈øhall be ≈øtated upon the different ≈øchemes of accounting for the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of moral evil, which have been embraced by divines and philo≈øophers. The fir≈øt ≈øhall be Mr. Edwards's own.</p>
            <p>Suppo≈øe then the exi≈øtence of ≈øin aro≈øe from the <hi>imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> properly belonging to a creature, <hi>as ≈øuch,</hi> and from God's withholding or <hi>withdrawing</hi> his grace. On this plan can the fir≈øt ≈øin of angels and man be disjoined from the cau≈øe? If the creature had not original abilities and communications from God adequate to the duty requir'd of him; or if the≈øe abilities and communications were ≈øu≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended or withdrawn before any forfeiture was incur'd; cou'd the moral evil of that di≈øpo≈øition, which the fir≈øt ≈øin involved, be attributed to the ≈øubject of it, any more than if he had been created with it? Or any more than if it had been infu≈øed by the po≈øitive influence of ≈øome other agent? Mr. Edwards wou'd admit, that if a moral agent was
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:012746_0074_0F9090EB00396B38"/>
"fir≈øt made with a fountain of evil in his heart," or had a vicious di≈øpo≈øition afterwards produced in him by the efficiency of the Deity, this wou'd be to make God the actor and doer of wickedne≈øs. Now hath it not been ≈øhewn, that his own ≈øcheme runs up to this? Doth it not, therefore, follow, even on his own doctrine, in the ca≈øe we are now ≈øuppo≈øing that the obliquity of ≈øin cannot be ≈øeperated from the cau≈øe‚Äîthough (≈øhocking to mention!) he makes the Deity him≈øelf that cau≈øe? Doth this ≈øcheme give us an idea of the moral governor of the world at all different from what the ≈øcriptures give us of the arbitrary prince of Egypt in the time of Mo≈øes, who demanded of the I≈øraelites the u≈øual tale of brick, after he deny'd them ≈øtraw? Or of tho≈øe who <hi>bound heavy burthens, and grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vous to be born, and laid them on mens ≈øhoulders, but them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves wou'd not move them with one of their fingers?</hi> Should a ma≈øter require of his ≈øervant ≈øuch a ta≈øk as he cou'd well perform, having proper tools to work with‚Äîbut ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver allow him ≈øuch tools, or for no fault of the ≈øervant's take them from him, ≈øo that he <hi>nece≈ø≈øarily</hi> fails of the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his ta≈øk: Wou'd any body pronounce ≈øuch ≈øervant wicked and ≈ølothful‚Äîaccu≈øe him of idlene≈øs and want of re≈øpect to his ma≈øter? Wou'd not every one pity him as having an hard, and unrea≈øonable ma≈øter, and attribute all the blame to the latter for denying his ≈øervant what was requi≈øite to his performing the ta≈øk required? But is there ≈øuch unrighteou≈øne≈øs with God? There are, indeed, but a very few divines of eminence, if any, who account for the exi≈øtence of ≈øin in this way which Mr. Edwards doth.</p>
            <p>Suppo≈øe in the next place, that the <hi>po≈øitive agency and efficiency</hi> of God was the cau≈øe of ≈øin's fir≈øt enterance into the world. Can we disjoin the nature of ≈øin from the cau≈øe, in this ca≈øe, and in this ≈øuppo≈øition? Wou'd not this be to make the creature an≈øwerable for the act of God? Are moral agents only the ≈øubjects of certain effects from divine agency? Wherein then do they differ from ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chines? And if there is no material difference, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øts the moral evil of any di≈øpo≈øitions in them? But what an horrid impeachment of the mo≈øt High doth this doctrine
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:012746_0075_0F90913BF5778BB8"/>
contain? This is, indeed, the clear con≈øequence of Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme, though he cho≈øe not to affirm it in words. 'Tis more directly to arraign the perfections and government of almighty God: And hence many, who have thought favourably of Mr. Edwards's doctrine, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject this with pious indignation; and did they ≈øuppo≈øe his doctrine was reducible to ≈øuch a con≈øequence, wou'd im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately give it up. But as this a≈øcription of the fir≈øt ≈øin, of all ≈øin, to the influence, energy, agency or efficiency of God, differs nothing e≈ø≈øentially from the next ca≈øe we ≈øhall ≈øtate, we will proceed directly to</p>
            <p>Suppo≈øe moral agents <hi>created</hi> with vicious di≈øpo≈øitions‚ÄîSuppo≈øe a creature formed with the temper of Lucifer‚Äî≈øuppo≈øe he him≈øelf had been created with his pre≈øent tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per.

But cou'd it be ≈øo e≈øteem'd ≈øeperate from the <hi>cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating cau≈øe?</hi> Wou'd it ≈øatisfy any rational man to be told in this ca≈øe, that the <hi>having</hi> ≈øuch a di≈øpo≈øition argu'd the high criminality of the ≈øubject of it, without our being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliged <q>at all to con≈øider <hi>how he came to have it</hi>‚Äîthat let him come by it how he will, he is fully and perfectly free in exerci≈øing of it, and therefore de≈øerving of blame and puni≈øhment.</q> Wou'd not this be to make the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture culpable for the con≈øtitution and temper he receiv'd immediately from the forming hands of the Creator? Might we not as ju≈øtly ≈øuppo≈øe it, a culpable thing in any human being that he is not formed with the capacity of Gabriel? or in ideots, that they have not natural under≈øtanding? or in brutes, that they are not endowed with rea≈øon? Can the thing formed be an≈øwerable for the act of the former of it? What is properly God's con≈øtitution cannot be the ≈øin of the creature. Con≈øequently, in the ca≈øe now put, the <hi>having</hi> the malignant di≈øpo≈øition ≈øuppo≈øed, would not infer criminality in the ≈øubject, however dete≈øtable ≈øuch di≈øpo≈øition is in it≈øelf: But the criminality, if any there be, mu≈øt be a≈øcribed to the immediate <hi>author and efficient</hi> of it‚Äîthat is, to the creating <hi>cau≈øe.</hi> Nor is the ≈øuppo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a creature made at fir≈øt with ≈øuch a di≈øpo≈øition ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terially different from Mr. Edwards's opinion concerning the introduction of ≈øin, view'd in it's natural con≈øequence; as we tru≈øt hath already been proved.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="79" facs="unknown:012746_0076_0F90913FACC83BC0"/>Whether, therefore, we ≈øuppo≈øe that ≈øin aro≈øe from the want or withdraw of divine influence and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, or from divine agency and efficiency, or that creatures were made wicked at fir≈øt, the nature of ≈øin cannot be ≈øeperated from it's cau≈øe. Now except the≈øe opinions concerning the origin of evil, there has been no other that de≈øerves to be mentioned but that maintain'd by the generality of morali≈øts and divines, that it aro≈øe from the abu≈øe of free-will‚Äîin other words, from a cau≈øe in moral agents them≈øelves.</p>
            <p>Before we di≈ømi≈øs the in≈øtances above adduced, we wou'd ≈øubjoin this further ob≈øervation, that if <hi>that</hi> energy be an <hi>holy</hi> energy, which angels and ≈øaints are the ≈øubjects of, then that is a <hi>≈øinful</hi> energy, which devils and wicked men are the ≈øubjects of, or <hi>thro' which</hi> their wills are inclined and determined to vice‚ÄîThat if one moral agent (whether creature or creator) is ≈øuppo≈øed to be the po≈øitive cau≈øe of ≈øin in another, ≈øo much ≈øin as is to be attributed to the efficiency of the former, is to be taken from the crimina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of the latter, and ≈øet to the account of the cau≈øe and producer of it. <note n="*" place="bottom">Quod e≈øt cau≈øa cau≈øae, e≈øt etiam cau≈øa cau≈øati.</note>
            </p>
            <p>We go on to ob≈øerve, that as moral agency involves accountablene≈øs to a moral governor, ≈øo the laws of God have re≈øpect to the <hi>inward</hi> and <hi>outward</hi> man. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire not only ≈øuch inward principles and affections as corre≈øpond to his perfections and gifts to us, and the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we ≈øtand in to our fellow-creatures; but al≈øo exter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal acts of devotion, ju≈øtice, charity, ≈øelf-government. The matter and ≈øub≈øtance of morality and religion are as much the ≈øubject of command, as the internal principles and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of heart, which ≈øhou'd regulate and influence to 'em. Now the nature of an external action is the ≈øame, whether perform'd by a good or bad man. The prayers and alms of a Phari≈øee, in them≈øelves con≈øidered, or as to the matter of them, are as commendable as tho≈øe of the mo≈øt approved Chri≈øtians. Mr. Edwards in≈øi≈øts, that moral good or evil lies in the ≈øtate and di≈øpo≈øition of the mind, and allows of no vertue or vice in external actions, detach'd from their cau≈øe‚Äîthe principles they proceed from, the ends aim'd at. But why are <hi>internal exerci≈øes</hi> then disjoined from their cau≈øe? It is as evident a truth, that <hi>material actions</hi> are good
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:012746_0077_0F90914128E60820"/>
or bad in their own nature, as that the inward principles and affections are ≈øo. External acts are what they are in their own nature, not depending on the ≈øentiments and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litions of the agent. Though in a <hi>relative</hi> view and e≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation they vary, according to the temper, circum≈øtances and advantages of the agent; yet their nature is unaltera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Men's doing things in their own nature right, with an evil intent; or doing things in their own nature very evil, meaning to do God ≈øervice, doth not alter the nature of the things done. Therefore let us connect both internal exerci≈øes and external actions with their cau≈øes, or neither.</p>
            <p>Again, The ≈øame ≈øin may be very differently <hi>aggravated</hi> in different per≈øons, or in the ≈øame per≈øon at different times. But any ≈øin is in it's own nature the ≈øame, by what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever moral agent committed, or however circum≈øtanced. The preci≈øe definition of ≈øin is A NOMIA‚Äîi. e. without law, or a non-conformity to law. But to determine the degree of guilt in regard to any particular ≈øin, be≈øides the general con≈øideration of the <hi>nature</hi> of the vicious affection or act, the <hi>advantages, opportunities</hi> and <hi>circum≈øtances</hi> of the tran≈øgre≈ø≈øor mu≈øt al≈øo come into con≈øideration. Moral writers have ever kept up this di≈øtinction. Be≈øides maintain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that ≈øome crimes are more heinous than others view'd in their own nature, they have al≈øo maintain'd, that <q>≈øome are more heinous than others <hi>by rea≈øon of ≈øeveral aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations.</hi>
               </q> The ≈øame ≈øin admits of a variety of circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances, which either aggravate or extenuate the guilt of it: The≈øe di≈øtinctions are carefully pre≈øerved in the ≈øacred writings. Now the particular <hi>aggravation</hi> and <hi>circum≈øtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces</hi> of crimes are as different from their <hi>nature,</hi> as one ≈øin is different from another‚Äî(as different as bla≈øphemy is from ≈øome idle word men may ≈øpeak) and therefore ought to come under a ≈øeperate con≈øideration. But Mr. Edwards's doctrine precludes this plain and important di≈øtinction. For if the ≈øeperate con≈øideration of the nature of any vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous volition in it≈øelf be all that is nece≈ø≈øary to determine the matter of criminality, then the fame crime mu≈øt be e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually heinous in every per≈øon that commits it, and in the ≈øame per≈øon at all times. Difference of circum≈øtances can have no weight, as they do not belong to the nature of any particular vice‚Äîthey only make a <hi>gradual,</hi> not a <hi>≈øpecific</hi> dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference.
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:012746_0078_0F90914141D986A8"/>
But the former, it ≈øeems, is of no e≈øtimation. In other words, there is nothing that can either heighten or extenuate the <hi>≈øame</hi> tran≈øgre≈ø≈øion. <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>Suppo≈øe the wills of moral agents are derived from the author of nature, (which by implication was Mr. Edwards's doctrine) and we might apply to the general ≈øubject of this ≈øection ≈øuch in≈øtances as the following. A good man is, by the act of divine providence; reduced to a ≈øtate of in≈øanity‚Äîin con≈øequence of which he is full of the mo≈øt implacable hatred, malice and malignity again≈øt his neare≈øt kindred and be≈øt friends‚Äîyea, bla≈øphemeth his Maker. This di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition is in it's own nature exceeding vile. But is it to be ≈øo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øidered in him? It is, on Mr. Edwards's principles. His <hi>having</hi> and <hi>indulging</hi> the aforementioned malignity of temper, his <hi>voluntarily</hi> uttering bla≈øphemy, are enough to prove him a malignant per≈øon, and a bla≈øphmer, without con≈øidering at all <hi>how he came</hi> by ≈øuch a di≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition‚Äîwhether it proceeded from a cau≈øe extrin≈øic or intrin≈øic. For the madman may proceed as <hi>acliberately, voluntarily</hi> and <hi>de≈øignedly</hi> in the≈øe things, as one who hath the u≈øe of rea≈øon. In the abovenamed in≈øtances "he doth wrong, and doth ≈øo from his heart." And what more is wanting to con≈øtitute him a mo≈øt vile and abandon'd ≈øinner? nothing‚Äîexcept that his ≈øentiments and di≈øpo≈øition are not under his own command, during the dolirium. His will is, indeed fully in the≈øe things‚ÄîHis internal exerci≈øes are voluntary‚Äîhis external actions are ≈øpontaneous exertions‚Äîhe acts lei≈øurely, according to the pre≈øent di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øition of his heart‚Äîhe is under no other nece≈ø≈øity than what is his will's pre≈øent propen≈øity. But then he is incapable of directing and governing his own volitions and actions‚Äîtherefore not the cau≈øe of them‚Äîtherefore not blameable</p>
                  <p>On the ≈øame principle, that agents are blameable for any particular di≈øpo≈øition interwoven with their original frame, we might argue, that the brute-creatures are vicious. The fiercene≈øs of the tyger, the ravening di≈øpo≈øition of the bear and wolf, the venom of the ≈øerpent, might be adduced as examples of a di≈øpo≈øition mo≈øt odious in it's own nature: There is no oppo≈øition in their wills to it‚Äîthey exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ci≈øe it freely‚Äî'tis their nature.</p>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>The foregoing ob≈øervations may be ≈øufficient to ≈øhew, that commendation or blame is not to be ≈øeperated from the cau≈øe of a virtuous or vicious di≈øpo≈øition, and to expo≈øe the weakne≈øs of that di≈øtinction of Mr. Edwards's, on which we have been remarking. It is at lea≈øt true with re≈øpect to the origin of evil, that it's nature cannot be ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perated from it's cau≈øe, nor even in idea conceived to be ≈øo.</p>
            <p>Having examined the merits of the di≈øtinction it≈øelf, we promi≈øed, in the next place, to remind the reader, that however futile and eva≈øive it really is, yet on Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards's <hi>plan,</hi> and <hi>in his</hi> view, it was of much <hi>importance.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The ≈øen≈øe he had of it's importance appears from what he has wrote on this point‚Äîparticularly Part IV. Sect. 1.
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:012746_0079_0F9091426AA08190"/>
Nor did he mi≈ø-judge, provided this fundamental principle in his ≈øcheme be true, that moral agents do not originate, in any ca≈øe, their own actions‚Äîin other words, provided the cau≈øe of their actions be not in them≈øelves. For on this principle, one or other of the≈øe things mu≈øt follow‚Äîeither that vertue or vice is not predicable of moral agents, or that the e≈ø≈øence of them depends not on their cau≈øe. The fir≈øt Mr. Edwards wou'd by no means admit; the other he ≈øaw was a plain con≈øequence of his principles. He therefore ≈øet him≈øelf to defend it as well as he could, that he might exempt the Deity from the charge of being criminal, while, by ≈øuppo≈øition, he originates the volitions of his intelligent creatures.</p>
            <p>Hence appears the occa≈øion Mr. Edwards had to ≈øepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate the nature of vertue and vice from their cau≈øe. This is very much a turning point in the controver≈øy on liberty and nece≈ø≈øity, as he hath ≈øtated it. Whether the di≈øtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion can be vindicated as ju≈øt and proper, we leave the reader to judge. If it cannot, one or other of the≈øe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequences mu≈øt follow‚Äîeither fir≈øt, that there is no ≈øin in the world‚Äîor ≈øecondly, that God him≈øelf is the only cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal being‚Äîor thirdly, that the cau≈øe of ≈øin is in the mind of the ≈øinner. Either of the three ≈øubverts Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards's ≈øcheme. The la≈øt is the only eligible opinion.</p>
            <p>Mr. Edwards's ≈øubject naturally led him to be explicit on this que≈øtion, Whether God or the creature be the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cau≈øe of moral evil? It mu≈øt have been full in his view while writing every part of his book. But we don't recollect that he has once ≈øaid, or ≈øo much as hinted, that the creature is the efficient cau≈øe of ≈øin; though he hath ≈øaid many things which imply that God is the efficient. Whether he declined being explicit from a conviction, that though his ≈øcheme made God the cau≈øe of moral tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pitude, the minds of Chri≈øtians were not yet prepared to receive this a≈øtoni≈øhing doctrine, we ≈øhall not ≈øay. It is of va≈øt importance, who is the cau≈øe of ≈øin. We could wi≈øh Mr. Edwards had not evaded a direct an≈øwer to a que≈øtion, which his ≈øubject, in every part of it, required him to an≈øwer in <hi>clear</hi> and <hi>determinate</hi> language.</p>

For thus only can we be ≈øaved from the wages of ≈øin, and become the ≈øubjects of that grace which reigneth through righteou≈øne≈øs unto eternal life, by Je≈øus Chri≈øt our Lord.</p>
            <p>The que≈øtion re≈øpecting the rea≈øons of the divine permi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion of ≈øin, being u≈øele≈øs and impertinent at lea≈øt, if not pre≈øumptuous, we would only take occa≈øion to ob≈øerve, that "it is the inevitable re≈øult of the nature and condition of created free agents, that they may po≈ø≈øibly err, and act contrary to right; and the placing them in ≈øuch a po≈ø≈øibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity is by no means to be imputed to any deficiency of wi≈ødom and goodne≈øs in God. For example, ≈øuch a crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture as man, compounded of fle≈øh and ≈øpirit, mu≈øt have a variety of affections; ≈øome higher, and ≈øome lower; ≈øome which determine him to pur≈øue the proper perfection of his ≈øuperior faculties as the chief end of his being, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers which attach him to the inferior part of his con≈øti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; which mu≈øt al≈øo be pre≈øerved by his care, during the time appointed for his ≈øub≈øi≈øtence.

In other words, if the divine perfections required that ≈øin ≈øhould be ab≈øolutely prevented, or not at all per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, they required that ≈øuch a creature as man in a ≈øtate of probation, ≈øhould not be created: Which ≈øcarcely any con≈øiderate per≈øon will have the hardine≈øs to affirm." <note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">Abernethy.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. Edwards, it will be remembered, proceeds upon this ≈øuppo≈øition, that the infinite creator, before the world was, having in contemplation all po≈ø≈øible ≈øy≈øtems, gave the preference to one including moral evil, as be≈øt calculated to manife≈øt his perfections. Hence he affirms it to be
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:012746_0082_0F9091444182F298"/>
part of God's own infinite ≈øcheme of things to <hi>chu≈øe</hi> what he <hi>hates,</hi> and what is in it≈øelf, as man's act, di≈øagreable to his heart. (p. 380.) He accordingly in≈øtructs us to view the world, with all the wickedne≈øs that ever was, is, or will be in it, as the projection, ordination and production of that glorious being, who hath not plea≈øure in wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, with whom evil ≈øhall not dwell. Nothing has ever taken place but in pro≈øecution of his original plan: Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evil is a nece≈ø≈øary means through which he effects his de≈øigns: and (it is intimated p. 163,) hath not "mar'd his ≈øy≈øtem,"‚Äînor indeed can this be ≈øuppo≈øed, if ≈øin is ≈øo e≈ø≈øential and material "a part of his infinite ≈øcheme of things."</p>
            <p>Now were it admitted, that moral evil is for the be≈øt, as Mr. Edwards declares <hi>he is certain it is;</hi> this would by no means be a bottom broad enough to ≈øupport his doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine; that it came into exi≈øtence through the divine de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination and deci≈øive di≈øpo≈øal. For if he "di≈øpo≈øeth the mind to" moral evil, then he "<hi>cau≈øeth</hi> the mind to be di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to, and to will" it; "and that is the ≈øame thing as to be the <hi>cau≈øe</hi> of" moral evil (p. 136.) Again, Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards in≈øi≈øts, that the <hi>determiner</hi> of volition is the <hi>cau≈øe</hi> of it. So that to ≈øay (as he does through his whole book) that God determineth every volition of moral agents from their fir≈øt exi≈øtence; is to ≈øay, he is the cau≈øe of every ≈øinful volition. But enough has been offered on this head. The opinion, that moral evil is for the be≈øt, is much more ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able on the principles of tho≈øe who a≈øcribe cau≈øality and ≈øelf-determination to the creature, and ≈øuppo≈øe ≈øin aro≈øe from the abu≈øe of free-will, maintaining no influence or di≈øpo≈øal of the divine being in it, but only his <hi>permi≈ø≈øion</hi> of it, or <hi>≈øuffering</hi> it to come to pa≈øs‚Äîthan on the principles of tho≈øe who a≈øcribe moral evil to his <hi>efficiency.</hi> The for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer opinion ≈øhews a re≈øpect to the moral character of God: The advocates for it ≈øay, he taketh occa≈øion to bring good out of evil‚Äîto over-rule the exi≈øtence of ≈øin for the be≈øt. The e≈øpou≈øers of the latter opinion ≈øeem boldly to ≈øay, that God doth evil, that good may come. Can a being of perfect moral excellence give exi≈øtence to ≈øin by his influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence? Can it be faulty in the ≈øubject, and yet proceed from

him as the cau≈øe? We pre≈øume it has been made evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that neither of the≈øe things can be true.</p>
            <p>The ≈øcheme under examination ≈øuppo≈øeth God to be the cau≈øe of every thing, and con≈øequently of ≈øin‚Äîhence ≈øin is infered to be be≈øt, becau≈øe it is ≈øuppo≈øed to proceed from God in this manner. Were moral agents left to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine them≈øelves, then it is pleaded, the events depend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on their determination would be contingent, and might not come to pa≈øs; which is ≈øuppo≈øed to be irreconcileable with the pre≈øcience and decrees of God‚Äîthe plan of his government. Moral evil being part of his plan, to render it's exi≈øtence <hi>certain,</hi> he determined, it is ≈øaid, to <hi>effect</hi> it by his providence‚Äîby his own <hi>power and agency;</hi> as much as he determined to create the world by an exertion of his power. The difficulty from divine pre≈øcience ≈øhall be examined in it's place. But if the above mentioned foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation be fal≈øe, the inference, that ≈øin is for the be≈øt cannot be ≈øupported by it, even granting the thing infered to be true in it≈øelf.</p>
            <p>On his principles Mr. Edwards (with good rea≈øon) ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed it would be objected, that God may do evil that good may come. But how hath his an≈øwer removed the objection, if it be indeed true, as he teacheth, that moral evil is a part of God's infinite ≈øcheme‚Äîan effect of his determining and di≈øpo≈øing‚Äîand therefore be≈øt? If ≈øo, is it unfit and un≈øuitable in it's nature, or of bad tendency? Can that be a <hi>nece≈ø≈øary means</hi> of the greate≈øt good in the divine ≈øy≈øtem, which is upon the whole either unfit and un≈øuitable in it's nature, or bad in it's tendency? In order to accompli≈øh his own holy and benevolent ends, is infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nite wi≈ødom compelled to make u≈øe of unholy and male<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent means? means unfit and un≈øuitable in their nature, and in their tendency bad? How can ≈øuch things ≈øtand in the relation of means to the propo≈øed end? Mr. Edwards mu≈øt either ≈øay, that God doth evil that good may come, or el≈øe that moral evil is a thing fit in it's nature, and good in it's tendency. For to be the cau≈øe of an evil effect is evidently to do evil; and though ≈øuch evil be improved as a means of great general good, the end will not ≈øanctify or alter the means. No being can, with a good intent,
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:012746_0084_0F90914688624550"/>
be the de≈øigned cau≈øe of moral evil. Yet it is in≈øi≈øted on, that moral evil is determined and de≈øigned by God‚Äî"a part of his own infinite ≈øcheme." And if it is his deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mining act, then he is the cau≈øe of it. Plain common ≈øen≈øe, unperverted by metaphy≈øics, teacheth the world, that holy means only are <hi>adapted</hi> to an holy end; and that no ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øeable reference of moral evil to a good end can ju≈øtify any moral agent in having recour≈øe to it to effect his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øigns‚Äîmuch le≈øs can a being of infinite perfection, who can be at no lo≈øs for proper means to accompli≈øh his own ends, fir≈øt be the cau≈øe of wickedne≈øs, that by this, as a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary means, he may bring to pa≈øs the purpo≈øes of his holine≈øs and goodne≈øs. The nature of the means will be the ≈øame, whatever be the end in view. After all the ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phi≈øtical pains that have been taken to ≈øhew, that moral evil, though infinitely hateful in it's nature and tendency, is yet a nece≈ø≈øary well-adapted means of the greate≈øt good, and as ≈øuch fir≈øt effected by the deity, and then improved by him to advance the greate≈øt happine≈øs in his ≈øy≈øtem, it yet remains problematical, or far from being proved that un≈øpotted purity can be the author of ≈øin. If we ≈øhould grant it to be be≈øt that moral evil hath come into exi≈øtence, will it therefore follow, that it is an effect proceeding from divine efficiency? or that it is be≈øt the ≈øupreme cau≈øe ≈øhou'd be the <hi>author</hi> of it? "They who think and talk in this ≈øtrain <hi>ought to remember,</hi>" that they have no rea≈øon to complain, if the world e≈øteem it "an in≈øtance of the greate≈øt arrogance" and audacious impiety.</p>
            <p>"Though the actual permi≈ø≈øion of evil," ≈øays bi≈øhop Butler, <q>may be beneficial to the world: (that is, it would have been more mi≈øchievous, not that a wicked per≈øon had <hi>him≈øelf</hi> ab≈øtained from his own wickedne≈øs, <hi>but that any one had forcibly prevented it,</hi> than that it was permitted:) Yet notwith≈øtanding, it might have been much better for the world, if this very evil had never been done. Nay, it is mo≈øt clearly conceivable, that the very com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi≈ø≈øion of wickedne≈øs may be beneficial to the world, and yet, that it would be infinitely more beneficial for men to refrain from it. For thus, in the wi≈øe and good con≈øtitution of the natural world, there are di≈øorders
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:012746_0085_0F909147391042D8"/>
which bring their own cures; di≈øea≈øes, which are them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelves remedies. Many a man would have died, had it not been for the gout or a fever; yet it would be tho't madne≈øs to a≈ø≈øert, that ≈øickne≈øs is a better or a more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ≈øtate than health; though the like, with regard to the moral world, has been a≈ø≈øerted.</q>
            </p>
            <p>With mo≈øt Chri≈øtians it might be laid down for a <hi>po≈øtulatum,</hi> that the knowledge, imitation and enjoyment of God were his end in the formation of moral and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable, creatures. Whence it will follow, that the greate≈øt good of the intelligent creation is to fall in with that in≈øtruction in the oracles of truth; (contrary to ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in modern metaphy≈øics) <hi>Let him that glorieth, glory in this, that he under≈øtandeth and knoweth me, that I am the Lord, which exerci≈øe loving-kindne≈øs, judgment and righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs in the earth: For in the≈øe things I delight, ≈øaith the Lord.</hi> This clearly points out the Creator's view and de≈øign in giving being to moral agents‚Äîwhat <hi>his</hi> own ≈øcheme is‚Äîwhat ≈øhould be <hi>their</hi> fir≈øt and la≈øt end, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded by them as the one thing needful‚Äî≈øhewing them how they may fall in with the de≈øigns and exertions of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite wi≈ødom for the advancement of their holine≈øs and highe≈øt happine≈øs, and thereby attain the end of their cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. To live without remembrance or knowledge of God, in contradiction to the above mentioned moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, which he di≈øplays in his own government of the world, and propounds to the imitation of the ≈øubjects of his moral government‚Äîto ≈øin again≈øt him without fear‚Äî we need not ≈øcruple to ≈øay, this would be to oppo≈øe his de≈øigns. If his end in the creation of moral agents was, that they might be conformed to him and ble≈ø≈øed in his likene≈øs and friend≈øhip; <hi>perhaps</hi> it may be infered, that he had no ≈øecret de≈øign contrary to this. <hi>Perhaps</hi> it may follow, that he did not make rebel angels at fir≈øt with this view, that he might be the cau≈øe of their rebellion, and then puni≈øh them eternally for what was the effect of his own determining act, as a means of di≈øplaying his holine≈øs and ju≈øtice and mercy, of e≈øtabli≈øhing his dominion and authority, of promoting and ≈øecuring the moral rectitude of their fellows. "They who talk or think in this ≈øtrain,"

               <hi>≈øeem</hi> not to under≈øtand what they ≈øay, nor whereof they affirm. Such things publi≈øhed by unknown authors would be generally ≈øuppo≈øed to proceed from di≈øbelief of religion, natural and revealed.</p>
            <p>From what has been ob≈øerved, it follows, that moral evil was not God's end in the creation of moral agents; and con≈øequently, that it was not part of his ≈øcheme to bring them to the enjoyment of him≈øelf, or ≈øecure to them this felicity, by means of moral evil. They who ≈øay ≈øo ought to prove the≈øe two things. Fir≈øt, That moral evil is a nece≈ø≈øary means of qualifying moral agents for the enjoyment of God, or of their everla≈øting ≈øecurity of his friend≈øhip. Secondly, That he hath pre≈øcribed it as the true medium to this end, and determined it's exi≈øtence with this view. In other words, that ≈øin is the appointed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dium of holine≈øs and happine≈øs‚Äînece≈ø≈øary to the moral perfection of the intelligent creation. We are too ≈øen≈øible what ≈øort of employment he mu≈øt have who undertakes this, to ≈øpend time in expo≈øing the ab≈øurdity of ≈øuch a ≈øcheme.</p>
            <p>That holine≈øs is the greate≈øt good of the moral world, we beg leave to take for granted. We don't de≈øire to maintain a controver≈øy with tho≈øe who deny it. This prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple being admitted, the enquiry is, what hath the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>recte≈øt tendency to promote holine≈øs? For that is for the be≈øt, which hath this tendency. Now we may appeal to common ≈øen≈øe, whether moral evil is mo≈øt eligible in this view. Whether that which ≈øtands in direct oppo≈øition to holine≈øs hath the mo≈øt direct tendency to it, or conduceth to the highe≈øt degrees of it. Do contraries promote and advance each other? Is greater happine≈øs attained by a partial remedy of an evil, than would be by preventing it? Which is mo≈øt honorable to the infinite Creator, to ≈øay, that the original powers and a≈ø≈øi≈øtances imparted to the creature were ≈øufficient to his continuing upright, and that his fall aro≈øe from the abu≈øe of them? Or to ≈øay, that his fall aro≈øe from a defect of original advantages, or the withdraw of divine influence?</p>
            <p>Natural evil appears plainly to be the con≈øequence of moral, and not moral the con≈øequence of natural, as a late

            <p>Mr. Edwards ≈øuppo≈øeth, that all events which <hi>have taken place</hi> may <hi>therefore</hi> be inferred to be agreable to infinite wi≈ødom and goodne≈øs and part of the ≈øcheme of the ≈øuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendent of the univer≈øe‚Äîand that all events which <hi>ever will take place</hi> fall within his plan and de≈øign, for the ≈øame rea≈øon. Whence it follows, that what≈øoever <hi>hath not,</hi> or <hi>will not come to pa≈øs,</hi> is di≈øagreable to him, contrary to his ≈øcheme of government. For were it agreable to his wi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and goodne≈øs, he would chu≈øe it; and if he cho≈øe, he would determine it; and if he determined it, he would bring it to pa≈øs. Con≈øequently, he chu≈øeth and de≈øireth not the repentance of ≈øuch as die impenitent. For this would be to chu≈øe ≈øomething in contravention of his infinite ≈øcheme. Con≈øequently, he hath not commanded them to repent; or if he hath, then he hath commanded what is not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to his wi≈ødom and goodne≈øs. Or if his de≈øire is expre≈ø≈øed in his commands, then the thing de≈øired not taking place; he mu≈øt be infinitely cro≈ø≈øed and grieved, in proportion to his infinite love and de≈øire of righteou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and hatred of wickedne≈øs. For this is Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards's own inference, if any thing is ≈øuppo≈øed to come to pa≈øs which God chu≈øeth and de≈øireth not‚Äîor fails of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pa≈øs which he chu≈øeth ≈øhould come to pa≈øs. Doth he therefore not chu≈øe (notwith≈øtanding the frequent de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clarations and a≈ø≈øevertaions in his word) that impenitents (finally remaining ≈øuch) ≈øhould turn and live?

of his goodne≈øs and forbearance, in the day of vi≈øitation, not de≈øigned to lead them to repentance? Is it not que≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionable, upon the whole, whether he is a lover of holine≈øs? For how much would the renovation of impenitents add to the ≈øum total of holine≈øs in the univer≈øe? But this is not a thing cho≈øen and de≈øired, <hi>becau≈øe it doth not come to pa≈øs</hi>‚Äîand for this <hi>good</hi> rea≈øon it would not be be≈øt. Or will any undertake to ≈øhew, that the impenitency of great multitudes is a means of proportionably more holine≈øs in other beings‚Äîthat the holine≈øs of a ≈ømall number com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively is ≈øo amazingly increa≈øed <hi>by this means,</hi> that the amount of holine≈øs and happine≈øs in the ≈øy≈øtem will be great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, than if all abandoned ≈øinners had been led to repentance? greater than if all created free-agents had continu'd holy? Or admit this, the con≈øequence then is, that the impeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent wickedne≈øs and eternal puni≈øhment of the greate≈øt part of the intelligent creation is a nece≈ø≈øary means, thro' which the governor of the world effects the ends of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs and goodne≈øs with re≈øpect to a remnant that ≈øhall be ≈øaved. But it yet remains to be ≈øhewn, that ≈øuch means are adapted to the ends of the greate≈øt holine≈øs and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pine≈øs, upon the whole.</p>
            <p>
               <q>If moral evil, and the puni≈øhment of it are nece≈ø≈øary towards promoting univer≈øal good, then the more wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed men are, the more they promote that good; and the more they co-operate with their Creator in compleating his great and benevolent plan of univer≈øal happine≈øs.</q> It is argued, that ≈øince <q>mi≈øery brings with it it's utility, why may not wickedne≈øs?</q>

               <q>That though ≈øin in us, who ≈øee no farther than the evils it produceth, is evil, and ju≈øtly puni≈øhable; yet in God, who ≈øees the cau≈øes and connections of all things, and the nece≈ø≈øity of it's admi≈ø≈øion,</q> it is not ≈øo, but very good. <q>Thus, robbery may di≈øper≈øe u≈øele≈øs hoards to the benefit of the public; adultery may bring heirs and good humor too into many families where "they would other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe have been wanting; and murder free the world from tyrants and oppre≈ø≈øors.

and vanity its ten thou≈øands. Super≈øtition and arbitrary power contribute to the grandeur of many nations, and the liberties of others are pre≈øerved by the perpetual contentions of avarice, knavery, ≈øelfi≈øhne≈øs and ambition.

               <note n="*" place="bottom">Letters on the origin of evil, p. 86, 87; 109.110.</note> Therefore the≈øe vices are for the be≈øt‚Äîand by con≈øequence the vicious per≈øons ≈øome of the mo≈øt benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial members of ≈øociety.

Indeed, he is an enemy to the world, who doth not take ≈øatisfaction in moral evil, and prai≈øe God for it's exi≈øtence, if the doctrine we are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amining be true. For hath it contributed ≈øo much to the perfection and happine≈øs of the moral world? could not the divine character have been manife≈øted to the creatures to good advantage without it? is it's exi≈øtence the effect of divine determination? and doth it become us to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or repent of <hi>that</hi> which was a nece≈ø≈øary means of the greate≈øt po≈ø≈øible good?

            <p>Upon what evidence, by what rea≈øoning, do men fix down in this conclu≈øion, that the moral rectitude of holy angels would have been peculiarly endangered had there been no apo≈øtates, the terror of who≈øe puni≈øhment is ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øed to ≈øecure the inhabitants of the world above in their allegiance? How does it appear that holy angels would have reverenced their maker and father le≈øs, or been le≈øs apprehen≈øive of his authority, had moral evil never taken place?

to the character of a wi≈øe, ju≈øt and benevolent earthly ≈øo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign. Can the ends of his government be attained, and his true character made to appear, only by means of the rebellion of his ≈øubjects! Is it nece≈ø≈øary to ≈øecure him that re≈øpect and reverence to which he is intituled, that a great part of his people ≈øhould revolt, and be capitally puni≈øhed!

For it is doubtle≈øs be≈øt the character of ≈øuch a ≈øovereign, and the nature of his admini≈øtration, ≈øhould be known, and that the ends of his government ≈øhould be effected. In a word, will not the doctrine before us terminate in this, that it is be≈øt there ≈øhould be no law or government human or divine? For better no law or government than ≈øuch as it is be≈øt ≈øhould be violated and contemned.

            <p>'Tis well that the under≈øtandings of the generality of mankind are not perverted by metaphy≈øical ≈øubtilties. Common people have no manner of doubt but ≈øin is an evil thing and a bitter‚Äîthe ≈øource of all mi≈øery. They have no doubt but it had been well for the world had this accur≈øed thing never entred into it. They never once imagine that God hath plea≈øure in it; that he is the cau≈øe of it, or determines moral agents to it‚Äîthey ≈øuppo≈øe that moral evil is a thing to which creatures are determined of them≈øelves, agreable to the plain ≈øen≈øe of the apo≈øtle's words, <q>Let no man ≈øay, when he is tempted, I am tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of God: For God cannot be tempted with evil, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tempteth he any man. But every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lu≈øt, and enticed.</q> Common people have penetration enough to keep up a di≈øtinction between God's being the cau≈øe of natural good and evil, and his being the cau≈øe of moral evil‚ÄîThey rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily admit a po≈øitive influence of the Deity in holine≈øs, but not in wickedne≈øs. If ≈øome modern metaphy≈øicians had the ≈øen≈øe and di≈øcernment of the vulgar in the≈øe matters, it would be happy for them≈øelves and the world. The

common people have been educated in the belief of ≈øuch things as the≈øe; that the mo≈øt exalted motives to holine≈øs are a con≈øideration of it's intrin≈øic beauty and excellence, it's tendency to dignify the intelligent nature, to advance the divine glory and ≈øecure his approbation. They have believed that the fear of eternal puni≈øhment is but an infe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rior principle of action‚Äîa ≈øpirit that ruleth in ≈ølaves, not in ≈øons. Are the≈øe mere vulgar errors? So it ≈øhould ≈øeem, if it be true that the puni≈øhment of devils is what ≈øecureth the per≈øevering holine≈øs of angels and glorified ≈øpirits, and e≈øtabli≈øheth the divine authority in their hearts.</p>
            <p>Mr. Edwards hath no where ≈øaid, that moral evil might not have been prevented, but rather intimated the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Nor hath he denied but the human apo≈øtacy might have been permitted without the provi≈øion of a ≈øavior. However, on his principles neither of the≈øe things may be ≈øuppo≈øed. For he hath ventured to ≈øay, he is CERTAIN that moral evil is for the be≈øt‚Äîand that an infinitely wi≈øe being mu≈øt therefore chu≈øe it. Whether it follows or not from the hints that have been given, that moral evil is not be≈øt for the world, we are by no means very ≈øollicitous, becau≈øe we chu≈øe not to be peremptory and confident. Yet we apprehend enough has been ≈øaid to create ≈øuch a degree of ≈øu≈øpicion whether it is indeed be≈øt, that <hi>few</hi> "per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øons of good under≈øtanding will ≈øay, they are certain it is be≈øt." Or thus much at lea≈øt we ≈øuppo≈øe will follow from the things that have been ob≈øerved, that the advantage of moral evil to the world is not proveable in the way Mr. Edwards has attempted to prove it‚Äîthe re≈øult of which is, that God may do evil, that good may come. Two pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øitions appear to be mutually a≈ø≈øumed by him to prove each other: One while he makes a po≈øtulatum of this, that whatever is, is <hi>therefore</hi> be≈øt; and proceeds to argue, that God determines moral agents to ≈øin. At another time, making a po≈øtulatum of this la≈øt po≈øition, he proceeds to argue, that ≈øin mu≈øt therefore be infinitely beneficial to the world. What part ≈øoever of his di≈øcour≈øe be examined, the plain con≈øequence appears to be this, that God is the cau≈øe of all wickedne≈øs.</p>

            <p>NO que≈øtion on the ≈øubject of morals hath more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexed the learned than this, How is divine pre≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence reconcileable with liberty in the creature? While mo≈øt (and among the≈øe the wi≈øe≈øt of men) have mode≈øtly confe≈ø≈øed their ignorance, and looked upon the que≈øtion as unan≈øwerable by an human under≈øtanding; ≈øome few have attempted to ≈øolve the difficulty. But the attempt hath been executed in ≈øuch a manner as hath rather evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denced the folly and arrogance of the undertakers, than cleared the ≈øubject. The reader will hence conclude, that the ≈øolution of this difficulty is not what we propo≈øe in the pre≈øent ≈øection.</p>
            <p>But ≈øince ≈øome gentlemen ≈øeem to ≈øuppo≈øe, that pre≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and liberty cannot both be firmly believed unle≈øs the mind of man can reconcile them‚Äî≈øince Mr. Edwards ≈øeems to think his own ≈øcheme altogether clear of this dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty; and ≈øince from the divine pre≈øcience he infers his doctrine of nece≈ø≈øity; the≈øe things ≈øhall be briefly exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned in this place.</p>
            <p>To ≈øay that pre≈øcience and liberty are ab≈øolutely irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable, becau≈øe we our≈øelves cannot reconcile them, would be to take the dimen≈øions of the divine mind from our own. An infinite under≈øtanding may be able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concile them, when a finite cannot. If any ≈øubject in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves difficulties, which we cannot ≈øolve, we may not immediately infer a contradiction in it. For what ≈øubject can be mentioned that doth not involve ≈øuch difficulties? If we determine to believe no doctrines, till we ≈øee <hi>how</hi> the≈øe things can be, this will land us in ab≈øolute ≈øceptici≈øm.

Do we believe nothing but what we can give a rationale of? 'Tis manife≈øt then, that we do not believe the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine exi≈øtence, nor that of any other beings or things‚Äî not even our own exi≈øtence. For who pretends to know after what manner God exi≈øts? or to be acquainted with the e≈ø≈øences of other things? The divine eternity, infinity, omni≈øcience, &amp;c. tran≈øcend all our conceptions. We are wholly ignorant how our own ≈øouls and bodies are united‚Äî are lo≈øt in the contemplation of our own frame. The tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and ≈øatisfaction are inexplicable my≈øteries. The ≈øcheme of Chri≈øtianity, and the whole moral government of God, are incomprehen≈øible. Nor would they be other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe, and be worthy of him who is perfect in knowledge. His judgments are un≈øearchable, and his ways pa≈øt find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out. As the heavens are higher than the earth, ≈øo are his thoughts and ways above ours. Although we have ≈øuch evidence in general of the truth and reality of the things above-mentioned as in a manner compels our be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief; yet when the que≈øtion is put, How can the≈øe things be? we di≈øcern in≈øuperable difficulties‚Äîat the ≈øame time we are con≈øcious infidelity would involve us in difficulties ≈øtill greater.</p>
            <p>With re≈øpect to the que≈øtion before us, if the voice of ≈øcripture or rea≈øon be hearkned to, we mu≈øt admit both pre≈øcience and liberty‚Äîand that they are con≈øi≈øtent, tho' after a manner inconceivable by us. For we cannot be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve evident contradictions.</p>
            <p>We u≈øe the term foreknowledge in accommodation to our own narrow views and way of conceiving things. In an infinite under≈øtanding, there is no before or after‚Äî no ≈øucce≈ø≈øion of ideas. To him who calleth things that are not as though they were, and with whom a thou≈øand years are as one day, the knowledge of futurity is pre≈øent, knowledge. How then can a finite mind conceive the manner of his knowing futurity? Is there any thing in vi≈øible creation that affords a re≈øemblance of what we call pre≈øcience. When we undertake to ≈øpeak on a ≈øubject ≈øo high and too wonderful for us, it becomes us to be dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident of our≈øelves, and very ≈øparing of words, remember<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that we are of ye≈øterday‚ÄîTho≈øe ≈øeem not aware of

their own ignorance, and the danger of ≈øpeaking of God the thing that is not right, who attempt to explain this matter; as though by ≈øearching they could find out God ‚Äîas though he had taken coun≈øel with them. Ha≈øt thou heard the ≈øecret of God? And do≈øt thou re≈øtrain wi≈ødom to thy≈øelf?</p>
            <p>Some men are apt to depart from evident truth out of regard to ab≈øtru≈øe ≈øpeculations. They turn a≈øide from the plain road of common ≈øen≈øe, di≈ødaining a beaten track, and are carried away with the error of the wicked, under pretence of new and important di≈øcoveries. If any truth be plain, this is, that man is free. Next to the con≈øciou≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs of our own exi≈øtence is that of our moral freedom. Yet a truth ≈øo obvious is called in que≈øtion by ≈øome men, becau≈øe they cannot make it agree with the idea they have formed of God's infinite knowledge and eternal coun≈øels.</p>
            <p>
               <q>As to the manner of God's foreknowing certainly contingent future events, that is, which have no nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary cau≈øe, nor are to be accompli≈øhed by his own power, and the determination of his will, but produc'd by other free agents; this ≈øeems to be incomprehen≈øible by the human under≈øtanding. That any mind ≈øhould fore≈øee with certainty a di≈øtant event, which does not nece≈ø≈øarily proceed from the nature of things, nor is fix'd by the purpo≈øe of a voluntary agent, is wonderful to us and far ≈øurpa≈ø≈øeth our conception. For as our knowledge of futurity can only re≈øt on one or other of the≈øe founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, we can form no di≈øtinct notion of any foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge without them. It is probably their apprehending the divine pre≈øcience after the ≈øame manner, and limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to the ≈øame grounds, which has occa≈øioned ≈øo much perplexity in the minds of men, and involved their ≈øpeculations upon this ≈øubject in ≈øo much confu≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Some imagining that contingent events could not otherwi≈øe be ≈øo a≈øcertained, as to be infallibly known, have ≈øuppo≈øed peremptory eternal decrees concerning all of them, even the free≈øt actions of men; and not only ≈øo, but a previous divine influence on the active powers of rational creatures, exciting them to action: But others judging this to be utterly incon≈øi≈øtent with human liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,

and, with re≈øpect to evil actions, incon≈øi≈øtent with the purity and goodne≈øs of the divine nature, yet ≈øtill adhering to the ≈øame limited foundation of foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, have denied the doctrine of pre≈øcience altogether, or doubted concerning it. I believe the be≈øt way for us to get rid of the≈øe difficulties is wholly to neglect the hypothe≈øes, which have been invented to account for the manner of the divine pre≈øcience, acknowledging that it is to us inexplicable, and yet concluding that this is no ≈øufficient objection again≈øt a doctrine, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wi≈øe well confirmed.</q>

            <p>"I admire," ≈øays Dr. Eliot, <q>the mode≈øty, as well as goodne≈øs of heart, di≈øcovered by the great Mr. Locke, in one of his letters to Mr. Molineux; "I freely own," ≈øays he, "the weakne≈øs of my under≈øtanding, that though it be unque≈øtionable, that there is omnipotence and om<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øcience in God our maker, and I cannot have a clearer perception of any thing than that I am free; yet I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not make freedom in man con≈øi≈øtent with omnipotence and omni≈øcience in God, though I am as fully per≈øuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of both as of any truths I mo≈øt firmly a≈ø≈øent to, and therefore I have long ≈øince left off the con≈øideration of the que≈øtion.</q> The Doctor ≈øubjoins to the≈øe words of Mr. Locke the following pertinent and ≈øea≈øonable reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: <q>If ≈øome of our modern rea≈øoners, who have not a tenth part of his under≈øtanding, had a little more of his humility, the world would be free from tho≈øe angry di≈øputes about fate and free-will, liberty and nece≈ø≈øity, which puzzle the heads, but ≈øeldom mend the hearts, of tho≈øe who engage in them.</q>

            <p>To proceed: Pre≈øcience is a difficulty that encumbers Mr. Edwards's own ≈øcheme no le≈øs than that of his oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nents. For he ≈øaith, <q>There mu≈øt be a certainty in things them≈øelves before they are certainly foreknown,</q> and affirms that the former "is the foundation" of the latter. (P. 22; 175.) Events have <q>a fixed certain futurity prior to</q> foreknowledge, and this antecedent nece≈ø≈øity of their coming to pa≈øs is the cau≈øe of their being certainly foreknown. What is meant by the certainty in things
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:012746_0097_0F8BED47BACD4C88"/>
them≈øelves prior to their exi≈øtence, is as unintelligible as his opinion, <q>that there is in the nature of things a foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for the knowledge of the being of God, without any evidence of it from his works;</q> of which notice was taken, Examination, p. 36. marg. If by this certainty be meant any thing different from the divine decrees and determinations, then his argument will ≈øtand thus: The certainty there is in things them≈øelves is the foundation of the divine decrees; the divine decrees are the foundation of foreknowledge; and foreknowledge is the foundation of that nece≈ø≈øity which belongs to all events in the natural and moral world. This <hi>≈øeems</hi> to be arguing in a circle. On the other hand, if by this certainty in things them≈øelves be meant the ≈øame as the divine decrees and determinations, then the≈øe being the ≈øuppo≈øed foundation of foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, the latter cannot be the cau≈øe of events, as Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards repre≈øents, but the former. Nece≈ø≈øity is the cau≈øe of the knowledge of events, and not the knowledge of them the cau≈øe of their nece≈ø≈øity.</p>
            <p>Further, If the purpo≈øes and decrees of God, or his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terminations as to futurity, be antecedent to foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, and the foundation thereof, then his will is deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined "at random, by blind contingence," without de≈øign or fore≈øight‚Äî<q>guided by no wi≈ødom, no motive, no intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent dictate whatever‚Äîhe only acts by an <hi>Hobbi≈øtical</hi> fatality.</q> (P. 330, 334.) To ≈øpeak of the divine will as determined prior to knowledge, is plainly to ≈øuppo≈øe it determined without coun≈øel and wi≈ødom, undirected by knowledge and intelligence. And what holine≈øs can there be in ≈øuch determinations? It was ≈øurely through want of "reflection and re≈øearch"‚Äîthrough inattention to his own ≈øcheme, that Mr. Edwards grounds the certainty of fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledge on an antecedent nece≈ø≈øity of events ari≈øing from the divine coun≈øels and purpo≈øes. He repre≈øents the opinion of tho≈øe who teach that God's foreknowledge is antecedent to his decrees, as a ≈øervile ≈øubjecting the Deity to fatal nece≈ø≈øity; and ≈øaith, it argues inferiority and ≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vitude unworthy of him, and comports with the heathen notion of fate as above the gods; becau≈øe this is to ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe, ≈øaith he, that events have a fixed certain futurity, to
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:012746_0098_0F8BED487B16FFB8"/>
which the divine volitions and de≈øigns are ≈øubject, and mu≈øt be accommodated. (p. 352, 353.) 'Tis not a little ≈øurprizing, that Mr. Edwards did not perceive this objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was much more applicable to his own doctrine, than to that of his oppo≈øers. Be≈øides, How do the≈øe things agree with his own words, p. 325. <q>We mu≈øt conceive of the perfection of the divine under≈øtanding as the <hi>foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation</hi> of his wi≈øe purpo≈øes and decrees.</q> As he is not herein reconcileable with him≈øelf, ≈øo his principles are not con≈øi≈øtent with the admi≈ø≈øion of forkenowledge. To ≈øay, the certainty of things, or divine determination of events, is <hi>antecedent</hi> to his perfect knowledge of futurity, is to deny <hi>pre≈øcience,</hi> and only to a≈øcribe <hi>after-knowledge</hi> to God. So that while Mr. Edwards ≈øuppo≈øeth his own ≈øcheme of ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity clear of all difficulty from the head of fore-know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, it appears not only to militate with it≈øelf, but utterly to preclude that pre≈øcience from which he infers the nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity of all events.</p>
            <p>We will now enquire, in the la≈øt place, whether pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience implies nece≈ø≈øity. Mr. Edwards u≈øeth the terms certainty and nece≈ø≈øity, as tho' they were perfectly ≈øynony<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous; and ≈øaith, <q>Philo≈øophical nece≈ø≈øity is nothing dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from certainty.</q> (P. 22.) It is granted by all who believe fore-knowledge, that <hi>this</hi> really implies the certainty of all future events‚Äînot only that they will come to pa≈øs, but al≈øo that they will come to pa≈øs in ≈øuch a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain manner. But the inference is not, that they will come to pa≈øs <hi>nece≈ø≈øarily</hi> becau≈øe fore-known‚Äîthat they are indi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øolubly connected as effects with pre≈øcience as their cau≈øe. Now it is in this ≈øen≈øe that Mr. Edwards maintains nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity. If fore-knowledge infers nece≈ø≈øity (in his ≈øen≈øe of the word nece≈ø≈øity) then it implies an irre≈øi≈øtible determination of the wills and actions of moral agents.</p>
            <p>Pre≈øcience has no cau≈øality in the coming to pa≈øs of the≈øe things which are the objects of it. So far is it from hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any <hi>efficiency</hi> to produce them, that it hath no influence to their production by way of <hi>motive</hi> or excitement. For a motive is ≈øomething extant in the mind's view. Now can any moral agent know, previous to any given volition or action, that he ≈øhall certainly be determined to ≈øuch vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lition
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:012746_0099_0F8BED4938A9E7B8"/>
or action? If not, then he cannot know that ≈øuch voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion or action is certainly foreknown. For this would be to ≈øay, that what may never become effect may be foreknown. And if moral agents cannot tell beforehand what is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known with re≈øpect to them≈øelves, then foreknowledge can have no influence in determining their actions. For what is not <hi>perceived</hi> cannot excite or move to action; or de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termine the wills of moral agents; nor con≈øequently be con≈øidered as the cau≈øe, ground, or rea≈øon of their being de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to this or that. "Nothing," ≈øays Mr. Edwards, <q>can induce or invite the mind to will or act any thing, any further than it is perceived, or is ≈øome way or other in the mind's view.</q> (p. 8.) To ≈øay that pre≈øcience is in the view of the creature's mind, wou'd be to a≈øcribe an incommunicable attribute of the Creator to a creature. Foreknowledge, then, has no influence in bringing any moral volitions to pa≈øs‚Äînor is it even an <hi>occa≈øion</hi> of their becoming effect. It doth not ≈øtand in the relation of a cau≈øe, motive, rea≈øon or occa≈øion to the exi≈øtence of things to come, any more than our knowledge of things pa≈øt or pre≈øent has ≈øuch relation to their exi≈øtence. Herein we have Mr. Edwards's concurrence, p. 175. <q>I freely allow that foreknowledge don't prove a thing to be nece≈ø≈øary, any more than after knowledge.</q> Now doth our know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that a thing is already come to pa≈øs imply that it came to pa≈øs nece≈ø≈øarily? If not, then neither doth foreknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of a future event imply that ≈øuch event mu≈øt come to pa≈øs by nece≈ø≈øity. That we know certainly an event hath already taken place, doth not imply that the nature of that event, or the manner of it's coming to pa≈øs, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined by our knowledge. No more doth divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øcience affect the <hi>nature</hi> of events, or the <hi>manner</hi> of their coming into exi≈øtence.</p>
            <p>Mr. Edwards, as hath been ob≈øerved, makes the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine determination, and deci≈øive ordering and di≈øpo≈øing of all events, the ground of their being foreknown‚Äîhe ≈øuppo≈øeth the divine determinations alike concern'd in moral volitions and actions, as in tho≈øe things which are the mere work of God‚Äîthat it properly belongs to him to di≈øpo≈øe, fix and determine the wills of all moral agents,
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:012746_0100_0F8BED49F8E48F58"/>
in every act, from the beginning of their exi≈øtence. And though he a≈ø≈øerts not in words a po≈øitive agency of God in evil actions; yet the thing in effect is a≈ø≈øerted, as hath been ≈øhewn. <note n="*" place="bottom">Section IV.</note> Upon his ≈øcheme God is the author and cau≈øe of ≈øin; no le≈øs than of natural good and evil‚Äîthe author and cau≈øe of men's vices, no le≈øs than the giver and upholder of life, and fountain of their natural endow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and external advantages and enjoyments‚Äîthe au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of evil di≈øpo≈øitions, no le≈øs than of holy and virtuous ones. But do not rea≈øon and ≈øcripture ≈øhew us, that there is an important difference between his being the author of the former and his being ≈øo of the latter‚Äî? that his ope<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, his determining and di≈øpo≈øing providence, cannot extend to moral evil? <note n="‚Äñ" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Every good gift, and every perfect gift, is from above, and cometh down from the father of lights.</hi> But <hi>God cannot be tempted with [moral] evil, neither tempteth he any man.</hi> James 1.13; 17. compared. All natural good and evil proceed from God as the proper cau≈øe. <hi>I, even I am he, and there is no god with me: I kill, and I make alive: I wound, and I heal. Neither is there any that can deliver out of my hand.</hi> (Deut. 32.39.) If it be a≈øk'd, how can natural evil, any more than moral, proceed from a good cau≈øe? the u≈øual an≈øwer is ≈øufficient, that the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer is the penal con≈øequence of the latter. The difference between God's being the author of natural evil and of moral‚Äîbetween his being the fountain of holine≈øs and of ≈øin, is ≈øo obvious and important, and ≈øo clearly marked in ≈øcripture, that 'tis difficult to ≈øee how any man can excu≈øe him≈øelf in confounding the≈øe things. <q>The effects of nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary cau≈øes are, properly ≈øpeaking.

We need not ≈øcruple to ≈øay that the certainty of events, which foreknowledge implies is as diver≈øe from Mr. Edwards's philo≈øophic nece≈ø≈øity as truth is from fal≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, or light from darkne≈øs. To ≈øupport his inference from foreknowledge, it was incumbent on him to ≈øhew, that this is an extrin≈øic efficient cau≈øe, who≈øe influence and operation brings into effect the things foreknown. To ≈øay, that foreknowledge is an <hi>antecedent,</hi> and the things foreknown <hi>con≈øequents,</hi> is but trifling, unle≈øs it can be ≈øhewn that the latter are indi≈ø≈øolubly connected with the former as the <hi>cau≈øe</hi> of their exi≈øtence.

            <p>"Foreknowledge," ≈øaith an excellent writer, <q>has no influence at all upon the nature of things, to make the lea≈øt alteration in them.

            <head>SECTION VIII. On texts of ≈øcripture mi≈øcon≈øtrued.</head>
            <p>IF from what has been ≈øaid it ≈øhould appear, that Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme of nece≈ø≈øity may ju≈øtly be charged with making an holy and good God the proper cau≈øe of ≈øin, (which is the leading objection we have all along had to his book on the will) it can be to every little purpo≈øe to alledge texts of ≈øcripture in ≈øupport of it. A doctrine ≈øo repugnant to our natural apprehen≈øions of God and his providence cannot be ≈øupported by any pretence of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity from him. The holy ≈øcriptures were not given to contradict and ≈øubvert tho≈øe notions of his moral perfecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and government, which God hath given us by rea≈øon and the light of nature; but to confirm and improve them, as well as to afford us important in≈øtruction in things which una≈ø≈øi≈øted rea≈øon would never have di≈øcovered. If any, therefore, ≈øhould bring this doctrine to us, that God is the cau≈øe of moral evil, the direction given to the I≈øra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>elites, in the ca≈øe of being enticed to idolatry, <note n="*" place="bottom">Deut. xiii. 1,‚Äî4.</note> is for our learning, and may ≈øerve to regulate our conduct. We know not what right the advocate for ≈øuch a doctrine can have to any other an≈øwer. His appealing to the word of God to ≈øupport what he advanceth is not very con≈øi≈øtent. For if a doctrine of ≈øuch a nature be true, what faith can be had in any ≈øuppo≈øed revelation from God?</p>
            <p>Yet it may be of u≈øe to ≈øome readers to take notice of the ≈øcriptures which are adduced to confirm the afore≈øaid ≈øcheme. As it would be tedious minutely to examine e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very particular text, we ≈øhall ≈øelect two or three only, on which the principal ≈øtre≈øs is laid. Should the≈øe be found not to favour the ≈øcheme they are brought to ≈øupport, the argument will conclude <hi>a fortiori</hi> with re≈øpect to other texts, which are ≈øuppo≈øed to have le≈øs weight. The pa≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øages in the ≈øacred writings made u≈øe of by Mr. Edwards may be reduced to three general heads. Fir≈øt, Such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øent the taking place of moral evil to be by the deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:012746_0104_0F8BED4E7B430540"/>
coun≈øel, pre≈øcience and ordination of God. Second<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ≈øuch as ≈øpeak of his hardening moral agents in ≈øin. Thirdly, Such as are ≈øuppo≈øed to favor the opinion of the advantage of moral evil to the univer≈øe.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Of ≈øuch texts as repre≈øent the taking place of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral evil to be by the determinate coun≈øel, pre≈øcience and ordination of God.</p>
            <p>Under this head, ≈øuch texts are chiefly in≈øi≈øted on as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to the crucifiction of the LORD OF GLORY. <note n="*" place="bottom">Particularly Luke xxii. 21, 22. Acts ii. 23. iii. 17, 18. iv. 27, 28.</note> Now the≈øe texts either imply an <hi>efficient</hi> determination of the Deity in this event, or they do not: If they do not, they are nothing to the purpo≈øe for which they are produced by the advocates for nece≈ø≈øity. On the other hand, if it can be ≈øhewn that they really imply a divine efficiency on the minds of the murderers of our Lord, influencing and nece≈ø≈øitating them to this horrid deed; then we ≈øhall not he≈øitate to admit, that every ≈øpecies and degree of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs proceeds from the ≈øame efficiency. For if God may be ≈øuppo≈øed to effect by his agency a crime of ≈øuch enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity, what ≈øhould hinder our believing that all moral evil is the product of his action and influence? But let us com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ≈øpiritual things with ≈øpiritual, and form our judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from ≈øuch a compari≈øon in the pre≈øent ca≈øe. Hence it may appear much clearer, that an efficient determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is <hi>not</hi> intended, than it will from the≈øe texts taken by them≈øelves that ≈øuch a determination <hi>is</hi> intended.</p>
            <p>There is a twofold ≈øen≈øe in which tho≈øe moral events, which imply blame in the agents, may yet be ≈øaid to come to pa≈øs by the determinate coun≈øel, fore-knowledge and or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dination of God, without implying any active concurrence or efficiency of divine power herein.</p>
            <p>Fir≈øt, Whatever comes to pa≈øs agreable to the predicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his word, may be ≈øaid to take place by his determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate coun≈øel and foreknowledge: Such events may be cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led what his hand and coun≈øel determined before ≈øhould be done.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Such events as he determines not to prevent by the interpo≈øal of his power, may al≈øo be ≈øaid to come to pa≈øs in the ≈øame way. As all po≈ø≈øible futurity was fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

known to God, it hence follows, that in this ≈øen≈øe the exi≈øtence of all moral evil is by his determinate coun≈øel and foreknowledge: Nor is there any other difficulty in apply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this ≈øcripture language to all moral evil that hath taken place, or ever will, than in the application of it to the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ca≈øe to which it immediately refers in ≈øcripture,‚Äî viz. the ≈øufferings of the holy one and the ju≈øt.</p>
            <p>What one evangeli≈øt hath delivered thus, The ≈øon of man goeth <hi>as it was determined</hi>‚Äî<note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Luke xxii. 22.</note> another expre≈ø≈øeth in the≈øe terms, The ≈øon of man goeth, <hi>as it is written of him,</hi> 
               <note n="‚Ä°" place="bottom">Matt. xxvi. 24.</note> To the ≈øame purpo≈øe ≈øaith St. Peter, Tho≈øe things <hi>which God before had ≈øhewed by the mouth of all his holy prophets,</hi> that Chri≈øt ≈øhould ≈øuffer, he hath ≈øo fulfilled. <note n="*" place="bottom">Acts iii. 18.</note> So Acts xiii. 27. They that dwell at Jeru≈øalem, and their rulers, becau≈øe they knew him not, <hi>nor yet the voices of the prophets,</hi> which are read every ≈øabbath-day, they have fulfilled them, in condemning him. See al≈øo ch. xvii. 2, 3. Luke xxiv. 25, 26. Thus it was the determinate coun≈øel of God, that Chri≈øt ≈øhould ≈øuffer; and in order to this "it was nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øary God ≈øhould" permit him "to fall into the hands of wicked men, (for they could have no power over him, unle≈øs it were thus given them from above) and that he ≈øhould lay no re≈øtraints upon them, from executing their malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous de≈øigns upon him; and this unre≈øtrained permi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øion is all that is, or can be ≈øignified by God's delivering up Chir≈øt into their hands‚ÄîHis power could not <hi>actually concur,</hi> or <hi>effectively</hi> incline them, to the crucifiction of the holy Je≈øus." For although "the hand of God is joined with his council, and applied" to this event; yet "the hand of God relates not ≈øo much to his power, as to his wi≈ødom and providential di≈øpen≈øations." <note n="‚Äñ" place="bottom">Whitby.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The con≈øtruction Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme fixeth on the ≈øcriptures under con≈øideration precludes all di≈øtinction be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the <hi>active</hi> and <hi>permi≈ø≈øive</hi> providence of God‚Äîa di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction which hath hitherto been e≈øteemed important by the Chri≈øtian church. A writer who ≈øpared no pains in collecting the ≈øentiments of criticks and commentators, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient and modern, upon the ≈øcriptures, and hath di≈øcovered equal judgment and learning in this u≈øeful undertaking,
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:012746_0106_0F8BED4FF9A08C58"/>
has given us the ≈øen≈øe of Chri≈øtians on this point with ≈øo much per≈øpicuity and preci≈øion, that we ≈øhall take liberty to make the following extracts. <hi>Con≈øtitutum e≈øt aeterno Dei con≈øilio, et in S. S. declaratum,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>In Engli≈øh thus: It was appointed in God's eternal coun≈øel, and declared in the holy ≈øcriptures. Though God fore≈øaw, and decreed to permit, Judas's betraying Chri≈øt, yet it is not ≈øaid that God determined Judas ≈øhould <hi>betray,</hi> but that Chri≈øt <hi>≈øhould go.</hi> There is indeed a divine decree re≈øpecting the ≈øins of men; but then God only <hi>permits,</hi> and over-rules for good, their ≈øins, and by no means wills or determines their commi≈ø≈øion of them‚Äî<hi>(Lucas Bru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gen≈øis.)</hi> If we enquire concerning the actions of Judas, Pilate and Herod, it is certain, indeed, that they did not happen without the father, ina≈ømuch as a ≈øparrow doth not fall to the ground without him. But the will of God re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øpecting them was <hi>permi≈ø≈øive,</hi> not <hi>efficient;</hi> which di≈øtincti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is more agreable to ≈øcripture, and the judgment of all the primitive Chri≈øtians, than their opinion who would di≈øcriminate <hi>actions</hi> from the <hi>viciou≈øne≈øs</hi> that is in them. This, in regard to many actions, contradicts the nature of things; for in≈øtance, theft, adultery, and the like, the very naming of which is unintelligible, if the idea of ≈øinfulne≈øs be ≈øeperated therefrom. Tho≈øe al≈øo are equally unworthy of regard, who ≈øay, that the Deity impels men to ≈øuch ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for <hi>a good end.</hi> For the end alone cannot make ≈øuch actions right, or ju≈øtify tho≈øe decrees which antecedently impo≈øe an ab≈øolute <hi>nece≈ø≈øity</hi> of committing them.‚ÄîIt may be added, that the name of ≈øin is ab≈øurd, according to the hypothe≈øis ≈øome proceed upon. For we cannot commit ≈øin in tho≈øe actions, which infinite goodne≈øs, by a decree ≈øubver≈øive of the liberty of our <hi>will,</hi> determineth we ≈øhould do. 'Tis more ju≈øt by far to ≈øay with St. Paul, (Acts 14.16.) God <hi>permitted</hi> the nations to walk in their own ways; and if there are any ob≈øcure pa≈ø≈øages el≈øewhere in ≈øcripture to expound them in this ≈øen≈øe; <hi>which all the antients did.</hi> (Clemens Origen, Alexandrinus, Origen, Cyprian, Chry≈øo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom, Salvianus.) Agreably all the antients con≈øtantly affirm, that divine pre≈øcience impo≈øeth on men <hi>no nece≈ø≈øity</hi> of action;
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:012746_0107_0F8BED50BA2FDBD8"/>
which were unmeaning, if foreknowledge it≈øelf be ≈øuppo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed dependent on <hi>efficient</hi> decrees.</p>
            <p>Origen, in his di≈øputation, Whether what is foretold mu≈øt be done? accurately di≈øtingui≈øheth nece≈ø≈øity from permi≈ø≈øion, thus: If the meaning be, <hi>nece≈ø≈øarily</hi> done, we declare for the negative; for it might not have been done, nor was there any nece≈ø≈øity that Judas ≈øhould be a traitor. On the other hand, if no more is meant than not <hi>hindering</hi> the event, which yet might not have become effect, we are for the affirmative. <note n="*" place="bottom">Puli Synop≈øis in Luc. xxii. 22.</note>

            <p>P. 362. of Mr. Edwards's book, Dr. Doddridge is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced in a manner which may lead the reader to ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe his opinion was the ≈øame with Mr. Edwards's. Only the fir≈øt part of the Dr's note on Luke xxii. 22. is quoted. In the latter part of the note on that text, the Dr. has taken particular care to guard that part Mr. Edwards has quoted again≈øt ≈øuch a con≈øtruction as this partial view may induce the public to fix upon the Doctor's words. If the reader turns to the place in Dr. Doddridge, it may give him a different view of the Doctor's ≈øentiments from what Mr. Edwards's quotation exhibits.</p>
            <p>In his note on Acts iv. 28. the Dr. ≈øaith, "It is‚Äîrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal‚Äîto explain this <hi>determination</hi> in ≈øuch a manner, as to make it con≈øi≈øtent with the <hi>free agency</hi> of the per≈øons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. When God's hand and coun≈øel are ≈øaid to have determined the≈øe things, it may ≈øignify God's having <hi>point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out</hi> this great event ≈øo wi≈øely concerted in his eternal coun≈øels, and <hi>marked beforehand</hi> as it were <hi>all the boundaries</hi> of it‚Äîin the <hi>prophetic writings.</hi>"</p>
            <p>What the Doctor's opinion was re≈øpecting the nece≈ø≈øity of moral actions, as proveable from the pre≈øcience and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of God, we further learn from the following pa≈ø≈øages. Jude v. 4. "<hi>Who were regi≈øtered to this condemnation.</hi> The word <hi>[Progegrammenoi]</hi> may well ≈øignify <hi>de≈øcribed</hi> and <hi>put up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on record;</hi> that is, who≈øe character and condemnation may be con≈øidered as de≈øcribed in the puni≈øhment of other noto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ≈øinners, who were a kind of repre≈øentatives of them. Which interpretation I prefer to any other, as it tends to clear God of that heavy imputation which it mu≈øt bring
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:012746_0108_0F8BED5179167C98"/>
on his <hi>moral attributes,</hi> to ≈øuppo≈øe that he <hi>appoints</hi> men to <hi>≈øin</hi> again≈øt him, and then <hi>condemns</hi> them for doing, what they could not but do, and what they were, independent on their own freedom of choice, fated to. A doctrine ≈øo pregnant with <hi>gloomy,</hi> and, as I ≈øhould fear, <hi>fatal</hi> con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, that I think it a part of the duty I owe to the <hi>word of God,</hi> to re≈øcue it from the imputation of contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ≈øuch a tenet."</p>
            <p>Rom. ix. 13. "The≈øe words in their connection with the preceeding and following, do indeed prove, that God acts with a ≈øovereign and unaccountable freedom in the di≈øpen≈øation of his favors,‚ÄîNeverthele≈øs it is certain, the apo≈øtle does not here ≈øpeak of the <hi>eternal ≈øtate of Jacob and E≈øau,</hi> (whatever ≈øome may ≈øuppo≈øe deducible from what he ≈øays,) nor does he indeed ≈øo much ≈øpeak of their <hi>per≈øons,</hi> as of their <hi>po≈øterity;</hi> ≈øince 'tis plainly to that <hi>po≈øterity</hi> that both the <hi>prophecies,</hi> which he quotes in ≈øupport of his argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, refer. Gen. xxv. 23. Mal. i. 2, 3. <hi>His laying wa≈øte the heritage of the Edomites for the dragons of the wilderne≈øs,</hi> is ≈øo different a thing from his appointing the <hi>per≈øon</hi> of <hi>E≈øau</hi> to <hi>eternal mi≈øery</hi> by a mere act of ≈øovereignty, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to any thing done or to be done by him to de≈øerve it; that I will rather ≈øubmit to any cen≈øure from my fellow-≈øervants, than deal ≈øo freely with my maker, as to conclude the one from the other."</p>
            <p>Rom. ix. 22, 23. "Every attentive reader will, I doubt not, infer for him≈øelf the great difference of phra≈øe, in which they who are <hi>ve≈ø≈øels of wrath,</hi> and they who are <hi>ve≈ø≈øels of mercy,</hi> are ≈øpoken of: It being ≈øaid ≈øimply of the former, that they were <hi>fitted for de≈øtruction;</hi> but of the latter, that GOD <hi>prepared them for glory.</hi> A di≈øtinction of ≈øo great im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, that I heartily wi≈øh we may ever keep it in view, to guard us again≈øt errors, on the right-hand, or on the left."</p>
            <p>Secondly, Of ≈øuch texts as ≈øpeak of God's hardening moral agents in ≈øin. A ≈øingle in≈øtance under this head may ≈øerve in≈øtead of many. The ca≈øe of Pharaoh is much in≈øi≈øted on, of whom it is repeatedly ≈øaid, that God har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened his heart.</p>
            <p>As Mr. Edward's ≈øcheme in≈øeperably connects the active and permi≈ø≈øive providence of God, ≈øo unle≈øs it can be
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:012746_0109_0F8BED5237FA6608"/>
≈øhewn that God <hi>actually effects</hi> the hardne≈øs of ≈øinners' hearts by a po≈øitive agency and influence, the ≈øcriptures produced under this head by no means help his cau≈øe. Now that God did not, could not, thus harden Pharaoh is manife≈øt from the cleare≈øt notices we have of the divine moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections. The oracles of in≈øpiration and rea≈øon in≈øtruct us, that God hath no plea≈øure in wickedne≈øs, that evil ≈øhall not dwell with him; that he is of purer eyes than to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold it‚Äîthat there is no unrighteou≈øne≈øs with him. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, let no man ≈øay when he is tempted, I am tempted of God: For God cannot be tempted with evil, neither tempteth he any man. Is God the cau≈øe of <hi>that</hi> in which he hath no plea≈øure?‚Äîto which he hath an infinite aver≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Doth he produce and effect by his po≈øitive influence <hi>that</hi> which the eyes of his purity cannot behold? Will he puni≈øh with eternal torments <hi>that</hi> which is the production of his own agency on the creature, and is there yet no un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteou≈øne≈øs with him? can the Judge of all the earth do right notwith≈øtanding? Doth he determine men to, and by his own operation effect in them, what he cannot be tempted with, nor entice his creatures to perpetrate? In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, to effect by his power and influence ≈øuch di≈øpo≈øiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and actions in the creature as involve all moral turpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, is more than merely to <hi>tempt</hi> moral agents. They may be tempted, and re≈øi≈øt the tempter. But to ≈øay ≈øuch di≈øpo≈øitions and actions are produced in them by the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gency of the Deity him≈øelf, is to charge him, not merely with being acce≈ø≈øary to, but the author of, what we call ≈øin in the creatures. It mu≈øt forever be impo≈ø≈øible to ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate the moral turpitude of ≈øuch di≈øpo≈øitions and actions from the producer or efficient of them. The ≈øcheme of nece≈ø≈øity excludes, indeed, the po≈ø≈øibility of ≈øin. For ≈øin is oppo≈øition to the will of God. But ≈øuppo≈øe creatures determined thereto by divine efficiency, this "would ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther be a mere pa≈ø≈øive obedience to the will of God, or an active compliance with it; but neither way a contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to it."</p>
            <p>If then God could not harden Pharaoh by a po≈øitive in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence and efficiency, it remains that he hardened him no otherwi≈øe than by ≈øuffering or permitting him to harden
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:012746_0110_0F8BED5488994F28"/>
him≈øelf not interpo≈øing by an irre≈øi≈øtible influence to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent his obduration‚Äîor withdrawing divine influence and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance from him after enduring him with much long-≈øuffering, and u≈øing various means to humble and reform him. The riches of divine goodne≈øs and forbearance, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended and calculated to lead him to repentance, hardened Pharaoh, as evidently appears from the ≈øcripture account of this matter. Agreably we read, P≈øalm lxxxi. 11, 12. But my people would not hearken to my voice, and I≈øra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>el would none of me. SO I gave them up unto their own hearts' lu≈øt; and they walked in their own coun≈øel.</p>
            <p>Worthy of remark is the note in Mr. Pool, on Exod. ix. 12. <hi>In quinque precedentibus plagis,</hi> &amp;c. In the five fir≈øt plagues, the hardening of Pharaoh's heart is a≈øcribed to him≈øelf; in the five la≈øt, to God. As many times as he hardened his own heart, God hardened it for puni≈øhment. (Lightfoot's Spicilegium.)</p>
            <p>The ≈øuppo≈øition of the divine agency in the obduration of ≈øinners, is, upon the whole, incapable of ≈øupport from the ≈øacred writings. So gro≈øs a contradiction to rea≈øon, ≈øo glaring a repugnancy to the general doctrine of the bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, ≈øo bla≈øphemous a reflection on the divine author of the ≈øcripture, is implied herein, that it is not a little a≈øtoni≈øh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any per≈øons who have a veneration for either ≈øhould embrace a ≈øcheme of doctrine which contains it, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to defend ≈øuch ≈øcheme by the word of God. It leaves no room for a difference between phy≈øical and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral nece≈ø≈øity. It ≈øuppo≈øeth that God may deceive us. For it is allowed that we act with the conviction of being free agents, and that the ≈øcriptures con≈øider and treat us as ≈øuch; when in truth we are nece≈ø≈øary agents, all our voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and actions being determined by divine agency. <q>One writer affirms, that though man is a nece≈ø≈øary a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, having all his actions determined by fixed and immutable laws; yet this is concealed from him‚ÄîWho conceals it? Does the author of nature conceal it, and this writer di≈øcover it? What deference is not due to the judgment of a metaphy≈øician, who≈øe ≈øagacity is ≈øo irre≈øi≈øtibly (I had almo≈øt ≈øaid omnipotently) penetrat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing! But, good ≈øir, as you are powerful, you ≈øhould have been merciful. It was not kind to rob poor mortals of

this crumb of comfort which had been provided for them in their ignorance; nor generous to publi≈øh ≈øo openly the ≈øecrets of heaven, and ≈øo bafflle the de≈øigns of providence by a few ≈øtrokes of your pen.

Whether moral evil is really for the be≈øt‚Äîe≈øpecial<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly whether it be ≈øo in that way which the ≈øcheme of nece≈ø≈øity ≈øuppo≈øeth, has been already examined. (Section VI.) And what was offered on this head has in a good mea≈øure ≈øuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øeded the occa≈øion for a particular reply to the texts pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced here. Jo≈øeph's being ≈øold by his brethren, and the crucifiction of Chri≈øt, are particularly alledged as proofs from ≈øcripture of the be≈øtne≈øs of moral evil.</p>
            <p>It is granted, that the wi≈ødom of divine providence is many times con≈øpicuous in bringing good out of evil‚Äî particularly in the in≈øtances mentioned, over-ruling for great and important good, what was in its own nature, and in the intention of the authors thereof, exceeding vile. The means wicked men and devils employ to bring to pa≈øs their devices, under the ≈øuperintendency of the wi≈øe and gracious governor of the world, are made to an≈øwer bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial purpo≈øes, which they thought not of, and contrary to their de≈øigns. He taketh the wi≈øe in their own crafti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs, and carrieth headlong the coun≈øel of the froward. But what is this to the purpo≈øe of proving, that their wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edne≈øs is for the be≈øt? How doth it hence appear to be be≈øt, that God ≈øhould <hi>effect</hi> this wickedne≈øs by his own agency. Unle≈øs this con≈øequence is ≈øhewn to follow, it will be remembred, that the in≈øtances refered to prove no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to <hi>their</hi> purpo≈øe who maintain the nece≈ø≈øity of moral evil. It may be be≈øt God ≈øhould not interpo≈øe to over-rule and nece≈ø≈øitate the wills of moral agents; and yet it might have been be≈øt that they them≈øelves had refrain'd from ≈øin. It may be be≈øt that God did not prevent the
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:012746_0112_0F8BED55F8CF0F70"/>
exi≈øtence of ≈øin by an irre≈øi≈øtible influence; while yet it might have been be≈øt had fallen angels and men never abu≈øed their liberty, but per≈øevered in virtue.</p>
            <p>That moral agents ≈øhould be nece≈ø≈øitated to be vicious, as a means of the greate≈øt holine≈øs and happine≈øs, is a ≈øtrange po≈øition.</p>
            <p>To recite ≈øcripture te≈øtimonies in oppo≈øition to this hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothe≈øis would be needle≈øs, the whole tenor of the bible being in direct contradiction to it. When the ≈øcriptures de≈øcribe ≈øin as the accur≈øed thing, which ≈øeperates the crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from the Creator‚Äîthe root of all bitterne≈øs‚Äîthe ruin of individuals and communities‚Äîthe wages whereof is death temporal and eternal‚ÄîShall any undertake to ≈øhew, notwith≈øtanding, that it is for the good of the world‚Äîa means of advancing the divine glory, and therefore the production of his power‚Äîand attempt to ≈øupport ≈øuch a doctrine by the oracles of truth? In order to this, they mu≈øt prove from the≈øe oracles, that God prefereth ≈øin to holine≈øs‚Äîthat the apo≈øtacy of men and angels will be mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of eternal prai≈øe in heaven‚Äîthat we ≈øhould ≈øin greedily, that grace may abound‚Äîthat ≈øin is not oppo≈øite to the will of God, nor to his moral rectitude‚Äîthat the lea≈øt ≈øin is yet infinitely oppo≈øite to God, and therefore an infinite evil‚Äîthat infinite evil infinitely promotes God's glory, and therefore is an infinite good‚Äîthat his wi≈ødom and holine≈øs require he ≈øhould be concern'd in it by an efficient decree and active providence‚Äîthat the divine influence and agen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy are alike concern'd in the vices as in the virtues of his creatures.‚ÄîWhen the≈øe and ≈øimilar difficulties are cleared up, it will be ≈øoon enough to an≈øwer arguments, formed from texts of ≈øcripture to prove, that moral evil is for the good of the univer≈øe, through divine efficiency.</p>
            <p>In the next ≈øucceeding ≈øection, ≈øome things will be of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, which may be applied in this place. We only add here, that while the friends of revelation exhibit ≈øuch an idea of it, its enemies triumph. The author of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters on the origin of evil, proceeding on the ≈øame founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, takes occa≈øion to burle≈øque the doctrine of the go≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel in the following manner: <q>This principle of the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øity of moral evil, and its puni≈øhment, is the foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on

on which the whole fabric of the Chri≈øtian di≈øpen≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is erected; the principle it≈øelf is avowed by the author of that di≈øpen≈øation in clear and expre≈øs words: <hi>It mu≈øt needs be that offences come; but woe unto that man by whom the offence cometh:</hi> That is, it is nece≈ø≈øary to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards compleating the de≈øigns of providence, that ≈øome men ≈øhould commit crimes; but as no individual is compelled by nece≈ø≈øity to commit them, woe unto all who are thus [i. e. nece≈ø≈øarily] guilty.‚ÄîThe expediency of moral evil, ari≈øing from the nece≈ø≈øity of natural,‚Äîis a ma≈øter-key, which will, I am certain, at once unlock all the my≈øterious and perplexing doctrines of that a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mazing in≈øtitution, [Chri≈øtianity] and explain fairly, without the lea≈øt a≈ø≈øi≈øtance from <hi>theological artifice,</hi> all tho≈øe ab≈øtru≈øe ≈øpeculations of original ≈øin, grace and prede≈øtination, and vicarious puni≈øhments, which the mo≈øt learned, for want of this clue, have never yet been able to make con≈øi≈øtent with rea≈øon and common ≈øen≈øe‚Äî all evils owe their exi≈øtence ≈øolely to the nece≈ø≈øity of their own natures, by which I mean they could not po≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øibly have been prevented without the lo≈øs of ≈øome ≈øu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perior good, or the permi≈ø≈øion of ≈øome greater evil than them≈øelves.</q>

            <head>SECTION IX. Objections con≈øidered.</head>
            <p>IF the book which hath been under examination really concludes in this principle, that God is the efficient cau≈øe of ≈øin; but few of our readers will think it needful to ≈øpend much time in con≈øidering objections. Whether this appears to be the true conclu≈øion of Mr. Edwards's principles, from each of the foregoing ≈øections taken ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perately, or from the evidence exhibited in them all taken together, mu≈øt now be left to the judgment of the reader. Some of his friends acknowledge the conclu≈øion we have drawn, adopt it as a principle, and undertake to defend it.</p>
            <p>Can God then be the cau≈øe of <hi>that</hi> which is acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to be contrary to his nature, law and government? Mu≈øt it not be a fruitle≈øs employment of any man's time to attempt to make the negative more manife≈øt than it al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready is to ≈øuch as "have plain ≈øen≈øe and can follow it?" If the above-mention'd conclu≈øion is clearly fa≈øtned on Mr. Edwards, it is ≈øuch a <hi>reductio ad ab≈øurdum</hi> as mu≈øt be a full confutation of his doctrine before believers, either Chri≈øtians or Thei≈øts. Such as adopt the conclu≈øion, and undertake to vindicate it before the world, ≈øhould openly declare on the ≈øide of athei≈øm, and ≈øceptici≈øm, before they can rea≈øonably expect any reply.</p>
            <p>
               <q>But if it is taken for granted, that Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme concludes in nothing ≈øhort of the divine effici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ency in moral evil, why then is this ≈øection devoted to the con≈øideration of objections?</q> Our an≈øwer (or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>apology</hi>) is, to cut off occa≈øion from them that ≈øeek it. Though all who believe in God may well take for granted, that there can be no real weight in any rea≈øoning adduced to prove, that moral evil is an effect proceeding from him as its cau≈øe; or in any objections to the contrary principle‚Äîthat whatever ≈øubtilty and deception there may be in ≈øuch rea≈øoning and objections, there can be no va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lidity therein‚ÄîAnd though we are by no means fully ≈øa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that any objections, which can with propriety be
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:012746_0115_0F8BED583A62D2B8"/>
made on the footing of the divine agency in moral evil, merit attention; yet we ≈øhall take notice of <hi>two</hi> objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons principally, pa≈ø≈øing others which cannot ≈øo properly be made on the pre≈øent hypothe≈øis; or if they could, are le≈øs con≈øiderable. We ≈øhall, for in≈øtance, excu≈øe our≈øelves from particularly con≈øidering this objection: That to ≈øay moral agents might in any in≈øtance chu≈øe or act otherwi≈øe than they do, is to ≈øuppo≈øe an effect without a cau≈øe‚Äîan objection which has no weight, if moral agents in any ca≈øe determine them≈øelves, or are the cau≈øe of their own voliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons‚Äîas we tru≈øt hath been ≈øhewn.</p>
            <p>We ≈øhall al≈øo pretermit the objection, that the opinion of ≈øelf-determination makes the creature independent on the creator‚Äîyea, brings the creator into a ≈øtate of depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on the creature. The reader may, moreover, find the ≈øeeming weight there is in the≈øe objections removed, p. 77, 78. of the examination, in a note.</p>
            <p>It mu≈øt further be added, that ≈øome objections Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards has made to the ≈øcheme of liberty in oppo≈øition to nece≈ø≈øity are fully an≈øwered in that e≈ø≈øay of Dr. Watts's, which he had before him. Mr. Edwards hath propo≈øed the objections anew without taking notice of the pertinent an≈øwers the Dr. hath given them. If the reader will turn to the 6th ≈øection of the Doctor's e≈ø≈øay, he will there find many objections fully an≈øwered.</p>
            <p>The fir≈øt of the two objections propo≈øed to be con≈øider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and which Mr. Edwards much in≈øi≈øts on, is, That on the principles of tho≈øe who a≈ø≈øert ≈øelf-determination, <q>the will of God is infinitely cro≈ø≈øed by every act of ≈øin that happens‚Äîthat he endures what is infinitely di≈øagre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to him‚Äîinfinite grief or pain from every ≈øin</q>‚Äî that creatures have it <q>in their power to thwart and fru≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate the de≈øigns of the creator,</q> and to <q>make him infinitely the mo≈øt mi≈øerable of all beings.</q> This, he ≈øays, certainly follows, if ≈øin be not, upon the whole, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greable to the divine will, and what God chu≈øeth as part of his infinite ≈øcheme. <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 373.</note>
            </p>
            <p>To this we ≈øay, fir≈øt, It is acknowledged that moral evil is in its <hi>nature</hi> infinitely contrary to the perfections, law
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:012746_0116_0F8BED58FAB27D40"/>
and government of God. Now we may with as much rea≈øon ≈øay, he is fru≈øtrated, grieved and pained by the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>i≈øtence of it viewed in its <hi>nature,</hi> as that he chu≈øeth and is plea≈øed with it viewed in its <hi>con≈øequences</hi>‚Äîeven admitting it is for the be≈øt, all things con≈øidered, that moral evil hath taken place. So that if it follows from the opinion of ≈øelf-determination, that God is <q>infinitely cro≈ø≈øed and grieved by every individual ≈øin;</q> the ≈øame con≈øequence follows on Mr. Edwards's own principles. Should it be granted, that every act of ≈øin is, in <hi>one</hi> view of it, agreable to the will of God, what he produceth by his efficient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination; yet, in <hi>another</hi> view, it is admitted, that it is infinitely contrary and hateful to him. Doth it not then follow, on Mr. Edwards's principles, that God mu≈øt needs be infinitely pained and grieved by it, in proportion to his hatred of it? He vieweth it in its <hi>nature</hi> and <hi>tendency,</hi> as well as in its <hi>con≈øequences.</hi> Mu≈øt he not then be <q>infinitely the mo≈øt mi≈øerable of all beings, as his hatred of ≈øin is infinite?</q>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, It would be conformable to the advice of a wi≈øe man of old <note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xxvi. 4, 5.</note> to reply to ≈øuch an objection, that there are plain and po≈øitive declarations from God him≈øelf, that he is grieved and repenteth at the ≈øins of his creatures. We read, that it <hi>repented</hi> the Lord that he had made man, and it <hi>grieved him at his heart</hi>‚Äîthat he is <hi>angry</hi> with the wicked every day‚Äîthat they <hi>weary</hi> God by their iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties‚Äî<hi>vex</hi> and <hi>grieve</hi> his ≈øpirit‚Äîwalk <hi>contrary</hi> unto him. We read of his heart being <hi>turned</hi> within him, and his <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentings</hi> kindled together. Now which ≈øhall we admit for truth‚Äîthe≈øe expre≈øs and clear declarations of ≈øcripture, or the conjectural rea≈øoning on which the objection pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds? If it be ≈øaid, Such ≈øcriptures are ≈øpoken <hi>after the manner of men.</hi> The an≈øwer is, They who <hi>thus</hi> object have no right to this plea. For their own rea≈øoning (if rea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it may be called) repre≈øents that as a <hi>reality,</hi> which the Scriptures doubtle≈øs mention <hi>figuratively,</hi> and by way of accommodation to our way of conceiving things. If their notions of the ends of providence in the permi≈ø≈øion of ≈øin are not admitted as indubitable truth, they immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:012746_0117_0F8BED59B8669170"/>
infer, that the Deity mu≈øt needs be affected in the ≈øame manner that human beings are, when any of their ≈øchemes are fru≈øtrated‚Äîthat he is thwarted, pained, griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and made infinitely mi≈øerable.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, This way of objecting, to ≈øay the lea≈øt, is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly irreverent and unbecoming. It has the appearance of an inclination to bring down to a level with man that is a worm, <hi>that</hi> being who≈øe glory is above the heavens. It is treating the character and government of the LORD GOD OMNIPOTENT with le≈øs deference than is ≈øhewn to an earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly potentate. Such <hi>leveling</hi> notions introduced into reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion are of mo≈øt pernicious con≈øequence. Is the infinite God to be treated with a familiarity, which we ≈øhould ≈øcarce pre≈øume to u≈øe with a fellow-mortal, who happens to be elevated a little above us! Under a notion of doing honor to his ≈øacred name and government, ≈øhall we ≈øpeak of him as though he were <hi>altogether ≈øuch an one as our≈øelves!</hi> Shall we ≈øubject the ab≈øolutely perfect ≈øpirit to human pa≈ø≈øions and feelings! Would it be le≈øs ab≈øurd, or le≈øs pre≈øumptu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and reproachful, to ≈øuppo≈øe <hi>the Godhead like to gold, ≈øilver, or ≈øtone, graven by art and man's device?</hi> Doth it be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a creature to ≈øpeak with ≈øuch freedom of THE HIGH AND LOFTY ONE WHO INHABITETH ETERNITY, WHOSE NAME IS HOLY! Angels, who excel in ≈øtrength, and on whom he ≈øhines with the full beams of his glory, confe≈øs their ignorance in the deep things of his nature and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence. They acquie≈øce in the will of him who is won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful in coun≈øel‚Äîwho≈øe ways are pa≈øt finding out‚Äîand humbly adore his, un≈øearchable wi≈ødom in his works and admini≈øtration. Yet man, in≈øtead of imitating the≈øe ≈øons of God above, would be wi≈øe beyond the mea≈øure of his capacity, and rank in the ≈øcale of beings. With the ≈øhort line of his own rea≈øon he would fathom the aby≈øs of the Deity‚Äîand is wont to view him through the dark medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um of human prejudices and pa≈ø≈øions. Can God approve our taking the mea≈øure of his nature from our own? Can he be plea≈øed with being brought to a level with creatures, who dwell in hou≈øes of clay, and who≈øe foundation is in the du≈øt? Hath he not admoni≈øhed us, <hi>My thoughts are not your thoughts; neither are your ways my ways, ≈øaith the
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:012746_0118_0F8BED5A808072D0"/>
Lord. For as the heavens are higher than the earth, ≈øo are my ways higher than your ways, and my thoughts than your thoughts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What we have further to offer in reply to this objection will properly enough fall under the other objection refered to above; and which we ≈øhall therefore proceed to con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. The objection is this: To ≈øuppo≈øe moral evil is an effect of fire-will abu≈øed, or of internal cau≈øation in the creature, is the ≈øame as to ≈øuppo≈øe God him≈øelf the cau≈øe of it, ≈øince he tru≈øted this matter with the creature, who he knew would abu≈øe liberty. And ≈øince <q>the mo≈øt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant mea≈øures of his conduct towards mankind, all known to him from the beginning, were formed upon the ≈øuppo≈øition of the being of moral evil, which he could have prevented, how can the <hi>permi≈ø≈øion</hi> of it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øi≈øt with the moral perfections of the Deity,</q> any more than the ≈øuppo≈øition of his <hi>efficiency</hi> in it? <q>It mu≈øt eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nally be the ≈øame thing whether a Creator of infinite power and knowledge created beings originally wicked and mi≈øerable, or gave them power to make them≈øelves ≈øo, fore-knowing they would employ that power to their own de≈øtruction.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Letters on the origin of evil, p. 102.</note>
            </p>
            <p>It is indeed a di≈ømal dilemma, that God mu≈øt either for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cibly prevent wickedne≈øs, or be him≈øelf the cau≈øe of it. The former he hath not done: For it is certain that wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edne≈øs is in the world. Mu≈øt we then embrace the other part of the dilemma? Is it the mo≈øt rational way of ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counting for the exi≈øtence of ≈øin to ≈øay, that God createth beings originally wicked, of infu≈øeth wickedne≈øs into them afterwards? What relief can it be to the mind of one who really believes a God to ≈øay, that ≈øin proceeds from him as the cau≈øe? What an≈øwer can the maintainer of this principle make to the athei≈øt? For whether is better, to ≈øay there is no God? or to ≈øay there is a God indeed, but that he, and he only, is the cau≈øe of wickedne≈øs? Suppo≈øe moral evil is for the be≈øt; it is ≈øtill a mo≈øt daring a≈ø≈øertion to ≈øay, it was be≈øt the divine efficiency ≈øhould bring it into exi≈øtence.</p>
            <p>Some argue, if ≈øin is not for the be≈øt, it would certainly have been prevented, ≈øince God foreknew and might have prevented it. On the≈øe premi≈øes they conclude, that ≈øin
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:012746_0119_0F8BED5B39BDF798"/>
mu≈øt be an effect of divine operation and production.‚ÄîA con≈øequence which by no means follows; and which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volves ≈øuch impiety, that no ≈øuppo≈øeable difficulties attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the exi≈øtence of moral evil ≈øhould compel us to admit it. To embrace this con≈øequence in order to rid our≈øelves of one difficulty, would be to involve our≈øelves in a far greater‚Äîan inextricable one, ab≈øolutely irreconcileable with the moral perfections of God. And when he is rob'd of <hi>the≈øe,</hi> his glory is taken from him: The name of a Deity may be retained, but no more.</p>
            <p>On the hypothe≈øis before us, how is it po≈ø≈øible to know that God is holy? that he loves righteou≈øne≈øs, and hates wickedne≈øs? For can he hate the effects of his own pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducing‚Äîthe operation of his own power‚Äîhis own acts? By ≈øuppo≈øition all ≈øin is his act‚Äîthe fruit of his agency or efficiency. Why then is not ≈øin very good, as much as any part of the Creator's work? If the di≈øpo≈øition in aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned ≈øinners and apo≈øtate ≈øpirits, no le≈øs than the contrary temper in ≈øaints and angels, is the product of divine energy, by what rule can we determine that holine≈øs is plea≈øing, and wickedne≈øs offen≈øive, to him? Though the operations of our own minds clearly declare to us, that moral evil is contrary and odious to God; yet what el≈øe can we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude than that tho≈øe perceptions are a delu≈øion? And if our own feelings are delu≈øive, this particular impre≈ø≈øion or idea, that there is a God and moral governor, may be ≈øo. The ≈øuppo≈øition of the exi≈øtence of matter or ≈øpirit may be a delu≈øion. Our own con≈øciou≈øne≈øs may be ≈øo. We may be deluded in ≈øuppo≈øing that we our≈øelves exi≈øt, though the very ≈øuppo≈øition clearly implies our exi≈øtence. No <q>paradoxes were ever brought forth by the mo≈øt abject ≈øuper≈øtition, or the mo≈øt frantic enthu≈øia≈øm, more in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible</q> than the wi≈ødom of the pre≈øent age hath pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. To ≈øuppo≈øe that the alwi≈øe Creator and governor of the world effects by his own agency what is infinitely repugnant to his pure and holy nature, is as marvellous a paradox as was ever publi≈øhed. We might rather ≈øay, that his wi≈ødom required all rebels ≈øhould peri≈øh everla≈øtingly, than ≈øay, that an holy God fir≈øt effected by his own ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy their rebellion, as the medium of di≈øplaying his own
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:012746_0120_0F8BED5C2E9C7EC0"/>
perfections and communicating the greate≈øt happine≈øs to the univer≈øal ≈øy≈øtem. We might with as much appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of rea≈øon ≈øay, that the happine≈øs of the univer≈øe is not the care of the infinite Creator and parent of it, as ≈øay, that he produceth moral evil as a nece≈ø≈øary means of this happine≈øs. As well might we ≈øay, that wi≈ødom required God ≈øhould not create the worlds‚Äî≈øhould not form crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures capable of moral evil. What weight, then, ≈øhould be allowed to objections which proceed on a ≈øuppo≈øition ≈øo reproachful to that being who≈øe work is perfect‚Äî? a God of truth, and without iniquity? A ≈øcheme founded in a principle ≈øo horrible, ≈øo ≈øhockingly ab≈øurd and impious as this, that an holy, wi≈øe and good God is at the ≈øame time the efficient of ≈øin, and an avenger to execute wrath upon the ≈øubjects of it, neither demands, nor will admit any other an≈øwer than that in the book, of Job, <hi>Far be it from God that he ≈øhould do wickedne≈øs, and from the Almighty, that he ≈øhould commit iniquity.</hi> No man ≈øhould ≈øuffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf to be in the lea≈øt ≈øtaggered by objections formed on the ≈øuppo≈øition of the truth of ≈øuch a ≈øcheme, whether he is able di≈øtinctly to an≈øwer the objections or not. An at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to ≈øupport ≈øuch a ≈øcheme de≈øerves to be rejected with contempt and abhorrence. No po≈ø≈øible objections founded on ≈øuch a ba≈øis can have any weight by rea≈øon of the TERRIBILITY of the hypothe≈øis it≈øelf. The public will not think there is occa≈øion for, or even propriety in, taking up time to con≈øider objections ≈øtated on this ba≈øis.

            <p>"Let it be more particularly con≈øidered, fir≈øt, that perhaps there is not, nor can be, any being of a limited under≈øtanding above the po≈ø≈øibility of being mi≈øled in its moral conduct; and all the orders of created free agents mu≈øt naturally be in a ≈øtate of trial, till by a right u≈øe of liberty their integrity is confirmed‚ÄîEvery imperfect a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent, having a variety in his frame, mu≈øt have propen≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to particular objects which are adapted to the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of his condition; which propen≈øions in a regular moral con≈øtitution, are under the government of con≈øci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but their being does not depend upon it.

            <p>"Here then is a tendency or temptation to evil, from which the creature by the right u≈øe of its own powers may e≈øcape, and thereby be more confirmed in virtue; but a po≈ø≈øibility of falling and corrupting it≈øelf ≈øeems to be in≈øeperable from every finite nature; and even the danger of it ≈øeems naturally to attend the ≈øtate of all finite moral agents, during ≈øome part of their exi≈øtence‚ÄîWe know that we are capable both of doing right and wrong; and our moral powers ≈øo con≈øtituted, with ≈øuch a freedom, we cannot help thinking a very high privilege; whereby we are rai≈øed above the condition of many other beings, and have the e≈ø≈øential foundation of noble enjoyments."</p>
            <p>"Secondly, The human mind nece≈ø≈øarily appears to it≈øelf the cau≈øe both of the moral good and evil which is done by it‚ÄîThe capacity is derived wholly from God, and is pre≈øerved by him; the particular determination is from our≈øelves; only influenced, ≈øo far as is con≈øi≈øtent with our free agency, by ≈øetting before us ≈øufficient mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives to good.

            <p>"Fourthly, It mu≈øt be acknowledged that, ≈øtrictly ≈øpeaking, God‚Äîcould have created moral agents much more perfect than men are; given them a greater mea≈øure of knowledge; ≈øet the motives of virtue in ≈øo ≈øtrong a light before them, as more effectually to ≈øecure their attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to it‚Äîcould have placed them in a ≈øtate much more free from temptations, and con≈øequently in le≈øs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of making detection‚Äîcould have prevented the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juncture of circum≈øtances in which he fore≈øaw liberty could be abu≈øed.

            <p>It may be ≈øubmitted to public con≈øideration, whether fir≈øt principles can, without danger, be brought to the te≈øt of metaphy≈øics. The being of a God we call one of the≈øe principles; the immediate con≈øciou≈øne≈øs mankind have of liberty and accountablene≈øs, another; and ≈øince the ≈øuppo≈øition that God is the cau≈øe of ≈øin wholly robs him of his moral character, we venture to add, that the negative of this is another fir≈øt principle. The works of creation without us, and the witne≈øs for God within us, in≈øtantly atte≈øt the truth in the≈øe points, as ≈øoon as they are mentioned. 'Tis very que≈øtionable whether metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øics have been, or can be, u≈øed to any advantage, on the≈øe manife≈øt points, even again≈øt the ≈øophi≈øtry of infi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dels. We ≈øee not why a philo≈øopher and metaphy≈øician is not obliged to take up with that evidence here which affords clear conviction to men of plain under≈øtanding. When believers in God have refered the ≈øophi≈øtical rea≈øon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er again≈øt his being and perfections to that inconte≈øtible proof of them which the vi≈øible world exhibits, they have done their duty‚Äîall that is required, or that can indeed be done. Ab≈øtract rea≈øoning, it may be pre≈øumed, will afford no conviction, where the con≈øtant atte≈øtations to the being of a God in creation and providence do not. The oppo≈øing metaphy≈øics to metaphy≈øics will keep the infidel in countenance. It is an intimation to him, that he has ≈øome rea≈øon for his incredulity. For he pretty naturally concludes, that the being of a God would not be brought into the field of debate by tho≈øe who believe it, were there not ≈øome rea≈øon to doubt it. Principles manife≈øt on fir≈øt propo≈øal, if men will open their eyes, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther need nor can receive any a≈ø≈øi≈øtance from metaphy≈øics; and tho≈øe who would make them undergo the peril of a metaphy≈øical ≈øcrutiny may find they have expo≈øed them to be rejected.</p>
            <p>The other two principles mentioned <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>„Äà‚Ä¶„Äâ</desc>

as the being of a God, and require no metaphy≈øical proof‚Äî viz. God cannot be tempted with evil, and tempteth no man; (or, in other words, is not the cau≈øe of ≈øin;) and that mankind are not nece≈ø≈øitated or de≈øtined to chu≈øe and act in every in≈øtance as they do, but might chu≈øe and act otherwi≈øe‚Äî at lea≈øt in ≈øome in≈øtances. Metaphy≈øics have been ≈øo far from ≈øtrengthening the evidence of the≈øe ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious truths, that, on the contrary, hereby they have been perplexed and made dubious‚Äîyea, ≈øome ≈øeem to think they have demon≈øtrated them to be fal≈øe.</p>
            <p>Not one in an hundred of mankind can apprehend a metaphy≈øical proof of religion‚Äîa ≈øubject in which all ranks are alike intere≈øted. Common people are, indeed much better phy≈øicians, than metaphy≈øicians. Nor is every good natural Philo≈øopher ≈økilled in moral philo≈øophy or ver≈øed in the ab≈øtract nature of immaterial beings. It is ≈øometimes ≈øaid, that phy≈øic oftner kills than cures. Such is metaphy≈øic to the mind. Where it prevents or removes a ≈ølight moral indi≈øpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øition in one in≈øtance, it probably brings on a fatal di≈øtem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per in more in≈øtances. Nor is a corro≈øive ever eligible, when a lenitive will an≈øwer the end.</p>
            <p>The plaine≈øt and mo≈øt important principles of revelation would not endure a metaphy≈øical di≈øqui≈øition. At lea≈øt, the ≈øacred writers have not u≈øed ≈øuch rea≈øoning‚Äînot tho≈øe of them who were be≈øt able to rea≈øon in this manner. Mo≈øes, I≈øaiah, Ezekiel and St. Paul have not. Unparralleled ≈øam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of <hi>eloquence</hi> and <hi>the ≈øublime</hi> have been often produced from their writings; but we don't call to mind that any in≈øtances of their <hi>metaphy≈øical</hi> rea≈øoning have been adduced. In≈øtances of ≈øtrong rea≈øoning their writings abound with particularly St. Paul's. But he di≈øclaims metaphy≈øics‚Äînot ≈øurely as being above his abilities; but as of no u≈øe on the mo≈øt e≈ø≈øential point of religion‚Äîrather injurious than helpful. As he is the principal new-te≈øtament writer, we beg leave to make a few ≈øtrictures on his character and writings, with a more immediate view to the ≈øubject of the pre≈øent ≈øection.</p>
            <p>He was po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of an "amazing force of genius, as well as invincible courage, and a ≈øpirit of patience, which no fatigue could overcome, and which no ≈øufferings or trials could <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">

and able to combat the Jewi≈øh doctors and Pagan philo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øophers with their own arms." <note n="*" place="bottom">Mo≈øheim, Vol. I. P. 25.</note> His noble birth, added to his natural genius, literary acquirements, ardent zeal and un≈øhaken firmne≈øs of mind, ≈øeemed, even <hi>in the eye of the world,</hi> to qualify him for a principal in≈øtrument in the defence and propagation of the go≈øpel. Did then the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor of Chri≈øtianity, in the appointment of St. Paul to this bu≈øine≈øs, proceed on maxims of worldly wi≈ødom? By no means. The≈øe accompli≈øhments, which di≈øtingui≈øhed St. Paul from his fellow-apo≈øtles, were the mo≈øt powerful ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtacles to his embracing Chri≈øtianity. They were em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to root out the go≈øpel. No one per≈øecuted it more furiou≈øly than he‚Äîno one de≈øpi≈øed it more. But when it plea≈øed God <hi>to reveal his Son in him,</hi> his ≈øhining talents were fervently applied to the purpo≈øe for which they were given, and became eminently ≈øub≈øervient to the further<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of the faith, which once he de≈øtroyed. Let us reflect a moment in what manner he u≈øed them as an apo≈øtle of Chri≈øt‚Äîas his example is for ≈øucceeding mini≈øters.</p>
            <p>Here we have many ≈øtriking in≈øtances of his zeal, elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence and rea≈øoning. We mean to take notice of the la≈øt more e≈øpecially‚Äîhis rea≈øoning with Jewi≈øh doctors and pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan philo≈øophers‚Äîon the principles of natural religion, and the revelations of God to the Jews. He well knew what expectations of a magnificent temporal prince the doctors of the law had rai≈øed in mankind‚Äîhow oppo≈øite the Chri≈øtian ≈øy≈øtem was to the reigning philo≈øophy of the world‚Äîparticularly what exception the pride of the Gre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian philo≈øophers took to it on account of its plainne≈øs and ≈øimplicity. He would naturally al≈øo call to mind his own prejudices again≈øt the go≈øpel on the≈øe accounts. And as he had frequent occa≈øion to confer with men of this character at Jeru≈øalem, Rome, Athens and Corinth, it may be worth while to enquire in what manner he rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoned with them? Metaphy≈øical rea≈øoning would have been be≈øt accommodated to their ta≈øte: And if ever there is a propriety in introducing this kind of rea≈øoning into reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, Paul had occa≈øion for it, and was able to manage it to advantage. It might particularly be conjectured, that
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:012746_0127_0F8BED62B8BBBE20"/>
a man of Paul's learning would have offered a laboured di≈ø≈øertation on the ab≈øtract nature of the ≈øupreme ≈øpirit, (which would have been rea≈øoning metaphy≈øically) when encountered by the learned philo≈øophers from among the Epicureans and Stoics; when accu≈øed of being a ≈øetter forth of ≈øtrange gods‚Äîwhen brought unto Areopagus‚Äî ≈øurrounded by philo≈øophers, ≈øenators and plebeians‚Äîunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking to convince them of their ≈øuper≈øtition, and reclaim them from their idolatry. But to lead them to the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the true God, (their ignorance of whom was proclaimed in the in≈øcription on one of their altars) what method did he take? Ob≈øervable to this purpo≈øe is his ≈øpeech, while he ≈øtood in the mid≈øt of Mars-hill. <q>Ye men of Athens, I perceive that in all things ye are too ≈øuper≈øtitious‚ÄîGod that made the world, and all things therein, ≈øeeing that he is Lord of heaven and earth, dwelleth not in temples made with hands: Neither is wor≈øhiped with mens hands, as though he needed any thing; ≈øeeing he giveth to all life, and breath and all things.</q>
            </p>
            <p>How plain, and yet how forceable, is this rea≈øoning?‚Äî adapted equally to wi≈øe and unwi≈øe. He does not di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour≈øe as a philo≈øopher would on the nature of ≈øpirit ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtracted from matter, but makes a familiar appeal to the works of vi≈øible creation and providence, in proof of the exi≈øtence and perfection of God, and thence infers the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countablene≈øs of mankind to him, as moral governor and judge. This was to rea≈øon as became a mini≈øter of that ma≈øter who ≈øent him not to preach with wi≈ødom of words.</p>
            <p>To the ≈øame purpo≈øe he ob≈øerves, that the works of vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øible nature, and particularly the operations of their own minds, ≈øhould have been regarded by the pagan Romans as demon≈øtrable proofs of the being, attributes and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God‚Äîthat their not being induced to glorify him as God, on this clear evidence, was ≈øo far from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any argument of their ≈øuperior wi≈ødom, that, on the contrary, it proved them inexcu≈øeable and fools, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding all their profe≈ø≈øions of wi≈ødom. <note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">Rom. i. 19, 20; 22. ch. ii. 14, 15.</note> In like manner he ≈øays, God left not him≈øelf without witne≈øs among the

            </p>
            <p>The≈øe in≈øtances are examples of Paul's rea≈øoning with Pagan idolaters. He argues from the works of creation and providence, which lie open alike to learned and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>learned. Here is no ab≈øtract, metaphy≈øical rea≈øoning‚Äî all is ea≈øy to be under≈øtood.

            <p>When he treated with the Jewi≈øh doctors, or the people of I≈ørael, he did not (as before heathen) recur to the works of nature; but taking the principles of natural religion for granted, he rea≈øoned with them out of tho≈øe ≈øcriptures, which they acknowledged were given by in≈øpiration of God. And though all his writings di≈øcover the good rea≈øoner, as well as the good man, full of the holy Gho≈øt; yet we do not recollect that he rea≈øoned metaphy≈øically, either before Jews or heathen‚ÄîGreat plainne≈øs of ≈øpeech ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears in all his rea≈øonings, as became a mini≈øter of the new te≈øtament. <note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">11 Cor. iii. 12.</note> He was not a≈øhamed of the go≈øpel of Chri≈øt before the Jewi≈øh Rabbi's or pagan philo≈øophers, although it's di≈øtingui≈øhing doctrine was to the former a ≈øtumbling block, and to the latter fooli≈øhne≈øs.

Upon the whole he declares, that the world by wi≈ødom knew not God‚Äîthat what the pride of philo≈øophy ≈øtigmatized as the fooli≈øhne≈øs of preaching, was the ≈øcheme infinite wi≈ødom had determined upon for the ≈øalvation of believers‚Äîthat the fooli≈øhne≈øs of God was wi≈øer than men, and the weakne≈øs of God ≈øtronger than men.‚ÄîThus was fulfilled what was foretold, <q>I will de≈øtroy the wi≈ødom of the wi≈øe, and will bring to nothing the under≈øtanding of the prudent. Where is the wi≈øe? where is the ≈øcribe? where is the di≈øputer of this world? hath not GOD made fooli≈øh the wi≈ødom of this world?</q>

            <p>From what has been ob≈øerved it appears, that the chief of the apo≈øtles, notwith≈øtanding his learning, was ≈øo far from making u≈øe of metaphy≈øical rea≈øoning in treating with tho≈øe who believed the go≈øpel, that he made no u≈øe of it for the conviction of infidels, either among Jews or heathen‚Äîthat he rather di≈øclaimed it as dangerous, than patronized it as helpful, to the cau≈øe of truth. Speaking of his own mini≈øtry, and that of his fellow-apo≈øtles, he ≈øaith, We ≈øpeak not as plea≈øing men, but God who trieth our hearts.

            <p>But it is more than time to remind the reader what im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement Mr. Edwards hath made of metaphy≈øical rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øoning. This we ≈øhall do by adducing a number of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtances, which may ≈øerve to ≈øhew the precariou≈øne≈øs, ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty and danger of ≈øuch rea≈øoning. All the argumentati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of his book really concludes in this, that God is the cau≈øe of ≈øin. This is the capital error, which, we tru≈øt, a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øing people will never admit. And though he doth not acknowledge it, yet it mu≈øt be embraced if his foundation be firm. The following ≈øpecimen may ≈øhew, that his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clu≈øions are by no means fairly drawn from his premi≈øes‚Äî or that one or the other are fal≈øe.</p>
            <p>Becau≈øe inert matter cannot begin or alter its own mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; hence Mr. Edwards infers, that an intelligent ≈øpirit can in no ca≈øe begin or alter its own volitions and actions.</p>
            <p>If there can be no effect without a cau≈øe; he infers, that there can be no principle of efficiency in moral agents.</p>
            <p>If a moral agent is ≈øuppo≈øed to determine his own voli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; then he infers, that the act of volition it≈øelf is ≈øelf-determined, and hath no cau≈øe.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="134" facs="unknown:012746_0131_0F8BED6767DC21D0"/>He takes for granted, that volition, even with re≈øpect to the mo≈øt ca≈øual thing, is an act of preference; and then concludes, that, in the mo≈øt indifferent thing, there mu≈øt be an apparent rea≈øon for willing as we do rather than otherwi≈øe.</p>
            <p>Becau≈øe a perfect equilibrium or ab≈øolute indifference is not e≈ø≈øential to liberty; he concludes, that a power to chu≈øe one thing or its oppo≈øite is incompatible with liberty.</p>
            <p>If every moral volition hath ≈øome motive, then that motive is the cau≈øe of the volition‚Äîand therefore moral agents them≈øelves are not the cau≈øe.</p>
            <p>Becau≈øe a thing is in our power, if con≈øequent to our election; therefore it is in our power, though the election of it is not.</p>
            <p>Becau≈øe the oppo≈øition of one's will to what is required, may be no excu≈øe; therefore the want of a power to be willing is none.</p>
            <p>(His rea≈øoning on ≈øelf-determination may be well ≈øum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med up thus: Becau≈øe a man cannot take the ≈øecond ≈øtep without the fir≈øt; therefore he cannot take the fir≈øt without a previous one.)</p>
            <p>Becau≈øe Adam's lap≈øe may be the ≈øource of a blameable impotency in his po≈øterity; therefore original impotency in him≈øelf might be blameable.</p>
            <p>Becau≈øe the e≈ø≈øence of ≈øin lies in its nature; therefore the doer of wickedne≈øs is not the cau≈øe of it‚Äîand therefore it is no reproach to ≈øay, that God is the cau≈øe of ≈øin.</p>
            <p>It is laid down for a principle, that a creature never commits ≈øin till divine influence and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn; hence it is infered (not unju≈øtly, if the principle a≈ø≈øumed be true) that man's fir≈øt apo≈øtacy was owing to the want or withdraw of divine influence and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance.</p>
            <p>Becau≈øe natural (or nece≈ø≈øary) effects, and moral habits of holine≈øs, proceed from the po≈øitive influence and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Deity; therefore moral evil doth.</p>
            <p>Becau≈øe God is nece≈ø≈øarily holy, &amp;c. therefore the holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne≈øs or pollution of creatures is nece≈ø≈øary‚Äîtherefore a real and original nece≈ø≈øity of ≈øin is con≈øi≈øtent with blame and puni≈øhment.</p>
            <p>Becau≈øe God permits ≈øinners to harden them≈øelves;
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:012746_0132_0F8BED67F95C3828"/>
therefore their obduracy is the effect of his ordination, di≈øpo≈øal and determination, as the cau≈øe.</p>
            <p>Becau≈øe God certainly foreknows the ≈øinful volitions and actions of his creatures; therefore they are nece≈ø≈øary ‚Äîtherefore they proceed from his efficient determination.</p>
            <p>If we are not certain ≈øin is not for the be≈øt; then we are certain it is for the be≈øt.</p>
            <p>Becau≈øe God brings good out of moral evil; therefore it is be≈øt‚Äîtherefore it is a nece≈ø≈øary means of the greate≈øt good‚Äîtherefore it is part of the divine plan‚Äîtherefore the divine perfections could not have been manife≈øted, had not ≈øin entred the world‚Äîtherefore glorified intelligences are pre≈øerved in their allegiance through terror of the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ni≈øhment of the damned‚Äîtherefore what is infinitely op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øite to the divine nature, law and government is not contrary, but agreeable, to his will‚Äîtherefore God is the efficient cau≈øe of ≈øin, and infinitely plea≈øed with the great good it brings to the world, otherwi≈øe he would have pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented it. <note n="*" place="bottom">

            <head>SECTION XI. Recapitulation.</head>
            <p>MR. Edwards's book was wrote with a view to ≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vert the opinion of ≈øelf-determination, and e≈øta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bli≈øh the doctrine of univer≈øal nece≈ø≈øity. He endeavoreth to prove, that the volitions and actions of moral agents have a like dependence on a cau≈øe without them≈øelves as effects in the natural world‚Äîthat all events, from the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the world to the end, are unalterably, unavoid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably and circum≈øtantially determined. And while he teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth, that this nece≈ø≈øity, in reference to moral events, is of the moral kind, and therefore ≈øuppo≈øeth it con≈øi≈øtent with the mo≈øt perfect liberty, he yet maintains that moral acti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are all ≈øubject to an original real nece≈ø≈øity as ab≈øolute as natural.</p>
            <p>In ≈øupport of this general ≈øy≈øtem, he ≈øets him≈øelf to ≈øhew, What determines the will? and it is particularly and very largely in≈øi≈øted, as a thing of chief importance, that the will is always determined by the highe≈øt motive, or by what appears mo≈øt agreable to the mind; which is called a moral cau≈øe, and the determination of the will hereby a nece≈ø≈øary determination.</p>
            <p>Three things have been propo≈øed in the examination of this ≈øy≈øtem. Fir≈øt, An enquiry into the ≈øuppo≈øed connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of volition with the highe≈øt motive. Secondly, The indi≈ø≈øoluble connection of moral cau≈øes and effects. And thirdly, An attempt to ≈øhew, that internal, moral liberty, as di≈øtingui≈øhed from external or animal, belongs to moral agents‚Äîthat Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme of nece≈ø≈øity, if admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in theory, is not applicable to practice.</p>
            <p>Under the fir≈øt of the≈øe heads, it was ≈øhewn, that if the highe≈øt motive were allowed to be the <hi>next</hi> and <hi>immediate</hi> cau≈øe of volition, this is no re≈øolution of the que≈øtion, as it doth not ≈øhew the <hi>original</hi> and <hi>true</hi> cau≈øe thereof. The enquiry is not pur≈øued to the end, the <hi>foundation</hi> of the will's determination is not di≈øcovered. What it is that gives cau≈øal influence to motive, or wherein its energy
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:012746_0135_0F8BED6A38B230D0"/>
con≈øi≈øts, remains ≈øtill to be pointed out. But it was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to be proved, in the next place, by various con≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, and particularly from Mr. Edwards's own au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and rea≈øoning, that in truth the ≈øtronge≈øt motive is not the moral cau≈øe of volition, and that there is no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ce≈ø≈øary coincidence between the one and the other. And la≈øtly, that volition is not the proper cau≈øe of external action, any more than the highe≈øt motive is of volition.</p>
            <p>After the mention of ≈øome preliminary principles, it was enquired, under the next head of the propo≈øed exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination, whether the wills of moral agents are nece≈ø≈øarily determined by an extrin≈øic, or by an intrin≈øic cau≈øe, and whether there can be natural liberty without moral, on Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme. This ≈øcheme was repre≈øented as making God the author of ≈øin, by plain and direct con≈øequence‚Äîthe ≈øuppo≈øed advantage of ≈øin to the univer≈øe was briefly noticed; and general ob≈øervations &amp; reflections ≈øubjoined, with a view to make it manife≈øt, that if no being can, or ever could, chu≈øe or act otherwi≈øe in any ca≈øe, 'tis very immaterial by what name this nece≈ø≈øity is called, ≈øince a nece≈ø≈øity more ab≈øolute cannot be conceived of‚Äîthat the runing up mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral events, like natural, through a chain of ≈øecond cau≈øes to the fir≈øt, is confounding the agency of intelligent crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures with mechani≈øm‚Äîmaking their volitions and conduct the agency of the Deity, properly ≈øpeaking‚Äîor rather, that, upon the principles of Mr. Edwards, the Deity him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf is not an agent, but an in≈øtrument of nece≈ø≈øity and fate. There is no ≈øelf-mover‚Äîdirection‚Äîdetermination, or ≈øource of activity, in the univer≈øe. Wherein our author profe≈ø≈øeth him≈øelf a friend of liberty, he either contradicts his own principles, or allows of no liberty that is of any moment, or at all connected with moral agency.</p>
            <p>We endeavoured, under the la≈øt branch of our general de≈øign, to exhibit a ≈øcheme more con≈øonant to rea≈øon and truth; ≈øhewing from the di≈øcernment that di≈øtingui≈øheth moral agents from the brute-creation, and their capacity of chu≈øing and acting otherwi≈øe than they in fact do, that internal moral liberty and ≈øelf-determination belong to them‚Äîthat it no way interferes with this liberty to admit the exhibition and influence of motives in moral volitions.
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:012746_0136_0F8BED6AFA4F42E8"/>
The ≈øcheme of nece≈ø≈øity exhibited in Mr. Edwards's book, if true in ≈øpeculation, was, upon the whole, ≈øhewn to be fal≈øe in its practical application‚Äîof mo≈øt dangerous ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency and con≈øequence. A ≈øpecimen was al≈øo annexed of Mr. Edwards's agreeing, in his leading ≈øentiments, with antient and modern fatali≈øts.</p>
            <p>This is a view of the ≈øubject ≈øo far as it was con≈øidered in our former publication. In the pre≈øent, the ≈øame gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral de≈øign has been re≈øumed and continued. A further proof of ≈øelf-determination hath been adduced from the capacity in moral agents of deliberating, ≈øu≈øpending, &amp;c.‚Äî the di≈øtinction of rational agency from animal has been ≈øtated‚Äîa di≈øtinction entirely confounded in Mr. Edwards's book, which has been further ≈øhewn to contain a full de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial of moral liberty. It has been argued, that events in the moral world are not <hi>uniform,</hi> as in the material‚Äîthat the Deity mu≈øt be the efficient cau≈øe of moral evil, or it hath no ≈øuch cau≈øe, unle≈øs ≈øelf-determination be admitted‚Äî that motives do not nece≈ø≈øitate, nor are the cau≈øe of voliti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, which hath a moral per≈øon or agent for its cau≈øe. The di≈øtinction of natural and moral nece≈ø≈øity hath been parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly attended to, and, in Mr. Edwards's u≈øe of it, ≈øhewn to be groundle≈øs; ≈øince, if he means any thing, a ≈øtrict and ab≈øolute nece≈ø≈øity is equally intended by the former as by the latter‚Äîwe have touched the argument from the nece≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the divine moral rectitude, and pre≈øume it was made to appear, that there is no infering herefrom a ≈øtrict nece≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øity in the moral volitions and actions of creatures. From Mr. Edwards's notion of nece≈ø≈øity, it follows, that God is the author or cau≈øe of ≈øin, or it hath no cau≈øe. This ≈øame conclu≈øion has further been ≈øhewn to follow from his plan of the origin of evil, which we have di≈øtinctly examined‚Äîa plan which, indeed, renders the exi≈øtence of ≈øin forever impo≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. His hypothe≈øis, which derives moral evil from the withdraw of divine influence and a≈ø≈øi≈øtance, has been ≈øhewn not to differ materially, either from theirs who explicitly a≈øcribe it to divine efficiency, or from theirs who ≈øuppo≈øe God might make creatures originally vicious. The only con≈øi≈øtent hypothe≈øis is that which derives evil from the abu≈øe of moral liberty. The di≈øtinction of the e≈ø≈øence of
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:012746_0137_0F8BED6BB8FCBAD8"/>
virtue and vice from their cau≈øe, has, we flatter our≈øelves, been evinced to be futile and eva≈øive, by no means to an≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer Mr. Edwards's purpo≈øe, however important he e≈øteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, and how much ≈øoever his principles required it. It has been con≈øidered, whether moral evil is indeed be≈øt for the world; or ≈øuppo≈øe it is, whether it be be≈øt that God ≈øhould effect it by his agency. We have al≈øo examined the argument from divine pre≈øcience, and particularly ≈øhewn, that the certainty of moral events is altogether different from nece≈ø≈øity, the former not affecting their nature, or the manner of their coming to pa≈øs, or any way influencing them, as the latter doth‚Äîthat pre≈øcience ≈øtands not in the relation of cau≈øe to the things foreknown. Texts of ≈øcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture u≈øually alledged in ≈øupport of the ≈øcheme of nece≈ø≈øity have been ≈øhewn to be mi≈øcon≈øtrued. A reply has been made to ≈øome principal objections, and a di≈ø≈øertation ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded on metaphy≈øical rea≈øoning, ≈øhewing that it rather ≈øerves to bewilder than elucidate the pre≈øent ≈øubject. We have, therefore, made but little u≈øe of it; although it has in ≈øome mea≈øure been evinced, (as we ≈øuppo≈øe) in the cour≈øe of our examination, that the metaphy≈øician is ea≈øily repul≈øed with his own weapons.</p>
            <p>In the examination ≈øome arguments were touched, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong many which occur'd, evincing the a≈øpect Mr. Ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards's ≈øcheme hath on the moral perfections and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God, and its con≈øequent practical tendency. O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther arguments have been now mentioned with the ≈øame view. The oppo≈øite truth was there exhibited in part; we have now further explain'd our≈øelves, and pur≈øued the de≈øign before opened, as far as appeared needful at pre≈øent. To ≈øave the trouble of repetition, we have ≈øeveral times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered the reader to things ≈øaid in the examination.</p>
            <p>Our aim has been to attend to the principal point in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, not to dwell on le≈ø≈øer and circum≈øtantial things.

the examiner. The main objection to Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme is, that he argues for a nece≈ø≈øity which can be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended on this only hypothe≈øis, that God is the cau≈øe of ≈øin. To this ≈øingle que≈øtion, the whole controver≈øy is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducible. Whoever would defend his book mu≈øt either ≈øhew, that the leading principles of it do not ≈øuppo≈øe the deity to be the <hi>efficient</hi> of moral evil; or el≈øe that ≈øuch a ≈øuppo≈øition is no reproach to his character and government. We dare affirm he is not the efficient cau≈øe of moral evil; yea, ≈øhould we pre≈øume to affirm that he is this cau≈øe, it would, we doubt not in the lea≈øt, be ≈øtriking at the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all religion.</p>
            <p>The pulic attention and candor would now have been a≈øked no longer, had it not been the opinion of a number of re≈øpectable gentlemen, that we are called upon to take ≈øome notice of the "e≈ø≈øay on moral agency" &amp;c. through which are inter≈øper≈øed remarks on what we wrote before, and in ≈øome parts of which the author has conde≈øcended more profe≈ø≈øedly to attend to the examination.

            </head>
            <p>THIS e≈ø≈øay contains ≈øcarce any thing new. But few arguments are advanced in it, except ≈øuch as Mr. Edwards had made u≈øe of, and handled with more appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of rea≈øon. In examining Mr. Edwards, we have ≈øuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently replied to the mo≈øt material things in Mr. We≈øt. Mr. We≈øt, in denying original righteou≈øne≈øs, departs, indeed, from Mr. Edwards. <note n="*" place="bottom">Compare part I. ≈øect. 1, 2. of Mr. We≈øt's e≈ø≈øay (particularly p. 53.) with Edwards p. 43.</note> There is al≈øo a <hi>verbal</hi> difference between the≈øe two gentlemen re≈øpecting the agency of the Deity in ≈øin. While Mr. Edwards denies (in words) a po≈øitive di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine influence or efficiency in moral evil, Mr. We≈øt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pre≈øsly maintains it, and argues (in his manner) for it, through a number of ≈øections, in the ≈øecond part of his e≈ø≈øay. This, however, is no more than Mr. Edwards's doctrine amounts to, as hath been ≈øhewn. We purpo≈øe to re≈øume this point after taking notice of ≈øome other things in the e≈ø≈øay before us, and ≈øome exceptions to our former publication.</p>
            <p>In the ≈øection on <hi>power,</hi> we conjecture that Mr. We≈øt hath applied this word improperly, as a philo≈øopher and as a morali≈øt. The word, as u≈øed in mechanics, is never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied, by any philo≈øopher we have had opportunity to read, in the manner Mr. We≈øt applies it, to the body <hi>moved;</hi> but

uniformly and con≈øtantly to the <hi>mover.</hi>

            <p>Admitting his application of the word power to me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanics had been philo≈øophical, what is the inference? that moral agency and mechani≈øm are the ≈øame? So it ≈øeems. But this, we ≈øuppo≈øe, Mr. We≈øt would not be fond of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining; becau≈øe he appears to di≈øapprove Lord Kaim's o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion recited p. 128.‚ÄîAnd becau≈øe he [Mr. We≈øt] hath attempted to ≈øhew, that his own ≈øcheme does not make mankind machines. Part I. ≈øect. 7. Moreover, in this ≈øame ≈øection on power, he informs us, that he is "far from apprehending" that his beforementioned u≈øe <q>of the word power is the <hi>only</hi> ≈øen≈øe in which it may be u≈øed with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety, as applied to <hi>moral agents</hi>‚Äîto <hi>men.</hi> It may doubtle≈øs be u≈øed with propriety to indicate‚Äî≈øomething wherein man is a moral agent, and on account of which he is a fit ≈øubject of prai≈øe or blame, commendation or cen≈øure.</q> P. 42. The word power, then, as above ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to human nature, <q>points out no abilities properly in men‚Äînothing wherein they are moral agents.</q>
            </p>
            <p>P. 44. He <q>attempts to illu≈øtrate that idea of power, which indicateth and denoteth ≈øome ability properly in men‚Äî≈øomething wherein man is <hi>a moral agent,</hi> and in which there is de≈øert of prai≈øe or blame,</q> &amp;c. What is this power or ability, which is e≈ø≈øential to moral agency? We are told it is "voluntary exertion." Whatever <q>
                  <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal action</hi>‚Äîtakes place upon our willing it, is in our power.</q> (P.46.) Whatever <q>event or action doth not fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low the election of the mind, is not in our power.</q>‚Äî Yet in the next paragraph, Mr. We≈øt ≈øaith, Power, in this "con≈øtruction of it, is not e≈ø≈øential to moral agency."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="144" facs="unknown:012746_0141_0F8BED705E6BA4B8"/>The≈øe things require no very <hi>critical</hi> animadver≈øions. When the word power is applied to human nature in Mr. We≈øt's fir≈øt ≈øen≈øe, <hi>it points out nothing wherein men are moral agents.</hi> When it is u≈øed in his ≈øecond ≈øen≈øe, <hi>it is not e≈ø≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to moral agency.</hi> The con≈øequence is plain, that men are not moral agents, having no power or ability that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicateth moral agency. We are clear with Mr. We≈øt, that power, in either of the ≈øen≈øes he u≈øeth it, doth not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>note moral agency. <q>The mind may be free, and exert it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf with great ≈øtrength, without any of</q> the la≈øt-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned "power." And in the fir≈øt-mentioned ≈øen≈øe, <q>it in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicateth nothing wherein man is a moral agent.</q> A power or liberty with reference to <hi>external actions only</hi> is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to human nature by ≈øome gentlemen, who yet grant, that virtue and vice lie in the frame of the heart. Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ≈øay they, is e≈ø≈øential to moral agency. What liberty? <hi>External?</hi> no; for an intelligent creature may be holy or ≈øinful without ≈øuch liberty. <hi>Internal?</hi> no; for in re≈øpect to inward vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litions &amp; di≈øpo≈øitions, they have <q>not a power to operate, but only a power to be wrought upon.</q> (P.43.) We appeal to common ≈øen≈øe whether ≈øuch a ≈øcheme leaves any room to a≈øcribe liberty or agency to mankind? Whether it doth not wholly confound moral agency with mechani≈øm? For who ever attributed liberty or agency to the meer ≈øubject and in≈øtrument of a foreign operation and action? As well might the ≈øaw, ax, or ≈øtaff in the hands of any man be called agents. Is this the re≈øult of a <q>
                  <hi>careful and ≈øtrict</hi> examination and explanation of the powers of human nature?</q> Is it a <hi>little</hi> peculiar, that in an e≈ø≈øay profe≈ø≈øed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wrote on "moral agency," the ≈øubject <hi>it≈øelf</hi> has been kept wholy out of ≈øight?</p>
            <p>The two fir≈øt ≈øections we have now publi≈øhed ≈øeem to ≈øuper≈øede the occa≈øion for a particular reply to Mr. We≈øt's on moral agency and power. We refer him there for fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ≈øatisfaction. We only remark, that as there appears to us no difference between ≈øuppo≈øing God to be the cau≈øe of ≈øin by his action on the creature <hi>after made,</hi> and ≈øuppo≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an intelligent being to be <hi>made</hi> ≈øinful by him <hi>at fir≈øt;</hi> ≈øo, if we under≈øtand Mr. We≈øt, he means to make no dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:012746_0142_0F8BED70F88D3028"/>
but a≈ø≈øerts both. Mr. Edwards rather cho≈øe to expre≈øs him≈øelf in ≈øuch manner as leads the reader to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude his opinion was, that God is the <hi>mediate</hi> cau≈øe of ≈øin; Mr. We≈øt maintains that he is the <hi>immediate</hi> cau≈øe of it. Indeed he ob≈øerves, "the whole and only difference" be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween <q>an immediate and mediate dependance is, that, <hi>in the one ca≈øe,</hi> the cau≈øe‚Äîoperates through one or a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of <hi>means‚Äîin the other,</hi> its tendency and influence are <hi>immediately</hi> ≈øeen, and it doth not operate through any <hi>medium.</hi> It is quite <hi>unphilo≈øophical</hi> (not to ≈øay <hi>athei≈øtical</hi>) to ≈øuffer any number of intervening <hi>media</hi> to ob≈øcure the agency of that divine hand, which God is lifting up, and making vi≈øible in all his works.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">P. 96.</note> We hence conclude, that Mr. We≈øt will not except to our rea≈øoning, ≈øection ≈øecond, that it makes no material difference whether the Deity is ≈øuppo≈øed to be the <hi>mediate</hi> or <hi>immediate</hi> cau≈øe of ≈øin and moral turpitude. And when he ≈øhall ≈øhew, that God is the cau≈øe of every act of will in the creatures, ≈øhould the examiner be in≈øtrumental to continue the di≈øpute, he would contradict his own opinion, expre≈ø≈øed p. 6. of the examination.</p>
            <p>P. 140. Mr. We≈øt concedes, <q>that what Mr. Edwards hath ≈øaid on the ≈øubject of <hi>motives</hi> is liable to <hi>≈øome</hi> of the exceptions which the examiner hath taken again≈øt it.</q>
Yet he is "<hi>humbly</hi> of opinion if" what he hath offered in his own e≈ø≈øay <q>were properly con≈øidered, we ≈øhould not find the appearance of ≈øuch incon≈øi≈øtency and ab≈øurdity ‚Äîas the examiner would per≈øuade the public‚Äîmay be fa≈øtened upon Mr. Edwards.</q> 
               <note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">P. 72.</note> The examiner, with many others, would have been glad to have ≈øeen this <q>
                  <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance</hi> of incon≈øi≈øtency</q> removed. Notwith≈øtanding the "carefulne≈øs" Mr. W. has taken in <q>examining and explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the nature and influence of motives,</q>

≈øaith he, it is u≈øed, neither for volition, nor the cau≈øe of volition; but merely for the external object which doth, or ought to, engage the affection, and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minate the choice.‚ÄîThus, <hi>the motives of the go≈øpel</hi> mean <hi>the rea≈øons exhibited in the go≈øpel,</hi> why men ought to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øake their ≈øins, and turn unto God. Multitudes have the≈øe rea≈øons (motives) full in view; and yet utterly refu≈øe and neglect to return.</q> As ≈øuppo≈øe motives of intere≈øt, honor, profit, extant in the mind's view at the ≈øame time with the motives of the go≈øpel; the former govern to the neglect and refu≈øal of the latter. The <hi>inferior</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived motive determines the mind's choice to the rejection of the <hi>≈øuperior.</hi> For are motives "exhibited and full in view," and yet not <hi>apparent</hi> to or <hi>perceived</hi> by the mind to which they are exhibited, and in who≈øe view they ≈øtand? If they <hi>are</hi> perceived, then how can it be that the highe≈øt motive always determines volition? Are not tho≈øe motives, which <hi>ought</hi> to govern, highe≈øt, if <hi>full in the view?</hi> Yet <q>mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titudes utterly neglect and refu≈øe them.</q> On the other hand, if they are <hi>not</hi> apparent or perceived, then how are they <hi>exhibited</hi> to, and <hi>full in view</hi> of the mind? how <hi>refu≈øed</hi> or <hi>neglected?</hi> Mr. We≈øt in≈øi≈øts, that motives influence the mind only as the mind is in actual motion in the percep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of them. But if perception and choice be the ≈øame, how then do motives <hi>influence</hi> volition? how have they a <hi>tendency</hi> to it? Do they influence, have they a tendency, to that which is actually <hi>effected?</hi> After volition has <hi>taken place,</hi> 'tis too late for their influence and tendency. But perhaps what follows may clear up this difficulty: Though <q>no tendency of motives to volition is perceived and felt, otherwi≈øe than in the <hi>actual taking place and exertion of choice;</hi> yet there is a foundation in the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things, ari≈øing from ≈øome certain quality in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, and from the particular ≈øtate, temper and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexion of the mind, for their being cho≈øen as ≈øoon as they ≈øhall come into the view of the mind.</q> (The rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der will remember he had ju≈øt been ≈øpeaking of motives <hi>full in view, but utterly refu≈øed.</hi>) Apply this to the evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical motives to repentance. With re≈øpect to tho≈øe who≈øe "≈øtate, temper and complexion of mind," antecedently
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:012746_0144_0F8BED7282631968"/>
corre≈øpond to the≈øe motives, they have a tendency to lead to repentance: But with re≈øpect to tho≈øe in whom there is not this antecedent corre≈øpondence of temper, they have not this tendency in the lea≈øt. There is no founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for a tendency in go≈øpel motives to engage men's choice, unle≈øs the ≈øtate and temper of their minds corre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pond to the≈øe motives, antecedent to the exhibition of them. Now will Mr. We≈øt ≈øay, that there is this corre≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pondence of temper in any <hi>unregenerate</hi> per≈øon? We tru≈øt he will not. The con≈øequence will then be, that <hi>that</hi> change, which the go≈øpel hath a tendency and is de≈øigned to produce in men, mu≈øt be actually effected before it's motives are exhibited‚Äîthe end mu≈øt be accompli≈øhed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the means are applied‚Äî≈øinners mu≈øt for≈øake their ≈øins and turn to God, and then the go≈øpel motives will have a tendency to lead them to repentance; but not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The go≈øpel then is no tender to the unregenerate. And if not to them, who are tho≈øe "multitudes" to whom its motives are exhibited, and who "utterly refu≈øe and neglect" them, though "full in their view?"</p>
            <p>Such a notion of tendency and influence in motives is very ≈øingular. When did any writer before Mr. We≈øt ever u≈øe the term motives in this ≈øen≈øe? that the thing motives are de≈øigned to engage to mu≈øt be effected before the exibition and perception of them? that motives obtain this appellation from the mind's being in actual motion? that motives full in view are utterly neglected and refu≈øed? We are quite content the public ≈øhould judge, whether Mr. We≈øt's attempt to reconcile Mr. Edwards with him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf has removed the appearance of incon≈øi≈øtency and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øurdity, or hath not rather confu≈øed and jumbled ≈øtill more the ≈øubject of the determination of the will by mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives. In what ≈øen≈øe the influence of motives in moral vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litions may be admitted, we have endeavoured to ≈øhew Part III. ≈øect. 2. of the examination, and ≈øection 2d. of the pre≈øent continuation thereof.</p>
            <p>P. 24; 76,‚Äî79. Quotations are made in abundance from the examiner to prove him gro≈øsly incon≈øi≈øtent with him≈øelf, and that he hath given in ample te≈øtimony to the truth of the doctrine he oppo≈øeth. Had Mr. We≈øt <q>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:012746_0145_0F8BED733AA4E0E0"/>
con≈øidered</q> that at p. 92. he quotes the examiner as admitting, that every moral event mu≈øt have a cau≈øe, and ≈øaying, that moral agents are the cau≈øes of their own actions, he would not, perhaps, have given him≈øelf the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to copy ≈øo much from the examination. We do main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that the ≈øubjects of moral volitions are al≈øo the cau≈øe of their own volitions. This is a different thing from ≈øay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that volition is its own cau≈øe. The di≈øtinction between the terms volition and agent is plain. Agents determine them≈øelves; we ≈øay not that the properties or actions of agents are ≈øelf-determined‚Äîthat volition, which is already become effect, is the cau≈øe of it's own exi≈øtence. Mr. We≈øt had no occa≈øion to repre≈øent the examiner's doctrine in this light. And though he ≈øuppo≈øeth that an enquiry in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the cau≈øe of volition belongs not to the ≈øubject of moral agency, yet we pre≈øume enough hath been ≈øaid, particularly in the 5th ≈øection, to ≈øhew that it doth. In the ≈øame part of Mr. We≈øt's e≈ø≈øay, the examiner is cen≈øured pretty ≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verely for not allowing more weight to a particular di≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction of Mr. Edwards's, and treating it with contempt. "Upon a review of the matter," Mr. We≈øt <q>thinks the examiner him≈øelf will be convinced that he hath not herein done ju≈øtice to Mr. Edwards.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The examiner hath "reviewed the matter," and is "convinced" of no other "inju≈øtice herein done" by him "to Mr. Edwards," than that he did not ≈øufficiently ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>po≈øe the weakne≈øs of the di≈øtinction refered to. While he a≈øks pardon for this omi≈ø≈øion, he hopes he has made ≈øome atonement for it by taking the trouble to write an whole ≈øection profe≈ø≈øedly on the point. Herein he hath al≈øo an≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wered to another exception of Mr. We≈øt's a few lines below on the ≈øame page; (p. 83.) and in his turn mu≈øt fault Mr. We≈øt for an unfair repre≈øentation of him. The reader by turning to the page in the examination, which Mr. We≈øt refers to, will ≈øee the repre≈øentation is partial.</p>
            <p>In what Mr. We≈øt hath offered, in divers parts of his e≈ø≈øay, in a critical way, on the antecedent ≈øtate of the mind and volition, he appears ≈ølow in under≈øtanding the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, and doth not repre≈øent him to ≈øuch advantage as might have been done con≈øi≈øtently enough with ≈øound critici≈øm.</p>

We ob≈øerve Mr. We≈øt don't deny but the ≈øpecimen of coincidence we have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited in it is ju≈øt. But admitting the agreement, he thinks it of no weight to ≈øhew that Mr. Edwards's doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine is wrong; and intimates, that the examiner ≈øhould have an≈øwered and confuted the arguments both of Mr. Edwards and tho≈øe [<hi>fatali≈øts, epicurians and athei≈øts</hi>] with whom he coincided‚ÄîAn encomium is al≈øo pa≈øs'd on their "learning"‚Äîbut (prudently enough) not on their <hi>religious</hi> character. 'Tis ≈øufficient to ob≈øerve, That the doctrine of the writers with whom Mr. Edwards's ≈øentiments were compared has, by the general con≈øent of Chri≈øtians, been ≈øuppo≈øed fal≈øe; and moreover, repeatedly confuted by the advocates for revealed and natural religion. We did not think it worth while, in our former publication, to enter on the enquiry, Whether the principles of tho≈øe fatali≈øts, epicureans and athei≈øts were the truth; but ventured to take the oppo≈øite "principles <hi>upon tru≈øt.</hi>" Mr. We≈øt may find by looking into the preface, page 4, and part II. at the beginning, that we propo≈øed to con≈øider the ≈øubject in a <hi>practical,</hi> rather than in a <hi>≈øpeculative, metaphy≈øical</hi> way‚Äî that a number of principles were taken for granted. If he really di≈øputes any of tho≈øe preliminary principles, or ≈øhould directly appear as an advocate for fatality and athei≈øm, and there ≈øhould be danger of athei≈øm's gaining ground <hi>in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence of what he may publi≈øh;</hi> no doubt there are tho≈øe who will debate the ≈øubject of nece≈ø≈øity with him, as it ≈øtands on the footing of fatality or athei≈øm‚Äîor at lea≈øt encourage a re-publication of ≈øome of the irrefragable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwers of tho≈øe authors who have appeared in this contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øy with avowed fatali≈øts and athei≈øts. At pre≈øent we are not willing to think there is occa≈øion to enter on a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futation of athei≈øtical principles. We ≈øhould be ≈øorry, if, in a <hi>Chri≈øtian</hi> land, <hi>natural religion</hi> at lea≈øt may not be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øuppo≈øed. We ≈øuppo≈øed we had <q>to do with tho≈øe who believe the bible,</q> as Mr. Edwards ≈øaid he had. (P. 138.) If Mr. We≈øt ≈øhould write another e≈ø≈øay on moral agency, we hope we ≈øhould have no occa≈øion to alter our opinion.</p>
            <p>Mr. We≈øt, it ≈øeems, was ≈øen≈øible, that the principles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:012746_0148_0F8BED7579F8FCF8"/>
from tho≈øe writers, with whom we have compared. Mr. Edwards, were indeed "obnoxious and unpopular," no le≈øs than the doctrine he him≈øelf hath, advanced, or he would not have intimated his concern, that the ≈øpecimen of coincidence exhibited in our appendix might prejudice the reader again≈øt Mr. Edwards, <q>rai≈øe a popular cry a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain≈øt him, and ca≈øt an odium on his ≈øentiments.</q> Mr. We≈øt remarks, what the examiner him≈øelf had ≈øaid, that he did not ≈øuppo≈øe the agreement of Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme with their opinion who di≈ø≈øented from the common belief, even in the heathen world, proves it to be fal≈øe. We were, indeed, far from ≈øuppo≈øing that this <hi>alone</hi> proved it fal≈øe. At the ≈øame time we knew, that the doctrine of the old fatali≈øts was as generally rejected among Chri≈øtians, as the principles of <hi>Bellarmine</hi> among prote≈øtants‚Äîand ≈øuppo≈øed on as good rea≈øons. It was, therefore, thought it might be taken for granted, that Mr. Edwards's foundation principle being ≈øhewn to coincide with the fatality of the heathen, would be ≈øufficient with all Chri≈øtians for it's being reject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: Nor have we any ≈øcruple, but Mr. We≈øt's attempt to vindicate it will ≈øerve the good purpo≈øe of bringing it into ju≈øt abhorrence.</p>
            <p>We are, upon the whole, by no means compelled to grant, that we have mi≈ørepre≈øented Mr. Edwards in any of the things laid to our charge. If we had indeed mi≈øtook his meaning, the difficulty of apprehending him; his u≈øing words (as he declares) out of their common acceptation; bewildering him≈øelf and his readers with a multiplicity of refinements and ≈øubtile di≈øtinctions, and the probability that in many places he had no determinate ideas, would be ≈øome apology. It hath not, however, been in any mea≈øure ≈øhewn, that we have been guilty of mi≈ørepre≈øentation.</p>
            <p>N. B. On Mr. We≈øt's admonition, (p. 152.) we have reviewed part IV. ≈øect. 6. of Mr. Edwards's enquiry, and find it no an≈øwer to the objection; but are rather confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the opinion, that he cho≈øe to "evade a direct an≈øwer."</p>
            <p>The other part of the accu≈øation again≈øt the examiner is, that he hath injured the <hi>truth.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. We≈øt ju≈øtly remarks, that <q>Mr. Edwards's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is but of ≈ømall importance compared to that of

the cau≈øe of truth.</q> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Preface, p. 8.</note> As the examiner hopes it doth not appear that he hath done any inju≈øtice to the former, ≈øo he pre≈øumes he is clear in regard to the latter‚ÄîThough he pretends not that he is wholly free from error, yet Mr. We≈øt has not convinced him of publi≈øhing any thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious to truth. The main thing in which it is alledged that he hath injured the truth is, his a≈ø≈øerting a power of ≈øelf-determination in moral agents. In what ≈øen≈øe the examiner a≈ø≈øerts ≈øuch a power, with the evidence in ≈øup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of it, the reader may ≈øee, if he will take the trouble to look over Part III. ≈øect. 1. of the examination, and ≈øect. I. and II. of the pre≈øent continuation of it.</p>
            <p>Mr. We≈øt repre≈øents it as the examiner's <q>real ≈øenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,‚Äîthat <hi>unregenerate</hi> ≈øinners have as full power, to all intents and purpo≈øes, to do every thing that is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally required of them‚Äîas the regenerate have; or even the angels of God in heaven.</q> 
               <note n="‚Ä†" place="bottom">P. 162.</note> In proof of this, he hath made two quotations from p. 116, of the examinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, leaving out ≈øome intermediate words, which, had he quoted, the reader would have ≈øeen, that the above-men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned is as far from being the author's <hi>real ≈øentiment</hi> as the mo≈øt obnoxious in Mr. We≈øt's e≈ø≈øay. The fir≈øt quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation is in the following words: <q>We deny that any are commanded, invited, exhorted, &amp;c. to exert powers and faculties they are not po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of; to act from princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples they are not endowed with.</q> Here the quotation ≈øtops. Ju≈øtice to him≈øelf obligeth the examiner to <hi>re-pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh</hi> what intervenes this and the other quotation‚Äî<q>to u≈øe means out of their power. Such faculties, principles, powers and affections as they are po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of, ≈øuch means as are within their power, are the only ones they can be required to act from and improve: Arguments laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore wicked men are adapted to operate on their rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øon and moral di≈øcernment; on the principle of inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuity and gratitude; on their hope, fear, joy, ≈øorrow, and the various movements of the mind.</q> Had Mr. We≈øt produced the≈øe intermediate words, his readers would have ≈øeen, that the terms "powers and faculties" in his quotation mean "rea≈øon and moral di≈øcernment"‚Äîthat
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:012746_0150_0F8BED78864F0D20"/>
by the word "principles" the examiner meant ≈øuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as the≈øe <q>ingenuity, gratitude, hope, fear, joy, ≈øor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</q> &amp;c. Now are not the unregenerate "po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed" of the powers and faculties ≈øpoken of? Are not "rea≈øon and moral di≈øcernment" e≈ø≈øential to moral agency? Are tho≈øe who are not po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of ≈øuch powers and faculties <q>commanded, invited, exhorted to exert</q> them? And are not the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regenerate "endowed with" the natural principles of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections "of ingenuity, gratitude, hope, fear," &amp;c? Or are tho≈øe who are not endowed with ≈øuch principles and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectinos "commanded, invited, exhorted, &amp;c. to act from" them?

The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øwer to the≈øe que≈øtions will ≈øhew whether the examiner hath injured the truth, or been injured by his <hi>remarker.</hi> Nothing could be farther from the examiner's <hi>real ≈øenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> or intention than to a≈ø≈øert, that man's <hi>moral</hi> power in unregeneracy is equal to all his nece≈ø≈øities, or to his whole duty. Nothing would be more contrary to, than what Mr. We≈øt repre≈øents to be <hi>in fact and reality,</hi> his o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion, viz. that the unregenerate are not commanded, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited, exhorted to exert or act from any other <hi>moral</hi> prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples, affections and di≈øpo≈øitions than they are endowed with. He would further fa≈øten this ≈øentiment on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aminer by his other quotation refered to above, and which immediately follows the intervening ≈øentences already quot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. This other quotation is a di≈ømember'd part of a ≈øen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in the words following. <q>Nor can it be propo≈øed that the unregenerate ≈øhould act from the highe≈øt ≈øpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual principles</q>‚Äîhere Mr. We≈øt's quotation ≈øtops, which ≈øhould have been continued, (in≈øtead of a period, with a comma only, after the word <hi>principles)</hi> thus: <q>but from ≈øuch as they are capable of being influenced by as rea≈øonable beings, po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of a moral faculty, and ≈øubjects of moral government,</q> &amp;c. In ≈øome preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pages, the examiner had been ≈øpeaking of the means of grace u≈øed with unregenerate men <hi>in order to</hi> their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver≈øion.

               <q>it cannot be propo≈øed that the unregenerate ≈øhould act from the highe≈øt ≈øpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual principles.</q> For by the very ≈øuppo≈øition, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervention of the propo≈øed medium is ≈øuper≈øeded. The examiner cannot ≈øee wherein the argument fails, or is inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to truth. The whole paragraph, together with the connection it ≈øtands in, clearly ≈øhews the examiner's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign and meaning to have been as now explained. That it is the duty of the unregenerate to for≈øake their ≈øins‚Äîthat they have no excu≈øe for making any delay in turning to God‚Äîthat they are obliged to love him with all their heart‚Äîand con≈øequently to act from <hi>moral</hi> and <hi>≈øpiritual</hi> principles they are not po≈ø≈øe≈ø≈øed of, or endowed with, the examiner fully believes, nor hath he ever denied. If it <q>was not with de≈øign, but wholly for want of under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtanding what the opinion and real ≈øentiment</q> of the examiner is, that Mr. We≈øt hath ≈øo gro≈øsly "mi≈ørepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented" him, he can ea≈øily forgive this wrong: But it is not ≈øo ea≈øy to ≈øee how Mr. We≈øt can forgive him≈øelf, if he hath thus "perverted" the examiner's <q>meaning, and wre≈øted his words from their plain and obvious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, de≈øignedly, by forced and unnatural con≈øtruction‚Äîhaving no other end in view than to rai≈øe the popular cry again≈øt him, and ca≈øt an odium upon his ≈øentiments and character.<note n="*" place="bottom">Preface p. 9.

               </q>‚ÄîThe examiner doth not charge Mr. We≈øt with the la≈øt mentioned view and de≈øign. He hopes better things.

Though as this point doth not directly fall within his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øign, he hath not enlarged upon it.

We fear the public will think that more than attention enough hath been already given to metaphy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øical ≈øubtilties. If the reader's patience hath held out thus far, we are very thankful, and are loth to tre≈øpa≈øs on it any further.</p>
            <p>Mr. We≈øt hath pretermitted many material difficulties the examiner had noticed in Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme. <hi>The whole fir≈øt part</hi> of the examination is unnoticed, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicitly confirmed, by him. Nor is the lea≈øt notice taken of ≈øection 3d. part III. where the examiner attempts to
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:012746_0155_0F8BED7C39CE5700"/>
≈øhew, that if Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme be true in ≈øpeculation, it is not applicable to <hi>practice.</hi> But very few things in the other parts of the examination are remarked upon, and mo≈øt of tho≈øe that are, much mi≈ørepre≈øented. If it would not be too touch <hi>vanity,</hi> the examiner would con≈øtrue Mr. We≈øt's pretermi≈ø≈øion of ≈øome things as a tacit approbation of them. But he calls to mind, that <q>a vindication of Mr. Edwards was not ≈øo particularly in</q> Mr. We≈øt's "view." And wherein he has mi≈øunder≈øtood or mi≈ørepre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øented the examiner, the latter might be ≈øo unhappy as not to expre≈øs his ≈øentiments with preci≈øion and per≈øpicuity. It was far from any ≈ølight of the examiner's performance, that Mr. We≈øt omitted to remark on the greater and <hi>princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal</hi> part of it. He hath admitted the examiner's chief ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to Mr. Edwards's book, which is more generous than was even expected.</p>
            <p>The objection refered to is, that Mr. Edwards's doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine makes God the cau≈øe of ≈øin. This Mr. We≈øt admits, and ≈øets him≈øelf to prove that there is no weight in it. The examiner was fully per≈øuaded that this was the clear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øequence of Mr. Edwards's doctrine, and imagined that whenever it was made to appear, the advocates for the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine among <hi>Chri≈øtians</hi> would immediately renounce it. He little expected that the con≈øequence would be adopted as a principle, and an attempt made to defend it, by any one of Mr. Edwards's friends. He hath the ≈øatisfaction to find, that many worthy gentlemen, who have thought favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably of Mr. Edwards's book, expre≈øs much di≈øapprobati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of Mr. We≈øt's performance. Nor is the examiner without hopes, that what Mr. We≈øt hath wrote may an≈øwer the good end of bringing into ju≈øt di≈øcredit the doctrine for which he hath appeared as an advocate.</p>
            <p>Moral and Chri≈øtian writers hitherto have cho≈øen to ≈øay, that God <hi>permits</hi> or <hi>≈øuffers</hi> moral evil. But, ≈øays Mr. We≈øt, <q>in my humble opinion, the≈øe terms have been improperly u≈øed. We have no occa≈øion for the≈øe ≈øoften<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, lenient, gentle, timid, in≈øignificant terms, in order to relieve our imaginations‚Äîit implying no incon≈øi≈øten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy to ≈øuppo≈øe, that God, either mediately or immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by his CREATIVE will and <hi>agency cau≈øeth</hi> the exi≈øt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence

So exceeding peremptory is he in this opinion, that to put any other con≈øtruction on the≈øe expre≈ø≈øions, is to <q>≈øub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilize and perfectly interpret them away</q>‚Äî<q>God hath the ≈øame right to MAKE ≈øome of mankind holy, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers <hi>≈øinful,</hi> as the potter hath power over the clay to form one ve≈ø≈øel unto honour, and another unto di≈øho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor.</q> In any other way of "analy≈øing the word of God," he thinks, <q>we mu≈øt forever de≈øpair of determining any doctrine by it</q>‚Äîand tells us, that <q>the apo≈øtle Paul is full in this doctrine of DIVINE EFFICIENCY in moral evil</q>‚Äîwhich, <q>however di≈øgu≈øtful and unpopular in our day, we hope,</q> ≈øays he, <q>the time will come when the ≈øcriptures ≈øhall be under≈øtood in their true ≈øimplici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, beauty and per≈øpicuity; and the ≈øpirit of God be ≈øo plentifully poured out, that the pa≈ø≈øions and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of men ≈øhall not be irritated by <hi>plain evangeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal truth.</hi>

            <p>Here the reader hath a general view of Mr. We≈øt's ≈øcheme, and ≈øome ≈øpecimen of the ≈øpirit with which he wrote. Similar in≈øtances of po≈øitivene≈øs, a≈ø≈øurance and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charitablen≈øs are inter≈øper≈øed through the whole of his e≈ø≈øay, and may be ≈øeen, by tho≈øe who de≈øire it, in the three fir≈øt pages of his preface‚Äîal≈øo p. 31; 75; 88; 128; 140: 172; 217, 218; 253, and ≈øundry other places.

This is to be <q>challenged in a high tone;</q> (p. 127.) and ill comports with ≈øome profe≈ø≈øi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of mode≈øty and di≈ø≈øidence in the preface to his perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance‚Äîwith his frequently be≈øpeaking the public candor to a "new and obnoxious doctrine advanced" by him‚Äîwith the a≈ø≈øurances (as an encouragement to follow him in "an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beaten path") that he would not be "po≈øitive"‚Äîthat his "fears and apprehen≈øions had been great lea≈øt he ≈øhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach" his maker‚Äîwith his further reque≈øting the public to be even lavi≈øh of their candor, and not con≈øtrue <q>any air of peremptorine≈øs as intended to expre≈øs the confidence he had in his own ≈øentiments, but as meant to give the argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment its greate≈øt advantage.</q>
            </p>
            <p>They who de≈øire candor mu≈øt be candid. <q>Perempto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine≈øs</q> rather manife≈øts a writer's "confidence" than helps his "argument." It ≈øeldom fails to excite di≈øgu≈øt. It is e≈øpecially offen≈øive in "a young writer"‚ÄîMo≈øt of all when writing again≈øt "the reigning ≈øentiments"‚Äîwriting on a ≈øubject too, which "hath engaged the attention, and employed the pens, of the greate≈øt geniu≈øes, in all ages," while yet none of them (among the friends of religion) ever had the a≈ø≈øurance to advance and defend this princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that all the wickedne≈øs in the world proceeds from <hi>the creating will and efficiency of God.</hi> Well might Mr. We≈øt call his doctrine "new, di≈øgu≈øtful and unpopular." And was no more re≈øpect due to the public, who≈øe candor was a≈øked! No more to the republic of letters in particular! No more to wi≈øe and good men of all denominations! Could he expect, that his ≈øpeaking of him≈øelf as "an inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced writer" would atone for the a≈øper≈øion ca≈øt on all who do not embrace this new and ≈øtrange doctrine, as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to the ≈øovereignty and grace of God?‚Äîde≈øtitute of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion and con≈øcience?

               <pb n="161" facs="unknown:012746_0158_0F8BED7E85EBD6B0"/>The point in which all Mr. We≈øt's arguments meet‚Äîwhich he takes for granted through the fir≈øt part of his e≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øay, and ≈øets him≈øelf to defend in the ≈øecond, is, the divine agency and efficiency in ≈øin. Mr. Edwards would not ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit this was a con≈øequence from his doctrine. And many may be ready to think, that, in repre≈øenting Mr. Edwards in this light, Mr. We≈øt hath done greater inju≈øtice to that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>„Äà‚óä„Äâ</desc>
               </gap> divine, than any he chargeth the examiner with. In truth, when Mr. We≈øt ≈øaw that Mr. Edwards's ≈øcheme concluded in this, he ought at once to have renounced a doctrine ≈øo reproachful to his maker. LET GOD BE TRUE, AND EVERY MAN A LYAR. A direct denial of the God that is above would not be a greater grief and offence to mo≈øt intelligent and ≈øerious Chri≈øtians, than this doctrine of his <hi>cau≈øality</hi> in moral evil. They e≈øteem the a≈ø≈øertion bla≈øphemous. Mr. We≈øt, doubtle≈øs, views the matter in a very different light. But is it not a≈øtoni≈øhing that any di≈øcerning, ≈øerious per≈øon ≈øhould a≈ø≈øert peremptorily, and with great uncharitablene≈øs too towards tho≈øe who differ from him, what is a≈ø≈øerted, and often repeated, in his e≈ø≈øay! Had he been humble and mode≈øt, would he not have been more fearful lea≈øt he ≈øhould publi≈øh things incon≈øi≈øtent with divine moral rectitude? In the leading ≈øentiment of his e≈ø≈øay, we have no other controver≈øy with him than all the Chri≈øtians in the world have‚Äîno other than all ≈øober, con≈øi≈øtent thei≈øts have.</p>
            <p>The Chri≈øtian's bible in≈øtructs him, that the <hi>new man</hi> is God's creation: But he never learnt from it, that the <hi>old man,</hi> with his deeds, is ≈øo. It in≈øtructs him, that the ≈øon of God was manife≈øted to de≈øtroy the works of the <hi>devil;</hi> not that he came to de≈øtroy the works of GOD‚Äîor that the works of the devil are the product of divine agency. It in≈øtructs him, that Je≈øus the ≈øon of God came to ≈øave his people from their <hi>≈øins;</hi> not that his de≈øign was to ≈øave them from the effects of the <hi>divine influence</hi> and <hi>operation</hi> upon them. His bible in≈øtructs the Chri≈øtian, that it is God who worketh in us to will and to do that which is <hi>good;</hi> not that he worketh in us to will and to do that which is <hi>≈øinful</hi> and contrary to his holy nature and law. The latter is expre≈ø≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a≈øcribed to the ≈øpirit which is in the world, in contradi≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:012746_0159_0F8BED80D0099358"/>
from the ≈øpirit which is in good men. (The ≈øpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit that worketh in the children of di≈øobedience is not, however, the proper <hi>efficient</hi> of their wickedne≈øs, he only ≈øolliciteth them to it. For every man is then tempted, when he is drawn away of his own lu≈øt, and enticed.) The Chri≈øtian learns from his bible, that God <hi>cannot be tempted with evil,</hi> and that <hi>he tempteth no man;</hi> not that every act of ≈øin is to be re≈øolved into his <hi>productive influence.</hi>
            </p>
            <q>‚òûWE may ≈øuppo≈øe a reader of Mr. We≈øt's e≈ø≈øay, to addre≈øs him thus: I admit, ≈øir, your po≈øition of the divine agency or efficiency in ≈øin. You have clearly e≈øtabli≈øhed it. But I deny that <hi>that</hi> being, whom you make the only cau≈øe of moral evil, is holy, ju≈øt and good. I demand a proof of his moral per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, on your principles. My bible, indeed, tells me, that God is holy, and commands me to be holy for this rea≈øon. But I deny the principle laid down. It ≈øhould have been, I the Lord your God am unho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly; and then the injunction would have ≈øtood thus, Be ye al≈øo unholy. If I rea≈øon wrong, pray ≈øet me right‚Äîand as you have made me a pro≈øelyte to your hypothe≈øis, ≈øhew me, if po≈ø≈øible, that God is holy, notwith≈øtanding his ≈øuppo≈øed efficiency in ≈øin.</q>
            <p>The fatality of the heathen is really le≈øs abhorrent than Mr. We≈øt's opinion of the divine efficiency in moral evil. They "fancied that <hi>Jupiter,</hi> and all the gods, were oblig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ≈øubmit to fate, which was to be controuled by no power whatever. The <hi>Stoics</hi> ≈øuppo≈øed that the untracta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blene≈øs of matter was the cau≈øe of evil; that God would have made all things perfect, but an evil bias in matter, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pugnant to his benevolence," prevented, "whence aro≈øe all manner of evil." This has ≈øome appearance of re≈øpect to the divine moral character: But Mr. We≈øt's opinion robs the deity of this character, even in appearance, as well as in reality. When ≈øuch things are publi≈øhed as "plain, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant, evangelical truths," what ≈øhall we ≈øay? Doth the publi≈øher really de≈øire to have the foundations, even of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural religion, laid again? Were an avowed ATHEIST to
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:012746_0160_0F8BED81AAF07268"/>
a≈ø≈øert them, we ≈øhould tell him he belied the perceptions and operations of his own mind, as well as tho≈øe of all mankind.</p>
            <p>There appears the ≈øame "air of peremptorine≈øs" in what Mr. We≈øt hath wrote on divine foreknowledge. The two fir≈øt pages of his preface manife≈øt this. We only ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øerve, that he repre≈øents tho≈øe who profe≈øs to believe di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine pre≈øcience and human liberty, and ≈øtill ≈øuppo≈øe that an <hi>human</hi> intellect cannot reconcile them together, as main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining that they are <hi>irreconcileable</hi> and <hi>incon≈øi≈øtent</hi> with each other. Let an in≈øtance be produced in ≈øupport of this. We know not a ≈øingle writer who maintains that pre≈øcience and liberty are incon≈øi≈øtent, profe≈ø≈øing at the ≈øame time a full belief of both. There is a plain difference between a per≈øon's ≈øaying that <hi>he</hi> cannot reconcile them, yea, that no <hi>human</hi> under≈øtanding can; and ≈øaying, they are <hi>ab≈øolutely</hi> irreconcileable and incon≈øi≈øtent. If Mr. We≈øt doth not di≈øcern a difference, he may po≈ø≈øibly find that wi≈øer men do, if he will be at the trouble to turn to the ≈øection on foreknowledge‚Äîto which we al≈øo refer him, together with the 4th. 5th. 8th. and 9th. ≈øections, for the nece≈ø≈øary ob≈øer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations on the merits of his opinion concerning the divine agency in moral evil.</p>
            <p>P. 103, 104. he ≈øaith, that the examiner's ≈øcheme <hi>"con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øedly"</hi> involved this difficulty, that pre≈øcience cannot be reconciled with liberty‚Äî(di≈øtingui≈øhing this word by a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent type, as we have done.) If the examiner hath <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈ø≈øed</hi> this‚Äîor if it can, by plain implication, be ≈øhewn to be contained in any thing he hath publi≈øhed, he will im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately retract it, as contrary to his own principles and common ≈øen≈øe. Mr. We≈øt be≈øt knows whether he <q>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øignedly mi≈øunder≈øtood or perverted</q> the examiner's "meaning." But after having repre≈øented him to the public as <hi>confe≈ø≈øing</hi> what cannot be fixed upon him by <hi>im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication,</hi> Mr. We≈øt ≈øhould not have taken occa≈øion to tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph over him as chargeable with the mo≈øt palpable "im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriety," and incapable of being impre≈ø≈øed with a ≈øen≈øe of it. This is ≈øomewhat extraordinary. Mr. We≈øt will de≈øerve pity, if this intimation doth not make "a deeper impre≈ø≈øion on his mind," than what he hath wrote in the
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:012746_0161_0F8BED82396E7BF0"/>
pages la≈øt refered to hath made on the examiner‚Äîand an impre≈ø≈øion of a quite different kind. By turning to the place, the reader may at once judge, whether the exami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner's words contain the <hi>confe≈ø≈øion</hi> a≈øcribed to him.</p>
            <p>In reply to Mr. We≈øt's hypothe≈øis, part II. ≈øect, 1, 2; 4. re≈øpecting the de≈øirablene≈øs of moral evil, and its being a nece≈ø≈øary means of effecting the greate≈øt good, we refer him to the ≈øixth ≈øection we have now publi≈øhed. He will, perhaps, find it a difficult ta≈øk to prove, that an holy God creates vicious di≈øpo≈øitions in multitudes, that they may be fit objects of eternal puni≈øhment, as a means of mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fe≈øting his glorious name, in their perdition, to a few ve≈ø<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øels of mercy: In other words, that the wickedne≈øs and puni≈øhment of infernals is what ≈øecures the holine≈øs and happine≈øs of ≈øaints and angels; and that with this view God effects their wickedne≈øs, that he may inflict their puni≈øhment. What warrant hath Mr. We≈øt, or any man, to ≈øay, that<g ref="char:punc">‚ñ™</g> had not moral evil exi≈øted, the governor of the world could not have exhibited his hatred of ≈øin, his love of holine≈øs, his goodne≈øs and authority illu≈øtriou≈øly in <hi>other</hi> ways?

If this be his doctrine, few ≈øen≈øible, ≈øerious per≈øons will think there is occa≈øion to proceed any further. It was the <hi>foundation</hi> which was propo≈øed to be examined.

Let the intelligent judge whether Mr. We≈øt is a Calvini≈øt. The que≈øtion, however, is not, what is Calvini≈øm? but, what is truth? What ≈øaith the ≈øcripture? As to the doctrines of grace, <hi>prote≈øtant</hi> divines have generally accounted them ≈øuch as the≈øe‚ÄîThe atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the mediator; ju≈øtification by faith in it; the effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of repentance to procure pardon through the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in Chri≈øt Je≈øus; the promi≈øe of divine aids, of peace with God, and of eternal life, through the ≈øame mediator. If by the doctrines of grace Mr. We≈øt means any thing contrary to the≈øe, let him explain him≈øelf.</p>
            <p>We cannot conclude without renewed expre≈ø≈øions of our a≈øtoni≈øhment, that a gentleman who is <hi>≈øet for the defence of the go≈øpel,</hi> (and we pre≈øume really believes it) ≈øhould pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>li≈øh ≈øo glaring a perver≈øion of it, (as many things contain'd in the e≈ø≈øay evidently are) in≈øtead of manife≈øting the truth as it is in Je≈øus. It reminds us of St. Paul's addre≈øs to the Galatians, <hi>Who hath bewitched you!</hi> If this be not to <hi>preach another go≈øpel,</hi> 'tis difficult to ≈øay what is. <hi>We can do nothing again≈øt the truth, but for the truth:</hi> Which words, while expe≈ø≈øive of the duty of a go≈øpel mini≈øter, are a cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him to <hi>take heed to his doctrine,</hi> that he be not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øtrumental in <hi>corrupting</hi> mens <hi>minds from the ≈øimplicity that is in Chri≈øt</hi>‚ÄîTo take heed, <hi>le≈øt haply he be found</hi> TO FIGHT AGAINST GOD. 'Tis a cheap ≈øacrifice to give up any hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothe≈øis to the honor of THE TRUTH AS IT IS IN JESUS; But a dreadful thing to CORRUPT THE WORD OF GOD.</p>
            <p>Tho≈øe who are employed to <hi>≈øpread the ≈øavor of the</hi> RE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEEMER'S name, and to addre≈øs mankind <hi>in the fulne≈øs of the ble≈ø≈øing of the go≈øpel of Chri≈øt;</hi> who≈øe incumbent Duty it is to <hi>u≈øe great plainne≈øs of ≈øpeech;</hi> ≈øhould account a reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ≈økill in <hi>metaphy≈øical</hi> di≈øqui≈øitions unworthy their emulation.</p>
            <p>Mr. We≈øt's ≈øcheme, on bare propo≈øal, ≈øtrikes an intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligent and devout mind with horror. It carries its own refutation. It is a palpable reproach to God, and repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant

to every ju≈øt idea of religion. No ≈øuppo≈øeable con≈øe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences can be more ≈øhocking than the naked doctrine it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>≈øelf; on the footing of which there is no moral agency and accountablene≈øs, no moral governor, no righteous judgment. He ought to be with≈øtood to the face, as one who hath ≈øpoken wickedly for God‚Äî(though we tru≈øt from prejudice and mi≈øapprehen≈øion, not from wilful en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to the truth.) We mean not to accu≈øe him of any <hi>de≈øigned</hi> perver≈øion of the doctrines of revelation. We wi≈øh he may ≈øee his error, as we are per≈øuaded it is very great. Should he be convinced of it, we doubt not but he will be ingenuous enough to acknowledge it, in honor both to him≈øelf and the truth.</p>
            <p>When impious tenets are publickly advanced, a vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the divine character forbids us to be unconcern'd. If any things we have ≈øaid towards the clo≈øe of the≈øe ≈øtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ≈øhould have the appearance of <hi>≈øeverity, that</hi> ≈øeverity hath not the <hi>per≈øon,</hi> but the <hi>opinions</hi> of our author for its object‚Äîopinions to which too ≈øtrong a di≈ølike cannot be expre≈ø≈øed‚ÄîWe have, at the ≈øame time, aimed to keep in mind the apo≈øtolic advice, <hi>In meekne≈øs in≈øtructing tho≈øe that oppo≈øe them≈øelves.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We can heartily join in <q>committing the cau≈øe to him who judgeth righteous judgment.</q>
