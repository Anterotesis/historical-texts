            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>ADDITIONS To COMMON SENLE. AMERICAN INDEPENDANCY <hi>defended.</hi>
            </head>
            <p>WHEN the little pamphlet intitled COMMON SENSE firſt made its appearance in favor of that ſo often abjured idea of independance upon Great-Britain, I was informed that no leſs than three gentlemen of reſpectable abilities were engaged to anſwer it. As yet I have ſeen nothing which di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly pretends to diſpute a ſingle poſition of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor. The oblique eſſay in Humphreys's paper, and ſolemn Teſtimony of the Quakers, however intended, having offered nothing to the purpoſe, I ſhall take leave to examine this important queſtion, with all candor and attention, and ſubmit the reſult to my much intereſted country.</p>
            <p>Dependance of one man, or ſtate, upon another, is either abſolute, or limited by ſome certain terms of agreement. The dependance of theſe colonies which Great-Britain calls <hi>conſtitutional,</hi> as declared by act of parliament, is abſolute. If the contrary of this be the bugbear ſo many have been declaiming againſt, I could wiſh my countrymen would conſider the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of ſo ſtupid a profeſſion. If a limited de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance is intended, I would be much obliged to any one who will ſhew me the <hi>Britanno American Magna Charta</hi> wherein the terms of our limited dependance are preciſely ſtated. If no ſuch thing can be found, and <hi>abſolute</hi> dependance be accounted inadmiſſible the ſound we are ſquabbling about has certainly no determinate meaning. If any ſay we mean that kind of dependance we acknowledge <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and before the
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:043053_0004_101CB158634649E8"/>
year 1763; I anſwer, <hi>vague and uncertain laws, and more eſpecially</hi> CONSTITUTIONS, are the very inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of ſlavery. The Magna Charta of England was very explicit, conſidering the time it was form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and yet much blood was ſpilt in diſputes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing its meaning.</p>
            <p>Beſides the danger of an indefinite dependance upon an undetermined power, it might be worth while to conſider what the characters are on whom we are ſo ready to acknowledge ourſelves dependant. The votaries for this idol tell us, upon the good peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of our Mother Country, whom they repreſent as the moſt juſt, humane, and affectionate friends we can have in the world. Were this true, it were ſome encouragement; but who can pretend ignorance that theſe juſt and humane friends are as much under the tyranny of men of a reverſe character as we ſhould be, could thoſe miſcreants gain their ends? I diſclaim any more than a mutual dependance on any man, or number of men upon earth; but ah indefinite depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance upon a combination of men, who have, in the face of the ſun, broken thro' the moſt ſolemn cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nants, debauched the hereditary, and corrupted the elective guardians of the people's rights, who have, in fact, eſtabliſhed an abſolute tyranny in Great-Britain and Ireland, and openly declared themſelves <hi>competent to bind the Coloniſts in all caſes whatſoever:</hi> I ſay indefinite de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on ſuch a combination of <hi>uſurping innovators</hi> is evidently as dangerous to liberty, as fatal to civil and ſocial happineſs, as any one ſtep that could be propoſed, even by the <hi>deſtroyer of men.</hi> The utmoſt that the honeſt party in Great-Britain can do, is to warn us to avoid this dependance at all hazards? Does not even a Duke of Grafton declare the miniſterial meaſures illegal and dangerous? And ſhall America, no way connected with this adminiſtration, preſs our ſubmiſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:043053_0005_101CB15D9EAB9FA0"/>
to ſuch meaſures, and reconciliation to the authors of them? Would not ſuch pigeon-hearted wretches equally forward the recal of the Stuart family, and the eſtabliſhment of Popery throughout Chriſtendom, did they conceive the party in favor of thoſe loyal meaſures the ſtrongeſt? Shame on the men who can court exemption from preſent trouble and expence, at the price of their own and poſterity's liberty! The honeſt party in England cannot wiſh for the reconci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liation propoſed. It is as unſafe to them as to us, and they thoroughly apprehend it. What check have they now upon the crown, and what ſhadow of control can they pretend, when the crown can com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand fifteen or twenty millions a year, which they have nothing to ſay to? A proper proportion of our commerce is all that can benefit any good man in Britain or Ireland, and God forbid we ſhould be ſo cruel as to furniſh bad men with power to enſlave both Britain and America. Adminiſtration has now fairly diſſevered the dangerous tie: Execrated will he be by the lateſt poſterity who again joins the fatal co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>d! But ſay the puling puſillanimous cowards, we ſhall be ſubject to a long and bloody war, if we declare inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance. On the contrary, I affirm it the only ſtep that can bring the conteſt to a ſpeedy and happy iſſue. By declairing independance we place ourſelves on a footing for an equal negociation: Now we are called a pack of villainous rebels, who, like the St. Vincent Indians, can expect nothing more than a pardon for our lives, and the ſovereign favor, reſpecting freedom and property, <hi>to be at the King's will.</hi> Grant Almighty God that I may be numbered with the dead before that fable day dawn on North-America!</p>
            <p>All Europe knows the illegal and inhuman treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment we have received from Britons. All Europe Wiſhes the haughty empreſs of the main reduced to
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:043053_0006_101CB15F2DEAF970"/>
a more humble deportment. After herſelf has thruſt her Colonies from her, the maritime powers cannot be ſuch idiots as to ſuffer her to reduce them to a more abſolute obedience of her dictates than they were here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore obliged to yield. Does not the moſt ſuperfici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al politician know that while we profeſs ourſelves the ſubjects of Great-Britain, and yet hold arms againſt her, they have a right to treat us as rebels, and that according to the laws of nature and nations no other ſtate has a right to interfere in the diſpute? But on the other hand, on our declaration of independance, the maratime ſtates at leaſt will find it their intereſt, which always ſecures the queſtion of inclination, to protect a people who can be ſo advantageous to them. So that thoſe ſhort-ſighted politicians, who conclude that this ſtep will involve us in ſlaughter and devaſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, may plainly perceive that no meaſure in our power will ſo naturally and effectually work our deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verance. The motion of a ſinger of the Grand Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narch would procure as gentle a temper in the Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potent Britiſh Miniſter as appeared in the Manilla ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſom and Falkland iſlands affairs. From without cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly we have every thing to hope, nothing to fear; from within, ſome tell us the Préſbyterians, if freed from the reſtraining power of Great-Britain, would over-run the peceable Quakers in this government. For my own part, I deſpiſe and deteſt the bickerings of ſectaries, and am apprehenſive of no trouble from that quarter, eſpecially while no peculiar honors nor emoluments are annexed to either. I heartily wiſh too many of the Quakers did not give cauſe of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, by endeavoring to counteract the meaſures of their fellow citizens for the common ſafety. If they profeſs themſelves only pilgrims here, let them walk through the men of this world without interfering with their actions on either ſide. If they would not
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:043053_0007_101CB164D9BD7A40"/>

            <p>TO acknowledge that the Creator formed Man for ſociety, and that ſociety cannot ſubſiſt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out regulations, laws, and government; and at the ſame time to aſſert, that in ſpight of all human care to prevent it, every government will degenerate into a tyranny, is ſuch a daring <hi>blaſphemy</hi> of the <hi>divine at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute,</hi> that had I not heard it aſſerted, and acquieſced in as a truth, I could not have believed ſuch a poſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on could have obtained in a civilized country! This monſtrous hypotheſis concludes that notwithſtanding the Deity had power enough to form ſuch admirable creatures as men and women, and fit them for enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:043053_0008_101CB16697F76BF8"/>
of each other a thouſand ways, and tho' by means of the moſt exquiſite of thoſe enjoyments a race ſhould ariſe from them over which every power of rightful government muſt of neceſſity be exerciſed, yet juſt and rightful government is in reality utopian, imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and impracticable! Did not God cloath the graſs, direct the wild Goat and provide for the Sparrow, I might more eaſily be perſuaded to ſuſpect his care of Man.</p>
            <p>I readily grant that the delegates of governmental power are too apt to conſider themſelves the poſſeſſors of it <hi>in their own right,</hi> and that they therefore take every means in their power to become the <hi>maſters</hi> in place of <hi>ſervants</hi> to their <hi>conſtituents;</hi> and that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in all civilized countries have been too inattentive to the uſerpations of their rulers: But I conceive of no cauſe in the nature of things which ſo abſolutely counteracts the power of a wiſe, learned, and free community as to render it impoſſible for them to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their liberty. The arguments brought from the condition of other ſtates, are by no means concluſive with reſpect to the North-American colonies. I am hold to aſſert, that ſuch a favourable combination of circumſtances as they are bleſſed with at this impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant conjuncture, never did take place among any people with whom hiſtory has made us acquainted. The moſt juſt and ſolid foundation of ſocial happineſs was laid in the firſt ſettlement of the Continent, <hi>the cultivation of the earth for the ſubſiſtance of its proprietor.</hi> Here was no feudal tenure from ſome military Lord; every cultivator being the lord of his own ſoil, and content with its produce, had no thoughts of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croaching upon and ſubjecting his neighbour to his abſolute dominion. Hence a handſome competency has enabled the bulk of the people to give their chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſuch an education as enables them to read, and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:043053_0009_101CB16A2AE49F10"/>
become acquainted with the uſurpations of the deepeſt plotters of their ruin. The ſpirit of the people for obtaining this neceſſary information, is evident from the incredible number of news-papers and other peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>odical publications which they encourage, and the effect of ſuch inſtitutions never have been ſo great in any community, yet known, as in theſe <hi>pantaplebean (altogether</hi> Commons) colonies. How quickly the moſt important revolution of the fundamentals of our policy can pervade a continent, may be gueſſed at by the progreſs of the idea of Colonial Independancy in three weeks or a month at fartheſt! Surely thouſands and tens of thouſands of common farmers and tradeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men muſt be better reaſoners than ſome of our tram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>melled <hi>juris conſultors,</hi> who to this hour feel a reluct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to part with the abominable chain, which re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining, in any ſhape whatever, tho' modified by all the wiſdom and caution of the greateſt men now li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving, muſt in a very little time drag the colonies into the moſt abject ſlavery. Many profeſs themſelves zealous for the liberties of America, yet declare an abhorrence of the idea of independancy on Great-Britain. If this be not a ſoleciſm, as abſurd and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable as ever wad obtruded on mankind, I know not the meaning of the term! <hi>Civil Liberty</hi> never was defined in ſtricter terms than <hi>an</hi> EXEMPTION <hi>from all controul,</hi> WITHOUT THE COMMUNITY, <hi>in which every qualified member has an equal voice.</hi> No American, as ſuch, has the ſhadow of incorporation with the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of Great-Britain; and in conſequence, if he receives the leaſt ſyllable of law from that quarter, he gives up his claim to the definitive exemption. if the ſticklers for <hi>dependance</hi> do not mean dependance for ſome certain laws, in the forming of which the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loniſts have no voice at all, I do not yet underſtand them; and if they do mean that we ſhould admit the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:043053_0010_101CB16F2FC19600"/>
               <hi>claim</hi> of any ſtate, or any part of the power of any ſtate, with which the democratic power of this ſtate is not incorporated, to give us law <hi>in any caſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,</hi> they admit a fibre, which I muſt make free to tell them, will ſpeedily grown into an <hi>iron ſinew</hi> which neither themſelves nor poſterity will be able to endure or burſt aſunder. And further, it is not only the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſome poſſible law from a foreign power, that hurries a people into ſlavery; a meer negative power on acts for the repeal of grieveous laws will more ſlowly, but as certainly ſubvert liberty.</p>
            <p>Again Mr. Hume's obſervation, [<hi>Perfect Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth,</hi> p. 301.] that "the ſword being in the hands of a ſingle perſon who will <hi>always neglect to diſcipline the militia,</hi> in order to have the pretext to <hi>keep up a ſtanding army;"</hi> and the ſucceeding one, "that this is a mortal diſtemper in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> government of which it <hi>muſt, at laſt inevitably periſh,"</hi> now ſo fatally con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed, may be a ſufficient warning to the Colonies to <hi>beware of being again entangled with the yoke of bondage.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Many object to a Republican Government as im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>practicable in a large ſtate. "The contrary of this (ſays Hume, [<hi>Per. Com.</hi> 302.] ſeems evident. Tho' 'tis more difficult to form a Republican Government in an extenſive country than in a city; there is more facility, when once it is formed, of preſerving it ſteady and uniform, without tumult or faction, in the former then the latter. (<hi>Per. Com.</hi> 303.) In a large government which is modelled with maſterly ſkill, there is compaſs and room enough to refine the democracy from the lower people, who may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the firſt elections, or firſt concoction of the commonwealth; to the higher magiſtrates who direct all the motions. At the ſame time the parts are ſo diſtant and remote that 'tis very difficult either by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trigue, prejudice, or paſſion, to hurry them into mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:043053_0011_101CB170C50A8ED0"/>
againſt the public intereſt." Thus far Mr. Hume, whoſe plan for a perfect commonwealth, will ſpeedily be ſubmitted to public conſideration.</p>

               <hi>A Review of the American Conteſt, with ſome Strictures on the King's Speech, and its conſequences. Addreſſed to all Parents, in the Thirteen United Colonies. By a Friend to Poſterity and Mankind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>NATURE inſtructs the brute creation to provide for, guard and protect their offspring until they are able to do for themſelves. The dam is never known to forſake her young while her care is neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for their ſafety, nor to do any thing which would involve them in diſtreſs and difficulty. Man, who has this principle in common with brutes, is endowed with others yet more valuable, but which to him are abſolutely neceſſary, whereby he is taught to provide for the future welfare of his deſcendants and to guard them from the encroachments of that power which civil ſociety conſtitutes for its own ſafety; but which, through the depravity of human nature is often tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned againſt it. There are few parents who do not make it their conſtant ſtudy and earneſt endeavour to leave ſome valuable inheritance to their children: few who have been ſo loſt to the feelings of nature and calls of parental affection, as to entail difficulty and diſtreſs on their children, when it was in their power to leave them a fair and eaſy inheritance. And yet it has ſo happened, that by an ill timed attachment to the preſent, without paying proper attention to the future, they have entailed miſery upon them by the very means which were deſigned to preſerve them from it.</p>
            <p>It is now in your power to bequeath to your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren the one or the other, and it becomes you to have
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:043053_0012_101CB17850ACB510"/>
an eye to them in all your proceedings. It is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently known to you, that riches in arbitrary ſtates are often the ruin of then poſſeſſors, and that ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to property is abſolutely neceſſary to ſtamp their true value on wealth and poſſeſſions. He therefore, who wiſhes to leave his children in flouriſhing cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ought to be a zealous friend to thoſe mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures, and that plan of government which gives the greateſt ſecurity to property, and an active warm op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſer of thoſe which leave it to the arbitrary diſpoſal of men, who find a greater advantage in making free with what does not belong to them, than in frugally uſing what is juſtly their own. Whig and Tory ſhould be out of the queſtion. Private pique, party faction and animoſity ought to ſubſide. He who thinks ſhould think for poſterity, and he who acts ſhould act for his children.</p>
            <p>It is a great weakneſs to ſuffer our paſſions to take place of our reaſon and blindly to follow their dic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tates, though to our manifeſt hurt, rather than ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject them to our better ſenſe. A falſe pride, which will not acknowledge an error though ever ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, an obſtinate perſeverance in our own opinion without deigning to hear advice or inſtruction, and an unreaſonable attachment to party, have done much miſchief to mankind, and may yet do more if not carefully avoided. I have directed this paper to you in preference to others, becauſe your parental affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſhould form more than a counterpoiſe to every falſe principle, which can influence the human mind where the intereſt of your offspring is at ſtake.</p>
            <p>Our preſent conteſt is immenſely great, and every man muſt ſee that it will affect poſterity. Its conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences cannot end with itſelf; but the lateſt genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions muſt feel its effects. The great Ruler of the univerſe has permitted it for wiſe purpoſes and has
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:043053_0013_101CB179ED9F17A8"/>
called every one of us to act our part in it. It becomes us, therefore, laying aſide all former prejudices, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ality and party attachments, to act upon principles which will juſtify us to him who has aſſigned us our ſtations, and cauſe poſterity to bleſs the memory of their forefathers. We all agree in this, that Great-Britain is unjuſt and arbitrary, and we have hitherto principally differed in the mode of oppoſition, which ought to have been purſued. I ſpeak not to thoſe who think one way and talk another. They act up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch baſe principles, that it is in vain to attempt to rouze in them any juſt or generous ſentiments. We have no inſtances of the converſion of avaricious or ambitious hypocrites, and it would be waſting time to uſe arguments to convince them. I direct myſelf to you who have ſincerity ſufficient to examine the principles on which you proceed, and honeſty enough to purſue that courſe of conduct which appears to be right, and ſo much affection for your children as to prefer their intereſt and happineſs to every other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration. For you I mean to throw together a few hints which may aſſiſt you in finally fixing a right choice.</p>
            <p>The Britiſh adminiſtration began its attacks on our liberties with a ſtamp act, but meeting with ſtrong oppoſition they thought fit to repeal it. This act threw the colonies into ſtrong convulſions, and we rejoiced exceedingly on its repeal, and fondly hoped that we would enjoy future tranquility. But we were miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken. They never intended to relinquiſh the deſign, but only to change their ground, that which they firſt pitched upon not ſeeming tenable. An American re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue granted by a Britiſh Parliament was the object, and they never loſt ſight of it; for they ſoon renewed their attacks upon principles which they thought more favourable to their intentions; but meeting with as
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:043053_0014_101CB17C199944B8"/>
little ſucceſs in that, as in the preceding attempt, they ſuſpended their meaſures for a time, in, hopes of lul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling us into a careleſs ſecurity. They accordingly once more returned to the charge, and endeavoured to effect by cunning and artifice what they had here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tofore attempted in vain on every other peaceable plan. This not ſucceeding, they were reduced to their laſt ſhift of bullying and force; and this they reſolved upon. They levied armies, appointed Generals of reputation to command, and ſent them amongſt us, we may know their commiſſion by their conduct; for after abuſing, brow-beating and inſulting, after ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving and tarring and feathering, after offering every poſſible injury which a free people could bear, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out obtaining their ends, and every other meaſure failing, they drew the ſword, and at once reduced us to the dire alternative of ſubmitting to their illegal claims of juriſdiction, or entering into the bloody con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt. Like men determined to be free we choſe the latter. It now reſts on the laſt argument, an argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which finally ſettles all controverſies of a like nature. The plan of operation is now opened, and they who ſtand to it with the moſt ſteady perſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance muſt finally ſucceed. This is the decree of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence in all caſes, <q>he that perſevereth unto the end ſhall be ſaved.</q> We have, by the bleſſing of God, effectually baffled all their former attempts; but if we fail in this, all our former victories will only ſerve to make our fall the more conſpicuous and terrible.</p>
            <p>I will not enquire what would have been the efficacy of any heretofore recommended, but untried means. The worſt that can has happened, and it is with it we have now to deal; to relinquiſh it on our part, would be to give up the matter, for however any means might once have done, cowardice alone would now deſert the field, and ſlavery muſt be the inevitable conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:043053_0015_101CB17E2CE6F6F0"/>
I do not wonder that war ſits heavy on us, and that we are ſomewhat reſtleſs and uneaſy; but I ſhall be ſurprized, if we, who have ſo long and ſo ſuceſsfully oppoſed tyranny and oppreſſion ſhould all on a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den loſe every deſire of retaining our liberties. I am forced into this remark by the artful, cunning and deſigning manner in which ſome men talk of a recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation with Great Britain; and the bug-bears they conjure up to frighten the timid, irreſolute and igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant, from a ſteady proſecution of thoſe means, which alone can help us in our preſent circumſtances. Facts bear evidence from the beginning of the conteſt that every ſcheme they ever recommended has, upon trial, proved inadequate to the end for which it was inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded; yet they proceed. Beware of ſuch men, they love neither their country, nor their liberties, ſo much as ſomething elſe.</p>
            <p>There are many I doubt not who are denominated Tories by the more zealous Whigs, who in their hearts wiſh ſucceſs to our meaſures, tho' they maybe chagrined becauſe thoſe they propoſed did not go down with the people; theſe are uniform, open, and not very dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous; but there are others, who under the cloke of friendſhip for the cauſe, harbour the bittereſt ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour and malice in their hearts. Theſe talk favoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly in general, though their diſcourſes moſtly termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate with a <hi>doubt, ſuſpicion,</hi> or <hi>but,</hi> which give thoſe with whom they converſe, reaſon to dread ſome hid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den deſign, or approaching evil, which moſt men have not properly attended to. They artfully recal your attention to a certain period, when all was peace and quietneſs, and by pathetically lamenting the unhappy alteration, endeavour to impreſs your minds with an opinion that all our troubles aroſe from ourſelves. They carefully avoid mentioning the iniquitous mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures of the Britiſh government which produced them,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:043053_0016_101CB184675630C0"/>
and by keeping thoſe out of ſight, they gradually lead the unwary into the belief, that the men who have been moſt active on the preſent occaſion in oppoſing the tyrannical proceedings of Great-Britain, and who have hazarded their all in defence of their country, have been actuated by ſiniſter motives in all they have done. If every man who hears ſuch inſinuations were to aſk thoſe who caſt them out, what meaſures have not the men they condemn tried at one time or ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to avoid the preſent conteſt, and ſave our liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? What advantages they can reap by a ſucceſsful end of it, which every other freeman on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent will not reap equally with them? And in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſucceſsful cloſe of it, all will allow they muſt be the greateſt ſufferers. Their lives muſt go, let who will elſe eſcape. Theſe queſtions might recal them to facts, and theſe facts would enable men to judge aright.</p>
            <p>Honeſty could not ſtand the force of a few perti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent queſtions, but theſe men have taken their leave of it, and like Manaſſeh of old, have ſold themſelves to do wickedly. Were it not ſo, could it be poſſible for them in the face of the ſun, to charge all our trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles on the New-England Preſbyterians, troubles which originally began and have all along been kept up by a wicked adminiſtration and a venal parliament. To make them the hatchers of miſchiefs occaſioned by unconſtitutional acts of parliament, and the only fomenters of our juſt oppoſition with a Pennſylvani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Quaker, a Maryland and a Virginian Churchman did more to effect than all the other men on the conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent put together, is cruelty in the extreme. My heart bleeds when I think of ſuch men; who would fell the whole continent and all the blood on it for private advantage, and with whom a few thouſand, guineas with a title would be eſteemed an equivalent for the lives, liberty and property of the freemen of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:043053_0017_101CB18759B78EA0"/>
a colony. May that God who ſees how little they can gain, it ſucceſsful, open their eyes and turn their hearts, e'er they be convinced by fatal experience, that he who purchaſes the whole world at the price of his ſoul, is a very unwiſe dealer, and makes but a poor bargain in the end. if the calls of virtue, the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts of religion, and dictates of patriotiſm cannot awaken them to a ſenſe of their duty, yet Norfolk might open their eyes. But let them do as they pleaſe, we ought to act wiſely. If we do not make ſuch a ſettlement now as will ſecure the privileges we contend for to poſterity, we entail either ſlavery or a civil war on our children. This is certain, let what will be doubtful. Look round you then, view your offsprings and tell me, are you willing to leave them ſuch a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gacy? Do not trifle on this occaſion, all your other legacies muſt derive their true value from the part you now take in this conteſt. Thintk not that the God who charges him with worſe than infidelity who provides not for his own, and thoſe of his houſhold, will juſtify you in returning to the ſtate you were in when our troubles began, and thereby delivering over your offspring to the miſchievous machinations of at power that from the beginning has ſet right, juſtice, and mercy at defiance, and in all her deliberations conſidered nothing but her ability to execute.</p>
            <p>Look to the year 1763, that happy period, as many ſo fondly call it, and ſee what ſafety there is to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica in ſuch a ſituation. Lord North has ſaid, <q>If that is all they want, we are agreed;</q> and the ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing pleaſes many of you. His Lordſhip, like others, who have learned wiſdom by experience, wiſhes to have all to begin again, believing that he could more eaſily effect his purpoſe by other means than thoſe he is at preſent purſuing. Swallow the bait and you are undone forever.</p>

Can any man in his ſenſes believe, that he who has ſo long, and ſo invariably purſued his point againſt the ſenſe of the beſt men in the nation, will finally deſert his maſter's moſt favourite ſcheme ſo eaſily? Has he uttered a ſingle ſyllable that can make the moſt cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulous believe that he is convinced of the injuſtice of his conduct? He confeſſes he was deceived; but wherein lay the deception: In believing that fewer troops would effect a ſubmiſſion than he is now con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced muſt be employed. Here lay the deception he complains of, and he is therefore determined to ſend his terms with ſuch an armed force; as he expects will frighten you into a compliance. Does this look like the conduct of one who deſigns to relinquiſh his claims? Were he or his maſter ſenſible of the injuſtice of their proceedings &amp; the wrongs they have done us, they would both ſpeak a very different language. Why does he call you rebels? Why call in foreign troops to his aid? Why does his maſter lament ſo pathetically, that the extenſive operations of the war he means to carry on againſt you, will exhauſt his funds and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the public debts, while he has not a ſingle tear to ſhed, not a groan, nor as much as a ſigh for all the blood he has already ſpilt, and yet means to ſpill, if he wiſhes to allow you ſecurity to your privileges? Oh! George! The day thou utteredſt that ſentiment in the face of the ſun, thou gaveſt up all title to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. <q>Among the many unavoidable ill conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of this rebellion, none affects me more ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly,</q> ſays the King. <q>than the extraordinary bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then it muſt create to my faithful ſubjects,</q> "Moſt humane Prince! moſt pious Sovereign! moſt affectio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate father of thy people! an addition to thy Britiſh ſubjects burthens to obtain a moſt unrighteous pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of thy own, affects thee in order to reconcile them to the bearing of it; but to ſpill the blood of
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:043053_0019_101CB1915E99EC60"/>
thy oppreſſed American ſubjects diſturbs not thy guiltleſs conſcience! Let me tell thee, O King, that there is a God who ſees through the veil that covers thy deceit, and who hears the cry of the needy, and regards the prayer of the diſtreſſed, who will recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence vengeance on the wicked, though ſupported by the power of Great Britain. Our weakneſs is ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent in his hands for the purpoſe. If thine and thy miniſters intentions are not evil againſt us, why didſt thou not hearken to the repeated prayers of thy diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed ſubjects in America? why doſt thou not recal thy troops, repeal the acts, indemnify us for what we have ſuffered, and offer any further ſecurity to our rights, which we may think neceſſary? Thou began<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt the attack and this is thy duty; beſides, thou haſt an obedient parliament, which diſputes not thy will, and all this is in thy power, and in no one's elſe." Had the King made a ſpeech to the houſe recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe things, he would have given unequivocal proof of his honeſt intentions, and it might juſtly be termed gracious. But who can truſt a Prince, who while he ſpeaks the language of peace and humanity with his lips, has nothing but cruelty and war in his conduct. The man who does, may have the inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of the dove, but he cannot be poſſeſſed or the wiſdom of the ſerpent. I conclude by entreating you, that as you love your children, and their happineſs, you never deſert your preſent oppoſition, until you obtain ſuch a plan of conſtitutional vigour, as ſhall put it at all times in your power to ſecure yourſelves, and your deſcendants from tyrannical encroachments. This you never had, nor never can have on the plan of your former dependance.

            <p>YOU are the miniſter of the American depart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. You have the character of a religious man, a rare virtue in a modern ſtateſman. It has be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come my duty and intereſt to addreſs you, on the preſent circumſtances of affairs in America. I know the Americans well; their ſtrongeſt and ruling paſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was their affection to their mother country; the honour, the glory of Great Britain they eſteemed as their greateſt happineſs; a large portion of the ſame affection remains; nothing but repeated injuries and injuſtice could have leſſened it. My Lord from a wanton and avaricious exercise of power, the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtry of Great Britain have heaped injuries on the heads of the Americans, that no one period of hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry can parellel.</p>
            <p>The practice of the Egyptians in ſmothering the children of the Iſraelites in the birth, the ſwords of Cortez and Pizarro, who ſlew millions of innocent Mixicans and Peruvians, the dreadful famine brought by the Eaſt India Company upon the poor Eaſt-Indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans muſt all be brought into one ſcale, to ſerve as any ſort of balance to the ſyſtem of deſolation, that you
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:043053_0021_101CB19A0AB47E68"/>
and your brother miniſters, are meditating and daily practiſing againſt the unhappy people of North America.</p>
            <p>The elements, which the providence of God hath given for all his creatures, you have the preſumption to deprive them of, Fire, ſword, famine, and deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſhew the vicinity of your fleets and armies; children and ſervants are animated to riſe and ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter their benefactors. No ſpecies of cruelty, which the wit or malice of man or devils could adviſe, but are practiſed againſt the Americans.</p>
            <p>Do you believe in God, my Lord, and direct theſe things? Do you believe that God made America as well as Great Britain? If you do, ponder, conſider well, what anſwer you will give if you eſcape puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in this world, when you come to be queſtioned before the Throne of God, for the deſtruction you have made of his creatures, the work of his hands, to whom he granted life and liberty, earth, air and water equally as to yourſelf; and yet preſumptuous man, you have dared to counteract his providence! Have you conſcience my Lord? If you have, I would not for the empire of a thouſand worlds be Lord Dart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth? But, my Lord, it is not to awaken your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience <hi>only</hi> that I write you this letter: the flame of civil war, by your management, hath extended far and wide in America; battles have been fought, numbers have been ſlain, and priſoners taken on both ſides; the Americans have in their poſſeſſion ten for one, and among them many men of rank, Preſcot, Preſton, Stopford and others; they are all treated with tenderneſs and regard, while the priſoners you have taken are treated with ſeverity, carried to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land in irons, there, as it is ſaid, to be tried, and of courſe condemned and executed, or in other words, under form of law murdered!</p>

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:043053_0022_101CB19EEC3D3200"/>
My Lord, if there be any thing on earth or in hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven that you reſpect, avoid that rock—You have Col. Allen, Capt. Martindale and ſome other priſoners—the hour that it is known here that any of thoſe pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoners are executed, the priſoners here will be ſacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced—nay more, every Engliſh and Scots adherent;—dread ſhun, and for ever abandon ſuch murderous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentions.—The cries and vengeance of all the relati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of thoſe whole blood ſhall be ſhed in this manner will ſurround you, death and horror will be your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant companions, and the torments of the damned, even on earth, will await you.</p>
            <p>My Lord, this is but the beginning of ſorrows. Take in good part what I write. It is truth, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for the benefit of Britain and America.</p>

               <hi>Obſervations on</hi> LORD NORTH'S <hi>Conciliatory</hi> PLAN.</head>
            <p>I CANNOT recal an idea to my mind more amaz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly abſurd and ſtupid than the idea of Lord North's ſecond attempt to gull the Coloniſts into a belief of his inclination to hold out to them terms of a ſafe and amicable reconciliation with Great Britain. No one is ignorant that the Americans have offered every thing that can poſſibly be deviſed to bury the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jurious &amp; enſlaving claim of adminiſtration, in perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual oblivion, and leave matters on the ſame footing they were before the pretence was held up. Thoſe generous propoſals, however often repeated, have as often been rejected with an inſolent contempt, and yet the <hi>profound politician</hi> tells his oponents in the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh Houſe of Commons, that he is heartily inclined to a reconciliation with the Colonies, and willing to put them in the ſituation they ſo paſſionately deſire;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:043053_0023_101CB1A4A45F3010"/>
that is, ſays he, to a courtier demanding explanation, <hi>in a ſtate of abſolute dependance on the Britiſh Parliament in all caſes whatſoever;</hi> for, ſays his Lordſhip, they were unqueſtionably thus dependant in 1763. Had his Lordſhip entirely forgot the ſucceſs of his former experiment, perhaps a trial of the ſame wretched <hi>trick</hi> over again, might have appeared leſs rediculous. I may indeed ſay, leſs inſulting to the loweſt under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. I would aſk the moſt credulous votary for making up the diſpute, what <hi>poſſible grounds</hi> they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to found their expectation of a permanent recon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciliation upon? Has any thing lately turned up, which has indicated a change of diſpoſition in the Prince or his favorites? Can a majority, which have been ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red from one ſeven years to another, by pure force of corruption, be depended on to remain firm to a ſlaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering, plundering and deſolating court, and ſhare the deteſtation of preſent and future ages, for mere no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? Has the court reſolved to caſt Bernard, Hutch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inſon and daughter, Richardſon the Murderer, cra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zy John Malcom, and Richardſon the recent volunteer, out on the common? I tell you, nay! You have a freſh inſtance of the firmneſs of the cabinet, in adding another three thouſand pound penſioner to the liſt, in conjuncture, when all mankind will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs there is need of ſaving. Theſe burthen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome penſions muſt come from ſome part of the dominions! If Great-Britain and Ireland have conceived ſuch a mortal hatred to America, that they can hug her moſt inveterate enemies in their boſoms, and vote them ſuch munificent rewards for drawing her into ſo deſtructive a civil war, we cannot be ſafe in the power of ſuch enemies. If they abound in reſources as largely as Mr. Wedderburne and others boaſt they do, let them ceaſe complaining of their poverty, and contentedly diſcharge their own
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:043053_0024_101CB1A645363A80"/>
national debt, rather than go on augmenting is by their efforts to ſaddle it, with an unlimited penſion liſt, on America. Does the nation bear the weight of the preſent unnatural quarrel with America on other terms, than a firm aſſurance of the Court, that millions of leading men's dependant's ſhall be provided for in America, for whom places can by no means be found at home. Is not the very genius of the people of Great-Britain and Ireland corrupted, inſomuch, that the views of young fellows of education, or any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with men of note, are altogether ſet on pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic money? Can our peaceable men indulge a gleam of hope, that this humour will alter, or that youths, bred in idleneſs and diſſipation, will become induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and diſintereſted patriots? If not, they muſt then be ſo weak as to conceit, that miniſters will become leſs fond of fingering the public money, and ſecuring themſelves in places of power and profit by means of it; indeed, that they will become more honeſt and ſaving of the national money than thoſe the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution has appointed as a check upon them. It is no wonder they tell of ſending a formidable fleet and army to bring over their terms of reconciliation, when they are in no one article different from the terms they firſt aimed to impoſe. Had the miniſter, or more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly the obſtinate author of all our troubles, had the remoteſt idea of favouring us with a government of laws, which had any reſpect to the ſecurity of our lives and properties, he had long ſince granted with a good grace, petitions, made and repeated with the moſt dutiful and perſevering affection, which aſked for nothing more! <hi>Sed aut Caeſar aut nullus,</hi> ſeems the unalterable determination of the man, who ſoothed our already elated expectations, by an inaugural de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration, that he <hi>gloried</hi> in the name of Briton, at that time, a diſtinctive characteriſtic of the patrons of uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:043053_0025_101CB1A7D9CB5138"/>
liberty. If therefore the whole body of the governing, and influential part of the governed in Great Britain, be unalterably ſet upon extorting tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute from the Colonies; and the better to ſecure the collection of it, claims right to impoſe the laws, and executors of thoſe laws, dependant only on themſelves for appointment, continuance and ſupport; and all theſe to be extended at their ſole pleaſure, it may rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily be determined in what condition, the abſolutely paſſive ſubjects of ſuch an unnatural uſurpation would quickly be. It is evident they have concluded on two things, viz. to make a bold puſh for our entire ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection, as their ends would be thereby more readily anſwered; but that being found impracticable, we are to be tried with negociation, in which all the craft, duplicity and punic faith of adminiſtration is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. Pray God it may be wiſely and firmly guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed againſt! The worthy and honourable John Collins, <abbr>Eſq</abbr>; of New-Port, Rhode Iſland, on the arrival of Lord North's laſt conciliatory plan, obſerved, that not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the expoſure of his large ſtate, to what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever depredations the enemy ſaw fit to make upon it, he was more concerned for the probable ſucceſs of their arts than arms. Had the Americans in general the wiſdom and firmneſs of that gentleman matters would not have come to the preſent melancholy lengths we find them. However, in the great and general plan of him who putteth down and ſetteth up ſtates, this is doubtleſs an indiſpenſible part, and therefore not to be complained of; but it has amazed me to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template the numerous inſtances of diſappointment our enemies have met with, in every plot they have laid for our deſtruction. How did Bernard and Hutchinſon flatter themſelves with the number of friends they had in ſeveral towns of the Maſſachuſetts, and thought that a very trifling force, from the other
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:043053_0026_101CB1AD1BBC6338"/>
ſide of the water, added to their minions, dependants and expectants, would cruſh a little turbulent faction, who diſturbed their darling meaſures? Certainly men intoxicated with a luſt of abſolute power found ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the appearance of things to tole them on to an object ſo grateful to their fondeſt wiſhes; other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe they would have been contented to augment and confirm their power by ſuch unperceived degrees that the <hi>happy days,</hi> many tell us we have enjoyed under a continual invading uſurpation, would not yet have been ſo ſenſibly interrupted. No leſs has the ſo often extolled Gov. Try on been diſappointed in his benevolent intentions reſpecting New-York. His band on Long Iſland, and on the eaſt ſide of Hudſon's river, with Sir John Johnſon among his vaſſals, and the Indians, gave him great hopes of having matters in a fine train be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the invincible armada arrived in the ſpring; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of which, it is probable the active General Lee will ſo fortify that place, that all the force they can ſend againſt it, will be inſufficient to reduce it. Dun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more, with all his wanton ravage, has done little more than exaſperate the Virginians, and convinced that brave colony, that they can be formidable to ſavages on the eaſt, as well as weſt ſide of their dominion. Carleton's Canadians, make no ſuch figure in the harrangues of the penſioner, as they did laſt year; and in caſe foreigners are to be procured to be poured in upon us, the greateſt oppoſers of our total ſeparation from Britain acknowledge, they would then no longer defer a declaration of independancy, and application to other powers for their protection. To this the whole ſcene appears rapidly advancing, in my view, as haſtily as infinite wiſdom thinks proper to conduct it; and if this be his moſt gracious deſign, he will work, and none ſhall hinder. Amen, Beneficent Jehovah! Amen. <hi>Sic ſperat.</hi>

            <head>COMMON SENSE. APPENDIX TO COMMON SENSE. <hi>The neceſſity of</hi> INDEPENDANCY.</head>
            <p>SINCE the publication of the firſt edition of this pamphlet, or rather on the ſame day on which it came out, the King's Speech made its appearance in this city. Had the ſpirit of prophecy directed the birth of this production, it could not have brought it forth, at a more ſeaſonable juncture, or a more neceſſary time. The bloody mindedneſs of the one ſhew the neceſſity of purſuing the doctrine of the other. Men read by way of revenge. And the Speech, inſtead of terrifying, prepared a way for the manly principles of Independance.</p>
            <p>Ceremony, and even ſilence, from whatever mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive they may ariſe, have a hurtful tendency, when they give the leaſt degree of countenance to baſe and wicked performances; wherefore, if this maxim be admitted, it naturally follows, that the King's Speech, as being a piece of finiſhed villainy, deſerved, and ſtill deſerves, a general execration, both by the Congreſs and the people. Yet, as the domeſtic tranquility of a nation, depends greatly on the <hi>chaſtity</hi> of what may properly be called NATIONAL MANNERS, it is often better, to paſs ſome things over in ſilent diſdain, than to make uſe of ſuch new methods of diſlike, as might introduce the leaſt inovation, on that guardian of our peace and ſafety. And perhaps, it is chiefly owing to this prudent delicacy, that the King's Speech hath not, before now, ſuffered a public execution. The ſpeech
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:043053_0028_101CB1B44BA8ECA0"/>
if it may be called one, is nothing better than a wilful audacious libel againſt the truth, the common good, and the exiſtence of mankind; and is a formal and pompous method of offering up human ſacrifices, to the pride of tyrants. But this general maſſacre of mankind, is one of the privileges, and the certain con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of king's; for as nature knows them <hi>not,</hi> they know <hi>not her,</hi> and although they are beings of our <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> creating they know not <hi>us,</hi> and are become the gods of their creators. The ſpeech hath one good quality, which is, that it is not calculated to deceive, neither can we, even if we would, be deceived by it. Brutality and tyranny appear on the face of it. It leaves us at no loſs: And every line convinces, even in the moment of reading, that he, who hunts the woods for prey, the naked and untutored Indian, is leſs a ſavage than the King of Britain.</p>
            <p>Sir John Dalrymple, the putative father of a whining Jeſuitical piece, fallaciouſly called, <hi>"The addreſs of the people of</hi> England, <hi>to the Inhabitants of</hi> America," hath, perhaps, from a vain ſuppoſition, that the people <hi>here</hi> went to be frightened at the pomp and deſcription of a king giving, (though very unwiſely on his part) the real character of the preſent one: "But," ſays the writer, "if you are inclined to pay compliments to an adminiſtration which we do not complain of, (mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Marquis of Rockingham's at the repeal of the Stamp act, it is very unfair in you to withhold them from that prince <hi>by whoſe</hi> NOD ALONE, <hi>they were <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

and contemptibly crawl through the world like a worm.</p>
            <p>However, it matters very little now, what the king of England either ſays or does; he hath wickedly broken though every moral and human obligation, tramp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led nature and conſcience beneath his feet; and by a ſteady and conſtitutional ſpirit of inſolence and cruel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, procured for himſelf an univerſal hatred. It is <hi>now</hi> the intereſt of America to provide for herſelf. She hath already a large and young family, whom it is more her duty to take care of, than to be granting away her property, to ſupport a power, who is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come a reproach to the names of men and chriſtians, YE, whoſe office it is to watch over the morals of a nation, of whatſoever ſect or denomination ye are of, as well as ye, who, are more immediately the guardi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans of the public liberty, if ye wiſh to preſerve your native country uncontaminated by European corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ye muſt in ſecret wiſh a ſeperation—But leaving the moral part to private reflection, I ſhall chiefly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine my farther remarks to the following heads:</p>
            <p>Firſt, That it is the intereſt of America, to be ſepe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated from Britain.</p>
            <p>Secondly; Which is the eaſieſt and moſt practicable plan, reconciliation or independance? with ſome occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſional remarks.</p>
            <p>In ſupport of the firſt, I could, if I judged it pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, produce the opinion of ſome of the ableſt and moſt experienced men on this continent; and whoſe ſentiments, on that head, are not yet publicly known. It is in reality a ſelf evident poſition: For no nation, in a ſtate of foreign dependance, limited in its com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, and cramped and ſettered in its legiſlative powers, can ever arrive at at any material eminence. America doth not yet know what opulence is; and although the progreſs which ſhe hath made, ſtands unparalleled in the hiſtory of other nations, it is but
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:043053_0030_101CB1B91988AEA0"/>
childhood, compared with what ſhe would be capable of arriving at, had ſhe, as ſhe ought to have, the legiſlative powers in her own hands. England, is at this time, proudly coveting what would do her no good, were ſhe to accompliſh it; and the continent heſitating on a matter, which will be her final ruin if neglected. It is the commerce, and not the conqueſt of America, by which England is to be benefited, and that would in a great meaſure continue, were the countries as independant of each other as France and Spain; becauſe in many articles, neither can go to a better market But it is the independance of this country on Britain or any other, which is now the main and only object worthy of contention, and which, like all other truths diſcovered by neceſſity, will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear clearer and ſtronger every day.</p>
            <p>Firſt. Becauſe it will come to that one time or other.</p>
            <p>Secondly. Becauſe the longer it is delayed, the harder, it will be to accompliſh.</p>
            <p>I have frequently amuſed myſelf both in public and private companies, with ſilently remarking the ſpecious errors of thoſe who ſpeak without reflecting. And among the many which I have heard, the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſeems the moſt general, viz. that had this rupture happened forty or fifty years hence, inſtead of <hi>now,</hi> the Continent would have been more able to have ſhaken off the dependance. To which I reply, that our military ability <hi>at this time,</hi> ariſes from the experience gained in the laſt war, and which in forty or fifty years time, would have been totally extinct. The Continent would not, by that time, have had a General, or even a military officer left; and we, or thoſe who may ſucceed us, would have been as ignorant of martial matters as the ancient Indians: And this ſingle poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, cloſely attended to, will unanſwerably prove,
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:043053_0031_101CB1BCA0F604D0"/>
that the preſent time is preferable to all others: The argument turns thus: At the concluſion of the laſt war, we had experience, but wanted numbers; and forty or fifty years hence, we ſhould have numbers, without experience; wherefore, the proper point of time, muſt be ſome particular point between the two extremes, in which a ſufficiency of the former remains, and a proper encreaſe of the latter is obtained: And that point of time is the preſent time.</p>
            <p>The reader will pardon this digreſſion, as it does not properly come under the head I firſt ſet out with, and to which I again return by the following poſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, viz.</p>
            <p>Should affairs be patched up with Britain, and ſhe to remain the governing and ſovereign power of America, (which as matters are now circumſtanced, is giving up the point entirely) we ſhall deprive our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves of the very means of ſinking the debt we have, or may contract. The value of the back lands, which ſome of the provinces are clandeſtinely deprived of, by the unjuſt extention of the limits of Canada, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lued only at five pounds ſterling per hundred acres, amount to upwards of twenty five millions, Pennſyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania currency; and the quit-rents at one penny ſterling per acre, to two millions yearly.</p>
            <p>It is by the ſale of thoſe lands, that the debt may be ſunk, without burthen to any, and the quit-rent reſerved thereon, will always leſſen, and in time will wholly ſupport the yearly expence of government. It matters not now long the debt is in paying, ſo that the lands when ſold, be applied to the diſcharge of it, and for the execution of which, the Congreſs for the time being, will be the continental truſtees.</p>
            <p>I proceed now to the ſecond head, viz. Which is the eaſieſt and moſt practicable plan, <hi>Reconciliation or Independance;</hi> with ſome occaſional remarks.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:043053_0032_101CB1C1F3C789F8"/>
He who takes nature for his guide, is not eaſily beaten out of his argument, and on that ground, I anſwer <hi>generally, That</hi> independance <hi>being a</hi> ſingle ſimple line, <hi>contained within ourſelves; and reconciliation, a matter exceedingly, perplexed and complicated, and in which, a treacherous capricious court is to interfere, gives the anſwer without a doubt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The preſent ſtate of America is truly alarming to every man who is capable of reflection. Without law, without government, without any other mode of power than what is founded on, and granted by courteſy. Held together by an unexampled concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of ſentiment, which, is nevertheleſs ſubject to change, and which, every ſecret enemy is endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to diſſolve. Our preſent condition, is, Legiſlation without law; wiſdom without a plan; a conſtitution without a name; and, what is ſtrangely aſtoniſhing, perfect Independance contending for dependance. The inſtance is without a precedent; the caſe never exiſted before; and who can tell what may be the event? The property of no man is ſecure in the preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braced ſyſtem of things. The mind of the multitude is left at random, and ſeeing no fixed object before them, they purſue ſuch as fancy or opinion ſtarts. Nothing is criminal; there is no ſuch thing as treaſon; wherefore, every one thinks himſelf at liberty to act as he pleaſes. The Tories would not have dared to aſſemble offenſively had they known that their lives, by that act, were forfeited to the laws of the ſtate. A line of diſtinction ſhould be drawn, between Engliſh ſoldiers taken in battle, and inhabitants of America taken in arms. The firſt are priſoners, but the latter traitors.

to diffentions. The Continental Belt is too looſely buckled. And if ſomething is not done in time, it will be too late to do any thing, and we ſhall fall into a ſtate, in which, neither <hi>Reconciliation</hi> nor <hi>Independance</hi> will be practicable. The king and his worthleſs adherents are got at the old game of dividing the Continent, and there are not wanting a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us, Printers, who will be buſy in ſpreading ſpecious falſehoods. The artful and hypocritical letter, which appeared a few months ago, in two of the New-York papers, and likewiſe in two others, is an evidence, that there are men who want either judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment or honeſty.</p>
            <p>It is eaſy getting into holes and corners, and talking of reconciliation: But do ſuch men ſeriouſly conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, how difficult the talk is, and how dangerous it may prove, ſhould the Continent divide thereon.

            <p>Put us, ſay ſome, upon the footing we were on in ſixty-three: To which I anſwer, the requeſt is not <hi>now</hi> in the power of Britain to comply with, neither will ſhe propoſe it; but it were, and even ſhould be granted, I aſk, as a reaſonable queſtion. By what means is ſuch a corrupt and faith ſo court to be kept to its engagements? Another parliament, nay, even the preſent may hereafter repeat the obligation, on the pretence of its being violently obtained, or unwiſely granted; and in that caſe, Where is our redreſs?—
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:043053_0034_101CB1C8B7B65C10"/>
No going to law with nations; cannon are the barri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of crowns; and the ſword, not of juſtice, but of war, decides the ſuit. To be on the footing of ſixty-three, it is not ſufficient, that the laws only be put on the ſame ſtate, but that our circumſtances, likewiſe be put on the ſame ſtate; our burnt and deſtroyed towns repaired or built up, our private loſſes made good, our public debts (contracted for defence) diſcharged, otherwiſe, we ſhall be millions worſe, than we were at that enviable period. Such a requeſt, had it been complied with a year ago, would have won the heart and ſoul of the Continent, but now it is too late. "The Rubicon is paſſed."</p>
            <p>Beſides the taking up arms, merely to enforce the repeal of a pecuniary law, ſeems as unwarrantable by the divine law, and as repugnant to human feelings, as the taking up arms to enforce the obedience there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to. The object, on either ſide, doth not juſtify the means; for the lives of men are too valuable, to be caſt away on ſuch trifles. It is the violence which is done and threatened to our perſons; the deſtruction of our property by an armed force; the invaſion of our country by fire and ſword, which conſcientiouſly qualifies the uſe of arms: And the inſtant, in which ſuch a mode of defence became neceſſary, all ſubjection to Britain ought to have ceaſed; and the independan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy of America, ſhould have been conſidered, as dating its aera from, and publiſhed by, <hi>the firſt musket that was fired againſt her.</hi> This line is a line of conſiſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; neither drawn by caprice, nor extended by am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition; but produced by a chain of events, of which the colonies were not the authors.</p>
            <p>I ſhall conclude theſe remarks, with the following timely and well intended hints. We ought to reflect, that there are three different ways, by which an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendancy may hereafter be affected; and that <hi>one</hi> of
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:043053_0035_101CB1CA6A4899A8"/>
thoſe <hi>three,</hi> will one day or other, be the fate of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, viz. By the legal voice of the people in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs; by a military power; or by a mob: It may not always happen that our ſoldiers are citizens, and the multitude a body of reaſonable men; vertue, as I have already remarked, is not hereditary, neither is it perpetual. Should an independancy be brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout by the firſt of thoſe means, we have every op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity and every encouragement before us, to form the nobleſt pureſt conſtitution on the face of the earth. We have it in our power to begin the world over again. A ſituation, ſimilar to the preſent, hath not happened ſince the days of Noah until now. The birth day of a new world is at hand, and a race of men, perhaps as numerous as all Europe contains, are to receive their portion of freedom from the event of a few months. The reflection is awful and in this point of view, how trifling, how ridiculous, do the little, paltry cavillings, of a few weak or intereſted men appear, when weighed againſt the buſineſs of a world.</p>
            <p>Should we neglect the preſent favorable and invit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing period, and an independance be hereafter effected by other means, we muſt charge the conſequence to ourſelves, or to thoſe rather, whoſe narrow and preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced ſouls, are habitually oppoſing the meaſure, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out either inquiring or reflecting. There are reaſons to be given in ſupport of independance, which men ſhould rather privately think of, than be publickly told of. We ought not now to be debating whether we ſhall be independant or not, but, anxious to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh it on a farm, ſecure, and honorable baſis, and uncaſtly rather that it is not yet began upon. Every day convinces us of its neceſſity. Even the To<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> (if ſuch beings yet remain among us) ſhould, of all men, be the moſt ſolicitous to promote it; for as the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:043053_0036_101CB1CDF8C5C0A0"/>
appointment of committees at firſt, protected them from popular rage, ſo, a wiſe and well eſtabliſhed form of government, will be the only certain means of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuing it ſecurely to them. <hi>Wherefore,</hi> if they have not virtue enough to be WHIGS, they ought to have prudence enough to wiſh for Independance.</p>
            <p>In ſhort, Independance is the only BOND that can tye and keep us together. We ſhall then ſee our ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and our ears will be legally ſhut againſt the ſchemes of an intriguing, as well, as a cruel enemy. We ſhall then too, be on a proper footing, to treat with Britain; for there is reaſon to conclude, that the pride of that court, will be leſs hurt by treating with the American ſtates for terms of peace, than with thoſe, whom ſhe denominates, "rebellious ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects," for terms of accommodation. It is our delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it that encourages her to hope for conqueſt, and our backwardneſs tends only to prolong the war. As we have, without any good effect therefrom, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held our trade to obtain a redreſs of our grievances, let us now try the alternative, by <hi>independantly</hi> redreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing them ourſelves, and then offering to open the trade. The mercantile and reaſonable part in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, will be ſtill with us; becauſe, peace with trade, is preferable to war without it. And if this offer be not accepted, other courts may be applied to.</p>
            <p>On theſe grounds I reſt the matter. And as no offer hath yet been made to refute the doctrine contained in the former editions of this pamphlet, it is a negative proof, that either the doctrine cannot be refuted, or, that the party in favour of it are too numerous to be oppoſed. <hi>Wherefore</hi> inſtead of gazing at each other with ſuſpicious or doubtful curioſity, let each of us hold out to his neighbour the hearty hand of friendſhip, and unite in drawing a line, which, like an act of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion ſhall bury in forgetfulneſs every former diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

            <p>THE Writer of this, is one of thoſe few, who ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſhonors religion either by ridiculing, or cavilling at any denomination whatſoever. To God, and not to man, are all men accountable on the ſcore of religion. Wherefore, this epiſtle is not ſo proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly addreſſed to you as a religious, but as a political bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, dabbling in matters, which the profeſſed Quietude of your Principles inſtruct you not to meddle with.</p>
            <p>As you have, without a proper authority for ſo do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, put yourſelves in the place of the whole body of the Quakers, ſo, the writer of this, in order to be on an equal rank with yourſelves, is under the neceſſity, of putting himſelf in the place of all thoſe, who, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the very writings and principles, againſt which, your teſtimony is directed: And he hath choſen this ſingular ſituation, in order, that you might diſcover in him that preſumption of character which you can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſee in yourſelves. For neither he nor you can have any claim or title to <hi>Political Repreſentation.</hi>

When men have departed from the right way, it is no wonder that they ſtumble and fall. And it is evident from the manner in which ye have managed your teſtimony, that politics, (as a religious body of men) is not your proper Walk; for however well a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted it might appear to you, it is, nevertheleſs, a a jumble of good and bad put unwiſely together, and the concluſion drawn therefrom, both unnatural and unjuſt.</p>
            <p>The two firſt pages, (and the whole doth not make four) we give you credit for, and expect the ſame ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vility from you, becauſe the love and deſire of peace is not confined to Quakeriſm, it is the natural, as well as, the religious wiſh of all denominations of men. And on this ground, as men laboring to eſtabliſh an Independant Conſtitution of our own, do we exceed all others in our hope, end, and aim. <hi>Our plan is peace forever.</hi> We are tired of contention with Britain, and can ſee no real end to it but in a final ſeparation. We act conſiſtently, becauſe for the ſake of introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing an endleſs and uninterupted peace, do we bear the evils and burthens of the preſent day. We are endeavoring, and will ſteadily continue to endeavour, to ſeperate and diſſolve a connection which hath al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready filled our land with blood; and which, while the name of it remains, will be the fatal cauſe of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture miſchiefs to both countries.</p>
            <p>We ſight neither for revenge nor conqueſt; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from pride nor paſſion; we are not inſulting the world with our fleets and armies, nor ravaging the globe for plunder. Beneath the ſhade of our own vines are we attacked; in our own houſes, and on our own lands, is the violence committed againſt us. We view our enemies in the character of Highway<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men and Houſe-breakers, and having no defence for ourſelves in the civil law, are obliged to puniſh them

by the military one, and apply the ſword, in the very caſe, where you have before now applied the halter—Perhaps we feel for the ruined and inſulted ſufferers in all and every part of the Continent, with a degree of tenderneſs which hath not yet made its way into ſome of your boſoms. But be ye ſure that ye miſtake not the cauſe and ground of your teſtimony. Call not coldneſs of ſoul, religion; nor put the Bigot in the place of the Chriſtian.</p>
            <p>O ye partial miniſters of your own acknowledged principles. If the bearing arms be ſinful, the firſt going to war muſt be more ſo, by all the difference between wilful attack and unavoidable defence. Wherefore, if ye really preach from conſcience, and mean not to make a political hobby-horſe of your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, convince the world thereof by proclaiming your doctrine to our enemies, <hi>for they likewiſe bear arm.</hi> Give us proof of your ſincerity by publiſhing it at St. James's, to the Commanders in chief at Boſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton, to the Admirals and Captains who are piratically ravaging our coaſts, and to all the murdering miſcre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants who are acting in authority under <hi>Him</hi> whom ye profeſs to ſerve.

            <p>Alas! it ſeems by the particular tendency of ſome part of your teſtimony, and other parts of your con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, as if, all ſin was reduced to, and comprehended in, <hi>the act of bearing arms,</hi> and that by the <hi>people only.</hi> Ye appear to us to have miſtaken party for conſcience; becauſe the general tenor of your actions wants uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity: And it is exceedingly difficult to us to give credit to many of your pretended ſcruples; becauſe, we ſee them made by the ſame men, who, in the very inſtant that they are exclaiming againſt the mammon of this world, are nevertheleſs hunting after it with a ſtep as ſteady as Time, and an appetite as keen as Death.</p>
            <p>The quotation which ye have made from Proverbs, in the third page of your teſtimony, that, <q>when a man's ways pleaſe the Lord, he maketh even his enemies to be at peace with him;</q> is very unwiſely choſen on your part; becauſe, it amounts to a proof, that the king's ways (whom ye are ſo deſirous of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting) do <hi>not</hi> pleaſe the Lord, otherwiſe, his reign would be in peace.</p>
            <p>I now proceed to the latter part of your teſtimony and that, for which all the foregoing ſeems only an introduction, viz.</p>
            <p>"It hath ever been our judgment and principle, ſince we were called to profeſs the light of Chriſt Jeſus, manifeſted in our conſciences unto this day, that the ſetting up and putting down kings and go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:043053_0041_101CB1E013DCCEF0"/>
is God's peculiar prerogative; for cauſes beſt known to himſelf: And that it is not our buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to have any hand or contrivance therein; nor to be buſy-bodies above our ſtation, much leſs to plot and contrive the ruin or overturn of any of them, but to pray for the king, and ſafety of our nation, and good of all men: That we may live a peaceable and quiet life, in all godlineſs and honeſty; <hi>under the goverment which God is pleaſed to ſet over us"</hi>—If theſe are really your principles why do you not abide by them? Why do you not leave that, which ye call God's Work, to be managed by himſelf? Theſe very principles inſtruct you to wait with patience and hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mility, for the event of all public meaſures, and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive that event as the divine will towards you. <hi>Wherefore,</hi> what occaſion is there for your <hi>political teſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timony</hi> if you fully believe what it contains? And the very publiſhing it proves, that either, ye do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve what ye profeſs, or have not virtue enough to practice what ye believe.</p>
            <p>The principles of Quakeriſm have a direct tendency to make a man the quiet and inoffenſive ſubject of any, and every government which is ſet over him And if the ſetting up and putting down of kings and governments is God's peculiar prerogative, he moſt certainly will not be robbed thereof by us; where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the principle itſelf leads you to approve of every thing, which ever happened, or may happen to kings as beings his work. Oliver Cromwell thanks you. Charles, then, died not by the hands of man; and ſhould the preſent proud Imitator of him, come to the ſame untimely end, the writers and publiſhers of the teſtimony, are bound by the doctrine it contains, to applaud the fact. Kings are not taken away by miracles, neither are changes in governments brought about by any other means than ſuch as are common
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:043053_0042_101CB1E374ECFEF8"/>
and human; and ſuch as we are now uſing. Even the diſperſion of the Jews, though foretold by our Saviour, was effected by arms. Wherefore, as ye re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe to be the means on one ſide, ye ought not to be meddlers on the other; but to wait the iſſue in ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence? and unleſs ye can produce divine authority, to prove, that the Almighty who hath created and placed this new world at the greateſt diſtance it could poſſibly ſtand, eaſt and weſt, from every part of the old, doth, nevertheleſs, diſapprove of its being inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant of the corrupt and abandoned court of Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, unleſs I ſay, ye can ſhew this, how can ye on the ground of your principles, juſtify the exciting and ſtirring up the people <q>firmly to unite in the <hi>ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horrence</hi> of all ſuch <hi>writings,</hi> and <hi>meaſures,</hi> as evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence a deſire and deſign to break off the <hi>happy</hi> connexion we have hitherto enjoyed, with the kingdom of Great-Britain, and our juſt and neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary ſubordination to the king, and thoſe who are lawfully placed in authority under him.</q> What a ſlap of the face is here! The men, who in the very paragragh before, have quietly and paſſively reſigned up the ordering, altering, and diſpoſal of kings and governments, into the hands of God, are now recal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling their principles, and putting in for a ſhare of the buſineſs. Is it poſſible, that the concluſion, which is here juſtly quoted, can any ways follow from the doctrine laid down? The inconſiſtency is too glaring not to be ſeen; the abſurdity too great not to be laughed at; and ſuch as could only have been made by thoſe, whole underſtandings were darkened by the narrow and crabbed ſpirit of a deſpairing politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal party; for ye are not to be conſidered as the whole body of the Quakers, but only as a factional and fractional part thereof.</p>

               <pb n="43" facs="unknown:043053_0043_101CB1E6AA6EEA40"/>
Here ends the examination of your teſtimony; (which, I call upon no man to abhor, as ye have done, but only to read and judge of fairly;) to which I ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>join the following remark; <q>That the ſetting up and putting down of kings,</q> moſt certainly mean, the making him a king, who is yet not ſo, and the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king him no king who is already one. And pray what hath this to do in the preſent caſe? We neither mean to <hi>ſet up</hi> nor to <hi>pull down,</hi> neither to <hi>make</hi> nor to <hi>unmake,</hi> but to have nothing to <hi>do</hi> with them. Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, your teſtimony in whatever light it is viewed ſerves only to diſhonor your judgment, and for many other reaſons had better have been let alone than publiſhed.</p>
            <p>Firſt, Becauſe it tends to the decreaſe and reproach of all religion whatever, and is of the utmoſt danger to ſociety, to make it a party in political diſputes.</p>
            <p>Secondly, Becauſe it exhibits a body of men, num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of whom diſavow the publiſhing political teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies, as being concerned therein and approvers thereof.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, Becauſe it hath a tendency to undo that Continental harmony and friendſhip which yourſelves by your late liberal and charatable donations hath lent a hand to eſtabliſh; and the preſervation of which, is of the utmoſt conſequence to us all.</p>
            <p>And here without anger or reſentment I bid you farewel. Sincerely wiſhing, that as men and chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, ye may always fully and uninterruptedly enjoy every civil and religious right; and be, in your turn, the means of ſecuring it to others; but that the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample which ye have unwiſely ſet, of mingling religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with politics, <hi>may be diſavowed and reprobated by e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very inhabitant of America.</hi>
