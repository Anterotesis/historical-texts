            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The Secretary of State, to whom was referred by the Houſe of Repreſentatives the letter of John H. Mitchell, reciting cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain propoſals, for ſupplying the United States with COPPER COINAGE, has had the ſame under conſideration, according to inſtructions, and begs leave to report thereon as follows.</head>
            <p>THE perſon who wiſhes to undertake the ſupply of a Copper Coinage, ſets forth, that the ſuperiority of his apparatus and proceſs for coining, enables him to furniſh a coinage, better and cheaper than can be done by any country or perſon whatever: that his dies are engraved by the firſt artiſt in that line in Europe: that his apparatus for ſtriking the edge, at the ſame blow with the faces, is new and ſingularly ingenious: that he coins by a preſs on a new principle, and worked by a fine engine more regularly than can be done by hand; that he will deliver any quantity of coin, of any ſize and device, of pure and unalloyed copper, wrapped in paper, and packed in caſks ready for ſhipping, for fourteen pence ſterling the pound.</p>
            <p>The Secretary of State has before been appriſed, from other ſources of information, of the great improvements made by this undertaker in ſundry arts: he is acquainted with the artiſt who invented the method of ſtriking the edge and both faces of the coin at one blow: he has ſeen his proceſs and coins, and ſent to the former Congreſs ſome ſpecimens of them, with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain offers from him before he entered into the ſervice of the preſent under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taker (which ſpecimens he takes the liberty of now ſubmitting to the inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Houſe, as proofs of the ſuperiority of this method of coinage in gold and ſilver, as well as copper).</p>
            <p>He is therefore of opinion, that the undertaker, aided by that artiſt, and by his own excellent machines, is truly in a condition to furniſh coin in a ſtate of higher perfection than has ever yet been iſſued by any nation: that perfection in the engraving is among the great ſafeguards againſt counterfeits, becauſe engravers of the firſt claſs are few, and elevated, by their rank in their art, far above the baſe and dangerous buſineſs of coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terfeiting. That the perfection of coins will indeed diſappear, after they are for ſome time worn among other pieces, and eſpecially where the figures are rather faintly relieved as on thoſe of this artiſt: yet their high finiſhing while new, is not the leſs a guard againſt counterfeits; becauſe theſe, if carried to any extent, muſt be uſhered into circulation new alſo, and conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently may be compared with genuine coins in the ſame ſtate: that there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, whenever the United States ſhall be diſpoſed to have a coin of their own, it will be deſirable to aim at this kind of perfection: that this cannot be better effected than by availing themſelves, if poſſible, of the ſervices of the undertaker and of this artiſt, whoſe excellent methods and machines are ſaid to have abridged, as well as perfected the operations of coinage. Theſe operations, however, and their expence being new and unknown here, he is unable to ſay whether the price propoſed be reaſonable or not.—He is alſo uncertain whether, inſtead of the larger copper coin, the legiſlature might not prefer a lighter one of billon, or mixed metal, as is practiſed with convenience by ſeveral other nations, a ſpecimen of which kind of coinage is ſubmitted to their inſpection.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:023001_0002_0FBAD240AE443148"/>But the propoſitions under conſideration, ſuppoſe that the work is to be carried on in a foreign country, and that the implements are to remain the property of the undertaker; which conditions, in his opinion render them inadmiſſible, for theſe reaſons—</p>
            <p>Coinage is peculiarly an attribute of ſovereignty; to transfer its exerciſe into another country, is to ſubmit it to another ſovereign.</p>
            <p>Its tranſportation acroſs the ocean, beſides the ordinary dangers of the ſea, would expoſe it to acts of piracy by the crews to whom it would be confided, as well as by others appriſed of its paſſage.</p>
            <p>In time of war it would offer to the enterprizes of an enemy, what have been emphatically called the ſinews of war.</p>
            <p>If the war were with the nation within whoſe territory the coinage is, the firſt act of war or repriſal might be to arreſt this operation, with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plements and materials, coined and uncoined, to be uſed at their diſcretion.</p>
            <p>The reputation and principles of the preſent undertaker, are ſafeguards againſt the abuſes of a coinage carried on in a foreign country, where no checks could be provided by the proper ſovereign, no regulations eſtabliſhed, no police, no guard exerciſed; in ſhort, none of the numerous cautions hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto thought eſſential at every mint; but in hands leſs entitled to confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, theſe will become dangers. We may be ſecured indeed, by proper experiments as to the purity of the coin delivered us according to contract, but we cannot be ſecured againſt that which, though leſs pure, ſhall be ſtruck in the genuine dye, and protected againſt the vigilance of government till it ſhall have entered into circulation.</p>
            <p>We loſe the opportunity of calling in and recoining the clipped money in circulation, or we double our riſks by a double tranſportation.</p>
            <p>We loſe in like manner the reſource of coining up our houſhold plate in the inſtant of great diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>We loſe the means of forming artiſts to continue the works, when the common accidents of mortality ſhall have deprived us of thoſe who began them.</p>
            <p>In fine, the carrying on a coinage in a foreign country, as far as the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretary knows, is without example; and general example is weighty au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority.</p>
            <p>He is therefore of opinion on the whole—That a mint, whenever eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed, ſhould be eſtabliſhed at home: that the ſuperiority, the merit, and means of the undertaker, will ſuggeſt him as the proper perſon to be engaged in the eſtabliſhment and conduct of a mint, on a ſcale, which, relinquiſhing nothing in the perfection of the coin, ſhall be duly proportioned to our pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes.</p>
            <p>And in the mean while he is of opinion, the preſent propoſals ſhould be declined.</p>
