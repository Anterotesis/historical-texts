            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

The Moſt Chriſtian King ſhall endeavour, by all the means in his power, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect and defend all veſſels and the effects belonging to the ſubjects, people or inhabitants of the ſaid U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States, or any of them, being in his ports, havens, roads, or on the ſeas near to his countries, iſlands, cities or towns; and to recover and reſtore to the right owners, their agents or attorneys, all ſuch veſſels and effects which ſhall be taken within his juriſdiction; and the ſhips of war of His Moſt Chriſtian Majeſty, or any convoy ſailing under his authority, ſhall, upon all occaſions, take under their protection, all veſſels belonging to the ſubjects, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:016145_0003_0F9B7E3A7B178488"/>
or inhabitants of the ſaid United States, or any of them, and holding the ſame courſe, or going the ſame way, and ſhall defend ſuch veſſels, as long as they hold the ſame courſe, or go the ſame way, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all attacks, force and violence, in the ſame manner as they ought to proteſt and defend the veſſels belonging to the ſubjects of the Moſt Chriſtian King.</p>
            <p>ARTICLE VII. In like manner the ſaid United States, and their ſhips of war, ſailing under their authority, ſhall protect and defend, conformably to the tenor of the preceding article, all the veſſels and effects belonging to the ſubjects of the Moſt Chriſtian King, and uſe all their endeavours to recover, and cauſe to be reſtored, the ſaid veſſels and effects that ſhall have been taken within the juriſdiction of the ſaid United States, or any of them.</p>
            <p>ARTICLE XIV. The merchant ſhips of either of the parties, which ſhall be making into a port be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to the enemy of the other ally, and concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing whoſe voyage and the ſpecies of goods on board her, there ſhall be juſt grounds of ſuſpicion, ſhall be obliged to exhibit, as well upon the high-ſeas as in the ports and havens, not only her paſſports, but likewiſe certificates, expreſsly ſhewing that her goods are not of the number of thoſe which have been prohibited as contraband.</p>
            <p>ARTICLE XV. If, by the exhibiting of the aboveſaid certificates, the other party diſcover there are any of thoſe ſorts of goods which are prohibited and declared contraband, and conſigned for a port under the obedience of his enemy, it ſhall not be
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:016145_0004_0F9B7E3C08C210C0"/>
lawful to break up the hatches of ſuch ſhip, or to open any cheſt, coffers, packs, caſks, or any other veſſels found therein, or to remove the ſmalleſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels of her goods, whether ſuch ſhip belongs to the ſubjects of France, or the inhabitants of the ſaid U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited States; unleſs the lading be brought on ſhore in the preſence of the officers of the Court of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, and an inventory thereof made, but there ſhall be no allowance to ſell, exchange, or alienate the ſame in any manner, until after that due and lawful proceſs ſhall have been had againſt ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited goods, and the Court of Admiralty ſhall, by a ſentence pronounced, have confiſcated the ſame; ſaving always, as well the ſhip itſelf, as any other goods found therein, which by this Treaty are to be eſteemed free; neither may they be detained on pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of their being as it were infected by the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited goods, much leſs ſhall they be confiſcated as lawful prize; but if not the whole cargo, but only part thereof, ſhall conſiſt of prohibited or contraband goods, and the commander of the ſhip ſhall be ready and willing to deliver them to the captor, who has diſcovered them, in ſuch caſe, the captor, having received thoſe goods, ſhall forthwith diſcharge the ſhip, and not hinder her by any means freely to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute the voyage on which ſhe was bound; but in caſe the contraband merchandize cannot be all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived on board the veſſel of the captor, then the captor may, notwithſtanding the offer of delivering him the contraband goods, carry the veſſel into the neareſt port, agreeable to what is above directed.</p>

            <p>ARTICLE XXV. It ſhall be lawful for all and ſingular the ſubjects of the Moſt Chriſtian King, and the citizens, people and inhabitants of the ſaid United States, to ſail with their ſhips with all man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of liberty and ſecurity, no diſtinction being made who are the proprietors of the merchandize laden thereon, from any port, to the places of thoſe who now are or hereafter ſhall be at enmity with the Moſt Chriſtian King or the United States.

            <p>ARTICLE XXVI. The liberty of navigation and commerce ſhall extend to all kinds of merchandizes, excepting thoſe only which are diſtinguiſhed by the name of contraband, and under this name of contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band or prohibited goods ſhall be comprehended arms, great guns, bombs with their fuſes, and other things belonging to them, cannon ball, gun powder, match, pikes, ſwords, lances, ſpears, halberts, mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tars, petards, grenadoes, ſalt petre, muſkets, muſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ket ball, bucklers, helmets, breaſt plates, coats of mail, and the like kinds of arms, proper for arming ſoldiers, muſket reſts, belts, horſes with their fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niture, and all other warlike inſtruments whatever. Theſe merchandizes which follow ſhall not be reckoned among contraband or prohibited goods, that is to ſay, all ſorts of cloths, and all other ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures woven of any wool, flax, ſilk, cotton, or any other materials whatever; all kinds of wearing apparel, together with the ſpecies whereof they are uſed to be made, gold and ſilver, as well coined as uncoined, tin, iron, latten, copper, braſs, coals, as alſo wheat and barley, and any other kind of corn and pulſe, tobacco, and likewiſe all manner of ſpices, ſalted and ſmoaked fleſh, ſalted fiſh, cheeſe and but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter,

            <p>ARTICLE XXVII. To the end that all manner of diſſentions and quarrels may be avoided and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented, on one ſide and the other, it is agreed, that in caſe either of the parties hereto ſhould be engaged in war, the ſhips and veſſels belonging to the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects or people of the other ally muſt be furniſhed with ſea letters or paſſports, expreſſing the name, property and bulk of the ſhip, as alſo the name and place of habitation of the maſter or commander of
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016145_0010_0F9B7E42480037C0"/>
the ſaid ſhip, that it may appear thereby that the ſhip really and truly belongs to the ſubjects of one of the parties; which paſſport ſhall be made out and granted according to the form annexed to this trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. They ſhall likewiſe be recalled every year, that is, if the ſhip happens to return home within the ſpace of a year; it is likewiſe agreed, that ſuch ſhips being laden, are to be provided not only with paſſports as above-mentioned, but alſo with certifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates, containing the ſeveral particulars of the car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>go, the place whence the ſhip ſailed, and whither ſhe is bound, that ſo it may be known whether any forbidden or contraband goods be on board of the ſame; which certificates ſhall be made out by the officers of the place whence the ſhip ſet ſail, in the accuſtomed forms; and if any one ſhall think it fit or adviſeable to expreſs in the ſaid certificates the perſon to whom the goods on board belong, he may freely do ſo.</p>
            <p>ARTICLE XXIX.
