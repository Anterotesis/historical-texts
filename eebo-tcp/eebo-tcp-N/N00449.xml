            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                     <hi>Ephraim</hi> compasseth me about with Lies, and the House of <hi>Israel</hi> with Deceit.</p>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THe Subject which I am at present to handle is the sin of Formality in Gods Worship, which is the sin con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned in the Text, as none of the least of those many and very great controversies, that the Lord hath had all along with his professing people, and at this day has par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly with our selves.</p>
            <p>Take a brief explication of the Terms.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ephraim</hi> was the Second Son of <hi>Joseph</hi> born in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and that name given him in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of Gods making him fruitful in the land of his <hi>affliction, Gen</hi> 41.52. unto him <hi>Jacob,</hi> in his Blessing, gave the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to his Elder Brother, <hi>Gen.</hi> 48.20. The name is sometimes used for the whole
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000571_0002_0FA7118134052380"/>
Tribe that lineally descended from him, and here for the Ten Tribes, of whom he was the Head or Chief, and is the same with.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>[The House of Israel.] Israel</hi> signifies a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailer with God, and was the new Name which God gave to <hi>Jacob</hi> in memory of his Victorious combate at <hi>Peniel, Gen.</hi> 32.28. And all his posterity, the whole visible Church, bare that Name of <hi>Israel,</hi> until after the separation of the Ten Tribes from the two, when the Name of <hi>Israel</hi> was frequently given to the <hi>Ten,</hi> and the Name of <hi>Juda</hi> unto the <hi>two,</hi> so that <hi>Ephra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>im</hi> and <hi>Israel</hi> in the Text are <hi>homonymous</hi> Terms, or intend the same people.</p>
            <p>[<hi>Compasseth me.</hi>] Compassing is some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times used for Worship, and in that sense it is to be taken here. Thus <hi>Psal.</hi> 26.6. <hi>Compassing Gods Altar,</hi> intends Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping of God, offering up Sacrifice on his Altar, which was one principal part of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship. In the same sense is the phrase used <hi>Psal.</hi> 7.7.</p>
            <p>Christ hath promised that where his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple <hi>meet together in his Name,</hi> (as all that are regularly Assembled for any part of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stituted Worship do) <hi>he will be in the midst of them, Mat.</hi> 18.20. and if he be in the midst of us, we are then compassing him about.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Hebrew</hi> word in the Text is also sometimes used for Beleaguering or Besieg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000571_0002_0FA7118134052380"/>
a Town or City in an hostile way, and truly God accounts such hypocritical wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship little better than waging War against himself, &amp; such <hi>Compassers</hi> he looks at as his Besiegers, and they will sooner or later be dealt with as such<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
            </p>
            <p>Some Expositors attribute it to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet, as if he were beset with their Lies and scandalous Reports, to the prejudice of his Ministry, which is one of Satans strata<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gems to prevent the Success of the Gospel, by reproaching them that dispense it. Thus they served <hi>Jeremiah,</hi> chap. 20.<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>0. &amp; 18.18. and thus they lay snares for him that reproves in the Gate, <hi>Isa.</hi> 29.21. When Gods Messengers are reproving sin, they may look for such Treats, (though I would beg of this Auditory, that they would<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> be more kind to us, and to themselves too, while we are according to our Commission, <hi>Isa.</hi> 58.1. shewing God's People their sin) It's a good note of one upon the place. <hi>A Faithful Minister is the Genter in which all the lives of Lies and Slan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders meet.</hi> An ill case, if they be silent God is displeased, if they speak men are angry.</p>
            <p>But I rather take it in the fore-going sense, as referring to God in his Worship.</p>
            <p>[<hi>With Lies and Deceit</hi>] These Terms also mean the same thing, unless you will say the latter is Exegetical, and shews what was their aim and design in lying, <hi>viz.</hi> to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:000571_0003_0FA71181EDDD4988"/>
God, they pretended to great devotion in keeping up the external form of Worship, without being sincere and real therein, and that was their lying, whereby they thought (tho' it was wretched Atheism so to think) to put God off, to deceive and put a cheat upon him, as if the Omniscient God could be imposed upon.</p>
            <p>But this will be more fully opened in Explaining the Doctrine.</p>
            <p>DOCTRINE.</p>
            <p>Formality in God's Worship is accounted by him as Lying and Deceiving, and so is a very provoking sin. Formal Worshippers are lookt at by God as lyars and deceivers, and thereby exposed to his sorest anger.</p>
            <p>There are three sorts of False and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceitful Worship, which God is Displeased with.</p>
            <p n="1">1. When men Worship any other Person or thing than the one onely, living and true God, when they have and serve any other God before or besides the True God; and this is gross Idolatry and a breach of the first Commandment.</p>
            <p n="2">2. When they Worship the true God but with False Worship, such as never <hi>came</hi> into his mind, but is the meer product of their own Invention, which yet they ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:000571_0003_0FA71181EDDD4988"/>
in stead of, or mix or joyn with his Institutions. This is a Breach of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Commandment, and very offensive to a Jealous God.</p>
            <p n="3">3. When the object of the Worship is right, and the Worship it self is for the matter, or as to the externals thereof true, but the miscarriage of it lies in the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of doing it, in that it is done with a Dissembling Heart, or in a cold formal manner. And this sin is forbidden in the third Commandment, which directs about the right manner of performing true Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship (both natural and Instituted) to the true God.</p>
            <p>The two latter may be intended here, and chiefly the third, or a mixture of them both (for the Heart cannot be right where the Worship is wrong) yea in a sense all three of them; For they had the Calves at <hi>Dan</hi> and <hi>Bethel,</hi> at best a false Medium, nor could they any more excuse themselves from the missing it in the object of worship too, than their Fathers, who tho' they proclaimed a Feast to <hi>Jehovah</hi> before the Golden Calf, yet might be said to have chosen new Gods (as <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.8.) and to Sacrifice to Devils and not to God, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.17 And be sure all this while their Heart was not right with God.</p>
            <p>But I shall confine my Discourse unto such as are Professors of the true God,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:000571_0004_0FA71182C1956D10"/>
who have also the right-way of Instituted Worship, but through the falseness of their hearts do but lye to him in all they per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form; a sin commonly practised in our Days by Professors of Religion.</p>
            <p>Q. <hi>What is this Formal Worship, which is called Lying and Deceit?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>A.</hi> It's worth our inquiring into, because called by very hard names, very much com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained of in Scripture, and there is abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of it among Gods visible people, yea too much among those that may have the Root of the matter in them, and also be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause it's very provoking to God, and mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chievous to them that use it.</p>
            <p>Now I call that Formal Worship, which is opposed to that which is in reality. <hi>Paul</hi> opposes a <hi>Form of Godliness to the power of it,</hi> 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.5. Such Pretenders make Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rilous Times. He intends such Persons as used an appearance without any reality, a shew without any substance. They made a profession of Godliness, and used much Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tensive Devotion in Worship, but there was nothing in it, save an appearance and shadow only, <hi>Vox preterea nihil,</hi> an empty Form, no powerful sincerity in their heart, nor good fruit in their life. And this Vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard men put on to deceive, that they may walk <hi>incognito</hi> in the World.</p>
            <p>Formal Worship is Hypocritical Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, like a painted Tomb without, but
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:000571_0004_0FA71182C1956D10"/>
Corruption &amp; Rottenness within, Fire with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out and Frost within, A flame in the mouth but Ice in the Heart: A perfect piece of Pageantry, a Play, where he that is in shew a <hi>King,</hi> is in Reallity a <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Such <hi>lying</hi> Worship is thus Described by Christ Mat. 15:8, 9. <hi>Drawing near to God with the Lips,</hi> when the Heart is far from him, near in look and gestures, but far in heart and spirit, this is the spirit of an Hypocrite. When out of any low, base, inferiour end, men are drawn or driven to those duties which indeed they have no Heart to, this the Lord ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts lying in his Worship. And the more external Preparations, the more Cost and Grandeur there is in it, the bigger the lye.</p>
            <p>Christ reduceth all our Obedience, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in point of Worship or otherwise, unto that one word <hi>Love,</hi> now if not <hi>lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> Worship, its <hi>lying</hi> Worship; there is an Idol in the Heart, which has their Love, while God has their Lips only, they pretend Devotion to God, but the Idol in the Heart has the Heart all the while.</p>
            <p>When the Heart and Body do not go together in the Service of God, the Body shews much love, but the Heart is otherwise imployed. Ezek. 33:31.</p>
            <p>This <hi>lying</hi> worship is opposed to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shipping
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:000571_0005_0FA71185167B6EA0"/>

            <p>For a further discovery of this sin of <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Deceit</hi> in Gods Worship, let us take notice of some of the <hi>Deceits</hi> used in Prayer, Hearing, Receiving the Sacrament, and Sanctifying the Sabbath; and our par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularizing here, will offer much matter of Conviction as we go along.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Of Compassing God about with <hi>Lies</hi> and <hi>Deceit</hi> in Prayer.</p>
            <p>Prayer is no small part of Instituted Worship, and to be made use of with eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry part of Worship. And doubtless Gods own Children have need to pray with <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid, That God would remove from them the way of</hi> Lying even when they are Praying, <hi>Psal.</hi> 119.29.</p>
            <p>In solitary prayer when they enter into their Closets and shut their doors, they are more happy than the most and best of Christians always are if they can shut out all vain and impertinent thoughts from coming in. All such (and much more wicked, blasphemous and unbelieving) thoughts are <hi>faults,</hi> and if allowed are <hi>lies</hi>; though they are not wickednesses, they are infirmities, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>nd if not watcht against and mourned over, will be charged on us as <hi>Lies</hi> and <hi>Deceit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In our ordinary social prayers, how hard
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:000571_0007_0FA7118A43D36690"/>
to keep our heart engaged in every word of Petition, Confession or Thanksgiving uttered by him that is our mouth unto God! vagaries are a sort of <hi>Lies,</hi> and wandering or diverting is <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In extraordinary Prayers on Fasting and Humiliation Days there is a great deal of <hi>deceit</hi> used. Especially when men fast for <hi>strife and debate, Isa.</hi> 58.<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> like a <hi>Bullrush,</hi> (though many arrive not to that, and so their <hi>lying</hi> is the more open and obvious, and their sin goes before-hand unto Judgment.) But they have no Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nce of a broken heart and contrite spirit to present the Lord withal. What is this but <hi>dissembling</hi> and <hi>lying,</hi> while they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend performance of the Duties of such a Solemnity, and yet neglect the principal thing required? If there be not (on such days especially) in their Addresses to God, hearty confessions of sin, deep Humiliation under it, and Soul affliction for it, with serious resolution to turn from it; all that is done without this, is nothing but <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>deceiving,</hi> and the greater the expence in the external part of the duty, the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er the <hi>deceit</hi> if not rightly performed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:000571_0008_0FA7118AF86729C8"/>To instance in the several parts of pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er.</p>
            <p n="1">1. There is Confession, and that either of Gods Glory, or our sin and vileness.</p>
            <p>If we make Confession of Gods Glory and Majesty, and yet do not really and practically believe what we say; We call him Father, but do not honour him; Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ster, but do not fear him; Lord, but do not obey him; or Shepherd; but do not hear <hi>his voice and follow him</hi>; what do we less than <hi>mock</hi> and <hi>lye</hi> to him?</p>
            <p>We confess his Omniscience, but carry toward him in our hearts, as if he were far out of our sight, that though he plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ear, and formed the eye, could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hear nor see, <hi>but was like the deaf and blind Idol, Psal.</hi> 115. come with our hands full of sin, as if we thought he could not discern whether we did lift up <hi>holy hands</hi> or no. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 2.8.</p>
            <p>We acknowledge his <hi>Power</hi> in words, but doubt of his Ability to save us, and engage not our hearts to <hi>take hold of his Strength and be at peace with him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We confess his <hi>Wisdom,</hi> and yet will instruct and limit the <hi>Holy One</hi> of <hi>Israel,</hi> and be our own carvers in point of the things we would have granted us.</p>
            <p>We call him our <hi>Soveraign,</hi> but must have our own wills, and while we say, <hi>Thy Will be done,</hi> are very impatient if ours
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:000571_0008_0FA7118AF86729C8"/>
he not complied with.</p>
            <p>We verbally own his <hi>Goodness,</hi> but we <hi>lye</hi> in our hearts if we do not close with him as Goodness it self, and make him the object of our highest love accordingly.</p>
            <p>We own his <hi>Mercy,</hi> but do not <hi>confide</hi> and <hi>hope</hi> in it: Confess him to be <hi>Just,</hi> and yet pass not <hi>the time of our sojourning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> before him in fear.</hi> We say it's a <hi>fearful thing to fall into his hands,</hi> and yet by such kind of trifling in his Worship do most directly deliver our selves up into the Hands of his Jealousie and Justice.</p>
            <p>We profess our love to him, but while our heart is not with him, we <hi>mock</hi> him and <hi>lye</hi> to him, as she told <hi>Sampson, Judg.</hi> 16.15.</p>
            <p>Thus while we confess all Gods Glorious Attributes in prayer, but do not make him the object of our Faith, Love, Fear, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> we do not <hi>lye</hi> to him.</p>
            <p>Thus also in Confession of our own Sin and Vileness.</p>
            <p>We often confess sin, but do not believe that we are such Sinners indeed as we say we are, nor are sensible what an evil and bitter thing sin is. We call our selves Sinners in the general, but when we come to particulars, are ready to extenuate and excuse if not to deny it.</p>
            <p>Again, if we confess the sin that we have no mind to part with, and acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000571_0009_0FA7118BB0D747D8"/>
those Iniquities that we keep in our bosoms with complacence and delight, what is this but deceitful dealing with God? We seem very pathetically in words to confess our own wretchedness and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthiness, but God and our own Consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences know that we do but <hi>lye</hi> unto him, <hi>while not humbled to this day, Jer.</hi> 44.10. and are better opinionated of our selves than wee pretend to in our Confessions.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>A second part of Prayer is Petition.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And <hi>there</hi> is also a great deal of <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>deceit.</hi> As for Instance.</p>
            <p>When we ask outward things to spend them upon our Lusts &amp; not that we may sincerely use them for the Glory of God; this <hi>is asking amiss,</hi> Jam. 4.3. This is <hi>deceitful Praying,</hi> to ask his mercies that we may fight against him with his own weapons; what is it but <hi>Couzenage</hi> and <hi>Deceit</hi>? So when we ask Gifts only to make a fine shew among men, and get a Reputation for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion; which is finally to sacrifice Gods Gifts to our ambition and vain-glory.</p>
            <p>Or when we ask spiritual Blessings which we are not really concerned to receive.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Austin has such a passage in his Confessions, that he often asked that of God in Prayer, which he was in his heart afraid lest he should give.</hi> Many seem to beg hard for Grace, when God knows, they do not desire it; ask Knowledge, when they hate the Light,
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:000571_0009_0FA7118BB0D747D8"/>
and cannot endure to come to it; ask to have sin personed, when they cannot part with it, purged, while they hold fast their <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>,</hi> and refuse to let it go, this is down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right <hi>lying before God,</hi> Jer. 8.5. Thus we pray for the Sanctifying of his Name, Coming of his Kingdom, doing of his Will, but in heart we are for neither of them.</p>
            <p>Of such kind of addressing God in a Time of Affliction, the Lord pronounces that it is but <hi>flattering</hi> and <hi>lying,</hi> and that because the <hi>Heart is not right with God,</hi> Psa. 78.34—37.</p>
            <p>And so of our Thanksgiving, which is also a part of <hi>Prayer,</hi> when we say in words, <hi>Lord, we bless and praise thy Name,</hi> but our hearts are not fixed to that work, nor do we take due care to order our whole Conversa<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ion so as may be most for his Service and Glory. Verbal praising of God, with practical dishonouring of him is plain <hi>lying.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So when we promise to him what we never intend to perform, at least never du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly care to perform; they that make so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn vows in the days of their distress, but forget to pay them in the days of their enlargement, are but <hi>lyars</hi> and <hi>deceivers.</hi>

            <p n="2">2. <hi>Of the</hi> Lying <hi>and</hi> Deceit <hi>in Hearing the Word.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Hear,</hi> but come with an idol in their heart, hear and go forth immediately, and all they hear is lost, the Word choakt, and so their labour proves in vain.</p>
            <p>To hear without an unfeigned Resolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to no as well as hear, together with a sincere endeavour to perform what they resolve, is <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>deceitful</hi> Hearing.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>At a Sacrament men lye to God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When they do not discern the Lords Body, do not make it their business to see and converse with a Crucified Christ that is there held forth.</p>

            <p>When at the beholding of a Crucified Christ, there is no mourning over him, nor for their sins that Crucified him, no activi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Faith, though the Lord Jesus be evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently set forth as Crucified, for the draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forth of their Faith on him; no infla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming of their Love, by the dying Love of a dear Saviour, which they are then called to a fixed meditation on; the failure here speaks the neglect of what is the principal end of a Sacrament, and therefore is no less than <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>deceit</hi> in Gods account, however the external Deportment may appear fair and commendable before men, that can only judge by the seeing of the eye, and hearing of the ear.</p>
            <p n="4">4 <hi>So we may say of the Sabbath.</hi>

               <p>First, I shall draw some Inferences from the Doctrine.</p>
               <p n="1">1. If there be such a thing as <hi>Lying</hi> and <hi>Deceitful Dealing</hi> in Gods Wors<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

It's a very lying Age that we live in. Men lye one to another, in falsifying their words, breaking their promises, yea, and
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:000571_0011_0FA7118D372251A0"/>
more solemn Obligations. Men lye one of another by scandalous Reports which they raise and broach, very much to the detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their Neighbours, and reproach of Religion. Yea, there are that make it no small part of their business to invent &amp; frame <hi>Lies,</hi> and scatter them abroad to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muse the World withal, and to draw forth mens sentiments, <hi>on</hi> which they make their Remarks, and <hi>of</hi> which they make matter of Accusation. There is also much De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiving and Over-reaching one another in Dealing, the weakest (though the honest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est) goes to the wall; I say there is much of this among men. Think it not strange, while there is so much dissembling with God himself, you may look to meet with the like among men. And it arises from the same principle, the <hi>Atheism</hi> that is in all Mankind, that which makes them dare to <hi>lie</hi> to God, will not let them stick at <hi>lying</hi> to men. Look for nothing but fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shood and mischief from him that makes no Conscience of essaying to put his cheats upon the Great God. He that will adven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to <hi>lye</hi> to God directly, will not stick more remotely to <hi>lye</hi> to him, as all <hi>lying</hi> to men is, all sin being finally against God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. See what little cause we have to boast of any merit in any of our Services; where there is so much deceit, there can be no Merit.</p>

                  <hi>Outward</hi> Performances if they be only <hi>such,</hi> are meer <hi>lies,</hi> and therefore rather provocations unto God, than obligations upon him. Hence when they trusted to the Temple of the Lord, and to their Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices and Sacrifices there, the Lord tells them <hi>they trusted in lying words,</hi> Jer. 7.4. 8</p>
               <p>But suppose they be sincere performan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, worship done in spirit and truth, there will be no room for trusting in or boasting of them; for the sincerity of the heart is Grace, &amp; that Grace tho inherent, yet is in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fused Grace, &amp; the exercise of that sincerity in Worship is exciting Grace, &amp; <hi>all Grace</hi> takes away all occasion of boasting.</p>
               <p>There are some actings of pride in the best, to their shame and confusion of face, when they reflect thereupon: but usually, or mostly they are false in their Worship that trust to it, and of them it may be said, <hi>they trust to a Refuge of Lies, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der falshood do they hide themselves,</hi> Isa 28.25. Because all their Worship is so. Were our Services never so good, yet if trusted in when we have done them, we make a <hi>lye,</hi> an Idol of them, and shall find them to be a <hi>lye</hi> to us; much more when there is so much <hi>

               <p>Here is a great deal of worship, and many Worshippers.

And yet it is a sin condemned by the light of nature, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned by the verdict of every mans Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science that is not blinded or bribed, asleep or seared.

The great God is the sole Object of Worship.

               <p n="2">2. Be well acquainted with the Person whom we Worship, and that will oblige us what we may to study a proportion be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween our Worship, and the Object of our Worship.</p>

               <p>Consider him as the first Being, &amp; chief<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est Good, &amp; thence learn, that the first &amp; best of our <hi>Hearts, Abilities, Time, Spirits, Souls,</hi> are his due, and that <hi>lame, blind, heartless, useless Services</hi> are very much un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>becoming him.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Soveraignty</hi> as it commands Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, so it will guard us from snuffing at his Service, or slubbering over his Worship.</p>

               <p>His <hi>Omniscience</hi> will assure us that he will not be <hi>shamm'd</hi> nor imposed upon, there's no <hi>mocking</hi> him with shadows or pretences; he is not to be treated after that manner. He will say to every Hypocrite, tho' under the greatest disguise, why seignest thou thy self to be another person, I have heavy Tidings for thee; and a Curse upon the <hi>Deceiver</hi> is heavy Tidings</p>
               <p>His <hi>Omnipotence</hi> will represent him as a person that has in a readiness wherewith

to avenge all Affronts, and to assist all the Humble Souls that desire to serve him bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Holiness</hi> tells us that we must lift up <hi>holy hands</hi> and <hi>hearts</hi> before him, and purge our selves in order to our being <hi>Vessels fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for our Masters use.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>Justice</hi> will caution us from taking his <hi>Name in vain,</hi> because he will not <hi>hold us Guiltless</hi>; and when we take up his Worship without spirit, heart, life, care, labour, seriousness, we take his <hi>Name in vain.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>His <hi>Bounty</hi> and <hi>Goodness</hi> will quicken us to serve him with <hi>Enlargedness</hi> of Heart, who hath such a <hi>liberal</hi> hand to <hi>reward</hi> all his Servants.</p>
               <p>His <hi>Truth</hi> and <hi>Faithfulness</hi> as they will put us beyond dispute about the certainty of the <hi>Reward,</hi> if we serve him <hi>well,</hi> so of the <hi>Punishment,</hi> if <hi>trifling</hi> and <hi>slightly</hi> therein.</p>
               <p>Thus right Conceptions of God will no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tably influence you into right Worship, &amp; a due performance of it.</p>
               <p n="3">3. Study well the <hi>right</hi> way in which God will be Worshipped, and his <hi>own</hi> way is the only <hi>right</hi> way. He hath plainly told us in his Word, <hi>how</hi> he will be Worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped; if we bring him any other Worship than that of his own prescribing, he will call it <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>deceit.</hi> Beware therefore

that none spoil you through vain <hi>deceit</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the <hi>Traditions</hi> of <hi>men,</hi> Col. 2.8. A very good caution, for <hi>Traditions of men</hi> in the Worship of God, will spoil our Worship, and spoil us also, aand are <hi>rightly</hi> called <hi>deceitful</hi> and <hi>vain,</hi> because they take us off from the only true, acceptable and profi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Service of God. Resolve upon it, either Bible-Worship or none at all, all other being <hi>as,</hi> yea <hi>worse than</hi> none. It's <hi>lying</hi> worship if not warranted by God's Word, whatever <hi>pretences</hi> it may make to <hi>Decency</hi> in it self, or <hi>Authority</hi> from men, Traditions from our Fore-fathers, or the Commands of the Church, God will say of it, <hi>Bring no more vain oblations, &amp; who has re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired these things at your hands</hi>? Nor will God take it as an answer if we say that <hi>Ecclesiastical Authority</hi> enjoyned it, unless it agree with the <hi>Pattern</hi> in the <hi>Mount,</hi> and be prescribed by the <hi>Lord of the House.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. Let us offer up all our worship by Christ, God in Christ is the object of Divine Worship. To goe to God in our Prayers or other Services, immediately, to God out of or without Christ is to <hi>lye</hi> in our <hi>services.</hi> That General Rule of <hi>Doing all in the Name of the Lord Jesus Col.</hi> 2.17. holds most strictly in point of worship.

Otherwise what-ever of <hi>Labour, Care, Zeal, Cost,</hi> may be put into our <hi>Obla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> if there be nothing of <hi>Christ</hi> in them they signify nothing at all with God; they are Lame, Blind, Lean and Dead Sacrifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and will be most displeasing in Gods most Pure Eies, and the savour of them very offensive to his Nostrils if not perfum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Incense of his Merits which he is Offering up <hi>with the prayers of the Saints.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="5">5. See that our Hearts be in the wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship, fervently and frequently make that necessary Prayer, Ps. 119.80. <hi>Let my Heart be sound in thy Statutes,</hi> especially sound in <hi>thy</hi> Statutes and <hi>my</hi> performances about <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship,</hi> because God is eminently Jealous there. Daily make <hi>Davids</hi> prayer, <hi>That God will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from us the way of lying, Psal.</hi> 119.29. And that particularly when we draw near unto God in worship, that we may do it with a <hi>true Heart, Heb.</hi> 10.22. Ingage the Heart to go along with our Bodies and Tongues, when addressing the Heart-searching God, yea &amp; do not only carry our Hearts thither, but by an extraordinary care and watchfulness keep them there, that they may not give you the slip, and so render all your worship <hi>successless,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause <hi>heartless.</hi> Then only do you wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship God in Spirit and Truth when your Hearts are sincerely active in what you
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:000571_0021_0FA7110CF4803750"/>
do. Dare not <hi>offer</hi> unto God that which cost you nothing but a little Breath and Lip-labour, remember that your Heart gives value to your two Mites, the least piece of Hearty Service is in high esteem with God.</p>
               <p n="6">6. Finally let our constant Walk be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways consonant to our Worship, our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment agreeable to our Devotions, our whole Conversations such as become such Worshippers. A loose Conversation gives the <hi>lye</hi> to a specious profession. If what be said in words is contradicted in works, God will call it <hi>lying</hi> and <hi>deceit, Tit.</hi> 1.16. To be zealous and warm in our <hi>Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship</hi> but luke warm and carnal in our <hi>Walk</hi> is most absurd and Contradictory. Let us <hi>Live</hi> our <hi>Hearing, Praying, Sabbaths, Sacraments,</hi> &amp;c. and then we worship well, And if we do indeed worship well, our <hi>worship</hi> to God will observably Influence, all our <hi>converse</hi> with men. And Oh how amiable and pleasant is an Harmonious A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement there! And how unseemly the contrary! That men walk no better be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore and after worship, is an ill sign of their being <hi>insincere and false and deceitful in it.</hi>

               <p>To Conclude,</p>
               <p>Thus you have heard <hi>one</hi> more very common and provoking sin declaimed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst. And note that when the Lord gave the Prophet <hi>Isa.</hi> 58.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mission
