            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <bibl>ROMANS, CHAP. XIII. VERSE 4, firſt clauſe.</bibl>
               <q>For he is the Miniſter of <hi>GOD</hi> to thee for good.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>IT is the appropriate privilege of chriſtianity, to afford doctrines and precepts adapted to the circumſtances of all characters of men. Other ſyſtems of morality are partial in their inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, deficient in motives, and erroneous in the maxims of human life. But the author of our ſaith hath grounded our obligations upon a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional foundation, excited us to duty by ſuitable and efficient motives, and extended his inſtructions to every claſs of men. With equal regards he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects the wiſe and the noble, the uninſtructed and him of low degree. To render his ſyſtem the more beneficial, he has appointed miniſters to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain its principles, and inculcate his ſaving doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trines upon men of all degrees; to vindicate and magnify his inſtitutions before Kings, and to preach the goſpel to the poor.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:020469_0006_0FAF0CEE2C976F90"/>
AND this is the miniſter's happineſs, that he is ready furniſhed with inſtructions ſuited to every auditory before whom he may ſpeak. All men need inſtruction, to be prompted to the diſcharge of their ſupreme obligations to God, and their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative obligations to each other. And this is their common privilege, that the bleſſed Jeſus by his written word and preached goſpel, provides for all <hi>a portion in due ſeaſon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE words ſelected for the baſis of a diſcourſe upon the preſent occaſion, contain inſtruction for rulers; to point them to the origin of their power and the uſe they ſhould make of it: They com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize a leſſon equally uſeful to ſubjects; how to conduct themſelves in relation to their rulers, and what views to entertain of their authority.</p>
            <p>SHOULD the Preacher conform himſelf to the text, and place to view the ſolemn importance of it, the preſent occaſion might be richly profitable to this great aſſembly. May that Divine Teacher, <hi>who ſpake as never man ſpake,</hi> by the aids of his Spirit, aſſiſt the Preacher <hi>to find out acceptable words and the words of truth and ſoberneſs;</hi> to recommend his doctrines in their purity and power to his ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, now convened to learn the law in his ſanctuary.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:020469_0007_0FAF0CF091486C58"/>
               <hi>For he is the miniſter of God to thee for good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OUR firſt enquiry is, Who is this miniſter of God? The context informs us, that <hi>he is the civil magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate,</hi> called in a preceding paſſage, <hi>the higher powers,</hi> ſince the magiſtrate is raiſed in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity to a ſtation above his brethren, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſted with authority to govern others, by or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining and executing laws for the common good. That magiſtrates are deſignated by the Apoſtle, appears from his terming them, <hi>Rulers who are not a terror to good works, but to the evil;</hi> they are appointed to ſupport good morals and puniſh vice. And this part of the deſcription agrees with the civil magiſtrate, <hi>He is a revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil:</hi> And as an acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his ſervices and dignity, <hi>he receives tribute.</hi> It is thus evident from the Apoſtle's calling him <hi>the Higher Powers, the Ruler and the Revenger,</hi> that the <hi>civil magiſtrate</hi> is intended by <hi>the miniſter of God.</hi> In ſpeaking upon this ſubject, four general pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions will merit our attention, <abbr>viz.</abbr>
            </p>
            <list>
               <item>I. That civil authority is of divine inſtitution.</item>
               <item>II. That civil authority is inſtituted for the good of the people in general, and for the benefit of the church of Chriſt in particular.</item>
               <item>III. What meaſures muſt the civil authority purſue to anſwer the end of their inſtitution?</item>
               <item>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:020469_0008_0FAF0CF18A8C5140"/>
IV. What are the obligations of ſubjects to the civil authority?</item>
            </list>
            <p>1. Civil authority is of Divine inſtitution.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He is the miniſter of God.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Order is Heaven's firſt law.</hi> Without it the gracious deſigns of the Creator cannot be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed. He has made his creatures of various powers and degrees; riſing by an eaſy and happy gradation, from the loweſt ſpecies of animals, to the moſt exalted rank of heavenly intelligencies. Creatures of the ſame ſpecies are conſtituted with certain differences, by which they greatly excel each other. Men, who are ſaid to be born in a ſtate of equality, are yet endowed with unequal meaſures of ſtrength and wiſdom. And hence there is a greater variety amongſt men, than amongſt ſeveral different ſpecies of animals. Some are qualified to teach and guide; others to be taught and led by their ſuperiors. To affirm that in the qualifications to rule and guide, all men are equal, is to blend characters totally diverſe, to confound wiſdom with folly, and affability and condeſcenſion with ill-nature and pride. There have ever been diſtinctions in the world, and various degrees amongſt men; while endowed
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:020469_0009_0FAF0CF1F247A4A0"/>
with ſuch various qualities and affections, the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinction will remain. To gainſay this diſtinction, is to counteract one of the principal laws of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity. Some muſt be in authority; others in ſubordination. And happy is that people who are allowed in Providence, to look out from among their brethren perſons of the beſt diſpoſition, and moſt aptly qualified to rule over them.</p>
            <p>THAT particular perſons ſhould be diſtinguiſhed and exalted in ſociety, may be argued from the methods of Providence, ever ſince man hath been upon earth. No people were ever able to ſubſiſt for any length of time, without forming into ſome kind of civil government, and ſetting aſide thoſe boaſted equalities, with which men are born into the world. They muſt be ſubject to ſome common rule and authority, in order to poſſeſs any meaſure of happineſs and ſecurity. Where there are no rulers to govern the community, all things are immediately involved in confuſion and miſery. The continuance of our original equality, is a ſtate of nature, and all ages have found a ſtate of nature to be a ſtate of war. Therefore it has pleaſed the common Parent of men, to lead them to a ſtate of civil ſubordination, by which a part of the community are intruſted to ordain and carry into effect, laws and regulations for the whole.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:020469_0010_0FAF0CF2AEA3E548"/>
THAT the eſtabliſhment of civil government is by the counſel and wiſdom of God, we are taught both from the hiſtory of his Providence, and the teſtimony of his inſpired truth. Iſrael, the people of his love, were formed into a civil community, and made ſubordinate to eſtabliſhed laws, to be adminiſtered by rulers appointed for that purpoſe. And it was a time of ſore rebuke, when there was no magiſtrate in the land of ſufficient authority, to put them in fear. The exaltation and degradation of rulers is the work of God, and not the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction of a blind and fortuitous chance, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the opinion of idle and infidel wits. <hi>For</hi> ſaith the word of enlightning truth,<note n="*" place="bottom">Pſalm, lxxv. 6, 7.</note> 
               <hi>Promotion cometh neither from the eaſt, nor from the weſt, nor from the ſouth. But God is the Judge; he putteth down one and ſetteth up another.</hi> The prerogative of or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daining magiſtracy and civil authority, belongs to our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; this claim he aſſumes to himſelf under the name of Wiſdom.<note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. viii. 15, 16.</note> 
               <hi>"By me Kings reign and Princes decree juſtice. By me Princes rule, and nobles, even all the judges of the earth."</hi> Theſe words imply the power of God, in ſupporting civil authority, and alſo his approbation of civil
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:020469_0011_0FAF0CF36B705C80"/>
magiſtracy, as one of the bleſſings of the Redeemer's purchaſe. In what eſtimation the bleſſing of civil government is holden by God, may be learned from that apoſtolical direction to Titus, how to teach the flock of Chriſt.<note n="*" place="bottom">Titus, iii. 1.</note> 
               <hi>"Put them in mind to be ſubject to principalities and powers, and to obey magiſtrates."</hi> So far is Chriſt intereſted in the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of civil authority, that he will acknowledge thoſe only to be his followers, who willingly obey rulers, and ſubmit to their adminiſtrations.</p>
            <p>BUT we need not go far for arguments: Our text is encompaſſed with proofs of the Divine in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of civil authority. The argument in the firſt verſe, for ſubjection to the <hi>higher powers,</hi> is, <hi>For there is no power but of God: the powers that be, are ordained of God.</hi> The reaſon alledged for not op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſing <hi>the power,</hi> is in the ſecond verſe. <hi>Whoſoever reſiſteth the power, reſiſteth the ordinance of God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and they that reſiſt ſhall receive to themſelves damnation.</hi> Thrice in this argument the Apoſtle ſtiles the magiſtrate, <hi>God's miniſter;</hi> that is, a public ſervant appointed by God. He is ſtiled alſo God's <hi>revenger to execute wrath upon him that doth evil.</hi> And Chriſtians muſt needs be ſubject, not only from fear and conſtraint, but chearfully in diſcharge of
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:020469_0012_0FAF0CF440BC4F08"/>
a good conſcience. Therefore our argument for the Divine inſtitution of civil authority, reſts upon the uniformity of Providence, in bringing man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind under government; upon the clear teſtimony of ſcripture; and upon our Lord's repeated in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions to his diſciples to yield a willing homage to rulers, even when they are neither of their faith, nor even of exemplary morals.</p>
            <p>NOT that God hath ordained any particular form of Government. This is left to the judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of men, and the circumſtances of particular countries and communities. But ſome govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is neceſſary. God wills mankind to be in ſubordination, and that they ſtand to each other in the relation of rulers and ſubjects. He does not ſet up the claim of Kings, to an indefeaſible and hereditary right: Such a claim is without ſupport in ſcripture, and is repugnant to common ſenſe. The leading idea of ſcripture is, That com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities conſtitute certain of their brethren to rule over them: and thus conſtituted, they are the <hi>ordinance</hi> of the Supreme Ruler.</p>
            <p>OUR argument is not, That every power which aſſumes to be authority is really ſo; or that God would have it acknowledged as his inſtitution.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020469_0013_0FAF0CF6CADBF010"/>
Uſurpers and incurable tyrants are not the ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God. Invaders are to be rejected as hoſtile to civil authority and ſubverſive of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> The Apoſtle would ſhow, That rulers allowed by long uſe, ſubmitted to by promiſes of allegiance, or introduced according to the ſtated maxims of the community over whom they pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide, are inveſted with power by God himſelf, and are to be obeyed by Chriſtians as his ordinance; and this, however their characters may be faulty, and their adminiſtrations in many reſpects inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicious and reprehenſible.</p>
            <p>I proceed to prove,</p>
            <p>II. THAT civil authority is inſtituted for the good of the people in general, and for the benefit of the church of Chriſt in particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>He is the Miniſter of God to</hi> THEE <hi>for</hi> GOOD.</p>
            <p>THAT God has inſtituted civil authority for the common good, is a full demonſtration, that he utterly abhors that tyranny and oppreſſion, which is ſo frequently practiſed by the inſolent Rulers of the earth: His benevolence is incenſed at the abuſe of his gifts, and the perverſion of thoſe powers and talents which he has beſtowed upon magiſtrates for the happineſs of his creatures. Rulers, who miſapply their authority for their
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:020469_0014_0FAF0CF7BAD13870"/>
perſonal advantage, and uſe the force of the State, to feed their ambition and revenge, or to gratify the guilty paſſions of minions and favourites, at the expence of publick miſery, are ſingular objects of Divine reſentment, and a ſtrange puniſhment is prepared for them by the righteous <hi>Avenger.</hi> No man has authority from God for partial advantage, but for the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon good. And while God ſuffers ſuch rulers to hold dominion among men, he utterly abhors the injuſtice and wickedneſs of their adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; he will bring to ſwift deſtruction theſe haughty oppreſſors of the nations, and proportion his plagues to their violence, and to the ſorrows which they have produced to their fellow men. He will eventually ſhew his power, and make his wrath known in their wonderful perdition.</p>
            <p>BUT let none imagine, that God has no gracious purpoſes to anſwer by an iniquitous adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of civil government. Inſatiable oppreſſors, bloody conquerors and imperial butchers, are of uſe in the ſcheme of Providence, to correct and amend the revolting tribes of men. While they make the earth to tremble, and turn fruitful fields into a deſolate wilderneſs, they are the meſſengers of divine diſpleaſure, the rod of God's anger, and the ſtaff of his indignation, againſt an hypocritical
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:020469_0015_0FAF0CF909A807D8"/>
and rebellious people. If a wiſe and merciful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration will not correct the diſſoluteneſs of an obdurate people, God ſcourges them with the ſtings of ſcorpions, with the relentleſs cruelty and ambition of unprincipled tyrants Such diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſations are neceſſary, both to reclaim the diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient, and as an example of retributive juſtice up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the incorrigible, that others may ſhun the rocks on which they ſplit.</p>
            <p>GOD's judgments are full of mercy. That greateſt temporal calamity which men experience, an unrighteous adminiſtration of civil power, has yet a gracious mixture of compaſſion, and tends to make perfect the ſcheme of Providence.</p>
            <p>BUT a good and equal adminiſtration of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, is a bleſſing to the community in a different ſenſe. The enjoyments and tranquility of ſubjects are ſecured by the protection of rulers. To ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance general happineſs, to ſecure property, to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe true, rational liberty, and to preſerve the lives of men, are the original purpoſes for which civil laws and magiſtrates are ordained by heaven. The Supreme Ruler has given to magiſtrates no warrant to purſue unequal or partial meaſures; to conſult perſonal or family intereſts; nor to foſter
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:020469_0016_0FAF0CF96D7E87B8"/>
the wiſhes and purſuits of cringing favourites.—The ſword of the ſtate is not committed to them for the excluſive advantage of particular ſocieties or claſſes of men. To promote the general good, to cheriſh virtue, and to diffuſe joyous proſperity through the whole community, are the ends for which God has exalted them to power. And they may purſue the intereſts of individuals, only in conſiſtency with the public benefit. The deſign of their inſtitution, is to encourage virtue, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect good men, to frown upon the courſes of the wicked, and to repreſs that fraud and injuſtice, by which oppreſſors conſume the faithful of the land, and devour the widow and him who hath no helper.</p>
            <p>OUR Apoſtle would teach the civil authority, that the great objects of their care, are to cheriſh virtue, and extirpate vice; to avenge public and individual wrongs; to curb the exceſſes of ſelfiſh avarice and ambition, and to foſter that philan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thropy and integrity, by which alone, nations can be built up and eſtabliſhed. And they would do well to remember, that not only the general wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the community is a principal object with all rulers who purſue the end of their appointment, but that God requires of them, a conſtant and
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:020469_0017_0FAF0CFA37257A38"/>
watchful attention to the happineſs of the church of Chriſt; and for this plain reaſon, that magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrates can in no way ſo ſubſtantially promote the common good, as by honouring the doctrines and followers of Jeſus. Whatever infidel wits may dream to the contrary, Jeſus Chriſt is appointed by the Father to an univerſal kingdom.<note n="*" place="bottom">John, v. 2<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="18" facs="unknown:020469_0018_0FAF0CFB0F0C4B80"/>
and all the revolutions of empire, have been in motion from the morning of time. It ſhould lie upon the minds of rulers, eſpecially of thoſe who make a profeſſion, <hi>that they believe the truth of the Chriſtian religion,</hi> to honour Chriſt by a true profeſſion, and an anſwerable life, and by their immediate regards in all their adminiſtrations, to the proſperity and dignity of Chriſt's family upon earth. This is God's governing end in their ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment to rule, that his children <hi>may lead peacea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and quiet lives in godlineſs and honeſty.</hi> It is a groſs miſtake, an affront upon the Lord of all worlds, to affirm, that civil magiſtrates have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to do for the church of Chriſt. Their para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount Sovereign, has taught them, that they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not diſcharge their civil truſt, without a diligent attention to his church upon earth. As well may the miniſter of an earthly Prince alledge, that he has nothing to do for the peace and dignity of his maſter's family, as civil rulers can alledge, that they have no concern with the church, the family of the King of Zion. The magiſtrates moſt aſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous and unwearied labours are due by his ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment to the church of God.</p>
            <p>OUR attention is called under the next head, to ſpecify,</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:020469_0019_0FAF0CFBB0B87538"/>
III. WHAT meaſures the civil authority muſt purſue, to anſwer the end of their inſtitution.</p>
            <p>THE God of Heaven, who ſetteth up Kings, and removeth Kings at his pleaſure, gives to rulers the kingdom, ſtrength, power, and glory, for the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his people. To anſwer this benevolent purpoſe of Heaven, ſhould be the magiſtrates firſt employment. How this purpoſe may be moſt ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually anſwered is our preſent enquiry. And here I ſhall be indulged in ſeveral particulars. And</p>
            <p>1ſt, To be the miniſter of God for good, the ruler muſt enterrain an ardent love for his people.</p>
            <p>LOVE is the main ſpring of every interchange of kind offices amongſt men. In no caſe has this Divine principle a more efficacious operation, than when the ruler's heart is inſpired with a pater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal affection towards his ſubjects. To be the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his people, is the magiſtrate's dignity: This conſtitutes his neareſt conformity to our uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal Parent: This will animate him to proſecute the common happineſs, under all temptations, and in ſeaſons of the moſt preſſing trials and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: Without this, he will faint under the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſeneſs and ingratitude of his people, when they oppoſe his labours for their good, and ill requite his faithful and painful ſervices for national eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:020469_0020_0FAF0CFC8F9D40E0"/>
and proſperity. Love animated the pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence and perſeverance of Moſes, to plead for Iſrael in their numerous rebellions, and finally to pledge his own proſperity, for their ſalvation, when he prayed that God would ſpare them, altho' to vindi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate his juſtice, he ſhould blot him out of his book; that is, cut him off from a name and inheritance among the tribes of the Lord, in the land of promiſe.</p>
            <p>THIS noble affection filled David with all the agonies of diſtreſs, and the importunity of prayer, that God would ſpare the ſheep of his flock, from the ſword of the deſtroying Angel, which was drawn over Jeruſalem. This fortified Nehemiah, to a life of ſelf-denial, conflict and danger, while he built the city of his father's ſepulchres. And this will give energy to the endeavours of all ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates for the proſperity of their brethren, and make them to eſteem diligence, watchfulneſs, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal expence, ſelf-denial, continual humiliation and ſupplication before God, but reaſonable and pleaſant ſervices for the public benefit. That he may purſue their proſperity, the ruler muſt cultivate at tender and benevolent affection for his people. Again,</p>
            <p>2dly, To be God's miniſter for good, the ruler muſt learn the characters and intereſt of his people.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:020469_0021_0FAF0CFED07F4828"/>
IGNORANT and uninformed Stateſmen, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever honeſt in their intentions, can do very little for the happineſs of the community. Their limit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed views create local prejudices, and ſubject them to the artifices of intereſted politicians. While a part of the community make undue advantages of their ignorant miſmanagement, the body lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhes and withers away for want of counſel, energy and uniformity in the civil adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It concerns rulers, therefore, to be well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the tempers, capacities, views and intereſts of the citizens, in all parts of their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that they may adapt their adminiſtration to the advantage of the whole, without material in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury to individuals. Rulers unacquainted with the intereſts of the ſeveral profeſſions, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation and capacities of the principal characters, will make grievous miſtakes in government, by confining their labours to a narrow circle, and by loſing the ſervices of the moſt ſuitable men in the community. What is more prepoſterous, than for rulers to exert their influence and authority, for the partial intereſt of the territory in their vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity, to make the intereſt of one claſs or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion yield to the avarice and ambition of an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other; to be a ſtickler for this or that faction in the State? A ruler ſhould have an enlarged heart,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:020469_0022_0FAF0CFFE1EC6AF0"/>
a noble, well-inſtructed mind; able to comprehend the characters and intereſts of his brethren, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, with a generous impartiality and diffuſive benevolence, to ſpeak peace to all his ſeed. And for this end he muſt ſtudy the diſpoſitions, the employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, the weakneſſes and abilities, and the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial intereſts of all his ſubjects. This know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge is eſſentially requiſite to be an uſeful and reputable magiſtrate. Again,</p>
            <p>3dly, To be a miniſter for good to the people, the ruler muſt be inſtructed in the political max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ims and laws of the State, in which he governs.</p>
            <p>THE ſafety of a people, eſpecially of a free peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, depends upon a ſacred adherence to the origi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal principles of their government. When thoſe principles are diſregarded, every bleſſing is inſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure, and the adminiſtration degenerates into an arbitrary deſpotiſm. Therefore rulers ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand the ſyſtem of laws, and thoſe forms of adminiſtration, to which the people are accuſtomed, and conform themſelves to thoſe original princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples; then they will have a line of conduct in their office, and the people will know what to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect from them. As a general knowledge of civil policy is neceſſary to make an <hi>accompliſhed</hi> ruler, ſo a thorough acquaintance with their own ſtate po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:020469_0023_0FAF0D002EDD0260"/>
is neceſſary to make a <hi>tolerable</hi> one. When ignorance is in place, the people will mourn, and folly and wickedneſs be exalted on every ſide. It was an eſſential qualification for government in Solomon,<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Kings, iv. 29.</note> That God had given him <hi>wiſdom and largeneſs of heart, very much, even as the ſand upon the ſea-ſhore.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Eccleſ. x. 16.</note> 
               <hi>Wo to thee, O land, when thy King is a child.</hi> The curſe of ignorant uninformed rulers, is taught us by the prophet Iſaiah,<note n="‡" place="bottom">Iſaiah, iii, 4, 12.</note> 
               <hi>And I will give children to be their Princes, and babes ſhall rule over them: As for my people, children are their oppreſſors, and woman rule over them: O my people, they which lead thee, cauſe thee to err.</hi> And ſaith Solomon,<note n="§" place="bottom">Prov. xxviii, 16.</note> 
               <hi>The Prince that wanteth underſtanding, is alſo a great oppreſſor.</hi> But by wiſdom and underſtanding the throne is eſtabliſhed, and the expectations of the people are richly gratified. No man therefore, ſhould undertake to rule amongſt men, until he is fully inſtructed into the civil conſtitution and laws of the community, where he is to govern. Again,</p>
            <p>4thly. To promote the public good, rulers muſt be controuled in all their meaſures, by truth and integrity.</p>
            <p>FOR wiſdom without integrity, will ſoon dege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerate into cunning and artifice, by which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of the community will fall a prey to thoſe
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:020469_0024_0FAF0D01234E44E0"/>
who ſhould be their friendly protectors. A magi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate without truth and ſincerity, is the ſnare and perdition of his ſubjects. All power ſhould be founded in truth, both in the attainment and exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe of it.<note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xii, 19.</note> 
               <hi>The lip of truth ſhall be eſtabliſhed for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever: but a lying tongue is but for a moment.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. xvii, 7.</note> 
               <hi>Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent ſpeech becometh not a fool, much leſs do lying lips a prince.</hi> An adminiſtration founded in truth and righteouſneſs, will bear the teſt of ſcrutiny: and meaſures dictated by honeſty, ſhall come forth ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved and proſperous in the end: while the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicity of deceitful politicians ſhall periſh, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volve both rulers and ſubjects in the ſnares of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexity and ruin. All men, eſpecially all leading men, carry their meaſures with the moſt ſucceſs and reputation, when they proſecute them with ſimple uniformity and honeſt ſincerity. It ſhould therefore be the firſt object with him who rules over men, to be juſt, to be true in his adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: not having a myſterious ſyſtem of delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to deceive others into his fraudulent inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
            <p>To gain the confidence of their ſubjects, rulers muſt be men upon whom they may ſafely depend. And without this confidence, ſubjects can derive very little advantage from government. Men in
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:020469_0025_0FAF0D01B1D504E0"/>
place, therefore, muſt make declarations and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes ſtrictly juſt and clearly intelligible, and by adhering to them, the ſubject muſt know what to expect from authority. Rulers, to be uſeful, muſt deal fairly and honeſtly with the people; diſtribute equal juſtice; protect them from wrongs, and puniſh injuries with integrity and deciſion: not leave honeſt men the prey of fraud.</p>
            <p>IT is a ſad time, when rulers are ſo inattentive to juſtice and veracity, that truth falleth in the ſtreets, and he who departeth from iniquity, maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf a prey. Good rulers make fair promiſes and keep them, and are exemplary in fulfiling con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts. The magiſtrate who defrauds his ſubjects, will have a poor face to puniſh individuals who defraud one another. Do rulers wiſh to be pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic bleſſings? then let them keep good the public faith, ſuſtain the credit of the ſtate, and pay punctually the public contracts. This will give energy to government, eſtabliſh the influence and credit of authority, and teach the people that up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rightneſs and veracity, by which alone the various members of ſociety can be cloſely cemented. A diſſembler and a cheat among individuals, is a baſe character; and a fraudulent adminiſtration of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, is a character as much more deteſtible, as the number and authority of the rulers exceed
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:020469_0026_0FAF0D026FB73D90"/>
one individual. Some have acted as though a fraud or falſehood might be loſt in the number of partners, or be ſanctified by great and powerful names: But he who ſitteth in the Heavens, will manifeſt their error, and prove,<note n="*" place="bottom">Prov. xii. 22.</note> 
               <hi>that lying lips are an abomination to the Lord, that they are but for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that the feet of unrighteous rulers ſtand in ſlippery places; and when the good man ſeeth their end, he ſhall ſuddenly curſe their habitation. Does the ruler wiſh to be uſeful and reputable? Let him be a true and honeſt man. Would he involve himſelf and the community in infamy and perplexity? Let him be unequal in his admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations; let his performances contradict his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; by falſe weights and falſe meaſures of juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and equity, let him frame iniquity by law, and teach the Lord's people to tranſgreſs. Again,</p>
            <p>5thly, To rule well, the magiſtrate muſt cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivate habits of induſtry and frugality.</p>
            <p>RULERS have ſo much to do, that they have no time to loſe. An indolent ruler, like the uſeleſs and unwieldly drone, devours the honey which others have gathered. He conſumes the people's tribute without earning it. The ſupport which
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:020469_0027_0FAF0D034510CC78"/>
ſubjects ſhould liberally furniſh for the mainten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of government, rulers ſhould merit by their diligent ſervices. And while they carefully avoid avarice in withholding expences for the public good, it concerns them to uſe the revenues of the State, with oeconomy, that no part of the public treaſure be applied to uſeleſs and triffling purpoſes. Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetouſneſs and prodigality are both miſchievous vices in rulers, and they ſhould avoid each ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme, if they would be bleſſings to the people.</p>
            <p>INDOLENT rulers will be otherways vicious. Idleneſs will cloud their minds and extinguiſh the nobler ſenſations of the ſoul, and the moſt noxious weeds will ſpring up in their place. By their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, habits of idleneſs, intemperance, diſſipation, gaming and profaneneſs, like ſome infectious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, will ſpread through all ranks of people. An enervated, poor and contemptible people will be the conſequence of an indolent and diſſipated ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of government. Such wicked rulers will rule over a poor, worthleſs people; the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity will ſink into effeminacy, dependance and wretchedneſs. It becomes the magiſtrate then to be a man of buſineſs, not a man of pleaſure; to be attentive to his office, and painful in his exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions for the common good. Thus ſhall his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:020469_0028_0FAF0D042A947788"/>
recommend hardineſs, patience, frugality and ſelf-denial to his ſubjects, and through the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of theſe virtues, they ſhall be able to meet the enemy in the gate, and riſe with luſtre among the nations. It was the maxim of a Grecian Prince, worthy to be adopted by the Chriſtian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate, <hi>It ill becomes a Stateſman, to ſleep all night.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE virtues of induſtry, and well-judged fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, are the ſupport of republican governments, and are therefore peculiarly requiſite in their civil authority, who by their example, ſhould teach the people habits of diligence, hardineſs and oecono<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, not to conſume, according to the baneful cuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms of our republics, in diſſipation and luxury, much more than we earn by our labour and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtry. Again,</p>
            <p>6thly, To anſwer the purpoſe of their inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, civil rulers muſt protect good citizens, and puniſh the wicked.</p>
            <p>THE ſcripture character of rulers is, <hi>That they are not a terror to good works, but to the evil.</hi> Power is groſsly abuſed and perverted, when wicked citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens are foſtered and protected by authority.

<pb n="29" facs="unknown:020469_0029_0FAF0D04AB2359A8"/>
that vile men are exalted and ſcreened from juſtice. No favour or friendſhip, no relation or connection with men in power, ſhould cover the wicked from puniſhment. Rulers are to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the laws: And the laws are made for the lawleſs and diſobedient. All delays of juſtice, the exemption from chaſtiſement, which corrupt citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens receive in breaking the peace and violating the ordinances of juſtice, is a ſore malady in the State, and proves that the head is ſick and the heart faint. Good magiſtrates, by their influence, ſuppreſs immorality, and every tranſgreſſion of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lative juſtice. God commands it, and faithful ſubjects have a claim upon their rulers, to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected from fraud and oppreſſion, to have the laws executed, their perſons, their liberty and proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty protected, from the depredations of deſigning and unprincipled men. And the magiſtrate who does not endeavour to puniſh and reclaim, or ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terly to purge from the State wicked and diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient ſubjects, forgets the main deſign of his ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>altation. And when good men are left to the fear and danger of loſing their privileges and poſſeſſions, they are ſadly neglected; and the God of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, will avenge their quarrel againſt ſuch ſlothful and unrighteous magiſtrates. To let the wicked

7thly, RULERS, to be miniſters of God for good, muſt be men of religion.</p>
            <p>ALL chriſtian graces are of immediate uſe in the adminiſtration of government. And as rulers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive their ordination from God, he expects that as ſervants they honour him, and obey his Son Jeſus Chriſt, as their liege Lord. Since religion furniſhes men with thoſe excelling gifts and good diſpoſitions, which qualify them to govern, ſo they can never cultivate faith and piety with too care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful an aſſiduity. Their ſucceſs in office, and their uſefulneſs among their ſubjects, depend primarily upon the Divine preſence and bleſſing. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore they ſhould be men of exemplary faith in their King and Saviour, and not lean unto their own underſtanding. That illuſtrious magiſtrate Nehemiah, thought it a moſt eſſential qualification in his brother Hananiah, to take charge over Jeruſalem.<note n="*" place="bottom">Neh. vii. 2.</note> 
               <hi>Becauſe he was a faithful man and feared God above many.</hi> Magiſtrates ſhould be men of prayer, that God may dwell with them and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect their counſels. They ſhould be accuſtomed to appear before God in the poſture of ſuppliants, that he would enlighten their ignorance, and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per their exertions. None have more need of wiſdom, than they; and to whom ſhould they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:020469_0032_0FAF0D07FAFF8018"/>
but to him <hi>who giveth to all men liberally, and up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braideth not.</hi> Would they be honoured by the obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience of their ſubjects? Let them obtain this ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour by obeying God, by lives of temperance, ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>briety and a becoming gravity. Like their bleſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Maſter, let them be meek, humble and gentle towards all men; like him, love righteouſneſs and hate iniquity, be conſtant, watchful and fervant in duty, bearing the ſorrows, and relieving the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of their fellow men; like him <hi>go about doing good.</hi> It is incumbent upon them, to honor Chriſt in his inſtitutions, ſetting a pattern before their bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren of family religion, reſolving with the pious and valiant Joſhua, That as for us and our houſes, we will ſerve the Lord; attending uniformly upon the ordinances of public worſhip, hallowing God's Sabbaths, and reverencing his ſanctuary, attentive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly waiting upon the diſpenſation of the goſpel. From rulers we may well expect ſubmiſſion to all God's commandments, and that they cheriſh the appointed means of diffuſſing chriſtian knowledge, and by honouring Chriſt's miniſters and followers, become <hi>nurſing fathers to the Church.</hi> Some have thought that religion is no important part of a ruler's character: It is true, that rulers without religion are to be obeyed. But when it is conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:020469_0033_0FAF0D086F48A510"/>
that they are made rulers ultimately for the good and proſperity of the Church, we muſt cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure thoſe for their ignorance or irreligion, who adopt a maxim ſo pernicious to civil ſociety, and embarraſſing to the intereſts of virtue and morali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Without religion, rulers have no God, unto whom they may repair and expect his bleſſing up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their adminiſtration. God is not with them, and when his preſence is withdrawn, darkneſs and perplexity will fill their paths with ſnares and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſity. Immoral and ungodly rulers may affect courteſy, affability and patriotiſm to gain popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity; but they have no moral principle upon which the public may depend, and too often have they proved the ſcourge of the community, and the rod of God's indignation againſt a profane or hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocritical people. Therefore we lay it down as a qualification of great moment to the State, that magiſtrates be men of piety, who have a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing regard to the glory of God, and a warm affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for the goſpel of Chriſt. Such are the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments avowed in our form of government, which requires the great officers of government, before they enter upon their truſt, to declare their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief of the Chriſtian religion, as the religion taught from Heaven, for the happineſs and ſalvation of loſt men. Again.</p>

8thly, To influence them to a uſeful diſcharge of their truſt, it is important, that rulers keep in mind their mortality and their future account be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bar of God.</p>
            <p>

exact proportion to their benevolence and fidelity, not according to their power and authority; and that their puniſhment will not be alleviated by any inſtances of preſent impunity from the impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of human juſtice: but according to their ſloth and luxury, their wantonneſs and ambition, their oppreſſion and avarice, ſuch will be their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribution from the ſentence of the Lord of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baoth, who hears the groans of injured and neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſubjects, and has prepared a ſtrange puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the haughty oppreſſors of the earth.</p>
            <p>WERE this day of retribution, which will ſoon overtake us all, duely realized by magiſtrates, how could they fail to diſcharge with aſſiduity and care their ſacred truſt, and to be in earneſt to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come miniſters of God for good, to the people? Having ſtated the methods, by which rulers may anſwer the benevolent purpoſes of Heaven in their appointment, it concerns us under the laſt general head,</p>
            <p>IV. To point out the obligations of ſubjects to the civil authority.</p>
            <p>IT is the prerogative of a free people to appoint men from among their brethren to rule over them. It is their duty and only ſecurity to uſe this prero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative with diſcretion and fidelity,<note n="*" place="bottom">1 Pet. ii. 16.</note>

They ſhould ſtrengthen the hands of their rulers in the work of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, treat with liberality their adminiſtrations, and ſtudiouſly avoid a mean ſpirit of jealouſy and ſuſpicion, that bane of ſociety and deſtruction of public bleſſings. A haughty, unyielding and mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring diſpoſition, is the infamy of ſubjects, and will prove their eventual ruin from the juſtice of God, who wills that his ordinances be reſpected by men. They <hi>who deſpiſe government, are pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, ſelf-willed, and are not afraid to ſpeak evil of dignities, and ſpeak evil of things which they know not,</hi> have little ſenſe of their duty to magiſtrates, are diſturbers of the public peace, and <hi>ſhall utterly periſh in their own corruption.</hi>

is a leading duty, That ſubjects pray for their rulers, and offer up in public and private, acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgements for the bleſſings of government, and ſupplications for Divine favour upon the civil adminiſtration.

Men who reſiſt lawful authority, and are engaged in tumults and confuſion, may be fit for the realms of anarchy, darkneſs and deſpotiſm; but without repentance they ſhall never behold the ſeats of the bleſſed, where every man is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with his ſtation. Do we wiſh for preſent ſecurity and enjoyment, for national ſtrength and dignity? Do we wiſh to behold the ſeats of the bleſſed? Then we muſt obey magiſtrates.</p>
            <p>I HAVE finiſhed my doctrinal obſervations; may I be indulged in ſome practical reflections, and ſundry curſory obſervations upon the preſent ſituation of this Commonwealth, and the methods which God requires to be purſued for reſtoring and lengthening out our tranquility, and then conclude with addreſſes ſuited to this important occaſion.

THIS country was planted by men of ſingular piety, of whom the old world was not worthy. God found them a refuge from the oppreſſion of civil and ſpiritual tyranny. Having planted, he protected them from the moſt preſſing dangers. Often hath he delivered them by ſigns and wonders, and by an out-ſtretched arm. In ſome feeble mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure our Forefathers lived worthy of the Divine care over them, and by grateful obedience ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the ſalvations wrought for them. But their children forgat his benefits, and by ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion and ſenſuality, by diſſipation and luxury, by worldlineſs and pride, they provoked the Holy One of Iſrael, to threaten them with the loſs of thoſe privileges and bleſſings, which he had ſo richly beſtowed, and they had ſo unthankfully abuſed.</p>
            <p>MANY have celebrated the virtues, and confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently predicted the riſing glories of the American States. But while we continue our provocations, we may do well to enquire, Whether theſe flat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tering panegyriſts <hi>do not ſpeak to us ſmooth things, and propheſy deceits?</hi> Would not the ſublime prophet Iſaiah addreſs us in another ſtile?<note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah i. 2, 4.</note>

with iniquity, a ſeed of evil doers, children that are corrupters, they have forſaken the Lord, they have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voked the Holy One of Iſrael unto anger, they have gone away backward.</hi> Becauſe the Lord was wroth with his heritage, he did of late raiſe up adverſaries unto them of their brethren. The Britiſh parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſupport of a groundleſs claim, levied an unnatural war againſt us, and aſſumed without warrant to be the Higher Powers in our govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</p>
            <p>BY the will of God, and the direction of his ordinance, our civil authority, to whom our firſt, allegiance was due, we were called to contend for our poſſeſſions, our liberties and our lives, even unto blood. Long and diſtreſſing was the conflict. In the confuſions of war, and eſpecially in the perplexities of ſuch a war, in which the minds of the people were divided as to their duties of alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giance, order and government were eſſentially injured amongſt us, and that ſpirit of ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation and loyalty, which was before habitual, was nearly loſt, and for a ſeaſon we were threatened with all the miſeries of that people, who have no magiſtrate to put them in ſear. But in the ſeaſon of our declenſions, He who remembereth mercy for his people, interpoſed for our help, and in due time ordained peace for us. But in nothing
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:020469_0041_0FAF0D0FF6A86E80"/>
was his grace more remarkable than in leading us out of a diſtempered ſtate of partial anarchy into a ſtate of order and government. He gave us laws and teſtimonies right and good, a civil conſtitution perhaps the moſt perfect in the world, which is the ſecurity of good citizens, the admiration of the wiſe, and the envy of tyrants: To which if if we ſtrictly adhere, we cannot in a political ſenſe, fail of being a happy people.</p>
            <p>SINCE this mercy of our God upon us, in ſaving us from the evils of war, and plucking us from the confuſions of anarchy, we have walked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy of his great goodneſs. We ſang his praiſes, but ſoon forgot his benefits. We have continued to indulge thoſe follies and exceſſes, for which he had already chaſtized us. While deeply in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volved in debt, our diſtempered paſſion for the faſhions of luxurious and affluent nations, plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us into our former prodigality and unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fitable expences. Inſtead of applying ourſelves to diſcharge the claims of public and private cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, and thus to vindicate our honour and independence, we employed the riches of our ſoil in purchaſing the trappings of an exotic dreſs, and in indulging our vitiated appetites in the expenſive productions of diſtant regions, and thus are we become the ſervants of foreigners, and ſtrangers
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:020469_0042_0FAF0D10AFBB6BE0"/>
rule over us. Poor and dependent, our minds are enervated to the purſuits of national freedom and dignity. And yet reſtleſs under the unavoidable preſſure of our follies, we are little inclined to ſatisfy our creditors, and pay the price of our beloved diſſipation. Like the prodigal, exhauſted and worn down by riot, we complain of our pains and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſments, and idly reſolve into a grievance, that poverty, from which no created power but our own can ſave us. Jaded by our vices, indigent through profuſe living, rendered untractable by long exemption from the reſtraints of human and Divine laws, and proud in a licentious liberty, that fore-runner of deſpotiſm, we have become reſtleſs under neceſſary burdens, and with a miſtaken reſentment, have complained of public requiſitions as the ſource of our ſorrows and perplexities. Laviſh expences have made us poor, and a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per not duly ſubordinate, has turned our com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints from our own follies, againſt our Fathers, our beſt friends and benefactors. How many of us have laboured to free ourſelves from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary burdens of public and private debts, that we might obtain a wider ſcope for the indulgence of appetites, which it were much better to mortify?</p>
            <p>WILL the enquiry be thought immodeſt, when I aſk, whether our wealthy and leading characters,
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:020469_0043_0FAF0D116D51B710"/>
have not been firſt in this tranſgreſſion? Of the legiſlators of our republican government, we might have expected effectual laws to diſcourage exceſſes, by which the citizens are ſo certainly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graded to a ſtate of ſervility and dependence. They knew better than their conſtituents, the evil of ſuch exceſſes. Might they not in due ſeaſon, have encouraged induſtry, temperance and fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, among the people; laid reſtrictions upon foreign luxuries, and made it as neceſſary as it was uſeful, for the people to produce the accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of life by their own labour, and upon their own ſoil. And eſpecially might not the exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of men in power, and families of faſhion and affluence, in preferring the productions of our own country, to commodities received from abroad, have produced the moſt ſalutary effects among all claſſes of our citizens? Such examples would have been more influential and authoritative, than a whole code of commercial regulations. This is one of our wounds; I mention it freely, ſince I hope in a good Providence, that our rulers, our public teachers and the multitude of our brethren, will think it important to apply themſelves to a radi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal cure of the evil. For nothing kills the noble ſpirit of freedom, like a ſtate of dependence, which

will ever attend the folly of ſpending more than we earn. Let our rulers not merely in word, but in deed, by a laudable example, be firſt in this matter, and teach republicans to be honeſt, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious and frugal in their modes of living. Then ſhall ſubſtantial wealth and independence be the joyous portion, of all claſſes of our happy ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizens.</p>

The objects ſought after, in theſe tumults, have been of the moſt faulty kind. One avowed end was to compel the Legiſlature, into an emiſſion of a paper currency, to be a tender in payment of all public and private contracts. A meaſure wholly prepoſterous, when the public ought to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charging their old obligations, and not contracting a new debt by borrowing money by an emiſſion of paper; a meaſure totally unjuſt, and as truly impolitic as to adminiſter opiates to cure a lethar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. The faultineſs of ſuch violent attempts aroſe alſo from the utter impoſſibility in the preſent ſtate of our affairs, that the Legiſlature could make a promiſe upon their paper and keep it; that is, they could never honeſtly redeem the money, by ſaving it from a rapid depreciation, and making punctual payment. Such a meaſure then, would have been a groſs violation of commuta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive juſtice, the unwavering obſervance of which, is enjoined upon all bodies of men under all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble circumſtances. To endeavour by hoſtility to compel the Legiſlature into a meaſure, which they wiſely thought impolitic, and knew to be palpably unjuſt, was an high handed offence, and clearly proves, that multitudes were under the clouds of God's anger, and were ſadly forſaken of reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing grace.</p>

BUT the deſign was filled with other miſchiefs. It was to wreſt from the Legiſlature the power of governing; from the tribunals of law the power of decreeing juſtice; and from the Executive, the eſſential prerogative of carrying into effect the laws of the Commonwealth. Thus were our foundations to have been deſtroyed. The declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed intentions of the male-contents, and what they attempted by levying an impious war upon their country, was to arreſt the arm of government, and ſeize the adminiſtration of a deſpotic rule into their own hands; to ſap the foundations of our glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſtitution, to change its eſſential forms, and thus to break down the barriers of our rights, and overwhelm this great republic in dreary confuſion and irretrievable ruin.

<pb n="47" facs="unknown:020469_0047_0FAF0D16B042CC20"/>
the Father of mercies, That in the ſeaſon of alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dangers, he raiſed up an adminiſtration of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, who, in the faithful page of hiſtory, will be celebrated for their wiſdom, their modera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and integrity.</p>
            <p>AFTER many outrageous and treaſonable ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſes, had prevailed, in ſeveral parts of the State, and the lives and eſtates of their guilty authors were forfeited to their country, our Chief Magiſtrate, at the requeſt of the Legiſlature, offered a free and full pardon to all the promoters and abettors of thoſe ſeditious tumults. Through an infatuated obduracy, that pardon was ſcornfully rejected, even under the cleareſt light and evidence exhibited to them, that their complaints were groundleſs, and that the government had been adminiſtered with great integrity. Former violences were renewed, the criminal demands of the inſurgents increaſed, and the exiſtence of the Commonwealth, was put to the hazard. When unmixed mercy could not reclaim but raiſed to higher exceſſes the reſiſtance of the offenders, authority aſſumed a more firm and deciſive tone, and raiſed a military force to repel their violence. Yet great was the forbearance and compaſſion of government in all their exertions to ſuppreſs the rebellion. Forgiveneſs was ſtill ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:020469_0048_0FAF0D16D07E9860"/>
to the body of the rebels, the leaders only were left to the juſtice of the law, and even with the leaders much lenity was uſed by proffering terms of pardon to many of them. The ſteps of our civil adminiſtration were the marks of their juſtice and humanity. The wiſdom and deciſion of the Council, demand our admiration and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude: the meaſures of our Chief Magiſtrate all de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noted the firmneſs of his ſpirit, his regard for our laws, his inflexible adherence to the principles of the conſtitution, and his unſhaken determination to protect his country, and repreſs the violence of wicked men. His conduct was equally diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed for benignity and moderation, that aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from bloodſhed and that ardent wiſh to reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and preſerve offenders, which is a ſhining part of the character of a good man and a chriſtian ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrate. He hath ſhewed himſelf <hi>the</hi> FATHER <hi>and</hi> FRIEND <hi>of his country. The miniſter of God for good to his people.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THAT worthy perſonage who acted under his immediate orders in ſuppreſſing the public com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions, has added freſh laurels to his former ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, and evinced how much he deſerves the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of the CHRISTIAN HERO. The officers and men employed in this important and unwelcome
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:020469_0049_0FAF0D17C9A014B0"/>
ſervice, by their firm, temperate and wiſe conduct, diſcovered that excellent ſpirit which ought ever to reign in the boſoms of free citizens. Ye au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors and leaders of theſe happy operations, if we forget your ſervices, let our right hand forget its cunning. Thou country <hi>thus</hi> ſaved of the Lord from the horns of the unicorn, if we do not remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber thee above our chief joy, let our tongue cleave to the roof of our mouth.</p>
            <p>THRONES of judgement are eſtabliſhed, and the ſeat of violence is driven from us: and by the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interrupted execution of our wholeſome laws, we may ſit quietly under our own vines and under our own fig-trees. And we may gladly hope, that without connivance from men of influence, theſe ſeeds of ſedition will e'er long be totally eradicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from our republic. The methods of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence in protecting the Commonwealth and ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding the meaſures of government, merit parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular notice and unfeigned gratitude. The ſinger of God has been conſpicuous in directing and proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering our public counſels. Operations dictated by wiſdom and moderation, have been ſucceeded by remarkable interp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

<pb n="50" facs="unknown:020469_0050_0FAF0D1835A77940"/>
could perform no part of their enterprize; and the meaſures of adminiſtration were crowned with the wiſhed for ſucceſs.</p>
            <p>MAY the author of all effectual influences impreſs the minds of deluded citizens with a conviction of the criminality of their conduct, and of the evident hand of God, which was lifted up againſt them. It is but juſtice to obſerve, that the meaſures of government, have been conformable to the ſyſtem of God's government over a ſinful world. Mercy has been freely proffered, and when deſpiſed, has been followed by a mixture of judgement and mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. Becauſe the Lord loved his people, he hath inclined the hearts of their rulers into ſuch a proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous and ſalutary adminiſtration. To regard theſe foot-ſteps of Providence, and purſue a ſimilar ſyſtem of adminiſtration, can ſcarcely fail to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover us from our confuſions, and eſtabliſh our public tranquility. But inattention to the ſinger of God, and an abuſe of his healing mercies, the continuance of our rebellions and reſiſtance of his civil ordinance, will provoke him to empty us from veſſel to veſſel, <hi>and for the iniquities of our land, many will be the rulers thereof: unſtable as water we ſhall not excel.</hi> But if conſcious of paſt ingratitude and abuſe of bleſſings, we will turn unto him by

            <p>THAT happy tranquillity which we enjoyed under your former adminiſtration, cannot fail to excite our congratulations, that God has ſo far reſtored your health, that you are able to accept the Chief Magiſtracy in this Commonwealth. Appointed by God to bear rule over your bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, you will be pleaſed to accept our beſt wiſhes that your health may be adequate to the weighty burthens of your high and ſacred office. Our prayer to the Almighty is, that he would be the health of your countenance and your God; that he would ſtrengthen you to eminent uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs among his people. May divine preſervation and illumination accompany your adminiſtrations, that you may continue to act worthily for Chriſt our King, and be accepted of the multitude of your brethren. May that diffuſive love which you ſo early manifeſted for your country, by placing yourſelf in the firſt rank of dangers, to repel foreign uſurpation, and vindicate the privileges and laws of your country, ſtill animate you, to purſue the happineſs of the community, by ſupporting the dignity of civil authority, the prerogatives and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependence of the Supreme Executive, and the other branches of adminiſtration; by making law terrible to all invaders and uſurpers of the powers

            <p>WITH pleaſing anticipation, we behold your Excellency God's miniſter for good, bearing the ſword of the State, not as a terror to good works, but to the evil. Our eye with delight marks your path, while you lead us your children into the duties of relative and Chriſtian life, and by your example teach us, that ſelf-denial, frugality and induſtry, ſo eſſential to the happineſs of a free people. From your Excellency, will our Legiſlature expect advice in thoſe meaſures, which may main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain inviolate the principles of our civil conſtitution againſt every ſpecies of encroachment; how the public good is to be purſued, honeſty and integrity, diligence and application encouraged, and diſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation driven from the State; how the laws of juſtice may be effectually vindicated, and the ſeat of fraud and oppreſſion, be removed far from us. Our expectations are from your Excellency, That liberty ſhall be maintained by law, and all ſubjects be ſecure in their poſſeſſions; that public faith, and national credit and dignity, be ſollicitouſly preſerved.</p>

            <p>WE hope in the goodneſs of the univerſal Parent, that by affording you his preſence and grace, he will ſhew, that becauſe he loved his people, he hath therefore appointed you to rule over them. From your Excellency, the intereſts of piety and the Chriſtian religion, juſtly expect continual aid and friendly countenance. May the Angel of the Divine preſence, enlighten and beautify the paths of your adminiſtration. In your days, religion, truth and peace dwell on the earth, and after you have ſerved your generation by the will of God, may you receive the rewards of your fidelity, from the approbation of your Judge. May you here enjoy a portion, better than many ſons, and late be welcomed to the preſence of your Divine Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our and Judge, and from him obtain that Crown of glory which fadeth not away.</p>

OUR reſpects are now due to the Gentlemen who compoſe the Honourable the Senate, and the Honourable the Houſe of Repreſentatives.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Fathers of our country, and Elders of our tribes,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>YOU are this day conſtituted by Jeſus Chriſt, the ordinance of God, for the good of his church, and the welfare of this Commonwealth. The oath of God is upon you, to maintain the laws of the State, and the ſacred principles of our excellent conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: A conſtitution which wiſdom will approve, as the national bulwark of our independence and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty, the effectual protection of good citizens, the ſecurity of freedom, property and life, and our defence againſt the rude encroachments of anarchy and deſpotiſm. You have this day declared your belief of the Chriſtian religion. Integrity in this profeſſion will lead you to prize our conſtitution the more, ſince it is ſo friendly to morality, and the Chriſtian faith. You have bound yourſelves in the diſcharge of your office, to promote the common good upon goſpel principles; by cultivat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in your temper, and practice, thoſe benevolent graces of Chriſtianity, which will enable you to rule with reputation to yourſelves, and advantage to the people. You have pledged yourſelves to honor Chriſt's inſtitutions, to protect his ſervants, to diſcountenance all contempt of the doctrines
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:020469_0056_0FAF0D1CCF8C9358"/>
and maxims of his holy faith. Thus from the manner of your inauguration, we may expect, that you be nurſing Fathers to the Church. It becomes a miniſter of that Church, (and will there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore be acceptable to you) to ſtir up your pure minds to uſe the gift that is in you, for the good of the people. You are the Miniſters of God, and as ſuch, accountable at the tribunal of the Son of Man, in the great day of dread deciſion. Let me exhort you as candidates for eternity, to keep in mind that ſolemn day, and as faithful ſervants, to be habitually prepared for it. And that through Divine grace, you may give up a good account at laſt, be entreated to regard the eye of God, which is upon you, and look to him to pardon your un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs, to counſel you by his unerring wiſdom, and to quicken you by his truth: That he would not take his Holy Spirit from you, but by his effectual influences, guide you into the paths of uprightneſs. The ſcriptures will teach you your liableneſs to err; and your deſire to be uſeful, will excite your applications for that anointing of the Holy One, by which you will not err fatally. As Rulers, it concerns you to be men of prayer, to maintain an intercourſe with Heaven, and an humble dependance upon Divine teaching and guidance. Do you wiſh to be honoured of God in your office? You muſt honour him by ſubmit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:020469_0057_0FAF0D1D6E382358"/>
your adminiſtrations to his government, by a reſpect to his name, his inſtitutions and thoſe eternal laws of righteouſneſs, ordained for the careful obſervance of all his rational ſubjects. With you <hi>the fear of the Lord is the beginning of wiſdom, and to depart from evil is underſtanding.</hi>—To you as their Fathers, will the people look for patterns of moral and Chriſtian duty. You will therefore go before them in perſonal, in family and public religion and obedience. Care for the State will arm your zeal and fortitude againſt vicious and immoral practices, to frown upon groſs breaches of human and Divine laws. Your ſervices will be approved of God, and uſeful to the community, whenever you ſhall puniſh with deciſion and impartiality, the lawleſs practices of vicious and diſobedient ſubjects. Through your example and official exertions ſhall thoſe virtues of benevolence, integrity, induſtry and frugality, ſo eſſential to a republican and Chriſtian community, greatly prevail. And your teſtimony ſhall ſuppreſs the inſolence of fraud and injuſtice, falſhood and perjury, by which the bonds of ſociety are diſſolved. May the oath of God become terrible, and all human promiſes and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracts be held ſacred. Punctuality in Rulers to their contracts, is the firſt ſtep towards a general
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:020469_0058_0FAF0D1FB503A3D8"/>
honeſty in the State. Their example gives energy to laws againſt private fraud and injuſtice. You will feel the bond of that law of your Maſter, <hi>to owe no man any thing;</hi> but according to the ability of the people, to make a punctual and ſatisfactory payment of public debts. You will utterly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>allow all meaſures, which may put honeſt and feeble citizens into the power of griping and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>principled oppreſſors; than ſuch meaſures, nothing is more repugnant to that Goſpel, by which you are to be judged. Every indirect method to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tricate the people from embarraſſments, is a new load to ſink them in the mire. The Fathers of our tribes will therefore cultivate public and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate faith, and learn us all <hi>not to go beyond, or to defraud our neighbour.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MAY the good God influence our honourable Legiſlature, into a ſyſtem of adminiſtration, which ſhall defend our Conſtitution, render venerable our laws, protect from violence the ſeats of Juſtice and the Throne of Judgement, and by a due mixture of mercy and juſtice, allure offenders to obedience, or by adequate penalties incapaciate them from diſturbing the public tranquility. You will think nothing too much to encourage a ſpirit of loyalty and patriotiſm; and to this end you will
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:020469_0059_0FAF0D20AD0D91C0"/>
encourage the means of grace and education. To your wiſdom does it belong to diſcover the political meaſures, for promoting the good deſigns which have been mentioned, but I may ſuggeſt, that they ſhould be ſuch as are approved by the goſpel of Chriſt.</p>
            <p>OUR national concerns, as a confederated Republic, are ſerious concerns. Your deliberate counſels will be requiſite to invent ſome remedy for our national imbecility and reproach. Unleſs effectual and liberal meaſures are ſoon taken, our glory and independence will vaniſh into air. Be intreated Fathers, to lay aſide limited views and local prejudices, and to encompaſs the Union in the exertions of your wiſdom and patriotiſm.</p>

               </gap> anſwer the ends of your appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, you will conſider it highly important, in ſiding up the vacancies in the Legiſlature, and in conſtituting a Council for His Excellency, to chooſe faithful and approved men, who fear God and obey Chriſt above many, men of noble minds, ſuperiour to intrigue, and unfettered by faction, of independent ſentiments, who abhor covetous practices, men whoſe circumſtances are not em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>barraſſed, and who will not fear to do the thing
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:020469_0060_0FAF0D212F8A8C28"/>
which is juſt, who love the people, and will by perſonal labours and ſelf-denial, and unwearied diligence, purſue their ſolid and laſting advantages, and yet diſdain by meanneſs and artifice, and by ſacrificing their own judgement, to gain an empty popular applauſe.</p>
            <p>A LEGISLATURE thus conſtituted, and what a reſpectable number of ſuch amiable and worthy characters do I now behold; ſuch a Legiſlature, ſhall in the iſſue enjoy the bleſſings of their country, while time ſerving politicians, ſhall ſink in the dirt of their deſerved ignominy: Such a Legiſlature may hope to have God with them, to proſper the work of their hands. From the faithful diſcharge of an earthly truſt, they ſhall in their time and order, be received to the plaudit of their final Judge. Such is the reward which we pray that every member of our public adminiſtration, in the Executive, Legiſlative and Judicial department, may now deſerve, and in future obtain from the mouth of him, who ſiteth upon the Throne.</p>
            <p>MAY we all repent, and do our firſt works, that God may be in the midſt of us. That he may ſit in the aſſembly of our Rulers, is the devout ſupplication of all, who hope in his mercy, and wiſh well to this Commonwealth.</p>

               <pb n="61" facs="unknown:020469_0061_0FAF0D2267B8BF38"/>
BLESSED art thou O Land, when thy King is the Son of nobles, and thy Princes eat in due ſeaſon. <hi>Happy is</hi> that people, that is in ſuch a caſe; yea happy is that people, whoſe God is the Lord.</p>
            <p>THUS with ſincerity, and as well as I was able, have I ſpoken unto you the Lord's meſſage. May the effectual co-operations of the Bleſſed Spirit, render the truths which have been delivered, uſeful to this whole Aſſembly, and by the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent fruits may it appear, that in very deed God has been among us.
