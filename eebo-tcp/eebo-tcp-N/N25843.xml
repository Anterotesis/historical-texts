            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFATORY ADDRESS TO THE READER.</head>
            <p>FROM a deep ſenſe of the manifold favors, and repeated bleſſings vouchſafed to me by Almighty God, in and through his well beloved Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; and the hope of glory, which I daily experience through the Eternal Spirit, as my comforter and guide—I am induced to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute all I poſſibly can, towards the complete deſtruction and final overthrow of Anti-Chriſt's Kingdom; the plucking out of the ſnare of the devil thoſe who are taken captive by him at his will; preſerving the innocent from ſin, error and pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution; ſpreading the knowledge of the Lord over the whole world, and the teaching men to ſee what is the fellowſhip of the myſtery—that they may know the love of God; in ſuch a manner as to eſcape the pollutions, ſins and follies, of this preſent evil world, and may be accounted worthy to ſtand before the Son of Man. I am aware, that reducing the above reſolution to practice, will coſt me my reputation,<note n="*" place="bottom">I am not in connexion with any body of people, but am in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> and rebellion againſt Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty God. If there be any thing laudable in ſin, (as one might naturally ſuppoſe there is, it being ſo often committed
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:034372_0003_0FFC3346DE6D7590"/>
and ſo much delighted in) men ought not to be offended when they are reproved for it, or charged with committing it<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but if it is a diſhonour to God, and a diſgrace to human nature, let them be aſhamed to commit it, and they will not be reproached by being openly expoſed. But what if the earth be moved? The Lord ſitteth above the water-floods, and remaineth a King forever. Who art thou? O great mountain! A plain! Being therefore regardleſs of conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences relative to myſelf, and knowing the terror of the Lord, and the dreadful and unhappy ſtate of the wicked, I think it my moſt bounden and indiſpenſible duty, while I am in the body, to ſtir up your minds by way of remembrance. Leſt your ſtrict attention to worldly gain, ſenſual pleaſures and earthly delights, ſhould cauſe you totally to loſe ſight of eternal and heavenly things; and in conſideration of the worth and value of your immortal ſouls, the joys to which you are redeemed, and the danger you are in of being damned, I uſe great plainneſs of ſpeech, that if poſſible, I may be inſtrumental of provoking you to emulation, or of deterring you from living in the practice of any known ſin; that you may be led to conſider your way, and to turn your feet unto God's teſtimonies; that you may be led to conſider you are wrong before it is too late to be ſet right; and alſo, that your blood may not be found on me, through neglect of warning, and admoniſhing you faithfully as from the Lord, of your im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending danger, and the infallible certainty of your utter ruin, deſtruction and miſery, if you perſevere in ſinning againſt Almighty God, and in running counter to his divine commands. In conſequence whereof, I renounce the world, together with its vain pomp and glory; and alſo the empty honours, illegal profits, unjuſt emoluments, deceitful plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures and vain delights ariſing from it; being fully convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by reaſon and experience, that they cannot be admitted without diſpleaſing God, injuring mankind, and deſtroying the immortal ſoul. And he who does not contribute all he poſſibly can towards advancing God's glory, in promoting the preſent and future happineſs and ſalvation of mankind, is a diſhoneſt, deceived and worthleſs character. How wretchedly ignorant, and at the ſame time blind to his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="V" facs="unknown:034372_0004_0FFC33454EF43388"/>
and eternal intereſts, muſt he be who vainly ſuppoſes that it is not now required of men to live, as did the prophets and apoſtles, of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt. And who, for the ſake of being eſteemed among men as a peaceable citizen, will out of mere charity, ſo called, refuſe to reprove his neighbour; and, by tacitly conniving at his ſin, error and folly, ſuffers him to live and die in his ſins, and finally to ſink into perdition.</p>
            <p>THE following Appeal being levelled at the root of ſin, and ſiniſter motives, will not, it is probable, meet the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation but of a few; and as plays, novels, romances, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fane ſongs, &amp;c. engroſs the attention of moſt, whatever would conduce to the reformation of their hearts and lives, will be neglected, as things of an indifferent nature, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently unworthy their notice and attention. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I ſhall hereby juſtify the ways of God to men, through witneſſing in God's behalf to ſinners, that he wills not their deſtruction: and alſo, that he proclaims himſelf to be the Lord Jehovah, God, merciful and gracious, pardoning ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity, tranſgreſſion and ſin; and that he endues with power from on high, all thoſe who ſeek him, to keep his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, by not only reproving ſin and folly, but alſo by living ſuperior to whatever is contrary to God's moſt holy law, or offenſive to his Divine Majeſty. And as I deſire that my good may not be evil ſpoken of, I have written the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſheets by way of an Appeal, which I hope will be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a bleſſing to every ſerious and attentive read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; that all may be merciful, as they hope to obtain mercy from the Lord. A work of this nature has for ſome time paſt been deeply impreſſed on my mind, and I have been led to think that I could not die in peace if I did not carry it into execution. And let it be noted, (whatever may have been ſaid to the contrary by malicious and deſigning charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters) that I have ſuch an entire averſion to War, that if the ſlaves could obtain their liberty by it, I would, if poſſible, diſſuade them from it. The kingdom which I contend for is not of this world. Do you not diſcern this? If it was, the world would approve of me, for the world loveth its
<pb n="VI" facs="unknown:034372_0005_0FFC334265A50DF0"/>
own; but now the world hateth me becauſe I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eſtify againſt it that its ways are evil. "Away with ſuch a fellow, it is not fit that he ſhould live."</p>
            <p>I ENTREAT you by all that is great, good, holy, and ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, that you examine yourſelves and prepare for death and judgment, for when I have printed and delivered this to you, I ſhall be clear of your blood—I ſhall trouble you no more for ever! I hope you will not take offence at the plainneſs I have uſed in the following ſheets. Believe me, Sirs, I am no duplex, I do nothing under a cloak, but openly and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didly expreſs my ſentiments, ſimply without any degree of guile or mental reſervation whatever, Would not a lawyer merit cenſure from mankind, if he ſhould prove unfaithful to his client through bribery? or a phyſician fall into diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pute if he neglected the radical cure of his patient, rather than put him to pain? But what is the loſs of an eſtate, or the death of the body, compared with the loſs of heaven and the death of the ſoul? O Sirs! what would you think of me if I ſhould cry peace, peace, when God hath not ſpoken peace to your immortal ſouls? Would you not ſay, at the great and final audit, here is the wretch who ſoothed us in our ſins, who ſought not us but ours; who connived at our damnation; who, under the pretence of catching us with guile, has left us ſecure in the devil's net? But what more abundantly aggravates our miſery is, that we muſt behold this deceiver forever in hell. O Sirs! this is not a random no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or a mere "enthuſiaſtic revery," ariſing from a diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered brain; but truth and conſiſtency, matured by time, and deep meditation! I would have done you this labour of love much ſooner if my circumſtances had been adequate to it, or if I could have prevailed on any printer to print it; for all men ſeek their own, and not the things which are Jeſus Chriſt's; and if they can accumulate worldly gain, they are regardleſs of the immortal part, they have no notion of ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificing a leſs for a greater good. O Lord, lift thou up the light of thy countenance upon us! but do not riches make to themſelves wings and fly away as an eagle towards hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven? Is not the preſent failure amongſt the merchants a proof
<pb n="VII" facs="unknown:034372_0006_0FFC33402C03BB10"/>
of it? See their large and extenſive commerce in one hour, or in a very ſhort ſpace, brought to nought! Behold, your cities are burnt with fire! and a variety of other afflictions which are as ſo many loud calls from God to ſinners, to amend their ways, and to ſeek happineſs in God alone; to lay up treaſure in heaven, where true joys are to be found; where Chriſt ſitteth at the right hand of God, who will render to every man according to his works. O ye unhappy beings! I am ſorry to ſee you expreſs ſuch a rooted and fixed enmity to religion, and religious characters in general; and at me in particular, becauſe I entreat you to ſerve the Lord and ſave your ſouls, and to do to all men as you would they ſhould do to you, on change of circumſtances! Another day will teach you how inconſiſtently you have acted. May the Lord grant it may be done before it is too late to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pent! The Lord knoweth that I earneſtly deſire and pray that you may be happy in God through Chriſt. I would willingly undergo the greateſt hardſhips, could I be rendered inſtrumental of prevailing with you ſeriouſly to conſider the importance of living and dying. I have not the leaſt degree of enmity againſt any man; but from the very ground of my heart, freely forgive thoſe who have injured me, and would gladly embrace the firſt opportunity to do them good.</p>

As Chriſt our Saviour died for all, (the Greek word <hi>Koſmoon,</hi> John iii. 16. ſignifies, 'all who par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the nature in which he ſuffered') he hath command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his goſpel to be preached to all, ſaying—Go ye into all the world, and preach the goſpel to every creature—Go and <hi>Matheteuſate</hi> make diſciples (not slaves) of all nations—Go, proclaim liberty to the captives.

Permit me to expoſtulate with you on this painful and diſtreſſing ſubject.

(Acts 17.) That we are all the offspring of God—That the ſoul of the ſlave is of the ſame intrinſic value as the ſoul of the maſter. All ſouls are mine, ſays Jehovah. Have they then not an equal right with others, to the privileges of the goſpel, and to all other rights and privileges belonging to a free nation, under certain limita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and reſtrictions? If any of them ſhould prefer liberty to ſlavery, do either the laws of God, or the nature of the conſtitution, authorize you to exact more from them than you firſt advanced when you purchaſed them? (allowing a legal ſtated hire, together with the intereſt of your money, &amp;c.) It is certain that neither the laws of God, or the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the conſtitution, authorize you to do otherwiſe by them. Does God eſteem men merely for their worldly pomp and grandeur? The rich man, mentioned in the goſpel, evinceth the contrary. He was clothed in purple and fine linen, and fared ſumptuouſly every day; but through making a miſerable and wretched choice in life, experienced a moſt diſtreſſing and ſuitable change at death. He exchanged all his glory, for what? for a winding ſheet of ſire! In hell he lifted up his eyes, being in torments. Reader, will this be thy caſe? So ſure as there is a God it will, if thou liveſt and dieſt in an open violation of God's law. Time is ſhort and life very uncertain.

I ſpeak as to wiſe men, judge ye what I ſay! From whence came they? They were brought to this continent by a people called Chriſtians. Was it done with or without their conſent? Was it with the view to inſtruct them in the knowledge and love of God, our Saviour the Lord Jeſus Chriſt?—(He who doth evil that good may come, his damna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is juſt.) It was done without their conſent, and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs without any intention of inſtructing them in our Lord's moſt holy religion. Is it not evil, in the firſt inſtance, as it violates all the tender ties of nature, ſeparating what God has joined, and making thoſe twain whom he hath made one fleſh? Is it not a manifeſt breach of God's divine com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand? Gen. chap. ii. v. 24. Therefore ſhall a man leave his father and his mother, and ſhall cleave to his wife, and they ſhall be one fleſh.—In the aforementioned chapter we are informed, that the ſabbath and marriage were two ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances

inſtituted in innocency; the former for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church, the latter for the preſervation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind. It is ſaid by Matt. xix. 4. 5. that it was God himſelf who ſaid here, a man muſt leave all his relations to cleave to his wife; and, I think it appears from verſe 23. they are the words of Adam in God's name, laying down this law to all his poſterity. The virtue and bonds of a divine ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance are ſtronger even than thoſe of nature. You ſay, they were in bondage prior to their being brought to this continent? Admitting they were, this is no argument in ſupport of its perpetuity, as it is contrary to the rights of man the nature of the conſtitution, and alſo to the goſpel law which law not only commands us to love our neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours as ourſelves, but alſo to do good to our enemies, and to do to all men as we would they ſhould do unto us, on change of circumſtances. Hear the words of our Lord: Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do unto you, do ye even ſo to them; for this is the law and the prophets.—I appeal to your own conſciences in the ſight of God: Would you that men of another nation ſhould come and violently take from you, your wives, huſbands or children, leaving you to grieve, la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and mourn, without hope of being comforted? or would you be taken with theſe from your native reſidence to ſome foreign land, and there to be confined to drag out a miſerable and wretched life, kept ſhut up in the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found ignorance of God, and when you would make an ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort towards ſeeking and ſerving God, your overſeer ſhould confiſcate your books to the flames, ſentence you to a ſevere caſtigation, for attempting to look over the walls of igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance, and leave your ſouls to periſh (in the flames of hell for aught he cares) for lack of knowledge, leaving no ſtone unturned, reducing every effort to practice, to render, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, your ſtate more abject, and to make you the more effec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual and ſervile dupes to his caprice and to the tyrannic deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>potiſm of your mercileſs owners, without any ſtimulus to la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour but the whip, hard fare, and perpetual ſlavery for ſelves and families; and not content with thus depriving you of your rights, they purſue you with the malevolence of fiends, and on the ſlightest off<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="4 letters">

You would not. But you have, and are now, treating others in the aforementioned manner. Is it not then infallibly certain that you are violators of God's moſt holy law, and deſpiſers of what his holy prophets have ſpoken and written in his name? If you perſevere in your oppoſition to Almighty God, and refuſe to amend your ways, to put away from you the evil of your doings; unleſs you ceaſe to do evil and learn to do well; ſeek judgment, relieve the oppreſſed, &amp;c. to tremble when ye hear theſe awful paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages of holy writ, viz. What meaſure ye mete, it ſhall be meaſured to you again—Behold ye deſpiſers and wonder and periſh!—He who deſpiſed Moſes' law died without mercy—He ſhall have judgment without mercy who hath ſhewed no mercy. And, when ye ſhall hear the awfully tremendous voice of Jehovah God, ſaying, ariſe ye dead and come to judgment, to intreat ſome kind rock, ſome lovely mountain, to fall on you and hide you from his flaming wrath, and from his avenging frown. Are not highwaymen honourable men compared with men-ſtealers? Men-ſtealers are in ſcripture ranked with the vileſt characters. See 1 Tim. i. v. 10. The law is made for the lawleſs and diſobedient, for the ungodly, and for ſinners, for unholy and profane, for murderers of fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers and mothers, for men-ſlayers, for whore-mongers, for them that defile themſelves with mankind, (i. e. ſodomites) for men-ſtealers, for liars, for perjured perſons, and if there be any other thing that is contrary to ſound doctrine. O man, where art thou? Art thou not in the gall of bitterneſs and in the bonds of iniquity? Doſt thou already cry out, O wretched man that I am! joyful news! O eſcape for thy life!

If you deſire to ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance God's glory in the ſalvation of mankind, introduce the goſpel in Africa, and no longer connive at or publicly abet the villainous practice of the ſlave trade with it. How can you expect mercy from the Algerines if you ſhew none to the Africans? But alas! no temporal gain would ariſe from introducing the goſpel among them; and where gain is deified, nothing but it is worthy our attention; but as it is a falſe God, the love of it is the root of all evil, and inſtead of elevating its votaries to the ſummit of true happineſs, drowns them in ſin, and in eternal perdition; and yet it is a God notwithſtanding, which a very great majority of mankind profoundly worſhip, or they would not violate the laws of Jehovah, and deprive men of their natural and acquired rights to accumulate it; but, that the Africans were impoſed on you by people of another nation, that you did not bring them from their native land, ſeems altogether out of the queſtion.

Do they not act then, however wicked they may be, as if they think that vengeance is the Lord's, and that he will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pay it, in not doing to you as you would do to them, on change of circumſtances? But you ſay, they are the accurſed ſeed of Ham, and therefore ought to be in bondage. It is ſaid, Gen. ix. 5. Curſed be Canaan, a ſervant of ſervants ſhall he be unto his brethren.

But, when they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented and turned unto the Lord, they were reſtored to God's favour, and to equal privileges with their brethren. It is obſervable, that by quoting this ſcripture you acknowledge them to be your brethren, and thereby condemn your own procedure as illegal, for neither Jewiſh or Chriſtian laws ſubject any one, much leſs a brother, to perpetual ſlavery; and as the text expreſsly mentions, to their brethren, you are equally culpable if you acknowledge them not.

of mankind, viz. the devil? Thou doſt.—Does not ſatan, the father of lies, practice the ſame deceitful and accurſed art? Does he not know, if ſinners ſaw the danger of living in ſin, and alſo the privilege of ſerving God, that they would deſert his ſervice, that they would renounce the former and embrace the latter? He does; or at leaſt is apprehenſive of it; and therefore works with mighty energy on their hearts, vailing and blinding their minds, leſt the glorious goſpel of Chriſt, who is the image of God, ſhould ſhine into them, and they ſhould be ſaved. You charge the ſlaves of poſſeſſing en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious and malevolent diſpoſitions, that they are mere eye ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants, &amp;c. If you were taken from your native land to ſome foreign nation, to live forever in ſlavery, and kept as ignorant of God as poſſible, would not ſuch a conduct create a bitter and laſting enmity in your breaſt, againſt ſuch vile bloody, and unfeeling miſcreants as theſe? And wouldſt thou not perpetuate its memory by inculcating the ſame in thy offspring? Reaſon ſays thou wouldſt. Thou ſayeſt, that thy ſlaves will not accept of liberty; but why not? Probably thou tendereſt them liberty at ſuch a diſadvantage that they cannot embrace it, ſeeing no way whereby they can procure the neceſſaries of life. The air is the bird's ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, yet after long confinement in a cage, becomes blind to its natural right. The Iſraelites, after long ſervitude, ſunk into a low and abject ſtate, even beneath the dignity of men, ſo as to murmur againſt Moſes their temporary mediator; and preferred Egyptian bondage to that liberty which God ſaw to be their privilege, and had called them to the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of.

If we minutely examine the internal ſtate of ſlavery, it diſcloſes to us a ſcene of the moſt horrid nature, attended with the moſt alarming conſequences, viz. the owner carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on illicit commerce with the female ſlave, by which he entails ſlavery on his own offspring, and deprives it of its na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural right.

the ruin and deſtruction of her miſtreſs; and having recourſe to ſome pernicious and baneful corroſive, or in a more pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meditated and ſudden manner, uſhers in her untimely death. Do they not often poiſon one another; and do not the own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers connive at it, either through a ſervile fear of being mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered themſelves, (as a great gentleman ſaid to me, "we know not when we lie down at night but our throats may be cut ere the morning,") or through fear of loſing the ſlave who has perpetrated the wicked deed. Is not the owner, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, in a more wretched and ſervile ſtate than the ſlave? He is. As his procedure is wrong, he does not reſt ſecure beneath the ſhadow of the Almighty, neither do the angels of God encamp around his habitation. Lo! this is the man who taketh not God for his ſtrength, but truſteth in the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of his riches, and ſtrengtheneth himſelf in his wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, for "he knoweth not but his throat may be cut ere the morning." O moſt wretched and diſtreſſing ſtate this! O ſin how deceitful is thy gain, and how faſcinating are thy charms, that rationals by thee are diveſted of their rationality, and live in miſery to be more abundantly miſerable! O what a diſgrace to human nature, diſhonour to God, hatred to Chriſt, deſpite to the ſpirit of grace, deſtruction to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and injury to others, is done by incorrigible and aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned ſinners! Neither are they alarmed at the judgments of God, which have not been a few. In the firſt place, the rice was deſtroyed by the freſhets: theſe have been ſucceeded by two tremendous fires in the city, and the fires by the peſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, which ſwept away a very great number; but as theſe can be accounted for by natural cauſes, the hand of God is not ſeen in them; therefore, becauſe ſentence againſt an evil work is not executed ſpeedily, therefore the heart of the ſons of men is fully ſet in them to do evil. You add, that you have "miniſters enough already, and ſuch as do not cry down ſlavery, the ball-room, play-houſe, billiard-table, &amp;c. as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of ſo pernicious a kind as I repreſent them to be." Is not the reaſon obvious? It is. They either receive large ſalaries, which are a very great temptation to them, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nive at the faſhionable vices of the age, to ſubmit to the mere cant of the day, and to ſee no evil in whatever comports with
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:034372_0018_0FFC33251EF2BEA8"/>
their preſent lucrative ſtation; or they frequent the ſame places, and do the ſame things with their deceived auditors. Some of them it is certain, not only hold ſlaves (contrary to the ſtation of true Levites and miniſters of the New Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,) but at the ſame time are either afraid, aſhamed, (or think it will not comport with their continuing to be the dupes of their avarice and ambition,) to inſtruct them in the knowledge of our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt. Does not this plainly evince, that they are only nominal, not real miniſters of Jeſus Chriſt? It does: unleſs it can be proved that religion is not in ſubſtance what it was ſeventeen hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred years ago. Is it not evident that they are fallen beneath the dignity of men, and much more of Chriſtian miniſters? For the ſcriptures enjoin miniſters to feed the Church of God, which he has purchaſed with his own blood. O ye miniſters! How will you anſwer it to God, for ſuffering <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>heſe weak brethren (for you call them brethren) to periſh for whom Chriſt died? And inſtead of making converts of thoſe to whom you preach, to the religion of Jeſus Chriſt, make them tenfold more the children of hell, by your evil example, than it is probable they otherwiſe would have been. Do you not neglect to reprove them ſharply that they may be found in the faith, and thereby ſuffer ſin upon them, and alſo confirm them in it, by acting contrary to your profeſſion? Is this a time for miniſters to be abſorbed in the buſineſs of this world, in buying, ſelling, and getting gain; holding a vaſt number of ſlaves ſhut up in ignorance; living as beaſts before the Lord, without either food or ſeeder? O ye miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters! is this walking as Chriſt walked? It is not. Unto the wicked, faith God, wherefore doſt thou preach my laws? Whereas thou hateſt to be reformed.—For the Lord's ſake, your own ſouls ſake, and for the ſake of others, amend your ways, or reſign your important ſtation; give full proof of your miniſtry in future, or the Lord will come upon you at a time when you expect him not, and at an hour when you look not for him, and cut you aſunder, and appoint you your portion with the hypocrites! Do you not profeſs to believe that you were moved by the Holy Ghoſt to take upon you the work of the miniſtry? You do. But where are the

ſouls you have been inſtrumental of turning to the Lord? Are they not to be found? What is the cauſe? Is it not that you have been moved by an unholy ſpirit to neglect your duty; and inſtead of teaching the people to abſtain from the very appearance of evil, and to ſtand aloof from balls, plays, billiards, cards, horſe-races, &amp;c. as pernicious and deſtructive things, you ſanction them by your preſence, and thereby en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage men in the way to deſtruction. Let ſhame and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion cover your faces, that you have ſo highly diſhonoured God, degraded yourſelves, and injured others, in bringing a ſtain on the moſt holy religion of the bleſſed Jeſus, by being ſeen at any of the above places, as you have thereby cauſed the enemies of religion and God, to blaſpheme, ſuppoſing that religion is a cunningly deviſed fable, and that gain is godlineſs. Was it ever known that any was gathered into the fold or flock of Chriſt at a play-houſe? No! an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible proof that players are not of God; for our Lord faith, He that gathereth not with me, ſcattereth abroad! and this ſaying is verified both in players, and in their auditors, as the more they repeat and hear plays, &amp;c. the leſs deſire they have to hear ſermons, and to ſeek the ſalvation of their ſouls. And with reſpect to the innocency of balls, ſuffice it to ſay, that heathens were more diſcreet than to admit of la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies and gentlemen dancing together. Cicero ſays, <hi>Nemo ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brius ſaltat</hi>—no modeſt man danceth. Chryſoſt. ſays, <hi>Ubi eſt ſaltatis the eſt Diabolus</hi>—where dancing is, there the devil is. Let it then be remembered by theſe male, and female, triflers with God, that a dance cauſed the head of John the Baptiſt to be taken off, and that every dancer at beſt is a murderer of precious dear-bought time. But you have taken offence at my preaching in the public market! Is it contrary to ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to preach abroad? It is not.

I endeavoured to procure the old Baptiſt Church <hi>(pro tem.)</hi> but did not ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, it being hired previous to my application; neither could I obtain liberty to preach in the French Church, though I would have given ample payment, and alſo ſufficient ſecurity to reſign whenever their miniſter ſhould arrive.—Relative to

But did you not in ſome recent adver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſements, ſolicit the inhabitants of other ſtates to migrate to this ſtate for the "enjoyment of greater privileges?" and alſo that you protected "every kind of religion?" You did.—It appears then by your mode of expreſſion, that you would protect and defend their perſons in the free exerciſe of their religious worſhip. But how does this comport with your treatment of me, (as it is well known that Methodiſts from the beginning preached aloud) unleſs you mean by protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that you will carefully lodge them in the guard-houſe? But intendant E—ds profeſſeth a greater degree of ſanctity than ſome other perſons do, though it is evident that profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is not poſſeſſion, or he would not diſperſe the ſlaves, and alſo the free blacks, whenever he is informed of their being aſſembled to pray and to praiſe God. Intendant E—ds it ſeems, has offered to join all his influence to ruin me, and to deſtroy my wife's ſchool: but why would he do this?<note n="*" place="bottom">Did you not appoint the miniſters their province—Did you not openly declare that they ought not to interfere in ſecular matters; that the cure of ſouls was ſufficient for them to attend to? You did.—This ſuppoſes that ſouls are diſeaſed. But is it cuſtomary for the patient to preſcribe to the phyſician? I think not.—How comes it to paſs then that you, after appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the miniſters their province, undertake to direct them in what manner they ſhall apply their medicine! And to whom they ſhall, and to whom they ſhall not apply it? Pray what do you mean by this conduct? Is it that you will have no miniſters but ſuch as will ſuffer themſelves to be the mere dupes and tools of your caprice and humour? You may find ſome greedy dogs who can never have enough, who will ſubmit to you; but true miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Jeſus Chriſt will not, they have more regard for your ſouls than to flatter and deceive you. Is it reaſonable to ſuppoſe, that men who have been commiſſioned from the high court of heaven, to preach the everlaſting goſpel to every creature, will aſk your permiſſion, when, where, how, and to whom they ſhall preach it? It is not. For the importance of their ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is by far ſuperior to that of a king; and if they walk as Chriſt walked, ſeeking the intereſt of the Redeemer's kingdom, they are the ſalt of the earth; but thoſe who ſeek the honour which cometh of men, who are afraid to declare to the people openly and publicly, that unleſs they depart from all ſin and iniquity, and live a life devoted to God, they will periſh, are unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the name of miniſters. It appears from 2 Cor. chap. 5. that God has committed unto his true and faithful miniſters the miniſtry of reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. How very important then is their office, and how laudable their un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaking. How pleaſant and delightful would their tidings be to you if you would exerciſe reaſon, and humbly and calmly wait on God, until he has filled you with that ſweet heaven-born peace through Chriſt, which they make mention of. Language and expreſſion fail to ſet forth the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comparable worth and dignity of the Lamb of God, who taketh away the ſin of the world, and the innate happineſs and permanent ſatisfaction enjoyed by all his true and faithful followers. Has not the Apoſtle Paul commanded men to pray every where, lifting up holy hands to God without wrath and doubting? He has. And was he not guided and directed by the ſpirit of God in what he has enjoined us? He was. I aſk then, by what authority do you forbid men to pray every where, or at leaſt in their own houſes? Is this true liberty or the quinteſſence of popery? Is this man's natural right? Will long prayers, long ſermons, and a feigned ſanctity, juſtify you in oppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the order of God? Be not deceived, God is not mocked, for what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever ſeed a man ſoweth that ſhall he alſo reap. How can you make it appear to be conſiſtent even with heathen honeſty, much leſs with Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, to forbid the free blacks, &amp;c. to aſſemble together, to pray, and ſing praiſes to Almighty God?

Do not the free blacks, &amp;c. pay taxes, and alſo diſcharge all other duties and obligations impoſed on them, equally with other men? They do. Why then were they denied the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of purchaſing the liberty, to ſue for their rights, and at the ſame time ſeverely threatened, if they ſhould attempt to aſk it in future—or why may they not aſſemble together, to worſhip God without moleſtation? Is it ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther good ſenſe or good policy to deny them this privilege? Will you not, by limiting them in this reſpect, cauſe them to break forth, and burſt their bonds? See ye to it. Does not the above ariſe from ignorance of God and divine things? I think ſo. For Mr. R—ge, of Short-ſtreet, came near my window and curſed me, when I was at prayer! and on a certain evening I went to the Methodiſt Church to hear the Rev. Dr. Coke preach, when the Clerk of the Old Church came into the houſe, about half drunk, and ſaid, he would ſend the miniſter with all the damned Methodiſts to damnation, &amp;c. I preſume that the common plea whereupon many ground their argument to ſupport the Juſtneſs of ſlavery, (viz that through this mean many of them have been converted to Chriſtianity) is a mere ſubterfuge; for as the ſlaves' converſion was not their primary motive, however God may have overruled it for the ſlaves' good, the merchandizer in human blood is condemned never<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theleſs. (He who doth evil that good may come, his damnation is juſt.) And how much more ſo when he does it with an evil deſign.

It is not believing right only that makes us differ from the devil, but doing right. Chriſt went about doing good, ſeeking to ſave the loſt; but ſatan, as a roaring lion, goeth about ſeeking whom he may devour: the devil, is orthodox in faith, but deſtitute of love; and were you as orthodox as ſatan in the faith, and not imitators of Chriſt in love, you are not of God, but of the wicked one.

What colour of excuſe have you for the contempt with which you treat this part of our ſpecies? that contrary to the laws of God and man, you refuſe to put them upon the common foot of humanity?

And it is evident you do all you can to cut them off from the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pects of happineſs in the other world, as well as in this, and deny them the means (as far as in you lieth) of attaining it. Are you republicans? God pity you! I would rather be found in the place of an **** than in yours, if you die as you live; and what hope is there but that you will die ſo? You aſk, is ſlave-holding a ſoul-damning ſin? Let the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures decide this queſtion. 1 Cor. vi. 9. Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: neither fornicators, nor idolators, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extorti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oners ſhall inherit the kingdom of God. Is not ſlave-holding both an unrighteous and unjuſt thing? The hope of unjuſt men periſheth. Prov. xi. 7. Is it not pregnant with injuſtice, extortion, covetouſneſs and theft? I think ſo. It is then infallibly certain (as the ſcriptures cannot be broken) there is no alternative. You muſt either decline it, or be excluded the kingdom of God; except they prefer living with you in bondage to being liberated, then you are free from that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation. Abraham's ſervants enjoyed religious privileges equally with his own ſon. They were not trained up in ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance of God, but taught to ſerve and obey him. Teach your ſlaves to do likewiſe. Would it not be adviſeable to weigh in the balance of juſtice and equity, the preſent abject and ſervile ſtate of the poor deſpiſed and oppreſſed Africans? Admitting (as you ſay) that local circumſtances neceſſitate you to hold them, if they are neceſſary in order to your ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port, do they not merit from you much better treatment and attention than they generally meet with? It is certain they do. Slavery may be neceſſary to the ſupport of luxury and extravagance, but not to the ſupport of frugal and abſtemious
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:034372_0024_0FFC331694486200"/>
living, which every Chriſtian ought to be contented with. Godlineſs with contentment is great gain, for we brought nothing into this world, and it is certain we can carry nothing out; but where godlineſs is wanting, there is an aching void in the ſoul, which (though many things are ſubſtituted in its ſtead) nothing can ſupply. Hence the covetous man trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bleth his own houſe, is a flat idolator, deſtroyeth his own ſoul, and aims (at leaſt) at the deſtruction of others, and final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſinks into perdition. As you employ overſeers to ſuperin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend your buſineſs, and to inſiſt on the ſlaves doing whatever he ſhall inſiſt on as a duty incumbent on them to their own<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers. Why do you not employ a good man who, at the ſame time might inſtruct them in their duty to God? Ought not your miniſters to viſit them, to ſee that every man has his own wife, and every woman her own huſband? To join them together in holy matrimony. For marriage is honour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in all<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the bed undefiled, but whore-mongers and adulterers God will judge; whether they are high, or low, rich or poor, white or black, bond or free. For without holineſs ſhall no man ſee his face in glory. Some families whom I much eſteem, and from whom I have received many favours, have frequently complained of the diſhoneſty and ingratitude of their ſlaves, in rendering them contempt, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and diſobedience, in return for their indulgence and kindneſs to them. This I know to be truth, and am very ſorry they are thus perplexed and troubled, inſtead of being obeyed, honoured, and eſteemed by their ſervants; as I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve they are better done by than they could do for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves if they were liberated. (It is true there are very few ſuch inſtances!) But it ſeems that nothing will atone for their being deprived of their natural right. Nature pleads for its own, and will not (in the general) be content without it, though you would give many gifts. The very idea of li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation is irkſome to the rational ſoul. As the Almighty has given us juſt and holy laws, and has capacitated and qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified us to keep them; and at the ſame time, freedom and liberty to obey or diſobey, and to theſe has annexed gracious promiſes and dreadful threatenings; the former to encourage and ſtimulate to love and obedience, the latter to awe and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:034372_0025_0FFC33146825E4A0"/>
deter us from ſin and diſobedience. And that we might not live beneath our privileges on the one hand, and remain igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of our dangers and diſadvantages on the other, hath (through Chriſt) given the Holy Ghoſt, and a preached goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. Would it not be laudable to imitate, and copy, after Jehovah God? The apoſtle ſays, be ye imitators of God as dear children; which, in the firſt inſtance, would lead us to put into execution the Declaration of Independance, viz. that liberty is every man's natural and unalienable right; and to inſtruct all men in the truth, making them acquainted with the laws of God, and with the laws of their country; that whenever they violate them, they may not do it through ignorance; that being convicted of tranſgreſſion, they may be juſtly puniſhed; and, in conſequence of their good de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portment and well regulated life and converſation, they may be equally eſteemed in this world, and alſo in the world to come receive the crown of glory that fadeth not away. I fear you have not conſidered the dangerous conſequences of cow-ſkin or forced obedience, or you would immediately de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline it. The only proper method whereby to know what men are, is to treat them as free agents; and whoever fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows not this rule, is either ignorant or diſhoneſt; for where there is no ſtimulous to obedience but ignorance, caſtigation, menaces and abuſive language, it forebodes a moſt melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly, alarming and dire cataſtrophe! Here I might (to il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate this awful and tremendous ſcene) begin with Egypt, where literature firſt flouriſhed; and from thence proceed to the Chaldean, Grecian and Roman nations, and even down to individuals; and then inquire, what has been the cauſe of theſe changes, and of the great devaſtation and ruin wrought among them; the anſwer would be ſin! What is ſin? Sin is <hi>anomia!</hi> A tranſgreſſion of the law. And as no perſon is under the neceſſity of tranſgreſſing God's holy law, it plainly evinceth, that their condemnation for ſin is juſt, and that their deſtruction is entirely of themſelves; and what has been may be again; however ſecure we may think ourſelves our ſins will find us out.

And has not God ſaid, that righteouſneſs ſhall cover the face of the earth? It then behoves all thoſe who would wiſh to eſcape the wrath of God, to reduce their utmoſt efforts to practice, to eſtabliſh it in the earth. Let it be remembered, that if we provoke the Almighty to come down to remove the evils which he hath commanded us to remove, and to eſtabliſh that juſtice and equity among men which he hath commanded us to eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh, we may expect to meet with no other treatment from him than our baſe, wicked, and ungodly conduct has me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rited, viz. death, and without repentance (which will then be uncertain) damnation.

Thus will the Almighty viſit the ſins of wicked pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents on their wicked offspring. Is not the curſe reverſed? Are not the owners become the ſervants of ſervants? In a ſpiritual ſenſe they are; for they fear leſt the ſlaves ſhould either poiſon them or cut their throats. Thus the head is become the tail, according to the ſaying of Moſes in Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy. This city has already received a deadly wound, which is judged will take ten years in healing; but without a ſpeedy reformation, who can ſay it will ever be healed?

O repent and lead a holy life! O be intreated, for Chriſt's ſake, for your ſoul's ſake, to eſcape the damnation of hell, and to enjoy eternal felicity! But, do you hate to be reformed? Will you defy Jehovah? Are you regardleſs of what will be the end of ſinning? Will you treaſure up wrath againſt the day of wrath, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from heaven, with his mighty angels, in flaming fire, taking vengeance on them who know not God, and who have not obeyed the goſpel of our Lord

Where their worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched? Where the ſmoke of their torments aſcendeth up for ever and ever? What, will you chuſe death in the error of your life, and dwell with devils and damned ſpirits in eternal fire? Be drenched with the ſulphurous fumes of the deep abyſs? What, will you who are redeemed by Jeſus Chriſt, become the reproach of devils? Through denying him, by wicked works, will you dare him to deny you, before his Father and the holy an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels? O God! can theſe dead ſinners live? Lord thou knoweſt! O Lord, breathe upon theſe ſlain by ſin and ſatan, that they may live! Do you not live, as if you were created for yourſelves, inſtead of being created for God's ſervice and the good of mankind? Have you not already turned Jeſus Chriſt out of doors? You have, in denying his divinity and contemning his worſhip. And have you not done this becauſe your manner of living contradicts his holy mandates, as if this would be a ſufficient excuſe for you at that great and awful period, when the ſecrets of all hearts ſhall be diſcloſed? But let it be remembered, that there is no other name given among men, whereby we can be ſaved, but by Jeſus! There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore if you live and die without an intereſt in his merits, you wilfully exclude yourſelves from the glory and happineſs of heaven, and plunge yourſelves into the miſeries and torments of hell. Alas! did not but ſee your ſins, the nearneſs of death and judgment, the lake of fire and brimſtone, and the fiends who attend you, what loud cries and bitter wailings would you make! What, can you eat, drink and talk, on the verge of hell, without any concern for your immortal ſoul? Is the ſong of the drunkard your delight? O thou neglector of ſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation! God is angry with thee, condemns thee to be damn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and may the next moment ſlay and ſend thee to hell. Art thou bold on the brink of endleſs burnings?

But to prevent thy deſtruction, and that thou mayeſt not deſpair of ſalvation, when thou con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidereſt thy dangerous ſtate and condition, and what a bitter enemy thou haſt been againſt God, thy neighbour and thyſelf, the Lord hath ſaid, As I live I will not the death of the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, but that he repent, return and live—When the wicked man turneth away from the wickedneſs that he hath com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, and doth that which is lawful and right, he ſhall ſave his ſoul alive—Come unto me all ye that are weary and heavy laden, and I will give you reſt. The doubt is not whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther God will have mercy on you, but whether you will em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace it in his way and on his own plan, viz. through Chriſt. O come to God, depending on the alone merits of his only begotten Son for preſent and future ſalvation! And reſt not ſatisfied until you know that you are accepted in and through the beloved Jeſus, until you know that you have redemption through his blood, the forgiveneſs of all your paſt ſins, and have received the Holy Ghoſt as your comforter and guide, and as the earneſt of your eternal inheritance—that following his guidance, and living a holy and ſpotleſs life, and being re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newed in righteouſneſs and in true holineſs, you may be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented faultleſs before the preſence of his glory with exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing joy, and receive the crown of life—the ſentence, Come ye bleſſed of my Father, and receive the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world; when the righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous will ſhine forth as the ſun in the firmament in the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of their father; where they will behold God in the perſon of Jeſus Chriſt, through the countleſs ages of eternity; ſinging praiſes to him who liveth forever and ever.

When the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels in flaming fire, taking vengeance on thoſe who know not God, and who obey not the goſpel of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and from the glory of his power, when he ſhall come to be glorified in his ſaints, and to be admired in all who believe, in that day.

If the report is true, are you not the man, who, living and dying in your preſent ſtate, ſhall never ſee the face of God with comfort? Can you adviſe men to leave their wives, and remain guiltleſs? No. For he who breaketh the leaſt commandment, and teacheth men ſo, whether by precept or example, the ſame ſhall be called leaſt, in the kingdom of heaven, that is, ſhall have no part therein. Can it poſſibly be, that you have wandered ſo far from the right way, as to adviſe a man to leave his wife? Is not your precept herein contrary to our Lord's precept? It is. For our Lord teaches that a man ſhall leave all his relations and cleave to his wife.—Can any whore-monger, adulterer, fornicator, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean perſon, covetous man, or idolator, enter the kingdom of heaven? No. What then will the end be of thoſe who adviſe men to put away their wives, and take other wives? While you thus act, is not your preaching an abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination to the Lord, and is not your prayer turned into ſin? Unto the wicked, ſays God, wherefore doſt thou preach my laws, whereas thou hateſt to be reformed? Thou art inexcuſable, O man! For, while thou teacheſt ſome from the pulpit not to ſin, thou adviſeſt others to leave their wives in thy private converſation with them, and hereby thou tempteſt them to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit ſin. Conſider, I pray thee, for a few moments, the importance of thy ſtation; and the mean, abject, and ſervile ſtate of the poor ſlave whom thou adviſeſt to leave his wife; and then contraſt the ſubject between a learned Doctor, who has had the advantages of a liberal and polite education, and an ignorant ſlave, who cannot utter a ſentence of Engliſh with any degree of propriety, and you will be led to ſee that you have great reaſon to be aſhamed before Almighty, God, that you have ſo much abuſed theſe great advantages, as to ſubject yourſelf to be thus expoſed, by there proof of a poor, abject slave. It is then infallibly certain, that great learning and ſuperior advantages only ſerve to make the poſſeſſor ſo much the more like ſatan, if he is hardened in ſin, and is not partaker of the Holy Ghoſt, or does not follow and attend to his dictates. Thus it was with the ſcribes of old, they deſtroyed their precept by their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample. Is not he who provides not for his own, eſpecially for thoſe of his own houſe, worſe than an infidel? And does not this proviſion, copiously conſidered, imply training them up in the way they ſhould go, in the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and admonition of the Lord? How then can you eſcape the wrath of God, which is revealed from heaven, againſt all unrighteouſneſs, for confining your slaves to your plantation, ſuffering them to live in ſin, and in ignorance, without teaching them to ſeek and ſerve the Lord, violating the Lord's day by ſervile labour, &amp;c. while you are in the houſe of God, taking the name of God in vain, by ſaying, Lord have mercy upon us, Chriſt have mercy upon us. when you do not the things which he commands you. And though you ſhould pay tithe of mint, aniſe, and cummin, you neglect the weightier matters of the law, judgment, mercy and faith. You reſemble thoſe blind guides who ſtrain out a gnat and ſwallow a camel. Thoſe who within are full of rapine and intemperance—thoſe who within are full of dead men's bones and all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs—thoſe who within are full of hypocriſy and iniquity.

What if you ſhould give all your goods to feed the poor, and your body to be burned and remain deſtitute of charity, divine love to God and man, what will it avail you at the laſt and great day, when robed in dreadful majeſty the Judge of all ſhall come?
