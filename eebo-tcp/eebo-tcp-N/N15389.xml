            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>SOLEMN and deeply affecting to the feeling mind is the preſent ſcene!—We here behold a truly pitiable object, one of our guilty race, who, left to the guidance of an uninſtructed mind; or rather to the uncontrouled in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the direful paſſions, malice and revenge, has per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petrated a crime which freezes the mind with horror.— She has been ſummoned before the Civil Tribunal; and, after a fair and impartial trial, was convicted of the crime for which ſhe is this day to ſuffer.</p>
            <p>The cry of innocent blood hath <hi>entered into the ears of the</hi> LORD <hi>of Sabaoth</hi>; but this day will ſilence its claims. — YES; in a few hours, will be executed the fatal, the tremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dous ſentence which puts a period to the life of one, who had never learned to live.—In the beginning of life, a <hi>murderer,</hi> Juſtice forbids that ſhe ſhould live out half her days: for—

               <hi>Whoſe ſheddeth Man's blood, by Man ſhall his blood be ſhed.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. 9.6.</note> This is the voice of Juſtice and of the GOD of Juſtice: There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore "<hi>a man that doth violence to the blood of any perſon, ſhall flee to the pit—let no man ſtay him.</hi>"<note n="‖" place="bottom">Prov. 28.17.</note>
            </p>
            <p>The preſent ſeaſon is all-important:—How ſhall I anſwer its claims?—On the one hand, the poor priſoner loudly claims every moment as her own: for that her laſt ſands are now falling, and that in a few hours ſhe muſt launch into that world whence there is no return.—On the other hand, are the intereſts of this numerous aſſembly of fellow-men, who are alſo ſoon, very ſoon to cloſe this mortal life; and the eternal ſtate of each be determined according to his preſent improvement of divine inſtruction.—And, how big with important in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is the melancholy event, of which we are this day to be witneſſes!—Principally then to my Auditory let the preſent opportunity be devoted.</p>
            <p>To this I the more readily conſent, from a conviction of the impracticability of adapting a Diſcourſe, upon this occaſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to the improvement of one who, until within a few weeks, was ignorant of the firſt principles of Religion; having been left to heatheniſh darkneſs in a Chriſtian land. Yes; my brethren, this poor priſoner, when committed to gaol, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have no higher principle than the pleaſure of gratifying her ungoverned paſſions.—And ſo far from having the fear of GOD before her eyes—<hi>O tell it not in Gath!</hi> —ſhe hath repeatedly declared to me, that ſhe did not know that there was a GOD, before ſhe was told it after her impriſonment.</p>
            <p>Are there any in this aſſembly whoſe conſciences reproach them with the ſame cruel inattention to <hi>their</hi> Children and Servants? Such are this day called to their duty in language which muſt pierce a Parent's heart. May every ſpectator of this day's painful ſcene, learn the importance of faithfulneſs in the relations of Parent and Maſter.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:019547_0005_0FABF95B36D5AC88"/>The melancholy event, which we are now called to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>template, ſpeaks to us in thunder from the Mercy-Seat.— Though wrath is kindled againſt us; yet HEAVEN addreſſes us as he did his choſen people: <hi>Be thou inſtructed, O Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem, leſt my ſoul depart from thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I may not enlarge in ſhewing the occaſion of this paſſage: —<hi>For this I ſay, brethren, the time is ſhort.—What thou doeſt, do quickly.</hi>—In a word therefore: this paſſage was delivered by the Prophet in the name of the LORD, at a time when Judah had almoſt filled up the mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of her iniquities, and exhauſted the patience of her GOD. In the verſe preceding our text we have her charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. <hi>As a fountain caſteth out her waters, ſo ſhe caſteth out her wickedneſs: violence and ſpoil is heard in her, before me continually is grief and wounds.</hi> Then follows our text: in which we behold the mercy and compaſſion of her GOD. Though he had <hi>ſent unto them all his ſervants the Prophets, ſaying, Obey my voice and I will be your GOD, and ye ſhall be my people. But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the counſels and imaginations of their evil heart.</hi> GOD, at length wearied with their incorrigibleneſs, is about to <hi>pour cut upon them the fury of his juſt indignation.</hi>—Yet, <hi>how ſhall I give thee up Ephraim!</hi>—Mercy interpoſeth and tenderly perſuades. <hi>Be thou inſtructed, O Jeruſalem, leſt my ſoul depart,</hi> or as the original more ſtrongly expreſſes it, <hi>be disjointed from thee.</hi> We haſten to apply this paſſage to the preſent occaſion: in doing which, let us</p>
            <p n="1">I. Attend particularly to the inſtruction which GOD, in righteous judgment, is this day calling us to receive.</p>
            <p n="2">II. Conſider the argument by which attention to this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction is here enforced.—<hi>Leſt my ſoul depart from thee.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But theſe means of inſtruction, without the ſpecial influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of divine grace, are of no avail:—For, the heart of the children of men being <hi>fully ſet in them to do evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> they hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken not, nor incline their ear.

            <p>But, when GOD ſpeaks in the thunders of <hi>Judgment; the people,</hi> if not left to a judicial blindneſs and hardneſs of heart, <hi>hear and fear and do no more ſuch wickedneſs. By thy Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> ſaid David, <hi>is thy ſervant warned: and in keeping of them there is great reward.</hi> The adverſe events of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, frequently, affect thoſe whom nothing elſe could affect. —Senſible objects gain attention, where an addreſs to the underſtanding will not be heard. The Senſes are an avenue by which there is an eaſy acceſs to the heart. When this is brought to eſpouſe the cauſe of virtue, the underſtanding is eaſily convinced.</p>
            <p>The melancholy event, of which we are this day to be witneſſes, conſidered with all its attendant circumſtances, addreſſes every tender feeling, and cannot fail to reach the heart.—Struck with horror at the bloody deed—Amazed at ſuch an inſtance of <hi>cruelty</hi> and <hi>revenge</hi> in one ſo young.— And every tender emotion of the ſoul awakened at beholding this early victim ſacrificed to Juſtice:—Will not every one preſent, with earneſtneſs enquire—Wherefore has our land been thus ſtained with a crime, which, with all its painful circumſtances, it has never known before? Wherefore are we called to this ſcene of woe?—<hi>What doth the LORD require of us?</hi>

            <p>Shameful and unpardonable, my brethren, is the almoſt univerſal neglect of family Inſtruction and Government. One of the truly unhappy conſequences of this neglect, we behold in the ignominious end of this poor girl who is now to pay the forfeit of life into the hands of juſtice. <hi>Be thou inſtructed, O Jeruſalem, leſt my ſoul depart from thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I reflect on the nature of the duties in which GOD is now inſtructing us, to which therefore we are now to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend; I could wiſh that the ſpeaker had been ſuch an one as "Paul the <hi>Aged,</hi>" rather than the Youth whom the requeſt of the priſoner has called to addreſs you upon this occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. But ſince this may not be, permit me, with that reſpect which is due to my auditory, in the warmth of love to my Country and the Souls of men, and with that fidelity which I owe to our great Maſter and LORD, to point out ſome of thoſe duties; to the diſcharge of which you are obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated as <hi>Parents</hi> and <hi>Maſters</hi>; and to the neglect of which the melancholy ſcene of this day is in a great meaſure to be charged.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Family Devotion, though a very unfaſhionable, is, however, a very important part of the duty of the Head of a family, if he would <hi>walk in his houſe with a perfect heart.</hi> —"Every houſe ſhould be a Bethel, and every maſter of a family, in his houſe, a prieſt of the MOST HIGH GOD." A daily <hi>reverential</hi> attendance upon this duty, early impreſſes the young mind with a ſenſe of the divine omnipreſence, and teacheth the fear of that GOD whoſe <hi>eyes are in every place.</hi> Shall the heathen, my brethren, guided by the dim light of Nature, bow down at their family altars; and ſhall the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies, in which the Sun of Righteouſneſs ſhines with the clear light of divine Revelation, pay no worſhip to the true

GOD?—Are there no family wants to be ſupplied? No family bleſſings to be acknowledged?—Or are we like Iſrael of old, "who ſat down to eat and drink and roſe up to play?" —"She did not know, ſaith GOD by his Prophet, that I gave her corn and wine and oil, and multiplied her ſilver and gold, which they prepared for Baal: Therefore will I return and take away my corn in the time thereof, and my wine in the ſeaſon thereof; and I will recover my wool and my flax given to cover her nakedneſs."<note n="‡" place="bottom">Hoſea 2.8, 9.</note>

            <p n="2">2. Children and Servants ſhould be early taught to read. This is an advantage which the children in a family generally enjoy. But are not our ſervants, my brethren, too often for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten? How few have the means of inſtruction? Moſt of thoſe who have, inſtead of being ſpurred to that applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, without which there can be no proficiency, are conſtantly interrupted by our many calls. At length ambition flags, and, being diſcouraged, they trifle away the little time allotted them. Their conſequent little progreſs is now imputed to a want of genius peculiar to their complexion.—Now, diſtinguiſhed from his brethren, and highly favoured will be that ſervant, who is not left, either to heatheniſh darkneſs in a <hi>Chriſtian land,</hi> or to ſpell out unaſſiſted the principles of Religion, and every truth which reſpects his eternal ſalvation. Hard is their lot!—Humanity drop a tear.—I would here anticipate an objection which may perhaps be made to the idea of <hi>duty</hi> in the relation of Maſters to Servants.</p>
            <p>Objection. Servants bought with our money are our abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute property: and may we not do as we will with our own?</p>
            <p>While he, who is not ſteeled to the feelings of a generous mind, bluſhes at this objection; I am not careful to anſwer in this matter. But, in a word;—they are not your own: for they <hi>are bought with a price.</hi> If you alienate them from his ſervice who hath <hi>bought them even with his own blood,</hi> the debt contracted on your part will, I fear, render you in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolvent,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:019547_0009_0FABF96E76A201F8"/>
and conſign you to that priſon whence there is no diſcharge <hi>'till thou haſt paid the uttermoſt farthing.</hi>—The blood of ſouls will be charged to your account.—Think well, —How will you diſcharge it?—I haſten to another part of the duty under conſideration.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Early inſtil the great principles of Religion and Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. —Thoſe under our care ſhould be taught that great firſt principle of Religion—<hi>There is a GOD.</hi>—As the young mind enlarges, it ſhould be made acquainted with the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Perfections of GOD. This will lead to explain and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force our obligations to him as our Creator, Preſerver and Redeemer. Did the Redeemer when on earth take little children into his arms and bleſs them? Can <hi>Chriſtians</hi> then forget to devote theirs to him who thus loved them?— Point them to their Saviour on the croſs, and let his agoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing death teach them the evil of ſin, and its dreadful puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The beauties of holineſs and its glorious rewards, are alſo to be ſet before them in language adapted to their capacities, and calculated to reach the heart.</p>
            <p>The beginning of our days is an important part of hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life.</p>
            <p>"Juſt as the twig is bent the Tree is inclin'd."</p>
            <p>The ſubſequent periods of life will take their ſtamp from that of childhood. Happy is it when the firſt impreſſions are in ſavour of virtue. To effect this there muſt <hi>be line upon line, and precept upon precept.</hi> The firſt openings of the mind are to be carefully watched; and every opportunity of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtilling that which is good, faithfully improved.</p>
            <p>Here, I am aware, will ſtart up that frightful ſpectre, <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice of education</hi>; with which ſome men appear panic-ſtruck. To deliver themſelves from this, they exert themſelves to the utmoſt: 'till at length, having effected their purpoſe, their lives ſhew that to be delivered from, what they call, the prejudice of education is, in other terms, to be diveſted of every virtuous and religious principle. Far be it, however, from any one to ſuppoſe that we ſhould have no higher ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:019547_0010_0FABF970722F6598"/>
for our principles in religion and virtue, than education. —A ſlender ſupport indeed!—No; my brethren, the mind properly cultivated will, when matured by age, know its own importance, and ſearch <hi>whether thoſe things are ſo</hi> which it had received as true.</p>
            <p>That the mind of man, in the firſt buddings of reaſon, diſcovers an ardent thirſt for knowledge, and, incapable of determining the quality of what is offered, drinks in with avidity what is firſt preſented is a truth which will not be diſputed.—Since then the mind cannot be kept a blank until brought to maturity: Thoſe, who do not chuſe to give vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous principles the firſt poſſeſſion, muſt, unavoidably give this advantage to thoſe which are vicious. That Society may long be ſecured againſt the influence of minds thus early formed to the ſervice of the enemy of all Righteouſneſs, will be the prayer of every friend to virtue and his country.— But to purſue our ſubject:</p>
            <p>With the knowledge of GOD is connected that of our duty to Him, our Neighbour and ourſelves. Every duty ſhould be clearly explained and the diſcharge of it ſtrictly enjoined. Thus did the Father of the faithful approve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf faithful in all his houſe:—GOD himſelf bearing witneſs for him. <hi>I know Abraham,</hi> ſaid he, <hi>that he will command his children, and his houſhold after him, and they ſhall keep the way of the LORD.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Gen. 18.19.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="4">4. To private inſtruction is to be added the public in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions of the Houſe of GOD. <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>loveth the gates of Zion more than all the dwellings of Jacob.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Pſal. 87.2.</note> Here thoſe committed to our care behold the worſhip and order of the Goſpel, with its Ordinances and Inſtructions:—hear the word of ſalvation at the mouth of the <hi>Meſſenger of the</hi> LORD <hi>of Hoſts</hi>:—and learn that <hi>fear of the LORD which is the beginning of wiſdom, and that knowledge of the holy which is underſtanding.</hi> For this purpoſe was the direction given, Deut. 31.12, 13.
<q>Gather the people together, men and women and CHILDREN, and thy ſtranger that is within thy gates, that they may hear, and that they may learn, and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:019547_0011_0FABF979B4CB32A0"/>
fear the LORD your GOD, and obſerve to do all the words of this Law;—and that their CHILDREN, which have not known any thing, may hear and learn to fear the LORD your GOD.</q>
            </p>
            <p>When we attend with our children upon the public inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the great object in view ſhould be to train them up in the nurture and admonition of the LORD.—This, however, will not be the weightier matter of the law where the Pulpit is proſtituted to ſerve the intereſts of a party—But, the faithful Miniſter of that Religion which breathes Charity and good-will to man, will not diſtinguiſh himſelf in the ſacred deſk, by uttering ſevere invectives or artful inſinuations a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the Miniſters and Churches of other denominations.— When this takes place, one ſays, <hi>I am of Paul</hi>; another, <hi>I am of Apollos.</hi>—But my brethren, let it be your concern that you and your children <hi>may be of CHRIST.</hi> Again,</p>
            <p n="5">5. The beginnings of an amiable diſpoſition are to be cultivated. This ſuppoſes that we ſtudy the diſpoſitions of thoſe under our care: that we may be able to diſtinguiſh the good from the bad. The tempers of mankind are vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and require as different modes of cultivation as the various ſoils under the hand of the diſcerning huſbandman. The tender benevolent diſpoſition is already fitted for the ſeed. Haſten therefore to ſcatter the good ſeed, and 'ere long it ſhall <hi>yield a joyful crop.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt dawnings of that which is amiable and praiſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy ſhould be encouraged.—Particularly: that ingenuous ſincerity which gives the impreſs of gold to every other virtue:—an unſhaken attachment to truth:—a modeſt and reſpectful deportment towards Superiors: an obliging atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to Equals: an eaſy condeſcention to Inferiors: and that compaſſion for thoſe in diſtreſs which leads to imitate him who <hi>went about doing good.</hi> A mind, thus liberally endowed, ſhould not be left unguarded againſt that by which <hi>many ſtrong men have been ſlain.</hi> Therefore thoſe under our care ſhould be early inſpired with ſentiments which will raiſe them ſuperior to irregular deſires, and <hi>fleſhly luſts which war againſt
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:019547_0012_0FABF97B56E8F998"/>

               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Prov. 7.27.</note>—This leads to obſerve,</p>
            <p n="6">6. The beginnings of a vicious diſpoſition ſhould receive an early and effectual check. Vices are like thoſe weeds which, having once taken root, are with the utmoſt diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty deſtroyed. A bad natural diſpoſition if not early ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued will, 'ere long, bring forth nothing but briars and thorns, to pierce a parent's heart with many ſorrows. To prevent this too often unhappy caſe: the command of a parent ſhould enforce the motives to virtue. Thus did David com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand Solomon, when inſtructing him in the way of wiſdom. <hi>And thou, Solomon my ſon, know thou the GOD of thy Father, and ſerve him with a perfect heart and with a willing mind; for the LORD ſearcheth all hearts, and underſtandeth all the imaginations of the thoughts; if thou ſeek him, he will be found of thee; but if thou forſake him he will caſt thee off for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Chron. 28.9.</note> But the language of parental <hi>authority</hi> in all caſes ſhould be the laſt reſource. When the yearnings of parental tenderneſs in the mild and gentle language of perſuaſion prove ineffectual, then the deciſive tone of authority becomes neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. <hi>Withold not correction from the child,</hi> ſaith Solomon, <hi>for if thou beateſt him with the rod he ſhall not die.—Thou ſhalt beat him with the rod and ſhalt deliver his ſoul from hell.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Prov. 23.13, 14.</note> Here, however, exceſſive ſeverity becomes equally prejudicial with an exceſs of indulgence: for "human nature is like the ſpring of an engine, which, being forcibly preſſed, upon the firſt liberty returns back with ſo much the greater violence." Happy is he who knows the golden mean; who can temper the ſeverity of reproof with the tenderneſs of a parent.</p>
            <p>A due proportion ſhould ever be obſerved between the crime and the puniſhment. While lighter offences are paſſed with a gentle rebuke; more heinous crimes call for greater ſeverity. A light reproof in the latter caſe would countenance rather than correct the offence: and, let me add, the parent or maſter would not be guiltleſs. Heavy is the charge brought
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:019547_0013_0FABF97C072D3820"/>
by Heaven againſt Eli, for his indulgence to his ſons, when they made themſelves vile, and wounded Religion by their impiety. For their aggravated wickedneſs they receive this gentle rebuke from their father:—<hi>Why do ye ſuch things: for I hear of your evil dealings by all this people; Nay, my ſons: for it is no good report that I hear: you make the LORD's people to tranſgreſs.</hi>
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Sam. 2.23, 24.</note> This is conſtrued into a neglect on the part of the father; for which the rod of the Almighty came upon him and his houſe. <hi>For I have told him,</hi> ſaid the LORD to Samuel, <hi>that I will judge his houſe forever, for the iniquity which he knoweth: becauſe his ſons made themſelves vile and he reſtrained them not.</hi>
               <note n="§" place="bottom">1 Sam. 3.13.</note> We may not here point out very particularly where paren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal reſtraint is neceſſary. Every thing that ſavours of impiety or a contempt of GOD and his ſervice ſhould not be ſo much as named among children. <hi>But above all things,</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>James 5.12.</hi> But above all things, my brethren, ſwear not, &amp;c.</note> reſtrain them from that prophane abuſe of the ſacred name of GOD, with which the virtuous ear is, at this day, ſo often wounded. To effect this it may be ſufficient, having before taught them the fear of the LORD, to ſhew them how pitiable in the ſight of obſervers, is the character of that man who, without even the ſhadow of honour, pleaſure or profit in return, can wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tonly trifle with his Maker, and thus <hi>ſell his ſoul for nothing.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Further, parental reſtraint ſhould extend to every thing which is oppoſed to that <hi>good name which is better than pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious ointment.</hi>—Here I cannot but particularly mention thoſe ſervile vices, falſhood and diſhoneſty. Theſe diſcover a meanneſs of ſoul incompatible with the manly virtues.</p>

            </q>
            <p>To be juſt to ourſelves, our neighbour and our GOD, is the ſum of moral virtue: for <hi>he hath ſhewed thee, O man, what is good; and what doth the LORD require of thee, but to do juſtly, and to love mercy, and to walk humbly with thy GOD?</hi> 
               <note n="¶" place="bottom">Micah 6.8.</note>

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:019547_0014_0FABF97CB071DB00"/>The ſmalleſt deviation from the path of righteouſneſs will, even in early life, give a wound to reputation which will not be eaſily healed. To the conſideration I might add that of the numerous unhappy inſtances, in which the little <hi>pilferings</hi> of childhood paſſing unpuniſhed have ariſen to that height of wickedneſs which is to be puniſhed by the Judges; and thus the end is public infamy, or an ignominious death. Therefore it is of the laſt importance that children ſhould learn to conform every action to the golden rule of equity.— <hi>Whatſoever ye would that men ſhould do to you, do ye even ſo to them.</hi> This great law of benevolence and juſtice cannot be too early inculcated or too deeply impreſſed on the mind while tender.—But I have already been more particular than I intended.—</p>
            <p>Yet with the ſtriking inſtance before us of the truly melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly conſequences of furious and ungoverned paſſions, I may not paſs on without urging the abſolute neceſſity of a very early reſtraint upon theſe. When Anger, Malice and direful <hi>Revenge</hi> get poſſeſſion of the heart of man; he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes a monſter, an enemy to Society and fit only to her<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

In the heart of the furious and <hi>revengeful</hi> man.—<hi>O my ſoul, come not thou into his ſecret; unto his aſſembly, mine honour, be not thou united.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Enforce your inſtruction by your own <hi>example.</hi> It is a common though very juſt obſervation, that example goes before precept. Thoſe heads of families who indulge them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in furious paſſions,—intemperance,—falſhood,— diſhoneſty,—prophane ſwearing—or an impious contempt of God and Religion will be found, with reſpect to thoſe under their care, <hi>blind leaders of the blind.</hi> To theſe the words of the apoſtle, apply.—<hi>Thou therefore who teacheſt ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, teacheſt thou not thyſelf?</hi>

               <pb n="17" facs="unknown:019547_0015_0FABF97D71B0A078"/>8. Finally, Brethren, <hi>pray</hi> for your families. <hi>Except the LORD keep the City the watchman waketh but in vain.</hi>— Without the bleſſing of the kind Parent of the Univerſe; the anxious concern, faithful inſtruction and prudent govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of an affectionate parent will end in diſappointment and ſorrow. To the Father of mercies, therefore, who <hi>like as a father pitieth his children; pitieth them that fear him:</hi> apply earneſtly and with unceaſing ſupplication for the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of an affectionate and dutiful family.—Whether this be a bleſſing worth <hi>wreſtling</hi> for with the GOD of Jacob: ye who are parents beſt can tell.</p>
            <p>I muſt now haſten, remembering that <hi>the time is ſhort</hi> and with brevity,</p>
            <p>SECONDLY. Conſider the argument by which attention to divine inſtruction is enforced in the text.—<hi>Leſt my ſoul depart from thee.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>By this is to be underſtood, the withdrawing from a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a Family or an Individual the gracious preſence of that GOD, <hi>in whoſe hand it is to make great,</hi> and by whom <hi>the haughtineſs of man is bowed down.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus when a people favoured of the LORD will not hearken nor incline their ear to his inſtruction; their national bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings are accurſed from Heaven, and their pleaſures will be bitterneſs in the latter end. Though for a ſeaſon they may be proſpered, and riot in the bounties of Providence; yet let them not flatter themſelves with ſecurity, while that hand can reach them, which plucked down from the height of national dignity the peculiar people of the Moſt High. <hi>They are waxen fat,</hi> ſaid GOD by his Prophet, <hi>they ſhine: yea they overpaſs the deeds of the wicked: they judge not the Cauſe, the Cauſe of the fatherleſs, yet they proſper: and the right of the needy do they not judge. Shall I not viſit for theſe things<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſaith the LORD: Shall not my ſoul be avenged on ſuch a nation as this?</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">Jer. 5.28, 29.</note> Be thou inſtructed, O MY COUNTRY! leſt thy GOD depart from thee.</p>

               <pb n="18" facs="unknown:019547_0016_0FABF97E5F509DE8"/>But the preſent occaſion leads me to conſider the argument in the text, more particularly as it reſpects divine inſtruction addreſſed to families. The argument in this view implies, that, when Heads of families are inſtructed in their duty, if they refuſe and will not hear, the LORD will withdraw his preſence from them and write their deareſt bleſſings accurſed. For ſuch GOD hath his quiver full of arrows which will pierce them to the heart.</p>
            <p>Dutiful and obedient children are an <hi>heritage of the LORD.</hi> Iſaac was the obedient ſon of the father of the faithful: at whoſe command he yielded himſelf as a lamb to the ſlaughter. Faithful Eliezer of Damaſcus was the ſervant of Abraham who was faithful in all his houſe. Theſe are among the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſings of that man who is inſtructed out of the Law of the LORD. <hi>Bleſſed is the man that feareth the LORD, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth greatly in his commandments. His ſeed ſhall be mighty upon the earth: the generation of the upright ſhall be bleſſed. Wealth and riches ſhall be in his houſe: and his righteouſneſs endureth forever.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But thoſe, who, though they acknowledge the fear of the LORD, will not regard his inſtruction; being found unfaithful in their houſes; will realize the withdrawing of the divine pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence in the fate of an unfaithful Eli: to whom was fulfilled the following meſſage from the LORD. <hi>Them that honour me I will honour: and they that deſpiſe me ſhall be lightly eſteemed. Behold, the days come that I will cut off thine arm, and the arm of thy father's houſe; that there ſhall not be an old man in thine houſe. And the man of thine, whom I ſhall not cut off from mine altar, ſhall be to conſume thine eyes and to grieve thine heart: and all the increaſe of thine houſe ſhall die in the flower of their age.</hi>
               <note n="¶" place="bottom">1 Sam. 2.31, 33.</note> Theſe evils, I might add, are the natural conſequences of too great parental indulgence. Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petites and paſſions unreſtrained in childhood, become furious in youth; and enſure <hi>diſhonour, diſeaſe</hi> and an <hi>untimely</hi> death.

            <p>The happineſs of an affectionate parent depends much upon the conduct of his children.

            <p>It is indeed a part of parental duty to attend to the wants of a family and "provide things honeſt in the ſight of all men.".—<hi>If any provide not for his own, and eſpecially for thoſe of his own houſe, he hath denied the faith and is worſe than an infidel.</hi> This is the declaration of an inſpired Apoſtle.— But what do ye more than an infidel, if, in providing for your children and ſervants, your care be confined to their bodies while their <hi>Souls</hi> are left to ſtarve?—If your children aſk bread will you thus give them a ſtone? Suffer, fathers, this boldneſs of ſpeech:—if you condemn it I muſt appeal to a HIGHER TRIBUNAL.</p>
            <p>Do you love your children? O then, as you regard your own happineſs and theirs, guard them as the apple of your eye. While their minds are tender and open to every im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, leave them not unguarded to receive their firſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions from a corrupt heart and a degenerate world. Be aſſured, if you leave them uncontrouled to the government of their paſſions, and the almoſt irreſiſtible influence of ill exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple,—<hi>I ſpeak as to wiſe men; judge ye what I ſay,</hi>—they will ſoon come forth well verſed in all the myſteries of iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Then will they repay your fond indulgence, or rather cruel neglect, into your own boſoms. Will they render you the returns of filial obedience and ſincere affection?—To obey is a leſſon they were never taught. And as you never gave them any proofs of the affection of a parent; but on the contrary, "<hi>cruel like the Oſtriches in the wilderneſs,</hi>" left them expoſed to be trampled under foot by every paſſenger: you cannot expect that they will regard you with the warm affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a ſon.—O ye parents, why will you thus wring out to yourſelves the full cup of wormwood and gall?—Who
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:019547_0019_0FABF981D407CEC0"/>
hath bitterneſs?—Who hath woe?—Is it not he who hath a ſon that <hi>hearkeneth not to his father's inſtruction</hi> and <hi>deſpiſeth his mother when ſhe is old?</hi>—Is it not he who hath a ſon that being <hi>left to himſelf bringeth his mother to ſhame?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But if you are not yet alarmed for your helpleſs offspring; and are yet to be convinced of the dangers attending child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood and youth; go into our ſtreets and, if your hearts can endure, be witneſſes for yourſelves.—Behold on every ſide children unreſtrained practiſing iniquity <hi>with greedineſs.</hi> Not only thoſe vices which frequently attend meanneſs of birth and education, ſuch as theft and lying; but alſo thoſe, which ariſe from a total neglect of family government, mark the preſent riſing generation. Your own obſervation muſt determine the juſtice of this remark. It is indeed painful to obſerve child<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ren through a want of early education, poſſeſſing nothing amiable or praiſe-worthy; but on the contrary, devoted to guilty paſſions, and chuſing <hi>the way which leadeth to death.</hi> —They are malicious and revengeful and love contention. —But do they ſtop here?—Gladly for the honour of human nature and my Country would I now draw the veil. —But fidelity forbids.—Be aſtoniſhed, O ye heavens, and give ear O earth! <hi>A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in our land: and there are thoſe who love to have it ſo.</hi> Children that have but juſt learned to ſpeak are heard liſping forth horrid oaths and impious curſes. They probably would not have known that there is a GOD; had they not been taught to trifle with his Name, that Name which is <hi>great and terrible, for it is holy.</hi> And equally ignorant would they have been with reſpect to a future world; had they not learned to curſe their companions and, with impious boldneſs,
<q>damn their ſouls to hell.</q>
—But I tread on un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed ground.—I cannot proceed.— My ſoul ſhudders at the recollection of the horrid expreſſions of curſing and blaſphemy, with which the virtuous ear is ſo often pained.—I dare not repeat them.—Should I attempt it, it would but renew your pain: and I fear, leſt, like the "<hi>fretting leproſy,</hi>" its touch ſhould leave me unclean. —</p>

            <p>Men and Brethren,</p>
            <p>I beſeech you, in the name of the LORD, to conſider ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly the things of which you are this day witneſſes. We have here a ſtriking evidence of the depravity of human nature; that we are indeed <hi>tranſgreſſors from the womb.</hi> We here ſee the natural productions of a heart uncultivated and left to itſelf; that indeed, it <hi>is deceitful above all things and deſperately wicked.</hi> At one view we now behold the conſequences of the firſt apoſtacy, and the iſſue of actual tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion. Surely <hi>the way of tranſgreſſors is hard:</hi> for <hi>he that purſueth evil purſueth it to his own death.</hi> Let us there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore hear and fear and do no more wickedly. <hi>Let every ſoul be ſubject to the higher powers, for rulers are not a terror to good works, but to the evil. If thou do that which is evil be afraid</hi>; for ye ſee brethren <hi>that they bear not the ſword in vain; for they are the Miniſters of GOD, to execute wrath upon him that doth evil. Wherefore be ſubject, not only for wrath, but alſo for conſcience ſake.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Let us learn from what we now behold, that <hi>it is an evil and bitter thing to forſake the LORD our GOD.</hi> Doubtleſs the pity of every one preſent, is excited towards this criminal, thus in the beginning of life condemned to death, and now ſurrounded by the officers of juſtice, for execution. Indeed, that heart muſt be paſt feeling which can unmoved, be a witneſs to a ſcene like this. But, while we indulge a generous pity for a fellow-creature in diſtreſs, let us fear leſt we fall into a worſe condemnation, as criminals before the Tribunal of Heaven. For thus ſaith the faithful and true Witneſs; <hi>He that believeth not is condemned already.</hi>

unto the time of execution? So is the unbeliever faſt bound in the chains of ſin and fettered by his guilty paſſions unto the final, dreadful day of execution: that day in which <hi>he that made him will not have mercy on him, and he that formed him will ſhew him no favour,</hi> Let us therefore brethren, <hi>take heed leſt there be in any of us an evil heart of unbelief, in departing from the living GOD.

            <p>To the Priſoner.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Hannah,</hi> the time for you to die is come.—Yes; poor girl!—in about two hours, your eyes will be ſhut by death and you will not ſee the light of this ſun again forever.— This is the laſt time that you will ever hear my voice from this place: for you are now going where I cannot ſee you; inſtruct you; or even pray for you.—You are going where you will find that thoſe things which I have told you are true. —Yes, you will ſoon ſee that there is a great GOD who loveth goodneſs and good people; but <hi>is angry with the wicked every day,</hi> and will puniſh forever thoſe whoſe ſins are not pardoned before they die.—You will ſoon ſee that Saviour who came into this world to ſave ſinners. You will one day ſtand before his Judgment-Seat, and if you do not, this day, truly repent of your wickedneſs and truſt in him alone for mercy; he will pronounce againſt you a ſentence infinitely more dreadful than that which has already been pronounced.—</p>
            <p>You are now going to be hanged until you are dead: after that you will know, better than I can tell you, either the joys of Heaven, or the miſeries—the miſeries—O my ſoul!—the miſeries of hell. Oh <hi>Hannah!</hi> repent of your
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:019547_0025_0FABF98E8EAF3760"/>
wickedneſs: this is the only time.—Be aſhamed before GOD of your crimes.—Think how cruel you was, in not ſparing the little girl, when ſhe cried to you for mercy.— Don't you wiſh for mercy from GOD?—You have told me that you do.—If he is not more merciful than you, your ſoul cannot be ſaved. Remember, if he has mercy upon you, it will be from his own goodneſs; not from any good thing which he ſees in you:—He ſees nothing in you but wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs,—a poor wicked creature covered with the innocent blood of a helpleſs child crying to you for mercy and you would ſhew no mercy.—<hi>Repent</hi> and <hi>believe</hi> in CHRIST, he is the only Saviour: if you are ſaved it will be for his ſake alone. Pray earneſtly to GOD that he would pity your ignorance and have mercy upon you for CHRIST's ſake.— Think, <hi>Hannah,</hi> of what you have to do—haſten, or it will be too late—your time is ſhort,—poor girl,—how much is to be done and how little time have you to do it in? —Your day is already far ſpent, and, O dreadful thought! the night of death is cloſe at hand.—The guard, the officers of juſtice with all the dreadful attendants of your death, are now around you waiting for me to ſtop.—I muſt ſay no more.—Poor girl!—farewell.—May GOD in his abundant goodneſs give you repentance unto life, and have mercy on your ſoul.

            <head>APPENDIX.</head>
            <p>AS the Public may wiſh to be informed more particularly reſpecting the criminal, <hi>Hannah Ocuiſh,</hi> than they have yet been: we have collected the following particulars, which it may not be improper to annex as an appendix to the preceding diſcourſe.</p>
            <p>She was born at <hi>Groton.</hi>—Early in life ſhe diſcovered the maliciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and cruelty of her diſpoſition: as appears from the following fact, which was repreſented in evidence before the grand-jury. When about ſix years old, ſhe with a brother about two years older than herſelf, meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a little girl at a diſtance from the neighbourhood, they endeavoured to get away her clothes and a gold necklace which ſhe had on.—After beating the child until they had almoſt killed her, they ſtripped her, and diſputing about the diviſion of the clothes the child recovered, and getting away came home, covered with blood. This affair was immediately ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined into, and the ſelect-men of the town concluded to bind them both out.</p>
            <p>Their mother, who is one of the <hi>Pequot</hi> tribe of indians, is an aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned creature, much addicted to the vice of drunkenneſs.—She, it ſeems, not liking to have the girl bound out; brought her away and left her at a houſe, about three miles from the city of <hi>New-London,</hi> promiſing to return in a few days and take her away again. But ſhe did not return 'till after ſeveral months, when urging the family to keep her longer they at length conſented.—She continued in this family until ſhe was appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended for the crime, for which ſhe was executed.</p>
            <p>Her conduct, as appeared in evidence before the honorable Superior Court was marked with almoſt every thing bad. Theft and lying were her common vices. To theſe were added a maliciouſneſs of diſpoſition which made the children in the neighbourhood much afraid of her. She had a degree of artful cunning and ſagacity beyond many of her years. —In ſhort, her mind wanted to be properly inſtructed, and her diſpoſition to be corrected.</p>
            <p>We now come to the particulars of the horrid crime for which ſhe ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered.</p>
            <p>On the 21ſt of July, 1786, at about 10 o'clock in the morning, the body of the murdered child was found in the public road leading from <hi>New-London</hi>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:019547_0027_0FABF98F9366F6F8"/>
to <hi>Norwich,</hi> lying on its face near to a wall. Its head was covered with ſtones, and a number lay upon its back and arms. Upon examining the body the ſkull appeared to be fractured; the arms and face much bruiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and the prints of finger-nails were very deep on the throat.—The neighbourhood were immediately engaged in making ſearch and enquiry for the murderer. The criminal made uſe of her uſual art, to prevent ſuſpicion.—She ſaid that ſhe ſaw four boys in her miſtreſs's garden near where the child was found: that ſhe called to them for being in the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den and ſoon after heard the wall fall down. After ſearching and enquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for theſe boys to no effect, ſuſpicions became ſtrong that ſhe was the guilty perſon. On the 22d, ſhe was cloſely queſtioned, but repeatedly denied that ſhe was guilty. She was then carried to the houſe where the body lay, and, being again charged with the crime, burſt into tears and confeſſed that ſhe killed her; ſaying if ſhe could be forgiven ſhe would never do ſo again. The particulars which ſhe then gave, and which ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in the courſe of the trial were as follow.</p>
            <p>On the morning of the 21ſt, ſhe went to a brook which is near her miſtreſs's houſe, to get a pail of water:—when at the brook, ſhe ſaw the little girl come into the road, going to ſchool. She immediately haſtened home with the water, and ſetting it down at the door, ran acroſs the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to overtake the child:—when near her, the criminal jumped over the wall and called to her: offering her a piece of calicoe which ſhe then held in her hand. The child coming to her, ſhe ſtruck her on the head with a ſtone which ſhe had taken up for the purpoſe, and repeating the blows the child cried out, <q>Oh, if you keep beating me ſo I ſhall die.</q> She continued the blows until the child lay ſtill. But after a few moments, ſeeing that ſhe ſtirred; ſhe took her by the throat and choaked her 'till ſhe was dead. Being aſked why ſhe laid ſtones upon the child. She ſaid; it was to make people think that the wall fell upon her and killed her.— Upon being aſked why ſhe killed her: ſhe ſaid that ſhe had intended giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her a whipping becauſe ſhe had complained of her in ſtrawberry time (about five weeks before) for taking away her ſtrawberries.</p>
            <p>Such an inſtance of deliberate revenge and cruelty in one ſo young, has ſcarcely a parallel in any civilized country.</p>
            <p>When the criminal was firſt committed to priſon ſhe appeared uneaſy with her ſituation; but after a little time ſeemed to be quite contented and happy.—She would divert herſelf with the children that went to ſee her, and frequently would make very ſhrewd turns upon thoſe perſons who made ſevere remarks upon her.</p>
            <p>When arraigned at the bar, ſhe, at the direction of her council, plead "not guilty." During her trial ſhe appeared entirely unconcerned.— After the verdict was brought in, and ſhe was carried back to the priſon; a perſon viſited her and told her what muſt now be her puniſhment; and that ſhe muſt prepare for death, and for another world: ſhe ſeemed greatly affected, and continued in tears moſt of the day.—After this ſhe ſeemed as unconcerned as before, and was very backward in converſing with the perſon who had thus alarmed her fears. It appeared that ſome perſons had been there afterwards and encouraged her with telling her that ſhe would not be hung.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="31" facs="unknown:019547_0028_0FABF99089A02838"/>When ſhe was brought to the bar to receive ſentence of death, her ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity and unconcern aſtoniſhed every one. While that benevolent ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs which diſtinguiſhes his honor the Chief Juſtice, almoſt prevented utterance, and the ſpectators could not refrain from tears; the priſoner alone appeared ſcarcely to attend.</p>
            <p>About a fortnight before her execution ſhe appeared to realize her dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, and was more concerned for herſelf. She continued nearly in the ſame ſtate until the Monday night before her execution: when ſhe appeared greatly affected; ſaying, that ſhe was diſtreſſed for her ſoul. She conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued in tears moſt of Tueſday, and Wedneſday which was the day of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution. At the place of execution ſhe ſaid very little—appeared greatly afraid, and ſeemed to want ſomebody to help her.—After a prayer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dapted to her unhappy ſituation, was offered to HEAVEN, ſhe thanked the ſheriff for his kindneſs to her, and then paſſed into that ſtate which <hi>never</hi> ends.</p>
