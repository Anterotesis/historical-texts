            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

However it does not fall to every ones ſhare to have the Books cited; and ſome of them are rarely to be ſeen in <hi>New-England:</hi> beſides, the Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating many things thus together, will ſave both time and pains to ſuch as have Libraries, and want Leiſure to ſearch them.</p>

            <p>How near theſe great &amp; laſt Changes of the Church and World are, with the exact time &amp; order wherein they are to be Accompliſhed, are Matters too high for our Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Chronologers: Whatever they may pretend to, the Arrows are beyond them: there is no fixing the certain Time for the Events of any Propheſy before the Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: (at the End it ſhall Speak, <hi>Habak. ii. 3.</hi>)</p>

               <hi>Brightman</hi> upon the Place obſerves, theſe words in the <hi>Revelations</hi> have a far other Meaning than thoſe in <hi>Ezekiel:</hi> and upon the laſt words in the verſe, <hi>viz.</hi> and <hi>Souls</hi> of Men ſays, <q>THE HOLY GHOST ſeems to have changed the Conſtruction of the words of ſet purpoſe, that He might note out the Difference between this Commodity, and all the other, eſpecially thoſe of the <hi>Bodies;</hi> for theſe words <hi>and Souls,</hi> are not put in the Genitive Caſe, as it is clear in the <hi>Greek</hi> text, but in the Accuſative, as we have tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated it in the <hi>Latin;</hi> whereby it is ſignified that there is a diverſe, and diſtinct Conſideration made in the Place, of <hi>Souls</hi> and <hi>Bodies.</hi>
               </q> Thus that Learned Man.</p>
            <p>This remarkable Diſtinction makes it the more ſtrange, that ſuch of our Proteſtant Expoſitors, as underſtand by the word <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>Beſides, I doubt upon Examination, even the Proteſtants will be found as much concerned in the Merchandize of Slaves, as thoſe of the Romiſh Religion, and ſo it can't be a Characteriſtic of the Apoſtate Church, which (as has been noted) is the great Deſign of the Context.</p>
            <p>I have already obſerved, That Mr. <hi>Brightman</hi> reads the word <gap reason="foreign">

Some Learned Men have thought, that the wretched Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection and Vaſſalage of the Princes and People in <hi>Europe,</hi> to the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> eſpecially in the Ages preceding the Reformation, when the Popes treated them like <hi>Slaves,</hi> is here intended.</p>
            <p>Others again are of Opinion, That by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, we may very well underſtand, the Merchandize made by the Romiſh Church of the Bodies of Men <hi>while alive,</hi> in thoſe Rigorous and unnatural Chaſtiſings of the Body, by Shirts of Mail, Haircloth, Whippings, and other Bodily Penances: which, tho' enjoyned &amp; practiſed under pretence of ſpiritual Mortification, and for the good of the Soul; yet upon oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion may be diſpenſed with, and are commuted into Money, or ſome other Emolument to the Church, and ſo turned into <hi>Merchandize.</hi> But <hi>Veritas rei,</hi> &amp; <hi>veritas loci,</hi> are two different things. The Queſtion is not what the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in general ſignifies, or how it may be rendred in other Places; but what the Meaning of it is in this Invoice of the Merchandize of Myſtical Babylon.</p>
            <p>And with Reverence to our Engliſh Tranſlators, and the other Venerable Authors before-mentioned, I am of Opinion, That by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, in the Text, we ought to underſtand the DEAD BODIES of Men: To ſupport which, beſides what has been already mentioned tending that way, I would offer the following Conſiderations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> It is well known, That the Romiſh Church for ſeveral Ages, has made Merchandize as well of the

               <hi>Dead Bodies,</hi> as the <hi>ſeparate Souls</hi> of Men: (as is proved in the following Eſſay.) Now if we are to ſuppoſe the HOLY GHOST in this Place, (as our Proteſtant Expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitors grant) Deſigns by the word <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap>, the Merchandize which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> makes of <hi>ſeparate Souls;</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly it is as reaſonable to think, That by the word <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap>, He ſhould point out another Branch of their vile Trade, <hi>viz.</hi> that of the <hi>Dead Bodies</hi> of Men.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly,</hi> The manifeſt Diſtinction in the Original, and ſo between the <hi>two Species</hi> of Merchandize obſerved by Mr. <hi>Brightman,</hi> will be moſt effectually preſerved by this Interpretation of the word <gap reason="foreign">

That the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> not only carries on this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lawful Trade, but openly Juſtifies and Avows it, in De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance of the <hi>Word</hi> of GOD, and the Canons of ſeveral <hi>Eccleſiatical Councils</hi> to the contrary, is notorious and cannot be denied. <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> one of their great Champions ſays in expreſs words, <q>That the <hi>Relicks</hi> of the Saints, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Bones, Aſhes,</hi> &amp;c. are to be Adored: altho, not with the ſame kird of Worſhip, as the Spirits of Saints; yet with more than Humane or Civil Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, <hi>viz.</hi> with Religious Supplication, Rites, Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtation, Thurification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

            <p>It is a ſorrowful thing, and even a Reproach to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, to find by Eccleſiaſtical Hiſtory, the Primitive Fathers, many of them at leaſt, advancing ſo much towards this Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſtition, by their Exoeſſive Veneration for the Memory and <hi>Sepulthres</hi> of Martyrs and Saints, their too great Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulity of what was reported of Miracles being wrought and Viſions ſeen at their <hi>Graws:</hi> Even St. <hi>Auſtin</hi> himſelf has theſe words, <q>Who dare deny that GOD, by ſacred <hi>Aſhes, Bones,</hi> and other <hi>Relicks</hi> of the Saints, works the ſame ſort of Miracles, as were performed by <hi>Pauls</hi> Hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief, <hi>Eliſhas</hi> dead Body, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

The Cloud indeed was then no bigger then a Mans hand, but in a few Ages it covered the Heavens with blakneſs. One of the firſt Steps to this Superſtition, was the <hi>Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crating</hi> the <hi>Places</hi> where the Martyrs, or any eminent Saints were <hi>buried,</hi> calling them <hi>Altars.</hi> At theſe Altars, the Chriſtians kept their Vigils; thither in the day time, eſpecially on ſet days, they would repair to offer their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, as they called them; that is Prayers, making Vows, Oblations, and even Celebrating the Sacraments: But this
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:003413_0020_100353ECC9C315A0"/>piece of Devotion being found chargeable &amp; troubleſome eſpecially for thoſe who lived at a diſtance; they proceeded, to tranſlate the Bodies of Martyrs &amp; Saints, at leaſt ſuch as they called ſo, to their Temples, or built Churches for them. The Emperor <hi>Conſtantine,</hi> in his devout Zeal, began this Practice: for <hi>Jerom</hi> tells us, that he tranſported the <hi>Bodies</hi> of <hi>Andrew, Luke</hi> and <hi>Timothy</hi> to <hi>Conſtantinople:</hi> And the Empreſs <hi>Conſtantia,</hi> as <hi>Agrippa</hi> before-named tells us, ſent to <hi>Gregory</hi> the 1ſt. for the Head of St. <hi>Paul,</hi> or ſome part of his Body, to be Interred at St. <hi>Pauls</hi> Church in <hi>Conſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinople.</hi> And the common People following theſe Examples, would not ſuffer the Bones of the Primitive Saints to reſt in their Graves, but took them up, and carried them from Place to Place: and when they built &amp; dedicated a Church to any of the Apoſtles, primitive Biſhops, or other Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs, if it were poſſible they would get either the entire Body, or at leaſt ſome Member to be there Interr'd with great ſolemnity, whatever it coſt them: for the Original Owners &amp; Poſſeſſors at length grew ſo Cunning, as to ſet a good Price upon theſe <gap reason="foreign">

This brought on thoſe Superſtitious PILGRIMAGES to <hi>Jeruſalem, Rome, Conſtantinople,</hi> and other Holy Places, as they called them. Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> in his Hiſtory before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned tells us, <q>That there were believed to be a <hi>hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred thouſand</hi> Pilgrims at one time on a Jubilce at the Tomb of <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> in <hi>Canterbury.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>The 5th Council of <hi>Carthage,</hi> Canon the 4th. appointed expreſly, <q>That no Altar ſhould be built, withous the Relicks of ſome Martyr.</q> And the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> did in expreſs terms decree, <q>Such Pilgrimages to the Sepulchers, and in Memory of Saints, to ask and obtain their Help, are Godly and Religious, and to be much uſed of Chriſtians:</q> and no wonder ſince it brought in ſo much Gain to the Crafts-men, for they took care to manage theſe Pilgrimages to great Advantage many ways, to mention but three.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> the <hi>Offerings</hi> made to the Shrine, and in Honour of the <gap reason="foreign">

               </gap> of the Place were very Valuable. <hi>The Author but now named,</hi> in the ſame Book, acquaints us, That the Annual Oblations at <hi>Beckets</hi> Tomb amounted to near a <hi>thouſand Pounds</hi> Sterling; and that King <hi>Lewis</hi> the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth of <hi>France</hi> came over in Pilgrimage to it, and offered a Stone reckoned to be the richeſt in <hi>Europe:</hi> So that this Shrine grew to be of ineſtimable value; for when it came to be broken by <hi>Henry</hi> the VIII. the Gold of it was ſo heavy that it filled two Cheſts, which took eight Men a piece to carry them out of the Church.</p>

               <hi>Secondly,</hi> There being as has been obſerved upon theſe Solemnities, a great Concourſe of People, (ſuppoſed to come from a principle of Devotion) the Prieſts had a fine Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to put off their <hi>Purgatory Maſſes,</hi> and other Popiſh Wares, and even ſorced the deluded Votaries to buy them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> And to mention no more; upon theſe Occaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons alſo theſe Sharpers would ask <hi>Alms</hi> for the <hi>Poor,</hi> and then take it for <hi>themſelves,</hi> under the Notion of their own Vow of perpetual Poverty. For theſe Reaſons this Superſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion became ſuch a <hi>Noli me tangere,</hi> that Perſons have been griev'ouſly perſecuted, and even to death, for only declaring againſt this Folly.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Fox</hi> in his <hi>Martyrology</hi> gives many inſtances of this kind. One <hi>William Sweeting</hi> put to death, for ſaying to his Wiſe, <hi>That it would be better for her to tarry at home, and attend upon her Buſineſs, than to go upon Pilgrimages. Iſabel Merwyn</hi> was alſo put to death for ſaying, <hi>She would go no more upon Pilgrimages while ſhe lived, for all Saints</hi> (ſays ſhe) <hi>are in Heaven:</hi> with many others, as I find'em cited by <hi>Willet</hi> in his <hi>Synopſis Papiſmi.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I my ſelf being at <hi>Coruns</hi> in <hi>Spain</hi> in the year 1697. ſam more than an <hi>hundred Men and Women</hi> paſſing thro' that City on a Pilgrimage, to the Shrine of ſome noted Romiſh Saint, at <hi>two or three hundred Miles</hi> diſtance from their own Habitation.</p>
            <p>There is ſcarce a Church of any note or figure in all the Romiſh Countries, but pretends to have, and at proper ſeaſons
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:003413_0023_100353FDAB6321C8"/>to expoſe the <hi>Relicks</hi> of ſome Saint; and the Council of <hi>Milan</hi> preſcribe certain Rites to be obſerved in ſhowing thoſe Relicks, in order to excite the Faithful to the Vene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of them.</p>
            <p>We have already noted, that the pretence of Miracles wrought, and Viſions ſeen at the <hi>Sepulchres</hi> of the Saints, was one thing that gave riſe to this Superſtition, and was alledged by, the Romiſh Church in their Juſtification: But leaſt theſe forged Miracles, or lying Wonders ſhould Multiply too much, the Council of <hi>Milan</hi> Enact, <q>That there be no new Miracles Publiſhed or Admitted, no new Relicks received, without the Knowledge &amp; Appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of the <hi>Biſhop;</hi> And the Council of <hi>Lateran</hi> ſays, It muſt be with the Authority and Approbation of the <hi>Roman Pontiff.</hi>
               </q> That theſe <hi>Relicks,</hi> or the moſt of them were Counterfeit and Forged, is moſt certain, and numbers of them have been derected and found to be the vileſt of Impoſtures. This is a Fact ſo Notorious, that many learned well diſpoſed Men of their own Church, have been aſhamed of it: And therefore Pope <hi>Innocent</hi> the third, Decrees, That <q>Prelates ſhould not ſuffer thoſe who come to their Churches to Worſhip, to be deceived with falſe and feigned Relicks, as the Cuſtom has been in divers Places for Lucre ſake.</q> But alas! this Decree ſignified little; for Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> in his <hi>Travels</hi> tells us, That the Popes of the two laſt Centuries have Sprung ſuch a Mine of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks in the CATAGOMBS of <hi>Rome,</hi> as will ſupply that Church with an inexhauſtible <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

And Mr. <hi>Monroe,</hi> who likewiſe was at <hi>Rome,</hi> and view<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed thoſe <hi>Mortuary Caves,</hi> acquaints us, That ſome Authors eſpecially the Advocates for Relicks, will have them made by the Primitive Chriſtians; adding, That in the times of Perſecution they lived, held their Aſſemblies, and laid up the Bodies of <hi>Martyrs</hi> and Confeſſors in them. This, ſays the ſame Author, is the Account that prevails at <hi>Rome,</hi> and conſequent to it there are Men kept conſtantly at work in them.</p>
            <p>As ſoon as thoſe Labourers diſcover a Repoſitory, with any of the Marks of a Saint about it, Intimation is given to the Cardinal Treaſurer, who immediately ſends Men of Probity and Reputation to the Place. Where they find a <hi>Palm</hi> Painted or Engraven, or the Cypher X. p. which is commonly read, <hi>Pro Chriſto,</hi> or a ſmall round <hi>Projection</hi> in the ſide of the Gallery a little below the Repoſitory; what is within it, is carried to the Palace (there to be diſpoſed of for the beſt advantage:) Many of theſe Projections we have ſeen open with pieces of the <hi>Vials</hi> in them: the Glaſs indeed was tinctured, and 'tis pretended that in theſe Vials was conſerved the <hi>Blood</hi> of the Martyrs, which was thus laid up nigh their Bodies towards their Heads, to diſtinguiſh them from thoſe of the others that were not called to the Honour of laying down their Lives for the Faith of the Goſpel. But this Opinion is learnedly and effectually re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>futed as well by Dr. <hi>Burnet</hi> in his <hi>Travels</hi> before-mention'd, as Mr. <hi>Monroe,</hi> by Arguments and Authorities, too long to be inſerted in this Eſſay.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:003413_0025_10035408EA57B8C0"/>
And ſenior <hi>Bencini,</hi> a learned Bibliothecary at <hi>Rome,</hi> acknowledge to Mr. <hi>Monroe,</hi> that the ſo famed Cypher X. p. pretended &amp; inſiſted upon to be the Marks of a Martyr, was in uſe among the Ancients long before Chriſtianity began.</p>
            <p>As to the Inſcriptions of ſome Names at large, and Painting found in ſome of the Repoſitories, a learned An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiquary confeſſed to Dr. <hi>Burnet,</hi> That the Names were Modern, and the higheſt Antiquity that could be aſcribed to the Painting was 600 Years: So that both theſe learned Travellers agree, That there is no proof, either of the Chriſtians building theſe <hi>Catacombs,</hi> or of the Martyrs or Confeſſors being buried there; and that if they were, it is impoſſible to know and diſtinguiſh their Bones from others: And there-upon conclude, that theſe <hi>Catacombs,</hi> were firſt the burying Places of the <hi>Antient Romans,</hi> tho' afterwards ſome Chriſtian Bodies might be alſo there laid up<note n="†" place="bottom">The famous Sir <hi>Iſaac Newton</hi> is of Opinion, That theſe Catacombs were the Caves and firſt Habitations of the <hi>Aborigines</hi> of <hi>Italy.</hi>
               </note> So that in all Probability the Bones even of the <hi>Roman Slaves,</hi> or at leaſt thoſe of the meaner Sort, are now ſet in Silver and Gold, with a great deal of other coſtly Garniture, and ſent over the World, to ſeed a Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition that is as Blind as it proves Expenſive.</p>
            <p>It is very natural to ſuppoſe, That even among theſe Superſtitious Worſhippers themſelves, ſome would be under a Concern leaſt they ſhould be miſtaken in the <hi>Object'</hi> of
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:003413_0026_1003539EC59029F0"/>their Devotion: But for the Eaſe of ſuch ſcrupulous Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences, the Council of <hi>Milan</hi> declares, That <q>he is guilty of no Sin that Worſhips the Relick of one Saint for another</q>: And to compleat the Matter they ſay, <q>Tho' the Relicks Worſhipped ſhould appear to be no Saint at all, yet the Worſhipper is innocent.</q> Thus at length was this Myſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Iniquity finiſhed. And thus <hi>Vile</hi> has <hi>Rome Papal,</hi> that Mother of Harlots, made her ſelf with the <hi>Dead Bodies</hi> of Men; and her ſtately Temples, or Edifices, which ought to be Houſes of Prayer for the Reception and Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainment of true and ſpiritual Worſhippers, are like to <hi>Painted Sepulchres, full of dead Mens Bones, and all Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleanneſs,</hi> Mat. xxiii. 27.</p>

            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt.</hi> CANONIZATION. The Canonizing of Saints is defined by <hi>Bellarmine,</hi> as he is quoted by Mr. <hi>Willet,</hi> to be <q>The public determination and ſentence of the Church, whereby <hi>Men that are Dead</hi> are judged to be <hi>Saints,</hi> and worthy of Honour and Worſhip; as to

This blaſphemous Power, notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding what <hi>Bellarmine</hi> pretends, was ſo abuſed at length, that ſome of the Vileſt of Men were ſet up for Saints, and Worſhipped accordingly. Even <hi>Thomas Becket</hi> before-named, was Canonized by <hi>Pope Alexander,</hi> under a pretence that ſome Miracles were wrought by him; and the Name of the Cathedral Church at <hi>Canterbury,</hi> was alter'd from <hi>Chriſt's Church</hi> to St. <hi>Thomas Becket</hi>'s: And yet at the ſame time, the <hi>Sorboniſts</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">A Univerſity of Divines at <hi>Paris.</hi>
               </note> maintained in their Public Diſputes, <hi>He was juſtly Condemned for Rebellion:</hi> and therefore his Shrine was put down in the Reign of <hi>Henry</hi> VIII. and his Bones burnt by order of the Lord <hi>Cromwell. Agrippa</hi> before-named ſays, <q>There are many that held heretical Opinions who were counted in the Canon of Saints.</q> 
               <hi>Bonnaventure,</hi> who was guilty of Blaſphemy
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:003413_0028_10035415699EB190"/>in Aſcribing the work of Salvation to the <hi>Virgin Mary,</hi> as may be ſeen in his <hi>Ladies Pſalter,</hi> is one of the Popiſh Saints. This with much more to the ſame purpoſe may be ſeen at large in the <hi>Synopſis Papiſmi,</hi> before-mentioned.</p>
            <p>Nor is this Trade of making of Saints yet given over: No Century paſſes, but ſeveral new Saints are added to the Popiſh Calender. And it is not to be ſuppoſed, that the <hi>Roman</hi> Pontiff will make ſo valuable a Preſent as that of a new Saint, to any of the Churches or Religious Orders for nothing: This like the ancient Freedom among the <hi>Romans,</hi> muſt be purchaſed with a great Sum. At the ſame time, the Popes Brokers don't ſtick at the Price; ſince they are ſure of making their Money again of the Shrine, with great Advantage; for as Dr. <hi>Edwards</hi> in his Treatiſe of <hi>the Idolatry of the Church of Rome</hi> obſerves, <q>a new Saint at firſt, and ſo for a conſiderable time, gets the better of all the reſt.</q> D. A. <hi>Gavin</hi> before-mention'd ſays, The <hi>Sum</hi> ſettled by the Pope for the making a Saint is <hi>One hundred thouſand</hi> Crowns.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Secondly.</hi> A ſecond Branch of the Merchandize made by the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> of the <hi>Souls</hi> of Men, is the making and paying of VOWS to <hi>Saints,</hi> or ſuch as are Canoniz'd by the Pope.</p>
            <p>Having hinted at ſomething of this Superſtition already under the head of Relicks and Pilgrimages, I ſhall ſay the leſs here; not but that it very well deſerves to be Inſiſted on, and Expoſed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:003413_0029_1003541D76612C50"/>
This piece of Idolatry is a Branch of that Adoration, which the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> ſay is due to Saints in theſe words, <q>VOWS may be made to <hi>Saints</hi> properly as unto GOD, tho' not altogether in the ſame manner.</q> And they are encouraged to that Degree, that contrary to all Laws Divine and Humane; Husbands are deprived of the Power of hindering their Wives from making them.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Matter</hi> of theſe <hi>Vows</hi> is Various according to the Humour or Condition of the Perſons that make them. One will Vow to go a Pilgrimage to ſome Saint, or Holy Place: Another to enter into ſuch a Religious Society, or do ſuch a piece of Service, for the Honour of the Church: Others again, to Offer a Sum of Money, or ſuch a particular Preſent to this or that Saint, Image, Society, or Pious uſe.</p>
            <p>And as the Making theſe Vows, is very much recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended by the Doctors of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church; ſo the Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of them as rigidly Inſiſted on by the Confeſſors, who to that end, diligently enquire, among other things, of the Perſons that come to be Confeſſed, What <hi>Vows</hi> they are under, and how they have been complied with; and thoſe of them that are not Originally for Money, may be changed into a <hi>pecuniary Mulct,</hi> and ſo made Merchandize.</p>
            <p>But we ſhall ſee a much greater Abomination than this, in the Chambers of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Imagery.</p>

3. <hi>Thirdly.</hi> I proceed therefore to the third and laſt Branch of the Merchandize made of <hi>Souls</hi> departed by the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> which I propoſed to ſpeak to, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Redeeming Souls</hi> out of PURGATORY by the help of MASSES, Prayers and Indulgencies.</p>
            <p>This is generally reckoned to be the deepeſt Corruption, and the moſt profitable Invention that ever that Church was guilty of; and ſo peculiar to <hi>Rome Papal,</hi> That Mr. <hi>Willet</hi> obſerves, No other Church in Chriſtendom, even the moſt Erronious has ever taken it up; And the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet's Charge againſt Idolatrous <hi>Iſrael</hi> may be here fitly apply'd, <hi>They have ſeparated themſelves to that Shame</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Hoſ. ix. 10.</note>.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Popes</hi> PURGATORY, for ſo it may properly be called, is Defined by the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church, to be <q>a certain Infernal Place in the Earth called <hi>Purgatory,</hi> in the which, as in a Priſon houſe, thoſe who were not fully purged in this Life, are fully cleanſed and purg'd by fire, before they can be received into Heaven.</q>
            </p>
            <p>It is not to be wondred at, that this Monſtre ſtuck ſo long in the Birth: for tho' it was in a ſort Conceived by the <hi>Monks</hi> between the <hi>Fourth</hi> and <hi>Sixth Centuries,</hi> and in the following Ages, formed and faſhioned by the <hi>Biſhops</hi> and <hi>Popes</hi> of <hi>Rome;</hi> yet it was not perfectly Delivered till the Year 1439; and then this Damnable Doctrine was made an Article of Faith by the Council of <hi>Florence,</hi> and He was Curſed to Hell, that did not believe it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:003413_0031_10035428AB83F038"/>
In the <hi>next Century</hi> the Council of <hi>Trent</hi> Eſtabliſhed it yet further. The Words of the 19th Article of the <hi>Trent</hi> Creed, <q>I do Stedfaſtly Believe that there is a <hi>Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatory,</hi> and that the Souls therein detained are help'd by the Prayers of the Faithful.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The third Canon of the Council of <hi>Trent,</hi> Anathema<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizes all thoſe who ſay, the Sacrifice of the <hi>Maſs</hi> profits only him that takes it, and that it ought not to be offered for the Satisfaction of the Sins of the living &amp; the dead. <hi>Bellarmine</hi> indeed tells us, That this Doctrine muſt be underſtood only of <hi>Venial</hi> Sins, and not ſuch as are <hi>Mortal,</hi> for the latter he grants ſend Men to Hell directly.</p>
            <p>One great Point yet remain'd; and that was to make this wonderful Power of delivering Souls out of Purgatory, a <hi>Prerogative</hi> or Peculiar to the See of <hi>Rome,</hi> and fix it in the <hi>Pope,</hi> that ſo the Profits might all centre with <hi>Him.</hi> Thereupon the Canoniſts and great Doctors of that Church declare, <q>That Biſhops and other Inſeriour Prieſts cannot apply Indulgences to the Dead; it belongs only to the <hi>Pope.</hi>
               </q> Among others <hi>Johannes Angelus</hi> affirms, "The Souls in Purgatory are under the Popes Juriſdiction"; and Father <hi>Alexander,</hi> in his 5th Tome, Title <hi>Indulgences,</hi> ſays, <hi>Non Vivis Solum ſed etiam defunctis proſunt Indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gentioe e</hi> SUMMO PONTIFICE, <hi>pro illorum leva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine conceſſoe illiſque ſpeciatim applicatoe.</hi>

Thus the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church at length Eſtabliſhed the Doctrine of <hi>Purgatory</hi> in all the ſeveral Articles of it. Having done this; The next thing was to ſet up a <hi>Trade</hi> upon this Foundation, and to make Merchandize of it, for that was the Main thing deſigned all along. Here-upon the Biſhops, Prieſts and Religious of all Orders, were ſet to work, to draw in the Superſtitious People to <hi>Purchaſe</hi> theſe Maſſes, Prayers, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> at ſuch Rates, as they were pleaſed to ſet upon them, in order to redeem the Souls of their Anceſtors, Children, and other Friends, out of Purgatory. This work was ſoon accompliſhed, and the great Point quickly gained, thro' the Craft and Deluſion of the Popes Agents: for <hi>the World</hi> in thoſe Ages, as 'twas Prophecied, <hi>Wondered after the Beaſt,</hi> and being given up, <hi>Sacro-ſancta Dei Ira,</hi> to ſtrong Deluſions, they believed Lies. The Merchants and Chapmen of <hi>Rome,</hi> like <hi>Locuſts</hi> Swarmed all over the Chriſtian World, and with the greateſt Impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, tho' under the Cloak of Piety and Compaſſion to Souls, bartered away theſe Commodities, for that which was much better, Money, Lands, or any thing elſe of value they could get.</p>
            <p>This wretched Trade was carried on with ſo much Fraud and Wickedneſs, for ſo many Ages, that 'tis impoſſible, as Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi> obſerves, to read the Account of it, without both Amazement &amp; Indignation. And yet out of this very Eater at length there came forth Meat; for the Infamous <hi>Sale of Indulgences</hi> from <hi>Pope Leo</hi> the X in <hi>Saxony,</hi> was
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:003413_0033_10035431B65DFFD0"/>the very thing, which firſt diſguſted LUTHER againſt the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and happily engaged him in the GLO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RIOUS REFORMATION.</p>
            <p>Our <hi>Engliſh Hiſtories</hi> and <hi>Law-Books</hi> furniſh us with very Authentick Proofs and Inſtances of the indefatigable Pains, inſatiable Avarice, and vile Frauds of theſe <hi>Purga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory Merchants.</hi> How they would Sollicit, and even ſometimes Force Men and Women living or dying to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vote or give away ſuch a part of their Eſtates for this Pious of Redeeming Souls out of <hi>Purgatory</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">The <hi>Popiſh Synod</hi> held at <hi>Dianper</hi> in <hi>India.</hi> Anno 1599 among other Decrees Enacts. <q>That all ſuch as die worth 2000 <hi>Panoins.</hi> and have left nothing for a certain number of Purgatory Maſſes, ſhall have ſo much taken out of their Eſtates before the Diviſion among the Heirs, to be applied for the uſe aforeſaid.</q> Dr. <hi>Geddes</hi> Hiſtory of that Synod. <hi>Tag.</hi> 160.</note> This at length as an Ingenious Man obſerves, inſpired them with that In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>human Cruelty and Barbarity as made them <hi>deſire the Death</hi> of all Men. This Remark confirms that Latin Verſe quoted by the Famous <hi>John Huſs,</hi> in one of his Sermons, ſpeaking of the Avarice of the <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and the gain they make of <hi>Purgatory Maſſes,</hi>

            <p>Nor were they kinder to one another; for at the <hi>Death</hi> of <hi>Clergymen,</hi> the <hi>Pope</hi> challenged for himſelf All their Eſtates that were raiſed out of the Revenues of the Church;
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:003413_0034_100354375DE92290"/>ſo that a rich <hi>Clergyman</hi> cou'd no ſooner fall Sick, but the <hi>Popes Collectors</hi> were gaping about him for his Goods, and ſet Guards preſently about his Houſe: That by this, <hi>Biſhops</hi> have been Deſerted upon their Death Beds, and Famiſhed for want of Meat to Eat<note n="*" place="bottom">Peter de Moulin <hi>in his Treatiſe of</hi> Popal Uſurpations, <hi>Book. 4</hi>
               </note>.</p>
            <p>The firſt thing theſe Spiritual Factors laid their hands on for Returns to <hi>Rome,</hi> was the <hi>Money and Moveable Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> of the Nation; but they could not ſtop here, they had their Eye upon the <hi>Solid Eſtate</hi> of the Kingdom, in order to make a <hi>Land Bank</hi> of theſe new Bills: This alſo (to the ſhame of our Anceſtors be it ſpoken) was ſoon effected, and a great part of the <hi>Terre</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon Religious Houſes, or for ſome Pious uſe, as it was called, upon no other <hi>Conſideration,</hi> than a certain Number of theſe Indulgences for the Redemption of Souls out of Purgatory. This, Biſhop <hi>Burnet</hi> in his <hi>Expoſition of the Articles of the Church of England</hi> No. 22, ſays, was expreſs'd in the very <hi>Deeds</hi> of the Land: And he further obſerves, that theſe Endowments thro' the Profuſeneſs the World was then wrought up to by the Subtilty and vile Practices of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Clergy, increaſed to ſo vaſt a Degree; that if the <hi>Parliament of England</hi> had not by ſeveral <hi>Statutes of Mortmain</hi> reſtrained this crying Abuſe, the very Conſtitution of the Nation might in time have been ſubverted, and the <hi>Temporalties</hi> wholly ſubjected to the <hi>Spirituality,</hi> and in time the <hi>People</hi> have been all
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:003413_0035_1003543E5E8621F8"/>Tenants or Farmers to the <hi>Clergy.</hi> For which Reaſon he is clear in the point; That the States and Princes of Chriſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom were at full Liberty upon the Diſcovery of theſe Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtures, to <hi>void</hi> all the Endowments that had followed upon them, and either to apply them to better Uſes, or to reſtore 'em to the Families from which they had been drawn, if that had been practicable, or to convert them to any other Uſe. Thus that Learned Man.</p>
            <p>This Rule was notably put in Practice by our King HENRY the VIIIth, with the Advice and Aſſiſtance of thoſe two famous Worthies, THOMAS CROMWELL Earl of Eſſex, and Arch Biſhop CRANMER.</p>
            <p>It muſt be acknowledged, that thro' the tender Mercy of GOD, when the Day ſpring from on high viſited ſo many of the Nations at the Reformation, the Riches of this Merchandize we are treating of, <hi>in one Hour,</hi> as the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetical Phraſe is, came to nought in the Proteſtant Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries; ſo that no Man, <hi>i. e.</hi> no <hi>wiſe Man,</hi> no good Proteſtant would buy of it any more, <hi>Rev.</hi> xviii. 11. Yet alas! there are Millions that continue, and it is to be feared willingly, to be impoſed on and cheated with theſe Wares, even to this Day: for this is an Iniquity that will not be purged from the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church till She dye.</p>
            <p>A Modern Traveller, in a Book Entituled, <hi>The Frauds of Romiſh Monks and Prieſts,</hi> Vol. I. Letter 5. informs
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:003413_0036_1003543FE432C110"/>us, that the <hi>Society</hi> of the Souls in <hi>Purgatory</hi> is the moſt general <hi>Confraternity</hi> of all their Religious Orders, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>longing to all Churches, and to all Prieſts as well Secular as Regular; and that there is never a Village in <hi>Italy,</hi> how ſmall and inconſiderable ſoever, which has not a Confrater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for the Souls in Purgatory.</p>
            <p>Among innumerable other Frauds committed by the Prieſts in the <hi>Sale</hi> of theſe Maſſes to the People, recounted by this Author, I ſhall ſingle out <hi>One,</hi> and ſo draw to a cloſe of the Diſſertation. <q>'Tis a common Practice, he ſays, when any one ſends Money to a Convent for a <hi>Hundred</hi> Maſſes, they content themſelves with Singing <hi>One,</hi> with the Aſſiſtance of the Deacon and Sub-Deacon: ('tis the <hi>Prior</hi> or <hi>Guardian</hi> of the College that Sings) They call this, a <hi>Maſs Sung,</hi> a <hi>Solemn Maſs:</hi>
               </q> and they maintain that <hi>One</hi> of theſe Maſſes is an Equivalent to a <hi>great Number</hi> of Common ones. This Stratagem they call, <hi>making a Reduction:</hi> And tho' <hi>Pope Innocent</hi> the XI diſcountenanced this Practice; yet he and his Succeſſours Indulged them in another that ſerves the turn as well, and that is Celebrating a <hi>Maſs or two,</hi> at a <hi>Priviledged Altar,</hi> which as Infallibly delivers a Soul out of Purgatory, as a <hi>Thouſand</hi> at any other: (this no Proteſtant will deny) But then theſe Privileged Altars are not obtained from the Pope, without great Sums of Money. Thus indeed the Pope has outwitted the Prieſts; but the Cheat is ſtill the ſame to the People; for the Maxim of that Church is, <hi>Si Populus Vult decipi, decipiatar.</hi>

Nor is this Merchandize of the Bodies and Souls of Men carried on only among the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Countries in <hi>Europe;</hi> for the Merchants of Myſtical Babylon are of late opening a Trade with theſe wretched Commodities in <hi>India, China,</hi> and other ends of the Earth<note n="*" place="bottom">See Dr. <hi>Geddes</hi>'s Hiſtory of the Church of <hi>Malabar.</hi> and Synod of <hi>Diamper;</hi> and the curious and edifying <hi>Letters of the Jeſuits</hi> from their Foreign Miſſions, Publiſhed <hi>Anno</hi> 1707.</note>.

And</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Firſt,</hi> The making Merchandize of the Souls &amp; Bodies of Men, gives us a Specimen of the Exquiſite <hi>Policy</hi> of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Merchandizing has always been eſteemed a Myſtery that required agreat deal of Wiſdom to manage it to Advantage: Accordingly we read of the <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Tyrus,</hi> that by Wiſdom and Underſtanding in Traffick, he got and increaſed his Riches, <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxviii. 4, 5. There was ſcarce any Commodity then in the known World, but what the Merchants of <hi>Tyre</hi> (that great <hi>Emporium</hi> in her day) traded in, and enriched themſelves by; as we find at large in the Deſcription of the Wealth and Trade of that City, <hi>Chap.</hi> xxvii. of the ſame <hi>Prophet.</hi> But neither they, nor the wiſe Men of Antient <hi>Babylon,</hi> ever dreamt of making Merchandize of <hi>Ghoſts</hi> and <hi>Dead Bodies:</hi> this was a Reſerve for Myſtical <hi>Babylon,</hi> and is a Maſter-piece of Popery.</p>

How exactly does the Practice of the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church expoſed in the Eſſay, anſwer this Prophecy of the Apoſtle? Por tho' this Merchandizing the Bodies &amp; Souls of Men be notoriouſly wicked, the Gain of it diſhoneſt, and the Buyers cheated &amp; abuſed; yet 'tis all diſguiſed and covered over with a pretence of Piety, Religious Worſhip, and the ſaving of Souls.</p>

Again, If Truth and Juſtice in Trade give Honour and Reputation to the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant, and on the other hand Fraud and Couzenage in Dealing render Men Vile and Odious; how deteſtable muſt Popery appear in the Eyes of all Juſt and Good Men, and the Apoſtate Church be avoided as a common Cheat?</p>

5. <hi>Fiſthly,</hi> We may hence ſee ſomething of the Glory of the Spirit of Prophecy, and the Divine Original of the Apocalypſe, in revealing this Myſtery of Iniquity (treated of in the Eſſay) ſo many <hi>hundred Years</hi> before ever it appeared. The Pre-viſion and Revealing of future Events, more eſpecially the Times and Changes that are to paſs over the Church of GOD, and among the Nations, long before they come on, is a Prerogative, which the Omniſcient GOD appropriates to Himſelf, in very awful terms, Iſa, xli. 23. <hi>Shew the things that are to come hereafter, that we may know that ye are gods.</hi> Chap. xlvi. 9, 10. <hi>I am GOD, there is none like me, declaring the End from the Beginning, and from antient Times the things that are not yet done— John's</hi> Baniſhment into <hi>Patmos,</hi> is generally placed in the XIVth.

6. <hi>Sixthly,</hi> This Merchandizing the Bodies &amp; Souls of Men ſhows, Of what abſolute Neceſſity it is for Churches and Chriſtians, to make the WORD of GOD, the only Rule of Faith and Worſhip.</p>
            <p>The early Degeneracy and after <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> of the Chriſtian Church, has been all along matter of Wonder, and is not eaſily accounted for. The Primitive Fathers in the Writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings they have left us, complain of Pride, Covetouſneſs and Ambition, eſpecially in the Biſhops and Paſtors, as the great Cauſe of it: But by the beſt Judgment I can make from the nature of the thing it ſelf, and the Hiſtory of thoſe times, no one thing proved of ſuch fatal Conſequence to the pure Faith and Worſhip of the Primitive Chriſtians, as their ſwerving or declining from the SCRIPTURES, and not <hi>continuing ſtedfaſtly in the Apoſtles Doctrine.</hi> Had the Churches been mindful of the Words ſpoken to them by the Holy Prophets, and of the Commandment of the Apoſtles, and touched every new Doctrine and Ritual, by the <hi>Law</hi> and <hi>the Teſtimony;</hi> they had not been ſo eaſily impoſed on by thoſe falſe Teachers (that aroſe quickly after the Death of the Apoſtles) Men that Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted the Word of GOD with their own Inventions and bold Additions: and great ſtreſs was laid on <hi>Traditions,</hi> pretended to be from the Apoſtles; ſo that at length the Church forſook the Guide of her Youth, and then no wonder her Houſe inclined to Death, and her Paths to the dead. A multitude of Errors and Superſtitions, one after another, (and among the reſt, the Popiſh Relicks and
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:003413_0048_10036A33DB5B72D0"/>Pilgrimages, with the curſed Doctrine of Purgatory treated of in the Eſſay) crept in and deſtroyed the Purity and Power of that Faith &amp; Worſhip once delivered to the Saints.</p>
            <p>Theſe things were firſt introduced and managed more <hi>Covertly,</hi> by Men of Subtilty and Deſign, that walked in Craftineſs and handled the Word of GOD deceitfully: But afterwards the Biſhops of <hi>Rome</hi> carried the work on more <hi>openly,</hi> and with the utmoſt Impudence, aſſuming to themſelves and their Councils, the ſole Power of Judging what, or which was Scripture, and accordingly took upon them to alter and to amend the Scriptures; and deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined that the Scriptures were not ſufficient without Tradition, and that Apoſtolical Traditions were of equal Authority with the Writings of the Apoſtles: And yet all this would not ſerve the turn, ſo long as the Fountain was kept open, and Chriſtians could have recourſe to the BIBLE, and thereby diſcern the vile Abuſes put upon them. And therefore in order to compleat the Ruin of the Primitive Faith and Worſhip, the <hi>Romiſh</hi> Church at length took away the Key of Knowledge, and forbid the Common People the Reading of the Scriptures, upon this falſe Principle (among others) that Ignorance is the Mother of Devotion<note n="†" place="bottom">The Council of <hi>Tholouſe,</hi> Anno 1 2 2 9. Strictly forbid the Laity the Uſe of any Books of the Holy Scripture, except the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> and they are forbidden in the Vulgar Tongue. <hi>Howels</hi> View of the <hi>Pontificate,</hi> At this day in <hi>Spain, Portugal, Italy,</hi> and ſome other Popiſh Countries, (where the Merchandize of Bodies and Souls is principally carried on) a Layman cannot have a <hi>Bible</hi> in his Houſe without a Licence from the Biſhop, or Pariſh Prieſt. In <hi>Spain,</hi> very few of the <hi>Clergy</hi> have the <hi>Bible</hi> in their Houſes; and in General, They call it, a <hi>Book of Hereſies.</hi> Gavin</note>.</p>

This great Iniquity of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> has been matter of Offence to ſome, even of their own Communion, Particularly the famous Father <hi>Queſnel,</hi> who in his ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable <hi>Theſes,</hi> publiſhed about <hi>twenty Years</hi> ſince, with great Earneſtneſs, declares againſt forbidding Chriſtians the Reading of the Holy Scriptures, eſpecially the Goſpel, or keeping it cloſe and bound up in an unknown Tongue, as a moſt heinous Sin. His Phraſe in Engliſh is, <q>That they who are Guilty of it, do in effect ſhut the Mouth of CHRIST againſt the People.</q> But this with many other Orthodox and Pious Propoſitions were Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned at <hi>Rome,</hi> by the Bull <hi>Unigenitus,</hi> that makes ſuch an <hi>Eclat</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> at this Day.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now conclude the whole with <hi>this one Remark,</hi> That nothing Contributed more to the Bleſſed Reformation from Popery, than the <hi>Tranſlating</hi> and <hi>Printing</hi> the <hi>Bible</hi> in the ſeveral Languages of the Nations<note n="*" place="bottom">Before the Invention of Printing, which was about <hi>Anno</hi> 1 4 3 0. a <hi>Bible</hi> writ fair on Velum or Parchment coſt 400 Crowns; and upon the firſt Impreſſion, they were Sold for <hi>Four</hi> Crowns a piece, and at length for One.

               </note> and Reſtoring the free Uſe of the Scriptures to the People. And, as One of the Main Bulwarks of the Proteſtant Churches, is their Declaring the Scriptures to be not only a ſufficient, but the only Rule of Faith and Worſhip; ſo we may humbly Hope, That while they walk according
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:003413_0050_10034EEC303C4C10"/>to this Rule, under the Care and Leading of the <hi>Great Shepherd,</hi> they will be kept from Falling, and preſerved Blameleſs to the coming of our LORD JESUS CHRIST, to whom be Glory for ever, and ever, <hi>AMEN.</hi>

            <p>In order to Correct the general Opinion above-mentioned, and to ſet that matter in a full &amp; clear light, there needs no more than a careful Comparing the following Places, <hi>viz.

            <p>As to the <hi>firſt Muſter</hi> Recorded, <hi>Numbers</hi> Chap. I, They only, were to be numbred, that were able to go forth to <hi>War:</hi> Now the <hi>Levites</hi> were never reckoned as Part of the <hi>Militia;</hi> and verſe 47, It is expreſly ſaid, the <hi>Levites</hi> were not numbred among them; and the ſpecial Reaſon is given in the following verſes. This firſt Muſter was made at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron,</hi> in the Second Year after their coming out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> and referr'd to in <hi>Exodus</hi> XXXVIII Chap. verſe 26.

<pb n="47" facs="unknown:003413_0053_10036A4B30351080"/>which was made by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Eleazer,</hi> in the Plains of <hi>Moab, Thirty-eight</hi> Years afterwards, we find the ſame Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitation and Exception, <hi>Numbers</hi> XXVI. 2. and in the 62 verſe. <hi>For they</hi> (i. e. the Levites) <hi>were not num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred among the Children of Iſrael, becauſe there was no Inheritance given them among the Children of Iſrael:</hi> For they only were to be numbred of the Congregation of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to whom the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> was to be divided for an Inheritance, as in <hi>verſe</hi> 53.</p>
            <p>It is very plain from the Places before cited, That as in the terrible <hi>Commination</hi> of Dying in the Wilderneſs, and being Excluded from <hi>Canaan,</hi> recorded in the XIV Chap; ſo in the awful <hi>Execution</hi> of that Sentence recorded in the XXVI Chapter, the two laſt verſes, the <hi>Levites</hi> were not included.</p>
            <p>To begin with the Sentence in the XIV Chapter; more eſpecially thoſe words in the 29th verſe, <hi>Your Carcaſſes ſhall fall in this Wilderneſs, and all that were numbred of you according to your whole number from twenty Years old and upward, which have Murmured againſt Me, ſhall not come into the Land,</hi> &amp;c.

            <p>And the matter is full as clear after the Sentence was executed, <hi>Chapter</hi> XXVI, and the two laſt verſes: But among theſe there was not a Man of them whom <hi>Moſes</hi> and

II. verſes 14, 15, 16. <hi>And the ſpace in which we came from Kadeſh Barnea, until we were come over the Brook Zered, was thirty and eight Years, until all the Generation of the</hi> MEN OF WAR, <hi>were waſted out from among the Hoſt, as the LORD Sware unto them; for indeed the Hand of the LORD was againſt them to deſtroy them from among the Hoſt until they were con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed: ſo it came to paſs, when all the</hi> MEN OF WAR <hi>were conſumed and dead from among the People,</hi> &amp;c. Theſe words are ſo plain in favour of the <hi>Levites,</hi> that they need no Commentary or Inference.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, it can by no means be maintained, That no other Men entred <hi>Canaan</hi> that were twenty Years of Age at their coming out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> ſave JOSHUA and CALEB, as the Learned <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Chronological Connection,</hi> &amp;c. aſſerts. All that can be ſafely ſaid is, That of 603550 effective Men of the Age of twenty Years and upwards, that were Polled at Mount <hi>Sinai</hi> by <hi>Moſes</hi> and

               <hi>Aaron,</hi> in the ſecond Year after their coming out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> viz. of the Tribes of <hi>Reuben, Simeon, Judah, Iſſachar, Zebulon, Ephraim, Manaſſeh, Renjamin, Dan, Aſhur Gad</hi> and <hi>Napthali,</hi> none of this mighty Hoſt went into <hi>Canaan,</hi> but JOSHUA and CALEB. The Carcaſſes of all the reſt fell in the Wilderneſs.</p>
            <p>As to the Tribe of LEVI, or the <hi>Levites,</hi> their Sum or Number, was taken <hi>twice.</hi> In the <hi>Firſt</hi> Poll, all the Males of a <hi>Month Old,</hi> and upward, were counted, in order to make an Equivalent for all the firſt born in <hi>Iſrael:</hi> This firſt number of <hi>Levites</hi> amounted to 22000; <hi>Numbers,</hi> Chap.III. The <hi>ſecond</hi> Poll of this Tribe, was of Men fit for the ſervice of the <hi>Tabernacle,</hi> viz. between the Age of <hi>Thirty</hi> and <hi>Fifty,</hi> and amounted to 8580, <hi>Chap.</hi> IV. Theſe Numberings, for what appears were Contemporary with the firſt General Numbring of the Children of <hi>Iſrael:</hi> If ſo, we can't allow leſs than 10000 Men of the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> of the Age of twenty Years and upward at the time of the fatal Sentence aforeſaid; for that was paſs'd in the ſame Year the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> were firſt numbred; ſo that it is not only conſiſtent with the ſacred Hiſtory, but highly probable that even <hi>Thouſands</hi> of LEVITES of the Age of twenty Years and upwards, at the time of the Children of <hi>Iſraels</hi> coming out of <hi>Aegypt,</hi> went Triumphantly into <hi>Canaan</hi> with JOSHUA and CALEB.</p>
            <p>I ſhall now Conſider, and Anſwer the two principal Places relyed on, in favour of the common Opinion.</p>
            <p n="1">

               <hi>I.</hi> The firſt is <hi>Numbers</hi> XIV. v. 2. <hi>ALL the Children of Iſrael Murmured againſt Moſes,</hi> &amp;c. Verſe 10. <hi>ALL the Congregation bad Stone them with Stones:</hi> And verſe 22. <hi>Becauſe ALL theſe Men which have ſeen my Glory,</hi> &amp;c, <hi>ſurely they ſhall not ſee the Land,</hi> &amp;c. From hence it is argued, That the <hi>Levites</hi> were part of the Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and of ſo among the <hi>Murmurers,</hi> and therefore came under the Sentence of Excluſion as well as the reft.</p>
            <p>To this it is Anſwered,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. That the whole Chapter being taken together (as it ought) 'twill appear, who the Murmurers, or Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tineers were: For tho' in the 27th. verſe it be ſaid, <hi>I have beard the Murmurings of the Children of Iſrael,</hi> Indefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitely; yet in the 29th verſe, we have plainly a Reſtriction; for the Words are, <hi>Your Carcaſſes ſhall fall in this Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and</hi> ALL THAT WERE NUMBERED <hi>of you, according to your whole number from twenty Years old and upward, which have murmured againſt me,</hi> &amp;c. So that if GOD himſelf, who was the Judge, charged the Mutiny or Murmuring only upon thoſe that were <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered</hi> in the firſt Muſter by <hi>Moſes</hi> and <hi>Aaron</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> viz. From twenty Years old and upwards; who ſhall charge it upon the <hi>Levites,</hi> who were not in that Roll?</p>
            <p n="2">2. It is plain from the Hiſtory, that the <hi>Evil Report</hi> brought of the Land of <hi>Canaan</hi> by the <hi>Spies,</hi> or thoſe
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:003413_0057_10036A620FBB5418"/>Men that were ſent by <hi>Moſes</hi> to ſearch out the Land, was the next and great <hi>Occaſion</hi> of that <hi>Murmuring</hi> and <hi>Mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiny</hi> of the Children of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> which excluded them the promis'd Land: Now the Tribe of <hi>Levi</hi> had <hi>no Repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatine</hi> among thoſe <hi>Spies,</hi> as may be ſeen at large in the XIII <hi>Chap.</hi> of <hi>Numbers,</hi> where the Spies and the ſeveral Tribes they were reſpectively taken from, are expreſs'd by Name. And therefore, however it might Fare with any <hi>particular Levite</hi> (if any ſuch there were) concern'd in that Rebellion, yet the Tribe of LEVI, <hi>as a Tribe,</hi> could not in juſtice fall under the terrible Sentence of Excluſion. In like manner, had the <hi>Tribes</hi> of <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Ephraim</hi> diſtinguiſhed themſelves on this Occaſion, and ſtood by the Report of <hi>Caleb</hi> and <hi>Joſhua,</hi> who were ſent and inſtructed by them, it is probable they had likewife been Exempted: but inſtead of that, the <hi>Principals</hi> of theſe Tribes, <hi>viz. Judah</hi> and <hi>Ephraim,</hi> baſely deſerted them, and turned over to the <hi>other Ten Spies,</hi> and therefore were juſtly involved in the ſame common ruin.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Beſides which, it is very unlikely, that the <hi>Levites</hi> who had but a little before, <hi>viz.</hi> in the Buſineſs of the <hi>Golden Calf,</hi> diſtinguiſhed themſelves from the Reſt of the Congregation, by appearing with <hi>Moſes</hi> on the LORD's <hi>ſide;</hi> or as the Expreſſion is, <hi>Conſecrated</hi> themſelves that day unto the LORD, and thereby obtained a Bleſſing; I ſay it is very unlikely, that they ſhould ſo ſoon after engage in this Mutiny, and be found among the <hi>Murmurers;</hi>
               <pb n="52" facs="unknown:003413_0058_10034EF45E98DED8"/>eſpecially if it be conſidered, what <hi>Moſes</hi> ſays of that Tribe in his laſt Bleſſing, <hi>Deut.</hi> XXXII. 9. <hi>They have obſerved thy Word, and kept thy Covenant.</hi>

            <p>
               <hi>Sol.</hi> 1. To this I Anſwer, That <hi>Moſes</hi> here plainly Alludes to the XIV <hi>Chapter,</hi> where the matter is Record at large, and where it is Evident, the Commination was point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only at thoſe that were numbred in the <hi>firſt Muſter, viz.</hi> at Mount <hi>Sinai;</hi> and according to the Rule given to us by Divines, for the Interpretation of Scripture, <hi>This</hi> Reference, or Abridgment muſt be explained and governed by the Text and Hiſtory at large in the XIV <hi>Chapter,</hi> and not <hi>that</hi> by <hi>this;</hi> ſo that what has been ſaid already on the XIVth <hi>Chapter,</hi> will ſerve for an Anſwer to this.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Beſides, If the 13 <hi>verſe</hi> even of this Context be well conſidered, which runs thus, <hi>And the LORD's Anger was kindled againſt Iſrael, and He made them wander in the Wilderneſs forty Years, until all the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration that had done Evil in the ſight of the LORD was Conſumed;</hi> and compared with the other parallel Places before-mentioned; and eſpecially that of <hi>Deute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ronomy</hi> II. 14, 15, 16: It will appear that the
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:003413_0059_10036A6535B40FE8"/>Generation that did Evil in the ſight of the <hi>LORD,</hi> and were conſumed, as noticed in the XXXII Chapter of <hi>Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers,</hi> were the Generation of the <hi>Men of War,</hi> againſt whom the Hand of the <hi>LORD</hi> was, and who dyed, and were conſumed, as the <hi>LORD</hi> Swear unto them: Thus <hi>Moſes</hi> himſelf explains it. And <hi>Joſhua</hi> after the death of <hi>Moſes,</hi> gives the ſame Account of this Matter; <hi>Joſhua</hi> V. 4 &amp; 5. <hi>All the People, that came out of Aegypt, that were Males, even</hi> ALL THE MEN OF WAR. <hi>dyed in the Wilderneſs;</hi> and more fully in the 6 verſe; <hi>For the Children of Iſrael walked forty Years in the Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, till all the People that were Men of War which came out of Aegypt were conſumed, becauſe they obeyed not the voice of the LORD: unto whom the LORD ſware that he would not ſhew them the Land which the LORD ſware unto their Fathers that He would give us, a Land that ſloweth with milk and honey.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I come now to take a brief Notice, of the <hi>Miſtake</hi> I hinted at, touching the AGE of ELEAZER the Prieſt.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Author</hi> of the <hi>Chronological Connection,</hi> before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, Affirms that <hi>Eleazer</hi> and <hi>Ithamar</hi> Sons of <hi>Aaron</hi> could not be twenty Years old at the coming out of <hi>Aegypt.</hi> The truth of it is, He that will Aſſert, that every Man of the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> that came out of <hi>Aegypt</hi> at twenty Years of Age (ſave CALEB and JOSHUA) dyed in the Wilderneſs; will be under a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:003413_0060_10036A6BB1EFCC58"/>of ſaying, that ELEAZER was under twenty Years, when he came out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> For it is moſt certain, that be went into <hi>Canaan</hi> with <hi>Joſhua.</hi> But let us a little Examine the particular Caſe of ELEAZER.</p>
            <p>The firſt mention that we find of him, is <hi>Exodus</hi> VI. 23, &amp; 25. <hi>And ELEAZER Aaron's Son took him one of the Daughters of</hi> Putiel <hi>to Wife, and ſhe bove him</hi> Phineas, <hi>&amp;c. Theſe are the HEADS of the FATHERS of the LEVITES, according to their Families.</hi> Here <hi>firſt,</hi> ELEAZER is taken notice of, as one that had been Married ſometime, and alſo the Birth of his Son <hi>Phineas,</hi> that was ſo famous in the Wilderneſs. <hi>Secondly;</hi> the Text reckons ELEAZER, among the <hi>Heads</hi> of the <hi>Fathers</hi> of the <hi>Levites:</hi> and is it probable that all this while he ſhould be under the Age of <hi>Twenty?</hi> It cannot be. In the next place, I would have it conſidered, that ELEAZER entred upon, and executed the <hi>Prieſts Office</hi> in the Wilderneſs, in the Second Year after their coming out of <hi>Egypt:</hi> See <hi>Levit.</hi> VIII. 9, 10. particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly Chap. X. verſe 16 to the end. Now the <hi>Prieſts</hi> were not to enter upon their Office till <hi>thirty</hi> Years of Age, <hi>Numbers</hi> IV. 1, 2, 3. Moreover the Figure that <hi>Eleazer</hi> made in <hi>Egypt,</hi> and quickly after their coming from thence, beſpeaks him not only a Perſon of Gravity, but a Man of Years. JOSHUA was <hi>forty-five</hi> Years old when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> and yet he is called a Young Man. Theſe two famous Worthies JOSHUA and ELEAZER entred into <hi>Canaan</hi> together; and by the Hiſtory ſeemed to have dyed about the ſame
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:003413_0061_10036A7451C15960"/>time. And it is very probable they might be near of an Age, as MOSES and AARON their Prodeceſſors were. However that be, I ſubmit it to the Learned, Whether upon the whole it be probable, much leſs certain, that ELEAZER was under <hi>Twenty</hi> Years of Age, when the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> came out of <hi>Egypt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>P. S. <hi>It was no ſmall Satisfaction to me, after I had drawn up the Materials of this Exercitation, and in a manner digeſted it, to find the Learned Monſieur</hi> Saurin <hi>himſelf of the ſame Opinion, to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the</hi> end <hi>of his</hi> Vol. <hi>before-mentioned,</hi> viz. <hi>pag.</hi> 561. <hi>tho' he ſays nothing as to the caſe of</hi> Eleazer <hi>in particular. Had I made any uſe of his Method or Arguments, I ſhould readily have acknowledged is.</hi>

            <head>The <hi>ORACLE</hi> OF The TRUE GOD Compar'd with <hi>thoſe</hi> of the <hi>Heathen.</hi> IN An OCCASIONAL MEDITATION On I. <hi>Samuel</hi> XXIII. 11, 12.</head>
            <p>AMONG the various ways or divers manners wherein GOD was pleaſed to ſpeak to the Fathers in times paſt, the Anſwers given from before the HOLY ORACLE was one. This Method indeed was not uſed, upon ordinary Occaſions, but <hi>pro re nata,</hi> in caſes of extraordinary Difficulty and Importance, eſpecially when the Public was concerned. How or in what manner theſe Oracular Reſponſes were given, I ſhall not here determine. The Learned cannot agree upon it. The <hi>Jews</hi> ſay the Anſwer was underſtood and taken from the <hi>Luſtre</hi> with which the <hi>Stones</hi> in the Breaſt-Plate of the High Prieſt ſhone at that time. Some of the Learned are of Opinion, that an <hi>Articulate Voice</hi> was heard from within the <hi>Sanctum Sanctorum.</hi> And
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:003413_0063_10036A7D04A26E90"/>other, that it was by an extraordinary <hi>Impreſſion</hi> upon the <hi>Mind</hi> of the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> who may be ſuppoſed at that time to be in ſuch a frame of Spirit as was ſuited to receive and infallibly to judge of the Revelation. That which ſeems moſt probable to me is, That this Sacred and Myſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terious Ordinance was under the Direction &amp; Management of the <hi>High Prieſt,</hi> or the Perſon who executed that Office: And that accordingly He declared the Mind and Will of GOD upon the matter. For this ſee <hi>Numbers</hi> XXVII. 21. I. <hi>Sam.</hi> XXX. 7, 8. <hi>Nehemiah</hi> VII. 65. In imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of <hi>this Oracle,</hi> the Nations that Correſponded with the <hi>Jews,</hi> and eſpecially the <hi>Grecians,</hi> in honour of their Gods, ſet up Oracles in their Temples. But as the Portion of <hi>Jacob</hi> was not like thoſe Dunghill Deities, ſo neither were their Vanities and work of Errors to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared with the <hi>Oracle</hi> of the true and living GOD.</p>
            <p>Here, among other things it might be obſerv'd, That <hi>Acceſs</hi> to the Heathen Oracles was <hi>difficult,</hi> and only to be had at <hi>ſet times.</hi> The Learned Dr. <hi>Potter</hi> in his <hi>Grecian Antiquities,</hi> tells us, That the Time of Conſulting the Oracle of <hi>Delphos</hi> at firſt was only <hi>one Month</hi> in the Year, and the <hi>Seventh Day</hi> of that Month; and in the latter Ages, Oracles us'd only to be given <hi>once</hi> every Month. Whereas the Oracle of GOD ſtood continually open to the humble &amp; true Worſhipper; agreeable to that of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> LX. 11. <hi>Her Gates ſhall be open coptinually, they ſhall not be ſhut Day nor Night.</hi>

And even at the <hi>Times appointed</hi> by thoſe Heathen Oracles; the Oracle itſelf was frequently <hi>Sullen</hi> and ſtood <hi>Mute:</hi> and for this Reaſon among others the <hi>Scripture</hi> calls them <hi>Dumb Idols;</hi> as <hi>Hab.</hi> II. 18. I. Cor. XII. a. Thus when the poor Worſhippers of <hi>Baal</hi> cried aloud— there was <hi>neither voice, nor hearing, nor any that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded,</hi> I.

            <p>But the great Difference between the <hi>Divine Oracle</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> which I would obſerve from
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:003413_0065_10036A85F8C65128"/>the Words under Conſideration, is the <hi>Nature</hi> or <hi>Property</hi> of the <hi>Reſponſes</hi> given: For while the Anſwers of the Heathen Oracles were dark and evaſive, doubtful and precarious; thoſe delivered by the Oracle of JEHOVAH, were plain and conciſe, certam and ſaſe, even to a Proverb, as we learn from I. Sam. XVI. 23. <hi>And the Counſel of</hi> ACHITOPHEL <hi>was, as if a Man bad enquired at the</hi> ORACLE <hi>of</hi> GOD. A very remarkable proof and inſtance of this, we have here Recorded by the Prophet <hi>Samuel. David</hi> being in great diſtreſs, and at a loſs what to do, has recourſe to the <hi>Oracle</hi> of GOD, and humbly propoſes <hi>two Queſtions.</hi> 1. Whether <hi>Saul</hi> would really come down after him? 2. Whether the Men of <hi>Keilah</hi> (to whom he had been ſuch a Protector) would deliver him up to <hi>Saul?</hi> To theſe two ſhort, but impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Queſtions, <hi>David</hi> receives a full, plain Anſwer: To the firſt SAUL <hi>will come down;</hi> to the ſecond, <hi>The Men of</hi> Keilah <hi>will deliver thee up.</hi> What a lively Oracle was here, and how plain was <hi>David</hi>'s way made before him? See alſo an Inſtance of the ſame nature, in I. <hi>Sam.</hi> XXX. 6, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>But now let us ſee what Treatment Idolaters were wont to meet with from their wretched Oracles, when they reſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to them for Counſel in matters of the greateſt Importance. Their Reſponſes were either ſo Dark and Uncertain, that nothing at all could be made of them; or elſe the Words were ſo ambiguous, and contrived with ſuch a double
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:003413_0066_10036A8C04220F48"/>
               <hi>entendre,</hi> that they might be interpreted both ways, in the Affirmative or Negative, like that doubtful Sentence, <hi>Ibis redibis nunquam per bella peribis;</hi> which has <hi>two Meanings,</hi> according as you refer the Word <hi>Nunquam.</hi> And yet <hi>Plutarch,</hi> in his Treatiſe of the <hi>Pythian</hi> Oracle, makes an Apology, ſuch a one as 'tis, for the Obſcurity and double Meaning of theſe oracular Anſwers. Hence it often came to paſs, That the Perſon concerned, taking the <hi>Wrong,</hi> was Deceived and Ruined: Thus it happen'd to <hi>Pyrrhus</hi> of <hi>Epyrus,</hi> when he engaged in a War with the <hi>Romans,</hi> who had this Anſwer from the Oracle.</p>

               </note> was ſo remarkable for this way of anſwering Queſtions, That <hi>Ambiguous</hi> and <hi>Delphic</hi> Anſwers ſignified at length the ſame thing. Theſe obſcure and equivocal Reſponſes, were doubtleſs owing to the Art and Subtilty, of thoſe that managed the Oracle; that ſo, as the Learned Dr. <hi>Potter</hi> in his <hi>Grecian Antiquities</hi> obſerves, <q>If the event happened contrary to any Mans Expectation, he might rather find fault with his own Interpretation of the Oracles, than call in Queſtion either the Knowledge, or Veracity of <hi>Appollo.</hi>

            <p>It is generally believed from the beſt Authorities, both of Chriſtian and Heathen Writers, That theſe counterfeit Oracles, quickly after the coming of CHRIST, and the ſetting up His Kingdom in the World, ceaſed, and came to nought.</p>
            <p>As to the Oracle of GOD before-mentioned, I ſuppoſe I need not inform thoſe that Read the Scriptures, and more eſpecially the Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> with care &amp; diligence, That as all the Ordinances of Divine Service under the firſt Covenant, were but a Figure for that time of good thing, to come, and therefore deſigned from the beginning but as a temporary Diſpenſation; ſo when the Subſtance was come thoſe Shadows fled away.</p>

This is treated of, and proved at large by the Apoſtle in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Hebrews,</hi> particularly in the VIII, IX, and Xth <hi>Chapters:</hi> And the Oracular Anſwers above ſpoken of, being typical, and a branch of the <hi>Prophetical</hi> Office of JESUS CHRIST, were ſuperſeded and laid aſide when the SON OF GOD, <gap reason="foreign">

The Advantage which the <hi>Jews</hi> of old had above the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> lay chiefly in this, That to them were committed the <hi>Oracles</hi> of GOD<note n="*" place="bottom">
