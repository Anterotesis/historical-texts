            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

preſervation of Peace and Quietneſs among men: for which all Chriſtians ought to Pray earneſtly unto God; which is the Duty the Apoſtle exhorts to in our Text.</p>
            <p>The Exhortation is, 1. <hi>General,</hi> Expreſs'd in the preceding Verſe; <hi>I exhort therefore, that firſt of all, Supplications, Prayers, Interceſſions, &amp; giving of Thanks be made for all men:</hi> Prayer is the Duty here Exhorted to; and I con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive the Variety of Phraſes by which the Apoſtle expreſſes it, is not Needleſs or Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfluous, but that it has its Significancy, and intimates to us at leaſt the Neceſſity and Importance of the Duty; and the Fervency wherewith it is to be performed: The A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle adds giving of Thanks, which though it be not Eſſential to Prayer, yet by Divine Order it is to be inſerted into all our Prayers: <hi>Phil.</hi> 4. 6. <hi>But in every thing by Prayer and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication with Thankſgiving, let your Requeſts be made known unto God:</hi> And indeed it is high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Reaſonable ſeeing God continually Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſters to us Matter and Occaſions of Thankſgiving; and as we ought to Pray for Mercy for all Men, which is the firſt Branch of the Exhortation (except it be for ſuch as are Guilty of the Sin, for which the Apoſtle would not ſay that Chriſtians ought to Pray, which Exception is to be underſtood in the Apoſtles Exhortation) ſo we ought in our
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:001955_0004_0FBA419541AD90C0"/>
Prayers for them to offer Thankſgiving to God on their behalf, for the Bounties and Bleſſings He is continually beſtowing upon them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Particular,</hi> As in the Text; where we may obſerve two things.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) The Perſons we are Exhorted to Pray for, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>For Kings, &amp; for all in Authority;</hi> or all that are in Eminent Place, as it might have been rendered: Which intends thoſe that have Supreme Authority &amp; all that are Commiſſionated by them, and Govern under them; thus the Apoſtle Phraſeth it under another Head, 1<hi>Pet.</hi> 2. 13, 14. <hi>Whether it be to the King, as Supreme; Or unto Governours, as unto thoſe that are ſent by him.</hi> Which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tends the Supreme and all Inferiour Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates; which in thoſe times were Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens, Diſcountenancers of and Enemies to the Chriſtian Religion; nevertheleſs it was the will of the Inſpired Apoſtle not only that their Authority ſhould be Subjected to; but alſo that they ſhould be Prayed for in all Chriſtian Congregations.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) The reaſon of it; <hi>That we may lead a Quiet and Peaceable Life in all Godlineſs and Honeſty:</hi> There is a Threefold Peace; Peace with God; In our own Conſciences; And with Men or in Societies, It is this latter that is particularly meant in the words; and I
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:001955_0005_0FBA4196A21737F8"/>
take the other Term, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>Quiet,</hi> to be Syno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimous and to mean the ſame thing: and theſe are abſolutely Neceſſary to the comfort of Life: for though we have a Confluence of all other good things yet if we have not Peace &amp; Quietneſs in the Fruition of them; we ſhall want much of their Comfort, and their Sweetneſs will be very much di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſhed: the Apoſtle adds, <hi>In all Godlineſs and Honeſty,</hi> which ſeems to Limit Peace and Quietneſs to things Sacred, as to the Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of God and the Exerciſe of Religion which are intended in theſe Phraſes, 9. <hi>d.</hi> That we may Worſhip God according to the mind of Chriſt in the Goſpel, and Practice the other Duties of Religion without Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſtation, which they often met with from their Heathen Rulers and from the Jews by their allowance; and doubtleſs the Apoſtle had a particular aim at this and deſired it above all other things: But yet we may ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe that the general meaning of the Apoſtle in this expreſſion was, that they might not be Diſturbed or Diſquieted in any of their Injoyments, and in this Latitude I ſhall take the words.</p>
            <p>The Matter of our Prayers for Kings, and thoſe in Authority is not to be Limited by this clauſe in the Text, for then we ſhould Pray for our ſelves rather than for them, but
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:001955_0006_0FBA41988EB5E650"/>
our Prayers for them ought to be Directed by their Circumſtances and Conditions: The Apoſtle is ſilent as to the Petitions which they were to offer unto God for their Rulers; but we may conclude, that, they being Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thens and Enemies to the Chriſtian Religion, one main &amp; principal thing which they were to Petition for, was, that they might be Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to the Chriſtian Faith, and be made Defenders, Countenancers and Incouragers of their Religion: but we living under a Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Government, and being under Chriſtian Rulers, our Prayers for them muſt be Varied accordingly: but more may be ſaid of this afterwards.</p>
            <p>The Text is Copious and affords Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to all Orders and Degrees of Men.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Civil Rulers</hi> are here Inſtructed in one great End and Deſign of Government, which is the Peace and Quietneſs of thoſe over whom they Rule, and alſo in their Work and Duty; which is the Procurement &amp; Mainte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of their Peace &amp; Quietneſs, that they may lead a Peaceable and Quiet Life under their Government, this is Plainly Suggeſted in the Text.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>The Ruled</hi> are here Inſtructed in their Duty, particularly and expreſly in the great Duty of Prayer to God for their Rulers, that they may be furniſhed to their Work, and be
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:001955_0007_0FBA419A2C559818"/>
made Inſtrumental in bringing about this great end &amp; deſign of Government the Peace &amp; Quietneſs of thoſe over whom they Rule: Theſe are the two Heads which by Divine Aſſiſtance, I ſhall ſpeak to at this Time.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Peace and Quietneſs among Men and in Societies, is one end and deſign of Civil Government, and it is the Work and Duty of all that are In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſted with Civil Power and Authority to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour that all that Live under their Government may have Peace and Quietneſs in all their Injoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments.</hi> This is ſo Plain and Evident that I need not inlarge upon the Proof of it: two things are included in it.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Peace and Quietneſs among Men and in Societies is one end and deſign of Government:</hi> And one of the Principal ends and deſigns of it next unto the Glory of God, which is the ultimate End and Deſign of all things. The Supreme Lord hath Ordained Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and given Kings and Rulers their Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices and their Dignity for this end; that they being Armed with Power and Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty they may Preſerve Publick Peace and Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der in the World: and herein it is that they are Miniſters of God for our good.</p>
            <p>For the Proof of this I ſhall only Inſtance in ſome of the main parts of Government, and ſhew that this is their Principal deſign,
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:001955_0008_0FBA419C372318D8"/>
which will ſufficiently Evince that it is one main end and deſign of the whole.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) This is the deſign of all Humane Laws which contain the Rules of Government, and it ought to be in the Intention of thoſe that have the Power of making them, and alſo of them that are appointed for the Execution of them; they are for the Protection of the Subjects in a Quiet and Peaceable Poſſeſſion of all that God and Nature hath Beſtowed upon them; and they ought to be framed accordingly and ſo Executed: That this end may be attained; that every man may ſit Quietly under his Vine &amp; be undiſturbed in their Injoyments of what kind ſo ever they be.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) This is the end and deſign of all Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations of Juſtice in Civil Courts: they are appointed for the Deciſion of Controver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies among Men: The true Ground or Foundation of Differences and Contentions among Men: or Wrong done either real or ſuppoſed and imaginary: now Civil Courts are appointed to Inquire into all Wrongs and Injuries, and to give Judgment according as they appear, which is to Determine and Iſſue the Controverſies that ariſe there from: So that Peace and Quietneſs is the end and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of the Adminiſtration of Juſtice in Civil Courts.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:001955_0009_0FBA419E206234F8"/>
(3.) This is the Deſign and Intention of many of the Offices that are Conferred in Government; which may be Termed Offices or Commiſſions of the Peace: which Offices do particularly oblige thoſe that ſuſtain them to take care of the Peace &amp; to Improve their Power and Authority, for the Defence and Preſervation of it: and unto ſuch, Perſons are Directed to go for Relief when Unjuſtly Moleſted and Injured: theſe things Argue that this is one of the main ends and deſigns of Government. And we are not to think this too <hi>mean</hi> to be the deſign of ſo Honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble a Calling and Imployment: for Peace and Quietneſs or Undiſturbed Injoyment of our Bleſſings whether Spiritual or Temporal, is the very Life of our Injoyments, and the want of it renders every thing Uncomfortable and Unpleaſant: it is more Eligible to want many other Bleſſings than that of Peace and Quietneſs: <hi>Prov.</hi> 17. 1. <hi>Better is a dry Morſel, and Quietneſs therewith, than a Houſe full of Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices with Strife.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But I Proceed:</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>It is therefore the Work and Duty of all that are Inveſted with Civil Power &amp; Authority to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour after the Attainment of this good and great end of Government:</hi> And all that are Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed in Government, ought to make ſuch an Improvement of their Authority in their
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:001955_0010_0FBA419F4BF829C8"/>
reſpective Poſts, as that thoſe that are under their Government may lead a Quiet and a Peaceable Life: this neceſſarily follows, for ſurely if this be one end of Government, then thoſe that are Imployed in Government ought to look at this and to endeavour after it: But this is evident to all and I need not offer any further Proof of it. I proceed to
The APPLICATION of this Head.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Hence whatſoever in any Government whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther it be Perſon, Office or Law, or any other thing, that croſſes &amp; obſtructs this deſign of Government, it is &amp; muſt be accounted an Evil, and ought to be Suppreſſed.</hi> The Law accounts them ſuch, ſtyling them common Nuſances; and ſuch there are in every Government; and doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs were Strict Inquiſition made, there might be many ſuch things found in this Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which have hither unto Obſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed our Peace and Quietneſs, and Fruſtrated the Attempts that have been made for the Procurement thereof: and ſo long as ſuch things are allowed and connived at Peace can't be expected.</p>

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:001955_0012_0FBA41A260F97B88"/>
all due Reſpect I Intreat that you ſtill uſe your utmoſt endeavours that our <hi>Jeruſalem may be Built a City Compact,</hi> and that it may be <hi>a Quiet and Peaceable Habitation:</hi> This is pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly your Province, and our Eyes are upon you under God for it. It is the Expectation of God whom you Repreſent, and Serve; and of the People over whom you Rule; that you exert all your Power, and Improve all your Wiſdom and Dexterity, your Policy and Prudence for to Reduce us to good Order; that we may be favoured with the Invaluable Bleſſing of Peace and Quietneſs in all our Enjoyments Sacred &amp; Civil. Herein you will Act like Him whom you Repreſent, who has ſtiled Himſelf <hi>the God of Peace;</hi> and is ſo not only as He is the Author of Peace, but alſo as He Loves &amp; Delights in it; and as He has beſtowed His Honourable Name &amp; Character upon you; ſo it becomes you to Anſwer it in your Reſpective Places and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Talents Committed to your Truſt.

            <p>As to our Churches and the Exerciſe of our Religion; we have reaſon to Bow down and to Adore God for the Liberty and Free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:001955_0013_0FBA41A717D24C10"/>
the Peace &amp; Quietneſs we are Indulged with, and in that our Rulers are Chriſtians; Countenancers and Incouragers of Religion; and have made good Laws for the Preſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of our Peace in the Worſhip of God; and in that the ways to our Solemn Aſſemblies don't Mourn: But yet we have reaſon to be Humbled that there has been ſo many Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſions in ſome of our Churches to the great Detriment of Religion and Hindrance to the Work of God in them; and if there might be ſomething farther done for the Prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Feuds and Schiſms in our Churches, it would be very Acceptable unto God and Serviceable to the Intereſt of Chriſt. I ſhall not undertake to Determine the Extent of the Civil Magiſtrates Power in Matters Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtical: it is Evident that there is a care Incumbent upon Civil Rulers of Churches and of Church Matters, and in many Caſes they ought to Exert their Authority: <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. e.</hi> particularly in matters of Order where there are no particular Rules in the Word of God to Oblige the Conſciences of Men to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary; and in things that are left to the Judgment, Prudence and Conduct of Church Officers and Churches. I conceive that the Rules drawn up and agreed upon by them, whether they be for the more Regular and Decent Worſhipping of God or the Exerciſe
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:001955_0014_0FBA41AA9A596068"/>
of Diſcipline, ought to be Eſtabliſhed by the Civil Magiſtrates Authority, and their Sanction ought to be Binding to all; for in ſuch things all ought to Acquieſce in the Judgment of the Churches; and thoſe who Refuſe ought to be Compelled, which would very much Conduce to Peace and Quietneſs in our Churches; which would very much Advantage Religion in them.</p>
            <p>But as to our Civil Affairs; I Preſume that if Property was ſetled upon a better Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it would Contribute much to our Peace and Quietneſs: for many of our Differences, eſpecially in our <hi>New Towns,</hi> ariſe from the Various Sentiments, and Different Opinions there are about it: and it Creates many Uncomfortable Law-Suits, which Excites the Paſſions of men, begets Prejudices in them, and Ingenders Striles and Conten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which brings with them <hi>Confuſion and every Evil Work.</hi> Hereby our Peace is very much Diſturbed and Religion is very much Hurt.</p>
            <p>I ſpeak Feelingly, for Divine Providence has caſt my Habitation in the very midſt of them; not that I am Perſonally Injured or Moleſted; but my meaning is, that I Feel the Hurt that our Contentions does Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and the Intereſt of Men: and I ſhould exceedingly Rejoyce could there <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Remedy to prevent thoſe intolerable Moleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations which ſome men meet with, and the Litigious and Vexatious Law Suits that are Commenced and Carried on to the great Diſturbance of our Peace.</p>
            <p>And if there might be a Cloſer Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on made of the Laws of the Colony to the Troublers of our <hi>Iſrael,</hi> it might be very Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to our Peace and Quietneſs: there are <hi>Achans</hi> among us, who by their Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſions Moleſt us, <hi>Provoke God</hi> and bring down His heavy Judgments upon us <hi>to our Trouble and Confuſion:</hi> theſe Frequently eſcape due Puniſhment, whereby they are Embold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened in their Tranſgreſſions and proceed even to offer Contempt to our Authority and Laws; there are ſome of our Laws which in ſome Places are but rarely if ever put in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution: the end of the Law which is the Peace and Safety of the Subject can't be At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained unleſs it be put in Execution.</p>
            <p>And therefore if there might be great care taken in the Deſignation of Perſons for the Execution of the Laws of the Government; and if ſuch Perſons might be found in every Town, and Impowered for this Service, who are Conſcientious, Men of Courage, Zeal and Reſolution; who are Senſible of the Solemn Nature and Obligation of an Oath and Fear it; and had rather Hazard all, than Offend

GOD or Wrong their own Conſciences, or be Unfaithful in their Places and Stations: it would with the Bleſſing of God Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying their endeavours, exceedingly Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce to our Peace and Quietneſs.</p>
            <p>And if more Care might be taken of our <hi>New Towns,</hi> it might be very Serviceable to them in their Beginning, and prevent their falling into Contentions.</p>
            <p>But to draw to a Cloſe: Let Juſtice have free Courſe in the Government, and let Schools of Learning be Incouraged and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted; this is an Excellent means to Culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate the rough Tempers of thoſe that are growing up, and to inure them to Civility &amp; good Order; which will contribute to our future Peace and Quietneſs.</p>
            <p>And above all things let Religion be Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moted, and endeavour that Godlineſs may be in the midſt of us in the Power of it, and that your Peoples Hearts may be ſeaſoned with the Fear of God and be Eſtabliſhed with the Peaceable Principles of Religion.</p>
            <p>And for this end, Comfort and Incourage the Embaſſadours of Peace, who are Devoted to this Work; I Hope none of us are wanting in our Places, either to forward this work or to be helpful unto you in your endeavours for the Peace and Welfare of this People; by our Prayers, Counſels and Inſtructions;

putting the People in mind to be Subject &amp; Obedient to your Laws &amp; Ordinances.</p>
            <p>And finally, Let me commend to you U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion among your ſelves, as that which will exceedingly ſtrengthen your Authority, and forward your endeavours &amp; attempts for the attaining of our Peace and Quietneſs. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour then to be of one Mind, and at Peace among your ſelves. I paſs on to</p>
            <p>II. <hi>It is the Duty of Chriſtians to Pray for thoſe that have the Rule over them, that they may be Enabled ſo to manage Government, as that Publick Peace and Quietneſs may be Preſerved.</hi> And under this Head, I ſhall 1. Shew that it is a Duty: And 2. What we are to Pray for in order hereunto.</p>
            <p n="1">1. We may Argue this Duty from ſundry Heads, As,</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) From the <hi>Divine Original of Civil Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</hi> It is not an Ordinance of Man, but of God's. <hi>The Powers that be, are of God; whoſoever therefore reſiſteth</hi> them, <hi>reſiſteth</hi> an <hi>Ordinance of God, Rom.</hi> 13. 1, 2. The Original of Government is in God; particular Forms or Modes of Government are of Mans In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting; but the Subſtance of it came from God, and therefore it Depends upon Him for Support and Succeſs: Government can't be Maintained in the World without God who
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:001955_0018_0FBA41B05D35EF90"/>
gave it its being; for the Firſt Cauſe of a thing is neceſſary to its Subſiſtance; neither can there be any good Succeſs of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or any of its good Ends attained un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs its Author Smiles upon it, and His Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing go with it; therefore we ought to Pray to God for thoſe that are Deſigned and Impowred for the Management of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p n="2">(2.) From the <hi>Station and Capacity in which Civil Rulers ſtand in Government.</hi> The High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt in Authority upon Earth are under God. He is the Supreme, and his Power is Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>limited, and he does whatſoever he Pleaſes and gives no Account of his Matters. Men are but Inſtruments in his Hands, and their Offices are only Miniſterial; hence called <hi>Miniſters of God, Rom.</hi> 1<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>. 4. Now Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments depend upon their Efficient Cauſe for Power to Act in their Places and in the Work they are Imployed about. Men have no Power to Act in Government but what they Receive from God. <hi>Joh.</hi> 19. 11. <hi>Jeſus Anſwered, Thou couldeſt have no Power at all againſt me, except it were given thee from above.</hi> It is by Influence &amp; Direction and Aſſiſtance from above that Kings Reign, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8. 15, 16. <hi>By me Kings Reign, and Princes Decree Juſtice. By me Princes Rule, and Nobles, even all the Judges of the Earth:</hi> They Rule their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doms
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:001955_0019_0FBA41B1E1EE5B08"/>
wiſely, juſtly &amp; happily, by My Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel and Aſſiſtance. Therefore we ought to Pray to God for them.</p>
            <p n="3">(3) From the <hi>Abſolute Power and Dominion which God has over the hearts of all men.</hi> They are intirely in his Hands; even the hearts of the higheſt and greateſt upon Earth are at his Command; <hi>Prov.</hi> 21. 1. <hi>The kings heart is in the hand of the Lord, as the rivers of water: He turneth it whitherſoever he will.</hi> He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluences and over-rules the very Inward Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes, Inclinations and Counſels of their Hearts, which ſeem to be moſt in their own Power and out of the way of all others: God can give unto Rulers the Spirit of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, as he gave unto <hi>Saul</hi> another Heart, a Spirit of &amp; Qualification for Government, when He Deſigned and Appointed him for to Rule his People <hi>Iſrael;</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10. 9. Therefore God is to be ſought to for thoſe that Rule over us.</p>
            <p n="4">(4) From the <hi>Neceſſity of Government, and of Perſons very well Accompliſhed for to manage it.</hi> Were it not for Government, the World would ſoon run into all manner of diſorders and confuſions: mens Lives and Eſtates and Liberties would ſoon be a prey to the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous and the Cruel; and we can't expreſs the Ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ice and Murder, the Rapine and Rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beries, the Miſchiefs and Miſeries which
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:001955_0020_0FBA41B35663CBD8"/>
would abound in the World were there no Government to Reſtrain men: One man would be Bread for another, and the World which is like the Sea for Storms &amp; Tempeſts, would alſo Reſemble it in this, that the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants thereof would be as the Fiſhes of the Sea, the great would Devour the ſmall; <hi>Hab.</hi> 1. 14. <hi>As the Fiſhes of the Sea, who have no Rule over them.</hi> We may plainly ſee the Neceſſity of Government in the World, in the Inſtance of ſome, who have thrown off the Reins of Government; &amp; what Uprores have they made? What Outrages and Depre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations have they Committed? taking away the Lives and Eſtates of men at their Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure: and merely for the gratification of their Curſed Luſts; and what the iſſue of this tragical deſign will be, God only knows! This is a convincing Argument of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Government. There is alſo a Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of well Accompliſhed Perſons for the Management of it: The Weight of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is too great to be laid upon the Shoul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of mean men; it is Rulers of the Earth, that under God, uphold it: They are there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore called, <hi>the Pillars of the Earth, Pſal.</hi> 73. 3. This argues, that it is a Duty to Pray for <hi>Civil Rulers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">(5) From the <hi>Difficulties which Attend Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment,</hi> which ariſe principally from the
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:001955_0021_0FBA41B4D4E73DF8"/>
reſtleſs Paſſions and ungoverned Spirits and Luſts of men: Theſe are the prime occaſion of all thoſe Diviſions and Clamours that are in the world; <hi>Jam.</hi> 4. 1: <hi>From whence come Wars and Fightings? Come they not hence, even of your Luſts, that War in your Members?</hi> This renders the Work of thoſe in Government very Difficult; yea Impoſſible for them of themſelves to Quiet and Still the Tumults that are in the world: and to Suppreſs the Diſorders that Sin and the Luſts of men bring into the world. Hence it is in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Aſcribed to Him that has Power to Command the raging Sea and to ſtill the noiſe of its Waves, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 65. 7. <hi>Which ſtilleth the noiſe of their Waves, and the Tumult of the People.</hi> This argues that we ought to Pray to God for our Rulers.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To ſhew what we are to Pray for; or what is to be the Matter of our Prayers for our Rulers. This I ſhall diſpatch in theſe following particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>We are to Pray for their Welfare, Spiritu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and Temporal:</hi> That they may have all ſaving Grace and everlaſting Glory. For their Lives, and all thoſe Bleſſings which are neceſſary to their Comfort &amp; Support; and for their Encouragement, that they may be in a Capacity to undergo and grapple with the Fatigues of Government: and to live
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:001955_0022_0FBA41B8B52CFDC8"/>
anſwerable to the Dignity of their Place and Station in the world; as they are Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed from &amp; exalted above others by the Honour and Dignity that is Conferred upon them, ſo they ought to be in their living: and as their work and ſervice is arduous and difficult, ſo they ought to be Supported and Encouraged. Which we are to Pray for.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>We are to Pray for all good Qualifications for Government;</hi> as a right Heart and Spirit to rule over others, Knowlege and Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, Courage and Fortitude, Patience and the Fear of God, a ſincere &amp; diſintereſted aim at the Glory of God, &amp; the Peace, &amp; Order, and Beauty of the world: Strength &amp; Zeal, and Reſolution for the vigorous Proſecution of theſe ends: Theſe are the gifts of God, &amp; are abſolutely neceſſary for Government: We are therefore to look to God for them: &amp; particularly &amp; eſpecially the Prayer which <hi>Solomon</hi> offered unto God for himſelf, 1 <hi>King.</hi> 3. 9. is very ſuitable for us to offer unto God for our Rulers, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>That God would give them an underſtanding Heart, to Judge his People, that they may diſcern between good and evil.</hi> And alſo that Prayer which he offered unto God, in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 1. 10. <hi>Give me now Wiſdom and Knowlege, that I may go out and come in before this People.</hi>
            </p>

               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:001955_0023_0FBA41BD4AC500F8"/>
(3) <hi>For the Preſence of God with them, the influences of his Spirit &amp; Grace to aſſiſt and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect them, and his Bleſſing upon their Counſels, Deſigns and Undertakings, for the attainment of our Peace, that it may flow in as a River.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>APPLICATION.</p>
            <p n="1">1. Two ſorts of Perſons are to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved.</p>
            <p n="1">(1) <hi>Thoſe who inſtead of Praying for Civil Rulers, Revile 'em &amp; ſpeak Contumeliouſly of them.</hi> This muſt needs be a very great evil, becauſe it is directly contrary to Praying for them: which the Apoſtle in our Text exhorts to, &amp; we have ſhewed is a Chriſtian duty: Which we find alſo ſtrictly forbidden, in <hi>Exod.</hi> 22. 28. <hi>Thou ſhalt not revile the gods, nor curſe the ruler of thy people.</hi> Not gods falſly ſo called, as ſome wou'd have it, but Magiſtrates &amp; Governours, as is evident in the next clauſe, <hi>Nor Curſe the Ruler of thy People.</hi> They are called gods, in <hi>Pſal.</hi> 82. 6. <hi>I have ſaid, Ye are gods,</hi>—It muſt needs therefore be a very great Sin to Revile them, &amp; to ſpeak Evil of them, &amp; an affront unto God whoſe Deputies they are, under whom they Govern, and whoſe Name they bear, which renders it odious &amp; abominable. Hence the Apoſtle <hi>Jude</hi> animadverts upon it as ſuch, and that very ſharply; calling them
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:001955_0024_0FBA41C1E43B5078"/>
               <hi>filthy Dreamers</hi> who <hi>deſpiſe Dominion, and ſpeak evil of Dignities.</hi> And though <hi>Michael the Arch-Angel, when contending with the Devil, durſt not bring a railing accuſation againſt him, Jude</hi> 8, 9. Yet how many are there in theſe days who are hardy and impudent enough, to heap Reproaches and Contume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies on their Rulers, who utter their Reviling and ſcurrilous Speeches, more freely than they do their Prayers for their Rulers; and if they make any Prayers for them, their Practices contradict them, and render them ineffectual.</p>
            <p n="2">(2) <hi>Thoſe who hinder our Peace and Quietneſs, and promote Contentions, are alſo Reprehenſible:</hi> For they act contrary to the duty we have been inſiſting on: and contradict the reaſon of the Apoſtles exhortation in our Text. It is the work of our Rulers to preſerve Peace, and our Duty in the mean time to Pray for them, that they may be Aſſiſted &amp; Directed, Counſelled and Adviſed in this work from above. They that obſtruct our Peace act directly contrary not only to their work, but to their own Duty; which muſt needs be a very great evil and very Offenſive unto God. This is one of the <hi>Six things which the Lord hates,</hi> yea it is <hi>the Seventh which is an Abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to him, Prov.</hi> 6. 19.—<hi>And him that ſow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth Diſcord among Brethren</hi>

2. From hence we may alſo Infer, <hi>the Duties of Reverence, Subjection and Obedience which we owe to our Civil Rulers.</hi> For if we ought to Pray for them, then ſurely we ought to ſhew them the Reſpect and Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence which the Word of God requires and their Station calls for: and alſo to Subject ourſelves to their Authority, and Obey all their lawful Commands. We are alſo here taught that it is our Duty to afford them all that Encouragement, and all that Help we can in their Work: and particularly we ought in our reſpective places to concur with and to forward their deſigns and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours for our Peace and Quietneſs: And if every one would be ready to this, it would make their work very eaſie and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightſom.</p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>In the laſt Place,</hi> I ſhall Commend the Practice of the Duty we have been inſiſting on, 1. To thoſe that are in the Miniſtry. And, 2. To all the People in general.</p>
