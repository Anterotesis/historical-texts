            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. C<hi>Oncerning their Infallibility:</hi> They affirm that they are Infallible, that God hath given to them His Attribute to Know Mens Hearts, and that they are Equal with God.</p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Concerning the Holy Scriptures:</hi> They say that the Scriptures are Humane, and that no Command in them is in it self obliging, that what they speak is of greater Authority than the Holy Scriptures, that the Gospels of St. <hi>Matthew, Mark, Luke</hi> and <hi>John,</hi> are Dust, and the Serpents Meat, <hi>that is the Devils Meat.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. <hi>Concerning the Holy Trinity:</hi> They Damn the Holy Trinity to the Pit of Hell, and call it Conjuration, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firming the Three Persons of God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Ghost are Three Nothings.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Concerning Christ and His Blood:</hi> They utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny that JESUS CHRIST who suffer'd under <hi>Pontius Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late,</hi> was properly the Son of God, or that we are to be saved by His Merits, but affirm that the Light which every Man brings with him into the world, is sufficient
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:001392_0014_0FB2EC77EABEE2E8"/>
for every mans Salvation without any thing else; and that the Blood of Christ is no more than the Blood of any Saint.</p>
            <p n="5">5. <hi>Concerning Baptism and the Lords Supper:</hi> They af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm that Baptism and the Lords Supper are no more Duties to Christians than Circumcision is, which they renounce (<hi>as they say</hi>) by the same Spirit, by which St. <hi>Paul</hi> renounced Circumcision. They call Infant-Baptism the Doctrine of Devils, and the Lords Supper the Table of Devils.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Concerning the Resurrection:</hi> They deny the Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection of the Body after Death, calling that Article of our Faith absurd as the Doctrine of Transubstantiation is.</p>
            <p n="7">7. <hi>Concerning Christs coming to Judgment:</hi> They deny the Article of Christs coming to Judgment at the end of the World, saying, That there will be no other coming of Christ, than what has been already, or that be within Men.</p>
            <p n="8">8. <hi>Concerning Heaven and Hell:</hi> They deny any other Heaven or Hell than what is within men, calling all other Mahometism.</p>
            <p n="9">9. <hi>Concerning the Lords Day, and the Moral Law:</hi> They allow doing servile Work, as opening Shop on the Lords Day, to sell Goods, and Taylers to mend Clothes on that Day; and deny that the Ten Commandments are a Rule to Christians, and especially the Eighth Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandment: for a Quaker said; <hi>He had a Command im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately from Heaven to take away the Priests Hour-glass;</hi> which being complain'd of, <hi>G. Fox</hi> makes this answer, (<hi>Great Mystery,</hi> p. 77.) <hi>And for any being moved of the Lord, to take away your Hour-glass from you; by the Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Power it is Owned.</hi> Note by the same pretence, they may take away the Church Plate, or any thing else:
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:001392_0015_0FB2EC7C86A318C0"/>
For as <hi>E. Burrough</hi> their Prophet saith, <hi>Our</hi> HEIR<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SHIP <hi>it to Possess the uttermost part of the Earth,</hi> in a Declaration of the Quakers signed by <hi>E.

            <p>The Quakers are not wronged in any one Citation, and it is left to the Judgment of all serious Christians, whether these are not the Doctrines which are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in them. All Good Christians are desired to have this Sheet in their Houses, and as they have op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity, to shew the Poor Deluded Quakers their Errors, which 'tis hoped many of them do not know, and will Renounce as soon as they do.</p>
