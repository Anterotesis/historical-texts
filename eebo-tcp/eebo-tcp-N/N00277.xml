            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THe Subject of this following Discourse, now offering it self to thy Perusal is one of the many <gap reason="foreign">
                  <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
               </gap> which it hath pleased the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty Lord of Heaven and of Earth, to treat of and insist upon, in Drawing up and Publishing to the World the great and glorious volume of his Works: in the Margent whereof they have been frequently placed as Red Letters, Asterisms, or pointing Hands, to awaken unto a more heedful attention and serious consideration, the dead heart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed sleeping and secure World of Mankind. To promote this, the best and most blessed end and use, of such tremendous and threatning Aspects of the highest and most Dreadful Majesty, is the pious design of the Reverend and Learned Author, in compiling &amp; publishing this Treatise, &amp; its a thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sand pities it should not be attended to and attained by a People so circumstanced as we, English trans<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into, or procreated in these <hi>American De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sarts,</hi> be. The labour and pains it hath cost the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to peruse and consult so many Writers, ancient &amp; modern, <hi>Astronomers, Chronologers<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> &amp; Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storians,
<pb facs="unknown:000352_0003_0FA4AD94B7BCA188"/>
is such as will render it very disingenious, not to give it a graceful and friendly reception and entertainment. He hath therein presented thee with, <hi>first,</hi> the <hi>Theory; secondly,</hi> the <hi>History</hi> of <hi>Comets,</hi> commonly called <hi>Blazing Stars.</hi> As to the <hi>Theory,</hi> there is (to my understanding) as much declared, as it hath pleased the Father of Lights and Fountain of all knowledge &amp; wisdome (hitherto) to discover to poor ignorant Mortals; <hi>viz.</hi> the result of the judicious thoughts of the ablest and best accomplished <hi>Artists,</hi> who upon very ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny accurate, unquestionably true and exact Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations, made by the help of choicest Instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments improved by minds intensely set to search into, and find out the Mystery and Meaning of those abstruse and admirable works of him who is most High; have declared what they conceive most rationally probable. The wisest of Men know that they understand but little part of Gods wayes and works; and are not ashamed to confess that in so much things above humane Capacity, they are ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther <hi>Quaerists</hi> then <hi>Adeptists,</hi> content to be igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of what he is pleased as yet not to discover; our <hi>Authors</hi> modest expressing himself, sheweth he wrote under the influence of so humbling a conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:000352_0004_0FA4AD96369BDFA8"/>Of the second, or <hi>Historical</hi> part of the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, the scope is, to evidence and evince that <hi>Comets</hi> are ordinarily the forerunners of disaste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous Calamities, Mischiefs, &amp; Miseries, hastning to follow and fall down on the heads of senseless &amp; secure Sinners. For the clearing up and making out of which, by way of induction, a great multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of particular Instances and Examples are out of sundry <hi>Authors</hi> of approved ability and faithfulness alledged; who have left upon Record their accurate observations of time, place, and o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther circumstances of several <hi>Comets</hi> in divers ages, with the dreadful Revolutions, dismal Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>motions and Confusions which followed them at the heels. If it be said, that some of those <hi>Peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wigged Heraulds</hi> have appeared on the <hi>aethereal stage</hi> upon a more benign account: it may be ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionally replied, that the number of such is very small: and that their <hi>blasting influences,</hi> might be direfully operative in remoter and less known parts of the Earth. When the hand of Heaven is seen writing <hi>MENE MENE TEKEL,</hi> &amp;c. it may become the highest of Mortals to tremble. <hi>Reader,</hi> if thou art one any whit considerably rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed above the level of the lowest sort of men, thou wilt not think it lost labour to acquaint thy self
<pb facs="unknown:000352_0005_0FA4AD96E85689C0"/>
with what is here presented: an awakening and humbling is the best use thou canst make of it; to see it improved unto the furthering thy souls best good will be the most acceptable recompense of the Pious <hi>Authors</hi> unwearied pains: That he may see the desired travel of his soul, shall be the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned wish, of him who is,</p>

            <p>SOme Worthy Persons having desired me to Write the History of Comets; I resolved (with Divine Permission and Assistance) to spend the spare hours of a few Weeks in an endeavour that way. And accordingly I have pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rused what Books I could meet with, which might be helpful to me in this undertaking.

Also <hi>Erasmus Bartholinus</hi> hath written upon those Comets, which Books, I have very much wish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for a sight of, as supposing I should meet with Passages therein, that would be serviceable to me in my present design: But I could not at this distance from <hi>Europe,</hi> suddenly obtain them.</p>
            <p>As for what concerns the <hi>Time,</hi> and other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances
<pb facs="unknown:000352_0007_0FA4AD9B2E2D78E0"/>
relating to these <hi>Phaenomenus</hi>; I have been chiefly beholding to the Collections of <hi>Alste<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dius, Longomontanus, Kepler, Hevelius</hi> and <hi>Ricciolus</hi> Though <hi>Rockenbachius</hi> is many times cited, I could not obtain the perusal of his Book (it not being in this <hi>American</hi> Wilderness) only I take his Obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations upon trust from <hi>Hevelius,</hi> who hath faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully expressed what the other hath written. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning remarkable <hi>Events:</hi> Besides the Authors mentioned<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have consulted <hi>Funccius, Calvisius<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Cluverius,</hi> and several other Historians; and if the <hi>Reader</hi> please to take the pains to search the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors quoted in the Margin, or where none is there cited, if he look into <hi>Calvisius</hi> and <hi>Funccius</hi> their Chronologies he will find that things have been truly related. As for Events which have hapned in these late times, it is needless to quote any Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, for that which our own eyes have seen, or ears heard. I know (as the great <hi>Orator</hi> could say) I am not born for my self, but for others<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I may hope that my labour herein, will not be altogether unacceptable to the <hi>English Reader,</hi> since there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver was yet (so far as I understand) an attempt of this kind by an <hi>English</hi> hand. My chief design, is to inform and edifie the ordinary sort of <hi>Readers.</hi> Yet considering that God hath made me a debter to the wise as well as to the weak, I have added some things of the <hi>nature, place<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> motion of Comets,</hi> which only such as have some skill in <hi>Astronomy</hi> can understand; and unto such, hints of that kind will

               <head>CHAP. I. That Comets are not in the Air, but in the Starry Heaven. Their Origin and true matter enquired into.</head>
               <p>THe Sentiments of learned Men, concerning the place where and the matter out of which <hi>Comets</hi> are made; have been very various. The <hi>Peripa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tetick School</hi> has phansied them to be <hi>Meteors,</hi> generated out of the Bowels of the Earth, exhaled and extolled by the Sun to the supream Region of the Air, and there set on Fire. It would be needless and endless to tell how ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny have after <hi>Aristotle</hi> embraced this fiction, but it may not be unprofitable in a few words to evince the contrary, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>Comets</hi> are not placed in the <hi>first</hi> heaven or Air, but farr above
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:000352_0012_0FA4AD9F7A970600"/>
it, in the <hi>second</hi> or <hi>Starry Heaven,</hi> and that therefore they are rather <hi>Stars</hi> than <hi>Meteors.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. That most learned Mathematici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an <hi>Hevelius</hi> his argument from the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of <hi>Comets</hi> is irrefragable <note n="a" place="margin">

But this is true of every <hi>Comet</hi>; its diurnal or common mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, is absolved as other Caelestial bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies are, which cannot be said of any sort of <hi>Meteors</hi>; yea, the motion there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of is exact and regular, though at first its more swift, and afterwards more slow, yet in that inequality, there is an exact proportion and regularity obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, when as it is otherwise with <hi>Meteors</hi> that are tossed to and fro, and move not through the great Circle. The motion of <hi>Comets</hi> doth very much imitate not that of the <hi>fixed Stars,</hi> but of the <hi>Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets,</hi> whence they are by some called <hi>Pseudo-Planetae</hi>

Under this comes that which is called <hi>Acontias,</hi> when the blaze is in the form of a Dart. <hi>Longitis,</hi> when it is in the form of a Lance or Spear. <hi>Xiphias,</hi> when in the form of a Sword. <hi>Cere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias</hi> when it bends like a crooked Horn. <hi>Lampadias,</hi> when it blazeth like a Lamp.

next to the Sun, but which is opposite there from. Some antient Writers be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan a little to take notice of this. But <hi>Appianus</hi> was the first that did fully and clearly discern it to be so, being con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the truth of this notion, by five several Comets which himself lived to see, <hi>viz.</hi> Those in <hi>Anno.</hi> 1531, 32, 33, 38, 39.

                  <hi>Longomontanus</hi> observeth, that if the Comet have a more lateral disposition towards the Sun, then it will be <hi>Cauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tus,</hi> but if the opposition to the Sun be more direct, or the Comet elevated a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove the Sun, then it will be <hi>Crinite,</hi> or the Blaze but short. The blaze is long or short according to the opposition to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Sun, and distance from the Earth. The blaze of some Comets hath extended it self above ninety De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees. There was one in <hi>Aristotle</hi>'s time that was an 130 Degrees in Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitude. If the Comet be higher then the Sun, the blaze will be short. If the Comet be as low as the Sun, then
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:000352_0026_0FA4ADAE8ED04068"/>
the nearer it is to the Sun, the longer will the blaze appear to be. By the things that have been thus far discour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, we may conclude that the time of any Comets appearance cannot certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly be praedicted before hand.

                  <hi>Verulam</hi>) have suppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed that this knowledge is attainable.

Yet I will not deny, but that a <hi>probable conjecture,</hi> as to the year of a Comets appearance, may be made from the conjunction of the superiour Planets. It hath been <note n="w" place="margin">Franciscus Junctinus <hi>in Annotationibus de Cometis</hi> Cornelius Gemma <hi>Cos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mogr.</hi> L. 1 C. 18</note> observed that those rare Conjunctions are commonly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the appearance of some <hi>new Star,</hi> or <hi>Comet:</hi> So indeed it was as to the <hi>Blazing Stars</hi> in 1504, 1506, 1525, 1577, 1583. 1664. notable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions of the Planets did praecede them. Upon this ground,<note n="x" place="margin">Edlin <hi>in his praenuncius sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereus</hi> Pag. 36 37, 89.</note> a late <hi>Astrologer,</hi> publishing a Treatise of the conjunction of <hi>Saturn</hi> and <hi>Jupiter</hi>

Anno. 1663. conjectured that a Comet would appear the next year: which hapned to be true; and if an <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strologer</hi> (as the blind man hits the mark) chance to praedict right once, more notice is taken of that, then of his mistaking an hundred times over. Very notable Conjunctions of the Pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nets hapned this present, and will do so again the next year, (as shall be more particularly mentioned) If any man should now positively affirm, that within this twelve moneth another <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Star</hi> will appear, it would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sumptuous, although it is both possible and probable that it may so come to pass. But the observation doth not alwayes hold good; For there have been both greater and lesser Conjun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctions of the Planets, when no Comet hath appeared, and many Comets with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any such Conjunctions immediately praeceding. In few words, sometimes, many <hi>Blazing Stars</hi> have been seen within the compass of a few years; there have been at least ten within these eighty years last past. But in some a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, not one Comet hath appeared for an hundred years together. Since se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral may appear (in two, nay) in one year, and it may be not one in fifty nor
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:000352_0028_0FA4ADAFAA2B4DA8"/>
in an hundred years, the appearance of such <hi>Phaenomena</hi>'s, cannot be infallibly foreseen by any humane understanding upon Earth.</p>
               <p>There are who think, that inasmuch as Comets may be supposed to proceed from natural causes, there is no <hi>speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing voice of Heaven</hi> in them, beyond what is to be said of all other works of God.

remarkable Commotions in this lower World, as is commonly observed &amp; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved by Learned Men, &amp; may further be declared in the close of this Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course. The like is to be said of nota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Eclipses of the Luminaries in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.

Nevertheless, whoso reads <hi>Calvisius</hi> and other Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nologers, will perhaps think that such a notion is not wholly to be slighted. Chronologers observe that in the very Year when the ten Tribes were carried into Captivity, there hapned a great Eclipse of the Sun, which came not to pass without a special hand of divine providence; unto this the Prophet seemeth to allude, <hi>Amos</hi> 8.9. That <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clipse</hi> was ominous of a <hi>Dark Day</hi> coming upon <hi>Samaria.</hi> Many notable Instances might be produced to this purpose. And something hath been observed among our selves, which seems to confirm their Opinion, who believe that <hi>total</hi> and <hi>central Eclipses,</hi> are ominous of mutations where they happen. There was such an <hi>Eclipse</hi>

of the Sun in <hi>New England</hi> (Aug. 12. A.

Moneth of <hi>March</hi> a terrible Blazing Star was seen, both preceding and following the Sun every day, which caused many in those dayes to think that there were two Comets at the same time.

The Empire was put into a strange hurly burly. For the Emperour had no less then seven Armies to defend himself. The Pope and He were at daggers drawing; the

Pope resolving to call a Council of such as liked him best, whether the Emperour would or no; He (<hi>i. e.</hi>) the Emperour) surprized the Bishops Navy as they were transporting themselves to the Council, sunk three of their Ships. took twenty of them, and the Bishops in them became his Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>soners.

The Emperour and the Pope being at variance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Emperour died suddenly, not without suspicion of Poyson by the Popes procurement. The Pope himself died within a year.

               <p>A. D. 1577. This year a notable blazing Star amazed the VVorld for three Moneths together. Those famous Mathematicians <hi>Michael Mastlin, Cornelius Gemma,</hi> and <hi>Tycho Brahe,</hi> have written
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:000352_0112_0FA4AE3C115D30C0"/>
largely and learnedly concerning that Comet. It was seen first on the ninth of <hi>November,</hi> in the beginning of <hi>Capricorn,</hi> passing through that sign and <hi>Aquarius,</hi> to the midst of <hi>Pisces.</hi> The Star was equal to <hi>Venus</hi> in magnitude, being a compact solid body<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and like a little Moon, shi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning as the purest Silver. The stream differed in colour from the Star, for it was red and fiery, in breadth five Degrees, and in length thirty. To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the body of the Star, the rayes were more condensed, but the longer they were distended they appeared to be more scattered and diffused abroad, which argued that the Stream was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>created by some external light penetrating through the body of the Star; and it was obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to be opposite to the Sun, yet so as that the form of it was bending like a Bow, whose con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vexity was towards the Zenith, and concavity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>Horizon.</hi> Both <hi>Gemma</hi> and <hi>Tycho</hi> found that this Comet was higher then the Moon. According to <hi>Tycho's</hi> observation, the true Dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meter of the Star was 368. <hi>Mill. Germ.</hi> so that its proportion to the Earth was as 3 to 14. The Longitude of the Comets tail he found to be 96 Semidiameters of the Earth. He concluded it was not in the Airy but in the <hi>Etherial</hi> VVorld, because it did admit of no sensible Parallax. On <hi>November</hi> 10. the Parallax was 19 12 which was diminished every day until it came to two minutes, and that was a demonstration that the
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:000352_0113_0FA4AE3CC4CF6A30"/>
Comet ascended higher and higher. At the first it was distant from the Earth 173 Semidiamiters, but at last 1733. <hi>h. e.</hi> it ascended as high as the Sun it self. As for Events, the King of <hi>Persia</hi> died by poyson. The great Turk was slain in Battel, and seventy thousand with him. The King of <hi>Por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugal</hi> would needs venture into <hi>Mauritaniae</hi> that so he might restore <hi>Mahomed</hi> to the Kingdome which his Uncle <hi>Abdelmeleck</hi> had detruded him from; in that memorable Battel the King of <hi>Portugal</hi> was slain, and the greatest part of the Nobility with him. <hi>Abdelmeleck</hi> though he ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a victory died that day of an Apoplexy. <hi>Mahomed</hi> was drowned in the Marshes, so that three Kings lost their lives in one day.

               <p>A.D. 1618. This year is famous for Blazing Stars, inasmuch as therein no less then four <hi>Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets</hi> were observed.

The Star was hardly perceivable in <hi>Europe</hi> by reason of its vicinity to the Sun, but in <hi>Persia,</hi> and in the <hi>East-Indies</hi> (though not in <hi>Europe</hi>) continuing from <hi>November</hi> 22<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember</hi> 13. The fourth and last Comet appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this year, was that which all the Earth looked upon with astonishment. It was first taken notice of <hi>November</hi> 24. and continued to <hi>January</hi> 24. <hi>h.e.</hi> for the space of 60 dayes. There are some now living who remember this blazing Star. But I find a far other kind of Description given of it, in the Books of those learned Mathematicians,

The body of the Comet was to appearance big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger then a Star of the first magnitude, and would sometimes seem to twinkle. <hi>Wendeline, Cusatus</hi> and others that viewed it with a <hi>Telescope,</hi> did to their admiration observe a little Nut or Star in the body of this Comet; after that it was broken into three Stars like Coals of fire in a flaming Oven, after that into a multitude of little Stars which could not be numbred because they would sometimes sparkle out, and otherwhile abscond from the eye. The blaze was narrow near the Star, but broad at a distance from it. At its first appearance it bended like a Bow, but afterwards it appeared straight. The Colour of the Blaze near the Star was red and fiery, but towards the end of it white and pale, very much resembling the <hi>Via Lactea.

The form of the Comet was not exactly round, but seemed to be rough and broken, and in some places point<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out more then in other places. As for the true magnitude of the Comet, it was at first about six times as big as the Earth, after it was diminish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in <hi>January,</hi> it was again augmented in <hi>Februa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry.</hi> It did not alwayes keep the same distance from the Earth.

In the midst of the Comets head one might with a <hi>Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lescope</hi> discern one <hi>Nucleus</hi> or Star very lucid and shining like Gold, which was encompassed with a more dilute matter. The <hi>Blaze</hi> proceeding therefrom was almost as thick as the matter in
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:000352_0127_0FA4AE4CB48DDF68"/>
which the <hi>Nucleus</hi> was contained. <hi>April</hi> 8. it appeared very lucid, so that one might perceive the Comet after the other Stars disappeared, the <hi>Nucleus</hi> not much altered from what it was at first <hi>April</hi> 16. the Comet seemed brighter then any of the fixed Stars, yea to outshine <hi>Saturn</hi>; then by the help of the <hi>Telescope</hi> one might discern the <hi>Nucleus</hi> to be more bright and bigger then be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore. The <hi>Diameter</hi> of the <hi>Nucleus</hi> was less then <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s, but equal to <hi>Saturn</hi>'s, whence one might conclude that the Comet was as yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creasing. The <hi>Nucleus</hi> seemed to cast a notable shadow on that side which was a verse to the Sun. For the blaze seemed to be divided, the reason of which might be because the <hi>Nucleus</hi> was so com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact and solid, that the beams of the Sun could not pass through it, only through the thin matter which was on both sides of it. The matter on the fore part of the <hi>Nucleus</hi> as the Comet came nearer to the Sun<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> appeared to be more acumina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted and diminished. The <hi>Parallax</hi> of this Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met was at first 69 <hi>sec.</hi> at last 41. <hi>sec.</hi> The mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitude of the <hi>Nucleus</hi> was 12. <hi>sec.</hi> and of the whole head of the Comet 6. <hi>min.</hi> so that when nearest to the Earth, it was sixty times as high as the Moon, and at last as high as the Sun. The blaze was 17. sometimes 25. Degrees as to its visible Longitude. The motion of this Comet was direct according to the order of the signs, at first appearing in <hi>Pisces,</hi> and at last in <hi>Taurus.</hi> It

               <p>As for remarkable Events attending these <hi>Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Stars,</hi> we cannot but remember what doleful things quickly followed. An unhappy War be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween two <hi>professing Nations,</hi> viz. the <hi>English</hi> and the <hi>Dutch,</hi> whereby much Christian and Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stant blood was shed.

The next year the <hi>Papists</hi> set <hi>London</hi> on fire; which dreadful Conflagration continued for several dayes, until eighty seven Parishes were consumed by those fatal flames. The smoak of that burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing caused the Sun to look as if it were turned into darkness, and the Moon into blood.

Also several places in <hi>Europe</hi> were affrighted with Earth-quakes this year: particularly <hi>Constantinople,</hi> and <hi>Adrianople,</hi> but especially <hi>Raguse</hi> which was in a great part destroyed. Also the Plague broke out, in the chief City of the <hi>European Tartary</hi>; and in great <hi>Poland,</hi> and in <hi>Paccardy,</hi> it raged in <hi>Donay, Ghent</hi> and other places. A fire in <hi>Moscow</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed thirty thousand Houses, and five hundred <hi>Churches</hi> and <hi>Chappels</hi>; a great part of the Cities of <hi>Gottenbourg,</hi> and <hi>Stetin,</hi> were this year also consumed by fire.

It was before observed, that <hi>Hamans</hi> bloody Conspiracy to cut off the Lords People, was attended with a Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Star. And why might not this Combination of the <hi>Antichristian</hi> party (which was worse then that of <hi>Hamans</hi>) be so too? Now as the Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery of <hi>Haman</hi> (who was a Type of <hi>Anti-Christ</hi>) his wicked contrivance, ended in the ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter destruction of himself, and of his Children; So the Lord grant that the revealing of this Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pish Plot may issue in the ruine of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and of those that do uphold him; and let every Man that fears God, or that bears any love to his Name and Truth, say<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

the Ingenious Mr. <hi>John Foster,</hi> the late Printer in <hi>Boston</hi> in <hi>New-England.</hi> And though he be gone (not without a publick loss by his death and the sorrow of many) it being mentioned amongst evil <hi>Omens,</hi> that the cunning Artificer shall be taken away) he hath left behind him, some of his Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations concerning this Comet.

Its <hi>Blaze</hi> appeared very red and fiery, extending as far as the breast of the <hi>Swan. Dec.</hi> 14. its head was first discerned, the Blaze passing to the North-ward of <hi>Cor Aquilae.

               <p>As for Remarkable Events, attending this Bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing Star, We that live in <hi>America</hi> know but little of the great Motions in <hi>Europe,</hi> much less in <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frica</hi> and <hi>Asia,</hi> until a long time afterwards. On<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly we are informed of some considerable Commo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions the last year, between the <hi>Tartars</hi> and the <hi>Chineses.</hi> Likewise in <hi>Hungaria,</hi> some things worthy of Remark have hapned. Above four hundred Villages in that Countrey have lately been laid desolate by Sword and Fire. The <hi>Turks</hi> have an Army on foot there, and it is strange to consider (only God maketh the Earth to help the Woman) that those Barbarous Infidels, should declare unto the Emperour of <hi>Germany,</hi> that they will not be at peace with him, except he do's restore unto the oppressed <hi>Protestants</hi> their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and estates which have been unjustly taken

from them. The Pope has disposed of the Ecclesi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>astical 10<hi>th.</hi> in the State <hi>Millan</hi> to be imployed in a war against the <hi>Hungarian</hi> Protestants. This last Summer the Protestants (commonly called <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bels</hi>) in those parts have had Wonderful succes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses against the Popish Generation. It is possible this may be a <hi>beginning of Revenges upon the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my.</hi> The great expectation, is, that the next year the <hi>Grand Signior</hi> will come in person against the Emperour, with the most formidable Army which hath been known in the World for these many a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges.

It is said that those Provinces suffered more by that Inundation, then by all the <hi>French</hi> Wars which of late have been so heavy upon them. The poor Protestants in <hi>France,</hi> are blazing in a flame of Persecution. The <hi>French KING</hi> in his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claration newly come forth, boasts that he hath caused several Millions of Protestants to forsake their holy Profession, and to turn <hi>Roman Catho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks</hi>; He also and the Pope are quarelling who shall be Pope in <hi>France.</hi> Yea his hand seems to be against every one, and every mans against him,

the issue whereof must needs in probability be some great overturnings and alteration of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent State of Affairs in <hi>Europe.</hi> And besides these particulars (which are considerable) other things have come to pass in <hi>Europe</hi> since the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>met last mentioned, which deserve to have a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark set upon them. For the last year there was a terrible conflagration in <hi>Moscow</hi> (it begun in a Stable) whereby four thousand Houses were consumed, and turned into ruinous heaps. And this last Summer the great City of <hi>Plesco,</hi> is made desolate by fire, not above seventy Houses remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. Also the <hi>Czar</hi> (or <hi>Emperour</hi>) of <hi>Musco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via</hi> is lately dead; and his Death hath occasioned a very great Commotion about a Successour to the Crown. At first his Brother was Proclaimed; but the City of <hi>Mosco</hi> rose up in Arms about it, and the Souldiers there have lately made a dismal slaughter amongst the Nobility and chief Citizens, deposing the late <hi>Czar</hi>'s Brother, and setting up his Uncle as Emperour in his stead. For three dayes together (<hi>viz.</hi> 15, 16, &amp; 17 of <hi>May</hi> last) things in that great and imperial City, were in the strangest Confusion imaginable; on the seventh day of <hi>June</hi> last, a terrible <hi>Earth-quake</hi> hapned in that part of the World, continuing for the space of half an hour, whereby many stately Fabricks were thrown down to the ground, and an hundred lives destroyed by their fall. Moreover this last Summer, God hath opened the Windows of Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven

in a very awful manner, so as that the Floods occasioned by the great Rains, have destroyed many Towns in <hi>Sicily.</hi> We hear that Mount <hi>Aetna</hi> (which has been wont to vomit Fire) has of late cast out such an abundance of Water, as that the Neighbouring Countrey is drowned thereby. We hear also, that on the sixth day of <hi>June</hi> last, a most prodigious Tempest hapned in <hi>Sicily,</hi> whereby the Town of <hi>Randazzo, Franca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville,</hi> and <hi>Tortorica</hi> became subject to a sudden and unexpected ruin. About half an hour before Sun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>set, there hapned so great a darkness, as that no object could be distinguished at the distance of four paces; after which there arose an amazing Storm of Rain, Thunder and Lightning<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> which lasted for thirty six hours. About one of the clock in the Morning, great Torrents fell upon the Neighbouring Mountains, with such irresist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able fury, as that Trees of extraordinary bigness were carried away before them, which coming a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst <hi>Tortorica</hi> threw down the Walls and Hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses thereof, 600. of the Inhabitants were drowned.

               <p>A.D. 1682. It is reported that in <hi>Germany</hi> a Blazing Star was seen <hi>June</hi> 17. in the South-west, which continued visible for the space of an hour, and was then obscured by the rising of the Sun. If that Relation be true, there have been two Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mets (or one hath twice appeared) this present year. For it is certain that there was one visible in <hi>August</hi> last. Some had a sight of it <hi>August</hi> 15. for my own part, I saw it not until <hi>August</hi> 18. 3. <hi>h.</hi> A.M when it was in the foreclaw of <hi>Vrsa major.</hi> The stream about 10.

It was then perceived by us in <hi>N.E.</hi> only in the morning, whenas I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed by Letters from <hi>London,</hi>that they saw it in the Evening the same night when we beheld it in the morning only.

I had not an opportunity to view it with a <hi>Telescope</hi> above once (and that was <hi>Sept.</hi> 12.) through which it appeared to be a very dim and hazy kind of body.

               <p>There is an Anonymous Astrologer in <hi>London</hi> (some of whose Notions are taken out of <hi>Gadbu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries</hi> Book of Comets, Printed <hi>Anno</hi> 1665.) that has published his Sentiments upon this Comet; presumptuously determining not only what the Events are which shall attend this, with the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Blazing Stars, but the places, yea and persons concerned therein. No man of wisdome and judgement can relish the boldness of such a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phet after; Especially considering that he does praedict things that are contrary to the Scriptures of Truth. He prophesies of the <hi>Turks</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version, and consequently Salvation; when as the sure Word of Prophesie unto which we shall do well to give heed, informs us that the <hi>Turk</hi> shall come to his end, and there shall be none to help him, <hi>Numb.</hi> 24.24. <hi>Dan.</hi> 11.45. <hi>Rev.</hi> 9.15.

that the true Planets and fixed Stars have a natural influence into such things, though the manner of their operation is by us silly Mortals undeclarable. <hi>Gen.</hi> 1.14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 33.13, 14. <hi>Judg.</hi> 5.20. <hi>Job</hi> 38.31, 32, 33.

The light which the Moon recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veth from the Sun hath a physical and wonderful influence upon the Earth, so may the Beams which blaze through a Cometical body have likewise.

The weightiest ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection against the inference which we adhere un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to, is, That there have been some happy Comets, and that the evils pretended to follow after them, have sometimes hapned when no Comet hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

in the same sign, the one in the next Moneth, <hi>viz.</hi> on the thirtieth of <hi>Ianuary,</hi> in the 18.

As for those great Conjunctions of all the Planets which hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen but once in 794. years, there have been but seven of them since the World begun. The se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond of which was attended with <hi>Noah</hi>'s Flood.

A Learned and Judicious Author <note n="h" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Alstedius</hi> in Chronol.

But besides these general ones, there are particular Conjunctions of the two Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>periour Planets, which meet together once in (about) 20 years, and use to continue in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction, until <hi>Mars</hi> come and joyn with them; and then it is admirable to behold three great Stars shining in the same sign in the Heavens<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any scintillation, <note n="*" place="bottom">v <hi>Kepler</hi> Epit.
