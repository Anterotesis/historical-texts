            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>The PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <hi>THE world is already full of books; and the people of God are abundantly furniſhed with excellent books upon divine ſubjects; and, it ſeems, that every ſubject has been writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten upon over &amp; over again: and the people in very deed have had precept upon precept, line upon line, here a little and there a little; and ſo in the whole, they have much, yea, very much they have enough and more than enough. And when I come to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider theſe things, I am ready to ſay with myſelf, What folly and madneſs is it in me to ſuffer any thing of mine to appear in print, to expoſe my ignorance to the world.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It ſeems altogether unlikely that my performance will do any manner of ſervice in the world, ſince the moſt excellent writings of worthy and learned men are diſregarded. But there are two or three conſiderations that have induced me to be willing, to ſuffer my broken hints to appear in the world. One is, that the books that are in the world are written in very high and refined lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, and the ſermons that are delivered every ſabbath in general, are in a very high and lofty ſtile, ſo that the common people underſtand but little of them. But I think they can't help underſtanding my talk; it is common, plain, every day talk: little children may underſtand me. And poor Negroes <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> and fully underſtand my meaning, and it may be of ſervice to them. Again, it may in a particular manner be ſerviceable to my poor kindred, the Indians. Further, as it comes from an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common quarter, it may induce people to read it, becauſe it is from an Indian. Laſtly, God works where and when he <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap> and by what inſtruments he ſees fit, and he can and has uſed weak and unlikely inſtruments to bring about his great work.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>It was a ſtormy and very uncomfortable day, when the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing diſcourſe was delivered, and about one half of it was not delivered, as it was written, and now it is a little altered and enlarged in ſome places.</hi>

            <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
            <p>BY the melancholy providence of God, and at the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt deſire and invitation of the poor condemned cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal, I am here before this great concourſe of people at this time, to give the laſt diſcourſe to the poor miſerable object who is to be executed this day before your eyes, for the due reward of his folly and madneſs, and enormous wickedneſs. It is an unwelcome taſk to me to ſpeak upon ſuch an occaſion; but ſince it is the deſire of the poor man himſelf, who is to die a ſhameful death this day, in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience I cannot deny him; I muſt endeavour to do the great work the dying man requeſts.</p>
            <p>I conclude that this great concourſe of people have come together to ſee the execution of juſtice upon this poor In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian; and I ſuppoſe the bigeſt part of you look upon your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves chriſtians, and as ſuch I hope you will demean your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; and that you will have ſuitable commiſeration to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards this poor object. Tho' you can't in juſtice pray for his life to be continued in this world, yet you can pray ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly for the ſalvation of his poor ſoul, conſiſtently with the mind of God. Let this be therefore, the fervent exerciſe of our ſouls: for this is the laſt day we have to pray for him. As for you, that don't regard religion, it cannot be expected, that you will put up one petition for this miſerable creature: yet I would intreat you ſeriouſly to conſider the frailty of corrupt nature, and behave yourſelves as becomes rational creatures.</p>
            <p>And in a word, let us all be ſuitably affected with the melancholy occaſion of the day, knowing that we are all dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing creatures, and accountable unto God. Tho' this poor condemned criminal will in a few minutes know more than all of us, either in unutterable joy, or in inconceivable wo, yet we ſhall certainly know as much as he, in a few days.</p>

            <head>The ſacred words that I have choſen to ſpeak from upon this undeſirable occaſion, are found written in the epiſtle of St. Paul to the</head>

               <q>For the wages of ſin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life through Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>DEATH is called the King of Terrors, and it ought to be the ſubject of every man and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man's thoughts daily; becauſe it is that unto which they are liable every moment of their lives: and therefore, it cannot be unſeaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to think, ſpeak and hear of it at any time, and eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally on this mournful occaſion; for we muſt all come to it, how ſoon we cannot tell; whether we are prepared or not prepared, ready or not ready, whether death is welcome or not welcome, we muſt feel the force of it: whether we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern ourſelves with death or not, it will concern itſelf with us. Seeing that this is the caſe with every one of us, what man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of perſons ought we to be in all holy converſation and godlineſs; how ought men to exert themſelves in prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for death continually; for they know not what a day or an hour may bring forth, with reſpect to them. But, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> according to the appearance of mankind in general,
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:012494_0004_0F8A901D938350C8"/>
death is the leaſt thought of. They go on from day to day, as if they were to live here forever, as if this was the only life. They contrive, rack their inventions, diſturb their reſt, and even hazard their lives in all manner of dangers, both by ſea and land; yea they leave no ſtone unturn'd that they may live in the world, and at the ſame time have little or no contrivance to die well: God and their ſouls are neglected, and heaven and eternal happineſs are diſregard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; Chriſt and his religion are deſpiſed—yet moſt of theſe very men intend to be happy when they come to die, not conſidering that there muſt be great preparation in order to die well. Yea there is none ſo fit to live as thoſe that are fit to die; thoſe that are not fit to die are not fit to live. Life &amp; death are nearly connected; we generally own that it is a great and ſolemn thing to die. If this be true, then it is a great and ſolemn thing to live; for as we live, ſo we ſhall die. But I ſay again, how little do mankind realize theſe things? They are buſy about the things of this world as if there was no death before them. Dr. <hi>Watts</hi> pictures them out to the life in his pſalms:

            </p>
            <p>But on the other hand, life is the moſt precious thing and ought to be the moſt deſired by all rational creatures. It ought to be prized above all things; yet there is nothing ſo abuſed and deſpiſed as life, and nothing ſo neglected: mean eternal life is ſhamefully diſregarded by men in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, and eternal death is choſen rather than life. This
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:012494_0004_0F8A901D938350C8"/>
the general complaint of the bible from the beginning to the end. As long as Chriſt is neglected, life is refuſed, and as long as ſin is cheriſhed, death is choſen; and this ſeems to be the woful caſe of mankind of all nations, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to their appearance in theſe days; for it is too plain to be denied, that vice and immorality, and floods of ini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quity are abounding every where amongſt all nations, and all orders and ranks of men, and in every ſect of people. Yea there is a great agreement and harmony among all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and from the higheſt to the loweſt to practiſe ſin and iniquity; and the pure religion of Jeſus Chriſt is turned out of doors, and is dying without; or, in other words, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt is turned out of doors by men in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and even by his profeſſed people. "He came to his own, and his own received him not." But the devil is ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, he has free acceſs to the houſes and hearts of the children of men: Thus life is refuſed and death is choſen. But in further ſpeaking upon our text, by divine aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
               <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ce, I ſhall conſider theſe two general propoſitions:</p>
            <p>I. That ſin is the cauſe of all the miſeries that befal the children of men, both as to their bodies and ſouls, for time and eternity.</p>
            <p>II. That eternal life and happineſs is the free gift of God, thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
            <p>In ſpeaking to the firſt propoſition I ſhall firſt conſider the nature of ſin; and ſecondly ſhall conſider the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of ſin, or the wages of ſin, which is death.</p>
            <p>Firſt then, we are to deſcribe the nature of ſin.</p>
            <p>Sin is the tranſgreſſion of the law:—This is the ſcripture definition of ſin. Now the law of God being holy, juſt and good; ſin muſt be altogether unholy, unjuſt and evil. If I was define ſin, I ſhould call it a contrariety to GOD; and as ſuch muſt be the vileſt thing in the world; it is full of all evil; it is
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:012494_0005_0F8A901E53C11930"/>
the evil of evils; the only evil, in which dwells no good thing; and is moſt deſtructive to God's creation, where ever it takes effect. It was ſin that transformed the very angels in heaven, into devils; and it was ſin that cauſed hell to be made. If it had not been for ſin, there never would have been ſuch a thing as hell or devil, death or miſery.</p>
            <p>And if ſin is ſuch a thing as we have juſt deſcribed; it muſt be worſe than the devils and hell itſelf.—Sin is full of deadly poiſon; it is full of malignity and hatred againſt God, againſt all his divine perfections and atributes, againſt his wiſdom, againſt his power, againſt his holineſs and goodneſs againſt his mercy and juſtice, againſt his written law and goſpel; yea, againſt his very being and exiſtence. Were it in the power of ſin, it would even dethrone God, and ſet it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on the throne.</p>
            <p>When Chriſt the Son of the Moſt High, came down from the glorious world above, into this wretched world of ſin and ſorrow, to ſeek and to ſave that which was loſt, ſin, or ſinners roſe up againſt him, as ſoon as he entered our world, and purſued him with helliſh malice, night and day, for above thirty years together, till they kill'd him.</p>
            <p>Further, ſin is againſt the Holy Ghoſt; it oppoſes all his good and holy operations upon the children of me. When, and wherever there is the out-pouring of the Spin of God, upon the children of men, in a way of conviction and converſion; ſin will immediately prompt the devil and his children to riſe up againſt it, and they will oppoſe <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> work with all their power, and in every ſhape. And if open oppoſition will not do, the devil will mimick the work, and thus prevent the good effect.</p>
            <p>Thus we find by the ſcripture accounts, that whenever God raiſes up men, and uſes them as inſtruments of convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and converſion, the devil and his inſtruments will rise up to deſtroy both the reformers and the reformed. That it has been from the early days of Chriſtianity, to this day
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:012494_0005_0F8A901E53C11930"/>
We have found it ſo in our day. In the time of the out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pouring of the Spirit of God in theſe colonies, to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction and reformation of many; immediately ſin and the devil influenced numbers to riſe up againſt the good work of God, calling it deluſion, and work of the devil. And thus ſin alſo oppoſes every motion of the Spirit of God, in the heart of every Chriſtian; this makes a warfare in the ſoul.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I ſhall endeavour to ſhew the ſad conſequences or ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects of ſin upon the children of men.</p>
            <p>Sin has poiſon'd them, &amp; made them diſtracted or fools. The Pſalmiſt ſays, The fool hath ſaid in his heart, there is no God. And Solomon, thro' his Proverbs, calls ungodly ſinners fools; and their ſin he calls their folly, and fooliſhneſs. The Apoſtle James ſays, But the tongue can no man tame, it is an unruly evil, full of deadly poiſon. It is the heart that is in the firſt place full of deadly poiſon. The tongue is only an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpreter of the heart. Sin has viriated the whole man, both ſoul and body; all the powers are corrupted; it has turned the minds of men againſt all good, towards all evil. So poiſoned are they, according to the prophet Iſaiah v. ch. 20 ver. "Wo unto them that call evil good, and good evil<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that put darkneſs for light, and light for darkneſs; that put bitter for ſweet, and ſweet for bitter." And Chriſt Jeſus ſaith in John iii. 19, 20. "And this is the condemnation, that light is come into the world, and men loved darkneſs rather than light, becauſe their deeds were evil. For every one that doth evil hateth the light, neither cometh to the light, leſt his deeds ſhould be reproved." Sin has ſtupified mankind, they are now ignorant of God their maker; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther do they enquire after him. And they are ignorant of themſelves, they know not what is good for them, neither do they underſtand their danger; and they have no fear of God before their eyes.</p>
            <p>Further, ſin has blinded their eyes, ſo that they can't diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:012494_0006_0F8A901F1B8DA660"/>
ſpiritual things; neither do they ſee the way that they ſhould go, and they are deaf as adders, ſo that they cannot hear the joyful ſound of the goſpel that brings glad tidings of peace and pardon to ſinners of mankind. Neither do they regard the Charmer charming never ſo wiſely.—Not only ſo, but ſin has made man proud, tho' he has nothing to be proud of; for he has loſt all his excellency, his beauty and happineſs; he is a bankrupt, and is excommunicated from God; he was turned out of paradiſe by God himſelf, and become a vagabond in God's world, and as ſuch he has no right nor title to the leaſt crumb of mercy in the world: yet he is proud, he is haughty, and exalts himſelf above God, tho' he is wretched and miſerable, and poor, and blind and naked. He glories in his ſhame. Sin has made him beaſtly and deviliſh; yea he is ſunk beneath the beaſts, and is worſe than the ravenous beaſts, of the wilderneſs. He is become ill-natur'd, cruel and murderous; he is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentious and quarrelſome. I ſaid he is worſe than the ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venous beaſts, for wolves and bears don't devour their own kind, but man does; yea we have numberleſs inſtances of women killing their own children; ſuch women I think are worſe than ſhe tygers.</p>
            <p>Sin has made men diſhoneſt and deceitful, ſo that he goes about cheating and defrauding and deceiving his fellow men in the world: yea, he is become a cheat himſelf, he goes about in a vain ſhew; we don't know where to find man. Some times we find as an angel of God; and at other times we find as a devil, even one and the ſame man. Sin has made man a liar even from the womb; ſo that there is no believing nor truſting him. The royal pſalmiſt ſays, "The wicked are eſtranged from the womb, they go aſtray as ſoon as they are born, ſpeaking lies."—His language is alſo <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> he had a pure and holy language, in his innocency, to adore and praiſe God his maker, he now cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſwears, and profanes the holy name of God, and curſes
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:012494_0006_0F8A901F1B8DA660"/>
and damns his fellow-creatutes. In a word, man is a moſt unruly and ungovernable creature, and is become as the wild aſs's colt, and is harder to tame than any of God's creatures in this world. In ſhort, man is worſe than all creatures in this lower world, his propenſity is to evil and that continually; he is more like the devil than any crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we can think of: and I think it is not going beyond the word of God, to ſay, man is the moſt deviliſh creature in the world. Chriſt ſaid to his diſciples, One of you is a devil; to the Jews he ſaid, Ye are of your father the devil, and the luſts of your father ye will do. Thus every un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted ſoul is a child of the devil, ſin has made them ſo.</p>
            <p>We have given ſome few hints of the nature of ſin, and the effects of ſin on mankind.</p>
            <p>We ſhall in the next place conſider the wages or the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of ſin, which is death.</p>
            <p>Sin is the cauſe of all the miſeries that attend poor ſinful man, which will finally bring him to death, death tempo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral and eternal. I ſhall firſt conſider his temporal death.</p>
            <p>His temporal death then begins as ſoon as he is born. Tho' it ſeems to us that he is juſt beginning to live, yet in fact he is juſt entered into a ſtate of death: as St. Paul ſays, "Wherefore, as by one man ſin entered into the world, and death by ſin; and ſo death paſſed upon all men, for that all have ſinned. Man is ſurrounded with ten thouſand inſtruments of death, and is liable to death every moment of his life; a thouſand diſeaſes await him on every ſide continually; the ſentence of death is paſt upon them as ſoon as they are born: yea they are ſtruck with death as ſoon as they breathe. And it ſeems all the enjoyments of men in this world are alſo poiſoned with ſin: for GOD ſaid to Adam after he had ſinned, "Curſed is the ground for thy ſake, in ſorrow ſhalt thou eat of it all the days of thy life." By this we plainly ſee that every thing that grows out of the ground is curſed, and all creatures that God hath made for man
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:012494_0007_0F8A901FCF953648"/>
are curſed alſo; and whatever God curſes is a curſed thing indeed. Thus death and deſtruction is in all the enjoyments of men in this life, every enjoyment in this world is liable to misfortune in a thouſand ways, both by ſea and land.</p>
            <p>How many ſhips, that have been loaded with the choiceſt treaſures of the earth, have been ſwallowed up in the ocean, many times juſt before they enter their deſired haven. And vaſt treaſures have been conſumed by fire on the land, &amp;c. And the fruits of the earth are liable to many judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. And the deareſt and neareſt enjoyments of men are generally balanced with equal ſorrow and grief. A man and his wife who have liv'd together in happineſs for many years; that have comforted each other in various changes of life, muſt at laſt be ſeperated; one or the other muſt be taken away firſt by death, and then the poor ſurvivor is drowned in tears, in ſorrow, mourning and grief. And when a dear child or children are taken away by death the bereaved parents are bowed down with ſorrow and deep mourning. When Joſeph was ſold by his brethren unto the Iſhmaelites, they took his coat and rolled it in blood, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it to their father, and the good patriarch knew it to be Joſeph's coat, and he concluded that his dear Joſeph was devoured by evil beaſts, and he was plunged all over in ſorrow and bitter mourning, and he refuſed to be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forted. And ſo when tender parents are taken away by death, the children are left comfortleſs.—All this is the ſad effect of ſin.—Theſe are the wages of ſin.</p>
            <p>And ſecondly, we are to conſider man's ſpiritual death, while he is here in this world. We find it thus written in the word of God. 'And the Lord God commanded the man, ſaying, of every tree of the garden thou mayeſt freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge, of good and evil, thou ſhalt not eat of it, for in the day that thou eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely die.' And yet he did eat of it, and ſo he and all his poſterity, are but dead men. And St. Paul to
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:012494_0007_0F8A901FCF953648"/>
the Epheſians ſaith, 'You hath he quickened, who were dead in treſpaſſes and ſins.—The great Mr. Henry ſays in this place, that unregenerate ſouls are dead in treſpaſſes and ſins. All thoſe who are in their ſins, are dead in ſins; yea, in treſpaſſes and ſins; which may ſignify all ſorts of ſins, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitual and actual; ſins of heart and life. Sin is the death of the ſoul. Wherever that prevails, there is a privation of all ſpiritual life. Sinners are dead in ſtate, being deſtitute of the principles and powers of ſpirtual life; and cut off from God, the fountain of life: and they are dead in law, as a condemned malefactor is ſaid to be a dead man. Now a dead man, in a natural ſenſe, is unactive, and is of no ſervice to the living; there is no correſpondence between the dead and the living: there is no agreement or union between them, no fellowſhip at all between the dead and the living. A dead man is altogether ignorant of the intercourſes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongſt the living:—juſt ſo it is with men that are ſpiritual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly dead; they have no agreeable activity. Their activity in ſin, is their deadneſs, and inactivity towards God. They are of no ſervice to God; and they have no correſpondence with heaven; and there is no agreement or fellowſhip be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them and the living God; and they are totally igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of the agreable and ſweet intercourſe there is between God and his children here below: and they are ignorant, and know nothing of that bleſſed fellowſhip and union there is among the ſaints here below. They are ready to ſay in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, behold how they love one another! But they know nothing of that love, that the children of God enjoy. As ſin is in oppoſition to God; ſo ſinners are at enmity againſt God; there is no manner of agreement between them.</p>
            <p>Let us conſider further. God is a living God, he is all life, the fountain of life; and a ſinner is a dead ſoul; there is nothing but death in him. And now judge ye, what a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement can there be between them? God is a holy and pure God, and a ſinner is an unholy and filthy creature;—
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:012494_0008_0F8A9020A40E3980"/>
God is a righteous Being, and a ſinner is an unrighteous crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; God is light, and a ſinner is darkneſs itſelf, &amp;c. Fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, what agreement can there be between God and a lyar, a thief, a drunkard, a ſwearer, a profane creature, a whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monger, an adulterer, and idolater, &amp;c. No one that has any ſenſe, dare ſay, that there is any agreement. Further, as ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners are dead to God, as ſuch, they have no delight in God, and godlineſs; they have no taſte for the religion of Jeſus Chriſt; they have no pleaſure in the holy exerciſes of religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Prayer is no pleaſant work with them; or if they have any pleaſure in it, it is not out of love to God, but out of ſelf-love, like the Phariſees of old; they loved to pray in open view of men, that they might have praiſe from them. And perhaps, they were not careful to pray in ſecret. Theſe were dead ſouls, they were unholy, rotten hypocrites, and ſo all their prayers and religious exerciſes were cold, dead, and abominable ſervices to God. Indeed they are dead to all the duties that God requires of them; they are dead to the holy bible; to all the laws, commands, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepts thereof; and to the ordinances of the goſpel of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. When they read the book of God, it is like an old almanack to them, a dead book. But it is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe they are dead, and as ſuch, all their ſervices are againſt God, even their beſt ſervices are an abomination unto God; yea, a ſinner is ſo dead in ſin, that the threatnings of God don't move them. All the thunderings and lightnings of Mount-Sinai don't ſtir them. And all the curſes of the law are out againſt them; yea, every time they read theſe curſes in the bible, they are curſing them to their faces, and to their very eyes; yet they are unconcern'd, and go on in ſin without fear. And laſtly here, ſin has ſo ſtupify'd the ſinner, that he will not believe his own ſenſes; he wont believe his own eyes, nor his own ears; he reads the book of God, but he does not believe what he reads. And he hears of God, and heaven, and eternal happineſs, and of hell and eternal
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:012494_0008_0F8A9020A40E3980"/>
miſery; but he believes none of theſe things; he goes on, as if there were no God, nor heaven and happineſs; neither has he any fear of hell and eternal torments;—and he ſees his fellow men dropping away daily on every ſide, yet he goes on careleſsly in ſin, as if he never was to die. And if he at any time thinks of dying, he hardly believes his own tho'ts. Death is at great diſtance, ſo far off, that he don't concern himſelf about it, ſo as to prepare for it. God mournfully complains of his people, that they don't conſider; O that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their latter end.</p>
            <p>The next thing I ſhall conſider, is the actual death of the body, or ſeperation between ſoul and body. At the ceſſation of natural life, there is an end of all the enjoyments of this life; there is no more joy nor ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; no more hope nor fear, as to the body; no more contrivance and carrying on any buſineſs; no more mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandizing and trading; no more farming; no more buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and ſelling; no more building of any kind, no more contrivance at all to live in the world; no more flatteries nor frowns from the world; no more honor nor re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach; no more praiſe; no more good report, nor evil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port; no more learning of any trades, arts or ſciences in the world; no more ſinful pleaſures, they are all at an end; re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creations, viſiting, tavern haunting, muſic and dancing, chambering and carouſing, playing at dice and cards, or any game whatſoever; curſing and ſwearing, and profaning the holy name of God, drunkenneſs, fighting, debauchery, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and cheating, in this world, muſt ceaſe forever. Not only ſo, but they muſt bid an eternal farewel to all the world; bid farewel to all their beloved ſins and pleaſures; and the places and poſſeſſions, that knew them once, ſhall know them no more forever. And further, they muſt bid adieu to all ſacred and divine things. They are obliged to leave the bible, and all the ordinances thereof; and to bid farewel to
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:012494_0009_0F8A902155906E78"/>
preachers, and all ſermons and all chriſtian people, and chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian converſation; they muſt bid a long farewel to ſabbaths and ſeaſons, and opportunities of worſhip; yea, an eternal farewel to all mercy, and all hope; an eternal farewel to God the Father, Son and Holy Ghoſt, and adieu to hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and all happineſs, to ſaints and all the inhabitants of the upper world. At your leiſure pleaſe to read the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruction of Babylon; you will find it written in the 18th of the Revelation.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, the poor departed ſoul muſt take up its lodging in ſorrow, wo and miſery, in the lake that burns with fire and brimſtone, where the worm dieth not, and the fire is not quenched; where a multitude of frightful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed devils dwell, and the damned ghoſts of Adam's race; where darkneſs, horror and deſpair reigns, where hope never comes, and where poor guilty naked ſouls will be tormented with exquiſite torments, even the wrath of the Almighty poured out-upon their damned ſouls; the ſmoke of their torments aſcending up forever and ever; their mouths and noſtrils ſtreaming forth with living fire; and helliſh groans, howlings, cries and ſhrieks all round them, and mercileſs devils upbraiding them for their folly and madneſs, and tormenting them inceſſantly.—And there they muſt endure the moſt unſatiable, fruitleſs deſire, and the moſt overwhelming ſhame and confuſion, and the moſt horrible fear, and the moſt doleful ſorrow, and the moſt racking deſpair. When they caſt their flaming eyes to heaven, with Dives in torments, they behold an angry and frowning GOD, whoſe eyes are as a flaming fire, and they are ſtruck with ten thouſand darts of pain; and the ſight of the happineſs of the ſaints above, adds to their pains and aggravates their miſery. And when they reflect upon their paſt folly and madneſs in neglecting the great ſalvation in their day, it will pierce them with ten thouſand inconceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able torments; it will as it were enkindle their hell afreſh;
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:012494_0009_0F8A902155906E78"/>
and it will cauſe them to curſe themſelves bitterly, and curſe the day in which they were born, and curſe their parents that were the inſtruments of their being in the world; yea they will curſe, bitterly curſe and wiſh that very GOD that gave them their being, to be in the ſame condition with them in hell torments. This is what is called the ſecond death, and it is the laſt death, and an eternal death to a guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty ſoul.</p>
            <p>And O eternity, eternity, eternity! Who can meaſure it? Who can count the years thereof? Arithmetic muſt fail, the thoughts of men and angels are drowned in it; how ſhall we deſcribe eternity? To what ſhall we compare it? Were it poſſible to employ a fly to carry off this globe by the ſmall particles thereof, and to carry them to ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that it ſhould return once in ten thouſand years for another particle, and ſo continue till it has carried off all this globe, and framed them together in ſome unknown ſpace, till it has made juſt ſuch a world as this is: after all eternity would remain the ſame unexhauſted duration. This muſt be the unavoidable portion of all impenitent ſinners, let them be who they will, great or ſmall, honorable or ignoble, rich or poor, bond or free. Negroes, Indians, Engliſh, or of what nations ſoever, all that die in their ſins, muſt go to hell together, for the wages of ſin is death.</p>
            <p>The next thing that I was to conſider is this:</p>
            <p>That eternal life and happineſs is the free gift of God, thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
            <p>Under this propoſition I ſhall endeavour to ſhew what this life and happineſs is.</p>
            <p>The life that is mentioned in our text is, a ſpiritual life: it is the life of the ſoul, a reſtoration of ſoul from ſin, to ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, from darkneſs to light, a tranſlation from the king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and dominion of ſatan, to the kingdom of God's grace. In other words, it is being reſtored to the image of God, and delivered from the image of ſatan. And this life con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:012494_0010_0F8A90221D2D15F0"/>
in union of the ſoul to God, and communion with God; a real participation of the divine nature, or in the a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtle's words, it is Chriſt formed within us; I live, ſays he, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me. And the apoſtle John ſaith, God is love, and he that dwelleth in love, dwelleth in God, and God in him. This is the life of the ſoul. It is called emphatically life, becauſe it is a life that ſhall never have a period, a ſtable, permanent, and unchangeable life, called in the ſcriptures, everlaſting life, or life eternal. And the happineſs of this life conſiſts in communion with God, or in the ſpiritual enjoyment of God. As much as a ſoul enjoys of God in this life, juſt ſo much of life and happineſs he enjoys or poſſeſſes; yea, juſt ſo much of heaven he en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys. A true chriſtian, deſires no other heaven, but the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of God, a full and perfect enjoyment of God, is a full and perfect heaven and happineſs to a gracious ſoul.—Further, this life is called eternal life, becauſe God has plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a living principle in the ſoul; and whereas he was dead before, now he is made alive unto God; there is an active principle within him towards God, he now moves towards God in his religious devotions and exerciſes; is daily comfortably and ſweetly walking with God, in all his ordinances and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; his delight is in the ways of God; he breathes towards God, a living breath, in praiſes, prayers, adorations and thankſgivings; his prayers are now heard in the heavens, and his praiſes delight the ears of the Almighty, and his thankſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>givings are accepted. So alive is he now to God, that it is his meat and drink, yea more than his meat and drink, to do the will of his heavenly Father. It is his delight, his happineſs and pleaſure to ſerve God. He does not drag himſelf to his duties now, but he does them out of choice, and with alacrity of ſoul. Yea, ſo alive is he to God, that he gives up himſelf and all that he has entirely to God, to be for him and none other; his whole aim is to glorify God in all things, whether by life or death, all the ſame to him.</p>
            <p>We have a bright example of this in St. Paul. After he
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:012494_0010_0F8A90221D2D15F0"/>
was converted, he was all alive to God; he regarded not his life, but was willing to ſpend, and be ſpent in the ſervice of his God; he was hated, revil'd, deſpiſed, laughed at, and called by all manner of evil names; was ſcourged, ſtoned and impriſoned;—and all cou'd not ſtop his activity towards God. He would boldly and couragiouſly go on in preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the goſpel of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, to poor, loſt, and undone ſinners; he would do the work God ſet him about, in ſpite of all oppoſition he met with, either from men or devils, earth or hell; come death, or come life, none of theſe things moved him, becauſe he was alive unto God. Tho' he ſuffered hunger and thirſt, cold and heat, poverty &amp; naked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by day &amp; by night, by ſea and land, &amp; was in danger all ways; yet he would ſerve God amidſt all theſe dangers. Read his amazing account in 2 Cor. 11. 23 and on.</p>
            <p>Another inſtance of marvellous love towards God, we have in Daniel. When there was a proclamation of prohibition, ſent by the king, to all his ſubjects, forbidding them to call upon their gods, for thirty days; which was done by envious men, that they might find occaſion againſt Daniel the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of the Moſt High God; yet he having the life of God in his ſoul, regarded not the king's decree, but made his pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titions to his God, as often as he uſed to do, tho' death was threatned to the diſobedient. But he feared not the hell they had prepared; for it ſeems, the den reſembled hell, and the lions repreſented the devils. And when he was actually caſt into the lion's den, the ravenous beaſts become meek and innocent as lambs, before the prophet, becauſe he was alive unto God; the ſpirit of the Moſt High was in him, and the lions were afraid before him. Thus it was with Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niel and Paul; they went thro' fire and water, as the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſaying is, becauſe they had eternal life in their ſouls in eminent manner; and they regarded not this life, for the cauſe and glory of God. And thus it has been in all ages with true Chriſtians. Many of the fore-fathers of the Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lish,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:012494_0011_0F8A9022DADF8440"/>
in this country, had this life, and are gone the ſame way, that the holy prophets and apoſtles went. Many of them went thro' all manner of ſufferings for God; and a great number of them are gone home to heaven, in chariots of fire. I have ſeen the place in London, called Smithfield, where numbers were burnt to death for the religion of Jeſus Chriſt. And there is the ſame life in true chriſtians now in theſe days; and if there ſhould perſecutions ariſe in our day, I verily believe, true chriſtians would ſuffer with the ſame ſpirit and temper of mind, as thoſe did, who ſuffered in days paſt.—This is the life which our text ſpeaks of.</p>
            <p>We proceed in the next place to ſhew, that this life, which we have deſcrib'd, is the free gift of God, thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord.</p>
            <p>Sinners have forfeited all mercy into the hand of divine juſtice, and have merited hell and damnation to themſelves; for the wages of ſin is everlaſting death, but heaven and happineſs is a free gift; it comes by favour; and all me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit is excluded: and eſpecially if we conſider that we are fallen ſinful creatures, and there is nothing in us that can recommend us to the favour of God; and we can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is agreeable and acceptable to God; and the mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies we enjoy in this life are altogether from the pure mercy of God; we are unequal to them. Good old Jacob cried out, under a ſenſe of his unworthineſs, "I am leſs than the leaſt of all thy mercies," and we have nothing to give unto God, if we eſſay to give all the ſervice that we are capable of, we ſhould give him nothing but what was his own, and when we give up ourſelves unto God, both ſoul and body, we give him nothing; for we were his before; he had right to do with us as he pleaſed, either to throw us into hell, or ſave us.—There is nothing that we can call our own, but our ſins; and who is he that dares to ſay, I expect to have hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven for my ſins? for our text ſays, that the wages of ſin is death. If we are thus unequal and unworthy of the leaſt
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:012494_0011_0F8A9022DADF8440"/>
mercy in this life, how much more are we unworthy of eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal life? yet God can find it in his heart to give it. And it is altogether unmerited; it is a free gift to undeſerving and hell deſerving ſinners of mankind: it is altogether of God's ſovereign good pleaſure to give it. It is of free grace &amp; ſovereign mercy, and from the unbounded goodneſs of God; he was ſelf-moved to it. And it is ſaid that this life is giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en in and through the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. It could not be given in any other way, but in and through the death and ſufferings of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt; Chriſt himſelf is the gift, and he is the chriſtian's life. "For God ſo loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have everlaſting life." The word ſays further, "For by grace ye are ſaved, thro' faith, and that not of yourſelves, it is the gift of God." This is given thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord; it is Chriſt that purchaſed it with his own blood; he prepared it with his divine and almighty power; and by the ſame power, and by the influence of his ſpirit, he prepares us for it; and by his divine grace preſerves us to it. In a word, he is all in all in our eternal ſalvation; all this is the free gift of God.</p>

You are an Indian, a deſpiſed creature; but you have deſpiſed yourſelf; yea you have deſpiſed God more; you have trodden under foot his authority; you have deſpiſed his commands and precepts: and now, as God ſays, be ſure your ſins will find you out. And now, poor Moſes, your ſins have found you out, and they have overtaken you this day; the day
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:012494_0012_0F8A90239343F220"/>
of your death is now come; the king of terrors is at hand; you have but a very few moments to breathe in this world.—The juſt laws of man, and the holy law of Jehovah, call aloud for the deſtruction of your mortal life; God ſays, "Whoſo ſheddeth mans blood, by man ſhall his blood be ſhed." This is the antient decree of heaven, and it is to be executed by man; nor have you the leaſt gleam of hope of eſcape, for the unalterable ſentence is paſt; the terrible day of execution is come; the unwelcome guard is about you; and the fatal inſtruments of death are now made rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy; your coffin and your grave, your laſt lodging, are open ready to receive you.</p>
                        <p>Alas! poor Moſes, now you know, by ſad, by woful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience, the living truth of our text, that the wages of ſin is death. You have been already dead; yea twice dead: by nature ſpiritually dead. And ſince the awful ſentence of death has been paſt upon you, you have been dead to all the pleaſures of this life; or all the pleaſures, lawful or unlawful, have been dead to you: And death, which is the wages of ſin, is ſtanding even on this ſide of your grave ready to put a final period to your mortal life; and juſt beyond the grave, eternal death awaits your poor ſoul, and the devils are ready to drag your miſerable ſoul down to their bottom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs den, where everlaſting wo and horror reigns; the place is filled with doleful ſhrieks, howls and groans of the dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned.

And O! what manner of repentance ought you to manifeſt! How ought your heart to bleed for what you have done! How ought you to proſtrate your ſoul before a bleeding God! And under ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condemnation, cry out, Ah Lord, ah Lord, what have I done!—Whatever partiality, injuſtice and error there may be among the judges of the earth, remember that you have deſerved a thouſand deaths, and a thouſand hells, by reaſon

of your ſins, at the hands of a holy God. Should God come out againſt you in ſtrict juſtice, alas! what could you ſay for yourſelf? for you have been brought up under the bright ſun-ſhine, and plain, and loud ſound of the goſpel; and you have had a good education; you can read and write well; and God has given you a good natural underſtanding: and therefore your ſins are ſo much more aggravated. You have not ſinned in ſuch an ignorant manner as others have done; but you have ſinned with both your eyes open as it were, under the light, even the glorious light of the goſpel of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt.—You have ſinned againſt the light of your own conſcience, againſt your knowledge and underſtanding; you have ſinned againſt the pure and holy laws of God, and the juſt laws of men; you have ſinned againſt heaven and earth; you have ſinned againſt all the mercies and goodneſs of God; you have ſinned againſt the whole bible, againſt the old and new-teſtament; you have ſinned againſt the blood of Chriſt, which is the blood of the everlaſting covenant. O poor Moſes, ſee what you have done! and now repent, repent, I ſay again repent; ſee how the blood you ſhed cries againſt you, and the Avenger of Blood is at your heels. O fly, fly to the Blood of the Lamb of God for the pardon of all your aggravated ſins.</p>
                        <p>But let us now turn to a more pleaſant theme.—Tho' you have been a great ſinner, a heaven daring ſinner; yet hark and hear the joyful ſound from heaven, even from the King of kings, and Lord of lords; that the gift of God is eternal life, thro' Jeſus Chriſt our Lord. It is a free gift, and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to the greateſt ſinners, and upon their true repentance towards God and faith in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, they ſhall be welcome to the life, which we have ſpoken of; it is offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon free terms. He that hath no money may come; he that hath no righteouſneſs, no goodneſs, may come; the call is to poor undone ſinners; the call is not to the righteous, but ſinners, calling them to repentance. Hear the voice of
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:012494_0013_0F8A90244F110E40"/>
the Son of the moſt high God, Come unto me, all yea that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you reſt. This is a call, a gracious call to you, poor Moſes, under your preſent burdens and diſtreſſes. And Chriſt alone has a right to call ſinners to himſelf. It would be preſumption for a mighty angel to call a poor ſinner in this manner; and were it poſſible for you to apply to all God's creatures, they would with one voice tell you, that it was not in them to help you. Go to all the means of grace, they would prove miſerable helps, without Chriſt himſelf. Yea, apply to all the mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters of the goſpel in the world, they would all ſay, that it was not in them, but would only prove as indexes, to point out to you, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the only ſaviour of ſinners of mankind. Yea, go to all the angels in heaven, they would do the ſame. Yea, go to God the Father himſelf, without Chriſt, he cou'd not help you, to ſpeak after the manner of men, he would alſo point to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, &amp; ſay this is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleaſed, hear ye him. Thus you ſee, poor Moſes, that there is none in heaven, or on the earth, that can help you, but Chriſt; he alone has power to ſave, and to give life.—God the eternal hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed him, choſe him, authorized, and fully commiſſioned him to ſave ſinners. He came down from heaven, into this lower world, and became as one of us, and ſtood in our room. He was the ſecond Adam. And as God demanded perfect obedience of the firſt Adam; the ſecond fulfil'd it; and as the firſt ſinned, and incurred the wrath and anger of God, the ſecond endur'd it; he ſuffered in our room. As he became ſin for us, he was a man of ſorrows, and acquainted with grief; all our ſtripes were laid upon him; yea, he was final<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly condemned, becauſe we were under condemnation; and at laſt was executed and put to death, for our ſins; was lift<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up between the heaven and the earth, and was crucified on the accurſed tree; his bleſſed hands and feet were faſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed there;—there he died a ſhameful and ignominious death<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

there he finiſhed the great work of our redemption: there his hearts blood was ſhed for our cleanſing: there he fully ſatisfied the divine juſtice of God, for penitent, believing ſinners, tho' they have been the chief of ſinners.—O Moſes! this is good news to you, in this laſt day of your life; here is a crucified Saviour at hand for your ſins; his bleſſed hands are out-ſtretched, all in a gore of blood for you. This is the only Saviour, an almighty Saviour, juſt ſuch as you ſtand in infinite and periſhing need of. O, poor Moſes! hear the dying prayer of a gracious Saviour on the accurſed tree,—Father forgive them, for they know not what they do. This was a prayer for his enemies and murderers; and it is for you, if you would only repent and believe in him. O why will you die eternally, poor Moſes, ſince Chriſt has died for ſinners?

And it was the ſin of drunkenneſs that has brought this deſtruction and untimely death upon him. There is a dreadful wo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced from the Almighty againſt drunkards, and it
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:012494_0015_0F8A9026E4EB9190"/>
this ſin, this abominable, this beaſtly and accurſed ſin of drunkenneſs, that has ſtript us of every deſirable comfort in this life; by this we are poor, miſerable and wretched; by this ſin we have no name nor credit in the world among po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lite nations; for this ſin we are deſpiſed in the world, and it is all right and juſt, for we deſpiſe ourſelves more; and if we don't regard ourſelves, who will regard us? And it is for our ſins, and eſpecially for that accurſed, that moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veliſh ſin of drunkenneſs that we ſuffer every day. For the love of ſtrong drink we ſpend all that we have, and every thing we can get. By this ſin we can't have comfortable houſes, nor any thing comfortable in our houſes; neither food nor raiment, nor decent utenſils. We are obliged to put up any ſort of ſhelter juſt to ſcreeh us from the ſeverity of the weather; and we go about with very mean, ragged and dirty cloathes, almoſt naked. And we are half ſtarved, for moſt of the time obliged to pick up any thing to eat.—And our poor children are ſuffering every day for want of the neceſſaries of life; they are very often crying for want of food, and we have nothing to give them; and in the cold weather they are ſhivering and crying, being pinched with cold.—All this is for the love of ſtrong drink. And this is not all the miſery and evil we bring on ourſelves in this world; but when we are intoxicated with ſtrong drink, we drown our rational powers, by which we are diſtinguiſhed from the brutal creation; we unman ourſelves, and bring ourſelves not only level with the beaſts of the field, but ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven degrees beneath them; yea we bring ourſelves level with the devils; I don't know but we make ourſelves worſe than the devils, for I never heard of drunken devils.</p>
                        <p>My poor kindred, do conſider what a dreadful abomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſin drunkenneſs is. God made us men, and we chuſe to be beaſts and devils; God made us rational creatures, and we chuſe to be fools. Do conſider further, and behold a drunkard, and ſee how he looks, when he has drowned

as reaſon; how deformed and ſhameful does he appear? He diſ-figures every part of him, both ſoul and body, which was made after the image of God. He appears with awful deformity, and his whole viſage is diſ-figured; if he attempts to ſpeak he cannot bring out his words diſtinct, ſo as to be underſtood; if he walks he reals and ſtaggers to and fro, and tumbles down. And ſee how he behaves, he is now laughing, and then he is crying; he is ſinging and the next minute he is mourning; and is all love to every one, and anon he is raging, &amp; for fighting, &amp; killing all before him, even the neareſt and the deareſt relations and friends: Yea nothing is too bad for a drunken man to do. He will do that, which he would not do for the world, in his right mind; he may lie with his own ſiſter or daughter as Lot did.</p>
                        <p>Further, when a perſon is drunk, he is juſt good for no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in the world; he is of no ſervice to himſelf, to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, to his neighbours, or his country; and how much more unfit is he in ſerve God: yet he is juſt fit for the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice of the devil.</p>
                        <p>Again, a man in drunkenneſs is in all manner of danger he may be kill'd by his fellow-men, by wild beaſts, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

O fools when will ye be wiſe?—We all know the truth of what I have been ſaying, by what we have ſeen and heard of drunken deaths. How many have been

drowned in our rivers, and how many frozen to death in the winter ſeaſons! yet drunkards go on without fear and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration: alas, alas! What will become of all ſuch drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ards? Without doubt they muſt all go to hell, except they truly repent and turn to God. Drunkenneſs is ſo common amongſt us, that even our young men and young women are not aſhamed to get drunk. Our young men will get drunk as ſoon as they will eat when they are hungry.—It is generally eſteemed amongſt men, more abominable for a woman to be drunk, than a man; and yet there is nothing more common amongſt us that female drunkards. Women ought to be more modeſt than men; the holy ſcriptures re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend modeſty to women in particular:—but drunken women have no modeſty at all.

                        <p>And to conclude, conſider my poor kindred, you that are drunkards, into what a miſerable condition you have brought yourſelves. There is a dreadful wo thunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt you every day, and the Lord ſays, That drunk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
