            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>CHARACTER OF THIS WORK, FROM THE <hi>BRITISH CRITIC.</hi>
                  </head>
                  <p>Though we are not accuſtomed to recommend, with much warmth, the reading of Novels, yet our caution ariſes chiefly from the fear of their being too much, or too indiſcriminately peruſed. A few ſelect books of this kind may be read with advantage, provided that ſuch reading be not made a daily or ſerious occupation. With this reſtriction we recommend very cordially <hi>ſuch volumes as theſe we are conſidering. A STORY more intereſting and affecting, or better told than this, has ſeldom come under our examination.</hi> Auſtere as critics are imagined to be, they are not inſenſible to the charms of ſuch a heroine as Ellen Mordaunt. Perhaps the principal incident in her ſtory, upon which all the reſt turns, is not managed as we could wiſh; what is commonly called firſt love, that is the fancy of a boy and girl for each other, founded upon ſeeing, rather than knowing one another, is not indeed what we inſiſt upon being adhered to. But a firſt attachment like Ellen's, ſounded upon ſolid merit, and long acquaintance, and ſanctioned by parents on both ſides, ſhould not have been renounced ſo ſpeedily. At leaſt, if duty and honour forbade her union with Henry, there was no ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity—But <hi>we will not diminiſh the painfully pleaſing ſuſpence in which this Novel muſt hold its readers;</hi> we ſhall only remark, that the title of it appears to us not happily choſen. <hi>The cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Ellen is actually diſtinguiſhed not ſo much by</hi> Plain Senſe, <hi>as by highly cultivated judgment, exquiſite feeling, and invincible inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity. Parents may not only with ſafety put theſe volumes into the hands of their children, but may even peruſe them with advantage themſelves.</hi>

                     <p>MARIA VILLARS was born a beauty. Her firſt ſmile was enchantment, her firſt movement grace: nor had fortune been leſs favourable to her than nature—ſhe and one ſon were the only offspring born to lord Villars by his firſt wife: On his marriage, 20,000l. the fortune that his wife brought him, had been by marriage ſettle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments allotted to younger children, and there having been no limitation, as to number, the whole ſum became the property of Maria. Lady Villars died in a few months after the birth of her daughter; and many more had not elapſed before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d Villars exchanged the ſober garb of affliction, for the gay trappings of a bridegroom.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="6" facs="unknown:036127_0004_10084F0AC4C6A800"/>On this ſecond marriage, Maria was placed under the care of a ſiſter of her father's, a woman, who, to an unbounded love for diſſipation, joined ſo much natural good humour, as made her deſirous that all with whom ſhe had to do, ſhould ſhare in pleaſures, which ſhe thought ſo neceſſary to hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs. Although married, ſhe had no children; ſhe had talked herſelf into the belief, that ſhe was miſerable from the want of them: Maria there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore became her paſſion;—the moſt unlimited in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence ſoon taught her to know no rule for action but her own will. Naturally violent, craving, and vain, ſhe ſoon became tyrannical, ſelfiſh, and overbearing. Nature had beſtowed upon her a quickneſs of apprehenſion, which, had it been properly directed, might have aſſiſted her in procuring ſuch uſeful knowledge as would in time have formed her judgment, and corrected her temper; but this quickneſs being miſtaken by her aunt for wit, it became rather a ſubject of praiſe for itſelf, than cultivated as a means by which to acquire things worthy of praiſe.</p>
                     <p>Of the many accompliſhments, therefore, that Maria made a parade of acquiring, ſhe knew no one tolerably, muſic and dancing excepted. She was born with an accurate ear and a ſweet voice, and ſhe ſo early felt the advantage to be derived from the cultivation of ſuch enchanting talents, that ſhe had acquired a very competent knowledge in the ſcience of muſic, and, in the little leſs dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult one of dancing, ſhe excelled. In her ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt years ſhe had been her aunt's plaything; as time began more to unfold her charms, ſhe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came her boaſt and her exhibition.</p>
                     <p>Where rank, youth, beauty, talents and fortune, were united, it is not wonderful that the uſeful
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036127_0005_10084F0C4E207480"/>
acquirements of the underſtanding were unſought, or that the unobtruſive virtues of the heart were forgotten. In the circle wherein Maria Villars moved, there was but one opinion, "that miſs Villars was perfection." She heard it every hour of the day, ſhe ſaw it in the deference that was paid to her opinions, and in the eagerneſs that was manifeſted even to <hi>prevent</hi> her wiſhes; ſhe repeated it to herſelf continually, and there was certainly no article of her faith to which her mind yielded half ſo perfect an aſſent.</p>
                     <p>Amidſt the general admiration that followed her wherever ſhe appeared, there was not wanting, even from her earlieſt youth, ſeveral individuals, who, allured by her beauty, or induced by her fortune, ſeriouſly ſought her for a wife; but her aunt was in no haſte to induce her to fix her choice; ſhe thought no rank, however high, or fortune however ſplendid, above what might be challenged by the merits of her niece: And Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria (whoſe greateſt delight was in multiplying her conqueſts, and in the infliction of pain) en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged and diſdained all her lovers alike.</p>
                     <p>She was now in her eighteenth year, when one night on her return from a ball, ſhe declared to her aunt in the moſt peremptory terms, that her choice was made, that ſhe was in love with mr. Mordaunt, and that mr. Mordaunt ſhe would marry. The ſhock of an earthquake could not have been more tremendous to the feelings of mrs. Forteſcue, than was this declaration of her niece; She knew mr. Mordaunt for a young man of faſhion and good family, elegant in his perſon and inſinuating in his manners, but he was with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out rank, and almoſt without fortune; as to his underſtanding or his moral character, ſhe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="8" facs="unknown:036127_0006_10084F0F6613E108"/>
never heard either of them mentioned, nor would they have made any part of her inquiries: She attempted to remonſtrate; but ſhe ſoon ſound that ſhe had neither the power that authority beſtows, nor the influence that is derived from affection. Maria had taken her reſolution, and ſhe ſcrupled not to ſay, "that although ſhe ſhould be beſt pleaſed if her marriage were ſanctioned by her aunt's approbation, yet, the want of ſuch ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation ſhould not prevent it."</p>
                     <p>The fact was, that mr. Mordaunt, from the firſt time in which he beheld Maria, had became violently and truly in love with her. There was ſomething in the humility and verity of his paſſion, that had been peculiarly pleaſing to her vanity; his addreſs and his perſon had charmed her; ſhe ſaw his attentions were ſought for by the moſt diſtinguiſhed of her companions; it became, therefore, a point of honour to attach him to herſelf: But, when ſhe learnt that he was the object of the tendereſt love to her moſt intimate friend, ſhe was reſolved to make him her huſband.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Forteſcue, deſpairing of the effect of her own influence with her niece, ſaw no other means to prevent a marriage which ſhe ſo much diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved, except by the force of parental authority; ſhe applied to lord Villars, repreſenting to him the entire deſtruction of thoſe ambitious hopes, the uncommon beauty and attractions of Maria had given birth to, if ſhe were thus permitted to diſpoſe of herſelf: But lord Villars, however he might wiſh that the inclinations of his daughter had taken another bent, was too much engaged in the cares and intereſts that had ariſen from a ſecond marriage, to beſtow much thought <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

him ſince her birth, and whom he conſidered as being totally ſpoiled by the weak indulgence of her aunt; he therefore told his ſiſter, that ſhe muſt abide by the conſequences of her own miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct; that ten thouſand pounds was the whole of what he could ſpare to his daughter on her marriage, but that the reſt of the ſettlement would be her's at his death, and that ſhe muſt endeavour to make the beſt bargain ſhe could.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Forteſcue thus finding that all oppoſition would be vain, no longer troubled herſelf to op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe what ſhe could not prevent. Mr. Mordaunt was made the happieſt of men, by being told Maria Villars was to be his wife; and Maria her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf took the air of ſacrificing ambition and avarice at the ſhrine of love. She became, in truth, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the time of the courtſhip, as much in love with mr. Mordaunt, as ſhe could be with any man. As to mr. Mordaunt, he was not more enchanted with her beauty, nor captivated by the graces of her manner, than he was impreſſed with gratitude, for the preference ſhe gave him; he conſidered ſuch a preference as a proof of the moſt diſintereſted affection, and entertained not a doubt but that in the lovely miſtreſs he was about to poſſeſs, he ſhould find the good humoured com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, the affectionate friend, and the faithful wife; he knew not, nor would it have been in the power of an angel from heaven to have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

influence on the happineſs of that life; but ſhe had not, like him, added, even in imagination, the qualities either of the head or heart; ſhe had not thought about them. The man who was in love with her, was, of courſe, at her diſpoſal; ſhe did not ſo <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ar miſtruſt her charms, as to ſuſpect that this might not always be the caſe, and while ſhe could preſerve an unlimited power over the actions of mr. Mordaunt, ſhe ſought for no other quality on which to ground happineſs; there was no one excellence of the head or heart, nor all the poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble excellencies of both united, that ſhe would not have exchanged for the ſingle virtue of unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited compliance with her wiſhes: But mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt was formed by nature to have beſtowed happineſs of a very different kind from that which Maria required—with perfectly good and clear ſenſe, of a calm and gentle mind, with kind af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and the moſt diſintereſted diſpoſitions, had he met with a heart and temper congenial to his own, there was no degree of domeſtic felicity that he was not capable of giving and receiving.</p>
                     <p>It would have been mr. Mordaunt's wiſh upon his marriage, to have withdrawn from ſcenes of diſſipation and expence, (at once ſo adverſe to his inclination, and ſo inimical to his fortune), to his paternal eſtate in Northumberland. But to this plan mrs. Forteſcue and Maria were equally averſe, and mr. Mordaunt eaſily found in the gaiety of youth, and the inveteracy of habit, a ſufficient excuſe for this oppoſition to his wiſhes; —he hoped time, and the cares of a mother, which he ſaw with pleaſure would ſoon belong to Maria, would produce diſpoſitions more ſuited to his own, and in the mean while he made his happineſs by contributing to her's. He was, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036127_0009_10084F1582247A28"/>
ſomewhat more alarmed when he found, that even after the birth of a daughter, her rage for amuſement ſeemed greater than ever; and long before his tenderneſs thought ſhe ought to have quitted her houſe, he found her eager again to emerge into the world, to form new engage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and to ſeek new pleaſures: She had abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely refuſed to ſuckle her child, and he had been made to believe that her health was too de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licate to admit of her performing ſuch an office; but when he ſaw it ſufficiently robuſt to encoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the vigils of balls and aſſemblies, and the har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſing exertions of morning amuſements, he firſt uttered his ſurpriſe and then ventured to remonſtrate.</p>
                     <p>It was the firſt moment in which he had appeared to have a will diſtinct from that of Maria. The ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence which ſhe betrayed upon this occaſion aſtoniſhed and alarmed him; but the veil was now fallen, and from this hour ſhe appeared in her na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural form. The imperfections of temper in a wife, although ſufficient to deſtroy happineſs, are, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſeldom powerful enough to pluck from the breaſt of a tender hearted man a deep rooted love. Mr. Mordaunt was compelled to be miſerable, but he could not ceaſe to love. It was not ſo with Maria, ſhe had never loved—ſhe never could love any one but herſelf: While mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt contributed to her convenience, or her plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, ſhe ſmiled upon him with a complacency that made him believe himſelf the happieſt of men; when he thwarted her moſt extravagant wiſhes, ſhe armed her brow with defiance, and his hours were paſſed in wrangling and ill humour.</p>
                     <p>For ſome of the firſt years of their marriage, the dread of interrupting thoſe moments of ſun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhine from which he drew his precarious and li<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

enjoyed happineſs, made him give up, undiſputed, almoſt every point to his wife. Her habit of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troul became by this means the more confirmed; and afterwards, when this reaſon ceaſed (for there were no longer moments of ſunſhine), the embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment of his affairs, and the dread that all minds, not ſtrong, feel of probing the bottom of an evil, occaſioned him to go on in the ſame way. Thus at the end of ten years, he found himſelf diſappointed in his hopes of happineſs, involved in debt, the father of three miſerable neglected girls, and the huſband of a decayed beauty, whoſe health had been ruined by diſſipation, and whoſe temper, not naturally good, had been irritated by the diſtreſſes of poverty: Her heart and her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding offered no reſources in the hour of diſappointment, and her continual ſelf reproaches for having ſo fooliſhly thrown herſelf away, awakened mr. Mordaunt to a wandering ſenſe, how the moſt beautiful features, or the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect form, could ever have been a veil ſufficiently thick, to have concealed from his obſervation the deformity of her temper, and the ſelfiſhneſs of her heart.</p>
                     <p>As to what was now to be done, there remained no option: mrs. Forteſcue had ſo often relieved the diſtreſſes of her niece that ſhe had no longer the power of doing ſo—The ten thouſand pounds paid at her marriage, were diſſipated— of the ten that were to be received on the death of lord Villars, the intereſt only could be of any uſe, as the principal was ſettled upon children. Creditors were numerous and preſſing; there was no alternative but a jail, or the family manſion in Northumberland.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt, with a degree of reſolution

which might have been the preventative ten years before, of the evils, for which it was now ſcarcely an alleviation, ſold all his property, in or near town, and packing up his wife, himſelf, their three daughters, and one woman ſervant, in the only carriage they had left, this ruined family be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan their journey into Northumberland.</p>
                     <p>Maria, although ſhe had nothing to oppoſe to a meaſure ſo neceſſary and unavoidable, yet had not fortitude enough to ſubmit to it without the bittereſt lamentations, and the deepeſt grief: She parted from mrs. Forteſcue as if ſhe had been go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing into a Siberian exile, and mrs. Forteſcue her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf would, with leſs grief, have followed her to her grave, than thus have ſeen her, at eight and twenty, baniſhed from all that ſhe held valuable in life, and buried in the frightful glooms of a Northern ſolitude.

                     <p>GROBY MANOR was ſituate about thirty miles from the ſea coaſt, at the head of a narrow valley, the oppoſite ſides of which were formed by a variety of high and differently ſhaped hills, well wooded, with here and there a green meadow or a corn field i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>terſperſed. Through the valley ran a clear ſtream, and there were a variety of pleaſant and romantic walks on every ſide.</p>
                     <p>The houſe had, for many generations, been the reſidence of a reſpectable and well beloved family: It contained large and convenient rooms, and though the furniture was old, it was ſufficiently plentiful. The houſe was ſheltered from every cutting wind, and open only to a ſouthern expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure; it was warm and comfortable, proviſions and coals were cheap and abundant, there was a good library, and the air, clear and wholeſome, gave colour to the cheek, and vigour to the limbs.</p>
                     <p>Here, then, were ſources enough of enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, were the mind capable of reliſhing them; but mrs. Mordaunt ſeemed reſolved that as ſhe

was to be leſs happy than ſhe wiſhed to be, ſhe would be as miſerable as ſhe could. She paſſed her days in ſullen diſcontent and unavailing re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pining, refuſing all ſociety, and rendering thoſe who were obliged to approach her as miſerable as herſelf.</p>
                     <p>With mr. Mordaunt it was otherwiſe.— Having once broken the chains that tied him to a life he diſapproved, his natural temper began to manifeſt itſelf in beneficial effects to himſelf and all around him. He was delighted to be returned to the ſeat of his forefathers; joy ſprang in his heart at the ſight of the ſcenes of his infancy; he rejoiced to renew the ſocial connections of his former neighbourhood, and to buſy himſelf in the cares and occupations of a country life. He ſaw, with a ſatisfaction, that tranquilized his ſleeping, and gladdened his waking hours, that ten years of prudent retirement would clear his eſtate. In theſe ten years he hoped to recompenſe to his daughters, the evil they had hitherto received from neglect and ill education; and he conſidered the end as being ſcarcely more deſirable than the means.</p>
                     <p>He endeavoured, by gentleneſs and the kindeſt affection, to ſoften the mind of Mari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Here, my dear Maria (would he ſometimes ſay), <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

we neglect the only pure one, and which is now in our power? He had not, indeed, the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction to ſee ſhe was ſenſible either to his kindneſs, or his reaſoning; but he conſidered, that time only could overcome habits ſo deeply rooted as her's, and he was willing to wait patiently and good humouredly for its effects.</p>
                     <p>Twelve months were now elapſed ſince mr. Mordaunt's removal into the country, and Maria began to be ſomewhat more reconciled to her ſituation. She was not the leſs reconciled from obſerving the effect that the change in her manner of living had upon her beauty:—The regularity of her life, and the purity of the air, had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>luſhed her faded cheek with health, and had reſtored the luſtre to her eye, her limbs had recovered their roundneſs, and her complexion its tranſparency; ſhe heard the ruſtic praiſes of the peaſants when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſhe walked out, and her own maid had not ſo far forgotten her old trade, as not carefully to repeat, ſometimes with, and ſometimes without, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aggeration, the commendations that were retailed by ſervants from the dining parlours of their maſters.</p>
                     <p>She was conſcious of the diſguſt ſhe had given to all their neighbours on her firſt coming into the country; ſhe had then ſcarce thought it worth her while to remember the exiſtence of beings whom ſhe conſidered as little above the brute creation: but to the pleaſure of admiration it was not poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, while ſhe continued to breathe, that ſhe ſhould long be inſenſible. She endeavoured to apologize for her former conduct, by imputing it to ill health, and ſhe gave an appearance of truth to her apology, by now ſhewing a willingneſs to enter into ſociety, and to partake of ſuch pleaſure as the country afforded.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="17" facs="unknown:036127_0015_10084F29D73FB8A0"/>Her inſinuating manners, the ſuperiority of her breeding, and her uncommon beauty, adorned as it now was by graciouſneſs, ſoon made her the idol, or the envy, of all who approached her. Mr. Mordaunt could not but be pleaſed with this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement in his wife's temper: but he ſoon found it was confined wholly to thoſe hours when ſhe was engaged with company, either from home, or in her own houſe; he ſaw, with the moſt ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible mortification, that this amendment, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, aroſe only from the gratification of her va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity: to him ſhe was always alike cold and inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, always equally neglectful of her children, and intolerable to her domeſtics. Her grumblings and diſcontent when they were alone, were ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther increaſed than abated: ſhe ſullenly refuſed to take pleaſure in any of his plans or amuſements, and coldly withdrew her attention when he wiſhed to converſe, complained that his eagerneſs in his country purſuits, diſtracted her nerves; and would ſhut herſelf up in her room for a day together, altering an old bonnet, or new-modelling ſome of the ancient furniture.</p>
                     <p>Such a conduct, in ſpite of himſelf, gave mr. Mordaunt a bad opinion of her heart; and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually wore away all attachment or partiality but that which a confirmed habit, and the intimacy of their connection, preſerved in ſpite of his reaſon and his feelings.</p>

                     <p>HAD Maria been more amiable, they might now have been happy. They were now ſettled with a ſmall but comfortable eſtabliſhment, upon an equal footing with their neighbours, ſufficiently buſied to feel no want of employment, and ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciently idle to be in no danger of fatigue. They had no particular cares to moleſt them. They enjoyed health and a competency: and if they had not much to hope they had alſo not much to fear.</p>
                     <p>But, in a life where happineſs muſt ariſe from a diſcharge of duty alone, Maria found no charms. She was ſenſible only to wearineſs. As ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief from this eternal ſameneſs, ſhe was not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed to find herſelf with child. To give her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf more conſequence, and the circumſtance more intereſt, ſhe took it into her head to imagine that ſhe longed paſſionately for a boy. By talking perpetually on the ſubject, and expatiating on the maternal raptures ſhe was about to feel, and the maternal cares in which ſhe was henceforth to be engaged, ſhe had converted what was at firſt merely a whim, into a ſerious paſſion. She counted the months, the weeks as they paſſed. Every day might now complete her wiſhes. The hour came, and—ſhe was delivered of a daughter!</p>
                     <p>From the moment ſhe beheld her, the poor child's deſtiny, as far as it depended upon the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection of its mother, was decided. 'It was
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:036127_0017_10084F2FFB5F7298"/>
hideous. She ſaw every bad paſſion in its counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance. It looked like an owl, like an ape, like aunt Nelly.'—Invective could go no farther.</p>
                     <p>This aunt Nelly, the <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> of abhorrence, had been the ſiſter of mr. Mordaunt. Her breaſt was the manſion of every female virtue. She had been the being in the world, next to Maria, that mr. Mordaunt had moſt fondly loved. Being by many years his ſenior, ſhe had been the nurſe of his childhood, the gentle monitor of his youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful days, the warm and ſteady friend of his manly years. On his marriage, he had eagerly ſent for her to town, that ſhe might know and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>e known to one, whom he thought her only ſuperior. He told his Maria, 'that in the friendſhip of his ſiſter, ſhe would find all the advantage of ſuperior wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and perfect goodneſs. He did not bid her love her: he knew it was impoſſible ſhe ſhould do otherwiſe; and as to his ſiſter, ſhe would doat upon Maria as her child.'</p>
                     <p>All this might have been, and would have been, had Maria been the perſon mr. Mordaunt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved her to be. But, with her ſarcaſtic ſpirit, and ſelf conſequence, virtue and wiſdom, in the form of a plain, though intelligent looking wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of five and forty, were likely only to produce contempt and ſatire. She quarrelled with every feature in her face in the firſt half hour of their acquaintance; ridiculed her to her companions; ſcoffed at her to her woman<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained civility that ſhe thought proper to ſhew her before mr. Mordaunt evinced, to a woman of miſs Mordaunt's penetration, the averſion ſhe had taken to her. Nor was it leſs difficult to diſcover the miſtake that mr. Mordaunt had made in his choice: and Maria's averſion to her ſiſter-in-law
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:036127_0018_10084F3425466B60"/>
was increaſed by a conſciouſneſs that it could not be hid from her.</p>
                     <p>This averſion, however, might have worn off, could mrs. Mordaunt have found real cauſe for the contempt ſhe expreſſed towards miſs Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt: but ſhe ſoon was compelled to feel for this hated ſiſter, a reſpect, which her virtue in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired, and a dread which her underſtanding im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. This reſpect, this dread, converted diſlike into hatred. She was ſenſible, her conduct would juſtify animadverſion<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhe had no doubt but ſhe received it from miſs Mordaunt. She looked upon he<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> as a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>y; and hated her accordingly.</p>
                     <p>During mr. Mordaunt's reſidence in London, miſs Mordaunt had viſited town from time to time, for the purpoſe of ſeeing her brother. She had very early diſcovered that he was unhappy: and although he did not complain, ſhe perceived her company was a relief to him. She therefore never ſuffered twelve months to paſs without ſpending a few weeks in lodgings in town, contributing, by this means, all in her power toward his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and indulging herſelf in the pleaſure ſhe received from the company of his children. She endeavoured all ſhe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> could to counteract the evil they imbibed at home, and ſhe ſought, by every method, to inſpire them with love towards her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. In this latter particular, ſhe ſo completely ſucceeded, that the poor girls loved nothing half ſo well as aunt Nelly.</p>
                     <p>All theſe circumſtances confirmed Maria's ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred: and almoſt the only act of maternity ſhe ever exerciſed was, the giving her eldeſt girl a whipping, on her ſaying, as her mother was put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting on her morning bonnet, 'Now, mamma looks like aunt Nelly.'</p>

                        <pb n="21" facs="unknown:036127_0019_10084F35EDA0EC68"/>Two years before mr. Mordaunt's removal into the country, miſs Mordaunt had been ſeized with a diſorder which prevented her ſtirring from home; and having languiſhed under every painful circumſtances for eighteen months, ſhe had at length been releaſed from, and rewarded for her ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. Her death had been a ſevere affliction to mr. Mordaunt: and he cheriſhed her memory with the higheſt degree of tenderneſs and venera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. It was not, therefore, with mr. Mordaunt, that the ſuppoſed likeneſs of his new-born child to aunt Nelly, was likely to operate to her diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage; nor was the unreaſonable averſion that mrs. Mordaunt had taken to the poor infa<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> one whit more prejudicial to her with her father; for when he beheld the inveteracy with which his wife perſiſted in her deteſtation of ſo excellent a creature as his ſiſter had been, and when he compared the parade ſhe now made of her feelings, as a mother, with the abſolute neglect ſhe had hitherto ſhewn to her offspring, all partiality was for the moment at an end; and he viewed her with a degree of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation, that ſeemed to prohibit the poſſibility of its ever again being renewed.</p>
                     <p>There was one point, however, even on this ſubject, in which mr. and mrs. Mordaunt agreed: this was, in giving the name of Ellen to the poor little girl. Maria choſe it, that ſhe might gratify her ſpite in calling the child, "aunt Nelly;" and mr. Mordaunt was fond of perpetuating a name that had belonged to a ſiſter, whoſe memory (per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps by comparing her character with that of his wife) grew every day dearer to him.</p>

                     <p>IT was not merely in the airy nothing of a name that mrs. Mordaunt exerciſed her diſlike to her unhappy infant. The inextinguiſhable deſire that ſhe had of being ever the object of attention and obſervation, made her ſeek for means to perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuate her conſequence, when youth and beauty (however diſtant ſhe might at preſent conſider that period) ſhould be no more.</p>
                     <p>To be the principal object wherever ſhe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared, had been the firſt wiſh to which ſhe had been conſcious, and it was likely to be the laſt of which ſhe would be ſenſible. The faſhionable furor for education preſented her the means ſhe ſought. She could no longer eclipſe rival beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties at a ball: ſhe could no longer ſtrike the fangs of envy into a heart ſimilar to her own, by the ſuperior elegance of her head dreſs, or the ſplen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor of her equipage. All her triumphs were confined within the circle of a ſmall neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood, far remote from the ſcene of all her former diſtinctions, and where the inquiries of the cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious were more directed to the domeſtic economy of their neighbours, than to the form of their clothes, or the faſhion of their carriages. To

this neighbourhood ſhe reſolved to be known as the moſt educating mother in it. Her elder daughters were too old, and too much under the wiſer care of their father, to be proper objects on which to diſplay her abilities in this new road to diſtinction: but the new born infant was her undiſputed property, and ſhe reſolved to pour all the terrors of education on poor Ellen's head.</p>
                     <p>In this deſign, ſo wiſely and ſo benevolently formed, ſhe ſucceeded ſo perfectly, that at the early age of twelve months, when other children know their mothers only as their ſureſt ſource of indulgence, Maria was become ſo completely an object of terror to her child, that ſhe ſcarce looked upon her without trembling, or appeared before her without tears. It ſeemed too, as if every circumſtance was to conſpire to render the infancy of Ellen wretched. In leſs than fifteen months after her birth, the eagerly deſired boy was borne, and, as if this unnatural mother poſſe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> but a certain degree of affection, the little tenderneſs that ſhe had hitherto manifeſted towards Ellen, was all withdrawn, to be added to that which ſhe profuſely laviſhed on the boy. Beſides which, Ellen was always wrong in every thing ſhe did, or every thing ſhe did not do, for her brother. If ſhe careſſed him, ſhe would ſmother the child— If ſhe ſtood aloof, ſhe was a little inſenſible, without affections; and then ſhe had a flap or a puſh, or her play things were taken from her, or ſhe was ſometimes whipped, ſhe did not know for why, or for what.</p>
                     <p>The age of teaching now came on, and mrs. Mordaunt was reſolved to teach. But the truth was, that ſhe had never learn. Her own ideas of what ſhe meant to convey were too indiſtinct,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:036127_0022_10084F3F1F7DCC50"/>
to enable her to communicate them to another. Her method was unintelligible, and her impatience extreme. Ellen could learn nothing—it was ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity—it was obſtinacy. She had always fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told that ſhe had the worſt diſpoſitions of human nature—puniſhment followed puniſhment, 'till by a ſucceſſion of ſuch teaching and ſuch correc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that very ſtupidity and obſtinacy were nearly produced, which they were deſigned to correct.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt was not an inattentive ſpectator of all this; but he was far from underſtanding the real truth of the caſe. The early terror that had been impreſſed on the mind of Ellen, had made her appear, even to mr. Mordaunt, as a child of a ſlow capacity, and ſomewhat of a ſullen diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He was often witneſs to what were repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to him as fits of obſtinacy, and ſometimes to moments of violence. He feared Ellen might reſemble her mother, and thought a little cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection might be neceſſary. With the degree and frequency of the puniſhment he was wholly unacquainted: and as it is eaſy to put a child in the wrong, mrs. Mordaunt took care that Ellen ſhould always appear ſo to her father. But how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever mr. Mordaunt might, for a certain time, have been perſuaded, that his wife's mode of treating his daughter was ſalutary, or neceſſary, experience convinced him it was inefficacious. At ſix years old, Ellen could ſcarcely read: and he obſerved, with inexpreſſible pain, a ſullen indifference to all inſtruction or reproof pervading her mind.</p>
                     <p>Maria had never been her huſband's friend<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> for many years ſhe had ceaſed to be his confidant: and the ingenuous mind of mr. Mordaunt had ſuffered the ſevereſt mortification when he had found it neceſſary to ſacrifice the pleaſure of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:036127_0023_10084F4203D99498"/>
to the dictates of prudence. Since his reſidence in Northumberland, he had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>To mr. Thornton he revealed the fears and grief that the character of Ellen excited in his breaſt.</p>
                     <p>"Give me leave to invite my wife to make one of our party," ſaid mr. Thornton. "I am miſtaken if ſhe will not give you comfort."</p>
                     <p>Mrs Thornton was only in the next room. She obeyed her huſband's ſummons; ſhe ſat down, and heard mr. Mordaunt's diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>"Your child, my dear ſir," ſaid ſhe, "is neither ſtupid nor ill diſpoſed. Wrong methods have been taken with her. Terror has overwhelmed the powers of her mind, and deadened her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

                     <p>"How is it poſſible, madam," ſaid mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt, "that you ſhould have formed ſo contrary, and ſo much more favourable an opinion of Ellen, than I, with all my partiality, have been able to entertain?"</p>
                     <p>"She loves me, ſir," returned mrs. Thornton; "and ſhe loves me, becauſe ſhe believes I love her. If ſhe can love one perſon, ſhe can love another. She is willing to learn of me: and only the laſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <pb n="26" facs="unknown:036127_0024_10084F43D94EBE98"/>"No," cried mr. Mordaunt: "but I have farther favours to aſk of you. You muſt take this poor child under your care, my dear mrs. Thornton. You muſt take her and make her all you ſay ſhe is capable of being made."</p>
                     <p>After a little more converſation, all the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars of this plan were ſettled.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Thornton had long ſeen Ellen's ſufferings with pity; and was happy to contribute all in her power to put an end to them. Mrs. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt, convinced that Ellen would do no credit to her mode of education, and tired of the trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſhe gave her, eaſily conſented to part with her.</p>
                     <p>The parſonage, to which Ellen was now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved, was ſcarcely half a mile diſtant from Groby Manor: and it was ſituated at the other end of the valley. So near a neighbourhood en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>abled mr. Mordaunt to ſee his daughter every day; and he ſaw her every day with increaſed ſatisfaction. Her pallid cheeks, hitherto robbed of their colour, by the continual waſhing of tears, began to be tinged with a faint red. Her ſullen eye, formerly fixed gloomily on the ground, was often now raiſed timidly to the perſon who ſpoke to her, and ſometimes caſt forth beams of intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence and gaiety. If ſhe did not run to meet her father when he approached her, ſhe ventured to preſs the hand that held her's: and ſometimes would ſhe reſt her head upon his ſhoulder: and he could perceive, as ſhe raiſed it, a tear tremble in her eye, which he could attribute only to the tenderneſs of her heart, reſponſive to its care<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Mr. Mordaunt left no method untried to ſecure her affections: and every day now gave him a

more perfect aſſurance that he was not unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful.</p>
                     <p>Ellen had been about ſix months in her new ſituation, when the illneſs of lord Villars called mr. and mrs. Mordaunt into Hampſhire. His in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſpoſition was long, and terminated in his death.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Mordaunt, very well pleaſed to find her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf once again in her old world, caught at every poſſible reaſon for prolonging her ſtay. Her bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, now lord Villars, had been married ſome years. She had ſeen little of him during this period. He preſſed her ſo much to continue in Hampſhire the remainder of the ſummer, that mr. Mordaunt conſented ſhe ſhould do ſo. But he conſented upon condition that their three elder daughters ſhould join them there. He thought it deſirable to have them known to their neareſt connexions: and he was willing to give them ſuch aſſiſtances, in ſome exterior accompliſhments, as the diſtant ſituation of Northumberland had not hitherto allowed them. The boy had never been ſeparated from his mother.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt's condition was joyfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted. The ſummer paſſed pleaſantly with them all: and when the time for repairing to London approached, mrs. Forteſcue (now a widow) ſo vehemently urged the melancholy of returning into Northumberland at that ſeaſon, and ſo kindly offered the whole family apartments in her houſe, that mr. Mordaunt again conſented to prolong his abſence from home.</p>
                     <p>The family had not been ſettled more than a month in town, when mrs. Forteſcue was ſeized with a fever, of which ſhe died in about a fort<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night. On her death is was found ſhe had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queathed to m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

power to diſpoſe of. This all conſiſted in a ſmall country manſion, with an eſtate of about 200l. a year about it. It was ſituated within ten miles of lord Villars's houſe, in the country; and was furniſhed and fitted up with all the elegance of modern taſte.</p>
                     <p>Whatever tears mrs. Mordaunt might ſhed for the loſs of a partial, though miſtaken, friend—for one, who had not only been her ſteady advocate through life, but who had proved her benefactreſs at her death, were ſoon dried up by the thoughts of the independence that friend had ſecured to her, and ſtill more by reflections on the place where the property which gave her that independ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence was ſituated. She immediately declared her intentions of going to Hadley Lodge directly upon leaving town. But ſhe alſo proteſted, that ſhe meant not to leave London 'till the middle of June. The houſe ſhe was at preſent in was to continue her's for ſix months, and ſhe therefore ſaw no reaſon why the event of mrs. Forteſcue's death ſhould abridge the ſcheme of pleaſure that ſhe had laid down for theenſuing ſpring.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt felt it harſh to oppoſe any of theſe reſolutions, ſince they were not (in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of their new acquiſitions) liable to the cenſure of imprudence in a pecuniary light. He therefore acquieſced, reſerving however to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the power of viſiting Ellen and Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: and this he propoſed to do when mrs. Mordaunt and her family removed to Hadley Lodge.</p>
                     <p>In the execution of this plan, he was, however, prevented. The death of a diſtant relation, who had for many years reſided in the Weſt-Indies, made it neceſſary he ſhould himſelf croſs the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic.

Property of ſome value had devolved to him; but the ſucceſſion of it was diſputed: and it was attended with ſome circumſtances that made it neceſſary, if he meant to proſecute his claim to it, to viſit the iſland where it lay.</p>
                     <p>He would willingly have perſuaded mrs. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt to have re<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Mordaunt's feelings would not permit; it was therefore agreed that ſhe ſhould reſide at her own houſe while he was abſent, and he flattered him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that the neighbourhood of her brother might be ſome reſtraint upon her indiſcretion, and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford protection and counſel to his girls, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The time was ſhort in which he was to arrange all this; he recommended his family to lord Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and ſailed for Jamaica.</p>
                     <p>By unforeſeen circumſtances and unavoidable delays, his abſence was prolonged to the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of the fifth year, and he returned ſomething poorer than he ſat out.</p>
                     <p>Immediately on his arrival in England mr. Mordaunt haſtened to Hadley Lodge, but no comfort awaited him there—He found his eldeſt daughter married to a man of libertine character and diſſipated fortune, whoſe recommendation, in the eyes of mrs. Mordaunt, had been his faſhionable manners, and his connexions with people of rank.</p>
                     <p>The boy, now ten years old, had continued,
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:036127_0028_10084F5187772200"/>
in ſpite of mrs. Mordaunt's repeated injunctions to the contrary, in his mother's houſe, where he had remained ignorant of every thing he ought to have learnt, and became acquainted with almoſt every thing he ought not to have known.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Mordaunt herſelf was embarraſſed with debts, and of the independence, of which ſhe had made ſo ill a uſe, but little remained.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt could ſcarcely forbear reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing lord Villars for the little attention he appeared to have given to his ſiſter and her children; but when he conſidered that he had himſelf the cares of a large family upon him, and a numerous train of half brothers and ſiſters, whoſe intereſt he was compelled to attend to, and reflected upon his character, in which ſelfiſhneſs was the predo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minant feature, he thought it beſt to forbear re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches, which would now be made in vain, and which might tend to interrupt the friendly inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe there had hitherto ſubſiſted between him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf and lord Villars. In reproaches to himſelf, however, he was not ſparing: he felt too bitterly, the conſequences of his ill choice in a wife, not to call him ſeverely to an account for having ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered his eyes to miſlead his judgment.</p>
                     <p>Northumberland was again the reſource: and as mrs. Mordaunt had now no power to remain in Hampſhire without the permiſſion of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, ſhe knew it was in vain to oppoſe her wiſhes to his, ſhe therefore prepared, however reluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly, for her departure; but the delays which ſhe artfully threw in the way, having exhauſted mr. Mordaunt's patience, he left her to follow him at her leiſure, and ſet out for Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, accompanied only by the ſecond ſon of lord Villars, a youth of fifteen.</p>

Mordaunt's baneful in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence, ſhe might compenſate to him for all the other domeſtic diſappointments that influence had produced; at others, the remembrance of thoſe faults which he had been accuſtomed to call na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to her diſpoſition, recurred to his mind, and overclouded it with the diſpiriting fear that no difference of treatment could have been powerful enough to correct them; yet mrs. Thornton, though ſhe had ſaid nothing of her mental abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, had ſpoken much of her docility. If I find her, ſaid mr. Mordaunt to himſelf, gentle and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate, I will compound for a moderate ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, and give up willingly all pretenſions to talents or accompliſhments.</p>
                     <p>Theſe thoughts occupied him ſo much, that not all the comicality and ſprightly underſtanding of his companion could always awake him from
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:036127_0030_10084F5633FAB3A0"/>
his reverie: and Henry, who had as much feeling as gaiety, impoſed ſilence upon himſelf, that he might not prove troubleſome to his uncle.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt reſted not a moment at Groby Manor; but with a long ſtep, and haſty move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that made Henry laugh, proceeded down the valley to the parſonage.</p>
                     <p>As he approached the houſe he heard the ſound of a fiddle; and immediately after ſaw aſſembled on the green before the door, ten or twelve girls of different ages, who were dancing gaily to the muſic. Mr. Mordaunt ſtopped ſhort. He ſought, if poſſible, to diſcover Ellen before ſhe was pointed out to him; and Henry ruſhed forward that he might join in the amuſement.</p>
                     <p>"Might that be her," ſaid mr. Mordaunt, "might that ſpright', good-humoured looking blooming girl be her, my wiſhes would be more than anſwered."</p>
                     <p>His wiſhes were more than anſwered. It was Ellen herſelf. The muſic ceaſed. The whole group was in confuſion: and the next moment Ellen, with an emotion that charmed him, was in the arms of her father.</p>
                     <p>"My dear child, my beloved Ellen, can I ever part with you again?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, yes, this very moment, my dear uncle," cried Henry. "What! am I not to have a dozen kiſſes at leaſt of my couſin?"</p>
                     <p>"And are you my couſin, <hi>too?</hi>" ſaid Ellen, with one arm round her father's neck, and the other hand held out to Henry. "O, I did not know I was ever to have been ſo happy!"</p>
                     <p>The pathos of the ſcene was now over: but the delight remained: and Henry, having taken ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing more than his dozen kiſſes, ran away with
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:036127_0031_10084F58D9E1D6D8"/>
Ellen to join her companions, and recommence the dance.</p>
                     <p>"You never told me," ſaid mr. Mordaunt to mr. Thornton, "of the good-humour and intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence that beam in Ellen's countenance, nor of the lightneſs of her movements, the delicacy of her limbs, and the eaſe of her ſhape."</p>
                     <p>"Ellen is not a beauty," ſaid mrs. Thornton, ſmiling.</p>
                     <p>"She is in her father's eyes," returned mr. Mordaunt: "and will be ſo in thoſe of her lover."</p>
                     <p>"But you do not aſk, what I have attempted to teach her. You do not inquire, whether ſhe was capable of learning."</p>
                     <p>"I am almoſt indifferent what ſhe has learnt. With the diſpoſitions that I ſee ſhe poſſeſſes, ſhe will gratify my fondeſt wiſhes."</p>
                     <p>"But Ellen has not only diſpoſitions," ſaid mr. Thornton, "ſhe has powers. She is an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent arithmetician: ſhe is a good geographer: ſhe is miſtreſs of all the rules of drawing: ſhe writes and ſpeaks French well; and has a very competent knowlege of Latin."</p>
                     <p>"To which let me add," ſaid mrs. Thornton, "that ſhe is miſtreſs of her needle; underſtands muſic tolerably; plays at cheſs; and dances, walks, and plays at ſhuttlecock to admiration."</p>
                     <p>"Impoſſible!" ſaid mr. Mordaunt. "You flatter me."</p>
                     <p>"Nothing can be more true; and yet Ellen is no prodigy. She is what every girl of common ſenſe and common application may be at her age."</p>
                     <p>"But how did you conquer her obſtinacy? how did you ſubdue her violence?"</p>
                     <p>"I neither found her obſtinate nor violent. I

did not propoſe to her to do any thing but what ſhe ſaw my own daughter, ſomething younger than herſelf, do. Each day has its allotted buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and its allotted pleaſure. The ſloweſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity could comprehend, that the more hours were conſumed in buſineſs, the fewer there would be for pleaſure.

If that concluſion be as infallible as it is unpleaſant, in a little time it will be carefully avoided. To the reaſon of its inſtructors a child will not perhaps readily ſubmit. It is againſt reaſon that it ſhould. But to the reaſon of facts children will always yield, provided it be made clear to them."</p>
                     <p>"Can it really be ſo eaſy to give the beſt poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible education to a child?"</p>
                     <p>"I do not ſay, that mine is the beſt poſſible education; nor is it ſo eaſy as it appears. To guard againſt the faults of the child is not half the buſineſs. The weakneſs of the tutor is much more inimical to the ſucceſs of his efforts—to be unyielding in matters (ſimply conſidered) of little import—to bear a cold countenance with a warm heart—to be inſenſible to the blandiſhments of childhood, where the good of the future man re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires it—are not eaſy taſks to a feeling and affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionate mind; and no other is fitted for the taſk of education. Then will not the tutor have to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bat with his own indolence, his own unevenneſs of diſpoſition, his caprice, and his partialities? No, the taſk of education is not eaſy; but it is the greateſt in which man or woman can be engaged; and ought therefore to be attended to by all who undertake it, with every energy of the mind. What I have chiefly wiſhed to avoid, was the doing too
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:036127_0033_10084F5F9B7530A8"/>
much. Not to do miſchief, and to let the cauſes that produce good have their full operation, are two material points. I was aware, that the greateſt difficulty, in this important matter, aroſe from the weakneſſes of the inſtructors, and the indiſcreet interference of others. Mr. Thornton and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Hence Ellen and Mary have learnt to conſider our laws as immutable as the decrees of fate, and to accommodate themſelves to them, as they would do to any phyſical neceſſity. Conſtant application has made the taſk of learning eaſy: and where ſomething new, however little, is acquired every day, the ſum total, at the end of five years, will be ſurpriſing."</p>
                     <p>"But do you allow nothing to natural diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and to the natural powers of the mind?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh, yes, a great deal: And here, I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge that Ellen has met my cares more than half way. She has a very good, but not an uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon capacity. Her quickneſs of apprehenſion, however, is ſomething more than common. She has a warm heart and a generous mind. I have been able to move her with the touch of a finger. Had ſhe had duller feelings, I muſt have put my whole ſtrength to her."</p>
                     <p>"Your method of teaching ſeems not only cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to produce the immediate end, that of communicating the thing to be taught, but alſo to give an anticipated experience of life. Will there not be learnt by it, that yielding to the neceſſity of things, which is the beſt ſecret for happineſs, and which enables us to repreſs uſeleſs repinings, and, when we cannot be happy one way, to be happy another?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="36" facs="unknown:036127_0034_10084F63EB532FC0"/>"It is what I hope from it: and without ſome ſuch end, all the teachings in the world are only calculated to deſtroy the pleaſures of childhood, without having a tendency to promote the virtue or the happineſs of the man. I know not what may be Ellen's deſtiny: but I think I can dare to foretel, that if her preſent habits are allowed to ſtrengthen, and her preſent principles to take root, ſhe will never in any circumſtance, be the victim of ungoverned fancy, or the martyr to a ſelfiſh ſenſibility."</p>
                     <p>"But is there not ſome danger in thus guarding her from a too great influence of the feelings, that ſhe ſhould become leſs amiable by the want of them?"</p>
                     <p>"I do not guard her from feeling. I guard her from ſelfiſhneſs. For others ſhe will feel acutely—for herſelf moderately: and where ſelf is out of the queſtion, there is no fear but that reaſon will always be near enough to ward off any danger from too lively a ſenſibility."</p>
                     <p>"What is the leading feature of her mind? What is it that ſhe is extremely?"—</p>
                     <p>"Ellen knows no extremes."</p>
                     <p>"Except," interrupted mr. Thornton, "the extreme of good-humour."</p>
                     <p>"Were I to have made the exception," ſaid mrs. Thornton, "it would have been that of diſintereſtedneſs. But let us recollect that we are ſpeaking of a girl of twelve years old. She is yet really nothing. All the intimations that ſhe gives of character, are favourable. But, alas! how much ſix years of weak indulgence, or cold neglect, may make the woman of eighteen, differ from the girl of twelve!"</p>
                     <p>"She has neither the one nor the other to fear,"
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:036127_0035_10084F6577D4C150"/>
ſaid mr. Mordaunt warmly, "if you will continue your cares."</p>
                     <p>"If I will!—"</p>
                     <p>"My obligations," interrupted mr. Mordaunt, "will then be ſuch as can never be diſcharged. And—"</p>
                     <p>"Talk not of obligations," ſaid mr. Thornton. "be aſſured they are reciprocal: and if you truſt your Ellen with us another ſix years, they will all be on our ſide. Hitherto ſhe has only acquired the means of ſelf improvement; from this time, every day will add ſomething to the real improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of her mind, and the formation of her heart: And do you not think, that thoſe who are to accompany the traveller in ſo flowery a way, will be more than repaid for the fatigue of the journey?"</p>
                     <p>The converſation was here interrupted by the breaking up of the ball: and Ellen ſideling to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her father, found herſelf a ſeat upon half his chair.</p>
                     <p>It is not to be doubted, that from this evening mr. Mordaunt ſpent many of his hours at the parſonage: Henry ſpent ſtill more. With Ellen he ſtudied, and with Ellen he idled. She was the better ſcholar of the two; and would laugh at the careleſs manner in which he had been taught, would ſcoff at his want of application, and pique him to greater exertion by her ridicule. When books gave way to ſports, they walked, danced, or played at ſhuttlecock together; or Henry would aſſiſt Ellen and Mary in the labours of their garden; or they would compel him to liſten to ſome of their botanical diſcuſſions, bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tany being a new ſtudy which mr. Thornton had juſt given them. But as to cheſs, which equally
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:036127_0036_10084F6C233E27E0"/>
excluded converſation and locomotion, Henry had never patience to hear it mentioned. For muſic he had little more toleration, except Ellen would ſing a ballad or play a country dance.</p>
                     <p>Six weeks were thus paſſed away: and mrs. Mordaunt had not yet fulfilled her promiſe of following her huſband: he, therefore, thought it moſt prudent to return into Hampſhire, and not to quit it, 'till he brought her away with him. Henry's vacation was more than expired. He muſt depart with his uncle; and Ellen declared, with as much naïveté as truth, that ſhe knew not which ſhe was moſt ſorry to part with. She bade them farewel with a degree of pain which ſhe never before remembered to have felt. But ſhe had no leiſure for artificial grief. It was rather the recollections that were forced upon her, than any ſhe indulged in, that ſaddened, for ſome days after their departure, both her leſſons and her amuſements. But a much more ſerious grief awaited her.</p>

                     <p>ELLEN retained only an indiſtinct idea of the ſeverity and ill will of her mother towards her during her infancy. All remembrance of it had been, by the cares of mrs. Thornton, as much obliterated as poſſible. Thus, though ſhe did not look forward to the arrival of mrs. Mordaunt with the ſame delight and deſire which ſhe had felt when ſhe expected her father, ſhe nevertheleſs thought of it with pleaſure: and the expectation of ſeeing her ſiſters, filled her with hopes ſtill more ſatisfactory to her feelings.</p>
                     <p>The firſt evening ſpent in their company re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed this pleaſure, and chilled her hopes.</p>
                     <p>The immediate impulſe, on the ſight of her mother, had been to fly into her arms: but ſhe had ſtopped ſhort, checked by the frigidity of her air, and the ſcowling diſcontent of her brow. She waited for invitation,—but ſhe received it not: and ſhe ſtood ſilent and depreſſed, with her eyes caſt upon the ground, unconſcious what could have been her fault, yet feeling that ſhe muſt have committed one.</p>
                     <p>"Maria," ſaid mr. Mordaunt, "Ellen longs to embrace you."</p>
                     <p>"There, child," ſaid Maria, coldly kiſſing her forehead, "I hope you are grown good. But you uſed to be the naughtieſt little brat I was ever ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:036127_0038_10084F70B0DAAB08"/>
with. Many are the twigs of birch I have worn out in your ſervice."</p>
                     <p>Tears ſtarted into poor Ellen's eyes. She had nothing to ſay; nor did ſhe know clearly at that moment what ſhe thought. But ſhe felt that ſhe wiſhed herſelf away.</p>
                     <p>Her ſiſters had no ill will towards her; but ſhe was not an object of any intereſt in their eyes. Vitiated by their mother's precepts and example, they conſidered the having quitted the South of England, as having left every thing that was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable in life—as the forfeiture of all their hopes of eſtabliſhment in the world—and, indeed, as the conſummation of misfortune. Their journey, therefore, had been ſpent in tears and regret. Groby Manor appeared to them as a priſon, in which, for the future, their only happineſs muſt ariſe from enumerating delights that were gone for ever, and in talking of perſons who were to be ſeen no more. To all, of which Ellen could ſpeak, they were perfectly indifferent. They were too indolent to enter into her exerciſes, and too ignorant to care about her ſtudies.</p>
                     <p>Ellen ſenſibly felt her diſappointment, a diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment that every future day confirmed.</p>
                     <p>Her mother added ill humour and diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation to her coldneſs: and though it was no longer in her power to puniſh, or to control her, it was more than ſufficiently ſo to mortify and to thwart her. There was no opportunity that occurred of doing either, that ſhe ever ſuffered to eſcape. Her diſlike to Ellen was, indeed, little, if at all, ſhort of hatred. She could not conceal from herſelf how falſe had been the character which, in her early years, ſhe had ſought to ſtamp her with. Her underſtanding and temper, however, now
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:036127_0039_10084F7389BF1A18"/>
appeared both to be indubitably excellent: and mrs. Mordaunt was fully aware of the concluſion that muſt be drawn by every body, that if ſuch ſoil had not from the firſt produced fruit, it muſt have been wholly owing to the unſkilfulneſs of the cultivator. She therefore conſidered Ellen's merits and acquirements, as reproaches to herſelf, and as a moſt ſevere mortification to her vanity; and as ſhe could not, with all her depreciation of them, leſſen their real value; ſhe hated Ellen as the cauſe of her daily and hourly mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation.</p>
                     <p>It was more by the ſelf indulgence of railing at Ellen, than from any fixed deſign, that mrs. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt communicated her prejudices to the hearts of her daughters. Theſe prejudices were aided by the diſcovery that they ſoon made, that Ellen, though ſo far ſhort of them in years, was their ſuperior in every kind of uſeful knowledge. They found ſhe every day grew into more conſideration: and the juſt preference that mr. Mordaunt gave her in his affections, though they did not by any effort towards imitating her excellencies endeavour to leſſen, filled them with the moſt rancorous jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſy. They ſhrunk from all Ellen's playful and affectionate attempts towards being upon a fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar footing with them: and ſhe was ſoon pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully convinced, that ſhe was to look for no friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip from her ſiſters.</p>
                     <p>All mr. Mordaunt's efforts to eſtabliſh harmony and mutual love among the individuals of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily were in vain. It ſoon came to be conſidered as compoſed of two parties, of which mrs. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt and her two eldeſt daughters formed one, and mr. Mordaunt and Ellen the other. The boy
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:036127_0040_10084F770CD41A78"/>
he had reſolutely divided from his mother, and placed under the care of a friend of his own, from whoſe aſſiduity he hoped he might derive advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages, that would, in ſome meaſure, make up for the years that had been miſpent.</p>
                     <p>"If," ſaid he to mrs. Thornton, with a ſigh of the bittereſt ſelf-reproach, "if I am to do juſtice to the underſtandings of my children, or to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their hearts from ſelfiſhneſs and vanity, it muſt be by removing them from the influence of a woman whom I once imagined poſſeſſed of every virtue that adorns humanity."</p>
                     <p>"Ah, my dear friend," ſaid mr. Thornton, "your miſtake is not an uncommon one. The faſcination of beauty always has prevailed, and always will prevail. We can only render it harm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs, by giving to our females ſuch educations as will place all the uſeful energies of the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and all the virtuous propenſities of the heart, in conjunction with perſonal charms. If this can be done, the whole of human kind will bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit."</p>
                     <p>Ellen diſappointed in the reciprocation of affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and pleaſure which ſhe had hoped for from her own family, applied herſelf cloſer than ever to her leſſons: and the kindneſs of mr. and mrs. Thornton, with the friendſhip of their daughter, ſhe found no inadequate compenſation for the contrary ſentiments that filled the boſoms of her mother and ſiſters.</p>
                     <p>The following ſummer again brought Henry into Northumberland. He and Ellen met with mutual delight: and this delight increaſed with every hour they paſſed together.</p>
                     <p>If Henry had been the companion and play-fellow
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:036127_0041_10084F7ACE0E6B50"/>
of Ellen, when firſt they knew each other, he now became her friend. Ellen had already ſorrows to diſburden. The invincible ſilence and apparent unconſciouſneſs of both mr. and mrs. Thornton, as to the conduct of her mother and ſiſters towards her, left Ellen at a loſs to know whether it was perceived by them or no. But ſuch reſerve on their part made appear the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of her continuing equally ſilent, and ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly unconſcious. From a feeling of delicacy, ſhe was not more communicative to Mary.</p>
                     <p>But with Henry ſhe had no concealments. His quick ſenſe had inſtantly revealed to him the unkindneſs of his aunt and couſins: and the warmth of his heart and temper led him to ſpeak of it to Ellen, in terms of honeſt indignation. Ellen was not angry; but ſhe was grieved. She lamented her own inability to conciliate the affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of thoſe by whom ſhe moſt wiſhed to be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, and to love: and Henry being made ſtill more angry by ſeeing her grief, declared them, in expreſs terms, to be unworthy of her ſolicitude or regret.</p>
                     <p>Henry's partiality for Ellen, was an additional motive to her mother's hatred, and her ſiſters' jealouſy. Mrs. Mordaunt had hitherto boaſted of her nephew as the ornament and pride of her <hi>own</hi> family: and ſhe could not but look upon it as a degradation to the dignity of that family, to ſee him give the moſt unequivocal manifeſtations of preferable attachment to that child of hers, whoſe birth, ſhe ſcrupled not to declare, ſhe conſidered as her greateſt misfortune.</p>
                     <p>Henry, with ſomething of a malicious archneſs, was ſo far from concealing his partiality in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliment
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:036127_0042_10084F7C57E07CE0"/>
to his aunt, that he took every opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of diſplaying it before her, and of magnify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the merits and acquirements of Ellen, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond all other merits and acquirements. He needed not this method for the confirmation of a paſſion that had taken deep root in his heart.</p>

                     <p>EVERY vacation, while Henry continued at ſchool, and many days that were not vacation, when by his removal to college he became more his own maſter, were ſpent by him, upon ſome pretence or other, at Groby Manor. Each time he ſaw Ellen his attachment increaſed, for each time ſhe appeared more amiable and charming in his eyes.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps the moſt unſuſpicious proof of a good education is, that the progreſs of time is marked by the progreſs of improvement in the pupil. Ellen gave this proof of the goodneſs of her education. Every ſix months ſhe had made ſome acquiſition in knowledge, or gave ſome proof that her reaſon ſtrengthened, and that her paſſions were more under control. Good habits were converted into virtues; and warm affections ripened into bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence.</p>
                     <p>Thoſe who beſtow the name of education on a deſultory form of inſtruction, often ſuſpended through idleneſs, or broken in upon by frivolous and pernicious amuſements, whoſe efforts, weak as they are, are directed wholly to filling the head, rather than to forming the heart, or cultivating

the reaſon, cannot gueſs, and will not be made to believe, how much uſeful knowledge, how much vigour of mind, how much ſtrength of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple, may be produced by eleven years of wiſely directed and unremitted attention to thoſe objects.</p>
                     <p>Ellen at ſeventeen, with all the gaiety that belongs to that age, poſſeſſed great acuteneſs of diſcernment, much power of reaſon, an invincible integrity, and a command over her paſſions, which is not often met with in the moſt advanced years. Her mind was ſtored with uſeful and ornamental learning. Her perſon was light and agile. She had the prettieſt hands and feet in the world. Her countenance was frank and intelligent: and her complexion clear and blooming. No one would have fallen in love with Ellen for her beauty; but, being in love with her, every one muſt have thought her beautiful.</p>
                     <p>Henry could now ſit whole hours with her at cheſs, or hanging over the back of her chair. Any ſound that ſhe drew from her harpſichord had power to rivet him to the ſpot. Ellen could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mark on the difference of his taſte now and in former times: but ſhe was not conſcious of the change that had taken place in the nature of his attachment. Her's towards him, was lively and animated, as it had always been. But being ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to love him only as her couſin, ſhe thought ſhe loved him as her couſin ſtill.</p>
                     <p>Henry, however, now twenty, was no ſtranger to the nature of the paſſion which wholly occupied his mind; and being challenged upon it by his uncle, frankly declared that his hope and deſign were to gain the heart of Ellen, and that, having gained it, no earthly conſideration ſhould make him forego the poſſeſſion of her perſon.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="47" facs="unknown:036127_0045_1008386A97870A70"/>"But your father?"—</p>
                     <p>"My father has no claims upon me but thoſe of nature. I am no eldeſt ſon, thank heaven. To me cannot be pleaded either the pride or the ava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rice of my family. I am deſtined to work out my own ſupport; and by that deſtiny my inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence is ſecured. Oh! my uncle, give me leave to try to gain the affections of Ellen. Do you ratify the gift, and my father neither will or can have any objection to our union."</p>
                     <p>"It is at leaſt fit you conſult him before you attempt to gain a heart, which, even if gained, ought not, without his concurrence, and, I flatter myſelf, would not remain yours."</p>
                     <p>Oh! thought Henry, if I were once aſſured of Ellen's heart, the way would be eaſy.</p>
                     <p>"Will you, ſir, explain my hopes and my wiſhes to my father? You know I have never attempted concealment. I have always thought I had a right, as one born to independence—the independence that induſtry gives—to indulge in a love which has poſſeſſed my heart from the firſt weeks of my knowledge of Ellen, and which will never depart from it but with my lateſt ſigh."</p>
                     <p>"I love your frankneſs, and I love your ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour: but I muſt tell you, you are miſtaken in your idea of independence. What are you, what can you be for many years to come, unſupported by your father? It is for him to ſay how you ſhall exert your induſtry, what aſſiſtances he will give to it, and what returns he may expect from the ſucceſs of it, before you can conſider yourſelf as being, or pretend to act as, an independent perſon."</p>
                     <p>"But you, ſir," ſaid Henry lowering his tone, "but you, ſir, could be favourable to my wiſhes."</p>
                     <p>"I ſhall be, I muſt be, ruled by your father.
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:036127_0046_10084F89DAE4C018"/>
All I can give Ellen will be little; and I ſhall never conſent to her becoming the wife of any man againſt the conſent of his parent."</p>
                     <p>Henry's hopes ſeemed to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>otter to the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. "What would you have me to do, ſir?" ſaid he faintly. "I will put myſelf under your direction. I wiſh to conſider you as my father."</p>
                     <p>"What I <hi>require</hi> from you is to quit Groby Manor. I would guard Ellen from all unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary pain; and therefore if you are not to be united, I would ſpare her the pang of a diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed hope. At preſent, with all your inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuating qualities, young man, I believe your heart is free."</p>
                     <p>"This is what you require of me," ſaid Henry impatiently: "what is it that you adviſe?"</p>
                     <p>"That you open your mind fully to your father, and that you act implicitly as he ſhall direct."</p>
                     <p>"And ſuppoſe he forbids me to think any more of Ellen, do you ſuppoſe I can obey him?"</p>
                     <p>"Indeed I do; becauſe you ought."</p>
                     <p>"And could you, ſir, at my age?"</p>
                     <p>"Aſk me no queſtions. If you hope for my intereſt, you muſt do what I require and adviſe."</p>
                     <p>"With ſuch a bribe, what is it I would not do? I will be gone this very evening, nay, within this hour. If I were to ſee Ellen again, who knows but I might whiſper a ſecret in her ear, that might make her not unintereſted in the ſucceſs of my journey."</p>
                     <p>"Go; and my good wiſhes go with you. If you can add perſeverance to your activity, you may in time have the independence you talk
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:036127_0047_10084F8B63585ED0"/>
of; and I may have the pleaſure to receive you as my ſon."</p>
                     <p>Henry preſſed his uncle's hand between both his in ſpeechleſs agitation, and ran off to conceal his falling tears.</p>
                     <p>Henry's journey was ſpeedy, and not wholly unſucceſsful. Marriage, according to the deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of lord Villars, was to be put wholly out of the queſtion for ſome years: but Henry was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed, upon thoſe terms, to endeavour to attach Ellen to himſelf: and lord Villars promiſed, when his ſon could prove to him that he was maſter of the annual ſum of five hundred pounds, as the fruits of his own induſtry, that he ſhould then be allowed to make her his wife. His profeſſion was to be the law. Three hundred pounds a year lord Villars propoſed to allow him; and he engaged to continue this ſum 'till Henry by his own efforts made the five hundred pounds per annum eight.</p>
                     <p>Henry already thought himſelf the huſband of Ellen; but lord Villars's views were very different. By removing the poſſibility of a connexion, which it was not his deſire ſhould ever take place, to ſo diſtant and uncertain a period, he depended upon the viciſſitude of human events, and the inſtability of human affections. He knew, much better than Henry, how long it muſt of neceſſity be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he could perform his part of the engagement: and in the lapſe of ſo many years, he made ſure of his calculation, that either the power to do ſo, or the will, would be loſt. He might indeed have refuſed his conſent altogether, but he had many reaſons for not doing this. Although ſteady and unbending as to the end he had in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>iew, the means he always choſe ſhould be the
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:036127_0048_10084F8CF6475ED8"/>
gentleſt poſſible. Experience had long confirmed him in the policy of ſuch proceeding. If they ſucceeded at all, their ſucceſs was more complete than any which violence could produce: and if violence muſt be reſorted to, it ever operated with double force for having been for ſome time withheld.</p>
                     <p>In this caſe he particularly attended to the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of Henry; the energy of whoſe mind he knew would be up in arms againſt manifeſt injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice or manifeſt unreaſonableneſs. It ſuited nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther his family views, nor his intereſt to be at va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riance with a ſon, whoſe ſuperiority of character he was willing to make the inſtrument of family aggrandizement. He was not inattentive either to the advantage to be derived from curbing the paſſions and indiſcretions of a young man, or of the ſpur that might be given to his induſtry, by the bait of a promiſed marriage with the woman of his choice, as a reward for his virtue and his exertions. But in thus holding forth the ſugar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plumb for good behaviour, he by no means yielded the power of the rod which was ſtill to be exerciſed, if after circumſtances made it neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>Henry comprehended nothing of all this. He relied equally on the good faith of his father and his own conſtancy; and thanking lord Villars for his indulgence with the moſt enraptured gratitude, meaſured back his ſteps to Northumberland.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt thought lord Villars's deciſion both wiſe and kind; and moſt willingly gave Henry permiſſion to gain the heart of Ellen, if he could.</p>
                     <p>In the character of Henry mr. Mordaunt ſaw the ſeeds of all thoſe qualities that he could wiſh for in a huſband for his daughter. But, had he
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:036127_0049_10084F8E807A73A8"/>
been independent, and his wiſhes ſanctioned by the approbation of lord Villars, mr. Mordaunt would not willingly have truſted, at the early and tempeſtuous age of twenty, the happineſs of Ellen to his care. His diſpoſition was too ardent, and his taſte for pleaſure too eager, to have given a reaſonable hope, that having thus early attained the ſummit of his wiſhes, the reſt of his life would be regulated by the dictates of reaſon, or even that the object which had ſo eaſily been obtained, however now highly prized, would be able to maintain its value in his eſtimation. But in the diſcipline of a ſeven or eight years' ſtudy of the law, with Ellen for his reward, mr. Mordaunt ſaw a courſe of education for Henry, that would, he doubted not, give ſtability to all his virtues, and train him to that power of mind, and recti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of feeling, which would ſecure both her happineſs and his own.</p>
                     <p>All theſe arrangements were received by mrs. Mordaunt with a ſullen diſcontent. She ſmiled ſcornfully at the idea of an engagement between a boy and a girl, the accompliſhment of which was not to take place until ſo diſtant a period of time: and ſhe expreſſed a wonder that her brother would ever conſent to ſo fooliſh a contract. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever as the completion of it opened no views of ſplendour or greatneſs to Ellen, ſhe took no trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to oppoſe it, and contented herſelf with pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſying that it would all end ill.</p>
                     <p>Ellen, from the ſimplicity of her life, and the full occupation of her time, had perhaps thought leſs of love and matrimony than any girl of her age: but Henry was not the leſs dear to her for this. It is true, he made neither her ſleeping or her waking dreams. She ſlept each night ſound <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d undiſturbed: and ſhe aroſe each morning gay
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:036127_0050_10084F884C442EB8"/>
and active. The day was not more tedious when Henry was away; but it was infinitely more de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful when he was there. His converſation had more charms for her than that of any other of her companions, but ſhe had no deſire to enjoy his converſation apart. If things went on in their uſual courſe, Henry occurred ſeldom to her mind: but if ſhe were more than ordinarily pleaſed, or more than ordinarily chagrined, "Oh, that my couſin were here!" was the firſt wiſh of her heart: Ellen heard the commendations of Henry with no ſenſation but that of a ſimple acquieſcence in their truth. But where he was blamed, ſhe was ſtruck with ſurpriſe, and thought not ſo much of vindicating him, as correcting a miſtake. Of his merits, as equivocal, ſhe herſelf never ſpoke, no more than of the light of the ſun: they appeared equally uncontrovertible. Neither thought ſhe of denying or affirming that ſhe loved him. To love Henry ſeemed to her as natural as loving herſelf. But had he never been allowed to return to Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland, when he left it on his laſt viſit to his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, however Ellen might have ſenſibly lamented the loſs of her earlieſt friend and moſt loved com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panion, her peace would have remained ſecure, and her heart unwounded.</p>
                     <p>Henry had hitherto been ſatisfied with the kind of love Ellen had felt for him. But he now ſought to render it more decided and appropriate.</p>
                     <p>The change in his attentions had not before eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped her: and the change in his language was ſtill more ſtriking. This change did not, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, diſpleaſe her; nor did it alarm her, till ſhe began to find ſomething like it in herſelf. Ellen had been accuſtomed to think, nor could ſhe proceed long heedleſsly in any path. Little re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:036127_0051_1008386D75466D80"/>
upon circumſtances made her believe, that it was her duty to repreſs the too fervent ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions and intimations of Henry's regard, and to lead herſelf and him back to that calm ſtate of friendſhip, when, however delighted to be toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they were indifferent whether it were with others or alone.</p>
                     <p>In conſequence of this little plan, ſhe avoided all tete-a-tete walks, all withdrawings from ſoci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to purſue their ſtudies or amuſements toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. Sometimes ſhe aſſumed an air of reſerve, when his heart was running over at his lips; and at others appeared not to underſtand what was ſpoken in the moſt expreſs terms.</p>
                     <p>Henry was in deſpair; for he did not find out that all theſe were ſymptoms the moſt decided in his favour.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt amuſed himſelf ſometimes with thoſe cares. As he had no objection to the hook ſtriking deep into the heart of Ellen, he ſuffered her thus to play with the line 'till ſhe was completely entangled in it.</p>
                     <p>Having heard her one day reſolutely deaf to the earneſt ſolicitation of Henry for a walk in the wood, and having ſeen him in conſequence walk off in a huff, while ſhe remained thoughtful and ſilent at her work,</p>
                     <p>"How comes this, Ellen?" ſaid he, "It ſeems as if Henry and you were not upon ſuch good terms as formerly."</p>
                     <p>Ellen bluſhed.</p>
                     <p>"Or are you upon better?" ſaid mr. Mordaunt archly. Ellen bluſhed a deeper die: and almoſt hiding her face in her handkerchief, ſhe replied
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:036127_0052_10084E5FF5209218"/>
faintly, "It might be poſſible I might ſee too much of my couſin."</p>
                     <p>"And do you think if there were danger that you might ſee <hi>too</hi> much of your couſin, I ſhould have ſuffered you to have ſeen <hi>ſo</hi> much?"</p>
                     <p>Ellen raiſed her eyes haſtily to her father; and as haſtily let them fall again.</p>
                     <p>"Come, my dear Ellen, if I were your lover, I might perhaps enjoy your confuſion: but as your father I muſt relieve you from it. You may follow Henry into the wood; and whatever he may ſay to you there, be aſſured he has mine and his father's ſanction for."</p>
                     <p>The inexpreſſible joy that filled the heart of Ellen at theſe words, firſt told her how much ſuch a ſanction was neceſſary to her happineſs.</p>
                     <p>Whether Ellen followed Henry into the wood, or whether ſhe waited for the explanation, till he followed her there, may be left to the deciſion of every female who reads their ſtory. But certain it is, that from this evening he had an allowed intereſt in her heart.</p>
                     <p>Like him, ſhe had a perfect reliance on his conſtancy, and his induſtry. But he did not ſo fully agree with her, that their happineſs was likely to be more permanent from being eſtabliſhed on the grounds of prudence and forbearance, than if they were, maugre all ſuch conſiderations, to begin it from that moment.</p>
                     <p>It mattered not, however, as to the effect, what was the opinion of either of them in this point. From the decree which had declared their marriage ſhould not take place till Henry's application pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him five hundred pounds a year, there lay no appeal.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="55" facs="unknown:036127_0053_10084E619D5B3E58"/>Henry took chambers in Lincoln's Inn, and began his legal career with equal diligence and acuteneſs. Every vacation he ſpent at Groby Manor: and he was earneſt in diſplaying, both to Ellen and her father, his habits of application and economy. Ellen relying upon his affection, and pleaſed with her proſpects in life, had no jealouſies to alarm, or anxieties to diſturb her. She purſued, uninterruptedly, her accuſtomed courſe of ſtudies and amuſements: and as ſhe grew more her own miſtreſs, and more independent, they were im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved into pleaſures of the pureſt kind, by being enabled to render her benevolence more active, and by ſuffering her attentions to take a wider range.</p>
                     <p>She had now nearly attained her nineteenth year; and ſhe had reſided wholly at Groby Manor for the laſt twelve months. She continued, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, to live much with mr. and mrs. Thornton, under whoſe dearly-beloved roof many hours of every day were paſſed. Nor could any thing in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe that affection which ſubſiſted between her, and its highly-valued inhabitants. The gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of taſte, and the feelings of the heart, formed the ties which bound them to each other: and the force of obligation, received and communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated, rendered them indiſſoluble.</p>

                     <p>IT was at this time that lord Villars invited his ſiſter and her whole family to his houſe in Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire. He had formed for his eldeſt ſon a ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trimonial connection, with lady Almeria Weſtern, an heireſs of a large fortune, to whom he was guardian. To bring this matter to the deſired iſſue, had coſt him much artifice and trouble: and the ſucceſs of his plans filled him with not leſs pride than pleaſure. The lady was ſtill very young: and as his ſon had no attractions either of perſon or manner, he was eager to complete the marriage before her comparative powers would lead her to make ſuch diſtinctions as might probably break it off for ever. As ſhe added a very competent ſhare of beauty to the attractions of her thouſands, it was not to be doubted, but that, if ſhe appeared in the world, mr. Villars would meet with many competitors: and lord Villars had none of that blind parental partiality that could conceal from him, in any degree, the
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:036127_0055_10084E6CCBFCA638"/>
danger of ſuch a competition. The marriage, it was therefore determined, ſhould take place im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately. It was to be celebrated in the country; and lord Villars wiſhed, by making every circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance relative to it as ſplendid and dazzling as poſſible, to perſuade the young bride that ſhe was an enviable and a happy woman.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt willingly accepted the invitation, both as an indulgence to his wife and his elder daughters, and from a deſire to introduce Ellen to a more intimate knowledge than any ſhe had yet attained, of a family of which ſhe was ſome time to make one. Henry alſo was to leave the duſt and dullneſs of his chambers, upon this feſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive occaſion: nor was there to be any one circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance omitted that could contribute to the ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction of any of the individuals who were to form the party to be aſſembled. Joy and happineſs were to pervade the whole.—But how vain are the plans of human wiſdom! The triteneſs of the obſervation is the proof of its truth.</p>
                     <p>Three days before the intended nuptials, the deſtined bridegroom was thrown from his horſe; and received a hurt, that in thrice as many hours deprived him of life.</p>
                     <p>It would be impoſſible to deſcribe the degrees and variety of ſorrow this event gave occaſion for. Lady Villars wept as a tender mother. Her children were affected in a greater or leſs degree, according to their age and ſenſibility. Lady Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria was more ſtunned than afflicted. Mrs. Mordaunt ſaw, with grief, the path that this event opened to the exaltation of Ellen. Henry's un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feigned ſorrow for the death of his brother was not unmixed with a tumultuous ſenſation, ariſing
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:036127_0056_10084E7028088CE8"/>
from the change that had thereby ariſen in his own ſituation, and the uncertainty how that change might operate on the deareſt wiſhes of his heart.</p>
                     <p>Theſe various emotions, however, were all within the bounds of moderation: but, to the grief and diſappointment of lord Villars there were no bounds. The ſorrows of a parent on the death of a child appeared to be ſacred and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionable; all hearts of common humanity ſympathized with lord Villars: but few, if any, ſuſpected the ſource from whence the extremity of his affliction proceeded.—He had loſt his ſon: this loſs might be ſupplied. But with his ſon he had loſt the heireſs—that heireſs, by the fortunes of whom every branch of his family were to be benefited, on whoſe property he had formed, in idea, a ſuperſtructure of greatneſs and power, which could be realized by no other means, and the demolition of which filled him with the crueleſt pangs. There was indeed one way; but it was nearly hopeleſs.</p>
                     <p>On Henry had devolved the rights and the titles of his brother, could he be prevailed upon to fulfil his engagements. Lord Villars had often wiſhed him in his brother's place. The ſupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riority of his character fitted him for the head of his family: but the decrees of nature could not be reverſed: and lord Villars had endeavoured to perſuade himſelf, that wealth and rank might beſtow, even upon his eldeſt ſon, the conſequence that character had denied. They might how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever now be united—they muſt—they <hi>ſhould</hi> be united. Lord Villars had taken his reſolution<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it remained only to think of the means that might put it into force.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="59" facs="unknown:036127_0057_10084E732C023858"/>The firſt ſtep was to break Henry's engagement with Ellen. But it was an act of ſo violent and irritating a nature as to make almoſt hopeleſs every conſequence that lord Villars wiſhed to follow from it. It was, however, a neceſſary ſtep, and that without which nothing could be done. Lord Villars well knew the tender feelings of Henry: and though he was aware he ſhould in vain at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to overcome his ſpirit, he was not without hopes that he might work upon his heart.</p>
                     <p>For this purpoſe, the genuine ſorrow that the firſt ſenſe of his diſappointment inflicted, was ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in lord Villars by a counterfeit affliction, in appearance as deep, as heart-breaking, and as incapable of conſolation as was ever felt by a parent for the loſs of an only and highly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved offspring.</p>
                     <p>Henry ſoon loſt every other thought in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſeration for his father, and in anxious endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to conſole him. But lord Villars was not to be conſoled. He could no longer endure to remain at a place, where he had been deprived of the hopes of his future life. He wiſhed to remove to a ſmaller houſe that he had on the borders of the county: and he wiſhed only to have for his companions lady Villars, lady Almeria, mrs. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt, and Henry. Of lady Almeria indeed he had become ſo fond, that he could not bear her from his ſight. "She was the beloved of his loſt ſon: how could ſhe be otherwiſe than inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly dear to him?"</p>
                     <p>For the deſire of retaining mrs. Mordaunt he gave more genuine reaſons. He knew there were no ſchemes for the aggrandizement of her <hi>own</hi> family, (as ſhe always took care to denominate that of the Villars's) and for the mortification of
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:036127_0058_10084E7628C96FD0"/>
Ellen, that ſhe would not with equal avidity ſeek to promote. He therefore ſaid, with the moſt perfect ſincerity, "that from her company he hoped more, than from any other, toward ſoothing his mind:" and he earneſtly intreated mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt to leave her with him for a few weeks, promiſing, at the end of that period, to bring her himſelf into Northumberland, where, with mr. Mordaunt's permiſſion, he would ſtay ſome time, as he hoped from the quiet and ſecluſion in which he might there live, to regain more compoſure and happineſs, than he could expect to derive from more buſy and public ſcenes."</p>
                     <p>It was not poſſible for mr. Mordaunt to refuſe his conſent to any part of what lord Villars pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed. But in ſpite of his wiſh to repel all ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion from his mind, there was ſomething in lord Villars's conduct that excited very uneaſy ſenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, as to the rectitude of his future intentions.</p>
                     <p>Without his being able to fix on any one cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance that could juſtify his fears, mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt was ſtrongly poſſeſſed by the apprehenſion, that lord Villars's grief was a cover to deſigns inimical to the happineſs of Henry and Ellen. There appeared too much plan and arrangement in all he did, to proceed from a mind wholly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merſed in grief, as he pretended his to be. The extravagant attachment that he profeſſed to lady Almeria, the almoſt total neglect that he mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted to Ellen, with the perfect ſilence he main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained as to the engagements ſubſiſting between her and Henry, and the excluding her from a party where ſhe would ſo properly have made one, all contributed to ſtrengthen this apprehenſion.</p>
                     <p>Lady Villars, who had become extremely fond of Ellen, had expreſſed a wiſh that ſhe might
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:036127_0059_10084E79937B5DA0"/>
continue with her: but this had been mentioned only once, and ſeemed to be no more thought of. Henry, who had not ſuppoſed it poſſible it ſhould be intended ſhe ſhould leave him, expreſſed the utmoſt aſtoniſhment and reluctance when he found it was ſo deſigned: and he was told by mrs. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt, that it was at the particular requeſt of mr. Mordaunt that Ellen was to go away.</p>
                     <p>All theſe circumſtances conſpired to oppreſs mr. Mordaunt's mind with very ſerious fears. But he was withheld by delicacy and reſpect to the ſorrow lord Villars diſplayed, from coming to any explanation upon the ſubject with him at this time. He knew the delay of a few weeks could be of no importance; and he was willing to hope, that by giving lord Villars more time for reflection, he might be led to ſee the injuſtice of any haſty deſign, which the poignancy of his preſent diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment might have ſuggeſted, of ſeparating Henry and Ellen. He was alſo cautious not to betray any ſuſpicion that might ſeem to ſuggeſt the poſſibility of ſuch a meaſure being adopted, and ſtill more ſo to avoid giving a ſanction to ſuch breach of faith, by ſeeming to expect it. He contented himſelf therefore with ſaying to lord Villars, that he ſhould be truly glad to afford him every conſolation that he could derive from the retirement of Groby Manor, and the unwearied attentions of his family to every thing likely to contribute to his ſatisfaction; and that Ellen, he was aſſured, would think it as much her pleaſure as her duty to do all in her power to ſupply the loſs he had ſuſtained.</p>
                     <p>"We will talk farther of ſuch things," ſaid lord Villars haſtily, "when I rejoin you in Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland:
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:036127_0060_10084E82057988F8"/>
and it ſhall not be long before I ſhall do ſo."</p>
                     <p>Divided between hope and fear, as to what were lord Villars's future plans, mr. Mordaunt returned, with his daughters, to Groby Manor. But to Ellen he communicated neither the one nor the other: and happily for the eaſe of her mind, no ſuſpicion ſimilar to her father's, had found admittance there. Since the death of mr. Villars, ſhe had been wholly occupied with the feelings of others; and all thoughts of ſelf had been loſt in her ſolicitude to adminiſter to the comfort of thoſe around her. The change that had taken place in the ſituation of Henry had been brought about by ſo diſaſtrous an event, that it never preſented itſelf to her mind under the form of pleaſure: but neither did it ever occur to her that a circumſtance that ſecured him an immediate ſituation in life, more affluent than that which he was to have attained by the flow progreſs of his perſonal efforts, could be the means of placing a barrier between them, who were ſo certainly to have been united when thoſe efforts were crowned with ſucceſs.</p>
                     <p>She returned, however, ſaddened by the ſcenes ſhe had witneſſed, by her ſeparation from Henry, and by ſomething of an unſettled notion, that though lady Villars was all kindneſs and affection, towards her, lord Villars had ſhewn her more marks of neglect than regard.</p>

                     <p>LORD VILLARS and his family were now removed to the Grove; and Henry appeared ſo aſſidious in his efforts to adminiſter comfort to his father, and ſo ſincerely touched with the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of his grief, that lord Villars was led to believe he might ſafely begin his operations.</p>
                     <p>One day, therefore, as they were alone toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, lord Villars, as uſual, apparently immerſed in ſorrow, and Henry, as uſual, exerting all his faculties to rouſe and amuſe him. "My dear fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther," ſaid he, with emotion, "it goes to my heart to ſee you thus overcome with a fruitleſs affliction. For my ſake, for the ſake of your fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, endeavour to recover more power of mind."</p>
                     <p>"I am indeed overcome with affliction. But it is for the ſake of my family that I am thus over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelmed."</p>
                     <p>"My dear ſir, we all know your paternal feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. We all know the loſs that—"</p>
                     <p>"No, Henry, it is not <hi>that:</hi> it is not any ſelfiſh ſorrow that overwhelms me. I could bear my own loſs: but it is the ruin of my family, involved in that loſs, which I deplore."</p>
                     <p>Henry ſtarted. Thoughts ruſhed into his mind, which if they had ever found entrance there be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore

                        </gap>ed, as too affrontive to the ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of his father, to be entertained for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>"The eldeſt ſon of a noble and not opulent family," continued lord Villars, "ſtands in ſo many relative ſituations, that his death, when his place cannot be fully ſupplied by a ſucceeding brother, is no ſingle misfortune. It inflicts no ſingle wound. Every branch of that family, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever widely diverged, muſt ſuſtain an incurable evil."—</p>
                     <p>Henry was ſilent. He felt no inclination in himſelf to take his brother's place—to heal theſe wounds. Lord Villars went on.</p>
                     <p>"You know the princely fortunes that lady Almeria was to have brought to your brother: but you are miſtaken if you ſuppoſe the advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages would all have been his. You, your bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, your ſiſters, the whole innumerable tribe of you, would have felt the beneficial effects of her property through your lives, and perhaps be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the lateſt period of them."</p>
                     <p>"My brother's death," ſaid Henry coolly, "was very unfortunate both in its circumſtances and effects."</p>
                     <p>"In its circumſtances it certainly was. But it depends upon you to ſay whether it ſhall be ſo in its effects."</p>
                     <p>"Upon me, my lord," ſaid Henry, affecting more ſurpriſe than he felt.</p>
                     <p>"My dear ſon, I have no reaſon to doubt the rectitude of your principles, or the tenderneſs of your heart. I can therefore have no doubt how you will act. But it is painful to me, that your duty and inclination ſhould be, however little, divided."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="65" facs="unknown:036127_0063_10084E8CADE94BC0"/>"Divided, my lord! no, thank heaven, they are united, and united in ſuch bonds as no power whatever can diſſolve."</p>
                     <p>"How you charm me, my deareſt ſon! and how true it is that a wiſe ſon maketh a glad father!"</p>
                     <p>Lord Villars was not accuſtomed to quote ſcripture. Henry's heart was not the lighter for his doing ſo upon this occaſion.</p>
                     <p>"It is neceſſary, my lord, that we ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand each other. I preſume, that we both mean, that it is my duty to maintain engagements entered into voluntarily, and authoriſed by your ſanction?"</p>
                     <p>"Undoubtedly, all ſuch engagements as <hi>can</hi> be kept. But when a change of circumſtances has changed not only the nature of duties, but of poſſibilities, engagements that cannot be fulfilled diſſolve themſelves. I am aſſured that your own natural ſenſe tells you that you cannot <hi>now</hi> marry Ellen."</p>
                     <p>"Not marry Ellen! What power ſhall hinder me."</p>
                     <p>"The power of your own mind, ſir—the ſenſe of right—the dread of my never-ceaſing abhorrence."</p>
                     <p>Henry writhed with agony.</p>
                     <p>"It is to your underſtanding, it is to your juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice I appeal. Where is now that independence on which alone you grounded your right to chooſe for yourſelf? Is it your own intereſt, or the inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of others, that in purſuing that choice you would ſacrifice? Had you, from the firſt, been placed in the circumſtances you are now in, ſhould you have dared to propoſe ſuch a choice to me?
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:036127_0064_10084E8F93C6F530"/>
Do you believe me ſufficiently weak, or wicked, to have ſanctioned ſuch a choice? You are no longer the perſon you were when I did ſanction it. You have no longer the ſame rights, the ſame duties. You muſt no longer have the ſame conduct."</p>
                     <p>"Let me then," ſaid Henry, with a new-born hope ſpringing up in his ſoul, and brightening his eye, "let me then reſume that ſtation, where only can my happineſs and my duty be reconciled. Let me again become a younger brother. To Frederic, with all my heart and ſoul, will I make over all my rights of primogenitureſhip."</p>
                     <p>"It is not in your power, ſir. You cannot give him your title, unworthy as you are to retain it."</p>
                     <p>"And what is title without honour? You require me to give up the one, and yet are tena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious of the other."</p>
                     <p>"I am jealous of both alike, ſir; and will not ſee either proſtituted to the romantic fancy of a boy."</p>
                     <p>"You wrong my affection, my lord; indeed you wrong it. It is founded on reaſon and on virtue."</p>
                     <p>"I ſhould be leſs ſurpriſed at the warmth with which you purſue it," returned lord Villars, with a ſarcaſtic ſmile, "if it were founded upon beauty. Your paſſion, Henry, wants the ſtamp that will alone make it paſs current in the world."</p>
                     <p>"Beauty! Ellen is an angel."</p>
                     <p>"Yet this angel of yours will have no objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to becoming your wife, though ſhe bring you for her dowry <hi>ruin</hi> and a father's deteſtation."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! no, no, ſhe would reject, ſhe would renounce me for ever, rather—"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="67" facs="unknown:036127_0065_10084E93F6852F10"/>"And can you admire that rectitude of mind in her, which you refuſe to imitate? But I talk not of your ruin, ſir. After the degeneracy of mind that you have betrayed in this converſation, were you alone concerned, I would not trouble myſelf to with-hold you from it. But <hi>I</hi> muſt not ſo far forget <hi>my</hi> duties, whatever <hi>you</hi> do <hi>yours,</hi> as to ſuffer you to involve in your deſtruction the deſtruction of a family. My hopes for the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of you all, were placed on your brother's match with lady Almeria. You have ſucceeded to your brother's rights, and to his engagements: and, however unworthy of it, you have alſo ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded to his place in lady Almeria's heart. She views you, ungrateful boy as you are, with but too favourable an eye. Upon you it depends to give wealth and happineſs, or poverty and wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, to your parents and to your family. We ſhall ſee the kind of heart you have, by the elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion you make."</p>
                     <p>"The happineſs that derives wholly from wealth, and the wretchedneſs that is dependent alone upon poverty, are both, in my eyes too unſubſtantial to deſerve any ſacrifices—my lord, do with me as you will—but I will <hi>never</hi> be the huſband of lady Almeria."</p>
                     <p>"And remember, peremptory ſir, that but under my heavieſt malediction ſhall you ever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come the huſband of Ellen."</p>
                     <p>The father and ſon here parted: and from this day the farce of affliction, except in public, was over.</p>

                     <p>BUT if the boſom of lord Villars ſeemed light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened from a load of woe, that of Henry became inſupportably oppreſſed.</p>
                     <p>However he might be rouſed by the thought of ill treatment to a reſolute aſſertion of his own rights, or however firmly his heart might be at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to Ellen, or his determination be unchange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably fixed, never to abandon her, he could not be unmoved by the diſpleaſure of his father, or by the thought, that in a parent's eye he was the cauſe of unhappineſs to himſelf, or family. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could he be inſenſible of the truth of many of lord Villars's arguments, or unconſcious that a marriage with Ellen, in the preſent circumſtances, would be attended with many inconveniencies. But the thought that dwelt moſt upon his mind, and the grief that preſſed the heavieſt upon his heart, aroſe from the probability that now this marriage would never take place. He believed he knew her too well to flatter himſelf that ſhe would become his wife againſt the expreſs prohi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition of his father: and perhaps he prized her integrity too highly to wiſh that ſhe ſhould do ſo. But the ſenſe of this integrity, the certainty of the virtues from which it aroſe, made the ſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:036127_0067_10084E9D2A636CD8"/>
that he ſhould never call her his, an agony that he knew not how to endure. He diſtracted himſelf with endeavouring to find out ſome middle way, that might reconcile his father's expectations and his own ideas of happineſs: but, wherever he turned, his deteſted title, like Dejanira's fatal gift, ſtuck cloſe, and filled him with torment and deſpair.</p>
                     <p>His father often returned to the attack, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times with an appeal to his generoſity and his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon; and then was his reſolution moſt in danger of yielding, and his heart torn with the extremeſt anguiſh: ſometimes with the high tone of autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and the moſt ſevere denunciations of ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting diſpleaſure. Here Henry was invulnerable. When he was threatened, he became as the rock, which ſeems but the more firmly fixed by the ſtorm that beats againſt it.</p>
                     <p>He knew, however, that if he did not yield, neither would his father; and that in any caſe his happineſs, and in the former both his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and filial duty muſt go to wreck. Of lady Almeria he thought little. Yet it was ſome ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition to his unhappineſs, to ſee evident marks of that partiality, with which his father had told him ſhe diſtinguiſhed him.</p>
                     <p>This was in part the work of mrs. Mordaunt; and it was the buſineſs in which lord Villars had from the firſt engaged her.</p>
                     <p>Lady Almeria, even before the death of mr. Villars, had not been wholly inſenſible to the difference which nature had made between the brothers. She had not been entirely without ſome wandering thoughts, that if Henry had been the elder brother, her deſtiny would have been the
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:036127_0068_10084E9EF626EE28"/>
happier. But ſhe was too young and too giddy to ſuffer thoſe thoughts to ſink deep in her mind, had it not been for the artifices and management of mrs. Mordaunt, who inſinuated how generous it would be in lady Mary to turn her affections to Henry. She formed the hope, that he might re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn thoſe affections: and it was by her ſkill and care, that the ſtrength of his engagements with Ellen were concealed from lady Almeria. All thoſe were, however, unneceſſary cares, and founded wholly upon the imperfect knowledge that had yet been attained of the diſpoſition of lady Mary.</p>
                     <p>Scarcely eſcaped from the nurſery, ſhe was little known; and ſhe had credit given her for infinitely more feeling and delicacy than ſhe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed. Of love ſhe was incapable: but having quick perceptions, and a tolerable power of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>criminating characters, ſhe was well formed for taking ſtrong though tranſient likings. And while ſuch prepoſſeſſions laſted, it would not have been any conſideration, for the peace or honour of another, that would have with-held her from the gratification of them. Stimulated by the arts of mrs. Mordaunt, and moved by her own taſte, ſhe had taken this kind of fancy to Henry; and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided ſhe could inſpire him with the like, ſhe troubled her head little with the nature of thoſe engagements that had once ſubſiſted between him and Ellen. It was not in Henry's nature to be rude or careleſs, eſpecially where a woman, and a young and pretty woman, was concerned. His addreſs, therefore, to lady Almeria, was gentle and obliging: and though ſhe would rather it had been impaſſioned or gay, yet ſhe hoped both theſe modes were to come, when he had got over
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:036127_0069_10084EA334F46580"/>
the odd fancy, as ſhe called it, of grieving for the death of a brother, which had made him heir to a title and an eſtate of ſeven thouſand pounds a year.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, Henry, alike unable wholly to explain his diſtreſs, or wholly to conceal it from Ellen, wrote her letters that filled her with the cruelleſt diſquietude. She knew not how to ſhape her fears; but every added line told her that ſome misfortune awaited her. Whether ſhe were to ſuffer with or apart from Henry ſhe knew not. Whether ſhe were to be the ſport of his incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, or the victim of his prudence, ſhe was unable, from the tenor of his letters, to reſolve. Had ſhe been to have choſen her fate, the deciſion was eaſy. The reſignation of Henry ſhe thought herſelf equal to: but under his depravity or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs ſhe believed ſhe muſt ſink.</p>
                     <p>In this ſtate of her mind, ſhe was as little able to expreſs her wiſhes and her fears with clearneſs, as was Henry himſelf. She called upon him again and again, to explain himſelf; while he, ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, thinking he ſaw a flexibility in his father that revived his hope, and ſometimes, from his increaſed ſeverity, relapſing into deſpair, alter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately awakened the hopes and the fears of Ellen, without explaining to her his grounds for either.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt ſaw the uneaſineſs of Ellen, and but too truly divined the cauſe. He forebore, however, to preſs her upon the ſubject, and thought ſhe would frankly have opened her heart to him, ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſhe had any thing certain to tell. She ſhrunk from converſing with him on a myſtery that might involve the condemnation of Henry.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt wrote repeatedly both to lord Villars and mrs. Mordaunt, to remind them of
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:036127_0070_10084EA810B90950"/>
their promiſe, of joining him in Northumberland, but hitherto without receiving any ſatisfactory anſwers. Lord Villars, however, beginning now to be convinced he had nothing to hope either from the ambition, the reaſon, or the obedience of Henry, reſolved to try his influence with Ellen, and by making her renounce his ſon, render it a matter of indifference, as far as their engagements, whether his ſon would renounce her or no. He determined therefore to ſet out for Northumber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land. He wiſhed to conceal his intention from his ſon: but Henry had too much at ſtake, to be eaſily thrown off his guard, or lulled into a falſe ſecurity.</p>
                     <p>He had conſidered, that while his father con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in Hampſhire, the conteſt lay wholly be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them; and that there was at leaſt a chance, that his obſtinacy might out-tire that of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's. While this was poſſible, he forebore to explain himſelf to Ellen, unwilling to impreſs her mind with the painful ſenſe of his father's injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice, or to make a parade of his own conſtancy: but he was aware, that lord Villars's removal into Northumberland was with the deſign of bringing the diſpute before another tribunal, and a tribunal where he knew the voice of love would plead in vain, were it once imagined to be oppoſed by that of reaſon or of rectitude.</p>
                     <p>Not a moment, therefore, was to be loſt, leſt Ellen might be intereſted in the deciſion, by an undue application to her generoſity, or by a belief, though but a momentary one, that he could heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in his. He was therefore no ſooner convinced that lord Villars meant to begin his journey to Northumberland in a few days, than he diſpatched a meſſenger with the following letter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

                     <p>THIS letter was received by Ellen with a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of emotions. She read in it a certainty of her misfortune; but ſhe read in it alſo an aſſurance of the conſtancy and generoſity of Henry.— She acknowledged no right that could divide her from him; but ſhe trembled at the power, that, in adhering to him, ſhe knew ſhe muſt oppoſe. —Her heart told her, there was no happineſs without Henry: and the ſource of rectitude ſhewed her, that there was no eſcape from miſery in becoming his wife, under the prohibition of a parent.</p>
                     <p>She had now no reaſon for any reſerve to her father. She ſhewed him Henry's letter, which, however, told him nothing but what his pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration had before diſcovered.</p>
                     <p>"Is it poſſible," ſaid he, "that lord Villars can be thus cruel and unjuſt!"</p>
                     <p>"If he deſign to appeal to me," ſaid Ellen, "he muſt mean to abide by my deciſion."</p>
                     <p>"And your deciſion, my Ellen.—What would be your deciſion?"</p>
                     <p>"Alas! I know not. It is no broad path that
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:036127_0074_10084EB3B4B3E9B0"/>
lies before me: Intricate and ſcarcely to be made out by ſuch a one as I, is the line of duty, that, if I could be ſure of, I hope I ſhould purſue."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt preſſed Ellen to his heart.</p>
                     <p>"Henry pleads his rights ſtrongly, they are indubitable, they cannot be cancelled by the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>date of ambition or avarice, though iſſued by a parent. But to be the author of his ruin, and his filial diſobedience! Oh! my father, ſuch deci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions are beyond my reaſoning faculties, they muſt be decided by the impulſe of my heart, not, I hope, more firmly attached to Henry, than to virtue."</p>
                     <p>"Excellent creature!" ſaid mr. Mordaunt: and Ellen felt herſelf encouraged by the praiſe.</p>
                     <p>"It may be generous and right, that Henry ſhould refuſe to abandon me. It may be virtuous and neceſſary that I ſhould reſign him."</p>
                     <p>Thus did poor Ellen endeavour to balance the reaſons that made for and againſt her wiſhes. But ſhe bewildered her underſtanding without relieving her heart.</p>
                     <p>"I will ſee lord Villars. I will hear, (dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous as it may be) I will hear Henry. If I muſt loſe him, he ſhall not be torn from me: I will give him up. Oh! my father, if the ſacrifice muſt be made, allow me to make it."</p>
                     <p>"No other can make it. I abjure lord Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars's ſophiſtry. Having once authoriſed your engagements with Henry, I cannot recal my ſanction. You are miſtreſs of your fate. I am willing to aſſiſt your judgment: but I muſt not control your will."</p>
                     <p>"My will?" ſaid Ellen, ſighing, "alas! how little muſt that be conſulted in this debate."</p>
                     <p>Ellen paſſed three days in what might be called a labyrinth of thought, rather than a chain of rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning.
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:036127_0075_10084EB542BB3FD0"/>
When, from what ſhe regarded as an evident principle of duty, "the ſtrict adherence to her engagements," ſhe had drawn concluſions the moſt favourable to her happineſs, her deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were croſſed by a principle as evident, as that of the obedience of children to their parents, and all her reaſoning thrown into confuſion. Again ſhe began; and again ſhe found herſelf conducted to a certain point; and, again con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed and bewildered, ſhe found ſhe had loſt her way.</p>
                     <p>From ſuch a maze of contrary obligations, ſhe knew not how to extricate herſelf. Yet ſhe loſt not hope, while ſhe perceived that which ever way ſhe turned, wherever ſhe directed her view, <hi>the wiſh to do right</hi> ſtill appeared, as a beacon on a diſtant hill, pointing out the coaſt to which ſhe meant to direct her courſe.</p>
                     <p>It was impoſſible, except where the mind was wholly given up to ſelfiſhneſs, or reſentment, to live with Ellen without loving her. The evenneſs of her temper, her promptitude in obliging, muſt ſubdue all leſſer prejudices. This had been the caſe with her ſiſters; though their early eſtrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment from her, and the difference that ſubſiſted in their manner of thinking, forbade any of that tender intereſt and interchangement of ſentiments in which true friendſhip conſiſts; they now loved her full as well as moſt reputed friends love each other: and now that pity was added to their affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, they felt and ſhewed for her a ſolicitude, that neither they nor herſelf had before thought them capable of.</p>
                     <p>Charlotte, in particular, was much moved by the evident diſtreſs of Ellen's mind, and the calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:036127_0076_10084EB7DAC4DC08"/>
with which ſhe endured it. She thought there was ſomething heroic in ſuch compoſure, under ſuch circumſtances; and ſhe exerted all her abilities to conſole and ſupport her. But, however Ellen was ſoothed by her ſympathy, ſhe could not be aſſiſted by her counſel. Charlotte could ſee the matter only in one light. She ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patiated on the injuſtice of lord Villars, on the merit of conſtancy, and the obligation of main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining an engagement: and when Ellen preſſed her with the queſtion, "Would you, Charlotte, be the wife of any man, who, in forming his ties with you, muſt break all thoſe that bind him to his family, and incur the everlaſting reſentment of his parent?" Charlotte could only reply, lord Villars had no right to be diſpleaſed; and that the peace of Henry ought to be dearer to her than that of all his family beſide.</p>
                     <p>"But the peace of Henry," ſaid Ellen, "is involved in the religious performance of his duty as a ſon."</p>
                     <p>"No," Charlotte would reply, "ſuch conduct as lord Villars holds, diſſolves the bonds of filial duty. You ought to ſet him at defiance, and be happy in the love of each other."</p>
                     <p>Ellen would have been glad to have thought ſo too: but in a mind as free from the prejudices of ſelfiſhneſs as her's was, things are not ſeen as they are wiſhed to be, but as they are.</p>
                     <p>On the evening of the third day, Charlotte and Ellen were walking in the wood, wholly engroſſed with this one ſubject, when, as they were return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the houſe, they were ſuddenly met by Henry.</p>
                     <p>"We are once more together, my Ellen," cried he, ſnatching her to his heart: "and no power on earth ſhall part us."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="79" facs="unknown:036127_0077_10084EBAD92ACB78"/>Ellen, who had been engaged rather in debating whether ſhe ſhould chooſe misfortune, than in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploring it as already felt, had, ſince the receipt of Henry's laſt letter, been more depreſſed, than agitated. But his ſudden appearance, and the vehemence of his addreſs, communicated in a moment to her boſom all the emotion with which his own was convulſed. Sinking from his arms, rather than being able to try to diſengage herſelf from them, "We are indeed together," ſaid ſhe: "but, alas! upon what terms?"</p>
                     <p>"Upon terms that heaven and earth muſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove—Upon terms that give me a right to ſay I will never reſign you."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! be leſs vehement!" cried ſhe, and reſting wholly upon Charlotte, her convulſive ſobs gave Henry the moſt lively alarm. Never had he ſeen diſtreſs in this form. Never had he before ſeen the countenance of Ellen disfigured by the violence of any paſſion.</p>
                     <p>"Why not reſt in my arms? Why not weep in my boſom?" cried he mildly, "am not I your huſband? Oh Ellen, is it poſſible you can have decided againſt me?"</p>
                     <p>"No! no! no!" ſaid ſhe. Charlotte unable to ſupport her, yielded her to the impaſſioned Henry, who, holding her in his arms, ſat down with her on the graſs. Tears relieved the almoſt burſting heart of Ellen. She ſuffered them for ſome time to flow as ſhe hid her face on Henry's ſhoulder: then rouſing herſelf, "I am better," ſaid ſhe; "let us return to the houſe: and, my dear Henry, if you would have me able to act as you wiſh, you muſt not thus diſtreſs me."</p>
                     <p>"Deareſt Ellen, forgive me. I will be all calmneſs, all reaſon."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="80" facs="unknown:036127_0078_10084EBDC3375958"/>Ellen with difficulty moved along: but growing every moment more compoſed, the emotion that the ſudden appearance of Henry had given her, taught her the more to fear the power of her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, and to arm herſelf with double reſolution againſt being governed by them.</p>
                     <p>As they approached the houſe, they were met haſtily by mr. Mordaunt.</p>
                     <p>"Do you know who is arrived?" ſaid he.</p>
                     <p>"My father," cried Henry: "how nearly has he eluded my vigilance!"</p>
                     <p>Now, ſaid Ellen to herſelf, is the moment of trial come. Lord Villars appeared. Henry ſaw the pallid cheek of Ellen and the whiteneſs of her lips.</p>
                     <p>"My Ellen," cried he, "do not deſert your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; do not deſert me."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, heaven direct me," ſaid Ellen.</p>
                     <p>"Heaven does direct you. Heaven dictates what you ought to do. Heaven cannot approve of violated vows."</p>
                     <p>"Nor of diſobedience!" ſaid lord Villars ſternly.</p>
                     <p>"Forbear," ſaid Ellen to Henry, ("my lord.")</p>
                     <p>"Forgive my interruption, madam. To you I mean no harſhneſs. To the rectitude of your mind I know I may appeal, from the ungoverned paſſion of that intemperate young man."</p>
                     <p>"Temperance were treachery in this caſe. My lord, I ſee your deſign. You mean to tamper with the virtues of Ellen. You mean to ſubdue her conſtancy by her generoſity—but—"</p>
                     <p>"I am above diſguiſe, ſir. I do mean to prove the virtue you have ſo vaunted. It is you who have ſaid, that Ellen would renounce you for ever, rather than accept you at the price of your diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>obedience."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="unknown:036127_0079_10084EC130296FF0"/>"Heavens and earth!" exclaimed Henry.</p>
                     <p>"And moſt truly have you ſaid, my Henry," interrupted Ellen; "and moſt ſincerely do I thank you for it."</p>
                     <p>"I never ſaid ſo; or, if I did—Oh! Ellen, do not undo both yourſelf and me."</p>
                     <p>"My lord," ſaid mr. Mordaunt, "you are too precipitate. Ellen ought not to be, ſhe <hi>ſhall</hi> not be ſo perſecuted. You have nothing to fear, nothing that you ought to fear from her cooleſt deliberation; and it is only the cooleſt delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that ought to decide in ſuch a caſe as this."</p>
                     <p>And yet, thought Ellen to herſelf, the deciſion is made. What but <hi>one</hi> thing can I do?</p>
                     <p>"I meant not to be thus precipitate. I meant not now to enter upon the ſubject: but the daring impatience of that unworthy boy— My dear madam," turning to Ellen, "I know and revere your virtues. It is from them I hope the ſalvation of my family. Pray take my arm: let me ſupport you."</p>
                     <p>"My lord, I want no ſupport."</p>
                     <p>"Yes, my Ellen, you do. You want the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of a parent," ſaid mr. Mordaunt: "take my arm."</p>
                     <p>"Thank you, ſir," ſaid Ellen faintly, and almoſt overcome: and reſting on her father's arm, ſhe reached the houſe.</p>
                     <p>Here ſhe found mrs. Mordaunt, who greeted her with her uſual coldneſs: but ſeeing her agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation ſaid: "Yes, yes, I knew it would come to this. I always foretold this. I always ſaid that the intereſts of a whole family were not to be ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crificed to the fooliſh fancy of a boy and girl, who knew not what was good for them."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="unknown:036127_0080_10084EC5271D3AB8"/>"Dear mamma!" ſaid Charlotte.</p>
                     <p>"No harm, ma'am," ſaid Ellen mildly, "ſhall happen to any body, through my means, if I can prevent it."</p>
                     <p>"Retire, my dear," ſaid mr. Mordaunt. "I am ſure you wiſh to be in your own room."</p>
                     <p>Ellen moved towards the door. But Henry, who had hitherto kept a gloomy ſilence, now ruſhed forward, "You do not go, Ellen, you do not go, without ſuffering me to ſpeak to you, without hearing what I have to ſay?"</p>
                     <p>"She knows you have nothing to ſay," interrupted lord Villars, "that ſhe ought to hear. Ellen is indeed the excellent perſon you have always deſcribed her, the exemplar of her ſex."</p>
                     <p>"Henry has a right to be heard, my lord; and I mean to hear him. Nor have I more inclination than I have power to refuſe him."</p>
                     <p>"My kind, my beloved Ellen!"</p>
                     <p>Ellen held out her hand to him, "Oh!" ſaid ſhe, in a low voice, "that I could be as much the one as I believe I am the other!" Then ſpeaking aloud, "At eight to-morrow morning I will ſee you alone: at preſent I beg I may be allowed to retire."</p>
                     <p>Lord Villars who believed he ſaw the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his hopes in the ſeverity of her air towards him, and her kind indulgence to his ſon, ſtood thunderſtruck and confounded; while the wretched Henry, who argued the contrary but too juſtly, even from her very kindneſs, ſunk ſpiritleſs into a chair, while the warm blood forſook his cheek, and every limb quivered with agitation. Lord Villars endeavoured by a long detail of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of his family, to convince mr. Mordaunt's
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:036127_0081_10084EC6B3C5FB88"/>
reaſon of the neceſſity of the conduct he held, and by artful praiſes of Ellen to ſooth the indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity offered to her.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt diſdained to reply to his rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonings, or to thank him for his commendations. He aſſured him, that it was neither the wiſh of his daughter, or himſelf, that ſhe ſhould enter into his family without his approbation.</p>
                     <p>"But, my lord," ſaid he, "you have in my opinion, by your former ſanction to the affections of your ſon, put it out of your power now to with-hold your conſent to his marriage. All you have a right to do, is to endeavour to convince both him and my daughter, of the inconvenience that now attends it, and to induce them, if poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, by the weight of your reaſons, to reſign rights, which nothing but the moſt apparent in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice can with-hold."</p>
                     <p>Lord Villars was ſtung to the quick by the cold contempt of mr. Mordaunt.</p>
                     <p>"I am then to undo my whole family for a punctilio? Mine was only a conditional conſent. It <hi>could</hi> only be a conditional conſent. It was my <hi>ſecond</hi> ſon that I would have allowed to have mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried your daughter. No one would have dared to have aſked me for my firſt."</p>
                     <p>"Nor do I aſk you now, my lord. But if you have made a bad bargain, common honeſty re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires you ſhould ſtand to it, except thoſe with whom you have made it, will generouſly releaſe you."</p>
                     <p>"Would you then," ſaid mrs. Mordaunt (paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionately) "would you have an ancient and noble family fall into ruin, rather than thwart the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentary fancy of a fooliſh girl and an obſtinate boy? Rather be all the engagements that have
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:036127_0082_10084EC941151980"/>
been made ſince the days of Adam broken, than that ſuch a conſequence ſhould be incurred."</p>
                     <p>"Ellen would bring ruin into no family. I have, however, ſaid, that I think ſhe and Henry are the only proper umpires in this diſpute: and I could wiſh a ſubject to be dropped, upon which if I ſpeak at all, I muſt ſpeak very harſh truths."</p>
                     <p>"I would endeavour," ſaid lord Villars, with an air as if he were to be a ſufferer for conſcience ſake, "I would endeavour to get over the ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of my mind, in allowing one unworthy child to take his own way to ruin, which it ſeems with ſome people would much exalt my character. But when the intereſts of my other dear and innocent children are involved in his folly, however my name may be branded, I will adhere to what I know to be right: and though I may be unable to prevent this act of madneſs, I will never have to reproach myſelf with having conſented to it."</p>
                     <p>"Your lordſhip may reſt perfectly at eaſe both as to your conſcience, and the part Ellen will take. However either ſhe or myſelf may wiſh her the wife of your ſon, we can have no deſire that ſhe ſhould become your daughter."</p>
                     <p>"I ſee, however," ſaid lord Villars in a paſſion, "I ſee that ſhe deſigns it; but at her peril let her purſue the deſign. Poverty while I live, and my eternal curſe when I come to die, ſhall ſadden her days and torment her mind."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt aroſe, "I leave you, my lord: and I would leave you under the miſtake that ſo unworthily afflicts you: but when you find your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf maſter of your wiſhes, you ſhall not have cauſe to think that you owe the completion of them either to the duplicity or the vehemence of your conduct. I know Ellen perfectly well; and I
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:036127_0083_10084ECAF71DD148"/>
will ſtake my life, that in the preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances ſhe will <hi>never</hi> marry your ſon."</p>
                     <p>Lord Villars, on an aſſurance ſo agreeable to him, felt all his anger ſubſide in a moment. He did not wiſh to quarrel with mr. Mordaunt; ſo, catching his hand, he cried, "My dear brother, forgive me; forgive the effuſions of a father's ſolicitude for a large family, whoſe well being in the world depends upon the iſſue of the preſent conteſt. How willingly would I make any ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fice ſhort of the intereſt of this family, for the happineſs of being ſtill more cloſely united with you!"</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt withdrew his hand.</p>
                     <p>"You will give me leave to retire, my lord. It is not poſſible to form any judgment but one on the events that have paſſed: and the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of that judgment muſt be, that all inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe between us henceforward muſt ceaſe."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt withdrew; and left lord Villars and his ſiſter to rail and to rejoice; for after what mr. Mordaunt had ſaid, they neither of them entertained any apprehenſion but that Ellen would break her engagement with Henry.</p>

                     <p>HENRY had not been preſent at the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that had paſſed between his father and mr. Mordaunt. As ſoon as he had recovered from the emotion into which the laſt words of Ellen had thrown him, he had withdrawn to the parſonage, there to pour out his griefs to the commiſerating mr. and mrs. Thornton. They, while they en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavoured, by the ſofteſt arts of pity, to adminiſter ſome balm to his wounds, ſought to inſpire him with fortitude to ſupport the conſummation of his misfortune, which, in the preſent circumſtances they conſidered as inevitable.</p>
                     <p>Ellen paſſed the night in endeavouring to ſtrengthen herſelf in the reſolution, which ſhe ſaw was the only one ſhe could now adopt with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out incurring the reproaches of her own heart, and involving Henry in diſobedience and ruin. But ſhe dreaded his vehemence: and though ſhe per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded herſelf, that <hi>that</hi> alone would not be able to overpower her judgment, grounded, as it was, upon the beſt reaſoning ſhe was able to command;
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:036127_0085_10084ED36D86EC28"/>
yet ſhe ſhrunk from the conteſt: and had ſhe not had more compaſſion for him than for herſelf, ſhe would have explained herſelf in writing, and ſpared them both the pangs of a fruitleſs alterca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. But to comply with his wiſhes in every thing that militated not againſt his duty, ſhe thought the moſt ſacred of her own: and ſhe kept the appointment made the preceding night.</p>
                     <p>The moment ſhe caſt her eyes upon him, ſhe ſaw, that the trial that awaited her was of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent kind from the one for which ſhe had been preparing herſelf. All animation was fled from his countenance. A ſettled deſpair had taken poſſeſſion of his features: and as he approached her, the tears fell in large drops from his eyes.</p>
                     <p>"Dear Henry!" ſaid ſhe, holding out her hand to him. He took it; and preſſed it cloſely to his lips.</p>
                     <p>"So kind, and yet ſo determined! I do not complain, Ellen. But ſurely I ought not to have been condemned unheard."</p>
                     <p>"Unheard! am I not here for the purpoſe of liſtening to all you have to ſay?"</p>
                     <p>"Yet my father tells me, I have nothing to hope."</p>
                     <p>"Do not believe lord Villars rather than me. —You have every thing to hope that, in your unprejudiced reaſon, you would wiſh to hope. I think I may venture to promiſe you ſhall decide for me."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! that I might! then ſhould I never quit this dear hand till you had promiſed to pledge your faith with it at the altar."</p>
                     <p>"Would you then brave your father's diſplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? Would you be content to live in perpetual

                        </gap> and poverty on your family?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh! no, no.—My father would with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw his objections. Juſtice, reaſon, would com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel him to withdraw them. My family ſhall never receive injury from me. I have offered to diveſt myſelf of my birthright, to reſume the ſtation which Ellen's love might be allowed to bleſs. I have been told I cannot diveſt myſelf of my title, and that that title muſt be ſupported by riches; that the fortune I may obtain by marriage, muſt be ſuch as will provide for my numerous brothers and ſiſters, whoſe neceſſary proviſion will other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe reduce the family eſtate below the decorous appendage of a title. I am reminded, that ſuch have ever been the known family views; and that I acknowledged the force of them, when I pleaded my being a ſecond ſon, as an unanſwerable reaſon why I might be allowed to chooſe for myſelf. However my heart or my underſtanding may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volt from ſuch reaſonings, I mean not to combat them; I mean to act, as if convinced of their truth, and their rectitude: and had I not had reaſon to believe the cauſe already prejudged, I had a propoſal to have made to you, that, I perſuaded myſelf, might have reconciled duty and inclina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, have ſatisfied my father, and made us hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py."</p>
                     <p>Ellen's heart fluttered with revived hope.</p>
                     <p>"And what is your propoſal? Be aſſured there is no prejudgment. Only ſhew me how I can be yours, without violating the immutable obligation of obedience to a parent, and you will not be more ready to propoſe, than I ſhall be to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply."</p>

                     <p>"And did you? Could you?"</p>
                     <p>"You are calumniated, my Ellen. I have been taught to fear, that, awed by my father's threats of everlaſting diſpleaſure, you ſhrunk from a marriage, which, under that diſpleaſure, would be a ſource only of poverty and diſtreſs to you."</p>
                     <p>"How am I beſet on all ſides! How allured by inclination, how ſtimulated by reſentment to quit the rugged path of duty. Support my rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, my dear Henry, by your own: and make me no propoſal that is not warranted by the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of virtue.</p>
                     <p>"What I propoſe is this: that I ſhall purſue the line of life marked out for me before the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunate death of my brother; that the annual difference there will be between the allowance my father will make me as an inmate of Lincoln's-Inn, and that which I ought to have as his eldeſt ſon, ſhall accumulate, and be conſidered as a fund upon which I ſhall draw for your fortune; that I ſhall not claim your hand but upon the condition that it was firſt promiſed me. While my father lives, the ſplendor of the family will be ſupported by him. When he dies, though it muſt ſuffer a temporary eclipſe, it will be in no danger of being annihilated.—No wonder," ſaid Henry, interrupt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:036127_0088_10084EDB5CECC130"/>
himſelf, "that you ſmile. I almoſt diſdain to dwell upon ſuch conſiderations. But if there is no preaching people into reaſon, it is well, for the ſake of peace, to accommodate ourſelves as well as we can to their folly. As I have no hope, that the ſavings I have propoſed to be made from my annual allowance will be conſidered as ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factory to the wants and the wiſhes of the family, I further propoſe, that in the event of my coming to the eſtate, ſuch a part of it ſhall be appropriated to the uſe of my brothers and ſiſters, as, in ſome given number of years, may make up the ſum that my father has fixed in his own mind as a proper fortune to be brought into the family by his eldeſt ſon's wife. At the end of this time, I ſhall reſume the whole of the eſtate, and the name of Villars recover its luſtre. Thus no injury will be done to the younger branches of the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily; you, my Ellen, will, after all, be a for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune: the family ſplendor will be untarniſhed: and all this will be purchaſed on our part, by a few years of obſcurity and happineſs."</p>
                     <p>Though Ellen had a rectitude of principle and underſtanding, that made her perfectly compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend, and reſolutely adhere to that plaineſt of nature's dictates, the obedience due to a parent, ſhe was too young and too noble-hearted to cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culate the inconveniences of a narrow income, or to have ſuffered them to have influenced her deciſion, if ſhe had calculated them, while they could reach only herſelf and him, who, ſhe doubted not, would have conſidered the poſſeſſion of her hand as a full compenſation. Her heart beat quick at this propoſal of Henry's. Her eyes ſparkled with pleaſure. "And what ſays your

father to this plan?" cried ſhe, trembling with the eagerneſs of hope.</p>
                     <p>"What ſays he! What can he ſay? Has he any right to object?"</p>
                     <p>"But <hi>does</hi> he object?" ſaid Ellen, with a voice ſcarcely articulate.</p>
                     <p>"Deareſt Ellen, will you hazard nothing for me? When every claim of juſtice is ſatisfied, are we to be undone for a punctilio?"</p>
                     <p>"Your father does <hi>not</hi> then approve your plan?"</p>
                     <p>"But he will approve it. He will be com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to approve it. All the world will unite in his condemnation, if he does not."</p>
                     <p>"When he <hi>does</hi> approve, be aſſured of my moſt cheerful, my moſt delighted concurrence."</p>
                     <p>"And without that approbation, you will do nothing for me?"</p>
                     <p>"Alas! what <hi>can</hi> I do? Had it been only juſtice that was to have been ſatisfied, ſhould we ever have been in any danger of being ſeparated? Will this plan of yours at all avert your father's diſpleaſure? Will it ſave you from diſobedience, or from the effects of it? Will you not have a parent's enmity to deprecate? And without the concurrence of lord Villars how can your plan itſelf take place? How can its beneficial effects be felt? How can the claims of juſtice, which you ſeem yourſelf to allow, be ſatisfied?"</p>
                     <p>"Time will do all for us. My father will forgive, when he ſees that the conſequences he ſo dreads, have not followed the ſtep he forbids. We ſhall have injured no one, and be happy in each other.—"</p>
                     <p>"Oh! Henry, Henry! how ſhould we be happy? There can be no happineſs for a child

in diſobedience to a parent. No ſophiſtry, no hope of ſelfiſh joy can obſcure ſo evident a truth, can allure me to dare its violation. We have no choice; if lord Villars perſiſts in his oppoſition, we muſt ſubmit, and —"</p>
                     <p>Part—ſhe would have ſaid; but her tongue faltered, and ſhe ſtopt.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! Ellen, you have not the heart to utter the word, and can you perſiſt in the act?"</p>
                     <p>"Cruel neceſſity forces it upon us. We can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not do otherwiſe."</p>
                     <p>"Well then be it ſo," ſaid he, after a pauſe: "but let not the parting be for ever. Let us yield in appearance to the preſent ſtorm. Let us preſerve our hearts for each other, and refer our happineſs to a time when no imagined duty, no real injuſtice can ſtep in between us."</p>
                     <p>"Dear Henry, do not ſo tempt me. See you not the fallacy of this? See you not, that we ſhould live on falſehood; and that the hypocriſy that affects the air of a difficult virtue, is, in it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, the worſt vice?"</p>
                     <p>"All your concluſions, Ellen, tend to one point. Would you then have me make obedience perfect? Do you adviſe me to marry lady Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria?"</p>
                     <p>"I am but a bad caſuiſt," replied the weeping but unrelenting Ellen: "but I do not ſee that the duty which requires you to give up your own choice to the will of your father, exacts that you ſhould adopt his in oppoſition to your own."</p>
                     <p>"What then does he gain by the obedience you ſo unfeelingly enforce?"</p>
                     <p>"At preſent the ſatisfaction that muſt reſult to a parent from even the partial compliance of a child with his wiſhes; and, in future, the more

                     <p>"Let us not," ſaid Ellen, trembling, "let us not deceive ourſelves. It is with this hope the preſent ſacrifice is required. Our renunciation of each other muſt be complete—it muſt be for <hi>ever.</hi>"</p>
                     <p>"For <hi>ever</hi> be it then," ſaid Henry, ruſhing towards the door, "for now I ſee that you deſire it."</p>
                     <p>"Stay, dear Henry."</p>
                     <p>"Dear! do you ſay I am dear?"</p>
                     <p>"<hi>Moſt</hi> dear! do not inflict upon me the only trial to which I feel myſelf unequal. I can bear to give you up: but I cannot bear that you ſhould believe me fickle or intereſted."</p>
                     <p>"Oh would to God, I could believe you ſo. But while I think of you as you are, how ſhall I imitate you in the virtue that ſo exalts you in my eyes?"</p>
                     <p>"It is from ſad neceſſity that I act. You too muſt feel its irreſiſtible power: and all the merit that either of us can have, is in the manner in which we ſupport that neceſſity."</p>
                     <p>"I do not yet admit the neceſſity. If you refuſe to reſign the rights you have over me, my father muſt yield to them."</p>
                     <p>"Let us not go over the ſame ground," ſaid the almoſt exhauſted Ellen. "Nothing but lord Villars's conſent to our marriage will ever juſtify me to myſelf in becoming your wife, or you in my eyes for accepting me as ſuch. Lord Villars has declared, and who can doubt his firmneſs, that his conſent never ſhall be obtained. The

conſequence is obvious. Dear Henry, receive my laſt farewel!"</p>
                     <p>"Never, never will I give you up—I will never relinquiſh you,—nay, you muſt not, ſhall not leave me."</p>

                     <p>"Go then: but be aſſured I ſhall haunt you wherever you go. My father ſhall gain nothing but my miſery by his injuſtice. If I cannot be your's, I will not be another's."</p>
                     <p>"You will think better of it," ſaid Ellen, as ſhe opened the door; "farewel." She cloſed it; and, her taſk over, her powers forſook her, and ſhe ſunk into a chair motionleſs, and nearly with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out recollection. There was nobody to obſerve her: and ſhe had time to return to herſelf. Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly ſhe heard a movement in the room ſhe had quitted. She aroſe haſtily, and paſſing up a pair of back ſtairs, took refuge in her own chamber.</p>
                     <p>Henry, given up to his emotions, had remained where Ellen had left him. The ſudden entrance of lord Villars rouſed him from his grief. He ſtarted at the ſight of him, as at ſomething nox<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious; and paſſing furiouſly by him, quitted the houſe on the inſtant.</p>
                     <p>Lord Villars required no other proof of the part Ellen had taken; and exulting in the ſucceſs of his ſchemes, ſent a reſpectful meſſage to her, deſiring he might have the honour of returning his thanks in perſon. This was, however, a mark of complaiſance that Ellen thought ſhe might well be allowed to refuſe him. She therefore excuſed herſelf by writing theſe words on a ſcrap of paper.</p>
                     <p>"As lord Villars will learn from his ſon the ſubmiſſion that has been paid to his will, there is
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:036127_0093_10084EE97648D5D8"/>
no doubt but he will willingly excuſe himſelf the ſight of a perſon whoſe preſence muſt be a reproach to him. Ellen therefore begs leave to decline the honour of appearing before him."</p>
                     <p>Lord Villars, even in the midſt of his triumph, could not help feeling the ſuperiority both of mr. Mordaunt and Ellen: and he withdrew from Groby Manor ſucceſsful it is true, but mortified; and his pride ſeverely hurt, that though he had overcome by the force of his power, he had not been able to deceive by his duplicity.</p>

                     <p>HENRY had found ſhelter at the parſonage; and it required all mr. Thornton's influence to bring his mind to any degree of moderation. Diſpleaſed yet enraptured with Ellen—indignant againſt his father, yet feeling the principle of filial love and filial duty ſtrong in his heart—his paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were wrought up to a pitch of intemperance that allowed his reaſon no weight, and urged him to reſolutions that could only perpetuate and juſtify his miſery. Mr. Thornton at length ſucceeded in calming him: but he could not prevail with him to relinquiſh the idea of endeavouring to extort from Ellen a promiſe that ſhe would preſerve her heart for him, and wait in the hope that he might by ſome means induce his father to withdraw his objections. Mr. Thornton in vain repreſented that he had no reaſon to doubt Ellen's joyful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſcence in any meaſure that tended to unite them, and which had lord Villars's ſanction; nor had he any thing to fear from the lightneſs of her mind, or the variableneſs of her inclination. But to ſeek any conceſſion on her part at this time, and much more any promiſe, would be to make
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:036127_0095_10084EF01D2C4300"/>
all the reſolution ſhe had hitherto ſhewn, appear as a mean ſubterfuge; and would, in fact, in its effect, entirely deſtroy what ſhe moſt intended to eſtabliſh, his obedience to his father.</p>
                     <p>Henry felt as if there were ſtill ſomething to be done, and it was intolerable to him, to ſit down in inactive hopeleſſneſs. It was ſome relief to him to ſeek Ellen in the wood, though ſure not to find her there. He acknowledged every evening, that the purſuit was vain, yet went out every morning with revived expectation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> He wrote and his letter was returned. But again he wrote; becauſe to write was to do ſomething; and while he made the effort, he for ſo many minutes ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended deſpair.</p>
                     <p>Ellen, not a whit leſs afflicted, though more patient than Henry, had indulged herſelf in one day's ſecluſion from her family. The happineſs ſhe had given up, was too dear to her heart, not to demand from her a ſincere tribute of grief to its memory. And indeed the agitation that her mind had undergone for the laſt twenty-four hours, made it neceſſary that in private ſhe ſhould calm and regulate her feelings. She ſaw, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, her father; and found in his careſſes and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation the beſt reward for what ſhe had done, and her beſt ſtimulative to perſeverance.</p>
                     <p>On the morrow ſhe appeared again in the breakfaſt room; reſumed her accuſtomed em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments; and endeavoured, by ſomething like cheerfulneſs, to do her part toward diſpelling the gloom which ſeemed to have ſettled over Groby Manor. By this conduct ſhe rendered innoxious the unkindneſs of her mother. All her taunts and ſarcaſms rather lacerated her own than Ellen's heart; while Ellen appeared unconſcious of her
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:036127_0096_10084EF302099F28"/>
deſign to hurt her. She forbore to reproach others; and felt ſhe could herſelf he no juſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of reproach to any one. With the thoughts of the future ſhe did not diſturb herſelf. Perhaps ſhe believed that the image of Henry would never depart from her mind: but ſhe neither told her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf that it would be ſo, or encouraged the idea when it occurred. Having reſolutely entered the path of duty, ſhe was reſolved to tread it, lead where it would: and if, in the preſent depreſſed ſtate of her mind, ſhe formed a wiſh, it was to hear that Henry was equally reaſonable with herſelf.</p>
                     <p>But however this temper of mind was the cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain road to happineſs in time to come, for the preſent ſhe was more than ſufficiently wretched to have gratified the wiſh of the moſt malignant. It was not poſſible to obliterate with a wiſh all remembrances of paſt delight, or promiſed felicity. It was not poſſible to forget, that Henry had been alike the choice of her fancy and of her reaſon; that his love had been her beſt treaſure; and that in relinquiſhing it, ſhe made him as wretched as ſhe made herſelf. The thought indeed of his miſery was often more than ſhe could bear. The work was ſuſpended, and the book dropped from her hand, when her too faithful memory repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his tranſports and his deſpair. His idea was, in fact, ſo cloſely united with every thing ſhe did, or thought, with every object around her, and with every occupation ſhe attempted, that to forget him was impoſſible: and ſhe ſometimes doubted if ſhe ſhould ever be able to remember him with leſs anguiſh than at the preſent moment.</p>
                     <p>It is true, he gave her very little time for mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the experiment. He was every day at Groby
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:036127_0097_10084EF4B6A0BDC0"/>
Manor: and though ſhe conſtantly refuſed to ſee him, this did not make him forbear attempting to throw himſelf in her way, in all their formerly moſt frequented walks. He wrote to her conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nually. His letters were unſealed: but ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned them unread. Again he wrote to her, and he employed her ſiſters to inform her, that he could not believe ſhe did him the injuſtice to refuſe to look into his letters.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt frequently ſaw him; and as he was touched with the moſt ſincere compaſſion for his ſufferings, was willing to tolerate this unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonableneſs for ſome little time, hoping that ſuch indulgence would lead him to reſume more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand over himſelf. But, in the mean time, his heart bled for Ellen, on whom, in ſpite of her ſelf-command and fortitude, this perſecution had the moſt ſenſible effect.</p>
                     <p>At length, mr. Mordaunt found himſelf ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liged to tell the unfortunate Henry, that he could no longer ſuffer him to haunt the environs of Groby Manor; and that if he wiſhed to preſerve his friendſhip, he muſt quit Northumberland. Henry's ſpirit took this ill, and he declared that nothing but an order under Ellen's hand ſhould induce him to quit the country.</p>
                     <p>Ellen's heart bled for his diſtreſs. She forgot her own.</p>
                     <p>"I would ſee him once more," ſaid ſhe, "whatever it might coſt me; but in ſeeing him what relief ſhall I afford him? He knows my heart. He knows how I ſuffer with him. If we meet, we ſhall enfeeble each other."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt encouraged her to write to him. This was not an eaſy taſk. But ſhe hoped ſome good might ariſe from her letter; and ſhe reſolved
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:036127_0098_10084EF768A405B0"/>
to write. After many leſs ſucceſsful efforts, as ſhe thought, ſhe ſent him the following:</p>
                     <p>"It is a cruel perſecution that you ſubject me to, my dear couſin. Why do you force me to appear ſevere and unkind, when I aim only at being juſt and true? The relief that you require from me, I have it not in my power to grant. But in the example of obedience that I ſeek to ſet you, I offer you all the conſolation that our un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy circumſtances allow. Aſſure yourſelf I have not read your letters. How harſh it ſounds to ſay, that while affairs remain as they now are, I never will. This is the laſt of my writing that I can addreſs to you. Of all the power that once we might be ſuppoſed to have over each other, that which good will and friendſhip give, alone remains, if you would not have me believe that with you I have forfeited even <hi>this,</hi> you will en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to make that taſk <hi>eaſy,</hi> which I <hi>muſt</hi> per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form, however <hi>difficult.</hi> I entreat you to leave Northumberland: and if we are ever to meet again, let it be without ſelf-reproach on either ſide.</p>
                     <p>"Adieu! and every bleſſing be your's, that attends on virtue. If there were a happineſs apart from rectitude, ſuch is the honeſty of my affection, that I could not wiſh it you."</p>
                     <p>After all, this was a bad letter—but Ellen was not in circumſtances to write a good one. It was received by Henry with tears of delight and anguiſh. To ſee Ellen's hand-writing addreſſed to him, filled his mind with joy. But there were ſome touches in the letter, and more eſpecially the purport or the whole, that ſtung him almoſt to madneſs.—He obſerved, that ſhe no longer
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:036127_0099_10084EF93A4A1E80"/>
called him her dear Henry, but her dear couſin, as if the affection ſhe bore him was no longer ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>propriate to himſelf, but belonged only to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation he held towards her. The relinquiſhing for ever all power over him but what aroſe from friendſhip and good-will, ſhewed him, that ſhe did not wiſh to owe even his compliance with her requeſt, to any more ardent or particular feeling. Her earneſtneſs, that if ever they met again, they ſhould meet without ſelf-reproach, convinced him of her adherence to her principle, that their preſent ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration ought to be conſidered as the termination of their engagement, and that if they were again to meet, it muſt be only as friends. The intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that ſhe wiſhed him no happineſs indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent of rectitude, he thought pointed out a deſire, that he ſhould fully comply with his father's wiſhes. All theſe obſervations filled him with the moſt poignant grief, and the laſt (in which, however, he was miſtaken) with the moſt lively reſentment. Nothing, he now found, was to be hoped for, from a longer continuance in Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland: and he therefore determined to be gone.</p>
                     <p>He committed to mrs. Thornton a few lines, which, as he aſſured her they were his laſt fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel, ſhe did not ſcruple to receive, and to engage that Ellen ſhould read.—Thus he wrote:</p>
                     <p>"I go.—You requeſt it: and I comply. But it is not the cool principle of friendſhip that gives ſuch abſolute power over the mind. It is not a ſenſe of your <hi>good-will,</hi> that throws me a vagabond on the world, without an object, without a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive for action, and delivers me to all its dangers, robbed of the polar ſtar, hope, to direct my courſe. You have withdrawn your beneficial in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence:
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:036127_0100_1008509EA6D12240"/>
but it is not in your power to withdraw that which may impel me—perhaps to my ruin. They tell me you act nobly. It may be ſo; for you <hi>were</hi> all excellence. But my faculties are too much clouded to diſtinguiſh between right and wrong; and I can feel only your unkindneſs. Heaven ſhield <hi>you</hi> from ſelf-reproach, but for <hi>myſelf!</hi>—</p>
                     <p>"Adieu! adieu! my beloved, my <hi>own</hi> Ellen, appropriated to me by vows, by love!—No, I will not throw you back into the common herd of relations, you who have ſo long been worn near my inmoſt ſoul, the deareſt treaſure I poſſeſſed. —Adieu! and may you ſoon forget your couſin."</p>

                     <p>THIS letter was the ſevereſt ſtroke Ellen had received. Its incoherence, the deſpair it mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted, gave her an image of Henry's mind, that filled her with horror. It made her call in queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion the rectitude of all ſhe had done. She felt herſelf accountable for any exceſs that Henry might commit: and ſhe knew not, that ſhe was exculpated by <hi>any</hi> motive, from the guilt of having broken an engagement which had always acted like a charm upon Henry, and preſerved him hitherto in the paths of virtue and prudence. While ſhe believed herſelf right, whatever ſhe ſuffered in being ſo, ſhe retained a ſource of comfort in her own breaſt that calmed her moſt tumultuous paſſions, and lulled her loudeſt griefs. But the ſuppoſition, that ſhe was <hi>wrong,</hi> deſtroyed this calm, and gave her up to the moſt unmitigated affliction.</p>
                     <p>She was at one moment inclined to annul all ſhe had done; to declare her adherence to her engagements with Henry, and her deſign to wait till lord Villars either withdrew his objections, or was no longer able to enforce them. But the conviction that ſhe was influenced to ſuch deſigns, rather by the complainings of Henry, than by any reaſonings of her own, made her firſt heſitate as to the rectitude of ſuch a ſtep, and then abandon the idea altogether. Sometimes ſhe thought to
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:036127_0102_10084F93F0F3EFC8"/>
write to Henry, openly to acknowledge all ſhe ſuffered, and unequivocally to declare that her regards towards him were the ſame as ever. But ſhe conſidered that this was, in fact, to tell him only that, of which he could not doubt; and that as it could not be followed by any yielding of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution on her part, it would only ſerve to revive a hope that muſt again be loſt in ſtill bitterer diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointment. She conſidered further, that as ſhe had declared her renunciation of him to be final, whatever affection ſhe might in ſuch early days of their ſeparation ſtill be allowed to entertain for him, yet that it ought by every paſſing hour to become leſs and leſs; and that therefore ſhe was bound to avoid any profeſſions that might ſeem to promiſe a continuance of this love, or which might encourage him to keep alive in his breaſt a paſſion which ſhe had exhorted him to ſacrifice.</p>
                     <p>On the whole, ſhe was convinced that her ſtreng<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> was to fit ſtill; that ſhe had nothing far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to do, but to bear her own burden with all the patience ſhe could; and by obtruding herſelf as little as poſſible on the memory of Henry, to accelerate that period, when ſhe would be able to look back on the preſent painful tranſactions, as on the impreſſions made by a painful dream.</p>
                     <p>This was what the plain ſenſe and the true virtue of Ellen ſuggeſted to her, as the beſt line of conduct ſhe could purſue; and in purſuing it ſhe hoped in time to reap the reward ſhe ſo well deſerved, peace of mind to herſelf. But ſuch quiet forbearance, when exertion would have been ſo flattering to the feelings of her heart, was not without efforts ſo painful, that in the ſtruggle, the colour forſook her cheek; ſhe loſt her appetite and reſt; and, in ſpite of all her at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:036127_0103_10084F973B5D3078"/>
to the contrary, Ellen was but the ghoſt of what ſhe had once been.</p>
                     <p>In quitting Northumberland, Henry knew not where to go. To go to his father he felt was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible. He had no motive for returning to his chambers: and neither duty nor inclination called him elſewhere. He was indeed the very vagabond he had deſcribed himſelf to Ellen: and he felt careleſs as to what he did, or what became of him.</p>
                     <p>Lord Villars had carefully watched him from the time that he had himſelf quitted Groby Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor: and he was hence convinced that from the preſent ſtate of Henry's mind, nothing favourable to his future hopes was now to be attempted. He ſaw it was neceſſary to regain his influence over him by kindneſs; and to refer to ſome diſtant time the completion of thoſe views that he by no means gave up. He was, however, aware, that even tenderneſs from him at this time would be ſuſpected: and he therefore employed lady Villars to ſooth the paſſions of her ſon, and to ſoften his reſentment.</p>
                     <p>Lady Villars was a perſon of a good heart, but of very little underſtanding. She had always been accuſtomed to the moſt perfect ſubmiſſion to the will of her huſband. By him ſhe had been taught the impoſſibility of allowing their eldeſt ſon, to connect himſelf with a woman of no fortune, and the conſequent ruin of their family if he did ſo. This idea was by habit become ſo ſtrong, that ſhe could as eaſily have changed her nature, as have abandoned it. She therefore looked upon the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration of Ellen and Henry as unavoidable: but ſhe did not therefore look upon it with leſs pity<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                        <pb n="106" facs="unknown:036127_0104_10084F9BC0D24420"/>
and ſhe thought that every thing ought to be done, that could make their ſacrifice eaſy to them. That in time they would each be happy aſunder, ſhe had no doubt: but ſhe wiſhed time to be given them. Lord Villars from leſs kind motives, was of the ſame opinion. He engaged lady Villars to write to her ſon, aſſuring him of the tender concern that both ſhe and his father took in his happineſs, praiſing him for the compliance he had ſhewn to their wiſhes, and promiſing him that no other woman ſhould be offered to his accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, 'till the remembrance of paſt connexions was obliterated. From herſelf ſhe invited him to join her inſtantly at the park, from whence his father was abſent, expreſſing an anxious deſire to ſee him, and aſſuring him, he ſhould ſee nobody there that he did not wiſh to ſee. This conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion was meant to point to lady Almeria; and it was ſo underſtood by Henry.</p>
                     <p>On the receipt of this letter, he felt himſelf irreſiſtibly drawn towards his mother. Her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs he had always experienced: and it was peculiarly tempting at this inſtant, when he felt abandoned by the whole world. He hoped, too, from the facility of her underſtanding, to be able to perſuade her of the injuſtice there was in his giving up Ellen: and he knew, from the purity of her principles, that what ſhe believed to be unjuſt, ſhe would never think eligible.</p>
                     <p>He repaired, therefore, immediately to the park; and found, from the tenderneſs of lady Villars, all the conſolation that he had hoped. But he was diſappointed in his expectation of drawing her over to his ſide. Of the juſtice or injuſtice of the matter, ſhe declared herſelf incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petent to judge: but ſhe knew it was impoſſible
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:036127_0105_10084F9D484B36F8"/>
he ſhould marry a woman without fortune: and what it was impoſſible to avoid, however grievous, it was neceſſary to endure.</p>
                     <p>Thus, from the ſhortneſs of capacity in his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and the obdurate ambition of his father, Henry found he muſt give up all hopes of redreſs to his wrongs, or relief from his miſeries.</p>
                     <p>From this dreadful derelection of him ſelf, the policy, though not the kindneſs, of his father re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved him.</p>
                     <p>Lord Villars had conducted lady Almeria to an eſtate ſhe had in Devonſhire; and had left her under the care of an aunt, who was left joint guardian with himſelf. He had left her with an aſſurance, that a few months would obliterate all traces of Ellen from the breaſt of Henry; and that twelve months would not paſs before they ſaw the full completion of her wiſhes. He expected, by thus keeping up her hopes, that he could pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve her conſtancy; and that, though the period might be ſtretched much beyond that he predicted, ſhe would be in no haſte to form any other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexion. To leſſen the danger of her doing ſo, he recommended to her aunt, that ſhe ſhould paſs the coming winter in Devonſhire: and he engaged that lady Villars, himſelf, and ſon, ſhould viſit her there.</p>
                     <p>Having thus provided as much as circumſtances admitted, for the ſecurity of his prize, he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſely moved from place to place, avoiding the meeting with his ſon 'till he learnt from lady Villars, that, though he ſeemed to have ſunk into a deep melancholy, his reſentment appeared to have ſubſided; and that ſhe thought they might now meet with advantage to both ſides.</p>
                     <p>Lord Villars, on this intimation, went imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:036127_0106_10084F9ED0BFEB08"/>
to the park; and by the moſt winning addreſs, and the kindeſt manners, ſtrove to regain the confidence, and awaken the dormant affection of his ſon. He ſpoke to him of Ellen, and always in the moſt flattering terms; ſcarcely ſeemed leſs hurt than Henry, that ſo much merit ſhould be loſt to them; and deplored the neceſſity (upon the ſtrength of which he always took care to dwell) that ſeparated them: of any farther choice he gave no hint, ſaving that he ſometimes ſaid, that with the ſingle qualification of fortune provided for, the whole female ſex lay before him.</p>
                     <p>To the kindneſs of a parent, however ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, Henry could not be long inſenſible. He felt it as a balm to his wounds; and was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſo far ſeduced by it, as to hope that in time his father might relent. He wiſhed, therefore, for every reaſon, to preſerve the good underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing between them: and Ellen had ſoon the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation of hearing, that they appeared on the beſt terms together. The inference, indeed, that it was natural to draw from ſuch information, would not perhaps have been very conſoling to any mind leſs true and diſintereſted than Ellen's. But in having given up Henry to a ſenſe of duty, ſhe had made no reſervation whatever. She meant wholly and for ever to give him up: and in this circumſtance ſhe found no comfort ſo ſoothing to her heart, as to know that he began to recover his peace of mind, and to reſume the path of duty and obedience. It would lead him ultimately, ſhe doubted not, to marriage with ſome woman of his father's choice: and ſhe of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered up no other prayer, when this idea occurred, but that ſhe might alſo be ſo much the choice of Henry, as to ſecure his happineſs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="109" facs="unknown:036127_0107_10084FA1F35C3D38"/>It was not, indeed, before ſhe wanted it, that this comfort reached her. The impreſſion which his letter had made upon her feelings, ſhe had found it impoſſible to efface. Her mind was equal to any exertion: but her conſtitution ſunk under that which ſhe made to appear eaſy and cheerful, while her heart was torn by the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cruciating fears for the happineſs and good con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of Henry.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt ſaw, with extreme anxiety, her increaſing thinneſs, her loſs of colour, and a kind of feebleneſs that ſeemed creeping over all her faculties: and he felt, with ſomething like diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, that he thought he ſaw even Ellen unequal to the taſk of riſing ſuperior to an unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately placed paſſion. Ellen had felt, that there was ſo much to condemn in Henry's letter, that ſhe had carefully concealed its contents from every creature. Mr. Mordaunt knew not, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, the real ſpring from whence her bittereſt ſorrow flowed: and imputing her ſorrows wholly to diſappointed love, he ſaw, with ſurpriſe, an improvement take place both in her looks and ſpirits, from the moment ſhe knew Henry was living in his father's houſe, and that they were friends together.</p>
                     <p>He ventured diſtantly to try her on this ſubject, and to probe her feelings, to ſee how far ſhe could endure Henry's marriage with another. She underſtood him, and replied with the moſt perfect openneſs.</p>
                     <p>"My heart is lightened of its only intolerable weight, now I am aſſured that Henry is in the road of duty. All the ſorrows that belong to myſelf, I know I can bear, and, in time, ſubdue.
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:036127_0108_10084FA607A3B428"/>
I look for Henry's marriage! I acknowledge that my anxiety on the ſubject will be great: but when I releaſed him from his engagements with me, it was for the expreſs purpoſe of his forming new ones with another."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt could only claſp Ellen to his heart, and call her, what he thought her, the moſt rational of her ſex.</p>
                     <p>From this time, mr. Mordaunt ſaw a viſible improvement take place daily in Ellen. But to ſuppoſe that a perfect cure could be wrought while ſhe continued at Groby Manor, where every object reminded her of Henry, ſeemed as unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable as to expect that eaſe could be reſtored to a perſon while ſtill bound to the rack. Mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt felt that ſhe called for every aſſiſtance poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible for her to receive: and however inconvenient it might be, with regard to pecuniary conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, he determined, with his family, to ſpend part of the enſuing winter at Bath.</p>
                     <p>Ellen received the propoſal with the gratitude it called for. She knew, the reluctance that ſhe felt to quit Groby Manor, was an unfavourable ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom: and ſhe hoped change of place might indeed contribute towards making her more the perſon ſhe wiſhed to be, than ſhe felt ſhe was at preſent.</p>
                     <p>Lord Villars obſerved, that on the part of Henry there appeared nothing like a return to cheerfulneſs: and he began to ſuſpect, that ſo far from intending to get the better of his paſſion for Ellen, he ſecretly nouriſhed it, and that having reſolved to keep himſelf free from every other engagement, he looked forward to the time when his father's death would ſet him at liberty to follow his own inclination. The no-marriage of Henry was nearly as detrimental to lord Villars's
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:036127_0109_10084FA8EFB36D00"/>
family views, as his marriage with a woman of no fortune. And he dreaded ſeeing his ſon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed in ſentiments he knew it would be beyond any ſtretch of his power to overthrow. He had, indeed, gueſſed pretty nearly the ſtate of Henry's mind: ſomething, much reſembling the above plan, was forming itſelf ſtrongly into a reſolution, except that not daring to date his happineſs from his father's death, he had ſubſtituted in idea the vague term of ſome diſtant period, though well his reaſon aſſured him, that no period, however diſtant, during his father's life, could unite him, with his conſent, to Ellen.</p>
                     <p>Having in ſome meaſure fixed his own plan, the thought that moſt tormented him aroſe from the apprehenſion that Ellen might be induced to connect herſelf with another. It was this fear that had made him ſo ſtrenuous to draw from her a promiſe, that ſhe would preſerve her heart for him. Her refuſal had nearly diſtracted him: and the dread that her yielding might make all his conſtancy vain, ſtill continued to overwhelm his mind, with the deepeſt gloom.</p>
                     <p>Lord Villars knew that though by his power he had ſeparated Henry and Ellen, he could pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed no farther. To oblige Henry to take ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther wife, was what he could not do: and he now ſaw, that it was only from the change which time might make in the inclinations of Henry, that he could hope the complete ſucceſs of his deſigns. To keep him in the country, brooding over his diſappointment, and indulging in romantic plans of everlaſting conſtancy, was not the way to acce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerate this change. He therefore caught eagerly at a wiſh, ſlightly expreſſed by Henry, that he might be allowed to go for ſome time to his
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:036127_0110_10084FABF282F438"/>
chambers in town. To town therefore he went: and lord Villars employed every art to draw him from the gloom of Lincoln's-Inn to the haunts of gaiety and amuſement. He had the ſatisfaction to hear, that his ſchemes were not wholly unſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful.</p>
                     <p>After ſome time ſpent ſullenly alone, Henry began to regain his cheerfulneſs; to aſſociate with the young and diſſipated; and to be once again the delight of his companions. He now ſtood on a precipice, and, in the wreck of his love and happineſs, his principles and his virtue were well nigh involved.</p>
                     <p>But from the miſchiefs to which the mercenary views of a parent expoſed him, he was preſerved by his paſſion for a virtuous woman, from whom that parent wiſhed to ſever him for ever. The miſery of his mind, when alone, drove him into company; nor was it the ſtill voice of rational converſe, or the quiet complacence of domeſtic ſcenes, that could overcome the louder tone of grief, which ſpake within, or control the contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing paſſions that were boiling in his breaſt. Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion muſt be oppoſed to paſſion. The feſtive roar of laughter<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the diſſonant bray of Bacchus, were alone ſufficiently powerful to overcome the ſenſe he retained of his diſappointment; no wonder if in ſuch company, with a mind ſo diſordered, his

                     </p>
                     <p>Who does not tremble for Henry? One ſtep
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:036127_0111_10084FAE8798EA70"/>
beyond where now he ſtood, and he had fallen, not to riſe again but through the rugged paths of penitence and remorſe.</p>
                     <p>But the words in Ellen's letter, "if ever we meet again, let us meet free from ſelf reproach," had never departed from his memory. To meet again, to meet again as allowably dear to each other, as they had once been, was a hope ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwoven with his very exiſtence, that he felt, life and it muſt expire together. But to meet her unworthy of her, was a miſery beyond any he had yet known. To loſe her by his own fault, he knew would be diſtraction: and ſtarting from the idea with horror, he reſolved to quit a life where every moment teemed with temptations which he could not yield to without entailing on himſelf the ſevereſt ſelf reproach.</p>
                     <p>However reſolute he might be to avoid vice, he yet found that diſſipation of ſome kind was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to a mind, ſo cruelly thwarted in its fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite views as his was, and all its plans for the happineſs of every louring hour thus deranged.</p>
                     <p>He determined to ſeek this diſſipation abroad, where, even from amuſement, he might draw inſtruction, and where, while he diverted his melancholy, he might cultivate his under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</p>
                     <p>He applied to lord Villars for permiſſion to leave England; and received a ready compliance with his wiſhes. Lord Villars, however, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly deſired to ſee him firſt: and Henry haſtened down into Hampſhire. Lord Villars had art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully ſent off lady Villars into Devonſhire before his arrival: and, when Henry aſked for his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, he was told where ſhe was, and that ſhe
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:036127_0112_10084FB16D3D3510"/>
was ſo much indiſpoſed, that ſhe could not travel into Hampſhire to ſee him, and ſtill leſs could ſhe ſuffer him to quit England without bidding him adieu.</p>
                     <p>Henry ſaw the trap: but, firm in his own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, he did not fear any conſequence, that could be drawn from viſiting a ſick parent in lady Almeria's houſe. He therefore readily accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied his father into Devonſhire: and when there, he ſought, by a ſtudied coldneſs towards lady Almeria, to evince to every body, that it was only a parent that he did viſit.</p>
                     <p>Lady Almeria was, however, young and hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome: and ſhe ſhewed him ſo flattering a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, that Henry, who was no anchoret, found it impoſſible to maintain his reſerve.</p>
                     <p>Lady Almeria was a little giddy-brain, who either felt or cared for no conſequence, let her ſay or do what ſhe would. She laughed and romped with Henry; rallied his grave airs; talked of her own paſſion; boaſted the conſtancy with which ſhe would wait his return; and ſeemed ſo ſure of her paſſion being anſwered, that it was impoſſible to tell her ſhe was miſtaken. Henry was amuſed, and perhaps flattered by all this: but his heart was only the more immovably attached to Ellen; for who could thought of exchanging her for lady Almeria? His ſpirits received great improvement from his ſojourn in Levonſhire: but he quitted England without having wavered for a moment in his reſolution, of having no other wife but Ellen.</p>
                     <p>Lord Villars ſaw enough, during Henry's viſit into Devonſhire, to raiſe his hopes; but he alſo ſaw that while Ellen remained unmarried, they probably would never be fulfilled; her marriage,
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:036127_0113_10084FB634D7F440"/>
therefore, became a point with him, and he em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed his ſiſter to bring this about if poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Ellen ſoon learnt, from her mother, the viſit Henry had made in Devonſhire, and ſhe learnt it under all the exaggerated forms that malicious miſrepreſentation can give. In the pain that Ellen felt, at this information, ſhe acknowledged the little progreſs ſhe had made in driving Henry from her heart: but even here her pain was not wholly ſelfiſh; in the character of lady Almeria ſhe ſaw nothing that could make Henry happy: and again ſhe felt herſelf accountable for his loſs of happineſs, as ſhe had before done for his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable loſs of rectitude.</p>

                     <p>THE whole Mordaunt family had now been ſome months at Bath. Ellen had impoſed upon herſelf to partake of all the amuſements of the place: ſhe therefore refuſed no amuſement that was offered her. The mornings were ſpent at breakfaſts, and the evenings in balls. But a way of life, ſo little ſuited either to her preſent inclinations, or to her habits, exhauſted both her mind and body, and ſhe was often compelled, from wearineſs and indiſpoſition, to remain at home.</p>
                     <p>At home, indeed ſhe never failed of paſſing the hours extremely to her ſatisfaction. Her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther and ſiſters were conſtantly engaged, and her father as conſtantly at leiſure: but he was ſeldom alone: and his ſociety and that of his friends, was much more ſuited to Ellen's diſpoſition, than any, that, in the preſent ſtate of her heart and ſpirits, ſhe met with in public</p>
                     <p>Sir William Ackland was among the moſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant of her father's viſitors: and it ſoon became evident, that he was not the leſs ſo from his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing now, from her increaſed indiſpoſition, almoſt ſure to meet Ellen in her father's drawing-room.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="117" facs="unknown:036127_0115_10084FBBA69198A0"/>Sir William Ackland was one and forty: but he united to an uncommonly elegant and youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful looking perſon, the poliſhed manners of a man who had lived much in the world. He had paſſed many years of his life abroad, was a man of ſenſe and obſervation, and particularly excelled in the art of converſation. When ſilent there was ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing auſtere in his countenance and manner: but when he ſpoke, the gloom diſperſed, and he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared all gaiety and good humour. His fortune was ample: and it was underſtood among his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance, that he was reſolved to ſettle in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and marry.</p>
                     <p>It was apparent, from ſir William's firſt know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of Ellen, that he watched her attentively; but he ſeemed rather to ſtudy her character, than to be in love with her perſon. Ellen ſaw, in ſir William Ackland, nothing but an agreeable friend of her father's; his converſation pleaſed her, and unconſcious of his deſigns, and without any her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſhe converſed with him with a freedom and unreſerve which ſoon diſplayed the ſtores of her underſtanding and the goodneſs of her heart.</p>
                     <p>This freedom was not checked on the part of ſir William, by any attentions that could obtrude the idea of a lover upon her fancy. She ſaw him every day the ſame, polite, obliging, and friendly: but though Henry, Ellen's prototype of love, was all there, he was ſo much more, that it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible that Ellen ſhould believe effects ſo differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent ſhould ſpring from the ſame cauſe. It never once occured to her that ſir William ſought her for a wife: and had ſhe been conſulted on the ſubject, ſhe would have thought her eldeſt ſiſter more ſuited to the ſtation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="118" facs="unknown:036127_0116_10084FBD2F56D9C8"/>But this was not the opinion either of ſir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, or of mr. Mordaunt. The latter thought he ſaw, in an union with ſir William Ackland, an aſylum for Ellen from all the ill humour of her mother. In the opulence of ſir William's fortune, he believed, was ſecured to Ellen a never failing ſource of the indulgence of her benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he thought her ſituation, as his wife, would call into action all the powers of her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, and all the virtues of her heart. All the enquiries he could make into the character of ſir William were anſwered favourably: and though through his long abſence from England, he was not intimately known to any body, he was uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formly ſpoken of as a man of a liberal mind, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tegrity and virtuous diſpoſitions. It ſoon, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, became the favourite wiſh of mr. Mordaunt, to ſee Ellen united with ſir William Ackland: but as he was aware the more time elapſed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the propoſal was made, the more likely it was to ſucceed; all the efforts that he made, were rather to retard than to bring it on.</p>
                     <p>Ellen had, however, an open and profeſſed lover. He alſo was a baronet, a ſtout hale man of fifty, who, with a good conſtitution, and two thouſand pounds a year, declared he wanted no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing but a young wife, and an heir to his eſtate. Ellen laughed both at his wants and his wiſhes; nor did ſhe conceive it poſſible that any body ſhould treat his pretenſions more ſeriouſly.</p>
                     <p>But if mr. Mordaunt deſired ſir William Ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land for his ſon-in-law, mrs. Mordaunt had not leſs earneſtly fixed her mind upon ſir John Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clair. By marrying Ellen to him, ſhe would fulfil the taſk lord Villars had given her to performs and by giving ſuch a huſband to Ellen, ſhe would
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:036127_0117_10084FC016C98EA0"/>
gratify the never ceaſing diſlike ſhe entertained towards her. For a girl with fifteen hundred pounds to her fortune, to refuſe ſuch an eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment, appeared to her madneſs: and poor Ellen was obliged to be very ſerious in a matter that appeared highly ridiculous to her.</p>
                     <p>Her ſteady refuſal of ſuch honours drew upon her from her mother, ſo much reproach and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loquy, as made her life completely wretched. Sir William Ackland carefully obſerved all the family proceedings in this matter: and he was not more pleaſed to remark that pecuniary advantages alone would not diſpoſe of Ellen, than he was with the mildneſs with which ſhe endured all the ill treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment her oppoſition to her mother's unreaſonable deſires occaſioned her. He wiſhed, indeed, to ſee how ſhe would conduct herſelf to a younger lover; for there was ſomething in the ridicule with which, while the affair continued a laughing matter in the family, ſhe had treated the notion of ſir John Sinclair's thinking himſelf a ſuitable huſband for her, that had preſſed rather unplea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſantly upon ſome of ſir William's feelings; nor were his wiſhes long ungratified.</p>
                     <p>Among the numerous partners whom the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune of the dance had conſigned to Ellen, there was one young man, who, being juſt come to his eſtate, and maſter of himſelf, imagined that the firſt woman he liked to flirt with, was the one with whom he could be happy for life. He made love with the ſame eaſe he would have made tea; and received Ellen's refuſal with the ſame non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chalance, as he had made his propoſal. As he wanted neither ſenſe nor money, was handſome and full as well bred as moſt of the young men
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:036127_0118_10084FC19F2FF2A0"/>
of the age, there was no very oftenſible reaſon for the peremptorineſs of Ellen's negative.</p>
                     <p>It had been ſufficient with her, that he did not raiſe one emotion of any kind in her mind, and that marriage was the thing leaſt in her thoughts, and her wiſhes. But the talkers around her ſought for ſome leſs ſimple cauſe, to account for a young woman of ſmall fortune, refuſing to ſettle herſelf advantageouſly in the world. With many it was imputed to her deſign of becoming lady Sinclair. But ſir William knew that this was not the caſe. Others averred that ſhe had fixed her hopes and deſigns upon ſir William himſelf: and this ſir William felt not at all diſpoſed to queſtion. He was complimented by ſo many upon his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, that he began to perſuade himſelf, (what cannot love and vanity perſuade a man to?) that if ſhe refuſed the rich and the young, it was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his merit had penetrated her heart. The complaiſance and attention with which ſhe always liſtened to him, and the ſuperiority that his per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal attractions and outward manners gave him over all the other men who approached her, made this no very extraordinary or unpardonable miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take. On this miſtake he grounded his reſolution of explaining himſelf to mr. Mordaunt.</p>
                     <p>The ſpring was now far advanced: and the family were to quit Bath in leſs than a fortnight. Sir William therefore wiſhed, before he loſt ſight of them, to leave no doubt of his future intentions. He accordingly opened his heart to mr. Mordaunt: but he repreſented to him that being only a few weeks returned to England, he had much buſineſs to adjuſt before he could enter into matrimony. He therefore propoſed to arrange his affairs, to viſit his country reſidence, and afterwards, if mr.
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:036127_0119_10084FC605CDB7C0"/>
Mordaunt encouraged him to hope, he flattered himſelf he might be allowed to pay his devoirs to Ellen, in Northumberland.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt received ſir William's declaration with manifeſt pleaſure; and with the frankneſs that diſtinguiſhed his character, immediately in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed him of the attachment that had ſubſiſted between Ellen and Henry. He repreſented the caſe exactly as it was; and aſſured ſir William, that he had no doubt but that Ellen's mind grew every day more free from every remains of predi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection in her couſin's favour. But he gave it as his opinion, that as ſir William muſt of neceſſity be ſome weeks before he could openly declare himſelf, it might be productive of good effects, if he deferred his intended viſit into Northumberland 'till the autumn. In the mean time, mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt promiſed to obſerve the inclinations of his daughter, and to deal with perfect fairneſs in the repreſentations he ſhould make of them, from time to time, to ſir William.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt, who could not conceive that a man, who had paſſed his fortieth year, could expect a young woman, not yet twenty, to have fallen in love with him, or that it was probable that ſhe ſhould not have had ſome attachment or prepoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion more ſuited to her years, had no ſuſpicion that by the frankneſs of his dealing he pierced ſir William's heart with the moſt ſenſible diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and opened it in future to all the tortures of rage and jealouſy.</p>
                     <p>This prior love of Ellen's explained in a way not at all flattering to ſir William's vanity, her indifference to the riches of ſir John Sinclair, and the youth of mr. Bowden: and if he were to hope it were to be overcome in his favour, he
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:036127_0120_10084FC911044708"/>
found he was to owe his better fortune rather to time, and perhaps to the recommendation of a parent, intereſted in his behalf, than to his own merit.</p>
                     <p>The chagrin that he felt on this diſcovery made him readily come into mr. Mordaunt's propoſal, that any farther declaration ſhould be delayed: and he deſigned to quit Bath without again ſeeing Ellen. Accident however prevented this. Going to viſit mr. Mordaunt one evening, when he had underſtood ſhe was to be at the ball, he found her in the drawing room: and ſhe appeared, from the accidental mode of her dreſs, or from ſome other cauſe, more attractive in her manner and appearance, than he had ever before thought her.</p>
                     <p>"I feared," ſaid he, the moment he ſaw her, "that you were to have been at the ball."</p>
                     <p>"Then I am not to flatter myſelf," ſaid ſhe gaily, "that this viſit is to me?"</p>
                     <p>"Should you think it flattering if it were ſo?"</p>
                     <p>"I am not ſure I ſhould call it flattering; but I am ſure I ſhould call it very pleaſant."</p>
                     <p>There was a naïvete and truth in theſe words, that went to ſir William's heart.</p>
                     <p>"If I am not to be the firſt man ſhe has loved," ſaid he to himſelf, "I may be the ſecond. And if from this moment I might be the only one, I ſhould be happy."</p>
                     <p>In this night's converſation, mr. Mordaunt was wholly forgotten: and ſir William's attentions and admiration were ſo apparent, that Ellen could not help ſeeing him in a light he had never ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to her in before. When he was gone, mr. Mordaunt ventured to rally Ellen on her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt: and ſhe replied with ſo much praiſe of ſir
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:036127_0121_10084FCBA7895A68"/>
William, that mr. Mordaunt thought himſelf in poſſeſſion of his wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>The effect this evening had upon ſir William, was ſuch, that inſtead of leaving Bath at the time he deſigned, he continued there till the laſt mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of mr. Mordaunt's ſtay; and ſpent ſo many hours in his houſe, and with Ellen, that ſhe could not doubt, but that, at leaſt for the preſent, ſhe had found the way to his heart. This was a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covery that certainly gave her no pleaſure; but neither did it excite much pain, nor give her any very lively alarm. There was ſomething ſo guarded even in the admiration that ſir William expreſſed, as eaſily perſuaded Ellen, who had no vanity to counteract her wiſhes, that he thought not of her as a wife, and that when once out of ſight, ſhe ſhould be thought of no more. It was, however, with great ſatisfaction, that ſhe ſaw her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf removed from Bath: and the ſight of Groby Manor made her heart throb with delight. "Here," ſaid ſhe to herſelf, "I ſhall find an aſylum from all gallantry. In thoſe ſhades there will be no concert but the concert of the birds, no dancing but the quivering of the leaves."</p>
                     <p>She flew to the parſonage.</p>
                     <p>"My friends," ſaid ſhe, as ſhe embraced firſt one and then the other, "I have not known ſo happy a moment as this, ſince we parted."</p>
                     <p>Her return to Groby Manor ſeemed to give her new life: and, unknown to herſelf, the eſcape ſhe thought ſhe had had from ſir William Ackland, diffuſed peace and cheerfulneſs over her mind.</p>
                     <p>She reſumed all her occupations with a ſpirit which ſhe had not experienced ſince her loſs of Henry: and mr. Mordaunt thought himſelf autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rized
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:036127_0122_10084FCEB0BB24B8"/>
in giving ſir William the moſt flattering ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts of her diſpoſitions.</p>
                     <p>Ellen had, however, one continual cauſe of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs, which neither her reaſon nor her pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience could preſerve her from feeling. This was the increaſed ill humour of her mother. Baffled in her ſcheme of marrying her, perſuaded that Ellen in ſecret meant to preſerve herſelf for Henry, her reſentment and malice towards her knew no bounds. There was no one moment of the day when ſhe did not make her feel the fangs of her malevolence. All mr. Mordaunt's authority could not ſhield Ellen from the ſtorm. The tongue is an inſtrument of evil that cannot be reſtrained. Bitter taunts, and ſevere reproaches, may be reſented; but cannot, when we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled to live with the tormentor, be avoided. Ellen's duplicity and preſumption were the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinual topics of her mother's diſcourſe: and with theſe ſhe took care to mingle the moſt confident aſſurances that all would prove vain, and that Henry would return to England only to marry lady Almeria.</p>
                     <p>From ſuch attacks, Ellen took refuge, whenever ſhe could, at the parſonage: but they made mr. Mordaunt more and more impatient to ſee her under the protection of a man of worth, and to have her prove, by her marriage, the falſeneſs of mrs. Mordaunt's calumnies.</p>
                     <p>Sir William grew impatient to viſit Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland: and mr. Mordaunt determined to delay his conſent no longer than till he had opened the matter fully to Ellen.</p>

                     <p>ONE day, when mrs. Mordaunt had been more than commonly injurious, Ellen had withdrawn herſelf to her favourite wood, and had juſt eaſed her ſwelling heart, by a flood of tears, when her father, who had purpoſely followed her from the houſe, joined her. She would have concealed her emotion.</p>
                     <p>"My dear Ellen," ſaid he, "your mother de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves no delicacy from you. Do not, for her ſake, deprive me of your full confidence: the ſympathy of one parent is but a due compenſation for the cruelty of another."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="126" facs="unknown:036127_0124_10084FD5E544E4C0"/>"Your kindneſs, my father," ſaid the weep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Ellen, "is a compenſation for every evil: and I ought to bear injuries that I have not deſerved, with more fortitude."</p>
                     <p>"I ought to remove you from the preſſure of ſuch injuries: and I would do ſo too, even at the hazard of never ſeeing my wife again, did I not hope a more amicable end to all your oppreſſions, and ſuch a one as will give the lie direct to all your mother's unjuſt imputations."</p>
                     <p>Ellen regarded her father with a look of timid ſurpriſe.</p>
                     <p>"What do you mean, ſir?"</p>
                     <p>"Your marriage with a man of worth will ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure your own happineſs; and prove, beyond all diſpute, the ſincerity and good faith of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation, the motives for which are now ſo daily called in queſtion.</p>
                     <p>"My marriage!" repeated Ellen, faintly.</p>
                     <p>"I want no further proof," cried mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt warmly, "of the ſtrength of your mind, and the purity of your principles. I know, that the ſacrifice you appeared to make, was ſincere, that you never looked to futurity for an indemni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication for preſent loſſes: and I ſee, with equal pleaſure and admiration, that you are capable of receiving happineſs from another ſource than that which is dried up to you for ever. It is not, my love, that I am putting your honeſty to the teſt: but it is that I think I am offering a reward to your virtues, when I talk to you of other con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions, when I name marriage."</p>
                     <p>"Marriage?" again repeated Ellen.</p>
                     <p>"Were your home as happy as I could wiſh to make it, yet marriage would be deſirable. Half the female virtues fade, or are uſeleſs, except in
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:036127_0125_10084FD86FB885B0"/>
marriage. You are formed to adorn them all: and having ſuffered as a daughter, it is proper you ſhould be rewarded as a wife."</p>
                     <p>"As a wife?" ſaid Ellen.</p>
                     <p>"As a wife, my love; nor can I believe that with a man whom you could love, there is any thing very dreadful in the name of wife. Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Ackland ſeeks and deſerves your love. In giving you to him, I believe I ſecure your happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs: and have I not obſerved that he is not diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agreeable to you?"</p>
                     <p>"Diſagreeable! no, certainly."</p>
                     <p>"His perſon, his converſation pleaſes you. You think him worthy, amiable?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes."</p>
                     <p>"You are not unconſcious that he admires you?"</p>
                     <p>"No."</p>
                     <p>"It would not be ungrateful to you that he ſhould love you?"</p>
                     <p>Ellen was ſilent.</p>
                     <p>"Dear Ellen, why theſe monoſyllables? Why this ſilence?"</p>
                     <p>Ellen gaſped for breath. Mr. Mordaunt took her hand. It was cold.</p>
                     <p>"You are ill?"</p>
                     <p>"No, I am better." And throwing herſelf into her father's arms, ſhe burſt into tears.</p>
                     <p>"Dear ſir, forgive me. I will not be leſs all you wiſh me, notwithſtanding theſe fooliſh tears."</p>
                     <p>"They are not tears of reluctance, Ellen? I mean not to diſtreſs you. You are and ſhall be miſtreſs of yourſelf."</p>
                     <p>"It muſt come to this. I knew it would come to this! I will not abuſe your indulgence. But leave me, dear ſir, leave me: In two hours I will
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:036127_0126_10084FD9F66C1160"/>
tell you what I think I can do, what I believe I ought to do."</p>
                     <p>"I will leave you, my love: but do nothing merely becauſe you think I wiſh it. Let the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons why I wiſh it, have their weight, but not the wiſh itſelf."</p>
                     <p>"Impoſſible! your wiſh muſt be a motive with me."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt retired: and Ellen haſtened, as faſt as her trembling limbs would carry her, to the parſonage. She found the little family aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled in that woodbine bower, where ſo many happy hours of her childhood had been paſſed, where ſhe had ſo often ſtudied and ſo often idled with Henry, where ſhe had a hundred times re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived his vows of everlaſting love, and where ſhe had as often promiſed never to forſake him. The recollection was too painful: ſhe ſtopt ſhort. Her limbs failed her. Mr. Thornton caught her in his arms; and then giving her a glaſs of water, ſhe reſted her head on mr. Thornton's ſhoulder, and was ſaved by tears from fainting.</p>
                     <p>Mr. and mrs. Thornton hung over her with true parental affection, terrified with an emotion they had never witneſſed in her before, yet afraid to increaſe her diſtreſs by inquiring into the cauſe.</p>
                     <p>Mary, as much alarmed, and leſs conſiderate, cried, "Dear, dear Ellen, what's the matter? Who now has done you wrong?"</p>
                     <p>"No one; myſelf I think. I did not think I ſhould have been ſo overcome. I meant to have been quite calm."</p>
                     <p>"But what, what is the matter?"</p>
                     <p>"Oh! my friends, you muſt adviſe me. Yet, already I know what I ought to do."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="129" facs="unknown:036127_0127_10084FDB862CDF20"/>"Sir William Ackland would marry you?" interrupted Mary.</p>
                     <p>"My poor Ellen," ſaid mr. Thornton.</p>
                     <p>"My dear ſir, my ſecond father," ſaid Ellen, looking up to mr. Thornton. "You ſhall be my caſuiſt. You ſhall decide for me. What you determine, will be right aad good."</p>
                     <p>"Dear Ellen, you have decided yourſelf. What is eligible, what tends to your happineſs nobody can doubt. The queſtion is, what can you do?"</p>
                     <p>"I <hi>can</hi> do that which you adviſe me to do."</p>
                     <p>"Sir William is pleaſant to your fancy, and approved of by your underſtanding. He is ami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, he is kind: plain ſenſe requires no other qualifications in the object of affection."</p>
                     <p>"But if the heart is not free?" ſaid Mary.</p>
                     <p>"Will Ellen make that plea?" ſaid mr. Thornton.</p>
                     <p>"No. If my heart is not yet ſir William Ackland's, I mean not to reſerve it for another."</p>
                     <p>"What is the heart but the power of beſtow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing affections where there is merit enough to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve them? Does not ſir William Ackland poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſs that merit? And where can you look for mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried happineſs with better hopes of ſucceſs than with him?"</p>
                     <p>"No where I believe."</p>
                     <p>"You are above the romantic notion of living ſingle all your life, from having experienced one diſappointment; a notion, to ſay nothing of the falſe and ſelfiſh principles upon which it is grounded, that is uſually attended by a much ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verer ſenſe of diſappointment than any occaſioned by the events that gave birth to it."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="130" facs="unknown:036127_0128_10084FE0331E8858"/>"I hope I am. I have always diſdained ſuch a notion."</p>
                     <p>"Have you one objection, which you would wiſh to act from, to an union with ſir William?"</p>
                     <p>"No."</p>
                     <p>"Then, my dear Ellen," ſaid mr. Thornton, embracing her, "the queſtion is decided. And if ſir William is the man you and mr. Mordaunt deſcribe him to be, your happineſs is alſo decided. No retroſpect will ever diſturb it."</p>
                     <p>"I am willing to think ſo: but I miſtruſt my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The emotion I have now betrayed —"</p>
                     <p>"If I ſaw you inſenſible I ſhould be leſs ſure of your happineſs. But the ſame ſentiments that formed your firſt attachment, will form your ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond. It is upon ſir William's merits and your power of appreciating thoſe merits, that I ground my aſſurance of your happineſs. Your affection for him will fill the preſent void in your heart, will give a motive for action, and an intereſt to duty. If you have thought it poſſible for thoſe who have loſt you to be happy in a ſecond choice, you will not be able to ſuppoſe you cannot be ſo, without making yourſelf too much, or too little of a compliment."</p>
                     <p>Ellen had nothing to reply to this; but turning to mrs. Thornton, ſaid, "And you, my dear mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, do you ratify this ſentence?"</p>
                     <p>"Indeed I do. It is the dictate of good ſenſe and good principles; high treaſon, I allow, againſt the laws of romance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but when did you ever refer your actions to that fantaſtical code?"</p>
                     <p>"Never, thanks to you, my beſt friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and now I think I may engage I never ſhall."</p>
                     <p>"I long to know ſir William," ſaid mr. Thornton.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="131" facs="unknown:036127_0129_10084FE310744BA8"/>"He will meet with your approbation, I have no doubt."</p>
                     <p>"Then muſt he have more than common me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit: leſs will not ſatisfy me, when I am looking for a huſband for you."</p>
                     <p>Ellen faintly ſmiled; and aſking Mary, whoſe ſilence had marked her diſſatisfaction, to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany her home, ſaid ſhe had promiſed, on parting with her father, to ſee him again in two hours.</p>
                     <p>"Heaven bleſs you, my dear child," ſaid mr. and mrs. Thornton, both in a breath: and mr. Thornton added, "if moderation and rationality were to be perſonified, they would take no other form than Ellen's."</p>
                     <p>Ellen's heart was full. She preſſed their hands between her's; and ſcarcely uttering 'adieu,' walked along with Mary.</p>
                     <p>Mary had much in her mind: but of all that was there, ſhe was not able to utter a ſyllable. Ellen talked of the ſoftneſs of the evening, the fragrance of the woodbines, and the melody of the birds. Mary could neither ſmell nor hear. Ellen changed the ſubject; and inquired con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the laſt new book ſhe had read, and whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the colours in her flower-piece ſtood. Mary could bear no more.</p>
                     <p>"Oh! Ellen," cried ſhe, throwing her arms around her, "I could not do as you do."</p>
                     <p>"You could if you would. What your father ſaid was unanſwerable. My judgment is tho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roughly with him."</p>
                     <p>"And is it a matter of judgment?"</p>
                     <p>"Aſſuredly. What but our judgment ſhall correct the miſtakes of our hearts?"</p>
                     <p>"I can eaſily excuſe my judgment that office. I hope it will never be called to it."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="132" facs="unknown:036127_0130_10084FE59C006560"/>"You will be the happier. But, educated as you and I have been, in the ſame ſchool, in the ſame circumſtances, I have no doubt, but our conduct would be the ſame."</p>
                     <p>"It is eaſier to admire than to imitate you. All Ariſtotle's pupils were not Alexanders."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt, in whoſe breaſt Ellen's agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation had raiſed the moſt painful apprehenſions, had counted every moment ſince ſhe quitted him, with the moſt anxious impatience: and no longer able to wait quietly her return, he had bent his ſteps towards the parſonage. He met Ellen and Mary. From the firſt glance of Ellen's eye, he learnt all he wiſhed to know. "A bleſſing will follow all you do, my dear Ellen," ſaid he; "for all you do is founded upon good ſenſe and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety."</p>
                     <p>"If I am right in your eyes, and not ſelf-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, I know not that there is any thing more in this world to be wiſhed for," ſaid Ellen.</p>
                     <p>"You have, indeed, laid the beſt foundation for happineſs: and I entertain not a doubt but the ſuperſtructure will be all our moſt anxious love can deſire."</p>

                     <p>SIR WILLIAM received mr. Mordaunt's ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons to Groby Manor with a mixture of the moſt lively pleaſure, and the moſt tormenting ſolicitude. He could not doubt of Ellen's determination in his favour: but he doubted the motives that had produced it. He had begun his attentions to her by a ſcrupulous weighing of her merits and ble<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhes: and he had ended in the moſt decided and ardent paſſion. To be happy, he muſt be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved, be beloved preferably, and almoſt exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſively. To be leſs than all to Ellen, was, in ſir William's mind, to be little more than nothing. His vanity could ſcarcely hope, or his reaſon deſire this: and yet leſs than this would by him, before marriage, be lamented as a misfortune, and after marriage be puniſhed as a fault.</p>
                     <p>He haſted down into Northumberland op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed by doubt, yet too much in love to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to be governed even by a confirmation of his doubts.</p>
                     <p>The ſight of Ellen increaſed his love and his fears. He found her gentle, complacent, yielding:
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:036127_0132_10084FEC5CCD2B40"/>
but to all the ſymptoms of paſſion with which he was infected, he found nothing correſpondent in Ellen. From the even tenor of her ſpirits, and the perfect freedom in which he was convinced her choice had been left by her father, he could not ſuſpect that ſhe was influenced in her accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of him by any motives but ſuch as ſhe avowed—a ſenſe of his merits, and a conviction that her life would paſs happily with him: but thoſe ſentiments were far ſhort of thoſe he wiſhed to inſpire. He had been told ſhe had loved Henry. She could therefore love. The anima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of character which ſhe diſplayed in all ſhe did, put the matter out of doubt. Her warmth of friendſhip for Mary, her attachment to her father, were farther proofs, if any had been wanting. Sir William already began to think it an injury to him, that, with the ardent feelings ſhe poſſeſſed, ſhe ſeemed to grant him only eſteem.</p>
                     <p>To the querulous reproaches that ſometimes eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caped him, Ellen oppoſed at times a good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moured raillery; and at others, with a frank ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſty, would refer him to time and his own vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as the only grounds on which he could build the probable ſucceſs of his deſires.</p>
                     <p>"And have you no notion of any love but what is grounded on the merits of the object?" Sir William would aſk.</p>
                     <p>"Certainly not."</p>
                     <p>"And do you never love but in exact propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to thoſe merits?"</p>
                     <p>"I don't ſay ſo," ſaid Ellen, with a bluſh.</p>
                     <p>"And yet you refer me to my merits?"</p>
                     <p>"As the ground-work; that once laid, let me alone for the ſuperſtructure."</p>
                     <p>"Is it not laid?" aſked ſir William peeviſhly.</p>

                     <p>"Are you always ſo tardy in works of love?"</p>
                     <p>"All my loves," ſaid Ellen with emotion, have hitherto
<q>'Grown with my growth, and ſtrengthened with my ſtrength.'</q>
I am of ſlow capacity, and cannot ſeize an idea the moment it is offered me. You muſt not expect to reap before you have ſown: but wait the ſeaſon, and be aſſured you ſhall have a full harveſt."</p>
                     <p>So Ellen felt; and ſo Ellen believed. She ſaw much in ſir William to eſteem, and much to like. Every day he grew more intereſting to her. The happineſs ſhe already began to feel, ſhe imputed to him. She did not trouble herſelf to analyze it too ſcrupulouſly, nor to examine how much ought to be referred to the unbounded content that ſhone in her father's countenance, how much to the new-born kindneſs of her mother, how much to the ſatisfaction of her ſiſters, who ſaw in her marriage the probable ſphere of their pleaſures much enlarged. If ſhe adverted to any circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance as making a part of her happineſs, inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendent of ſir William, it was a ſelf gratulation on acting right, and a conviction that ſhe ſhould not by her new connexions grieve Henry. She underſtood, as a certainty, that in a few months he was to return and marry lady Almeria. This circumſtance had not, 'tis true, made any part of her motives for her preſent conduct: but it was impoſſible not to conſider it as an addition to the perſonal happineſs ſhe promiſed herſelf. The fear that in yielding ſo implicitly to his father's will, he had been too careleſs of that felicity which
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:036127_0134_10084FF08E6180D8"/>
only can be ſecured by the wiſe choice of a partner for life, would ſometimes obtrude itſelf: but ſhe drove it from her.</p>
                     <p>It is preſumptuous in me, (thought ſhe), to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide a queſtion of which I know ſo little. Lady Almeria may have all the virtues and perfections that I wiſh her to have. I hardly know her. Shall I, by judging her harſhly, make myſelf unhappy?</p>
                     <p>There were other uncertain thoughts and vague ſuſpicions, which ſhe found herſelf, when they occurred, leſs able to baniſh from her mind, and which touched her own intereſts nearer.</p>
                     <p>Theſe were ſome doubts of the goodneſs of ſir William's temper, and the liberality of his mind. She ſcarcely knew from what ſuch ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions aroſe; perhaps from a word or look to a ſervant, an opinion careleſsly dropped in common converſation, an over ſolicitude for trifles, a ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing falling ſhort as it were of the thing ſhe wiſhed, rather than any thing directly inimical to it. She had to oppoſe to theſe ſuſpicions, the generoſity and handſomeneſs with which ſhe knew he had dealt in all matters of ſettlement, and in all tranſactions with her father—the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>varied good-humour and ſweetneſs of temper he diſplayed towards her—with the exception of what might be called the complainings of too ardent a love, an exception, which, however ſhe might lament it, ſhe hardly knew how to charge upon him as a fault.</p>
                     <p>To theſe were added, the gaiety and pleaſant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his converſation, and his deſire of accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modation in all matters in which ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned. Sometimes ſhe thought this a little ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died. But ſhe checked herſelf in what ſhe thought might be too great a faſtidiouſneſs: and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:036127_0135_10084FF21E32D1D8"/>
ſhe feared, that whatever idea aroſe in her mind to the diſadvantage of ſir William, might be wholly owing to a compariſon, which, do what ſhe would, would ſometimes force itſelf upon her. When this thought occurred, ſhe condemned her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf as unjuſt, and almoſt criminal: and ſir William was dearer to her from the ſenſe of the injury ſhe thought ſhe had done him.</p>
                     <p>In a word, he had made that progreſs in her heart, and ſhe had ſo accuſtomed herſelf to conſider him as the perſon who was henceforth to be her beſt friend, that it depended wholly upon ſir William's ſelf to ſecure her love and her happineſs for life.</p>
                     <p>It is not to be doubted, that lord Villars re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the accounts of Ellen's intended marriage with the moſt heart-felt ſatisfaction: but it was a ſatisfaction that he judged it expedient, at preſent, to conceal carefully from his ſon. He imagined that he could never plead ſuch an example of ſubmiſſion ſo irreſiſtibly as in the moment when the final and certain overthrow of all his hopes ſhould fill the breaſt of Henry with grief, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, and probably reſentment.</p>
                     <p>Lord Villars entreated his ſiſter to keep Ellen as happy and pleaſed with herſelf as poſſible, and by the moſt marked change in her conduct to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, and the moſt unbounded approbation of her preſent deſigns, to make her, if poſſible, forget the diſappointment of her love, in the gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of her vanity. Hence the change of mrs. Mordaunt's behaviour to her daughter, in which the good heart of Ellen ſo ſincerely rejoiced.</p>
                     <p>Lord Villars wrote to mr. Mordaunt, beſeech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him to renew their intercourſe and friendſhip:
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:036127_0136_10084FF6E6083C90"/>
and mr. Mordaunt, whoſe nature knew not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placability, accepted the olive-branch. Lord Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars ventured one ſtep further; and ſent to Ellen, as a bridal preſent, a coſtly ornament of pearls.</p>
                     <p>Ellen felt this as an inſult, as though her deſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Henry was to be paid with a pearl neck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lace. From the man who had ſo unrelentingly refuſed her happineſs, ſhe could not accept of ornament: and ſhe returned, with very civil ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, the expenſive trinket.</p>
                     <p>Sir William was acquainted with this circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance: and Ellen ſaw, with a very ſenſible pain, that it diſpleaſed him. He was more willing that ſhe ſhould ſacrifice the dignity of her mind, than that ſhe ſhould betray any remaining reſentment to the perſon who had ſeparated her from Henry.</p>
                     <p>But the thing was done, and could not be recalled. She endeavoured, however, to convince ſir William, that what ſhe had done, was not from a feeling of reſentment, but from that deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacy which forbids receiving obligation of any kind, and eſpecially of a pecuniary ſort, from thoſe of whom we think ill. And ſhe added, with a ſoftneſs which ought to have ſubdued diſpleaſure, even juſtly founded, that ſhe would have ſacrificed even this delicacy, rather than have done what was unpleaſing to him.</p>

                     <p>WHILE theſe things were tranſacting in Northumberland, Henry was amuſing himſelf extremely well in Italy, perfectly unconſcious of the blow that awaited him. He had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with Ellen's journey to Bath, and had ſuffered the moſt cruel uneaſineſs as to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable conſequence of that expedition. But his heart had recovered its compoſure, and reſumed its hopes, when he knew that ſhe was returned diſengaged into Northumberland. Although ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated by ſeas and mountains, the ſame ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction had filled the hearts of Henry and Ellen, on her being again ſheltered, as they both hoped, by the ſhades of Groby Manor, from the dangers of ſolicitation, and ſcreened from the poſſibility of notice.</p>
                     <p>This ſhelter had proved vain: and Henry now learnt, although indiſtinctly, and from doubtful authority, of Ellen's intended marriage with ſir William Ackland. On the thought of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance that divided Italy from England, an icy coldneſs ran through his veins. There was no ſtaying there in all the horror of uncertainty, to be made perhaps ſtill more wretched, by being put out of doubt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="140" facs="unknown:036127_0138_10084FFC34F01020"/>He quitted Venice on the inſtant: and with a rapidity far ſhort of his deſires, but almoſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond his powers, he arrived in England. Here he loitered not for information: but, more and more alarmed by that which reached him as he travelled on, with the ſame breathleſs haſte he urged his way into Northumberland.</p>
                     <p>Here, at the parſonage, on the cloſe of a fine day, in September, the moon giving a more af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting tint to objects, the ſight of which, from the variety of emotions that they raiſed, almoſt ſhook his frame to diſſolution, arrived the wretched Henry.</p>
                     <p>He aſked, in a voice ſcarcely articulate, for mr. and mrs. Thornton; and was told they were at Groby Manor. His informer was a female: and ſhe added, "for miſs Ellen is to be married to-morrow: and my miſtreſs is gone to take leave of her."</p>
                     <p>Henry felt the adder's f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>g in his heart: and caſting up a look of deſpair, that rather ſeemed to menace than to ſupplicate, he ruſhed forward, and, unknowing what he did or what he meant to do, ſoon reached the wood that adjoined to Groby Manor.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt the few penſioners to whom Ellen's limited means enabled her to extend her bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence, was a poor woman, who, to the burden of fourſcore years, added infirmity and misfortune. To her neceſſities Ellen had often ſacrificed the variety of her dreſs, and the power of purchaſing new books, or new muſic: and it was to Ellen not amongſt the leaſt pleaſing circumſtances of her approaching marriage, that it would enable her to ſecure poor Deborah from all the diſtreſſes of penury for the remainder of her life. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing,
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:036127_0139_10084FFEE5B75D70"/>
however, ſeemed ſufficient to conſole the old woman for the approaching loſs of the daily viſits of her beloved benefactreſs: and Ellen made it a point, not to remit her attentions while it was in her power to continue them.</p>
                     <p>The hurry of the preceding day had prevented her uſual viſit to Deborah: but as the cottage did not ſtand more than five hundred yards from Groby Manor, juſt on the outſide of the wood, ſhe had withdrawn from her friends, while they were aſſembled at tea, to give one quarter of an hour to Deborah, to bid her adieu, and beſtow her parting bounty; for Ellen was to depart on the morrow.</p>
                     <p>She was returning from this humane viſitation, ſoftened by the gratitude and the bleſſings of the poor creature ſhe had left, her mind full of paſt ſcenes, and future expectations, when on a ſudden Henry's figure ſtood before her.</p>
                     <p>Ellen neither ſhrieked nor fainted. But ſhe doubted not but that which ſhe ſaw was ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natural, 'till Henry, who, on the ſight of her, felt every tumultuous paſſion diſſolve into the moſt melting tenderneſs, ruſhed forward and claſped her in his arms.</p>
                     <p>"Am I to believe my ſenſes? are you indeed Henry?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, yes, I am Henry, the forgotten Henry. I know I came unlooked for, undeſired. But I come to claim my own; to ſave you from the ſin of inconſtancy."</p>
                     <p>"Inconſtancy! Do you charge me with in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſtancy?"</p>
                     <p>"Yes, thou dear falſe one, yes. Can you deny the charge?"</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="142" facs="unknown:036127_0140_100850021BB63530"/>"Moſt confidently. But, dear Henry, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe yourſelf. What means this ſudden appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? What mean thoſe looks, ſo eager and ſo wild?"</p>
                     <p>"Are you not married?"</p>
                     <p>"No."</p>
                     <p>"Are you not betrothed?"</p>
                     <p>"I beſeech you be calm. I will hear all you have to ſay. I will ſatisfy you fully. But do not terrify me thus. You will drive my reaſon from her ſeat."</p>
                     <p>"Do I terrify you? Forgive me? deareſt, beſt-beloved of creatures, forgive me. You talk of reaſon. Mine indeed is gone, is loſt. Put your hand here, here—feel here. Do you not feel the burning chain with which my brain is bound?"</p>
                     <p>"We will ſit down here. We will converſe together. You cannot feel pain any where, Henry, that I ſhall not commiſerate."</p>
                     <p>"How ſoft is your voice! How kind your ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cents! Oh, Ellen, you ſhould not thus have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>done me."</p>
                     <p>A flood of tears ſtopt his ſpeech. He wept, concealing his face in Ellen's garment. She hung over him in unutterable diſtreſs, and ſought to ſooth him by the kindeſt words of the moſt heart-felt compaſſion.</p>
                     <p>At length, he became more calm: and, ſtarting up, "I meant not," ſaid he, "to play the madman and the fool. But let us reaſon the matter to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether. I will walk from you for a few moments; and having recovered my underſtanding, will try to keep it."</p>
                     <p>This was a ſeaſonable relief to Ellen, and gave her time to rally all her faculties; for the ſight of
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:036127_0141_10085003A5ED4A20"/>
Henry, and Henry in ſuch diſtreſs, had deprived her of every power of recollection, and made her ſenſible only to the extremeſt miſery.</p>
                     <p>"I think I ſhall not again terrify you," ſaid Henry, returning to her. "I think I can be maſter of myſelf. But, Ellen, I come to call you to a ſevere account. I come to reckon with you for my ruin."</p>
                     <p>"How innocent I am of your ruin in act, or wiſh, I will not tell you, Henry; for you <hi>know.</hi> I will not tell you to turn your mind to paſt tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actions. My exculpation, I am ſure, is written in your heart, and cannot be forgotten."</p>
                     <p>"Is it your exculpation, that you have ſacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficed the trueſt love to a vain ambition? Is it your exculpation, that from diſintereſtedneſs, pure as what angels feel, you are become ſordid, merce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary?'</p>
                     <p>"Cruel Henry!—No, my dear couſin, you are not cruel; you are not even miſtaken. You know I am not mercenary. You know I am not ſordid. You know me thoroughly; and can be at no loſs for the real motives of my conduct."</p>
                     <p>"I know you thoroughly!—No, no.—Once indeed—"</p>
                     <p>"No retroſpect:—It is not only upon the preſent occaſion, I have promiſed to forbear it; and to give it is not only uſeleſs but detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental."</p>
                     <p>"Cool, reaſonable Ellen! But it is falſe, diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled. You ſhall not perſuade me that you forget."</p>
                     <p>"I forget nothing. I ſhould be ſorry to lay the foundation of my duty in the loſs of my fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties."</p>
                     <p>"And do you indeed remember? Deareſt

                     <p>Ellen rouſed herſelf from the temporary ſtupe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction that had ſeized her; and, riſing, returned with all the haſte in her power to the houſe.</p>
                     <p>Her abſence had already given occaſion for ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe and inquiry: and Mary had ſuggeſted, as its probable cauſe, a farewel viſit to old Deborah.</p>
                     <p>It had, however, been protracted until it had produced a conſiderable degree of anxiety in the breaſts of thoſe who thought every moment of her abſence an hour.</p>
                     <p>Mary and ſir William were about to have come in ſearch of her, when, from the windows of the room where they were, they ſaw her approach. They ran towards her: and Mary, in accents of ſolicitude, and ſir William in thoſe of reproach, eagerly enquired where ſhe had been.</p>

"That poor creature's gratitude was ſure to be too much for you. How much better had it been that you had been playing and ſinging with us."</p>
                     <p>"I will play and ſing with you now," ſaid Ellen: and in a hurried and fluttered manner haſtily ſat down to the harpſichord. She touched the keys: but it was diſcord, not harmony, that ſhe produced. Every eye was fixed upon her. Her father drew near with extreme anxiety: and ſir William, who had kept cloſe to her from the moment he had met her, ſaid, with a tone of chagrin and reproach, "this viſit to an old woman has ſtrangely diſcompoſed you."</p>
                     <p>"I am indeed extremely diſcompoſed," re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned ſhe; and riſing, "my father, let me ſpeak to you."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt, ſtruck with a deadly fear, though he knew not of what, put his arm round her waiſt — ſhe had need of the ſupport—and withdrew with her into another room.</p>
                     <p>There a ſeaſonable burſt of tears relieved the almoſt burſting heart of Ellen. But recovered from this agitation, ſhe ſought to quiet, by a recital of every circumſtance, the agonizing alarm that, ſhe perceived, had ſeized her father. The nar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative, however, far from alleviating, increaſed every apprehenſion he had before felt. In it he thought he ſaw the wreck of Ellen's happineſs, and in her happineſs that of her reputation. He thought he ſaw the intended marriage with ſir William broken, and broken from a revived paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for another man; a paſſion which ought to have been extinguiſhed for ever before ſuch a marriage had been thought of. But he knew not Ellen. He knew not, that the ſevereſt ſufferings for another, fearleſs for herſelf, could not turn her

aſide from the path of rectitude and reaſon. H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ſaw her agitated, alarmed, and unhappy: and he diſtinguiſhed not the ſource from whence thoſe feelings aroſe. He could not hope that it was alone pity and fear for Henry that excited them. He remained ſilent and thunderſtruck, unknowing what to ſuggeſt, or what to adviſe.</p>
                     <p>"Let me intreat you," ſaid Ellen, "to go to mr. Thornton. Let him ſeek out the wretched Henry. Let him, if poſſible, ſooth his deſpera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and lead him to patience.</p>
                     <p>"And ſir William?—What ſhall be ſaid to ſir William?"</p>
                     <p>"I will tell him myſelf every thing."</p>
                     <p>"Tell him! What will you tell him?"</p>
                     <p>"All that has paſſed. I am ſure he will join in my commiſeration for the unhappy Henry."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt felt his fears ſubſide, and his hopes revive. "So untoward a circumſtance," ſaid he heſitating, "may perhaps excite in ſir William's mind—"</p>
                     <p>"Nothing but compaſſion ſurely. How other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe can it affect ſir William? Have I ever diſavowed my affection to Henry? Have I ever pretended, that I renounced him from any conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration but that of duty? The circumſtance of to-night has not altered the grounds of that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation. It has not ſhaken the eſteem, the love I have for ſir William. They were not founded upon the abſence of Henry, but upon the good qualities and kind affections of ſir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam. My deſigns and my ſentiments are unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered. I will, indeed, confeſs my happineſs is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderably leſſened. I had been taught to believe that Henry too had ſacrificed his firſt love at the ſhrine of filial duty. This belief did not form a
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:036127_0147_10085016967EF4F8"/>
motive for my own conduct: but it contributed largely to the happineſs I hoped to draw from it. I cannot be happy while Henry is ſo perfectly wretched, and made ſo by me. But had I known the true ſtate of his mind ſome months ago, ſhould I not ſtill have acted as I have done? I was not to hold myſelf accountable to him: and now I do know it, can it, ought it to have any influence on my actions?"</p>
                     <p>"My deareſt Ellen, you are every thing that a father can wiſh. You are every thing you ought to be."</p>
                     <p>"Go, dear ſir, go, and ſend mr. Thornton in purſuit of our poor wanderer; and beg ſir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam will come to me."</p>
                     <p>The agony of ſuſpenſe and fear that ſir William had undergone during this converſation, no words can deſcribe; nor had the feelings of the reſt of the party been much leſs acute. On the return of mr. Mordaunt, they all crowded around him.</p>
                     <p>"Don't be alarmed, there is no harm.—Ellen has ſeen Henry. But go, my dear ſir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam. Go, and hear from herſelf all that has paſſed. There is nothing to be regretted in the affair but the miſery of poor Henry."</p>
                     <p>"Seen Henry!" repeated every voice, when mr. Mordaunt pronounced theſe words.</p>
                     <p>"Nothing to be regretted but the miſery of poor Henry!" ſaid ſir William, and ruſhed ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerly into the room to which Ellen had retired.</p>
                     <p>She met him with her hand held out to him, "Come, my beſt friend, come, and with your kindneſs ſooth the agitation, that compaſſion for the unhappy Henry has excited."</p>

Ellen, whoſe, ſufferings make your eyes overflow? and for whoſe loſs the bitterneſs of your regrets robs even your bridal hour of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs?"</p>
                     <p>"Away with ſuch a thought," ſaid the upright Ellen: "if my heart did not ſink within me, if my whole frame were not diſcompoſed by having been witneſs of his diſtreſs, I ſhould be unworthy of your eſteem or my own. Henry was my firſt and, had not inſuperable obſtacles interpoſed, would have been my only choice. But when I bowed before thoſe obſtacles, it was in a full and perfect ſenſe, without any mental reſervation, without any lurking hope whatever, that I ſaid I renounced him. With equal ſincerity, with equal ſingleneſs of heart, I have avowed, that your merits and your affections have made ſuch an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion on my mind, that, in conſenting to paſs the whole of my life with you, I believe I have ſecured a pure and rational felicity for the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of my days. The circumſtance of this night though it has clouded the ſerenity of my mind, has made no alteration in its ſentiments: and I ſhall to-morrow become your wife with the ſame deſires, with the ſame ſatisfaction, the ſame affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and the ſame hopes, that I ſhould have given you my hand yeſterday."</p>
                     <p>"In ſuch an aſſurance you ſeem to give me all I can aſk. Yet, how far ſhort is ſuch a modified regard, of the ardent and excluſive love I bear you."</p>
                     <p>"Be aſſured," cried Ellen fervently, "that no love can be more excluſive than mine, if you mean to confine the ſenſe of that word to the love that a wife ought to bear her huſband. If

indeed you extend it to all the ſolicitudes of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, or family affection, know, that I never felt ſuch a love. I am incapable of feeling ſuch a love: and if I were conſcious of any tendencies towards it, I ſhould think I ought to repreſs them. I can feel a preferable love, I cannot feel an excluſive one."</p>
                     <p>"You never felt ſuch a love?"</p>
                     <p>"No. And the engagements that now ſubſiſt between us, is a proof of it. Had not a parent, had not my friends, had not my duties, had each their ſhare in my heart, would thoſe ties ever have been broken, upon the diſſolution of which, thoſe that now ſubſiſt between you and me, have been founded."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, may I be able," cried ſir William, ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly embracing her, "to connect an ardent, if not an excluſive love for me, with all the energies of ſuch a character, then ſhall I be the moſt bleſt of men."</p>
                     <p>"Doubt not, but you will do ſo. Did I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve otherwiſe, no conſideration whatever would induce me to become your wife."</p>
                     <p>Sir William had then patience to liſten to the circumſtances of Henry's ſudden appearance and as ſudden departure. He liſtened, but certainly with no compaſſion correſponding to that felt by the relator; for, as he had a deeply-rooted fear of Henry's influence over the mind of Ellen, ſo he was not without a feeling towards him ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing reſembling hatred.</p>
                     <p>Ellen, though ſhe told all the truth, avoided, from a ſentiment of delicacy, to preſs u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="152" facs="unknown:036127_0150_10085020C81FF4C0"/>
that repreſented Ellen as tenderly touched for Henry, ſhewed an eager curioſity after the moſt minute circumſtance that had paſſed. He ſought to draw ſomething like cenſure of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemence Henry had diſcovered from the lips of Ellen. But this he ſought for in vain. The accents of the pureſt ſincerity were ever on thoſe lips; nor did any imagined refinement of feeling ever betray her into the wanderings of duplicity: and ſhe felt only the moſt lively and tender com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion for the ſorrows of Henry<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> She knew ſhe had herſelf been deceived, as to the ſtate of his mind; and had no doubt but that equal deceit had been practiſed towards him, though the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the falſhood was probably different. She could impute his indiſcreet appearance, his vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mence, and his diſtraction, only to his having been kept deſignedly in ignorance of the real ſituation in which ſhe had been for ſome time paſt, and from its having at length reached him in its full extent, and in ſo ſudden a manner, as to ſuſpend for a time all the reſtraints of reaſon and of pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence. All blame, therefore, was far from her mind; and never was anxiety more painful than that ſhe felt on his account.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Thornton at length returned. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed her, that he had traced Henry back to his chaiſe, which (his ſervants not having received any orders from him) had waited at the parſonage, from the moment he quitted it until he returned; that having put himſelf into it, he had driven back to the next inn, where, changing horſes, he had again purſued his journey, evidently with a deſign to eſcape as ſoon as he could, from a place which overwhelmed him with recollections he was unable to bear.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="153" facs="unknown:036127_0151_1008502278A49858"/>Ellen could not hope to hear any thing more conſolatory. Yet the idea of Henry a fugitive, under the guidance only of his ungoverned paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, flying from her, and ſuffering for her, fixed a pain in her heart, which no conſiderations on the rectitude of her own conduct, or the probable proſpect of happineſs before her could remove. Her beſt balm would have been a frank and tender participation in her ſorrows by ſir William. It would have been, on his part, the ſureſt means of avoiding the evil he dreaded. But ſhe beheld him with regret and apprehenſion, gloomy and ſilent. His attention towards her wore rather the air of ſuſpicion than of tenderneſs; and ſeemed to ſuggeſt to her the propriety of conceal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing feelings, which ſhe could not but conſider, not only as unavoidable, but laudable.</p>
                     <p>The evening wore away with little ſatisfaction on any ſide: and Ellen retired to her apartment with a fear for the peace of her future life; which not the ſudden appearance of Henry, not thoſe recollections which it had awakened in her, but the diſpoſitions which it ſeemed to have betrayed in ſir William, had impreſſed on her mind.</p>
                     <p>When Ellen appeared at breakfaſt the next morning, her countenance wore an air of thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, which no one in her preſent circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances could reprove: but ſhe had endeavoured, as much as poſſible, to baniſh all ſadneſs from it. The gay affection that ſparkled in ſir William's eyes, and the ardent love with which they were darted towards her, did more, in one inſtant, towards producing this effect, than all her reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and reſolutions, formed through a ſleepleſs night, had been able to accompliſh.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="154" facs="unknown:036127_0152_100850259A4BDB78"/>"Forgive, my deareſt love, forgive," ſaid ſir William, "all that laſt night might look like diſtruſt, or diſcontent, on my part. My feelings <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ight perhaps condemn, but my judgment wholly acquitted you: and who that knows the real value of my Ellen's heart, will wonder, that a fear, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever unjuſtly ſounded, that it was not wholly mine, ſhould overwhelm me with ſadneſs?"</p>
                     <p>"My dear ſir William, only do yourſelf juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice; and you will never have any fear concerning my heart, that can give you a moment's uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs."</p>
                     <p>Sir William, delighted, embraced her: and Ellen's almoſt loſt hope, that the road, which her reaſon had pointed out to her, as ſure to lead to happineſs, began to revive.</p>
                     <p>The marriage ceremony was performed by mr. Thornton. Mrs. Thornton and her daughter attended their beloved Ellen to church; and there they parted. The pain of this parting ſcene was mitigated on all ſides, by a firm promiſe on the part of the Thorntons, that many months ſhould not elapſe, before they viſited Berkſhire.</p>
                     <p>Charlotte accompanied her ſiſter, and mr. and mrs. Mordaunt and their eldeſt daughter were to join them at Oakley in about a month.</p>

                     <p>TO Oakley, Ellen began her journey: but in the ſituation of this country reſidence of ſir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam's, there was one circumſtance, which ſince the adventure of the preceding day, Ellen had ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to with pain.</p>
                     <p>Oakley was ſituated ſcarcely half a mile diſtant from the ſmall houſe belonging to lord Villars, to which he had retired on the death of his ſon. It was not the uſual reſidence of the family: but ſhe knew it was a favourite ſpot with Henry, and a place to which he frequently reſorted, to purſue the ſports of the field. She could not hope that he would ſoon be able to ſee her with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure, without which he ought not to ſee her at all: and ſhe felt hurt at being the cauſe of ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing him from a place, where, in the preſent ſtate of his mind, he might probably have found the moſt eligible retreat from the diſtraction and regrets that preyed upon his heart. She feared his reſource might be again to quit England: and in this continued eſtrangement from his country and family, ſhe foreſaw a probable change in his character and manner of thinking, extremely to the diſadvantage of his happineſs and principles. She knew him formed to be an uſeful and active member of ſociety, capable of fulfilling, with ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to himſelf and advantage to others, any civil
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:036127_0154_1008502B93412B30"/>
or political duty, which his rank in life, or the circumſtances of his country might call him to. To have him waſte his exiſtence in wandering from one foreign court to another, diſtant from every domeſtic and every national connection, a prey to uſeleſs repining, or the victim of frivolous pleaſures, was an idea that filled her mind with the moſt painful diſquietude—a diſquietude that aroſe almoſt beyond endurance, when ſhe ventured to aſk herſelf the queſtion, "What has driven him to this?"</p>
                     <p>Sir William obſerved, with chagrin, her anxiety, and the ſolicitude with which ſhe deſired to hear ſomething of Henry. But in every other particular he had reaſon to think himſelf the moſt fortunate of men.</p>
                     <p>The charms of Ellen's perſon and converſation, the ſweetneſs of her temper, and the unfeigned affection that her every action manifeſted towards him, left him nothing to wiſh, had he known how to regulate his wiſhes by the rule of reaſon.</p>
                     <p>But, in fact, ſir William was neither reaſonable nor amiable. Under all the exterior graces which a pleaſing perſon, poliſhed manners, and a good and cultivated underſtanding could beſtow, he was vehement in his temper, and, when thoroughly provoked, implacable. Laviſh in purſuit of his own gratifications, niggardly in promoting thoſe of others; he loved Ellen with all the ardency of paſſion; but he loved her as a poſſeſſion, in which he could not bear that any other ſhould have a ſhare. The mildneſs of her manners and the reaſonableneſs of her conduct, with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placent ſtate of mind that belongs to a ſucceſsful lover, had preſerved him, during his reſidence in Northumberland, from every poſſibility of betray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:036127_0155_1008502E13000B50"/>
his natural diſpoſition: and without deſigning to practiſe any deception, ſir William Ackland, in the firſt months of Ellen's knowledge of him, and ſir William Ackland during the reſt of his life, were two men, of diſtinct and ſeparate cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.</p>
                     <p>It was, however, only ſlowly, and by degrees, that the true and unamiable character was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſed to the unwilling obſervation of Ellen: and it was not until every doubt was done away, in the moſt calamitous certainty, that Ellen would allow herſelf to believe, that the man who could appear reaſonable, obliging, kind, and generous, was, in truth, unperſuadeable, harſh, violent, and ſelfiſh. But the diſcovery was not yet made. The preſent hour was all harmony: and the brighteſt proſpects opened before her.</p>
                     <p>She was joined by the family, from Groby Manor, at the time appointed: and ſhe learnt, with a ſatisfaction that baniſhed all ſadneſs from her mind, that Henry had ſignified his deſign to his father of taking up his abode in England. He was at preſent engaged in making an excurſion to the North of Scotland: bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> he had promiſed to join his father at the park at Chriſtmas.</p>
                     <p>In truth, however vehement and reſtleſs Henry might have been, while his mind was divided be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween hope and fear, and while inaction on his part might be acceſſary to the loſs of his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; he had no ſooner recovered from the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſm of grief and deſpair, into which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummation of his misfortune had thrown him, than he rouſed all the faculties of his mind to bear with the conſtancy and dignity of a rational creature, griefs which no impatience or extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gance could in any way leſſen.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="158" facs="unknown:036127_0156_1008502FF8AC3D60"/>Of Ellen's perſon and Ellen's character he was enamoured. He looked round; and in his idea ſaw nothing equal to her on earth: and he felt, that however impelled by paſſion, or miſled by fancy, he might in any future hour be tempted to form a temporary engagement with another woman, that there was no other whom the ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his judgment could allow as worthy to ſucceed Ellen in his affections as a wife; leaſt of all could the frivolous, the inconſequent lady Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria be worthy. He conſidered her, too, as the efficient cauſe that had ſeparated him from Ellen: and if to other woman he were indifferent, to lady Almeria he was abhorrent.</p>
                     <p>But in reſolving that no conſideration ſhould ever compel him to accept of her as a wife, he wiſhed to ſoften the obduracy of his oppoſition to his father's will as much as poſſible. It was in this light that he turned with diſapprobation from the idea that had once appeared ſeducing to him, of living like a vagabond upon earth, wandering from place to place, and finding no where a home.</p>
                     <p>"I have a home, I have a family, I have a country," ſaid he, "deareſt Ellen: with what delight, animated by your approbation, ſhould I have endeavoured to have fulfilled my duties to them all. Your love muſt no longer be my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward. But your virtue ſhall be my ſtimulator. Your eye ſhall follow me through life: and it ſhall not weep for the degeneracy of your couſin."</p>
                     <p>Three days after the marriage of Ellen, Henry was ſufficiently maſter of himſelf to form this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution, and to write the following letter in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of it to his father.</p>

                           <p>Ill would it become me, my lord, to reproach you for the deſolation you have brought upon me. I wiſh my wrongs to be as ſilent, as they are now hopeleſs of redreſs.

Let me entreat your pardon while I do ſo."</p>
                           <p>The duty I would wiſh to offer to your lord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip is unlimited obedience. But the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in which I am placed, render ſuch a duty impoſſible.

                           <p>I will be now no huſband, my lord. But, with this exception, I will endeavour to be every thing that your lordſhip can deſire. If I am taught to hope, that upon this condition I may be allowed to reſume my place in your family, and to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipate in the bleſſings of domeſtic ſociety, I will rather endeavour to find a balm for my griefs in the ſcrupulous diſcharge of my duty to my rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and country, than ſeek an aſylum in ſome foreign land, where, buried from all obſervation, I once intended, I and my ſorrows ſhould be mentioned no more. But, if—O pardon me, my lord, that I am obliged to be thus peremptory— if ſtill the perſecution, which, in its progreſs, has involved me in ſo much diſtreſs, is to be carried on, then, my lord, ſhall I be compelled to bid adieu to my native ſoil for ever.</p>

                           <p>I entreat your lordſhip, that theſe my unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable reſolves may be made known in the moſt explicit manner to any whom you may imagine they may concern.

                     <p>Lord Villars had been appriſed of Henry's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terview with Ellen, and the deſperation that he had manifeſted; and his mind had been filled with the moſt lively apprehenſions in conſequence. There was no extremity that he had not feared Henry might be driven to: and therefore the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents of this letter relieved him from a ſtate of moſt painful anxiety.</p>
                     <p>At the inſtant it was written he could expect
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:036127_0159_10085038E4B6C5F0"/>
nothing leſs than a formal renunciation of the whole ſex for Ellen's ſake: but lord Villars little feared that a man of Henry's years, and Henry's diſpoſition, would turn hermit. His deſire of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon amicable terms with his father, and his purpoſe of continuing in England, perſuaded lord Villars that time might yet produce all the effects he wiſhed.</p>
                     <p>He readily promiſed, that neither lady Almeria nor any other woman ſhould be offered to his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and manifeſted the moſt parental con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for his preſent ſufferings. "Sufferings," he ſaid, "which made his own heart bleed, and which nothing but the moſt cruel neceſſity could ever have induced him to have inflicted on a ſon, whom he loved as he did his own ſoul."</p>
                     <p>Promiſes and profeſſions coſt lord Villars noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They were equally for the preſent moment, without reference for the paſt, or thought of the future. He knew, indeed, how, by the colour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing he could give to any after events, to "keep his promiſe to the ear, and break it to the ſenſe." He deſired Henry to come directly to the park, where, whatever lord Villars did, lady Villars longed to ſee him. Henry had accordingly made them a viſit of a few days; but at the expiration of that time had gone upon a tour into the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands, hoping by the means of a variety of objects, and conſtant change of place, a little to blunt the edge of thoſe remembrances, which, while they preſerved their preſent acuteneſs, were, at mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, more that his reaſon and his fortitude could ſupport.</p>

                     <p>LORD VILLARS and his family had been amongſt ſome of Ellen's firſt viſitors. From the offenſive flattery and ſtudied fondneſs of lord Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, ſhe could not but turn with undiſguiſed averſion: but in the friendſhip and partiality of lady Villars ſhe experienced a very ſincere plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure.</p>
                     <p>Lady Villars had no very clear idea of the whole merit of Ellen's conduct: but ſhe thought herſelf under important obligations to her for the readineſs with which ſhe had quitted her rights to a connexion with her ſon; a connexion, which lady Villars honeſtly believed, would have been attended with the moſt fatal conſequences to her whole family.</p>
                     <p>Lady Villars, therefore, rejoiced in Ellen's pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſituation, as in what ſhe thought a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward for the generous ſelf denial ſhe had practiſed in her conduct towards Henry. But when ſhe ſaw with what propriety Ellen ſupported the rank of life in which ſhe was placed, how ſhe adorned and animated ſociety, and how ſhe conciliated the affections of all who approached her, ſhe could hardly repreſs a regret that any conſideration, however powerful, ſhould have ſtood in her way,
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:036127_0161_1008503F5563BD10"/>
to the ſecuring to herſelf ſuch a daughter, and her ſon ſuch a wife.</p>
                     <p>With lord and lady Villars come lady Almeria. From lady Villars, whoſe integrity forbade her concurring in any deception, ſhe had learnt the contents of Henry's letter. She therefore knew that her brows were bound with willow: but her heart ſeemed not the leſs light for this. She rattled, laughed, danced, rode, and walked with the gayeſt and happieſt of her companions; made a jeſt of Henry's cruelty; and rallied Ellen on her charms, which loſt no part of their aſcendency even over a hapleſs lover. Ellen's gravity upon ſuch occaſions would have taught any one but the inſenſible lady Almeria reſerve upon this ſubject. But lady Almeria had a love of miſchief in her diſpoſition, which no conſideration for another was ſufficient to check her in the gratification of: and though ſhe had no pleaſure in tormenting Ellen, ſhe thought it good ſport to make ſir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam jealous.</p>
                     <p>To a wild girl of little more than ſeventeen, ſir William, at paſt forty, ſeemed a Methuſalem, and ſhe thought it comical to make the old gentleman (as ſhe called him) knit his brow and pout, by talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the love and the merit of his young rival.</p>
                     <p>Lady Villars would have repreſſed this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinence. But lady Almeria was incorrigible: for, joined to no common degree of inconſideration, ſhe was ſenſible of her importance to the family, and was not unconſcious, that in ſpite of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent coldneſs of Henry, lord Villars had not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned his hopes of making her one day his daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-in-law.</p>
                     <p>She therefore often treated both lord and lady Villars with a kind of civil inſolence; and very
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:036127_0162_10085040DC91FAE8"/>
openly aſſerted her right of having her own way in every thing. She did not want talents, nor diſcernment: and ſhe deſpiſed lady Villars as much for the narrowneſs of her underſtanding, as ſhe did lord Villars for the ſordidneſs of his views.</p>
                     <p>Lord Villars tolerated all this in conſideration of the number of her eſtates. But lady Villars ſoon conceived a decided diſlike to her, and a deep-rooted fear of her ever becoming the wife of her ſon. This diſlike and this fear were ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered more lively by the compariſon ſhe daily made between her character and that of Ellen.</p>
                     <p>But lord Villars' hopes and lady Villars' fears were alike unfounded; and were one proof more, added to the thouſands that occur every day, that, if the ſufferings of life were to be confined to actual misfortunes, the mountain of human woes, which now ſeems ſo immenſe, and extended, would ſhrink into a mole-hill, of a ſize ſo ſmall as almoſt to eſcape obſervation. It is, however, inſeparable from our nature, that our ſufferings ſhall be more from what we fear, than from what we feel: and in reckoning the ſorrows attached to our exiſtence here, we are to eſtimate not what is, but what it is apprehended may be.</p>
                     <p>Among the joyous circle that Ellen on her marriage had drawn round her at Oakley, her brother was not forgotten.</p>
                     <p>He had continued under the private tuition where mr. Mordaunt had placed him on his return from Jamaica, until of a ſufficient age to be ſent to college: and at eighteen he had been removed to Oxford.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt dreading the influence of his wife on the character of his ſon, had ſuffered him to ſpend as little time as poſſible at Groby Manor,
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:036127_0163_100850436F595680"/>
while he continued a ſchool boy; and after his removal to Oxford, had continued ſo to fill up his vacations with ſome pleaſurable ſcheme or other, as almoſt totally to baniſh him from thence, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any appearance of deſign or unkindneſs. But he was now grown to manhood: and precautions of this kind were no longer poſſible or neceſſary; nor could mr. Mordaunt any longer refuſe himſelf the ſatisfaction of aſſociating with his ſon, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially as he flattered himſelf, that his own opinions might probably now have more influence over him than thoſe of his mother.</p>
                     <p>William Mordaunt had now therefore joined the family party at Oakley. He was handſome, gay, and good-humoured: but he was wild, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiderate, and ungovernable.</p>
                     <p>Lady Almeria and he were drawn towards each other, by a ſympathy of character and diſpoſition. From the firſt hour of their acquaintance, they became inſeparable: and lord Villars ſaw that if he did not find ſome immediate remedy for this impending evil, lady Almeria's fortune would be loſt to his family for ever.</p>
                     <p>He had recourſe to his uſual means, delay.</p>
                     <p>He laid before lady Almeria the inequality and degradation of the connexion that ſhe ſeemed diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to form; and declared, that while ſhe was under his direction, neither his honour nor his conſcience would permit him to ſuffer it.</p>
                     <p>Lady Almeria liſtened in ſilence, and with an inſolent non-chalance, to his lecture: and when he had ended it, twiſting her ſaſh ribband round her arm, as ſhe went out of the room, replied between her teeth, "We muſt wait until I am one-and-twenty then."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="166" facs="unknown:036127_0164_10085046CFCEC0C0"/>If lady Almeria would but wait, it was all lord Villars could dare to hope from her: and from his own machinations during this period of expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, he was to look for what further was wanting, to his ſucceſs. From his uſual coad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jutrice, mrs. Mordaunt, he could not in this caſe expect any aſſiſtance; for however deſirous ſhe might be to promote the intereſts of her nephew, in general, when they came in competition with thoſe of her ſon, they could not be expected to have any but a ſecond place. She had ſeen the growing fondneſs between him and lady Almeria; and had ſecretly reſolved to do all in her power to forward it. It had been obſerved by mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt with very different wiſhes and views: but he wiſely thought a ſeeming inattention to what was going on, the moſt likely method of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting a fancy from growing into a prejudice: and he imagined, if his ſon were nor led by op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition into making engagements with himſelf, not to give up lady Almeria, that the preſent par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiality would probably end in a boy and girl's ſhort-lived flirtation, without any farther conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence.</p>
                     <p>But the precipitancy of lady Almeria's paſſions rendered the plans of hindrance on the part of lord Villars and mr. Mordaunt, and thoſe of aſſiſtance on the part of mrs. Mordaunt, equally vain and uſeleſs.</p>
                     <p>Lady Almeria had liſtened to lord Villars with the moſt apparent indifference: but this did not ariſe from her being careleſs as to his oppoſition to her deſigns, but from her reſolution, that all op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition from whatever quarter ſhould prove vain.</p>
                     <p>She went directly from lord Villars to William
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:036127_0165_1008504948834688"/>
Mordaunt. She found him practiſing archery with ſome of his companions.</p>
                     <p>"Come along with me," ſaid ſhe, "I have ſomething to ſay to you. Guardy," (for ſo ſhe was accuſtomed in contempt to call lord Villars) "Guardy," ſaid ſhe, when they were alone, "has been fulminating his interdict againſt my becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing your wife. Neither his honour nor his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, forſooth, can allow of ſo unequal a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection. That is, his honour deſigns to give my perſon to his ſon, who cares not a pin for me; and his conſcience appropriates my fortune as the proviſion for his younger children. But if I and my money are to go to ruin, they ſhall go my own way. He will not find me ſo ſoon moralized and ſentimentalized out of my rights as he found your ſiſter Ellen. What ſay you? Are you inclined to truſt my conſtancy through all the battleings and all the temptations with which it will be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaulted in the next four years? Or will you make ſhort work of it, and meet me with a chaiſe and four at the corner of the park wall, at one in the morning, and away to Scotland, and let guardy try, with all his bay and brown coach horſes, to overtake us?"</p>
                     <p>"To night! this moment! in the face of the ſun, in ſpite of all the guardians and all the coach horſes in the world."</p>
                     <p>"That would be ſpirited; but no. We ſhould have ſcolding, and hectoring, and locking up, and the lord knows what. I think I could be a match for them there too; but I hate unneceſſary trouble, and have no deſire to play the part of a diſtreſſed damſel. Let us do the matter quietly, at one, by the ſilent light of the moon. O lord, it does not ſhine: but no matter, the ſtars will do as well.
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:036127_0166_1008504BE67E7248"/>
I will be punctual to the minute. If you are out of caſh I can ſupply you. I received my quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terage two days ago, and having paid no bills, it is luckily entire."</p>
                     <p>"Well, be it ſo; at one exactly."</p>
                     <p>"To a ſecond. There's my hand upon it. And now let us go to our aunts, and our uncles, and our couſins, and our guardians, and behave prettily, as a good little maſter and miſs ought to do: and we may laugh at them the more when we are by ourſelves."</p>
                     <p>And thus, in leſs than ten minutes did theſe two thoughtleſs creatures determine upon a ſtep upon which all the happineſs or miſery of their future lives depended.</p>
                     <p>William found no difficulty in engaging a chaiſe and four to be at the appointed ſpot, at the hour fixed upon; nor lady Almeria any in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſing her maid before ſhe was undreſſed; nor, when ſhe was gone, in wrapping herſelf up in her furs, and, with a ſmall bundle of linen in her hand, deſcending the ſtairs, opening the door into the garden, or in proceeding from thence to the park, or, finally, in keeping her appointment with William.</p>
                     <p>At the corner of the park wall ſhe found him; he received her with all the gaiety of youth, and all the raptures of a lover; they put themſelves into the chaiſe together, and before lady Almeria was miſſed in the morning, had proceeded too far on their way to Scotland, to give any hopes of ſucceſs from a purſuit.</p>
                     <p>Whatever confuſion the diſcovery of their flight might occaſion in the family at Oakley, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever inward vexation it cauſed lord Villars, who thus ſaw a final end to all his ambitious projects,
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:036127_0167_1008504DA1B65F00"/>
yet the nearneſs of the connexion in all the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viduals who compoſed that family, prevented any violent diſplay of diſappointment or chagrin. Lord Villars thought proper to gloſs over the matter with an aſſurance, that although the reſpect he had for the truſt repoſed in him by lady Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria's father, would have prevented his conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſuch a match, yet the regard that he enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained for the intereſts of his nephew, made him, ſince it had been concluded without his concur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence, ſincerely rejoice in it.</p>
                     <p>With an air of acting under theſe feelings, he made, though ſomething with an ill grace, his congratulations to mr. Mordaunt: and mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt, with infinitely more ſincerity, aſſured him, that had the connexion depended upon him, it had never taken place: and indeed the deep ſigh, that the reflection upon the miſery that an ill-judged marriage can occaſion drew from him, evinced, that neither the ſplendour of lady Almeria's birth, or the greatneſs of her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, compenſated, in his opinion, for the light<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her mind and the unfeelingneſs of her heart.</p>
                     <p>The ſatisfaction, however, of mrs. Mordaunt, who judged very differently, knew no bounds: and lady Villars could not help joining (though from very different motives) in her pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>The fate of lord Villars upon this occaſion, was peculiarly hard. While half the world called his honeſty in queſtion, for having ſacrificed the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſts of his ward to thoſe of his nephew; the other half arraigned his prudence, in ſuffering ſuch a prize to go out of his own family; theſe cenſures were equally unfounded. He had ſpared
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:036127_0168_1008505041458020"/>
no pains to preſerve lady Almeria from his ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phew: he had left no art uneſſayed to ſecure her for his ſon.</p>
                     <p>This event affected Ellen very ſenſibly. She could not but be pleaſed that Henry was relieved from all perſecution on lady Almeria's account, and that he was ſafe from the poſſibility of yield<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to it. But the very unfavourable opinion ſhe had of lady Almeria's character, and which a farther knowledge of her had confirmed, filled her mind with the moſt lively apprehenſions for the happineſs of her brother.</p>
                     <p>The young couple, however, were welcomed on their return from Scotland, without much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach on any ſide. The neceſſary arrangements of their eſtabliſhment were made: and harmony ſeemed reſtored to all the parties concerned.</p>
                     <p>Another event, which happened in the family of Ellen, at this time, occaſioned much more ſerious conſternation and diſtreſs.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Mordaunt had long had the mortification of being witneſs to the miſery and poverty of her eldeſt daughter. No one reproached her as the cauſe <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> but, notwithſtanding her natural indif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to every ſorrow that did not attack her perſonally, ſhe could not avoid making herſelf the moſt ſevere reproaches. She now ſaw the fatal conſummation of her ill-laid plans of ambition and vanity. The miſerable daughter was returned upon their hands. The unprincipled man, whom ſhe had choſen for her huſband, having collected the remnants of his ruined fortune, had left his wife and two children to beggary, and had quitted England, as he ſaid, for ever.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt was little able to bear this
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:036127_0169_10085053B19B2860"/>
additional burden. There was however no al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative. His daughter and her children were ſtarving. Groby Manor was the only aſylum open to them: to Groby Manor, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, after a viſit of three months to Ellen, mr. Mordaunt conducted his wife and the reſt of his family.</p>

                     <p>ELLEN and ſir William were now left alone: and Ellen had leiſure to look around her and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider the duties and engagements which her new ſituation called her to the performance of.</p>
                     <p>In the ſcheme of happineſs, which, in conſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a marriage with ſir William Ackland, ſhe had planned for herſelf, a very prominent feature had been the regular and ſyſtematic aſſiſtance ſhe ſhould be able to adminiſter to the wants, both of mind and eſtate, of her poor neighbours. In the fullneſs of her benevolent ſelf-gratulation, ſhe had ſaid, "when the ear hears me, it ſhall bleſs me: when the eye ſees me, it ſhall give witneſs to me. The bleſſing of him who is ready to periſh, ſhall come upon me: and I will cauſe the widow's heart to ſing for joy."</p>
                     <p>In her imagination, ſhe educated the young, ſhe encouraged the middle-aged, and ſhe ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported the old. She ſaw the neat cottage ariſe at her command; the orderly arranged bee-hive reſt againſt the wall, a ſource at once of pleaſure and of profit; the little flower plat put forth its beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties; the orchard yield its fruits, and the virtues of integrity and induſtry <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <pb n="173" facs="unknown:036127_0171_1008505AADA3BF10"/>Such were the viſions that filled the mind of Ellen, who, wholly inſenſible to every happineſs ſhe could not communicate, thought ſhe placed her own felicity on the ſureſt baſis, when ſhe ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended it to others.</p>
                     <p>Such were the viſions which had filled the mind of Ellen before her marriage: and amidſt the hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried and buſy ſcenes which had held her almoſt wholly engaged in what appeared more perſonally to concern herſelf for the firſt three months after it took place, ſhe had by no means loſt ſight of them.</p>
                     <p>In all her excurſions in the environs of Oakley, ſhe had looked around her with reference to the favourite object that filled her mind. She had endeavoured to make ſome enquiry into the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation of the cottagers, and to form an acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the pooreſt of her neighbours. But ſhe found difficulties that had never occurred to her imagination.</p>
                     <p>The long reſidence of ſir William abroad, and the character of his immediate anceſtors, who had ſpent little of their time at their principal country reſidence, and who had beſtowed leſs of their thoughts upon the wants and claims of the poor who ſurrounded it, had long occaſioned Oakley to be forgotten by the diſeaſed and the neceſſitous; and had made its owners to be conſidered as hard and ſelfiſh people of faſhion, who regarded their eſtate no farther than as it could furniſh the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply to their pleaſures or their vices. There were no old ſervants to whom Ellen could apply for information, how to direct her benevolence. Her houſehold conſiſted of a ſet of domeſtics whom ſir William had collected upon his marriage, all
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:036127_0172_1008505C550ABBE8"/>
ſtrangers to that neighbourhood, and indifferent to its intereſts. The ſteward was a man whom ſir William had brought out of Wales, profeſſedly that he ſhould have no predilection for any of thoſe with whom he would have to deal. Sir William knew as little of the reſidents on his eſtate, as any of his dependants, farther than if they paid their rents well or ill: and whenever Ellen endeavoured to lead him to think upon the ſubject, or to open her own plans, he either re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed her by a look of diſapprobation, or laughed her out of countenance, on the taſte ſhe had of becoming a lady Bountiful.</p>
                     <p>Ellen willingly imputed this backwardneſs to what ſhe ſtill believed ſir William muſt think right, and would therefore in time purſue, to the contrary habits in which he had been ſo long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged, to the different ſolicitudes that at preſent occupied him, and to the novelty of a country life, and country cares. To her he was laviſh: and therefore ſhe could diſtribute her guineas around her to the relief of immediate and impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate diſtreſs: and with this ſhe endeavoured to reſt ſatisfied, until time would enable her to mature her plans of more permanent aſſiſtance; aſſiſtance that would equally relieve the diſtreſſes of indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, correct the errors of ignorance, and reclaim the wanderings of vice.</p>
                     <p>As ſir William and Ellen rode or walked out together, ſhe would aſk queſtions of the women or children that fell in her way, or would ſtop and enter any cottage, which either from its neatneſs or deſolation particularly drew her attention. But ſir William betrayed the greateſt impatience on her thus withdrawing her attentions one moment from him. He ſeemed enraptured to have her
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:036127_0173_1008506036644160"/>
left to himſelf, and as if he could not endure that even her duties ſhould ſhare her with him.</p>
                     <p>The perfect indifference, or marked diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation with which he heard her tales of diſtreſs, and her projects for relieving the ſufferers, awak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened Ellen to a moſt painful conviction, that ſhe muſt conſider herſelf as ſufficiently happy, if ſhe were allowed in ſilence and unobſerved, as it were, to purſue them: but that ſhe muſt not hope from ſir William either concurrence or applauſe.</p>
                     <p>Ellen here firſt taſted of thoſe waters of diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, which were afterwards to flow with ſo full a ſtream.</p>
                     <p>The affection ſhe entertained for ſir William was compoſed of confidence and benevolence; of a ſenſe of the virtues ſhe believed he poſſeſſed, and of the gratification that his manners and conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation afforded to her taſte. On this affection ſhe had boldly promiſed herſelf happineſs in her connexion with him, notwithſtanding the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided preference ſhe had formerly entertained for Henry. She looked around her; and ſaw a very ſufficient degree of happineſs attached to the ſtate of marriage, where the contracting parties were well known not to have united themſelves with the objects of their firſt affections: and ſhe reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly believed, that felicity depended much more upon the qualities of the huſband, than upon the accidental circumſtance of his having been the firſt perſon whoſe merit had made any impreſſion upon the heart of the wife. "Sir William is worthy, is pleaſing," ſaid Ellen; "and I ſhall be happy."</p>
                     <p>Nothing could have been more juſt than her concluſion, had her premiſes been firm. But if the virtues were to diſappear on which her confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:036127_0174_10085061C12EE6F8"/>
and her benevolence reſted, how inade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate to her happineſs would be that affection, which had nothing left for its ſupport but the external graces of manner and converſation.</p>
                     <p>Ellen ſoon found the whole ſcheme of her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs muſt be incomplete. But ſhe ſtill flattered herſelf (for ſhe was young, and had all that ſan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guineneſs of diſpoſition that accompanies the warmeſt philanthropy) ſhe ſtill flattered herſelf, that ſome parts were yet in her power.</p>
                     <p>She had promiſed herſelf, indeed, that ſir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam would go hand in hand with her in her vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues, as well as her pleaſures. But if ſhe could not accompliſh the firſt, ſhe yet did not deſpair of the ſecond; and was not without hope, that by this circuitous road, ſhe might at length lead him to the point ſhe wiſhed. She therefore eagerly concurred with him in a deſign he had formed, of building her a dairy houſe. But the oſtentation he diſplayed in his manner of doing it, and the parade he made of ſtudying her taſte, while he ſhewed the moſt unequivocal diſſatisfaction if that taſte differed in the ſmalleſt degree from his own, effectually ſickened poor Ellen of the dairy-houſe long before it was finiſhed; and ſhe never drank one bowl of cream within its walls, uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taminated by the effects of ſir William's ſelfiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, violence, or jealouſy.</p>
                     <p>Every day brought the diſappointed Ellen, freſh proofs of all thoſe failings in the mind of him whom ſhe had engaged to love and reſpect.</p>
                     <p>His expenſes flowed but in the ſingle channel of ſelf-gratification. They reached <hi>her</hi> indeed; becauſe to ornament and indulge her made at preſent a principal part of his gratification: but to have pleaſures, however innocent or praiſe-worthy,
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:036127_0175_100850634D3C7938"/>
which ſhe did not refer to him, ſhe ſoon diſcovered would be conſidered as a crime.</p>
                     <p>From the ſofteſt manners and moſt courtly ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs, ſhe frequently ſaw him, on the ſlighteſt provocation from a ſervant, become furious and abuſive: and ſhe could not conceal from herſelf, that in his dealings with his dependants, he was oppreſſive and tyrannical.</p>
                     <p>Ellen was the admiration and the love of the neighbourhood. Her youth and gaiety of diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition led her to participate in all the pleaſures which were offered her, and to promote them by every means in her power. Sir William ſoon taught her, for no one could be more quick in taking a hint, that ſuch gaiety and ſuch good neighbourhood were diſpleaſing to him: and Ellen quickly withdrew from her uſual parties.</p>
                     <p>To have made ſuch a ſacrifice to any reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able feeling in the breaſt of ſir William, would have coſt Ellen nothing. It was the conſciouſneſs that ſhe made it to the hydra-headed monſter, jealouſy, that gave it any ſting.</p>
                     <p>Of whom, it will be aſked, was ſir William jealous? Of every body, of every thing that con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributed to the pleaſures of Ellen, independent of his agency.</p>
                     <p>To all the unfavourable ſuſpicions relative to ſir William's heart, and temper, which had, in a vague and doubtful form, ariſen in her mind be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her marriage, the occurrences of every day now gave ſhape and ſtability: and Ellen had not been married ſix months, before ſhe found herſelf involved in the difficult taſk of keeping alive, by every artifice in her power, her affection for a man, who might, had he pleaſed, in half that time
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:036127_0176_10085065D0AEA528"/>
have ſecured her heart immovably his own for ever. But the efforts of ſir William ſeemed di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, if indeed they had any direction, rather to deſtroy than to excite or nouriſh love.</p>
                     <p>On the ſucceſsful cultivation of her affection for her huſband, Ellen knew that all her happineſs, and ſhe feared much of the performance of her duty, depended. She had, it is true, been only acquainted with diſappointment: and ſhe had proved herſelf equal to the ſevereſt ſelf-denial. But her ſorrows had then found the ſofteſt ſoother, and her virtuous reſignation the warmeſt pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyric, in the kindneſs and partiality of her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. In the bittereſt moments of her diſtreſs, in the moſt laborious of her ſtruggles, his ſympathy and his approbation had ſtilled the voice of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and ſmoothed the rugged road of virtue. In the trials which ſhe now foreſaw awaited her, ſhe could hope for no ſuch ſupport, for no ſuch encouragement. Her firſt duty was concealment. The moſt wilful blindneſs with reſpect to herſelf, and the moſt inviolable ſilence with reſpect to others, was the firſt, the indiſpenſable rule by which ſhe was henceforth to form her conduct.</p>
                     <p>But, feeling, how could ſhe perſuade herſelf ſhe did not feel? And, ſuffering, how could ſhe be ſilent? Diſappointed, how could ſhe put on the air of ſatisfaction? and loſing all on which ſhe could ground eſteem, how could ſhe preſerve love? Theſe were points of conſtant and painful doubt and deliberation. But more immediate evil preſſed upon her.</p>
                     <p>"Where ſhe could not love, ſhe could derive no ſatisfaction from being beloved. She felt that it was not the virtues of her heart, nor even the powers of her underſtanding, that made her ſo
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:036127_0177_1008506758731820"/>
much the object of paſſion to ſir William. She was thoroughly awakened to the conviction, that the ſolicitude which, in the early days of their acquaintance, he had diſcovered as to her real character, and upon which ſhe had afterwards reflected with ſo much ſatisfaction, as a proof that his affection for her was founded upon thoſe qualities, of which he would be the more aſſured, the more he knew her, was in fact nothing more than a ſelfiſh anxiety, leſt, in the apparently gentle and complacent virgin, he ſhould hereafter diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover the arrogant and ſelf-willed wife. In a regulated temper, he ſaw a ſecurity for his do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic peace. In ſoundneſs of principles he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>held the guarantee of his honour. And in his ſyſtematic ſearch for a wife, by whom to give an heir to his eſtate, he had, in reſpect to character, looked no farther.</p>
                     <p>In fixing upon Ellen, he had been determined, by finding reaſon to believe, that in ſweetneſs of temper, and in goodneſs of heart, ſhe yielded the palm to no one. He had warily decided to fix upon a wife before he was in love: and Ellen's perſon, which had at firſt appeared to him, rather ſimply pleaſing than beautiful, ſeemed calculated to gratify his eye, without intoxicating his ſenſes. But although Ellen did not ſeize the ſoul with the firſt glance, her's was even a more dangerous faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cination. The charms of her converſation, the graces of her manner, the winning ſincerity and modeſt frankneſs of her character, all conſpired to render her irreſiſtible, and to give her that power over the mind which beauty alone never beſtowed. Sir William had become madly in love: and no ſentiment in the breaſt of Ellen, not wholly correſpondent to that which he felt for
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:036127_0178_1008506CECD45950"/>
her, could ſatisfy his deſires, or lull his jealouſies to ſleep.</p>
                     <p>In the well governed mind of Ellen this was a paſſion that could find no admittance. No merit whatever could have excited it. How impoſſible, then, was it, that ſhe ſhould feel ſuch love for a man, who every day loſt ground in her eſteem, not only by his conduct towards others, but even towards herſelf!</p>
                     <p>Sir William, in having become a lover, had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained his dread of being made a dupe to the paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of love. Hence, even his fondneſs was cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious, and his indulgence tyrannical; and Ellen, who in marriage had ſought a friend, found by turns only a lover or a maſter.</p>

                     <p>IT was in making theſe mortifying diſcoveries that Ellen ſpent the firſt ſix months after her marriage.</p>
                     <p>Diſappointed in her ſchemes of benevolence, miſtaken in the character of her huſband, diſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied with herſelf, ſhe was ſometimes tempted to arraign her own conduct in having married ſir William. But this was an idea that her good ſenſe eaſily corrected.</p>
                     <p>Keeping faſt to principles, ſhe knew herſelf unaccountable for events. If ſhe had been miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, it was from no want of due conſideration, from no precipitancy of action, produced by im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proper motives. She reviewed her conduct; and found, that being placed again in the ſame cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, and aſſiſted by the ſame lights, ſhe ſhould again act the ſame part. This conviction ſomewhat calmed her mind. What appeared ſo reaſonable, ſhe was perſuaded muſt have a ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient portion of good in it, to ſatisfy a rational creature. She endeavoured to find out this good.</p>
                     <p>She conſidered that her's was no uncommon caſe; that marriage-diſcontent was a weed that found nouriſhment in every ſoil; that it ſprang up alike in the fields of love, and in the wilds of am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition and avarice; that no foreſight could ſtifle,
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:036127_0180_100850735320A6F8"/>
no prudence eradicate it. If her own marriage furniſhed an example that the cooleſt inveſtigation was not ſufficient to guard from the moſt fatal miſtakes in a matrimonial choice, her father's equally condemned the yielding to the blind im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſe of paſſion.</p>
                     <p>"There are evils," ſaid ſhe, "which no human foreſight can teach us to avert, which no purity of intention, can enable us to eſcape. In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct under ſuch evils lies our trial, and the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of our future reward or puniſhment.</p>
                     <p>This thought brought with it a train of the moſt anxious ſolicitudes. Ellen had all the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truſt of herſelf, which true humility and an earneſt deſire to do right, ever induces. To guard her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from that acute ſenſe of her ſorrow which might lead to faulty regrets, or culpable impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience, ſhe carefully avoided every exaggeration of her diſappointment which fancy could have ſuggeſted. She would not allow herſelf to think her's a peculiar misfortune, or attended with any particularly aggravating circumſtances. She re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed from her mind all anticipations, and all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troſpects. She made every hour bear its own burden, and, as much as in her power, was ready to accept the preſent good, without perverſely dwelling upon the paſt, or anxiouſly conjecturing the future.</p>
                     <p>If ſir William's ill humour, or his fondneſs, (for effects were often the ſame, when cauſes were different) put her out of her way of virtue or of, pleaſure, ſhe ſought ſome other path which might lead, though not ſo directly, to her point. His ill humour ſhe endeavoured to diſarm by com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaiſance, and by gaiety, and to meet his fondneſs with the genuine ſatisfaction of reciprocal love.
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:036127_0181_10085074DB5694B8"/>
But this was the moſt difficult part of her taſk. Could ſhe have eſteemed him, his harſhneſs and his unreaſonableneſs with reſpect to herſelf, ſhe could have more eaſily borne, and would hope to have ſubdued. But in loſing her eſteem for him, ſhe loſt this hope: and, in loſing this hope, ſhe loſt the power of returning his paſſion with any but diſſembled kindneſs.</p>
                     <p>Thus Ellen, with the moſt ſincere and upright of human hearts, ſaw herſelf obliged to cultivate hypocriſy as a virtue. But that which is a crime in others, was in her only a misfortune.</p>
                     <p>From a never-ceaſing ſucceſſion of diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and from the accumulated weight of dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficult duties, Ellen was ſomewhat relieved by her removal to town. The novelty of the ſcene, the gaiety of the amuſements, the objects of ſplendor and curioſity with which ſhe was ſurrounded, filled and amuſed her mind. Sir William, too, ſeemed to have left much of his ill humour and narrowneſs of heart in the country. The air of London appeared to be more congenial to his character, and to call forth all the amiable parts of it. His liberality and gaiety revived; his money flowed freely round him; his houſe was open to the beſt ſociety; his entertainments were elegant; and his eſtabliſhment ſplendid.</p>
                     <p>But the principle of all this was little ſuited to that on which Ellen acted, and on which ſhe wiſhed him to have acted. "This, this," would he ſay to her, "is life! I grudge every guinea I expend in the country. I hate that my money ſhould be ſwallowed in thick ale down the throats of ſtupid country oafs, or be waſted in courting a popularity, which is both the ruin and diſgrace of whoever enjoys it."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="184" facs="unknown:036127_0182_100850778798F240"/>"But in the improvement of the beauties of nature," ſaid Ellen, "or in the relief of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſes of ſickneſs, or age, money will not be miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>applied even in the country."</p>
                     <p>"What beauties of nature are comparable to thoſe diſplayed in Hyde Park, or Kenſington Gardens? And what diſtreſſes are thoſe that the poor laws do not amply provide for? There is no other country in Europe, where there is ſuch a proviſion made for the poor, by the laws, as in England: no country that can vie with it in public inſtitutions for the relief of all kinds of miſery. I approve all this: but having contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted my part to theſe inſtitutions, I have done enough; I have done what I can afford: and pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate charities, I am convinced, are only the nouriſhers of idleneſs and the dupes of impoſition."</p>
                     <p>Ellen did not preſs upon the ſubject: but ſhe could not but obſerve to herſelf, that the man who did not think two hundred pounds too much to expend in one evening's amuſement in London, could not, with much appearance of truth, ſay, he had done all he could afford towards relieving the diſtreſſes of his fellow creatures.</p>
                     <p>It was one of ſir William's favourite maxims, that money ſpent in luxury was of more uſe, than if given in charity: and he would point out to Ellen, with a triumphant air, the ſplendor and richneſs of the ſhops, and aſk her, if ſhe did not think that thoſe who contributed to the ſupport of them, were of infinitely more uſe to ſociety, than all the good houſewives and lady Bountifuls that ever were born.</p>
                     <p>Ellen was too wiſe to argue with ſelfiſhneſs and prejudice. "Could the whole world be a Lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don, my dear ſir William," ſhe would ſay, "your
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:036127_0183_1008507910F57DE0"/>
argument might be concluſive. But after doing all we can to the ſupport of theſe manufacturers of the luxuries of life, there will ſtill remain a large country world, who will periſh for the want of the neceſſaries of it, if thoſe of ſuperior fortunes do not ſometimes turn their thoughts from the ſhop to the cottage."</p>
                     <p>Theſe kind of converſations made their rambles through London but little pleaſing to Ellen: but ſhe ſeemed to follow ſir William's lead; took more than uſual care of the elegance of her appearance; cultivated her inclination for amuſement; and ſought, by every means in her power, to do ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to ſir William's taſte, and to ſupport her part in the ſociety he had introduced her to.</p>
                     <p>In the perpetual crowd in which ſhe lived, there ſeemed to be little probability ſhe ſhould make any ſelections that could alarm his jealouſy, or wound his ſelf-love. She had not time to know any one well enough to become attached to him. Her time and her thoughts were taken up by a perpetual ſucceſſion of engagements: but ſhe had too good health and ſpirits to be eaſily tired: and a perſon of Ellen's quickneſs of parts and cultivated underſtanding, found, even in the promiſcuous crowd of triflers and ſimpletons, many perſons from whom ſhe reaped both advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage and amuſement.</p>
                     <p>If Ellen's heart was heavy in ſcenes, where from her youth, her attractions, and the advantages with which ſhe appeared, ſhe ought to have felt only ſelf-gratulation and pleaſure; it was not from any retroſpect in which ſhe indulged herſelf, but from the immediate weight which the conviction of the real character of the man on whom ſhe was
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:036127_0184_1008507A97F70668"/>
to depend for happineſs, and with whom ſhe was to paſs her life, had fixed there. To love thoſe with whom ſhe was intimately connected, was indiſpenſible to the felicity of Ellen. This the character of ſir William made impoſſible: and hence Ellen, with every other bleſſing which hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man beings implore, was wretched.</p>
                     <p>But Ellen was not wretched alone. Neither the hopeleſs ſtate to which he was reduced, nor the fortitude he had exerted, had been able to reſtore to Henry his peace of mind. The mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage of lady Almeria had been a momentary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief to him: but like the remiſſion of a fever, the diſorder ſeemed to have gained ſtrength by its temporary ſuſpenſion. Had Ellen been unmar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and the obſtacle of lady Almeria removed, (the thought pierced him with ten thouſand ſtings) another lady Almeria would have been found, replied his reaſon: Lady Almeria was not ſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolutely choſen as Ellen rejected.</p>
                     <p>"Be it as it may," ſaid he to himſelf, "the die is caſt; my fate is determined. I will follow the track I have chalked out for myſelf."</p>
                     <p>In purſuance of this reſolution he had viſited his family. He had been kindly received. He had endeavoured to rejoice in the kindneſs, and to buſy himſelf in the intereſts of thoſe around him. But the character of Henry was gone. His gaiety, his impetuoſity, his ſocial humour, his openneſs of heart were no more. An invincible gravity had taken their place, and a cold reſerve to all, with a chilling indifference to every thing around him, marked all his actions. He rather appeared, however, to have loſt the reliſh for pleaſure, than to ſhun it. He affected nothing: but from the
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:036127_0185_10085082A21B1058"/>
genuine overflowing ſorrows of his heart, he was incapable of taking intereſt in any thing. There were times, when he felt aſhamed of being thus overcome with his feelings: and then he made ſome more vigorous efforts to recover the natural tone of his mind. He imagined he ſhould be more likely to do ſo, were he again to ſee, and accuſtom himſelf to the preſence of Ellen.</p>
                     <p>"Henceforward," ſaid he to himſelf, "ſhe is to be nothing to me but the highly cheriſhed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of an invaluable bleſſing loſt for ever. Let me familiarize myſelf to that dear picture. It may be a means of rendering the ſenſe of my loſs leſs bitter."</p>
                     <p>Under the influence of theſe thoughts he came to town. It was eaſy for him to ſee Ellen every day without being obſerved by her: and when he had ſubdued the at firſt ungovernable tumults which the ſight of her for the ſeveral firſt times had occaſioned, he reſolved to preſent himſelf before her. He remembered the laſt words he had ever heard her utter, "I am going no where, but where if you pleaſe you may accompany me." I may ſee her ſtill, thought he. As a friend I may ſee her. And the friendſhip of Ellen is worth the love of all her ſex beſide.</p>
                     <p>One evening as Ellen was coming out of her box at the opera, accompanied by lady Almeria Henry appeared at the door.</p>
                     <p>"See, ſir Doleful Diſmal!" ſaid lady Almeria. "Do you know you have quite ſpoilt that man?"</p>
                     <p>Ellen involuntarily ſtopped. She could not for an inſtant move on. But Henry, who had been learning his leſſon, approached her. He had ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the air of a perſon who was accuſtomed to ſee her every evening, than of a lover, who now,
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:036127_0186_100850842BBE3A18"/>
for the firſt time after their ſeparation, beheld the beloved object which fate had torn from his arms, without being able to diſlodge her from his heart.</p>
                     <p>He enquired after her health. He aſked how ſhe liked the opera. He deſired to know if he could be of any uſe. And all this before Ellen, aſtoniſhed and pained by the profound gravity and coldneſs of his manner, had ſufficient preſence of mind to utter a word.</p>
                     <p>"How you two look!" ſaid lady Almeria laughing. "Dear, ſhe's very well. She has been enchanted with the opera: and if you will ſee for her carriage, you'll do us a favour."</p>
                     <p>Henry diſappeared like an arrow out of a bow. In ſpite of all his preparation, the ſcene was too much for him; nor could he have borne it a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment longer.</p>
                     <p>"How very ill mr. Villars looks!" ſaid Ellen, endeavouring to recover herſelf.</p>
                     <p>"And how very ill lady Ackland looks!" re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned the unmerciful lady Almeria. "Here, child, take my ſalts. If thoſe impertinents were to come by juſt now, who were diſputing the other night whether you wore rouge, the wager would be decided in a minute."</p>
                     <p>"How you rattle! I want no ſalts."</p>
                     <p>"No to be ſure. Well don't be afraid! I won't tell the old gentleman at home."</p>
                     <p>"I muſt beg, lady Almeria," ſaid Ellen, ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly, "that you will not ſpeak ſo. You know I will not ſuffer it."</p>
                     <p>"Well, then, I will tell him. Will that pleaſe you? There's no knowing how to deal with you ſentimental people."</p>
                     <p>Juſt then ſome gentlemen of their acquaintance
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:036127_0187_10085085B2ED52B0"/>
inquired whether they would call their ſervants. Ellen thankfully accepted the offer: but lady Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria ſaid, 'How can you be ſo rude? don't you know poor ſir Doleful is gone on the ſame er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rand? he'll be in deſpair, if you run away with out ſeeing him!'</p>
                     <p>Henry at that moment returned; and ſaying the coach was then at the door, took Ellen's hand to lead her to it. It was with ſome difficulty he got her through the crowd: and the embarraſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments they were in from that circumſtance, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved them both from the greater embarraſſments of their own minds.</p>
                     <p>As he put her into the coach, "May I viſit you?" ſaid he, "and will you introduce me to ſir William?"</p>
                     <p>"Undoubtedly, with the greateſt pleaſure," ſaid ſhe. It was all ſhe could ſay; for lady Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria followed her: and the coach drove off.</p>

                     <p>LADY ALMERIA accompanied Ellen home, nor did ſhe ſpare her raillery. They were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged to meet a party at ſupper; but as it was ſomewhat early, nobody happened to be arrived: and they therefore found ſir William, who was juſt returned from his dinner ſociety, alone.</p>
                     <p>Ellen would have choſen not to have men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned Henry's name before lady Almeria: but as ſhe was confident it would come out in the courſe of the evening, that ſhe had met with him, ſhe thought it moſt prudent to ſpeak, with all the indifference ſhe could aſſume, of the circumſtance herſelf.</p>
                     <p>"I have ſeen mr. Villars," ſaid ſhe to ſir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam: "and he has deſired me to introduce him to you."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! I wiſh you had ſeen them both," cried lady Almeria, "one ſo grave, the other ſo pale. Bow goes his worſhip; courtſey goes her ladyſhip. You would have ſworn they had not ſeen each other for three hundred years, and were not over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyed at the meeting now. Well, I proteſt I don't wonder Ellen choſe you, if ſhe could have any notion what kind of man Henry would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come; for I proteſt I think you ten times the more agreeable perſon, I vow."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="191" facs="unknown:036127_0189_1008508B8F2AF328"/>"Did you ſay you would introduce mr. Villars to me?" aſked ſir William very gravely, without regarding lady Almeria.</p>
                     <p>"I did," ſaid Ellen.</p>
                     <p>"Why, can you have any objection!" ſaid lady Almeria. "Ellen you know jilted him for you."</p>
                     <p>"What nonſenſe you talk, lady Almeria!" ſaid Ellen.</p>
                     <p>"She certainly does not talk truth," ſaid ſir William, with the ſame gravity as before. And here, much to the relief of Ellen, they were joined by more company: and the evening paſſed as uſual.</p>
                     <p>When they retired to their own apartments, Ellen remarked a gloom upon ſir William's coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance, which ſhe had never before obſerved ſince their arrival in London. She endeavoured to diſſipate it by more than uſual cheerfulneſs on her part: but he ſeemed to regard her with an eye of ſuſpicion, and preſerved a gloomy ſilence. Ellen heſitated whether ſhe ſhould ſeem to remark this change in his humour, and endeavour to regain his confidence, and diſſipate his chagrin, by ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit declarations of unalterable attachment.</p>
                     <p>But the caſe between them was much changed, from what it had been at the period when ſhe had laſt ſeen Henry, and when ſhe had held this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct with advantage. Sir William at that mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nt poſſeſſed her eſteem and warmeſt friendſhip. Now he had nearly loſt both one and the other. With truth could ſhe have promiſed inviolable conſtancy: but to ſpeak of an unſhaken attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment which no longer ſubſiſted, ſeemed adding hypocriſy to unkindneſs. The profeſſions ſhe had formerly made him, had flowed freely from her
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:036127_0190_1008508F5F66ECD8"/>
heart: now they would be uttered with embar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raſſment and coldneſs. The fears which then ſeemed to oppreſs him, ſhe had regarded with compaſſion. The ſuſpicions that he now evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently entertained, ſhe conſidered as injurious. They appeared but new marks of that narrow and ſelfiſh mind, the effects of which ſhe had every day reaſon to deplore.</p>
                     <p>The debate whether ſhe ſhould conquer ſuch feelings, or yield to them, held her ſo long, that before ſhe was aware, her ſilence was as marked as ſir William's: and they both retired to reſt, with equal diſinclination to ſleep.</p>
                     <p>Some few hours of uneaſy thought reſtored to Ellen her uſual calm of mind.</p>
                     <p>However oppreſſed her heart might feel, by the afflictive change that appeared to be wrought in the character of Henry—and however alarmed, and ſomewhat offended ſhe might be by the ſuſpicions to which ſhe was aware ſir William had yielded—yet her confidence, that her conduct would never juſtify the one, and her hope that time might bring ſome alleviation to the other, enabled her wholly to ſuppreſs her reſentment, and ſo far to overcome her ſorrow, as to baniſh from her countenance and manner every appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of it. In the courſe of her reflections ſhe had alſo made ſome which had ſoftened her heart toward ſir William.</p>
                     <p>Oh! thought ſhe, that he would but let me love him! The heart that can form ſuch a wiſh, is not far from its gratification: and it was with un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>affected tenderneſs, that Ellen propoſed to ſir William to paſs the morning in an excurſion ſome miles out of town, which he had talked of a few days before. But ſir William coldly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulſed
<pb n="193" facs="unknown:036127_0191_10085090E6B35170"/>
her by an air of ſcornful indifference, and by ſaying he had engagements elſewhere.</p>
                     <p>Elſewhere he went: for he quitted Ellen the moment breakfaſt was over: and ſhe ſaw him no more in the courſe of the morning.</p>
                     <p>Ellen had previouſly dedicated this morning to ſome home occupations: but the tumult of mind ſir William's unkind behaviour occaſioned, with the train of dangerous reflections it drew after it, made her afraid to truſt herſelf with her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf for a whole morning. The moment, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that ſhe could compoſe herſelf, after his departure, ſhe ordered her carriage, and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued to find occupation from home 'till a late hour.</p>
                     <p>On her return, the firſt card ſhe ſaw was that of mr. Villars: but ſhe had little time to think of this circumſtance, when ſhe found to her ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſe, that ſir William was not returned home.</p>
                     <p>They were engaged to dine at her brother's: but Ellen having waited in vain beyond all dinner time, for the return of ſir William, ſhe found herſelf ſo inexpreſſibly uneaſy, that ſhe was in no condition to keep her engagement. She therefore excuſed herſelf on the ſcore of indiſpoſition: and with a heart oppreſſed by fears and apprehenſions, to which ſhe ſcarcely dared to give a name, ſhe awaited with a degree of excruciating impatience, which ſhe had never before felt, the return of ſir William.</p>
                     <p>The clock had ſtruck nine when ſhe heard his knock at the door. She ran to the top of the ſtairs to meet him, and catching hold of his hand, "How glad I am to ſee you! where, where have you been?"</p>
                     <p>"I have been at your brother's," ſaid he
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:036127_0192_10085093E1A0FA70"/>
coldly. "But I could not ſtay when I heard you were ill. Are you better?"</p>
                     <p>"But where were you all this morning? Why did you not come home to dreſs?"</p>
                     <p>"I was kept late in the city. I knew your brother would excuſe me. But what's the matter? What kept you away?"</p>
                     <p>While Ellen detailed her fears, and her unea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, ſir William regarded her with an air as if he doubted the truth of what ſhe ſaid.</p>
                     <p>"I thought," returned he, "you had been above the fooliſh fears of your ſex. It is a pity you gave way to them in this inſtance. You have miſſed ſeeing an old friend. Mr. Villars was at your brother's."</p>
                     <p>The inſulting unkindneſs of theſe words filled Ellen's eyes with tears.</p>
                     <p>"No, ſir William," ſaid ſhe, "I have miſſed nothing that I regret on that account, I aſſure you. I ſee how your ſuſpicions wrong me. But, receive my ſolemn promiſe, that as far as it depends upon me, I have ſeen mr. Villars for the laſt time."</p>
                     <p>"No romantic reſolutions, I beg. Let me not be made ridiculous by your high-flown virtue. If mr. Villars be as indifferent to you as he ought to be, and as you have pretended, why ſhould he not viſit at my houſe like any other perſon of your or my acquaintance?"</p>
                     <p>"I might have aſked you that queſtion; for the objection ſeemed to come from you."</p>
                     <p>"And you did not know mr. Villars was to be at your brother's to-day? And you did not ſtay away on that account?"</p>
                     <p>"No, upon my honour. I ſtayed away for the reaſons I have given you."</p>
                     <p>"Then I aſk your pardon. I have been too
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:036127_0193_10085097DE321658"/>
haſty in my concluſions perhaps. Mr. Villars is now my acquaintance. You will conſider him henceforward as ſuch. And if you would have me believe that you regard him in no other light, you will make him as much and neither more nor leſs of your parties than you do any other perſon, who has the ſame claim to your attentions."</p>
                     <p>This was almoſt too much for Ellen. But ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duing every reſentment, and every tender feeling, ſhe ſaid, "I will do in this, and all other things, as nearly what you wiſh as I can; and where I fail, I hope your candour and your love will be heard in my excuſe."</p>
                     <p>"Oh! Ellen," ſaid ſir William, graſping her hand, "could you but love me as I have loved you!—But I am a fool to expect it. I make my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ridiculous. I'll change my dreſs and we'll go together to mr. Curzon's; and then let this non<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſe be forgotten."</p>
                     <p>"Oh!" cried Ellen to herſelf, with a deep ſigh, as he left the room, "how impoſſible it is to love this man!"</p>
                     <p>At mr. Curzon's they met lady Almeria.</p>
                     <p>"So, ſo, you are not ſick after all," ſaid ſhe. "I never thought you were. I'll lay my life you were afraid of meeting your old lover."</p>
                     <p>Ellen would have explained how the unac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>countable abſence of ſir William had alarmed her.</p>
                     <p>"Yes, yes, very likely. I don't believe a word of it though. But come, if you are not really afraid, ſhew it now, for there he is. In ſpite of his grave face, I would bring him with me. Thank my ſtars, Mordaunt is not jealous."</p>
                     <p>Although all this was not profeſſedly ſaid in the hearing of ſir William, yet was he ſo near that he loſt not a word of it. He now walked on: and
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:036127_0194_1008509966CAFC08"/>
lady Almeria ſaid, "I was running away; for the place is as dull as a quaker's meeting. I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not get a party at caſſino, but with old dowagers, the very ſight of whom gives me the vapours. But now you are come I ſhall have a little chat: or, come, let us ſit down to caſſino, and mr. Vil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars ſhall be of our party; though he is almoſt as bad as an old dowager too. But perhaps your preſence will enliven him."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Villars then came up; and with great gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity, hoped Ellen was better.</p>
                     <p>"Bleſs me, ſhe was never ill!" ſaid the ever talking lady Almeria. "I told you ſo all along."</p>
                     <p>"I hope mr. Villars will, in this caſe, rather believe me than you," ſaid Ellen with a ſmile. "But I am now quite well."</p>
                     <p>"This was the firſt time that Ellen had ever called Henry mr. Villars, when ſpeaking to him. The word ran through his veins like ice.</p>
                     <p>"Lady Almeria is ſo good as to anſwer for every body," ſaid he, faintly ſmiling. "It is no wonder that with ſo much buſineſs upon her hands, ſhe is not always quite accurate."</p>
                     <p>"I ſee you improve," returned ſhe. "I have not heard you attempt being ſaucy this age. But you muſt play at caſſino with us. I have been doing nothing 'till I am tired to death."</p>
                     <p>"Let ſir William make a fourth," ſaid Ellen.</p>
                     <p>"No, indeed," returned lady Almeria ſharply. "I have had a doſe of ſir William to-day, I can tell you. He really grows intolerable."</p>
                     <p>"I hope you intend I ſhould love you better for ſuch freedoms," ſaid Ellen.</p>
                     <p>"You'll not love me the worſe. Beſides, <hi>I may</hi> ſpeak what I think, whatever <hi>you may</hi> do."</p>
                     <p>"I have not quite loſt that privilege," returned
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:036127_0195_1008509C3210BDF0"/>
Ellen: "and I tell you plainly that if you mean I ſhould be of your caſſino party, you muſt be a little more agreeable."</p>
                     <p>"Agreeable! I'll be as agreeable as an angel. And ſo do go, that's a good ſoul, (ſpeaking to Henry) and find us a fourth—but not ſir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam."</p>
                     <p>However Henry might take moſt of theſe inſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuations, for lady Almeria's accuſtomed rattle, he could not but obſerve the ſhade of chagrin and melancholy that ruſhed on Ellen's brow: and he obſerved it with an anxious curioſity to know the real cauſe. He returned in a moment, bringing ſir William with him.</p>
                     <p>"See, I have obeyed you," ſaid he to lady Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria.</p>
                     <p>"Obeyed me? No: I proteſt againſt playing with huſbands and wives. Sir William, you are the only man in the room I objected to."</p>
                     <p>"I muſt hope, then," ſaid he with a laugh, "that you are the only lady in the room that <hi>would</hi> have made the objection. And even that ſtretch of vanity won't conſole me under the miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortune of your diſpleaſure."</p>
                     <p>"Oh, I did not object to you poſitively—only relatively, in your capacity of huſband."</p>
                     <p>"There may be ſomething flattering in that objection," returned he. "And now let you and me try to beat lady Ackland and mr. Villars."</p>
                     <p>This little party at cards diffuſed ſomething like eaſe among Henry, Ellen, and ſir William, in its conſequence; though it was little ſhort of mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrdom at the time: and from this night Henry viſited and was received at ſir William's houſe on the footing of a common acquaintance.</p>

                     <p>AS Ellen and Henry now ſaw each other, almoſt every day, the emotion with which they at firſt met, wore off by degrees. But Henry loſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of his gravity: and he could not but perceive that it ſeemed in ſome degree contagious.</p>
                     <p>Ellen's both natural and aſſumed ſpirits too often ſunk under the weight of every day's vexa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions which ſhe received from ſir William: But Henry, who knew nothing of all this, fluc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated between hope and fear, that the penſive thoughtfulneſs which ſometimes overſpread her countenance, might be imputable to the recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection of paſt ſcenes. He wiſhed her happy. He wiſhed her upright. But he knew not how to wiſh her wholly forgetful of his former ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings, or wholly inſenſible to his preſent. No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, however, aroſe, that could lead to the clearing his doubts. Ellen did not appear to ſhun, or to ſeek his company. She converſed with him with her uſual frankneſs; treated him as her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation and friend; but ſeemed to have, forgotten he had ever been her lover. Yet he often ſaw

                     <p>He turned his attentions toward <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> William; but could ſee nothing in his conduct which could give him reaſon to ſuppoſe the ſource of her un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs lay there. Sir William was in fact an impenetrable man. He knew how to conceal from the whole world his real diſpoſition: and he had beſides habitually different manners, and a different countenance, for his public and private hours.</p>
                     <p>He dreaded to draw on himſelf the ridicule which is attached to the character of a jealous huſband: and he wiſhed his acquaintance, eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially thoſe of his own ſtanding in life, to believe him perfectly ſatisfied in his choice of a wife.</p>
                     <p>The fangs of jealouſy, however, ſtruck deeper and deeper into his heart every day. The more he knew of Henry, the more he knew him to be the man moſt ſuited to the ſentiments and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of Ellen. In accidental converſations, he was frequently ſtruck by the coincidence of their opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions. Their minds ſeemed to be formed in the ſame mould; their hearts to beat in uniſon; their wiſhes, their pleaſures, their purſuits to be the ſame. The ſimilarity of their taſte, and of their virtues, ſeemed to form them for each other: and he knew not how to truſt, that the latter would be ſuch a barrier between them, as the former would not ſurmount. Yet could not the keen eye of jealouſy diſcover in the conduct of either any thing to reprove.</p>
                     <p>All was open, frank, and above board. He could not obſerve that Henry ſought Ellen apart from him, or from the reſt of the world: no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> could he diſcover in Ellen any affectation of too
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:036127_0198_100850A3CE5CA2C0"/>
much or too little ſolicitude in her intercourſe with Henry. But he ſuſpected that he himſelf loſt ground daily in the eſteem of Ellen; for he knew that he deſerved to do ſo: and he believed it not in nature that Ellen not loving him, ſhould forget that ſhe had loved Henry—Henry, too, ſo deſerving of her love! ſo conſonant to her taſte! ſo apparently, ſo almoſt avowedly conſidering her as the firſt of women! He could not have been more perfectly convinced of their mutual intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence, had he received the moſt unequivocal proofs of it.</p>
                     <p>Hence his private hours with Ellen were ſpent in indirect upbraidings, in cruel inſinuations, in direct charges of want of love on her part, which ſuch conduct ſerved completely to verify.</p>
                     <p>Ellen oppoſed to all this injuſtice the calmneſs which good ſenſe dictates, and the gentleneſs which a regulated mind inſpires. She treated ſir William's unkindneſs as the effect of a diſtemper: and ſhe thought ſhe ſaw no cure for it, but in the moſt undiſguiſed frankneſs.</p>
                     <p>"You have conceived the moſt diſtreſſing ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions," would ſhe ſay to him: "and the misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune is the greater, ſince, being totally unfounded, I know not how to clear myſelf from them. If you would preſerve any of that love in my breaſt, of the diminution of which you ſo bitterly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, you muſt give it ſomething whereon to feed. Complaints, reproaches, and calumnies, were never the ſuſtenance of affection. Take me where you will. I am ready to accompany you to the remoteſt corner of the world: there I will live only with you and for you. Fix upon any plan of life, where, though excluded from the ſociety and pleaſures of it, you admit of its duties,
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:036127_0199_100850A6E710E290"/>
and you will find me ever ready to concur. But let us not continue amid ſcenes of imagined amuſement and real miſery, where it is impoſſible but the very conduct you enjoin me, ſhould fill your heart with bitterneſs, and increaſe an evil which can only be cured by the reflections which time and a continued obſervation on my real cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter will enable you to make."</p>
                     <p>This was good advice. But it was the advice of cool reaſon, not the fervent expoſtulations of ardent love, ſuffering under the miſery of ſuſpicion. Sir William therefore rather reſented than bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fited by it.</p>
                     <p>Retirement, too, was by no means to his taſte. He could not have been happy, even in the love of Ellen, if he muſt only have enjoyed that love in a deſert. The world was the theatre on which his talents and his accompliſhments were ſhewn to moſt advantage. In the ſociety of men of genius, in the aſſemblies of people of high rank, in the circle of courts, ſir William had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to be liſtened to, and admired. And it was in ſcenes ſuch as theſe that he could alone find happineſs. Could Ellen have accompanied him in them, and could he have been convinced that ſhe preferred him to every other man ſhe met there, his happineſs would have been com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete. But in a ſolitude the gratification of his vanity was wanting to his felicity; and in the world, the gratification of his love. Poſſeſſed, however, with the opinion, that Ellen's heart was wholly given up to Henry, he no longer felt any pangs from jealouſy, of which he was not the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject: and in removing her from him he removed her from all whoſe attention towards her, gave
<pb n="202" facs="unknown:036127_0200_1008519ABB3804D8"/>
him uneaſineſs. Yet to ſecure his own honour in the preſervation of her's, was more a point of delicacy than a cure for the wounds of his mind. Once convinced that ſhe had ſacrificed it to her paſſion for Henry, and he would have found, if not a compenſation, at leaſt a gratification in the ſecurity of the puniſhment he meditated. But for the pangs inflicted by a perſuaſion that he had irrecoverably loſt her affection, no diſtance which he could place between her and Henry, no ven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geance which he could purſue, no indemnification he could propoſe to himſelf, could heal his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows, or reſtore him to peace. Solitude he would have thought rather favourable than diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous to the ſentiments he believed ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained: and therefore both to occupy her mind with ſcenes in which Henry had no ſhare, as well as to gratify his own taſte, they removed, on leav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing town, to Weymouth.</p>
                     <p>Ellen, the unhappy victim of this mixture of ſelfiſhneſs and vanity, had flattered herſelf that ſhe ſhould either have been permitted to viſit Groby Manor, or to return to Oakley. But ſir William ſeemed to have an almoſt equal averſion to both places.</p>
                     <p>The benevolent expenſes of Ellen, at Oakley, which he had no inclination to join in, or deſire to countenance, he felt as a reproach to him: and the ſcenes of Groby Manor he conſidered as too cloſely connected with the memory of Henry, to be favourable to his intereſt.</p>
                     <p>Ellen quitted town without regret: but ſhe did not go to Weymouth without reluctance. The little lightneſs of heart which ſhe had carried with her to London, had long ſince been loſt in the increaſing unkindneſs, of ſir William. The
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:036127_0201_10083878947FCD80"/>
amuſements it afforded had loſt their novelty, and with their novelty, to a mind ſo ill at eaſe as her's, their power of intereſting. But the duties and pleaſures of a country life ſhe knew were ſo ſuited to her taſte, as always to afford employment for her faculties and gratification to her heart. She had loſt the hope of being able to love ſir William, or of awakening in ſo irrational and ſo ſelfiſh a mind as his, that ſpirit of juſtice, from which, even while he continued to love her, ſhe could alone hope for any degree of happineſs; and ſometimes extending her views into a futurity when probably he would love her no more, ſhe trembled for the ſituation in which ſhe might find herſelf.</p>
                     <p>But Ellen's good ſenſe forbade her to torment herſelf with the apprehenſion of any probable evils: and ſhe was more willing to encourage the hope, that if ſhe might be allowed to take up her abode at Oakley, whether ſir William choſe to be with her or not, ſhe might always be able to ſecure to herſelf a very competent ſhare of content, in the active diſcharge of her duties. At preſent ſhe was however compelled to give up all thoughts of the quiet and intereſting occupations of the country; and to prepare herſelf for all the fatiguing diſſipation, and ſickening repetition, of a ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bathing place.</p>
                     <p>Ellen had only been a very ſhort time at Wey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mouth, before ſhe had reaſon to ſuppoſe herſelf in a ſituation which ſhe believed would give the greateſt pleaſure to ſir William.</p>
                     <p>During the firſt months of their marriage, he had expreſſed an anxious impatience for the proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect of becoming a father, and had more than once teſtified chagrin and diſappointment, when
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:036127_0202_10083880B6734138"/>
there were no appearances of his ſoon being one. Ellen herſelf anticipated a thouſand delightful cares and pleaſures which would ariſe from the duties of a mother; and was not ſhy of owning to ſir William, that the indiſpoſition under which ſhe then ſuffered, would probably put him in poſſeſſion of his wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>But this information, far from being received by ſir William with pleaſure, ſeemed to overwhelm him with the ſenſe of ſome ſudden misfortune. His countenance changed: his lips quivered with ſuppreſſed emotion: and he had hardly ſufficient command of himſelf to utter a word of kindneſs or congratulation on the ſubject.</p>
                     <p>All this was a perfect enigma to Ellen.— Happily in this inſtance her innocence defeated her penetration: and after much uneaſy conjecture, ſhe reſted upon the ſuppoſition, (a ſuppoſition ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficiently painful) that ſir William having loſt all love for her, had with it loſt all deſire of any far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther tie between them. She was confirmed in this idea, when ſhe obſerved, that he rather en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged than reſtrained her in riding, walking, and dancing. But Ellen, who began to ſee that all the felicity of her future life might probably depend upon children, became extremely ſolicitous not to loſe, by any indiſcretion of her own, her preſent promiſe of ſuch a ſource of happineſs.</p>
                     <p>Sir William, without ſeeming to advert to the care ſhe was willing to take of herſelf, was always projecting ſome party of amuſement; ſome riding, fiſhing, or frolicking expedition, which called for exertion of bodily ſtrength. Ellen had very good health; and knew not how to hold herſelf ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed from ſuch engagements, without ſeeming to take a ſuperſluous and ſelfiſh care of an
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:036127_0203_100850A86EC09CD8"/>
intereſt which nobody elſe appeared to think about.</p>
                     <p>Having ſpent two months at Weymouth, ſir William formed a party with another family to travel through South and North Wales, to croſs the kingdom from Cheſter to Scarborough, and fully to occupy the time until Chriſtmas, when they were engaged to ſpend a month with mr. Mordaunt and lady Almeria, at their houſe in Devonſhire.</p>
                     <p>Ellen ventured to plead for a little reſt, and mentioned Oakley. But ſir William told her, that travelling would do her good, and that he had planned the whole ſcheme entirely on her account.</p>
                     <p>She was leſs diſinclined to give into it, from the hopes that when they were ſo far North as Scar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borough, ſhe ſhould be able to perſuade ſir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam to make a viſit to Groby Manor. She com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated this hope to her father: and in this hope ſhe performed her peregrination through Wales, with much ſatisfaction. But by the time they arrived at Scarborough, ſir William declared the ſeaſon ſo far advanced, that no conſideration would induce him to venture a mile farther North: and under this pretence, he hurried her by haſty journies into Berkſhire.</p>
                     <p>Ellen happily ſuffered little by all theſe jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neyings. But when ſhe found herſelf once again at Oakley, ſhe would have been very happy, if ſhe might have remained there for ſome time. Sir William, however, declared himſelf impatient to join the ſociety at Stanton Park; and to Stanton Park they accordingly went.</p>
                     <p>Lady Almeria had filled her houſe with a nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous party of young diſſipated people of faſhion.
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:036127_0204_100850AC647129A0"/>
Hunting, riding, ſhooting, billiards, and ſhuttle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cock, engaged the mornings. The pleaſures of an expenſive table, high play, muſic and dancing, occupied the evenings. Here appeared love in all its degrees, from the ſerious, ſighing, jealous ſwain, to the pert fluttering coquet, who laughed at the paſſion ſhe affected to feel.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Mordaunt and lady Almeria had long ceaſed to affect even the ſemblance of a paſſion which had carried them ſo precipitately into Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land together: but in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aving ceaſed to contribute to each other's pleaſures, they had but fallen into a contrary extreme of wiſhing to interrupt them. He was careleſs, ſhe indifferent. He coquetted with every pretty woman who would liſten to him: and ſhe flirted with all the agreeable men who came in her way.</p>
                     <p>She had juſt lain in of a poor neglected little girl, who, confined to the nurſery, was ſeldom viſited by her mother. In ſcenes ſuch as theſe, where Ellen found ſo much to diſapprove, and ſo much to lament, this nurſery ſeemed her beſt refuge: and here ſhe ſpent many hours every day.</p>
                     <p>Sir William, ſince their abode at Weymouth, ſeemed to have loſt much of his former paſſion for Ellen: yet he could not ſee her, in ſuch a circle as that with which ſhe was now ſurrounded, without feeling her ſuperiority. He did feel it. His love ſeemed to revive: and he often ſought her in this ſame nurſery, where ſhe paſſed ſo much of her time.</p>
                     <p>Ellen, who never loſt ſight of the virtuous deſire of being one day able to inſpire ſir William with ſuch a way of thinking as would excite and retain her affection, felt her hopes of the approach of ſo deſirable a period ſpring anew, whenever do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtic
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:036127_0205_100850AEED3E7D30"/>
pleaſures, or domeſtic virtues appeared to engage his attention, or occupy his heart. She was delighted to ſee him quit the diſſipated, and, in fact, vicious, ſociety of the drawing-room, or the eating parlour, to ſeek her in the innocent receſſes of the nurſery. With ſportive fondneſs ſhe would endeavour to make him take his ſhare in nurſing the bantling; and would anticipate their mutual pleaſure, when they ſhould have ſuch a plaything of their own. But from this ſubject he always appeared to ſhrink: and though he fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her to a nurſery rather than be abſent from her, he came there only for the purpoſe of draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her away from it.</p>

                     <p>ELLEN had now been at Stanton Park more than a month, and the little pleaſure ſhe took in the ſociety there, or rather, the poſitive diſappro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation ſhe felt towards moſt of the individuals who compoſed it, had cauſed her, as it were, to fold up her charms and her talents in a civil re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve, which forbade all familiarity in thoſe who approached her.</p>
                     <p>At this time mr. Villars arrived at Stanton Park.</p>
                     <p>There had never been any diſtinction between Ellen's manners towards him, and towards thoſe, who with him had frequented her houſe in town. There, whatever difference of character might really exiſt, in the interchange of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place civilities of an aſſembled intercourſe, little difference could appear. But here, where, in the freedom and familiarity of behaviour that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed, every vicious principle ſeemed to be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>played, and every depravity of the heart to be laid open—here indeed there was a decided diſtinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. When ſhe converſed with Henry, no cold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſat upon her brow, or reſtrained her tongue, Her heart was upon her lips. The ſmile of ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probation dimpled in her cheek, and ſparkled in her eyes.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="209" facs="unknown:036127_0207_100850B5B08CB600"/>Henry came immediately from Groby Manor to Stanton Park. Of Groby Manor, of her father, of her ſiſters, of her beloved Thorntons, ſhe was never weary of talking. There was no inquiry relative to all theſe, which was too minute, no circumſtance which was not intereſting.</p>
                     <p>In theſe converſations, it is true, Ellen wiſhed nothing ſo much as that ſir William ſhould par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take; for ſhe wiſhed nothing ſo much as that they ſhould be equally important to him. But the vivacity which the arrival of Henry ſeemed to have inſpired her with, was a mortal offence to ſir William, and a confirmation, "Strong as proof of Holy Writ," of all he had before ſuſpected.</p>
                     <p>From this period the moſt deadly hatred ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded in the breaſt of ſir William, to that love which he had once felt for Ellen: and from this period he nouriſhed the moſt determined reſolution of revenge.</p>
                     <p>But ſir William was indeed capable of that hypocriſy, of which he moſt unjuſtly ſuſpected Ellen. The dread he entertained of being marked as a jealous huſband, enabled him to diſſemble, even with her, the pangs which wrung his very ſoul.</p>
                     <p>Inſtead of the conduct he had manifeſted in town, he continued his newly reſumed fondneſs; frequently made Henry the object of his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>negyric; pointed out to her his ſuperiority to thoſe around him; ſhewed a pleaſure in his converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and always ſought to make Ellen a party in it. To this depth of diſſimulation he was inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated, not only by a deſire to eſcape the ridicule of jealouſy, but by a hope, that by thus la<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſuſpicion aſleep both in the minds of Henry and Ellen, he ſhould attain a certainty of that, which
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:036127_0208_100850B737C52D08"/>
though he did not doubt, he could by no means prove: and nothing ſhort of proof he knew could bear him out, even in his own opinion, in the courſe he was reſolved to purſue.</p>
                     <p>The art of ſir William was much more than a match for the ingenuous innocence of Ellen. She entertained not a doubt but that he was convinced of the injuſtice of his former ſuſpicions: and the moment ſhe believed ſuch ſuſpicions were aban<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, ſhe ſincerely forgave them. She con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, that he really was well ſatisfied that ſhe ſhould entertain and manifeſt towards Henry, that couſinly regard which ſhe had never diſavowed, but which, on the contrary, ſhe had always de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared ſhe ſhould carry to her grave. On the ſtricteſt examination of her heart, ſhe diſcovered nothing in her ſentiments for Henry which ſhe could wiſh to conceal: and when ſhe beheld, as ſhe believed, ſir William relieved from every jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous doubt, ſhe had on this ſubject nothing farther to wiſh. Henry too appeared to have recovered his natural tone of mind: and Ellen ſecretly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratulated herſelf on the accompliſhment of thoſe hopes, which had cheered the darkeſt gloom of her former ſorrows.</p>
                     <p>Ellen's temper was ſanguine. There were mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments in which ſhe could have believed any thing as certain, which it was poſſible the united efforts of virtue and good ſenſe could produce.</p>
                     <p>"Now," ſaid ſhe to herſelf, "I ſee Henry happy. Sir William will in time be all I wiſh him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> His love for me will be as rational as it is tender. He will deſerve and I will give him my whole heart. After all my ſorrows, and all my apprehenſions, there will not be a happier lot than the one I have drawn."</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="211" facs="unknown:036127_0209_100850B9F83BC080"/>It depended wholly on ſir William to have realized this picture of happineſs. He choſe to convert it into ſcenes of the moſt genuine wretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs.</p>
                     <p>The delight with which ſuch thoughts often filled the mind of Ellen, as ſhe ſat converſing with ſir William and Henry, frequently ſpread an ineffable air of ſatisfaction and tenderneſs over her features. Henry at theſe moments beheld her as the image of virtue itſelf; and ſir William re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded her as the moſt abandoned of her ſex. "The time will come," thought he, "the time will come!"—and in this thought he was able to repreſs the reſentment which ſwelled his heart almoſt to breaking.</p>
                     <p>The taſk, however, of diſſimulation, at length became too painful: and he longed to begin the period of puniſhment and vengeance. Ellen was to lye-in in town: and to town for this purpoſe ſhe removed about the beginning of February.</p>

From that dignified and difficult ſpecies of compoſition, he has deſcended to amuſe himſelf with theſe eaſier and more artleſs ſtrains: and we are happy to remark, that the ſame lively fancy, the ſame delicacy of ſentiment, the ſame melodious flow of language, which marked that rapid production, and diverted the attention from ſome of cenſurable defects, may be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed in the little volume that now lies before us.</p>
                     <p>"It gives us pleaſure that Mr. Southey has recalled our attention to the ſorrows of our fable brethren, and tuned his harp to the mournful accents of the African. Six Sonnets on the Slave Trade are introduced by a ſhort Preface, in which he laments that the enthuſiaſm of thoſe who once difuſed the Weſt-Indian productions, was of ſo tranſitory a nature—and in which he conceives the only remaining alternative for the abolition of the Traffic, to be the introduction of maple ſugar, or the juſt and general rebellion of the Negroes."</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>"The letters now before us, are the production of a mind endued with an uncommon ſhare of penetration, long exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſed in the habit of accurate diſcrimination and deep reflection, both with reſpect to ſubjects of ſpeculation, and to human life and manners; and firmly poſſeſſed of that manly independence of character, which enables the inquirer to purſue truth wherever ſhe is to be found, and to follow her lead wherever ſhe leads.</p>
                     <p>"The author, Dr. Aiken, has already acquired no inconſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able degree of celebrity by his former uſeful and elegant pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions, in ſeveral different walks of ſcience and literature. The preſent work, while it affords new proofs, that he poſſeſſes ſuperior talents, and uncommon correctneſs of taſte, will ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibit him to the public, under the highly reſpectable charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a judicious obſerver, and a ſage adviſer. Agreeably to his motto, '<hi>Liberi ſenſi, ſemplice parole,</hi>' he has thought cloſely on a great variety of ſubjects, without ſuffering himſelf to be

ſhackled by ſyſtems, or led by authority; and he has commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated his thoughts, for the moſt part, in plain and ſimple, but always in pure claſſical language, perfectly ſuitable to the form under which thoſe papers appear as letters to his ſon.</p>
                     <p>"After the full detail we have given of the leading ideas and ſentiments of theſe excellent letters, it is wholly unneceſſary to ſay any thing farther in their commendation; only we muſt add, that they are, in our opinion, particularly deſerving the attention of young men, as happily adapted to ſuggeſt to them important and pleaſing topics of inquiry and reflection; to exerciſe their judgment, and improve their taſte; and to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh them with uſeful hints for the conduct of life.'</p>

                     <p>FROM the inſtant of their quitting Stanton Park, Sir William's behaviour was entirely changed. He ſeemed not now to wiſh to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe the ill opinion he had formed of her. He reproached her explicitly for the pleaſure ſhe had manifeſted in the company of Henry: and he openly exulted in the art with which he had laid her caution uſeleſs, and by which he had been able to aſcertain her real ſentiments.</p>
                     <p>Ellen heard Sir William with an indignant aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhment, which for ſome time deprived her of the power of ſpeech. She kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>w not how to defend herſelf againſt a charge, the truth of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:036127_0218_100850D2D3E1EF70"/>
which involved no criminality. She had conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered every mark of regard which ſhe had ſhewn to Henry, as ſanctioned by Sir William's expreſs approbation; and ſhe knew it did not contain a particle of that kind of love which the moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended of his rights could prohibit.</p>
                     <p>The reſentments of Ellen were always ſhort-lived: and even before ſhe had voice to reply to Sir William's injuries, ſhe felt ſomewhat like compaſſion, though perhaps a little mingled with contempt, riſe in her mind towards him.</p>
                     <p>'That it can ſuit your ideas of honour and tenderneſs,' ſaid ſhe, 'to endeavour to betray thoſe whom you are bound to defend, is what I can only be ſincerely ſorry for. But to treat that as a diſcovery which you owe to your own artifice —that, which at no time has been diſavowed on my part, is a vain endeavour to dupe me a ſecond time. Tho' innocence is unſuſpicious, it is not ſottiſh. Be aſſured you have diſcover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed nothing; for nothing was attempted to be concealed. From the firſt hour I accepted your heart, you knew the whole of mine. If you have not ſecured it your own long before now, the failure has not ariſen from my partiality to another, but from the want of thoſe qualities in yourſelf, on which only affection can be ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I have laboured to love you: and never were you ſo nearly in poſſeſſion of my heart, as at the moment when you have choſen to load me with the moſt injurious reproaches. What can I ſay, moſt unhappy of men, what can I ſay, but that my heart ſhall ſtill be yours, when you know how to deſerve it.'</p>
                     <p>Sir William trembled with paſſion. The truth
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:036127_0219_100850D7820EA450"/>
flaſhed upon him—it was the lightning's flaſh, that ſtrikes and kills. To believe himſelf alone accountable for the loſs of Ellen's true affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, was a pang of ſuch intolerable anguiſh, as human nature could not bear. To think her falſe and worthleſs, was a ſuffering of a milder kind. Barring his mind againſt conviction, he gave way to a rage which was only a temporary aſſuagement of his ſufferings, the ſource in fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the bittereſt ſelf-reproach.</p>
                     <p>The agitation that his violence occaſioned to Ellen, threw her into labour. Her ſituation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came critical and hazardous, in a very high de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree: and Sir William would have almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to ſee her in the arms of Mr. Villars, to be aſſured of her life. It was not, however, by the death of Ellen, that heaven had determined to puniſh Sir William. She was delivered of a boy, and declared out of danger.</p>
                     <p>Amidſt the varied anguiſh, compoſed of grief, terror, and reſentment, that filled the mind of Ellen, ſhe experienced, as ſhe claſped her child to her boſom, a ſource of joy, which no misfortune, that threatened herſelf alone, could embitter. Yet ſhe regretted but the more, that, in the father of her infant, ſhe could not love the huſband of her choice.</p>
                     <p>Sir William, under pretence of guarding her from every emotion that might be prejudicial, abſented himſelf for ſome days from her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and Ellen made uſe of this in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> to bring her mind into ſuch a ſtate of ch<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſhew her diſpoſed to forget all that had paſſed at their laſt interview.</p>
                     <p>She preſented his ſon to him, with a faint ſmile, ſaying: 'Let this be the pledge of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livion for all that is paſſed, and the aſſurance of an unbroken amity for the time to come.'</p>
                     <p>'A ſon!' ſaid Sir William, looking earneſtly in the boy's face.</p>
                     <p>'Did you not know it was a boy?' ſaid El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len.</p>
                     <p>'Yes,' returned Sir William, and again re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated, 'A ſon!'</p>
                     <p>'Dear Sir William, take your child into your arms. The touch of his lips will baniſh every uneaſy thought. I have found them a ſovereign panacea.'</p>
                     <p>'So might I too!—'</p>
                     <p>'Why do you not try then?'</p>
                     <p>'No; it is a woman's remedy.'</p>
                     <p>'It is a <hi>parent's,</hi>' returned Ellen.</p>
                     <p>'True,' ſaid Sir William; but he touched not the child.</p>
                     <p>Ellen, pained, wondering, confuſed, by a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of indiſtinct thoughts, haſtily ſnatched the boy to her heart, and burſt into tears.</p>
                     <p>Sir William alarmed, tried to ſoothe her by every tender expreſſion he could think of; but he did not careſs the child. Nor did he appear to regard it either as a pledge of oblivion, or as an aſſurance of amity.</p>
                     <p>Ellen recovered ſlowly: the anxiety of her mind affected her body. She ſaw Sir William gloomy and diſcontented: and though he reſtrain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf from acts or words of ill humour or
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:036127_0221_100850DCF3DBD160"/>
reproach, the ſame dark ſuſpicions ſeemed to lour in his mind, and the ſame reſentment to poſſeſs his breaſt.</p>
                     <p>Ellen was now able to go out in her carriage<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhe thought it proper no longer to delay mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sir William acquainted with the reſolution ſhe had formed. It was not long before he gave her an opportunity of doing ſo.</p>
                     <p>On meeting her one day on her return from an airing, he obſerved, that the colour began to return to her cheek, and the uſual life to appear in her eye: and he added, in a cold and reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful tone, 'You will ſoon be able to return to ſociety. You will ſoon be able to ſee <hi>all</hi> your friends.'</p>
                     <p>'I have a very few words to ſay, Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam, on that ſubject,' returned Ellen: 'and if you are at leiſure, be kind enough to hear them now.'</p>
                     <p>'You are not going to make me a ſpeech?'</p>
                     <p>'I do not deal in oratory,' replied Ellen. What I have to ſay, will be compriſed in a very few words.'</p>
                     <p>'Well, Mad<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>m, cried he, with an air of provoking mockery, 'I attend.'</p>
                     <p>'When firſt I was made ſenſible of the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt ideas that you entertained of my character,' ſaid Ellen, 'I was led to hope that ſuch jealouſy might only be the exuberancy of too ardent a love: and I truſted to that love and my own <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>
                        <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for the remedy. When I had reaſon to think the evil had a deeper root, that it ſpring from the conſtitution of your mind, and that, perhaps, you could not change it, I offered with the moſt genuine ſincerity, to withdraw with you
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:036127_0222_100850DE7AD6D9D8"/>
from the whole world, and to live only for you. This was treated as the flight of an abſurd and romantic mind: and I was enjoined to conduct myſelf to all with whom I converſed, without diſtinction. I obeyed this injunction as far as it was poſſible to obey it. The honeſt affections of the heart, which I had always avowed, and the difference that muſt ariſe in our intercourſe with the wiſe, and the fooliſh, the good and the bad, ſtood not controuled, nor could they by this injunction. You know if ever my diſtinction went beyond what ſuch affections and ſuch dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference could warrant: and I know moſt feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly, that notwithſtanding a conduct reſulting from ſuch principles, as will ſtand the ſtricteſt inveſtigation, I have not been able to acquit my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf in your opinion. I believe it impoſſible that you ſhould at this time doubt my honour: but you ſcruple not to tell me, that I have volunta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily given my affections to another. What may you not next believe?—I ſhrink from the thought: and it behoves me to preſerve myſelf from a ſuſpicion, that may involve in the effects of its injuſtice thoſe who are yet unborn. What I once aſſumed as a kindneſs to you, I now aſk as a favour and ſhelter for myſelf. I will not again join any ſociety, I will not again ſee any friends, that can awaken injurious doubts in your breaſt. If it is your will, that I ſhall remain in town, I will remain there as a cloſe priſoner in my own houſe. But if you wiſh to avoid the appearance of ſingularity, which this will have to the world, I beg you will ſuffer me to go down to Oakley: my health will furniſh a reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able pretence for ſuch a ſecluſion: and there I
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:036127_0223_100850E1375FE740"/>
cannot give you even the ſhadow of a cauſe for thoſe jealouſies which wrong me, and make you miſerable.'</p>
                     <p>Sir William appeared ſtruck with the greateſt aſtoniſhment, by the calm and impreſſive ſtate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that Ellen thus made of her wrongs, and of her conduct. Some purpoſe labouring in his mind, ſeemed, in ſpite of himſelf, to be ſuſpended by the power of truth.</p>
                     <p>'Would you go alone?' ſaid he.</p>
                     <p>'I ſhall not be alone. My boy will be with me: and I will yet hope, that all love for me is not ſo extinct in his father's breaſt, but that he may ſometimes be induced to viſit us.'</p>
                     <p>A ſudden ſhade of diſtruſt and indignation croſſed Sir William's brow.</p>
                     <p>'You doubt it not,—his father will viſit you.'</p>
                     <p>'I hope ſo,' ſaid Ellen warmly. 'Then you approve my plan, Sir William? You will ſuffer me to remove to Oakley?'</p>
                     <p>'Yes, to queen it there—to court popularity by inſidious charities—to form a party of the ſcum of the earth—to build your reputation on the downfall of mine.'</p>
                     <p>'Good God!' exclaimed Ellen: then check<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf, 'far are all ſuch thoughts from me,' ſaid ſhe. 'I have no predilection for Oakley. You have an eſtate in Wales: let me go there. Send me into the North of Scotland—baniſh me to Ireland,—do with me what you will; with this exception only, do not keep me here, and compel me into company, where the pureſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocence cannot preſerve me from the fouleſt ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picion.'</p>

                     <p>'I know not what means to uſe to convince you it is ſo, but ſuch as I have uſed in vain,' ſaid Ellen. 'It appears to me, that your mind is deeply infected with a diſtemper that nothing but time and your own reflections wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Let me wait the reſult of theſe quietly and inof<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fenſively, far from any poſſibility, by any man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners or conduct of my own, of increaſing the evils.—No happineſs reſults to either of us from being now together. On the contrary, ſo many cauſes of mutual offence may ariſe, as may ſerve definitively to alienate our hearts from each other, and make it impoſſible, at any future period, however diſtant, to entertain that mutual friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip ſo eſſential to our happineſs, our virtue, and our reputation.'</p>
                     <p>'Well,' ſaid Sir William, after a moment's pauſe, 'be it ſo; the experiment may ſerve as a trial in more ways than one. But whom do you mean to take into your ſecret? Who is to be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidant?</p>
                     <p>'No one. This is a ſecret I would willingly conceal from myſelf: and be aſſured I will not burden any one elſe with the knowledge of it.'</p>
                     <p>'And ſhall you not write a pathetic letter to <hi>your couſin,</hi> deſiring he will keep out of your way, and bidding him farewell?—And talk of the ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice of <hi>friendſhip</hi> to duty, the hope of better times, when innocence will have all its rights, when you may avow the <hi>eſteem</hi> with which you always have been, and always ſhall be—And ſo

turn a period and make a flouriſhing concluſion? —Would not this be according to rule?'</p>
                     <p>'The paroxyſm is ſtrong now, indeed,' ſaid Ellen. 'I will leave you, and wait your deciſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on as to where I ſhall go.'</p>
                     <p>'Stay; that may be decided in a moment. Oakley is the beſt place. Your retreat there will appear moſt natural, and raiſe leaſt conjecture. When ſhall you be able to go?'</p>
                     <p>'In leſs than a week: and I entreat you, Sir William, to let that time be ſpent with as little diſcompoſure as poſſible. On my part, you ſhall ſee nothing but good humour, and, if you will permit it, cheerfulneſs.'</p>

                     <p>She could not conceal from herſelf, that Sir William ſtudiouſly held her apart from her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily: and he had ſo profeſſedly ſet his face againſt Miſs Thornton, that, except one ſingle fortnight which ſhe had ſpent at Oakley, Ellen ha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>With lady Almeria, who was always ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſociety in which he himſelf found plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, and whom he knew Ellen could not love— and with her brother, who ſhewed not much love to her, he ſuffered her to aſſociate with that degree of familiarity which the nearneſs of their

connection warranted<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but he held her as much as poſſible aloof from the whole world beſides. He wiſhed her to be always in company: but he would have had the promiſcuous croud with which he had ſurrounded her, wholly and alike indifferent to her.</p>
                     <p>A mode of life, in which the affections had no ſhare, would have been, in itſelf, extremely irkſome to Ellen; and when joined to the more poſitive evils that Sir William ſpared not to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict, became inſupportable. At Oakley, ſhe ſeemed to repoſe as in a ſecure harbour, after having been long toſſed in ſtorms that threatened ſhipwreck.</p>
                     <p>She nurſed her boy: and this was one reaſon that was given to the world for her retiring to the country at that ſeaſon of the year when eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry body elſe was flocking to town. This occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation was a perpetual ſource of delight and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt to her. Alone at Oakley, ſhe could dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate the whole of her time and her thoughts to ſo delightful a care: and ſhe ſaw, or fancied ſhe ſaw, in the ſtout limbs, and intelligent ſpark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling eyes of her darling, the proof and reward of her more than common love.</p>
                     <p>Lady Almeria had dragged her poor little baby to town with her, where neglect and want of good air ſoon reduced it to a very pitiable object. Ellen was told it was ill, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>With her two children, and the various means of occupation which her underſtanding and her

heart provided her with, Ellen began to regain a degree of eaſe and happineſs, which, except at very ſhort intervals, had been long a ſtranger to her boſom. All remains of reſentment towards Sir William entirely ſubſided. She again flattered herſelf, that if ſhe could once inſpire him with a taſte for the calm delights of the country, ſhe might be able in time to correct his unhappy aptitude to ſuſpicion, to eradicate all jealouſy from his mind, and, making him worthy of her love, to love him with an affection more reaſonable, and as warm as any he had ever felt for her. She congratulated herſelf on the part ſhe had taken; and was ready to perſuade herſelf that her paſt vexations were only a more certain road to happineſs.</p>
                     <p>She wrote to Sir William frequently, detailing all ſhe did, and recounting the witticiſms of Almeria, who, however, could not yet ſpeak, and the wonderful tricks and achievements of her boy. In return, Sir William's letters were ſhort, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining little but the anecdote of the day, and never replied in any way to the domeſtic and nurſery ſtories which made the ſubject of Ellen's.</p>
                     <p>Ellen was willing to lay all this inſenſibility to the way of life Sir William was engaged in, ſo unfavourable to the feelings of the parent and the huſband; and to hope the cure for all lay in his being made ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>WHILE Ellen was thus indulging herſelf in every virtuous propenſity, and already began to reap the reward that uſually attends the gratifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of ſuch propenſities, Henry was a prey to the moſt tormenting diſquietude.</p>
                     <p>On his arrival in town, he had learned Ellen's removal into the country: and he had heard aſſigned as a reaſon for it, her own health, which had ſuffered much from her confinement, and the cares ſhe had taken upon her, with reſpect to her boy. Nothing could appear more natural than theſe reaſons: and with Henry, who knew Ellen's diſpoſition, they would have found, but for one circumſtance, a moſt ready belief.</p>
                     <p>Sir William's conduct during the time they had all paſſed in Devonſhire together, had completely deceived him. He believed that Sir William felt for Ellen all the love that ſhe was ſo well formed to inſpire: and he never had reaſon to ſuppoſe that Ellen did not rejoice in and return his love. But in Henry's opinion, it ill conſiſted with ſuch a mutual affection, that Sir William ſhould ſuffer Ellen to go without him into the country, in circumſtances in which ſhe m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> be ſuppoſed particularly to call for more than common atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:036127_0230_100850F4BA2AEA38"/>
or that he could conſent ſo ſoon to loſe ſight of their firſt pledge of love; a boy too, which is generally as dear to a father as a mother.</p>
                     <p>It was this circumſtance that raiſed a ſuſpicion in the mind of Henry, that there was ſomething more in Ellen's preſent retirement than the world in general believed. Yet was he cautious in his endeavours to diſcover whether his ſuſpicions were grounded in truth, leſt he ſhould commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate ſimilar doubts to others.</p>
                     <p>He threw himſelf as much as poſſible in the way of Sir William, who preſerved towards him the manners he had held when they were together in Devonſhire: it being Sir William's unalterable reſolution, even in the vengeance that he medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated againſt Ellen, that the world ſhould never know that he had entertained a ſuſpicion of her virtue or her love.</p>
                     <p>Sir William would often ſpeak of Ellen, would mention the partiality ſhe entertained for a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try life, the new-born attachment to her boy, which ſeemed to ſwallow up every other affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: and ſometimes he would lament that it deprived himſelf, and the reſt of her friends, of her company in town.</p>
                     <p>Henry upon theſe occaſions was ſtrongly tempted to aſk, what could detain him there, while Ellen was in the country: but as he could not forget, neither could he hope, that Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam could forget the connection that had once been between Ellen and himſelf. The remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance of this connection impoſed a ſcrupulous delicacy upon him, whenever he mentioned El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len to Sir Wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                        <pb n="19" facs="unknown:036127_0231_100850F64D5B8E40"/>As it was a ſubject he never began, ſo it was one that he always put an end to as ſoon as poſſible. Sir William perceived this ſhyneſs and imputed it to the worſt of motives. From a reſtleſs de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſire to diſcover what he dreaded to aſcertain, he ſcarcely ever ſaw Henry without introducing, in ſome way or other, the ſubject of Ellen's retire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: and Henry at length began to think there was ſomething of affectation, or deſign, in this.</p>
                     <p>While Henry's mind was in this ſtate of ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, Lady Almeria awakened him to a much more lively ſuſpicion of the truth.</p>
                     <p>Lady Almeria's own attendant was couſin 'to the woman who waited upon Ellen. They were both Northumberland girls: and Ellen's ſervant had ſpent all her life, 'till taken into Ellen's ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, within a bow-ſhot of Groby Manor.</p>
                     <p>Hence ſhe could tell of the early love between her lady and Mr. Villars, of the cruelties of Lord Villars, the diſtreſs of the lovers, the ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den appearance of Henry on the eve of Ellen's marriage, with every circumſtance relating to the affair that was made public, and with many that had never happened, and which were reported from miſapprehenſion and conjecture.</p>
                     <p>It was from her knowledge of much that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally had paſſed, and from her belief in ſtill more that never paſſed, that ſhe had drawn the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluſion that Ellen would never love Sir William. Thus from the day of her marriage ſhe never ſaw a ſhade of diſcontent upon Ellen's brow, that ſhe did not impute (according to the cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-maid-like idea of the invincibility of a firſt paſſion) to her having been croſſed in love.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="20" facs="unknown:036127_0232_100850FA2D1D2220"/>With a mind thus pre-occupied by this fancy, it was not poſſible, that the whole of Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam's unkindneſs, and its effects upon Ellen, ſhould be entirely concealed from her. What ſhe fell ſhort of in real knowledge, ſhe made up in conjecture: and all ſhe conjectured ſhe reported as fact.—Much of it, indeed, was ſo; though ſhe did not know it.</p>
                     <p>Ellen having left ſome books in town, locked up in a cabinet, of which ſhe had the key with her in the country, about this time ſent her maid to town to bring them to her.</p>
                     <p>Jenny, who had her mind full of all that ſhe believed had happened in Sir William's family ſince ſhe laſt ſaw her couſin, made uſe of ſome of the few hours that ſhe ſpent in town, in a viſit to Lady Almeria's houſe: and there ſhe fully detailed to her ſiſter goſſip, all ſhe knew, and all ſhe believed ſhe knew.</p>
                     <p>She told of Ellen's violent illneſs, immediately following an angry converſation with Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam. She repeated ſome words ſhe had acciden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally overheard. She dwelt on the length of time which he had abſented himſelf from the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Ellen—on the diſlike that he ſeemed to have to the child—on the grief that ſhe had often witneſſed in Ellen's countenance and manner—on the unkindneſs of Sir William, in never having once viſited Oakley ſince Ellen had retired thither —and on the contentment and eaſe which Ellen ſeemed to experience, notwithſtanding his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence.</p>
                     <p>From all theſe circumſtances, thoſe two Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiavels concluded, with a certainty, that leſt no room for doubt, that Sir William was jealous of
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:036127_0233_100850FF67F2BAF8"/>
Mr. Villars; that he had baniſhed Ellen into the country to prevent their meeting; and that Ellen had more ſatisfaction alone, and left to the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance of her firſt love, than, from the unkindneſs and ſuſpicion of Sir William, ſhe had ever enjoyed in the world, and in his ſociety.</p>
                     <p>As Jenny ſincerely loved her miſtreſs, all Ellen did was right in her eyes: and if ſhe had been employed by her in carrying on an intercourſe with Henry, ſhe would eaſily have excuſed her on the ſcore of the unconquerable nature of a firſt paſſion, and the provocation received from a jealous huſband; ſuch circumſtances forming a ſpecies of apology, that in vulgar minds is a ſufficient excuſe for every enormity.</p>
                     <p>But as Jenny thought Ellen extremely injured, ſo ſhe knew her to be perfectly innocent: and hence ſhe painted her as the moſt patient ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferer, and Sir William as the worſt and moſt unkind of human creatures.</p>
                     <p>Lady Almeria's woman had often heard her Lady expreſs ſomewhat of contempt, and a good deal of ſurpriſe, on Ellen's withdrawing from town at that ſeaſon of the year: and ſhe had heard her throw out, as no improbable ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that it was contrary to her own wiſh, and the effect of Sir William's arbitrary jealouſy. She had, however, alſo heard her declare, that ſhe was not in the ſecret, and did not in fact really know what the cauſe was.</p>
                     <p>Lady Almeria, among her other foibles, had that moſt pernicious one of buſying herſelf much in the affairs of others. She had always taken upon her to foretell that the marriage of Ellen with Sir William would end ill; and ſhe looked with
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:036127_0234_10085101081AFF38"/>
ſome degree of eagerneſs for every circumſtance that could tend to prove that her predictions were fulfilled.</p>
                     <p>From theſe defects in Lady Almeria's charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, Betty always found herſelf well liſtened to when ſhe talked of the characters of her Lady's acquaintance, or repeated anecdotes out of their reſpective families.</p>
                     <p>All, therefore, that ſhe had heard from her couſin, was moſt eagerly poured out as a torrent, the next time ſhe attended upon Lady Almeria: and it was poured out with all thoſe exaggera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and embelliſhments that ſo readily occur to every relator of every ſtory, who wiſhes to make the moſt of what is to be told. Every thing that Betty related, found ready credence with Lady Almeria: and in a few hours after ſhe had heard the ſtory, meeting with Henry:</p>
                     <p>'Now,' ſaid ſhe, 'I can clear up the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derment of Lady Ackland's running away from us in ſuch a ſtrange manner. That brute, Sir William, is jealous of you: and he means to confine Ellen to Oakley as long as ſhe lives. And woe be to you both, if you approach the threſhold!'</p>
                     <p>Henry turned pale as death.</p>
                     <p>'Let me beg, Lady Almeria,' ſaid he, 'that you will not indulge yourſelf in ſuch wild fancies, —much leſs repeat them.'</p>
                     <p>'Oh! you don't believe me?—Come this way then; and I will give you ſuch a proof as will clear my veracity in a moment.'</p>
                     <p>'Why ſhould I be convinced of what would give me inexpreſſible pain to believe?'</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="23" facs="unknown:036127_0235_100851039C490720"/>'It cannot give you more pain than it does me. I have been in a perfect fidget ever ſince I heard it. I am ſure I dare not tell Mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt half: he'd be for cutting Sir William's throat, or ſome ſuch thing, for you never heard of ſuch a dragon.'</p>
                     <p>Henry's curioſity now got the better of his prudence: and he liſtened to all Lady Almeria had to tell. But with what emotions he liſtened to it, it is not poſſible to expreſs. His whole frame trembled: and his agitation was ſo great, that lady Almeria began to repent that ſhe had choſen a public aſſembly for ſuch a communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>'Come, I will tell you more,' ſaid ſhe. 'How you do love this Ellen ſtill! I do not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve there is ſuch another conſtant ſwain in the bills of mortality.'</p>
                     <p>'I muſt know all now,' ſaid Henry, 'coſt me what it will. You have ſet me on the rack.'</p>
                     <p>'But I dare not. It will be you that will be for cutting Sir William's throat at this rate.'</p>
                     <p>'No, I have no ſuch thoughts. Sir William will live ſafe from my vengeance. But what is there more to hear?'</p>
                     <p>'Bleſs me, not much. It is eaſy to ſuppoſe what a jealous, an unreaſonable man will ſay and do. But Ellen is ſo reſerved that I don't find ſhe has ever complained, even to her maid.'</p>
                     <p>'Complained!—To her maid!—' repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Henry. 'No, Ellen knows how to ſuffer, but not to complain.'</p>
                     <p>'And ſo ſhe will have no redreſs! I ſee no mighty wiſdom in that. Were I in her place I would complain, and loudly too. Men may be
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:036127_0236_10085107DE7491E0"/>
managed by their fears: and Sir William would not dare to uſe her ſo, if he thought ſhe would expoſe his conduct to the world.'</p>
                     <p>Henry was in no humour to diſcuſs the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety of ſuch maxims: and finding he could draw no farther particulars from Lady Almeria, he earneſtly recommended what yet he could not hope ſhe would practiſe, the ſtricteſt ſilence; and withdrew with a heart oppreſſed almoſt beyond ſufferance.</p>
                     <p>Although Mr. Villars was well aware of the ſuſpicious quarter from which he had received his intelligence—and though in any matter where the happineſs of Ellen had not been concerned, ſuch evidence as that on which it reſted, would not have fixed any circumſtance for a moment in his thoughts—yet in a caſe where ſo much was at ſtake, his apprehenſions gave credibility to the moſt doubtful teſtimony: and this teſtimony ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be confirmed by ſeveral particulars, of the truth of which he could not entertain a doubt.</p>
                     <p>He knew the ſudden and dangerous illneſs of Ellen, which was now aſcribed to Sir William's violence, to be a fact: and he had before been told, that it had been occaſioned by a fright. It was alſo certain, that ſhe had retired into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and that Sir William ſo far from accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panying her, had never even viſited her ſince her reſidence there. The frequent, and what now more than ever appeared to be officious converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, with him upon this ſubject, returned with added effect upon his mind: and he felt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that they had been held with a deſign to confirm or do away ſuſpicions which he was now convinced Sir William had entertained.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="25" facs="unknown:036127_0237_100851096429F328"/>Theſe ſuſpicions ſeemed, it is true, ill to agree with the friendly and open conduct he had held towards him while in Devonſhire; or with the continuation of the ſame in their intercourſe in town. But Henry could not help fearing, that this conduct, which might be uſed as a cloak to his real thoughts, was rather a proof that the evil lay deep, than that it did not exiſt.</p>
                     <p>A thouſand ſchemes did he revolve in his mind as to what he could or ought to do towards the diſcovery of the truth; and towards the allevia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the evil, if it did ſubſiſt. But to every one he found inſupportable objections; and was obliged to reſt in the concluſion, however con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to his wiſhes he might find it, that the ſafeſt and beſt courſe he could purſue, was to do noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p>Impelled, however, by feelings very ſimilar, Sir William and he met continually. Their minds were equally occupied by the ſame ſubject; and though both were ſhy in their manner of treating it, they found no intereſt in any other.</p>
                     <p>Henry obſerved that Sir William enquired fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently into his motions; and remarked, that he was particularly inquiſitive whether his love for hunting did not carry him often to the Lodge. Henry was ſometimes, upon ſuch occaſions, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed, by his eagerneſs to do away all ſuſpicion in Sir William's mind, into a minuteneſs of detail and a warmth of denial, that rather ſeemed as the cover to the truth, than the ſimple declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of it.</p>
                     <p>Seldom, therefore, did Sir William and Henry converſe together without Henry being more than ever convinced of the jealouſy Sir William had

                     <p>By theſe converſations, and the reflections Sir William made upon them, his mind was at length wrought up to ſuch a pitch of miſery and indig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, that he reſolved to withhold the meditated revenge no longer: but, preparatory to the blow he intended to ſtrike, it was neceſſary to ſee Ellen, and lull her if poſſible into perfect ſecurity.</p>
                     <p>For this purpoſe he no longer delayed to viſit Oakley. There, however, ſuch a ſcene awaited him, as again broke in upon all his deſigns, and ſuſpended his mind once more in the agitating balance of uncertainty.</p>

                     <p>SIR WILLIAM found Ellen blooming with health, and her ingenuous countenance marked with the placid look of content, which virtue only can impreſs. He found her buſied in every rural and every domeſtic care, living with the children perpetually in her arms, occupied wholly with them, and apparently without a thought which wandered from the environs of Oakley.</p>
                     <p>He was received by her with ſuch marks of genuine ſatisfaction, as ſeemed not to leave a doubt but that he was truly welcome to her, and that it would be his own fault if he did not derive from her ſociety every happineſs he could deſire.</p>
                     <p>Such appearances were ſo entirely incompati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with the guilt he had been ſo ready to impute to her, as to compel him for ſome time, in ſpite of himſelf, to do her juſtice. Yet, if ſhe did not love Henry, how came ſhe to be ſo happy in the abſence of her huſband? The anſwer that his conſcience forced from him to this queſtion, gave <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>im a pang of ſelf-reproach, that he knew not how to endure.</p>
                     <p>If her heart be not another's—yet I have loſt it for ever, thought he. But no, it is in loving
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:036127_0240_10085112C1CD1710"/>
Henry that ſhe has ceaſed to love me. My con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct towards her has juſtified this dereliction in her eyes; and hence the eaſe and ſatisfaction that appears in her countenance; hence the deep hypocriſy ſhe is enabled to maintain.</p>
                     <p>Such thoughts as theſe were ſupplanted by others more worthy of Ellen: and theſe were again driven from his mind by freſh ſuſpicions and new jealouſies. What would he not have given for Morgana's cup, or the little boy's mantle.</p>
                     <p>Ellen remarked the perturbation of his mind: and ſhe ſtrove to allay it by the moſt affectionate cheerfulneſs. It would not have been poſſible to have ſuppoſed from any word or look that eſcap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ellen, that ſhe had withdrawn into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to avoid the violent effects of the moſt unjuſt jealouſy; or that ſhe retained an atom of reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the injuries ſhe had received. A per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect oblivion as to all that had paſſed before her removal to Oakley, ſeemed to pervade her mind. She appeared willing to conſider that period as a new epoch of her life, from which, if he pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Sir William might date their mutual hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs.</p>
                     <p>Sir William had now ſpent three weeks in Berkſhire: and ſo far had the mild and wiſe de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meanor of Ellen wrought upon his mind, that he began to conſider all his paſt fears but as the horrors of a frightful dream from which he was now awakened.</p>
                     <p>If he could always live with Ellen at Oakley, he thought he could ſubdue his jealouſy: but to live always at Oakley, even with an angel, was what little ſuited his taſte. It would not, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever,
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:036127_0241_100851144AC91BC0"/>
he knew, be difficult to perſuade Ellen to continue there altogether. This indeed appeared to be what ſhe deſired: and if he could be aſſured that ſhe lived there wholly to herſelf and chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, he was willing to flatter himſelf, that the kindneſs with which he doubted not ſhe would always receive him when he choſe to join her, would be ſufficient for his own happineſs.</p>
                     <p>To this ſcheme of ſelfiſh felicity there was only one objection aroſe in his mind: he feared there might be ſome myſtery in the choice Ellen ſeemed to have made of Oakley for her reſidence. The neighbourhood of the Lodge recurred to his remembrance; and brought with it a ſudden pang of jealouſy that made him ſtart.</p>
                     <p>The experiment, however, he thought worth trying. If Ellen were innocent, ſhe might be ſafely truſted at Oakley. If ſhe were guilty, the place of her abode was a matter of little conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. Time and obſervation could alone clear this important point: and to time and obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he reſolved to refer it.</p>
                     <p>Sir William was in this ſtate of mind, not wholly cured of his ſuſpicions, and yet willing to believe them ill founded, when an event hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, that ſeemed to his diſturbed imagination to carry conviction with it. It fixed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moveably in his plan of vengeance, and ſealed the deſtiny of Ellen.</p>
                     <p>Both the children were ſeized at the ſame time with the meaſles: and the diſorder put on its moſt alarming form. Ellen diſpatched a meſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger inſtantly to Lady Almeria; and ſhutting her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf up in the apartment with the children, watched them with equal and unremitted ſolicitude. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:036127_0242_10085117908CD8D0"/>
Lady Almeria arrived, the little girl was apparently out of danger: but the boy continued in a ſtate of the greateſt hazard.</p>
                     <p>Ellen, who had not a thought that ſhe could diſguiſe from him, did not obſerve the almoſt undiſſembled indifference with which Sir William viewed the child's danger, and her ſorrows. But it ſtruck every body elſe. Lady Almeria conſidered it as a full confirmation of all that ſhe had been told. She had promiſed to inform Henry of the progreſs of the child's diſeaſe: and ſhe ſcrupled not to mention in the moſt explicit terms, all the obſervations that ſhe had made on Sir William's conduct.</p>
                     <p>Henry was almoſt driven to diſtraction with the idea of Ellen's ſufferings, and Sir William's cruelty: yet durſt he not attempt to alleviate the one, or to puniſh the other. He could only en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat Lady Almeria not to remit the frequency and particularity of her details: and he waited the event in town, with all the anxiety and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turbation that he might have felt, had he been indeed the father of the child.</p>
                     <p>Not all the exertion of the beſt medical ſkill, nor all poor Ellen's ſolicitous and unwearied care, could prolong her darling's date on earth, or keep its ſpirit one moment from its native ſky.— It died!—And Ellen remained a motionleſs image of deſpair, by the ſide of the bed on which it had expired.</p>
                     <p>Sir William had been out in his grounds; and, returning, entered the apartment to make his uſual cold inquiry, in his accuſtomed words of, 'How go you on?'</p>
                     <p>'It is all over!' ſaid Lady Almeria.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="31" facs="unknown:036127_0243_100851196F204520"/>'Thank God!' ſaid Sir William, and ruſhed out of the room.</p>
                     <p>Ellen looked up; and inſtantly ſunk down ſenſeleſs, and to all appearance lifeleſs.</p>
                     <p>Lady Almeria's ſhrieks brought Sir William back. 'You have murdered her—you have killed Ellen,' ſaid ſhe.</p>
                     <p>No words can deſcribe Sir William's conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation. He hardly knew the force of the words that had eſcaped him, and the effect they had had upon Ellen appeared incomprehenſible. But the ſight of her, pale and breathleſs before him, drove him almoſt to inſtant madneſs. He caught her in his arms; and, eager to remove her from the chamber of death, carried her to her own apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. There, while every method was uſed to reſtore her, he threw himſelf on his knees before her, and, regardleſs of all preſent, earneſtly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plored her forgiveneſs, upbraiding himſelf as the moſt cruel and unjuſt of men, and promiſed never-ceaſing love and confidence, if ſhe would but live to bleſs him.</p>
                     <p>Ellen opened her eyes. But, as if the ſight of Sir William was baneful to her, ſhe put her hands before them and wept bitterly.</p>
                     <p>Sir William ordered every body to retire.</p>
                     <p>'No! no! no!' ſaid Ellen.</p>
                     <p>'Do you then hate me?' ſaid Sir William, 'Dare you not truſt yourſelf with me?'</p>
                     <p>Theſe words brought Ellen to her recollection. 'Do not talk ſo, Sir William. But I am very ill. I want aſſiſtance?'</p>
                     <p>'I will aſſiſt you. I would give my life for yours: and do you refuſe to let me attend you<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                     </p>
                     <p>'Leave us,' ſaid Ellen faintly.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="32" facs="unknown:036127_0244_1008511E8F498B30"/>'Oh! Sir William,' ſaid ſhe, when they were alone, 'what mean thoſe words of love, after you have given me ſuch a proof of your deadly hatred?'</p>
                     <p>'A proof of deadly hatred!—Oh! Ellen, how you wrong me! what ſenſe can you have put upon my words, to make you think them words of hatred?'</p>
                     <p>Ellen wept but could not ſpeak.</p>
                     <p>'The ſubject is too delicate,' continued Sir William, 'to explain upon. But is it an unpar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable crime, when hope was extinct, to have been grateful that ſuffering was no more?'</p>
                     <p>Ellen was ſilent.</p>
                     <p>'Deareſt Ellen, ſay, you miſunderſtood; that you are convinced. Do not perſiſt in an error ſo injurious.'</p>
                     <p>'I cannot ſpeak. My heart is cruelly oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed: but never need you dread injuſtice from me.'</p>
                     <p>'Then, my deareſt love, look upon me. Do not thus turn from me, as if the very ſight of me was hateful to you. Often have I given you cauſe of offence. Never did I find you unforgiving. Now when I would not offend you, be not leſs kind.'</p>
                     <p>'I would not think that there has been offence given. I would not think that there is room for forgiveneſs.'</p>
                     <p>'Then, in this embrace, be all miſapprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion forgotten. Be aſſured, you cannot be grieved, without my taking a part in your affliction.'</p>
                     <p>'I will endeavour to believe it. But take it not unkindly, if I wiſh to be alone, I am very greatly afflicted. I cannot now make uſe of the full powers of my mind. I cannot at this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:036127_0245_10085120183DA488"/>
be all you wiſh me to be, or all I ought to be. Let me recollect myſelf. I hope ſoon to be reſigned to all the ill I am deſtined to ſuffer, and alive to all the good that is ſtill afforded me.'</p>
                     <p>'May you conſider my love,' ſaid Sir William, embracing her, 'as the greateſt ſhare of that good; and as a proof you do ſo, do not baniſh me long from you.'</p>
                     <p>Sir William then left her, and endeavoured to calm the diſturbance of his mind, by perſuading himſelf that he had given ſuch a ſenſe to the unkind words that had eſcaped him, as would effectually remove from the mind of Ellen all apprehenſion of their real meaning.</p>
                     <p>Whatever were the ſuſpicions that had dictated theſe words, and whatever the impulſe to which he had yielded in uttering them, he was ſenſible there was a barbarity in their ſound, that no motive, and ſcarcely any offence, could juſtify. He doubted not but Lady Almeria would repeat them: and he ſaw his character at ſtake. In perſuading Ellen that they were only the effuſion of compaſſion, he knew he ſecured a warm ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocate: and in the kindneſs of their intercourſe he ſaw a refutation of any cenſure to which his unguardedneſs might have expoſed him</p>
                     <p>Theſe were the ſelfiſh motives upon which his preſent conduct was founded. But he was not without a very ſenſible compunction for what had paſſed, and had a very lively intereſt in the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of Ellen. He had lately accuſtomed him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to conſider her as rather injured than injuring: and in this light he felt for her a revival of his firſt paſſion: and, mixed as it was, with pity to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, and reproach to himſelf, the expreſſions
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:036127_0246_10085122B607AA40"/>
of it were more lively and tender than even in the firſt days of their marriage.</p>
                     <p>But Ellen's heart was no longer in a ſtate to receive pleaſure from the love of Sir William. No explanation that he could give to words ſo cruel and wounding, could do away the effect they had produced in her mind. Without fully underſtanding the feeling from whence they ſprung, ſhe felt them as the greateſt and moſt unprovoked unkindneſs he could have been guilty of. The careleſs indifference he had ſhewn through the whole of the poor baby's illneſs, now ruſhed upon her recollection, and ſhe found it impoſſible to believe that words ſo ſtrong had ariſen only from a ſudden impulſe of compaſſion to ſufferings to which he had ſo long appeared inſenſible. Yet why Sir William ſhould rejoice in the death of his child, except becauſe it was the ſource of her pureſt delight, ſhe could not gueſs. She had often thought, that he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered the boy with jealouſy, as an object which had occupied that place in her heart, which he alone ought to have poſſeſſed; but for a jealouſy ſo ſelfiſh and unjuſtifiable, with all her candour, ſhe could find no excuſe. A ſentiment of diſguſt and reſentment now therefore mingled with the deep grief of Ellen for the loſs of her child; nor could all her efforts to ſubdue it, wholly ſucceed. But grief in this caſe did more for her than reaſon. So overwhelming was her affliction, that it overcame every other feeling: and had the cauſe of the offence been unconnected with the ſubject of her ſorrow, it would have been inſtantly obliterated from her mind.</p>

                     <p>WHILE Ellen remained almoſt wholly abſorb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in grief, a circumſtance happened, which broke in upon her affliction, and convinced her, that no ſtate could be wholly wretched which afforded the benevolent heart an opportunity of adminiſtering to the wants of others.</p>
                     <p>Her letters from Northumberland informed her, that the grandſon of her favourite protegee, Deborah, a young man diſtinguiſhed for his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence, honeſty, and induſtry, had, from ſome unavoidable misfortunes, fallen into the greateſt diſtreſs, and that he, his wife, and two children, were in jail. Charlotte, who wrote the hiſtory, deplored the utter impoſſibility of her father to afford any effectual aſſiſtance to ſo much unde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved miſery; as the ſum neceſſary for that purpoſe was not ſhort of two hundred pounds, a ſum much too large for him to ſpare from the immediate wants of his own family.</p>
                     <p>Ellen's heart ſeemed to leap in her boſom, when ſhe read this account. Sir William had always <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>tinued his uſual allowance to her: and the little occaſion ſhe had had for money for ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny months paſt, had made her rich. By antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pating

a part of her next quarterage, which might be made eaſy by a little future economy<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe was able immediately to command two hundred pounds: and by the return of the poſt ſhe tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted a draft upon Sir William's banker for that ſum.</p>
                     <p>It is needleſs to attempt explaining the joy and gratitude of the family, whoſe miſeries ſhe reliev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Their joy, however, was not ſhort of her own; nor was her gratitude leſs when ſhe raiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her thoughts to the Giver of all Good—the giver of that good which includes all other, the giver of a good heart. This tranſaction ſhed a calm over the mind of Ellen, and contributed more towards reſtoring her to peace, than any gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification merely ſelfiſh could have done.</p>
                     <p>Lady Almeria had been but too faithful a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tailer to the wretched Henry of the whole ſtory of the death of the child, and the conſequent ſorrows of Ellen: and he felt on the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, his ſufferings increaſe to ſo intolerable a degree, that he found it impoſſible to forbear ſome effort towards their alleviation. Yet, when he conſidered that all his information came from La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy Almeria, and reflected upon her unfeeling character, and the talent ſhe had in exaggeration, he thought it prudent to judge with his own eyes, and determine, by his own obſervation, before he took any ſtep, the conſequence of which might involve the conduct of Ellen as well as his own.</p>
                     <p>Ellen, from the extent of her grief, which took in the whole of her mind, excep<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

ſharpneſs of reſentment, had been able to receive Sir William's attention and ſolicitudes with ſuch a degree of ſatisfaction and gratitude, as ſeemed to ſpeak to all lookers on, that perfect harmony was reſtored between them. Ellen had been alſo particularly ſoftened towards Sir William by his generoſity, unlike his uſual character, towards the grandſon of poor Deborah. The circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of what Ellen had done for him came ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidentally to his knowledge: and he was too ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute not to perceive the favourable opportunity now in his power, of doing more towards rein<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtating himſelf in Ellen's favour, than all his ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died fondneſs to herſelf could ever have produced. He praiſed, in the higheſt terms, Ellen's benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence; and by imitating, give an irrefragable proof that he approved it. To the two hundred pounds he added another, as a means by which the young man might be enabled to enter the world again with ſome advantage.</p>
                     <p>On this occaſion, Ellen looked upon Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam with an air of the ſweeteſt complacency: and ſhe once more ſaid to herſelf, his heart will at length open to the true uſe of riches. Our minds and our wiſhes will be in uniſon: and we ſhall be happy.</p>
                     <p>Sir William had explained the offenſive words to lady Almeria, in the ſame ſenſe in which h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sir William that could juſtify her former opinion, or the tales of Jenny.</p>
                     <p>She was not, however, willing, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thoſe favourable appearances, to ſuppoſe her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf miſtaken: and while ſhe acknowledged in her letters to Henry, the change that had taken place, ſhe ſcrupled not to impute it to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſummate art of Sir William, who meant by this means to deceive her. For the truth of this conjecture ſhe appealed to the ſorrow in which Ellen was ſtill plunged; and which, ſhe ſaid, it was impoſſible to believe occaſioned by the death of a brat not four months old.</p>
                     <p>But Henry, who ſaw no ſuch impoſſibility, conſidering the peculiar circumſtances in which Ellen was placed, and feeling his hopes revive, that her ſorrows did not wholly flow from ſo irremediable a cauſe as he had been taught to believe, thought this a proper time, when Sir William was with her, and they appeared to be on perfect good terms with each other, to make uſe of his own obſervation to come at the truth if poſſible. For this purpoſe he came down to the Lodge: and the next morning af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter his arrival, walked over to Oakley. He had been told by Lady Almeria, that Ellen was ſo much indiſpoſed, that ſhe ſeldom left her a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment 'till two o'clock in the day: and he had therefore choſen an hour for his firſt viſit, in which he believed he ſhould only ſee Sir William.</p>
                     <p>He had croſſed a corner of the park, and had entered through a part of the gardens which led him directly to a ſmall hall where ſervants al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways waited. But in going towards this hall<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

he neceſſarily paſſed before the breakfaſt-room windows, which opened to the ground, and at which at that moment Lady Almeria was ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. They ſaw each other: and Lady Almeria beckoning to him, ſaid, 'So you are come? I thought you could not ſtay away: but you have good information: for I ſuppoſe you know Sir William is not at home?'</p>
                     <p>'Sir William not at home?' repeated Henry, 'Why did you not tell me ſo before?'</p>
                     <p>'Oh, he went away two days ago, upon ſome ſudden buſineſs or other, that ſignified not a far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, and will ſtay away a week I believe. Well, ſit down, and I'll run and tell Ellen. I am ſure the ſight of you will do her good.'</p>
                     <p>'Stay, I beg you will ſtay,' ſaid he. 'Do you ſuppoſe, knowing all you do, that I would ſee Lady Ackland in the abſence of Sir William?'</p>
                     <p>'Why not? I tell you it will do her good: and it was an hundred to one but you had found her in this room. She is much better than ſhe was, and comes down to breakfaſt: but <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>'Tell Sir William indeed! No, I will never tell him any thing that I think can give him ſatisfaction. But, in the name of common ſenſe (for as to high-flown heroics I do not pretend to

                     <p>'If half what you have told me is authentic, I think you may anſwer that queſtion yourſelf. My viſit was to Sir William, not to Lady Ack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land: and when Sir William returns I will repeat it. I have no objection to ſeeing Lady Ackland: but I will not ſee her apart from her huſband.'</p>
                     <p>'But why not give yourſelf the merit of your mighty forbearance with Ellen?—Objection to ſeeing Lady Ackland indeed! I know you would give one of your eyes to ſee her with the other. Why not tell her what hardſhips you impoſe upon yourſelf for her ſake?'</p>
                     <p>'Dear Lady Almeria, would you have me ſhew to Lady Ackland, that I know Sir William is jealous? I hope in God this is a truth ſhe will always remain ignorant of. Have you not told me yourſelf, that even to you ſhe will never appear to ſee this: and ſhall I convince her, that not only you, but that I am in poſſeſſion of the fatal ſecret—a ſecret ſhe wiſhes to conceal from the world!'</p>
                     <p>'Why then did you not ſtay and ſee her, as you would do if you knew nothing of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter?'</p>
                     <p>'And ſo expoſe her to the unjuſt ſuſpicions and unkind treatment of Sir William. Even you ſuppoſe I had received intelligence of his abſence: and do you think he will be leſs liable to fall into ſuch an error? When Sir William knows of my viſit, and knows I have not ſeen Lady Ackland, it will be impoſſible but that he ſhould believe, what is truth, that I came to ſee him, and not her.'</p>

                        <pb n="41" facs="unknown:036127_0253_10085137426AA318"/>'Well, I pretend to no great ſkill, either in matters of prudence, or in matters of ſentiment.

If it were agreeable to my migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Lord ſo much the better for him: if the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, he would be ſoon weary of complaints that hurt nobody but himſelf.

                     <p>'Good morning then: and I entreat you do not ſay I have been here.'</p>
                     <p>Henry darted out of the room; and to avoid the path that would have detained him for ſome time within ſight of the windows, turned haſtily into a more private one, which led into a part of the pleaſure ground, that did not connect with that part of the park by which he had entered. After wandering about ſome little time, he found his way over a fence, from which he regained the public road, and from thence his own houſe.</p>
                     <p>When here, he reflected upon the eſcape he had, and upon the injury he might have cauſed Ellen, had he ſeen her in Sir William's abſence. Such a circumſtance would, he well knew, have car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried to a jealous mind, conviction of a private correſpondence. He determined to learn for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearance for the future, and from henceforth to act as if the ſorrows and injuries of Ellen were indifferent to him. The evil that might have attended the gratification of his ſolicitude upon this ſubject, though he had guarded, as he thought, the maſk of it with every poſſible cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, fixed the pang of ſelf reproach in his h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Alas! if the poſſibility of increaſing the ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows of Ellen appeared thus inſupportable to the feeling and generous heart of Henry, what would have been his anguiſh had he been con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of the evils he had already prepared for her. Determined by theſe thoughts, Henry mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured his ſteps back to London; and firmly reſolved, on no pretence whatever, again to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt ſeeing either Sir William or Ellen.</p>
                     <p>Lady Almeria had a ſharp conteſt between her love of communication, and her pride, which was ſomewhat piqued by Henry's words, 'If it be poſſible you can keep a ſecret.' Her deſire to ſhow him that ſhe could, prevailed more than any motives of prudence or delicacy, or deſire of obliging him, in inducing her to hold her tongue<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but being fidgetting and reſtleſs under this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint, ſhe dragged Ellen with her into the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den, and then ran away from her, to look all around, for the purpoſe of ſeeing if Henry was quite gone.</p>
                     <p>Ellen was returning ſlowly alone to the houſe, when ſhe ſaw, with ſome ſurpriſe, Sir William coming towards her. He was attended by a ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, whom ſhe heard him queſtion very <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>'Yes; and poor Lady Almeria is ſo tired, I think ſhe would have left me to myſelf, if you had not returned to put an end to our tête-à-tête.'</p>

                     <p>Here they reached the houſe: and Ellen was glad to repoſe herſelf upon a ſofa. Sir William ſtood ſilent before her, with his eyes fixed intently on her face, and loſt in deep thought.</p>

                     <p>LADY ALMERIA returning to the houſe, learnt from Ellen the unexpected return of Sir William; and ſhe learnt it with much ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; for being heartily tired with her reſidence at Oakley, ſhe was reſolved to ſeize the moment when Ellen had a companion to leave it. She therefore replied, 'Well, then, you'll want me no longer: and therefore I will return to town to-morrow, where, I flatter myſelf, many people want me.'</p>
                     <p>'You will leave me,' ſaid Ellen, with a deep ſigh, 'you will leave me your little girl?'</p>
                     <p>'Moſt willingly. But I hope you won't think of ſtaying here: you'll never recover your ſpirits if you do. But if Almeria grows inconvenient to you, either ſend her to me in town, or let her maid take her down into Devonſhire.'</p>
                     <p>Lady Almeria then went to give ſome <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Lady Almeria returned ſometime afterwards to the breakfaſt parlour<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and it occurring to her, that it would be a good thing to apprize Henry
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:036127_0258_10085144F1CBDD20"/>
of the arrival of Sir William, ſhe wrote him the following lines.</p>
                     <p>'Sir William returned this morning. You made your eſcape in the nick of time. The ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my would have been upon you in a moment. Now, however, you may make your approaches in all due form, and with a decorum that will ſet ſuſpicion at defiance. I ſhall be gone to-morrow; ſo to all your other motives, you may add that of charity, for your viſits here. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps the world will be kind enough to impute them wholly to that laudable principle. However, pray come; for poor Ellen will be moped to death, if left wholly to the converſation of <hi>caro ſpoſo.</hi>'</p>
                     <p>This note ſhe left open upon the table, while ſhe ran up ſtairs to countermand ſome directions ſhe had given to her maid. She was not abſent ten minutes: but Sir William entering the room in her abſence, his eye was involuntary caught by his own name, written in Lady Almeria's hand. No motive of honor, or delicacy, could at that moment have reſtrained him from the gratification of his curioſity. He read—every word was a dagger to his heart. He ruſhed out of the room into the garden, with the fury of a mad man, impelled by a ſudden impulſe, to ſeek Henry, and make him atone by his blood for the injury he could no longer doubt he had received from him.</p>
                     <p>A few moments, however, brought him to calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er reflection. His reſolution was previouſly taken, and taken upon what he thought a certainty lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſhort of that which he had this moment recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved. But ſuch evidence as this brought convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

with it: and he felt ſomewhat like ſatisfaction, that, acting upon ſure grounds, that would now be juſtice, which might before have been cruelty. His victim, if a victim he made, he had always determined ſhould be Ellen. Her criminality was, in his eyes, of a much deeper dye than Henry's. It was the complicated product of hypocricy, infidelity, and treachery. He conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered each action of her life, ſince he became her huſband, as marked with the moſt vicious duplicity: and he held himſelf acquitted to his own heart, for uſing the ſame means for the puniſhment of vice, which, he believed, had been purſued in the perpetration of it.</p>
                     <p>The preſent tumult of his mind, however, was too great to eſcape notice, if he were to ſubject himſelf to obſervation. He returned, therefore, to the houſe; and ſummoning his ſervant, complained of ſudden indiſpoſition, and went to bed.</p>

                     <p>Ellen was not, however, ſo well ſatisfied with Sir William's medical ſkill, as to rely wholly ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther upon his account of the cauſe of his illneſs, or in his confidence in its cure.

If he were really ill ſhe could not doubt, but that he would do all that was neceſſary in ſuch a caſe: and if any thing had ariſen to vex him, ſhe thought her influence to calm his mind, would be exerted with the moſt hope of ſuceſs, when he appeared more willing to liſten to her. She therefore retired to her own room; and there
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:036127_0261_1008514ECABD3CB0"/>
waited in anxious ſuſpence, 'till Sir William's bell ſhould give her a pretence again to appear in his apartment.</p>
                     <p>While theſe things were paſſing, Lady Alme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ria had returned to the breakfaſt-room, had ſealed her note, and diſpatched it to the Lodge, by the ſervant whom ſhe was ſending to the neighbouring town, for poſt horſes for her car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage the next day. When ſhe was told Sir William was ill, ſhe was ſomewhat alarmed, leſt ſhe ſhould be again involved in the cares of charity, and that his illneſs ſhould be of ſuch a nature as would not allow her, with decency, to leave Ellen while it continued. She went to Lady Ackland's appartment, to make all the enquiries poſſible; but could learn nothing more that was ſatisfactory.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, the phyſician arrived: and Ellen deſired he might be ſhewn immediately to Sir William. The ſervant, however, informed her that he had received the moſt poſitive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands from his maſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>, not to enter his room until called for, and that he durſt not diſobey.</p>
                     <p>As Ellen's fears on the account of illneſs had very much ſubſided, ſhe yielded to the ſervant's remonſtrance; and affected to ſuppoſe that Sir William ſlept, and that ſleep would be his cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain cure. In her ſtolen viſits to the door, ſhe had obſerved all was quiet; and began to hope that the paroxyſm of ill humour, which ſhe was induced to think was the whole of the caſe, was going off.</p>
                     <p>About eight in the evening, Sir William rang his bell. His ſervant found him up: and on being told that Doctor Wilſon was in the houſe,
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:036127_0262_10085151B83BCC38"/>
he readily admitted both him and Ellen. With a kind of bitter raillery, he treated her wife-like fears, that had induced her to trouble Doctor Wilſon to ride ten miles in a hot day, to viſit a man who had gone to bed to ſleep off a head-ach; and ſtre<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>Doctor Wilſon affirmed it did; and aſſured Ellen ſhe need have no farther apprehenſion, for that Sir William had known how to cure himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Ellen, convinced that her ſuſpicions as to the non-exiſtence of any complaint, were perfectly well founded, now withdrew; and informed Lady A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>'Thank God!' ſaid Lady Almeria.</p>
                     <p>Ellen could not help ſmiling. 'I am ſure Sir William is much obliged to you for the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt you take in his health!' ſaid ſhe</p>
                     <p>'Piſh!—no. That's not quite the thing. But you know I have fixed to go to town to-morrow: and I could not have gone, and left Sir William ill, and you ſo drooping.'</p>
                     <p>Then ſhook her head; and moralized a little to herſelf, on the good and ill that attended a diſpoſition ſo thoroughly ſelfiſh.</p>
                     <p>Sir William appeared both at ſupper and at breakfaſt next morning: but it happened that he was never an inſtant with Lady Almeria apart from Ellen: and if he had been ſo, it is probable ſhe would not have mentioned the viſit Henry had made, both from the reaſon ſhe had given, of never willingly contributing to the
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:036127_0263_100851538A802028"/>
ſatisfaction of Sir William, and the feeling no particular ſtimulus to relate that which had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing out of the common way to recommend it, and which contained no miſchief in it.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe ſhook hands at parting with Ellen, 'Pray endeavour to recover your ſpirits,' ſaid ſhe. 'But you ought to go ſome where. You'll never be yourſelf again if you ſtay here.'</p>
                     <p>'I think,' ſaid Sir William, after Lady Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria was gone, 'I think for <hi>once</hi> Lady Almeria gives good advice. I have been thinking of the ſame thing. What ſay you to an expedition for ſome little time?'</p>
                     <p>'I will accompany you any where willingly,' ſaid Ellen, her heart beating with the hope that Groby Manor would be the place thought of.</p>
                     <p>'Your health, your ſpirits, require ſome change of ſcene,' returned Sir William. 'Our new-born happineſs (hurryingly, and with a cloud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed brow he ſpoke it) requires nurture.

                     <p>The thought of Northumberland croſſed El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len's mind; and prevented that promptneſs of compliance with which ſhe uſually met any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal from Sir William.

                     <p>'How inexplicable, how impenetrable is the heart of a woman?' exclaimed Sir William.</p>
                     <p>'Indeed, my dear Sir William, you make the myſtery you ſeem to wonder at. Surely there is not a leaf in the whole book of nature ſooner read than that of my heart.'</p>

                     <p>'I think I ſhould like to go from Vienna to Venice,' ſaid Ellen; 'from thence through the Tyrol to Switzerland. I ſhould be ſorry to leave Switzerland out of our tour. But we ſeem to be furniſhing materials for a very long abſence.'</p>
                     <p>'We could eaſily paſs through a much grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter extent of country, than we have marked out, in much leſs time than we think of being abſent.'</p>

                     <p>'Well, this is only a rough ſketch of what we may do. We muſt model it as circumſtances and inclination may ariſe.'</p>
                     <p>'But do you really deſign to leave England next week? Is it poſſible we ſhould do ſo? Muſt we not have a travelling carriage built?

                     <p>Sir William then left her, and with an air as if he would immediately begin his preparations: and Ellen retired to her room with a mind ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely diſtreſſed and embarraſſed by the conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration of all that had paſſed ſince the preceding morning. She could not help connecting this ſudden journey with the diſcontent and diſtur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bance Sir William had manifeſted the day before. But all her reaſoning and all her penetration were unequal to the diſcovery of the link that was between them.</p>
                     <p>From the habit, which had ariſen from princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, that Ellen had acquired, of always looking on the bright ſide of events, and of opening her mind to all the good it was poſſible they could produce, ſhe was enabled at this moment to ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due a crowd of painful apprehenſions, and indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinct fears, that aroſe in her thoughts. She endeavoured to gather from ſome words that had fallen from Sir William, that his preſent conduct was deſigned as the final teſt of her integrity and affection<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhe flattered herſelf that a prudent management on her part would fix the content of her future life upon a tolerably firm baſis.</p>
                     <p>It was this thought that had made her ſo readily yield her conſent, and her reaſonable deſire of ſeeing her family before her departure, to the needleſs hurry, as it appeared to her, and
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:036127_0268_1008516207DC8708"/>
capricious wiſhes of Sir William: and it was this thought, that inſpired her with fortitude to conceal the bitter regret that ſhe felt in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of this ſacrifice. She was reſolved that Sir William ſhould ſee on her part nothing but good humour and alacrity: and ſhe hoped that in the cheerfulneſs with which ſhe quitted every other attachment to accompany him, he would find a full refutation to thoſe unjuſt ſuſpicions that had hitherto deſtroyed her peace, together with his own.</p>

                     <p>THERE is no virtue which ſo immediately produces its own reward, as a vigorous exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the mind, ariſing from a purity of prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</p>
                     <p>Ellen ſoon felt that cheerfulneſs and that alacrity which ſhe had judged it proper to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume. She wrote without delay to her father, informing him of the journey ſhe was about to undertake. But ſoftening the apparent harſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of their declining to viſit Northumberland before the ſet out, by repreſenting that Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam's haſte to be abroad aroſe from his ſolici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude on her account, which would not ſuffer him to liſten to any delay: ſhe intimated a very probable hope, that her abſence would be much ſhorter than was at preſent talked of. She ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſted that it would depend upon her perfect
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:036127_0270_1008516AD9828098"/>
reſtoration to health: and as ſhe could truly ſay, that all remains of indiſpoſition were even now trifling, ſhe dwelt upon the ſtrong probability, that they muſt meet again early in the ſpring. She endeavoured, by an appearance of cheerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and ſatisfaction, to leave no doubt upon the mind of her father, that the journey met fully with her concurrence: and ſhe promiſed the moſt conſtant and minute details of all ſhe ſhould ſee or hear.</p>
                     <p>The letter, however kindly deſigned, or artfully framed, by no means anſwered the purpoſe for which it was written. Mr. Mordaunt was ſtruck with the glaring inconſiſtency of the degree of indiſpoſition, that required ſo precipitate a remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val into another country, and the choice that had been made of the country to which the inva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lid was to be removed. The climate of the northern part of Germany ſeemed ill calculated for the recovery of a conſtitution debilitated by ſickneſs and ſorrow.</p>
                     <p>Ellen had indeed mentioned, as a concurring motive for her journey, that from change of ſcene was hoped a relief to her ſpirits, as well as from a change of climate to her health. But Mr. Mordaunt well knew, that, if left to her own choice, Ellen would have ſought every relief that ſhe could hope for her mind in Northumberland, rather than elſewhere: and the cheerfulneſs which ſhe had aſſumed in her manner of writing, with the pleaſure ſhe affected to take in the proſpects before her, ſeemed to ſay, that ſhe did not ſtand in need of much aſſiſtance in this way.</p>
                     <p>Theſe reflections perplexed and diſturbed Mr. Mordaunt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and he reſolved to ſee Ellen before
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:036127_0271_1008516C8AC96210"/>
her departure. He wrote accordingly to inform her of his intention: but that he might not delay for a moment a journey upon which Ellen had deſcribed Sir William as ſo earneſtly bent, he told her, that he ſhould immediately proceed to town, where he hoped he ſhould be time enough to catch them for a few hours as they paſſed through it; he having underſtood from Ellen that Sir William did not mean to make even a day's ſtay in the metropolis. But Sir William's haſte defeated Mr. Mordaunt's kind purpoſe: and though, had he known the fears and ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cions that had found their way into Mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt's mind, he would willingly have ſpared not one day only, but ſeveral days for the purpoſe of removing them; yet it not having occurred to him that Mr. Mordaunt would not reſt ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied with Ellen's repreſentation of the matter, he was not aware that there were either fears or ſuſpicions to remove.</p>
                     <p>On the very day that Ellen's letter arrived at Groby Manor, ſhe and Sir William left Oakley for London. Contrary to the firſt plan, they paſſed two nights and a day there: but purſuing their journey the day following with diligne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, they had ſailed from Harwich before Mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt reached town.</p>
                     <p>The circumſtance that had detained Ellen a whole day in town, was the ſudden marriage of her own maid. Jenny had been courted by a young man, ſon to one of Sir William's prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal tenants. It had been agreed that the match was not to take place until the young man could take a farm of his own: and this they had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as ſomewhat a diſtant proſpect. But the
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:036127_0272_1008516F48CF6AB8"/>
day after Sir William had determined upon the plan of going abroad, his ſteward had offered a farm to Thomas upon ſuch advantageous terms, that nothing was wanting but the conſent of Jenny to become his wife, to make him one of the moſt contented of men. Jenny objected to the impoſſibility of leaving her Lady ſo ſuddenly, and ſo much to her inconvenience. But her ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples were ſoon overcome by the rhetoric of Thomas: and ſhe mentioned, though with ſome reluctance, to Ellen, how unlucky it was, that ſhe was obliged juſt then to go into foreign parts, when if ſhe were to ſtay at home, ſhe might have been married to Thomas.</p>
                     <p>Ellen eaſily underſtood her: and as no per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonal inconvenience ever cauſed her to heſitate, when the happineſs of others depended upon her deciſion, ſhe cheered Jenny with a ready and kind conſent to her remaining in England, and by aſſuring her, that ſhe did not apprehend any unpleaſantneſs to herſelf in conſequence of her doing ſo.</p>
                     <p>Sir William ſeemed highly pleaſed with Ellen's diſintereſtedneſs on this occaſion; and gratified both the miſtreſs and the maid, by making Jenny a very handſome nuptial preſent.</p>
                     <p>Ellen received this act of Sir William as a farther proof, that his manner of thinking was becoming more congenial to her own. Of ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants he generally ſpoke as of creatures of a lower order of beings, who were bound, if well paid, to conſider themſelves, without murmuring, as the ſlaves of caprice and the victims of tyran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. She had feared he would have inveighed at the ingratitude and unfeelingneſs of Jenny:
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:036127_0273_100851720A523A28"/>
and ſhe had prepared ſeveral mollifying argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to make him ſubmit quietly to the incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience her ſudden deſertion muſt occaſion. She was much delighted to find him in ſo differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent a diſpoſition; and readily acceded to his requeſt, that, as ſhe had now no Engliſh ſervant, to whoſe ſervices ſhe had been accuſtomed, ſhe would ſupply Jenny's place with a foreign one, which, he aſſured her, ſhe would find much more convenient during her ſojourn abroad.</p>
                     <p>Ellen had written to Lady Almeria to deſire ſhe would find her ſome perſon who could ſupply the preſent emergency: and the choice ſhe had been obliged to make between ſeveral candidates had detained her in town. Having fixed upon the leaſt exceptionable, ſhe had diſmiſſed Jenny; and with her new attendant had proceeded on her journey.</p>
                     <p>Nothing could exceed Mr. Mordaunt's diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, when, on his arrival in town, he found Ellen had left it. But he had ſuch comfortable aſſurances both from Lady Almeria and his ſon, of the ſtate of her health, and the eaſe and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent contentment of her mind, that he became perfectly ſatisfied in every reſpect, but that of having miſſed the pleaſure of ſeeing her. He imputed the unneceſſary hurry which had accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied their departure wholly to the ſolicitude of Sir William, to re-eſtabliſh the health of Ellen, a little aided by the pleaſure that it was reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to ſuppoſe he would feel in returning to the ſcenes and habits of foreign courts: as it was very apparent that thoſe of his native country, were not nearly ſo pleaſing to him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="62" facs="unknown:036127_0274_1008517393012490"/>Mr. Mordaunt returned to Northumberland, well enabled by the ſatisfaction his own mind had received, to tranquillize the anxious appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions of Ellen's friends and well wiſhers, who were, indeed, as numerous as her acquaintance, with only the exception perhaps of her own mother.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Mordaunt, however, had long ceaſed to feel that rancour of diſlike, which for many years had occaſioned ſo much miſery to Ellen. Her marriage had removed her from the ſituation where her ſuperior qualities had given Mrs. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt perpetual umbrage: and the power that this marriage had given Ellen, of gra<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She had written her every faſhionable anecdote ſhe could collect; and had furniſhed her with every new play, or political pamphlet, which made the converſation of the day; and which, from being early communicated to Mrs. Mordaunt, enabled her to ſupport that ſuperiority over her country neighbours, in which all the deſires of her ſtill exiſting vanity ſeemed now to cen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>. Mortification, too, had humbled her: and though it had not corrected the faults of her temper, it had made her more careful to conceal them. The conſtant ſight of her eldeſt and favourite daughter, who, with her two children, drew their ſcanty ſupport, and to the inconvenience of the family, wholly from Mr. Mordaunt, was ſuch an undeniable proof of the fatal conſequences of
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:036127_0275_100851755A01CE70"/>
her misjudging pride and vanity, as compelled her to appear to adjure the principle that had led to ſuch fatal miſtakes. She no longer dared to expreſs a deſire to rule in a family, every in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual of which ſuffered, in one way or other, from her once unbounded ſway. A never inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting diſcontent preyed upon her heart, and undermined her conſtitution. The marriage of her ſon with Lady Almeria, from which ſhe had hoped to have derived ſo much ſatisfaction and conſequence, yielded her neither one nor the other.</p>
                     <p>Lady Almeria ſhewed her the moſt pointed diſreſpect; never condeſcended to viſit her; or invited her daughter to partake with her in the amuſements of her country houſe, or the gaieties of a London life. The unwiſe and unjuſtifiable partiality ſhe had manifeſted towards her ſon, he repaid, rather as if he conſidered the effect than the motive. No conſideration for her maternal tenderneſs ſoftened with him the cenſure which her character ſo well juſtified, and he by turns ridiculed and diſregarded her.</p>
                     <p>From Mr. Mordaunt however ſhe continued to receive every mark of conſideration and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and as her increaſing ill health ſoftened his heart towards her more and more, all paſt offences were by degrees forgotten by him, and ſomething like his firſt love began to revive in his heart.</p>
                     <p>From the contemplation of a character ſo ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiſh as Mrs. Mordaunt's, it is relief to turn the mind to that of Henry's.</p>
                     <p>Stunned as he was at the firſt intelligence of Ellen's journey to the continent, and by the
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:036127_0276_100851799A1D8C00"/>
certainty that ſhe was thus removed from his ſight and obſervation, yet when he learnt from Lady Almeria her improved health, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently recovered eaſe of mind, he found ample compenſation for every ſelfiſh pang, in the hope that ſhe was now about to reap the reward of a virtue and ſtrength of mind which had proved itſelf ſuperior to all the buffetings and croſſes of fortune. In the progreſs, and event, as he hoped it would prove, of her trials, he acknowledged the force of that principle of the mind, which makes the inviolable preſervation of a once vowed duty the rule for conduct, and the ſtandard of happineſs.</p>
                     <p>Ellen will purſue, thought he, her path of rectitude in foreign climes, far, far diſtant it is true from me: but if I am enabled to tread the line marked out for me, with an equally ſteady foot, then, in ſpite of preſent diſtance, and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bably future ſeparation, we ſhall meet at laſt— meet where no decorum, no unjuſt ſuſpicions, no unworthy fear, will reſtrain the pleaſures of our intercourſe. We ſhall meet where we ſhall be allowably dear to each other through a long and happy eternity.</p>

                     <p>WHILE with theſe kind thoughts and flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hopes the Engliſh friends of Ellen endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to conſole themſelves for her abſence, ſhe was purſuing her route abroad with much leſs ſatisfaction than ſhe had promiſed herſelf.</p>
                     <p>The haſte with which ſhe had quitted England, had occaſioned every hour from the moment when the ſcheme was firſt ſuggeſted to that in which I had taken place, to be wholly occupied with preparations for the journey: and ſhe had had little leiſure or opportunity to attend to the occupations of Sir William, who was equally engaged with herſelf. In the little communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion ſhe had with him on any ſubject apart from the one that ſo mutually employed their thoughts, ſhe had had reaſon to believe him ſatisfied with her; and though his ſatisfaction was not accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied by the gaiety that it uſed to be, before any unkindneſs had ariſen between them, yet it appeared of that genuine kind, which promiſed continuance and increaſe.</p>
                     <p>Ellen, however, ſoon began to fear, that her willingneſs to believe the beſt, had deceived her.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="66" facs="unknown:036127_0278_100851819C8A3E70"/>A profound gravity, almoſt a gloom, ſeemed to have pervaded the mind of Sir William. He treated her with an auſtere coldneſs, totally dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent from any thing ſhe had hitherto ſeen in him: and as the burſts of paſſion and ſallies of ill humour ſhe had before been expoſed to, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared the reſult of ſudden and irreſiſtible ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, and had therefore ſubſided as the ſuſpicion vaniſhed; the arbitrary ſeverity that he now aſſumed towards her, ſeemed as if it could only be juſtified by a conviction of her depravity. It was the lordly tone of a deſpotic huſband, which he now took upon him: and he extended his privileges to the regulating the moſt trifling arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of her economy. Her own ſervant appeared to be particularly the object of his caprice: re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peatedly Ellen was obliged to change her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dant: and every ſucceeding one ſeemed but ſtill more the object of Sir William's diſlike.</p>
                     <p>Ellen's correſpondence with her Engliſh friends was more than every thing elſe a cauſe of offence to Sir William. He reproached her continually, that though in perſon ſhe had accompanied him abroad, her thoughts, her wiſhes, and her affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, were in England. He ſeemed to regard every packet ſhe received with ſuſpicion; and ſometimes ſcrupled not to hint, that they ſhould never be happy together until ſhe broke off all intercourſe with every one but himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Ellen turned a deaf ear to all ſuch inſinuati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons. Nothing, ſhe was reſolved, ſhould induce her to make ſuch a ſacrifice of her duty, nor any thing but force compel her to it. 'All the affections in a good heart, would ſhe ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times ſay, are ſo cloſely entwined, that the
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:036127_0279_1008518376177920"/>
one cannot be deſtroyed without the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the others. If I did not love my pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, my ſiſters, and my friends, I could not love you.'</p>
                     <p>Sir William underſtood nothing of this: and as he had given up the hope of being beloved by Ellen, his preſent unkindneſs was rather the reſult of ill humour, than the effect of jealouſy. Of the guilt of Ellen he had no doubt. The readineſs with which ſhe had concurred in his ſcheme for leaving England, the cheerfulneſs and good humour which had accompanied this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence, he conſidered all as parts of that maſs of intended hypocriſy, which he believed, had pervaded her whole conduct, from the firſt hour of their marriage—an hypocriſy that ſwelled her guilt, in his apprehenſion, beyond all bounds, and excited in his breaſt a proportionate reſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment: he had been willing to appear duped by it, while it could any ways further his own pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes: but he was determined to puniſh it by every act of unkindneſs and provocation, which an irritated and revengeful mind could ſuggeſt.</p>
                     <p>In a more generous and candid diſpoſition than Sir William's, the conciliating and affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate manners of Ellen, with the ingenuous frank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of her ſentiments, muſt have produced different effects. They muſt have induced a doubt of the ſtrongeſt appearances that indicated guilt in her: they muſt have led to explanation and acquittal: or at leaſt they muſt have ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended condemnation, and withheld the arm of chaſtiſement.</p>
                     <p>But Sir William's reſolution was taken. Noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing could now divert him from his purpoſe. It
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:036127_0280_10085187B7C920C0"/>
is true, had he been entirely maſter of himſelf, he would, until the moment of putting it into execution, have concealed all deſire of vengeance. But the ill paſſions rankling in his heart broke out in ſpite of every effort to the contrary, into paroxyſms of tyranny and ill humour: and poor Ellen was the victim of them all.</p>
                     <p>In theſe circumſtances it is not to be won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered at, if Ellen placed her moſt fervent wiſhes on a return to England, or that ſhe found little real ſatisfaction from the varying objects that occurred. But ſtill Ellen's diſpoſition and prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple of making the beſt of every thing, did not forſake her. Her perfect good ſenſe directed her to the beſt means for attaining this end. It taught her to keep her own paſſions under con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trol. It repreſſed the tyranny of imagination. It enabled her to balance the real good and evil of her ſituation: and it ſhewed her, that, in the ſcale of human miſeries, there were more above than below her. The circumſtances of every day ſeemed, however, to change this proportion.</p>
                     <p>The preſſure of Sir William's ill humour be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo perpetual, that Ellen, with all her patience and ingenuity, could ſcarcely contrive to eſcape one moment its weight. She hardly knew how to extract one drop of comfort from any reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that her preſent ſituation or future proſpects afforded.</p>
                     <p>She had nearly loſt all hope, that any conduct of hers could meliorate the diſpoſition of Sir William: and ſhe was farther confirmed in this hopeleſſneſs, by conſidering, that his preſent un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs could not be the fruit of any ſuſpicion ariſing from the events of the paſſing hour. She
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:036127_0281_1008518944CAFD60"/>
was ſeparated from all who were dear to her. She was alone with Sir William in a world where there did not exiſt an individual who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged her attention, or intereſted her affections. What, then, could he ſuſpect? what, then, could he fear? It was not poſſible, that the events of the preſent time ſhould excite either fears or ſuſpicions. This ill treatment, therefore, ſhe could only impute to a deep reſentment for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer imagined offences, to eſtranged affections, and to natural temper, evils hopeleſs of cure.</p>
                     <p>Mild reaſonings, cheerful tenderneſs, affection<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate attention, and hitherto unwearied patience, ſhe had tried in vain. She knew of no other remedies: and, reſigning hope, ſhe endeavoured to arm herſelf with a double ſtock of fortitude, and thus ſtrove to ſupport, with calmneſs and dignity, the miſeries of a deſtiny ſhe knew not how to eſcape.</p>
                     <p>She could hope little from time, except as the diſſolver of that union which, as long as it laſted, ſhe was now convinced, muſt be a ſource of unallayed affliction to her. But it was not in Ellen's nature, even in wiſh, to eſtabliſh her happineſs on the death of a fellow creature, no<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

She was deſirous in this, as in every other particular, to refer herſelf, wholly and without reſerve, to the diſpoſal of a being, on whoſe wiſdom and goodneſs ſhe had the moſt profound and unſha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>en reliance. She left events to his care, who, in ſuperintending an univerſe, withdraws not his attention for an inſtant from the ſmalleſt atom of which it is compoſed; and bent her ſolicitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

undivided, to the right conduct of that part allot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to her and on the performance of which depended a happineſs or miſery, as unlimited in degree as duration.</p>
                     <p>Ellen judging it expedient to avoid, if poſſible, all <hi>ſelf commiſeration,</hi> allowed herſelf little leiſure for reflection upon her chagrins. She contrived to be almoſt wholly occupied by the variety of per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons and things which their continual journeyings threw in her way: and as her general knowledge and the cultivation of her mind, fitted her to enjoy the beſt converſation, and ſupplied her with obſervations and reflections upon every ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of curioſity that occurred, either in nature or art, however ſhe might be deprived of happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, ſhe was by no means deſtitute of a very intereſting amuſement.</p>
                     <p>She never yielded to the ſupineneſs and lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gour, which, from the hopeleſſneſs of her ſorrow, would ſometimes invade her mind. She conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered it as a ſignal to rekindle her activity, and to double her efforts towards procuring occupation.</p>
                     <p>They moved from place to place, according to the will and caprice of Sir William: and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing conſumed ſome months in viſiting ſeveral of the Northern Courts of Germany, on the ſhores of the Baltic, and in a ſhort reſidence at Berlin, they found themſelves, towards the end of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cember, ſettled in a pleaſant houſe, on the banks of the Elbè.</p>
                     <p>Ellen was, on her firſt arrival at Dreſden, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced to Sir William's ſiſter. She found her perfectly well bred, and highly accompliſhed, aſſidious to render her all the little offices and attentions that politeneſs required, but apparently
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:036127_0283_1008518DE3AD83B0"/>
without a wiſh to cultivate any intimacy with her, beyond what common civility demanded. There ſeemed to be little attraction between their characters. Madam Teſchen had been ſo long abſent from her country, that England had no place in her affections. Her ſentiments and her inclinations were German: and the evident diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard and coldneſs with which Sir William treated Ellen, muſt unavoidably give her an unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able idea of her character, which it could not be expected, in the kind of intercourſe that took place between them, Ellen would be able to deſtroy.</p>

                     <p>ELLEN, indeed, ſoon found that neither with Madam Teſchen nor any one elſe was it Sir William's wiſh that ſhe ſhould aſſociate. He ſeemed unwilling that ſhe ſhould be known, or that ſhe ſhould have it in her power to make herſelf friends.</p>
                     <p>After ſhe had been introduced at court, and into all ſuch houſes as Sir William had been for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merly acquainted with, and after ſhe had ſeen all that the place afforded, worthy of curioſity, Sir William made it appear very evidently, that he was never ſo well pleaſed with her, as when ſhe remained ſhut up in her own habitation.</p>
                     <p>This deſire of Sir William's to ſeclude her from all ſociety, agreed much better with her inclination than her prudence. Sir William was ſeldom at home: and thus left to herſelf, and deprived of the means of indulging the active propenſities of her mind, or the benevolent diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions of her heart, ſhe found no intereſt in the common occupation which her books or her work afforded, ſufficiently powerful at all times to ſuſpend the querulouſneſs of regret, or the anticipation of fear.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="73" facs="unknown:036127_0285_100851963829FDA0"/>It became abſolutely neceſſary to find ſome employment, which, from its novelty, might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage her whole attention. In this dilemma, the advantage which would accrue from learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the German tongue, occurred to her. Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto ſhe had never continued long enough in any one place to attempt it: but ſhe had now more than ſufficient leiſure. It had been repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to her as extremely difficult: but this was rather an inducement to her to attempt to learn it at this time, than any diſcouragement. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever would call for the greateſt exertion of her faculties, and demand the largeſt ſhare of her attention, would beſt anſwer her preſent purpoſe in ſeeking employment: ſhe therefore reſolved to learn German: and ſhe hoped, in the labours of her underſtanding, to forget the ſorrows of her heart. She entered, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, upon her taſk with avidity. Her maſter attended her every day: and the eagerneſs with which ſhe bent her whole mind to the buſineſs, with her natural talents, ſoon convinced her, that the difficulties of the language had been exaggerated. She was not, however, diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the main end. The newneſs of the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuit intereſted her. It filled her time; and it filled her thoughts. It prevented her thinking of herſelf.—Employment (thought ſhe) is the great ſecret of contentment.</p>
                     <p>She had been thus buſied about ten days, when Sir William, whom ſhe ſeldom ſaw in the courſe of the day for more than a few minutes at a time, and who knew nothing of her new employment, unexpectedly entered her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="unknown:036127_0286_10085198E7D2B7A8"/>He aſked in Engliſh, angrily and eagerly, what ſhe was about</p>
                     <p>'I am learning German,' ſaid Ellen with a ſmile.</p>
                     <p>'And do you not know languages enough?' returned he rudely. 'What affectation is this of the love of ſtudy?'</p>
                     <p>Ellen doubted whether ſhe heard him aright. Among all the foibles of Sir William's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, he had always appeared wholly free from the mean jealouſy, which ſome men betray, of female talents and female acquirements. On the contrary, ſhe had often heard him declare, that in marrying, he had ſought not merely a miſtreſs but a companion: and he had ſaid, that his choice of her had been as much determined by the cultivation of her mind, as by the attrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of her perſon, or the ſweetneſs of her temper.</p>
                     <p>It is true, theſe were the fondneſſes of his early love; and might be, with reſpect to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, no more than the flatteries of it. But ſhe had invariably ſeen him ſeek the ſociety of the beſt-informed females: and he had always ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to have a more than common pleaſure in their converſation.</p>
                     <p>She knew not, therefore, what to impute his ſudden diſpleaſure to, on his diſcovery of her deſire to add another language to thoſe which ſhe already underſtood.</p>
                     <p>'You are not ſerious,' ſaid ſhe, 'that my attempt to learn German gives you offence?'</p>
                     <p>'Perfectly ſo, and I deſire you will immediately diſmiſs that gentleman there, and inform him that you ſhall not again require his attendance.'</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="75" facs="unknown:036127_0287_10083875F60BBD38"/>Ellen turning to the German, told him, in French, that ſhe was at preſent particularly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged; and that ſhe would let him know when ſhe again wiſhed to ſee him.</p>
                     <p>The man departed: and Ellen turning to Sir William ſaid, 'Pray, what am I to underſtand from all this?'</p>
                     <p>'That it is my will, that you do not learn German; and that any farther attempt to acquire the language will be, on your part, an act of diſobedience.'</p>
                     <p>'You have ſo little uſed me to ſo authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative a ſtyle, that you muſt forgive me, if I ſay I am ſomewhat ſurpriſed with it.'</p>
                     <p>'I knew the new philoſophy of matrimony, as with every thing elſe, is equality. But I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve we were united upon the old terms of the wife's obedience and ſubordination: and there ought to be nothing ſurpriſing, if I exact from you no more than what you voluntarily engaged to perform.'</p>
                     <p>'I thought I underſtood,' returned Ellen, 'that you preferred receiving your rights in the free-will offerings of love, rather than in the tribute of duty. If I am miſtaken, of two un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy people, you will be the moſt to be pitied. But you may be aſſured you ſhall moſt ſtrictly receive you due.'</p>
                     <p>'If there ever were a time when I had ſuch an option,' ſaid Sir William with a ſigh, 'is it not gone for ever? Will you, (added he, after ſome little pauſe) will you order your maid to fold up thoſe books? pointing to the German grammar, &amp;c. that lay upon the table, 'and I will put my ſeal on them.'</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="76" facs="unknown:036127_0288_1008519C90AB9FB8"/>'I will do it myſelf,' ſaid Ellen: and immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately wrapping up all the books and papers re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to the intended ſtudy, ſhe bound them round with a ſtring, lighted her taper, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented the parcel, and a ſtick of ſealing wax to Sir William.</p>
                     <p>While ſhe was thus employed, Sir William regarded her with the moſt fixed and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly attention. Preſerving an invariable ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, he took the wax from her, melted it at the taper, dropped ſome drops on the ſtring, and impreſſed it with his ſeal, then caſting up his eyes, 'Oh!' exclaimed he, with a deep ſigh, 'that there were a poſſibility of a doubt! that I might be again deceived!' and, ſo ſaying, he hur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried out of the room.</p>
                     <p>'Miſerable inconſiſtency!' ſaid Ellen, ſinking quite oppreſſed into a chair, 'thus ardently to deſire to be beloved, thus aſſiduouſly to deſtroy all ground for affection.'</p>
                     <p>After this incident Sir William ſeemed as if more than ever to ſhun being alone with Ellen. He appeared as if afraid that ſhe might reſume her influence over his mind. Her preſent ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation made her particularly intereſting. She was again with child: and ſhe could not help re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marking with ſurpriſe, that notwithſtanding Sir William's increaſing indifference towards her, this circumſtance ſeemed to give him much more ſatisfaction than he had appeared to derive from it, when ſhe believed herſelf in the full poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of his affections. To herſelf it conveyed little happineſs</p>
                     <p>The preſent depreſſed ſtate of her mind, and the remembrance of the bitter diſappointment
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:036127_0289_100851A0D6F98FB0"/>
in which her former hopes from the ſame ſource had ended, deprived her of the power of look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing forward to the birth of her child either a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>In this manner the winter paſſed away at Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Sir William had been more than once abſent from her for two or three nights at a time, either engaged in viſits to ſuch of his former friends as reſided at ſome diſtance from Dreſden, or in the purſuit of the ſports of the field. For the latter purpoſe he declared his intention, in the early part of the ſpring, of eſtabliſhing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, for ſome little time, in a Saxon village, on the confines of Bohemia. It was a part of the country with which he was well acquainted, and which would afford him plenty of game; and from the liberty of ſporting which he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from many of his friends, it would be fully in his power to purſue it.</p>
                     <p>Ellen had no reluctance to accompany him. She rather hoped advantage from change of place, than dreaded any increaſe to her preſent chagrins; and Dreſden had been to her too melancholy a ſojourn not to find ſome relief in bidding it adieu.</p>

                     <p>THEY were ſoon ſettled in a ſmall houſe little better than a cottage, in a ſmall Saxon village, ſituated in the mountain that ſeparates Saxony from Bohemia. Here, however, having previouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly provided themſelves with every neceſſary at Dreſden, they wanted none of the comforts and conveniences of life to which they had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed.</p>
                     <p>Ellen ſoon began to think her ſituation much improved. The manners and appearance of the villagers became extremely intereſting to her. In a little hamlet, ſcarcely containing twenty hou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, ſurrounded by extenſive foreſts, and appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently ſhut up by rugged and almoſt inacceſſible rocks from all intercourſe with civilized life, Ellen ſound a gaiety, a hoſpitality, a ſociability of manners, which ſhe had often in vain ſought for in more poliſhed ſocieties. Theſe were accompanied, it is true, by the hardeſt labour: but the virtuous exertions of individuals for the ſupport of their reſpective families, ſeemed to be the ſource of no obſtruction to the general hilarity.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="79" facs="unknown:036127_0291_100851A7D5159158"/>Ellen alſo obſerved, with pleaſure, that almoſt every body could read, and that this general dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion of knowledge was far from being an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to any of the cares of the moſt aſſiduous houſewifery. Clean, active, and ſpirited, the women particularly charmed her by the beauty of their ſhapes, and the animation of their looks; and ſhe more than ever regretted the want of a common language between them and herſelf.</p>
                     <p>In ſpite of this obſtruction to their more intimate intercourſe, Ellen ſpent much of her time in the cottages and in walks through the adjacent woods. She longed to clamber a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the rocks, as ſhe had been accuſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to do in happier days in dear Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland. But this her preſent circumſtances forbade.</p>
                     <p>Sir William was ſo frequently abſent, that he knew little how ſhe paſſed her time; and had he known, it could have made no objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>One of her favourite walks was round the back part of the village through a ſmall wood, which led along the ſide of a rivulet, which coming ſuddenly to an abrupt and ſomewhat ſteep rock, overgrown by bruſh-wood, threw itſelf down with a precipitancy that produced in miniature one of the moſt beautiful caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cades imaginable. The path wound gently be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low this rock: and the rivulet, after its fall, reſuming its calmneſs, flowed quietly along the valley.</p>
                     <p>Immediately at the foot of this rock was placed a cottage, which, from its ſituation and the accompanying features of the ſurrounding
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:036127_0292_100852BBEA8A7CD8"/>
ſcene, was pictureſque beyond deſcription: and Ellen had often ſtood contemplating it from above with a pleaſure inexpreſſible; and often had ſhe deſcended to reſt herſelf on the bench at its door, and to receive the welcome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment of a bowl of milk, with which its hoſpitable inhabitants were always willing to ſupply her.</p>
                     <p>One morning ſhe directed her ſteps to the favorite ſpot; and, finding herſelf more than uſually fatigued with her walk, thought with uncommon ſatisfaction of her reſting-place, the bench. What then was her grief and diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, when, arriving on the top of the rock, from whence firſt the cottage could be ſeen, ſhe looked for it in vain? The cottage was no more: but from its ſcite aroſe a curling ſmoke, which told with too much certainty its fate. Of ſelf in ſuch a moment no one would have thought. Ellen knew not that ſhe exiſted; but an with a precipitancy round the rock, that left her no breath when ſhe arrived at the bot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom of it.</p>
                     <p>Here ſhe found the ruined and deſolated fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily given up to all the horrors of deſpair. It conſiſted of a mother, two daughters, and three children, the offspring of one of the daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, the huſband of whom, a miner, being at preſent engaged at ſome diſtance from his home, had left the helpleſs females without that aſſiſtance which would probably have aver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted a calamity, which, with a lamentation uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs as their own, he would now only be able to deplore.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="81" facs="unknown:036127_0293_1008387F2B7F6BF8"/>On the ſight of Ellen, all the poor ſufferers gathered around her. The old woman graſped her hand; the children caught hold of her clothes; the mother pointed to her ruined cottage, and then to her infants. The appeal was irreſiſtable. There was no need of language. The note of ſupplication is the ſame in all. Ellen's heart was ever reſponſive to its cry. She returned the preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the old woman's hand; ſhe embraced the children; ſhe took out her purſe; it contained not much; for the ſupplies of Sir William were no longer regular. But happily much was not wanted. The ruin, it is true, was complete; but the means of recovery were not very extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Ellen gave all ſhe had. It appeared a mine of wealth to the receivers: and their ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions of gratitude were more than the feeling heart of Ellen could bear. The bench was gone. But ſhe ſat down on a ſtone: and the younger ſiſter, who was the firſt to obſerve her emotion, ran haſtily to the rivulet, and brought her a little water in a wooden bowl. Ellen drank it; was relieved; and roſe to depart. Again the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude of the now happy family threw them at her feet.</p>
                     <p>At length, eſcaped from theſe, to her, painful effuſions of their feelings, Ellen turned her ſteps homewards with a lightened purſe, but with a heart ten times more lightened. She had not known a ſenſation ſo delightful ſince the day in which ſhe had relieved the diſtreſſes of the grand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of old Deborah.</p>
                     <p>Oh! ſaid ſhe to herſelf, how little do thoſe know of happineſs, who confine it to the grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication of ſelf!</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="unknown:036127_0294_100851ABC3FC4B50"/>Ellen now grew ſo near the time of her con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, that ſhe began earneſtly to wiſh that Sir William would remove from their preſent ſituation. It had been determined that ſhe ſhould lie-in at Vienna; and that from thence, after her recovery, they ſhould proſecute their tour; a tour, which Ellen no longer wiſhed to be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Her wiſhes were fixed on England: and ſhe ſometimes thought, if ſhe might be permit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to return thither, with a healthy baby in her arms, ſhe might ſtill ſecure to herſelf a tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable portion of happineſs.</p>
                     <p>Day after day paſſed away: and Sir William ſtill found new reaſons for continuing where they were: but at length their removal could he delayed no longer, if indeed Ellen was to arrive at Vienna before her lying-in.</p>
                     <p>Sir William had for ſome time paſt ſuſpended the unceaſing attention, which, on their firſt leaving England, he had ſhewn to the perſonal attendants upon Ellen. Her preſent ſervant had lived with her ſince her arrival at Dreſden, and ſhe had no reaſon to wiſh to change her. Two days, however, before the day on which it was now fixed they ſhould leave the village, Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam expreſſed the moſt pointed diſapprobation of her; told of his ſuſpicions of her honeſty; complained of her impertinence; and deſired Ellen would diſmiſs her.</p>
                     <p>Ellen could not help a little remonſtrating againſt a requeſt, the compliance with which would expoſe her to all the fatigues and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veniencies of a long journey in her preſent help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs circumſtances, without the aſſiſtance ſhe had been ſo long accuſtomed to: and ſhe propoſed
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:036127_0295_100851AD4B67FBA0"/>
that ſhe might be allowed to retain her ſervant until her arrival at Vienna, when ſhe ſaid ſhe would willingly diſcharge her. Sir William urged her immediate diſmiſſion: and whatever were the inconveniencies that Ellen might fear from it, ſhe thought them leſs than thoſe which attended a conteſt with Sir William. She there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore acquieſced: and Sir William promiſed to ſeek out ſome peaſant's daughter, who might accompany them on their journey, and continue with Ellen until ſhe could find ſomebody more to her mind at Vienna.</p>
                     <p>Fortunately his enquiries were anſwered by a young perſon who was juſt returning from ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice at Dreſden: and ſhe willingly conſented to attend upon Ellen as long as ſhe wiſhed her to do ſo. The caprice which Sir William mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſted in theſe particulars, was not confined to the attendants upon Ellen. He had repeatedly parted with his own perſonal ſervants: and at this time their whole ſuite conſiſted of the newly hired Saxon girl and one footman.</p>
                     <p>'We will eſtabliſh ourſelves comfortably at Vienna,' ſaid Sir William. 'Already we have a good houſe taken there: and I have deſired a female friend of mine to hire us ſervants. I will now add to the liſt a femme de chambre for you.'</p>
                     <p>'My dear Sir William,' ſaid Ellen preſſing his hand, 'how happy ſhould I be, if you would realize your words—if <hi>indeed</hi> we might have a comfortable eſtabliſhment <hi>any where.</hi> Long have we wanted it: and yet every comfort and every happineſs ſeem to be in our power.'</p>
                     <p>'Be ſatisfied,' ſaid Sir William. 'All will ſoon be as it ought to be.'</p>

                     <p>THE road from the village where Sir Willi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>am and Ellen then were, to the great road which leads from Dreſden to Prague, was intri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate, and in ſome degree difficult: but Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam relied on his knowledge of the country; and undertook to inſtruct the drivers of the carriage the beſt and ſafeſt way.</p>
                     <p>They left the village early in the morning; and hoped to be able to reach a tolerable good inn on the direct road from Dreſden to Prague before a late hour at night. But either Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam deceived himſelf in the degree of informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he poſſeſſed, or he never ſeriouſly intended to arrive at the ſpot marked out.</p>
                     <p>The day's journey was fatiguing, the roads rugged, often alarming, and they found them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, at the cloſe of night, entering into a thick foreſt, which by no means anſwered the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription that had been given of any of the en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>virons of the place they had been directed to.</p>
                     <p>Ellen, who ſeldom felt vain or unfounded fear, was more fatigued than alarmed. She did not think any danger threatened her: but ſhe
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:036127_0297_100851B1CF268658"/>
felt her ſtrength ſo much exhauſted, that ſhe apprehended ſhe ſhould not be able to ſupport herſelf much longer.</p>
                     <p>Sir William expreſſed a very lively compaſſion for her ſituation; and endeavoured by <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> and ſpirits. The gloom of the foreſt and the darkneſs of the night made it hazardous to at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt finding a road through the wood. Yet there ſeemed to be no alternative, except the remaining where they were in the carriage all night. Ellen propoſed this: but Sir William en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging her with the hopes that this <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

                     <p>They proceeded very proſperouſly for ſome time; and had begun to hope that even ſhould they not find any houſe, they might at leaſt be able, without accident, to penetrate thro' the foreſt. But at the moment they indulged theſe hopes, the poſtillion, not able to ſee the track, drove over a fallen tree that lay on one ſide of it, and overturned the carriage.</p>
                     <p>Sir William was ſupporting Ellen in his arms at the inſtant the accident happened; and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily contrived ſo to break the ſhock of the fall to her, that ſhe received no material injury. It was, however, from the darkneſs of the night, and the poſition of the carriage, with difficulty <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The carriage was broken: and to have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to mend it in the preſent darkneſs would have been a fruitleſs labour. It rained h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ily: and Ellen was wholly unable to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecute her journey on foot, when every ſtep ſhe took might lead her ſtill farther from her way, and from every neceſſary aſſiſtance. To ſtay where they were, without ſhelter, chilled with cold, and drenched in rain, with no reſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing-place but the wet ground, ſeemed to threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en the moſt fatal conſequences to Ellen.</p>
                     <p>Sir William appeared half diſtracted, repeat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing every moment, 'Good God! what have I done?' The ſervants exclaimed, 'What ſhall we do?' The poor Saxon girl wept bitterly: and Ellen, when a little recovered from the firſt ſhock, ſeemed the only perſon capable of a ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional thought.</p>
                     <p>'I cannot ſtand,' ſaid ſhe, almoſt ſinking from Sir William's arms as ſhe ſpoke. 'But if you can contrive to get at the little ſeat on which I reſted my feet in the carriage, I can ſit here 'till the poſtillions have a little aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained where we are. If this is really the fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt you take it for, we cannot be far from the hunting box you have deſcribed; from thence we may poſſibly procure light, and ſuch aſſiſtance, as will enable us either to remove thi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, or ſo to raiſe the carriage, that we may remain ſafe and ſheltered from the weather the remainder of the night.</p>
                     <p>Sir William preſſed her tenderly to his heart, as if at once to thank her for her calmneſs and reſolution, and to re-animate his own.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="87" facs="unknown:036127_0299_100851B94BF33058"/>The ſeat was ſoon found: and Sir William placing Ellen in it, knelt behind her and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported her in his arms. He then gave orders for one of the poſtillions and his own ſervant to purſue the track they were in, which, he ſaid, if he were right in his conjectures concerning the place, muſt bring them in leſs than a mile to the ſpot he had mentioned. There they had only to mention his name, and tell his diſtreſs; and he was aſſured of every aſſiſtance that could be given.</p>
                     <p>The ſervants were abſent nearly an hour: and Ellen was ſo much overcome by fatigue, the beat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the rain, and above all by the uncommon kind of diſtreſs that ſeemed to have ſeized Sir William—for as he joined his face to hers, ſhe felt his tears trickle down her cheeks—that when they returned, ſhe had ſcarcely power to benefit by the aſſiſtance they brought.</p>
                     <p>The moſt cheering part of this aſſiſtance was light. But that which afforded the moſt eſſential ſervice was a ſmall tilted cart, the bottom of which was well covered with ſtraw. Upon this, Sir William contrived to place the cuſhions of the carriage, ſo as to form a tolerable bed: and having, by the help of the light, been enabled to get at a box of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ordials, he made Ellen take ſome of them; and then with the aſſiſtance of the ſervants eaſily lifted her into the cart: here he alſo placed the maid ſervant, who, ſhivering, wet and crying, made a moſt deplorable figure. The trunk that contained the night clothes fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed her with a ſeat: and Sir William, making one of the men who had come from the houſe, lead the way with the lanthern, he himſelf
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:036127_0300_100851BAD4431688"/>
mounting one of the chaiſe horſes, accompanied the cavalcade by the ſide of the cart.</p>
                     <p>In this manner, they proceeded rather more than a mile; and reached the houſe without any new accident, and with little farther incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience.</p>
                     <p>The firſt object was to change Ellen's clothes, and put her to bed: and when this was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed, Sir William made her take ſuch refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments as could be procured; and then left her in the hope that ſhe would repoſe.</p>
                     <p>Nor was his hope vain. Worn out with fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue, ſhe ſoon dropped aſleep; and after ſome hours of reſt, awoke much recruited.</p>
                     <p>Sir William appeared extremely pleaſed, when <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

He propoſed to continue where they were, through the day, both becauſe it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary the carriage ſhould be repaired, and as a farther refreſhment to Ellen.</p>
                     <p>Towards the evening of the day, Sir William told her, that he had indeed widely miſtaken the way he meant to have taken; and that he found he had wandered very diſtant from that which led into the public road to Prague: but that the miſtake had brought him ſo near the manſion of an old friend, that, except for the inconvenience that had occurred to her, he could not lament it.</p>
                     <p>He then mentioned the name of a lady, with whoſe ſon Ellen knew he had formerly been extremely connected: and he ſpoke in the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt terms of the hoſpitality and kindneſs which ſhe had always ſhewn him.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="89" facs="unknown:036127_0301_100851BF4EA12DA0"/>'We are not more than ſix miles from her houſe,' ſaid he: 'and I ſhould never forgive myſelf, if I were to be ſo near without paying my reſpects to her. The carriage is now mend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: we will go together: ſhe will he delighted to ſee you: and I ſhall be ſurpriſed, from what I know of her character, if ſhe does not offer you an aſylum with her, till you are in a fitter ſtate to undertake a long journey. The misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes of yeſterday have made me a coward. When I think of the length of the travel that is before you, I tremble for the conſequences.'</p>
                     <p>Ellen declared herſelf very able to proſecute her journey to Vienna; and avowed the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence ſhe ſhould give being in a houſe of her own, during her confinement, to any accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, however comfortable, that might be af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded her in another.</p>
                     <p>'Well, we need not ſettle this now,' ſaid Sir William. 'We will act as we ſee occaſion. This night, at leaſt, we will paſs with my old friend. But can you diſpenſe with the atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance of your maid? I never ſaw ſuch a fool. She blubbers and ſhivers yet. I ſhould be very glad to exclude her from the party, and for one night—'</p>
                     <p>'Oh! I can do very well without her,' inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted Ellen: 'and indeed I ſhall be glad to ſave her any farther fatigue for a few hours. She has reaſon for her tears. She is extremely bruiſed and hurt; and is ſo ſtiff with the cold ſhe caught laſt night, that ſhe can hardly move. I ſhall deſire that ſhe go to bed, and continue there till we rejoin her at this place to-morrow.'</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="90" facs="unknown:036127_0302_100851C2775E8F80"/>All this being arranged, Sir William and Ellen began their little journey. But it ſeemed as if Sir William was doomed to be convicted of ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance whenever he boaſted of his knowledge of the country. The ſix miles ſeemed to be lengthened into twice that number: and it was already nearly dark, and yet there was no ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of the habitation to which they were going.</p>
                     <p>'Surely you cannot be again miſtaken,' ſaid Ellen. 'I ſhould be ſorry to paſs ſuch another night as the laſt.'</p>
                     <p>'There is no miſtake this time,' returned Sir William rather peeviſhly, 'nor any danger.'</p>
                     <p>'But ſurely we muſt have come much more than ſix miles.'</p>
                     <p>'Don't you ſee the roads are bad and tedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?'</p>
                     <p>'I fear arriving at an unſeaſonable hour, and that your old friend, though glad to ſee us, may be put to ſome inconvenience.'</p>
                     <p>'I never knew women direct their fears aright. I intreat you not to perplex yourſelf with what does not concern you.'</p>
                     <p>Ellen remained ſilent and ſad. The deep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning ſhades of night added to the uneaſineſs of her ſenſations: and a confuſed apprehenſion of, ſhe hardly knew what, ſtole over her mind. At length they arrived at the top of a long avenue: and Sir William calling haſtily to the man to ſtop, 'This,' ſaid he to Ellen, 'is the place. I will get out, and announce our arrival before the carriage can be heard at the houſe; leſt our appearance at ſo late an hour may alarm the old lady.

                     <p>So ſaying, Sir William jumped out of the carriage, and left Ellen, wondering, diſturbed, and unhappy. The ſervants obeyed the direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions given, and in about the time preſcribed followed Sir William.</p>

                     <p>THE avenue was cloſed at the other end by a large pair of gates, which opened into a court ſurrounded by buildings. The gates they found open, and were directed, by a light immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately oppoſite, to drive up to the door of the houſe. Here they found Sir William.</p>
                     <p>'We are extremely unlucky,' ſaid he as he opened the chaiſe door, and aſſiſted Ellen to get out. 'My old friend has ſpent the winter at Prague, a thing ſhe never did when I knew her: and ſhe is not yet returned.'</p>
                     <p>'Then,' ſaid Ellen, ſhrinking back, 'let us return. The night is fine: and now we kn<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>
                        <pb n="93" facs="unknown:036127_0305_100851CD392F7B08"/>'That's a reproach I hardly deſerve,' ſaid El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len ſmiling. 'But be it as you will.'</p>
                     <p>She then entered the door, which opened into a long and narrow paſſage, and in which there was no other light than that which Sir William held in his hand. He led the way: and they ſoon found themſelves in a hall, not very ſpacious but very gloomy. Here they were met by a reſpectable looking perſon, who had alſo a light in her hand. She was a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man of about fifty, and ſeemed to regard El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len with looks of the moſt ſcrutinizing curio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity.</p>
                     <p>'That's my old friend the houſekeeper,' ſaid Sir William: 'and ſhe aſſures me her lady would never forgive her, if ſhe were to turn us from her doors at this time of night.'</p>
                     <p>Ellen was going to make her acknowledge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, in French: but Sir William ſaid, 'You may ſpare your civilities; for the old dame un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtands not a word of any language, but her native German.'</p>
                     <p>'Upon how many occaſions lately,' exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Ellen, 'have I had reaſon to regret my igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of that language!' Then from a ſudden feeling, that this might ſound as a taunt to Sir William, who had refuſed her permiſſion to learn it, ſhe added, 'but all cauſe for regret will ſoon be over. Once returned to dear England, and I hope we ſhall ſpeak only Engliſh for the reſt of our lives.'</p>
                     <p>As ſhe ſaid this, the light that the woman h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ld fell full on the face of Sir Willian, and Ellen ſaw with ſurpriſe the ſudden alteration of his countenance. He caſt up his eyes, with a look
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:036127_0306_100851CEC5644790"/>
almoſt of horror, and repeated, 'Once returned to England!'</p>
                     <p>Ellen took hold of his arm, and perceived it trembled. But at this moment their attendant opened a door; and they entered a large and to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lerably furniſhed parlour, where there was a bla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing wood fire, and two lighted candles placed on a table before it.</p>
                     <p>The ſervants ſaid ſomething to Sir William, to which he gave an anſwer apparently of aſſent. She went out: and Sir William giving Ellen a chair, threw himſelf into another, and ſeemed loſt in thought.</p>
                     <p>Ellen regarded him with ſurpriſe for a few moments; and at length ventured to ſay, 'are you not well?'</p>
                     <p>At the ſound of her voice, Sir William ſtar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from his reverie; and ſaid, 'Well? yes, very well, I believe: but I am hungry. Our old lady has promiſed us ſome ſupper. I care not how ſoon ſhe keeps her word.'</p>
                     <p>Then endeavouring to appear in ſpirits, he would have rallied Ellen on the apprehenſions he ſaid ſhe betrayed on the road. But his cheer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs was evidently forced: and, before the ſervant returned, Sir William had again ſunk into thoughtfulneſs.</p>
                     <p>It was not long before the houſekeeper made her appearance, accompanied by another female with preparations for ſupper: and preſently after, the ſupper was on the table</p>
                     <p>The meal, for which Sir William had expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed ſo much deſire, was not reliſhed by him in a manner that juſtified the impatience he had ſhewn for its appearance. Ellen preſſed him to
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:036127_0307_100851D1E7884128"/>
eat, and, yielding to her intreaties, he took ſome fowl on his plate: but Ellen obſerved, that the moment her eye was withdrawn, he ſeemed to forget that it was there; and fixed a melancholy and diſturbed look upon her.</p>
                     <p>In making theſe obſervations, Ellen loſt all appetite alſo; and the ſupper was ſerved and ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away without having been much diminiſhed by either.</p>
                     <p>When the ſervants were gone, Sir William ſhivering, drew his chair near the fire.</p>
                     <p>'I am ſure you are unwell,' ſaid Ellen anxi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly. 'It is hardly poſſible you ſhould have been expoſed ſo many hours to ſuch weather as we were out in laſt night, with impuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Do you think Madam Houſekeeper has no family medicine that might be of ſervice to you? ſomething that would make you perſpire might remove all your complaints before morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing?'</p>
                     <p>Sir William ſeemed not to hear her: and the ſhuddering with which he was ſeized, had more the appearance of proceeding from emotion, than from cold. Ellen felt dreadfully alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. She took his hand, but dropped it ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently, ſtartled with the burning heat which it communicated to her own. 'You are feveriſh —you are ill—for God's ſake let us inquire what there is in the houſe that it will be proper for you to take.'</p>

                     <p>'What are you about? and where would you go?'</p>
                     <p>'I am going to ſeek the houſekeeper. I hope ſhe will be able to furniſh me with ſomething that will be of ſervice to you.'</p>
                     <p>'And if you ſpeak to her, ſhe will not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand you.—It is true, I am not well. I ſhiver; I burn; I have an intenſe head-ach, the effects all of a violent cold. Something to make me preſpire, and a good night's reſt, will ſet all to rights.'</p>
                     <p>'God grant it!' ſaid Ellen fervently.</p>
                     <p>'There's no doubt,' ſaid Sir William, as he went out of the room.</p>
                     <p>He was abſent nearly a quarter of an hour, which ſeemed almoſt an age to Ellen. When he returned, his looks were compoſed, and his air ſomewhat more cheerful. He was followed by the ſervant they had firſt ſeen, who had a bowl in her hand.</p>
                     <p>'Our good friend there,' ſaid Sir William, with a melancholy ſmile, 'has made me a mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture which ſhe ſays is ſovereign for a cold. She has alſo prepared me a bed apart from yours, leſt I ſhould diſturb you. I will drink your health, and then let us retire to our rooms.' He took the bowl. He fixed his eyes intently on Ellen for a moment, 'Good night, <hi>God bleſs you,</hi>' ſaid he, with an emphaſis; and raiſing the bowl to his mouth, he drank off the contents. But Ellen perceived that he turned deadly p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

croſſed the mind of Ellen, which ſhe durſt not ſuffer to harbour there for a moment.</p>
                     <p>'Will not you have ſomething warm?' ſaid Sir William, 'ſome negus? or whey? I did not offer you any of my potion; for though it may be ſalutary, it was nauſeous.'</p>
                     <p>'I think I will,' returned Ellen: 'I am cold myſelf. I ſhould be glad of any thing warm.'</p>
                     <p>Sir William ſpoke to the woman, who inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly withdrew: and Sir William, taking Ellen's hand, drew her towards the fire, 'You look uneaſy; you look frightened; I aſſure you my indiſpoſition is trifling. I ſhall be well to-mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row: and then you will wonder how you came to be ſo much alarmed. You ſay <hi>you</hi> are cold,' added he: 'for <hi>once</hi> let the arms of a huſband warm you.'</p>
                     <p>He ſnatched her to his heart, and held her there for a moment. Then letting her go, as the door opened, 'Oh! Ellen!' ſaid he, 'why not thus for ever!'</p>
                     <p>'For God's ſake, tell me what all this means. Either you or I are ſtrangely diſordered.'</p>
                     <p>'Means!—It means juſtice—but come, we will talk it all over to-morrow.' Then taking a bowl from the ſervant, who had juſt preſented it to Ellen—he put it to his lips, and aſſuming a cheerful look, 'Excellent white wine whey, I aſſure you, much better than mine. Now drink my health.'</p>
                     <p>'Heaven is my witneſs, how ſincerely I do,' ſaid Ellen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'and taking the bowl, ſhe drank a part of what it contained. It appeared to her what Sir William had ſaid it was, except that

                     <p>'No, no, that muſt not be. You had too diſturbed a night laſt night, to become a watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er this. I ſhall want no attendants: but if it will make you eaſy, James ſhall ſit up an hour or two in my room: and when I am aſleep, he ſhall let you know.'</p>
                     <p>Ellen joyfully accepted this offer: and ſtretch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Yet he ſpoke cheerfully and with uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern: 'Pray lend me your watch. Mine has been ſpoilt in laſt night's overthrow, and does not go.'</p>
                     <p>Ellen gave him her watch; and again bade him good night. He followed her to the door of the room, as if unwilling to loſe ſight of her; and as he turned from her, ſhe heard him ſigh deeply.</p>
                     <p>Ellen, following her conductor, croſſed the hall, from the upper end of which went a pair of ſtairs that led to a gallery above, in which were ſeveral doors. The woman opened the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond, on the left hand: and Ellen found herſelf in a ſpacious room, the modern furniture of
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:036127_0311_100851DD4FFD5688"/>
which ſomewhat ſurpriſed her. Around the fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>place, which was well ſupplied with fire, were arranged her night dreſs, and every thing ſhe could require, in the niceſt order. The woman opened a door on one ſide of the room, which Ellen ſaw was deſigned for her bedchamber. This alſo had a fire in it, and ſeemed to be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided with every comfort, and with many of thoſe accommodations Ellen could not have ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected to have found in the apartment of an old Bohem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Her attendant offered her ſervice to aſſiſt in undreſſing her: and Ellen, harraſſed in mind and body, was willing to take off a part of her clothes, and put on her dreſſing gown. But ſhe meant not to go to bed, until ſhe had heard ſomething more of Sir William: and ſhe now felt the moſt tormenting perplexity from not being able to explain herſelf to her companion, who ſeemed reſolved not to leave her 'till ſhe had ſeen her in bed.</p>
                     <p>At length it occurred to her, that ſhe might eaſily make her comprehend her wiſh to have a written paper delivered to Sir William: and ſhe wrote theſe words with a pencil:—</p>
                     <p>'Pray inform my too civil attendant, that I wiſh her to leave me alone: and be ſo kind as to direct her to come to me as ſoon as James can inform her that you are aſleep.'</p>
                     <p>The woman readily underſtood what ſhe was to do with the paper. She took it, and in a few moments returned with theſe words from Sir William.</p>
                     <p>'If you have any regard for my health, let the old lady ſee you in bed. I promiſe you
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:036127_0312_100851E082461F70"/>
ſhe ſhall bring you good news of me in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence. But if you are left to yourſelf, I know you will ſit up all night: and this thought will keep me waking.'</p>
                     <p>Ellen in return wrote, 'I acquieſce: but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member your promiſe.'</p>
                     <p>She then ſuffered her attendant to aſſiſt her in going to bed. She made the woman under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand that ſhe wiſhed to have a light: and this being procured, the woman drew the curtains and left her.</p>
                     <p>Ellen in her own mind, was confident that ſhe ſhould not cloſe her eyes, until ſhe had heard from Sir William, ſuch an impreſſion had his apparent indiſpoſition both of body and mind made upon her. But her head was ſcarcely laid upon her pillow, before ſhe fell into a ſleep pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found as death.</p>
                     <p>She awoke from this ſleep with a ſudden ſtart, ſuppoſing that drowſineſs had only for a few moments overcome her. But, ſurpriſed by the kind of light that ſhe ſaw in her room, which ſhe thought could proceed from neither fire nor candle, ſhe haſtily undrew the curtain; and was amazed and chagrined to find a meridian ſun ſhining full upon her bed. She roſe haſtily; and wrapping a few clothes around her, opened the door which led into the next room, deſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to go from thence to the gallery to ſee for ſomebody, of whom ſhe could make inquiries after Sir William. On opening the door, ſhe found in the adjoining room, as if in waiting, the woman who had attended her the night before.</p>

name, when the woman delivered her a ſealed letter, the direction of which ſhe ſaw was in his hand. On the ſight of this letter, her heart ſunk within her, as if it foretold all ſhe had to ſuffer. Yet at the moment ſhe thought not of herſelf. She was ſeized with an univerſal trembling. The letter dropt from her hand: and ſhe ſunk almoſt ſenſeleſs into a chair. Yet how wide were her apprehenſions from the truth! —For Sir William ſhe only feared: and yet Sir William, withheld by no compaſſionate conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for her, was at this moment conſummating that vengeance for imagined crimes, which he had been ſo many months in preparing with the cooleſt deliberation.</p>
                     <p>The woman, as if ſhe had expected the effect that even the ſight of the letter would have, ran readily to the aſſiſtance of Ellen; poured drops and water down her throat; gave her air; and ſeemed, by the tone of her voice, to exhort her to patience.</p>
                     <p>Ellen, whoſe mind was fixed wholly upon the draught that ſhe had ſeen Sir William ſwallow the night before, and now convinced that the ſoundneſs of her ſleep had been procured by me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicine, could think only of one cataſtrophe; and regarding the letter with horror, had not courage to open it. The woman took it from the floor; preſented it to her; and ſeemed to intreat her to read it.</p>
                     <p>Confuſed and overwhelmed as Ellen's mind was, there ſeemed to her ſomething in this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the woman's, which ſpoke the evil not to be ſo bad as ſhe feared. She took the letter, ſhe broke the ſeal—and, in the relief from the
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:036127_0314_100851E697419918"/>
horror which at had firſt ſeized her, forgot for a few moments the extent of that miſery which was announced to herſelf. The letter was as follows:</p>
                     <p>'Summon to your ſupport all that ſtrength of mind, which has ſo often given me cauſe to admire you. Oh! Ellen, had it been uniform, had it ſprung from principle!—But away with every vain regret. Where the guilt is certain, all compunction for the puniſhment ſhould ceaſe: and if the chaſtiſement is heavy, you will not affirm it is diſproportionate to the crime. It would, however, be uſeleſs to reproach you. My injured love, my violated honor, cannot ſpeak more ſeverely than will your own heart: and in guarding myſelf from the poſſibility of being again deceived, I wiſh not to inflict any unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary rigour.</p>
                     <p>'When you know, that I was appriſed, by the conviction of my own ſenſes, of the laſt viſit you received from your undoer—when you are told that I read the invitation for a repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his viſit under ſuch forms as would elude ſuſpicion and lay jealouſy to ſleep—you will not wonder, that in a cauſe which would not admit of doubt, I have thought all explanation unneceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; or that being convinced of having been once betrayed, I reſolved upon ſuch meaſures, as would ſecure me from the poſſibility of a ſecond inſult.</p>
                     <p>'In knowing that I never poſſeſſed your heart, I ought, perhaps, to have foreſeen all that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed. But, deceived by the appearance of an integrity and candour, which, unſupported as they were by reality, will remain, I confidently
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:036127_0315_100851E927FC01F8"/>
believe, unparalleled, the warnings of my reaſon were unheard, and the miſgivings of my mind were diſregarded.</p>
                     <p>'How often has the ſemblance of a ſincerity, which, had it been genuine, angels might have copied with advantage, baffled the precautions of prudence, and ſuſpended the rod of juſtice? But the veil is now fallen: and even you can elude no longer. Here then let all retroſpect end.</p>
                     <p>'You need not be told, how a huſband ought to feel and act on ſuch a diſcovery. Yet the agonies you witneſſed in me this night, with ſo much alarm, may ſhew you, that I am not yet free from that weakneſs, which has ſo long enabled you to deceive me. It may ſhew you, that the meaſures which juſtice and honor de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded from me, are not purſued without a torture of mind equal to any I can inflict upon you. If this conviction can lighten the deſtiny which from henceforward awaits you, I grudge you not ſuch an alleviation, poor, undone, miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable wretch as you are!</p>
                     <p>'Again I entreat you to collect every power of your mind. Conſider, it is no ſingle life that is at ſtake. Suffer not any extravagance of grief, any exceſs of deſpair, to hazard an exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, which you cannot believe you have a right to diſpoſe of. Take pity alſo on yourſelf. If you would preſerve one ray of hope to gild your future life, deſtroy not, by any extravagance of grief in the preſent moment, the only ſource from which it can proceed.</p>
                     <p>'I expect not that a creature which muſt par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of my nature ſhall be dear to you, as was
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:036127_0316_100851EAB1657648"/>
that cheriſhed darling in which I had no part. But if it be mine, it is alſo yours. Let that conſideration make it an object of your care; and add not the guilt of murder to thoſe other crimes which ſo deeply ſtain your conſcience.</p>
                     <p>'This is not the upbraiding of reſentment. It is the warning of friendſhip. Take it as ſuch: and may you be enabled to endure, with tole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable moderation, the ſeverity of a puniſhment, the juſtice of which you will not diſpute. Know, then, you will never henceforward go beyond the boundaries of that habitation in which you are now placed. But every comfort, and every accommodation, and every amuſement which your ſituation will admit, will await you there.</p>
                     <p>'You will ſee the neceſſity I have been under of depriving you of the ſolace of converſation, and of leaving you deſtitute of all property. Devoid of all means of influencing the feelings, or of bribing the avarice of your attendants, I have ſecured, beyond a fear, your perpetual im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment: and I have, by cutting off from you all hope of eſcape, preſerved you from the continual irritation which muſt have attended any attempt for that purpoſe, which, even in circumſtances more favorable to ſucceſs, ſuch is the extent of the precaution I have taken, would certainly have ended in diſappointment: nor in ſuch a caſe would diſappointment be all that you would incur. Neceſſity would then induce a much more rigorous confinement, an infinitely ſeverer reſtraint.</p>
                     <p>'When you reflect how much it imports me to perpetuate a confinement which I have once begun, you will not doubt but that I have taken
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:036127_0317_100851EEA8187338"/>
the precautions I ſpeak of, nor the conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to yourſelf ſhould you endeavour to elude them. Although unable to converſe with you, you will find your attendants always reſpectful, attentive, and ready to adminiſter to your wants. You will be regularly ſupplied with accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of every kind: and if it ſhould ſo happen that my attention on this head does not fulfil your wiſhes, you have only to write down in French any thing that you may wiſh to be ſupplied with, and you ſhall obtain all you deſire. Books, muſical inſtruments, or materials for work, or drawing, I include in this permiſſion. But you will find vain any attempt to convey a letter, even to me. Never, Oh! never, will I renew an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe which has coſt me ſo much. Could I doubt, I would hear you. But, if juſtice cannot make me happy, neither ſhall a weak compaſſion increaſe my miſery. Reſolved to puniſh, I am henceforth deaf to the voice of penitence: and deſiring to love no longer, I ſeek only forgetful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs!—In the hour of pain and danger, which now draws ſo near, you will have every aſſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance you can poſſibly deſire: and you will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive in a very few days every neceſſary prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratory to that time, which either yourſelf or your infant can want.</p>
                     <p>'And now, moſt guilty and unfortunate Ellen, what more can I add?—To my regrets and my good wiſhes you are probably alike in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenſible: nor can I expect that my admonitions will prevail, where conſiderations of ſo much more importance have failed to have their due effect. But if it were poſſible that you ſhould at laſt be wiſe, if by taking your puniſhment
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:036127_0318_100851F041DEF930"/>
with patience, you make the beſt of the time which is yet allotted you for penitence, and thus make all the amends in your power for the evils you have occaſioned, you will fulfil all the wiſhes and gratify all the deſires which yet remain in the breaſt of your injured huſband.'</p>

                     <p>ELLEN read this letter with an aſtoniſhment which ſuſpended for a time all powers of recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection or feeling. She could neither believe nor comprehend what ſhe read. Never once had the idea that Sir William ſuſpected her of guilt beyond the eſtrangement of her affections, croſſed her mind; nor could the evidence of her ſenſes now convince her that ſhe was judged, condemn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and puniſhed unheard.</p>
                     <p>'Where is Sir William?' cried ſhe, ruſhing to the door, forgetful that ſhe ſpoke to thoſe who underſtood her not, and thoughtleſs of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order of her dreſs.</p>
                     <p>The woman miſtook this motion for an attempt to eſcape; and, placing herſelf between Ellen and the door, endeavoured, though with reſpect and gentleneſs, to detain her.</p>
                     <p>'Let me go,' ſaid Ellen ſtruggling. 'Let me ſee Sir William. I implore you, let me ſee Sir William.</p>

from her attendant, a ſudden recollection ſtruck Ellen.—She remembered that ſhe ſpoke in vain, and that her preſent efforts were probably miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>underſtood. Again ſhe read the letter: but ſhe read it with nearly as little comprehenſion of the contents as before.</p>
                     <p>Totally ignorant of the circumſtances on which ſhe had been condemned, and ſure of her own innocence, ſhe could not believe that Sir William could think her guilty. She could not believe that, unheard, he could puniſh her as guilty.</p>
                     <p>As ſhe continued to read, ſhe looked for ſome hidden ſenſe in words, which ſhe could not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive to be uſed in that which was obvious. When ſhe came to the expreſſion, 'From hence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward, you will never go beyond the bounda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the habitation in which you are now placed,' ſhe looked towards the high windows, and around the room, with an air at once wild and thoughtful. Then covering her face with her hands, ſhe endeavoured to collect her ſenſes, and be aſſured that ſhe did not dream.</p>
                     <p>Again ſhe turned to peruſe the letter, and to weigh every ſyllable of it. But ſhe had read it many times, before ſhe was able to give it cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit as a reality, or was awakened to a full ſence of her true ſituation. At length, convinced that Sir William was gone, and that he had conſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her to perpetual impriſonment, ſhe reſted perſuaded that her caſe was as hopeleſs as it was miſerable</p>
                     <p>But even under this overwhelming conviction, Ellen did not forſake herſelf. She need<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

violence. Stunned rather than rouſed, afflicted rather than irritated, the firſt recollection of her real ſituation, which was ſufficiently perfect t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> form any reſolution upon, was followed by a determination to do nothing which could be injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to her child, or diſagreeable to herſelf. But it was not on her own ſtrength that ſhe relied for power to bear up under ſuch a load of hopeleſs miſery.</p>
                     <p>The woman who had remained an attentive but forgotten ſpectator of all her movements, ſaw her with ſurpriſe riſe from her chair, with an air of dignified humility, and proſtrating herſelf up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her knees, continue for ſome moments in fervent prayer.</p>
                     <p>When ſhe aroſe, ſhe caſt her eyes upon the woman, and appeared to ſee her for the firſt time. She advanced towards her; and with a mild and complacent aſpect held out her hand towards her; ſeeming by this action to beſpeak her friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and to declare her own ſubmiſſion. The woman, ſtruck and moved by her manner and look, could not forbear raiſing the hand that was offered her to her lips, and then immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly preſented her with ſome of her cloths, endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to make her underſtand, how ready ſhe ſhould be to ſerve her. From this moment, it it ſeemed as if a treaty of amity was ſealed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween them: and Ellen felt ſomething like hope revive in her boſom.</p>
                     <p>When Ellen was dreſſed, her attendant opened the door of a room which was oppoſite to the one that led to the bed chamber; and invited Ellen to enter it. Ellen found this room much larger than either the dreſſing-room or bed-cham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber;
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:036127_0322_100851FCD84C4A88"/>
and caſting her eyes round it, ſaw in the manner in which it was furniſhed, a ſad certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the intended length of her captivity.</p>
                     <p>Two book-caſes, which, with the books they contained, ſeemed to be new, and recently put up, filled the large receſſes on each ſide of the fire. A harpſichord, which alſo appeared to be new, ſtood on the one ſide of the room: near it was placed a harp. A writing table, furniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with all the materials neceſſary for writing, ſtood near the fire. A ſofa, and one or two chairs, of different forms and dimenſions, with two more tables, made up the furniture. The room was fitted up with ſtriped linen: and there ſeemed diffuſed over the whole an air of cheerfulneſs which ſuited ill with the ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Ellen's ſoul. Hitherto ſhe had not ſhed a tear. On beholding an apartment ſo evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently prepared for her ſolitary priſon, ſhe burſt into a paſſion of weeping, and threw herſelf on the ſofa, in an agony of mind not to be deſcribed.</p>
                     <p>The calmneſs which ſhe had hitherto preſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, aroſe more from the ſtunning nature of the blow ſhe had received, and the natural temper and acquired habits of her mind, than from any fortitude that ſhe had yet been able to aſſume upon the preſent occaſion. Suddenly and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtably the recollection of Engliſh friends and Engliſh joys ruſhed upon her heart, and the ſenſe of their miſery in the loſs of her, and of her's in the loſs of them, formed a mingled torture of ſo acute a kind, as for a time overcame all her ſenſe of the duty of reſignation, and all her fears for the ſafety of her child. Agitated by convulſive twitchings, almoſt choaked by her
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:036127_0323_100851FFDB129E48"/>
riſing ſobs, ſhe lay for ſome in a ſtate of the moſt alarming diſorder.</p>
                     <p>Her new friend, not more terrified than griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for the ſituation in which ſhe ſaw her, ming<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led ſo much genuine compaſſion in her attempts to relieve and calm her, that Ellen, upon whom the voice of kindneſs was never loſt, and whom death alone could hold long inſenſible to the emotions of gratitude, began, in pity to what another felt, to ſtill the loud complainings of her own affliction.</p>
                     <p>She became compoſed and ſilent; patiently took what was offered her; and returning after ſome interval to perfect calmneſs, ſhe ſhewed ſo earneſt a deſire to be left alone, that the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſionate Mrs. Ulric at length complied.</p>
                     <p>Ellen, left to herſelf, wept without reſtraint and without meaſure: and this free indulgence of nature ſaved her overcharged heart from breaking. Her mind glanced hopefully on the compaſſion which ſhe ſaw ſhe had excited in her attendant: and ſhe began to believe it would not be difficult to win her over to her wiſhes.</p>
                     <p>She wiſhed but to be able to write to Sir William, ſecure, could ſhe once induce him to come to an explanation, that ſhe muſt convince him of her innocence. The rigour of his deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings towards her was all founded on error: and hence, thoſe paſſages of his letter which had at firſt given her the moſt poignant diſtreſs, now inſpired her with hope. Were I the vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tim of his hatred, (thought Ellen) no juſtificati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on would avail me. But while I am a ſufferer only from his miſtaken ideas of juſtice, in eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhing my innocence, I ſhall put an end to my

misfortunes. It ſeemed ſo eaſy to prove this innocence to any one with whom ſhe could ſpeak, that the moſt bitter of her regrets at this moment, was her incapacity to converſe with Mrs. Ulric.</p>
                     <p>This tender hearted woman returned in a few hours to Ellen's apartment, bringing with her a nicely prepared meal, of which ſhe preſſed Ellen with ſo much kindneſs to partake, that ſhe could not wholly refuſe her. But Ellen could not eat. Mrs. Ulric, however, induced her to drink a glaſs of wine, and again left her to herſelf.</p>
                     <p>The cloſe of this melancholy day now came on: and from thoſe changes to which the mind in the firſt ſtages of affliction is ſubject, grief ſeemed to return with freſh force, as the ſhades of evening overſpread the apartment; nor was her grief wholly unmixed with a degree of ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror. Frightful images aroſe in her mind: and ſhe ſcarcely dared to truſt herſelf with conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to what ſo violent means as thoſe already taken by Sir William might ultimately lead. But theſe unfounded fears aroſe wholly from the ſhattered ſtate of her nerves. The benevolent countenance of Mrs. Ulric, illuminated by the light of two candles, with which ſhe preſently entered the room, diſſipated them in an inſtant: and Ellen eaſily admitted the folly of tormenting herſelf with imaginary evils, when ſhe had ſo many real ones to deplore.</p>
                     <p>The fatigues which Ellen had undergone for three days, had entirely exhauſted her ſtrength: and ſhe readily yielded to the ſigns by which ſhe underſtood Mrs. Ulric to deſire her to go to
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:036127_0325_100852046D24BF58"/>
bed. When there, wearineſs ſo overcame afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that if ſhe found no refreſhment, ſhe at leaſt received reſt. Her mind was ſo full of her project of making Mrs. Ulric her friend, that, in ſtudying for means to explain herſelf to her, ſhe loſt a part of the ſenſe of what made ſuch an explanation deſirable, She was reſolved, alſo, to endeavour the next morning to inſpect every part of her priſon, both as a matter of curioſity, and as a means to aſcertain what degree of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulgence would be allowed her.</p>
                     <p>Her ſleep as it was broken, ſo it was ſhort. She aroſe early, and looking for her watch, now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected, for the firſt time, by what artifice Sir William had deprived her of it. She eaſily comprehended his reaſon for ſuch a procedure; and was not therefore ſurpriſed upon feeling in her pockets to find her purſe gone, and every trinket, of however trifling a value, except the picture of her father, which was ſet very plainly in gold.</p>
                     <p>On the ſight of a countenance, which never bent its regard towards her but with looks of the fondeſt love, now never more to be beheld by her, her whole frame ſhook with diſorder, and her heart ſwelled almoſt to burſting.</p>
                     <p>'My father,' cried ſhe, and preſſed the picture to her lips. 'My father!' repeated ſhe, 'Now in vain do I call to you for help; now, in my uttermoſt diſtreſs, impotent to ſave?'</p>
                     <p>Deſpair ſtopt her tongue.</p>
                     <p>'Oh! God,' cried ſhe, kneeling down, 'be thou my father. Thou canſt burſt the walls of this priſon. Thou canſt reſtore me to all I hold dear—to reputation, to friendſhip, to happineſs.
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:036127_0326_10085208CC5D0230"/>
Thou canſt do more: thou canſt teach me to endure with patience, perpetual impriſonment, never-ending deprivation. Let it be as thou wilt.'</p>
                     <p>This act of pious reſignation calmed the flur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried paſſions of Ellen. Again ſhe preſſed her father's picture to her lips; and felt an emotion of gratitude to Sir William for having left her ſo precious a relique.</p>

                     <p>WHEN Mrs. Ulric attended, ſhe found Ellen dreſſed, and apparently perfectly compoſed. Mrs. Ulric withdrew with intention of preparing break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt: and Ellen took an accurate ſurvey of her apartments. She found, in addition to the three rooms ſhe had ſeen, two cloſets which belonged to her bed chamber, one dark and the other light. The windows of her bed chamber and dreſſing-room were both too high to allow of any thing being ſeen from thence, except when ſtanding cloſe to them. She ſaw, they looked upon a garden, which, as far as ſhe could diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern, was walled round. Beyond it ſhe could ſee only woods, which appeared to extend far into the country. The windows of the apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which ſeemed to be allotted for her fitting-room, were lower than thoſe in the other rooms; and appeared to have been newly put in. They opened into the court-yard by which ſhe had entered: and as the window of the light cloſet looked out upon the open country, Ellen com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehended that her apartment occupied one entire ſide of the building. The window of this cloſet
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:036127_0328_1008520FE36C4878"/>
was too high to look from, except when ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon a chair, or table; and was ſo ſmall, that Ellen could not have got her head through it. The country which could be ſeen from it, appeared wild and deſolate.</p>
                     <p>Ellen felt it a matter of great importance to herſelf, whether ſhe ſhould be allowed the liberty to paſs beyond this apartment, or whether it was indeed the limits of her confinement. She was reſolved to know.</p>
                     <p>When Mrs. Ulric, who had attended her at breakfaſt, was removing the tea equipage, Ellen aroſe, and went towards the door of her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. Mrs. Ulric inſtantly put down what ſhe had in her hand, opened the door of the room, and ſeemed to invite Ellen to enter the gallery. Ellen complied: and Mrs. Ulric going before her, ſhewed the rooms which were oppoſite thoſe ſhe inhabited. Some of theſe appeared to be occupied by ſervants, and ſome not to be occu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pied at all: and Ellen thought ſhe underſtood that one belonged to Mrs. Ulric. The furniture was ſcanty, and miſerably old, and ill correſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ponded with that which ſhe had ſeen in her own apartment.</p>
                     <p>From the gallery ſhe deſcended to the hall, and the firſt object which caught her eye, was, the door by which ſhe had entered it through the long paſſage that led to the outer court. This was now cloſed, and faſtened by a heavy wooden bar, which was placed acroſs it. She went into the parlour, where ſhe had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the night of her arrival. It was gloomy: and by ſeveral things that lay about, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cluded it was the place where Mrs. Ulric uſually
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:036127_0329_100852116DC41850"/>
ſat. The remembrance how ſhe had been be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trayed into her preſent ſituation, ruſhed power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully on her mind: and ſhe haſtily quitted a place which called to her recollection circumſtances ſhe could not bear to think of.</p>
                     <p>Returning to the hall, ſhe made towards a door, which ſhe then firſt perceived. Mrs. Ulric ſtepping before, ſhewed her it opened into the offices, but directed her attention to one oppoſite. She opened that too, and Ellen found, with great ſatisfaction that it led immediately to the garden. Mrs. Ulric, as if yielding to the deſire which Ellen ſhewed to enter it, made way; and, reſpectfully retiring, ſuffered Ellen to walk out alone.</p>
                     <p>Her heart bounded, when ſhe found ſhe was miſtreſs of ſuch a privilege; and ſhe felt her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf half at liberty. She traverſed the gardens with a kind of wild tumultuous hope of imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate eſcape. But ſhe was ſoon convinced of what indeed her reaſon, if this had been a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment when reaſon could have been attended to, would have told her before, that every avenue was ſecurely cloſed.</p>
                     <p>The garden was ſpacious; and ſeemed to be laid out more for uſe than pleaſure. Yet at the greateſt diſtance from the houſe, there were ſome retired and ſhady places, which would afford no unpleaſant retreat, in ſuch weather as makes the cooler air preferable to the houſe.</p>
                     <p>Many parts of the walls were old: and it appeared as if the new building which connect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them together, did not follow the line of any former wall which might have been deſtroyed. From this circumſtance, Ellen concluded, that
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:036127_0330_10085212F6D86BA8"/>
the compaſs of the garden had been leſſened; at one ſharp angle, however, the meeting lines of which were formed of walls equally old, ſhe diſcovered a ſmall door: it was very maſſive, and, though extremely old, retained great ſtrength: upon it was a lock; but as the faſtening of the door did not ſeem to depend upon that. Ellen tried to ſhake it, but found it perfectly ſteady. As well as ſhe could judge from its poſition, it muſt open immediately upon the country: and poor Ellen ſtood for ſome minutes oppoſite to it, fixed in a deep and melancholy reverie, ſo loſt in thought, that ſhe knew not that it was the hope of eſcape through that door, that wholly abſorbed her faculties.</p>
                     <p>Starting from this temporary ſtupor, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued her ſearch. But finding no other ſpot in the whole circumference of the garden, from which it was poſſible ſhe ſhould eſcape, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned again to the door; again ſurveyed it with the greateſt accuracy; again tried to ſhake it upon its hinges; and again found all her efforts ineffectual.</p>
                     <p>It was impulſe rather than reaſon (as the new-caught bird flutters around its cage) that had occaſioned Ellen to make this ſearch. Had it been attended with the diſcovery of an immediate means of eſcape, Ellen was in no condition to have availed herſelf of it; and muſt have declined, upon reflection, to make uſe of it.</p>
                     <p>Her preſent circumſtances, which made walk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any diſtance impoſſible—her total want of money—her entire ignorance of the language of the country—would have made it madneſs to have attempted an eſcape, while there remained
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:036127_0331_1008521625D009D8"/>
any hope of inducing Sir William to do her juſtice. On winning Mrs. Ulric to her cauſe, ſhe reſted all her real hopes and rational expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations of deliverance: and ſhe determined not to loſe a moment in making the experiment.</p>
                     <p>Being returned to her apartment, ſhe ſat down with the deſign of forming that letter, which ſhe hoped to be able to prevail upon Mrs. Ulric to deliver. But, upon reperuſing Sir William's, to determine upon the beſt manner in which to enter upon her defence, ſhe found herſelf entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at a loſs. The circumſtances on which he grounded her condemnation, were entirely un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to her: and the conviction under which he ſeemed to write, that ſhe muſt herſelf acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge her guilt, as it took away every uncertainty upon which explanation could be founded, ſo it appeared to make all explanation impoſſible.</p>
                     <p>But when ſhe attended to the preciſe act of criminality with which ſhe was charged, in the words, 'I was appriſed, by the evidence of my own ſenſes, of the laſt viſit you received from your undoer,' a ſuſpicion found place in her mind which had not before entered it.</p>
                     <p>Ellen had never ſeen Henry, (for that he was meant by her undoer, ſhe had no doubt) ſince they parted in Devonſhire. He had attended her to her carriage, at the hour of her departure, and he had aſſiſted her into it, in the preſence of Sir William, of ſeveral ſervants, and of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny other people. This attendance could hardly be called a viſit; and if it could, it was not poſſible to fix the ſtain of guilt upon it; nor could it be neceſſary that Sir William ſhould appriſe her, as a piece of of information which
<pb n="120" facs="unknown:036127_0332_1008521BCAFCF918"/>
muſt overwhelm her with ſhame and confuſion, that he had witneſſed it. This ſhe knew well: and ſhe could neither have had the power, nor a motive to conceal it. But as ſhe was perfectly convinced that no ſubſequent interview had taken place between them, and as, from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of her having withdrawn into the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, before Mr. Villars arrived in town, ſhe thought Sir William muſt be as well convinced of this as herſelf: ſhe began to ſuſpect that Sir William, ſo far from being deceived, ſought only to deceive her—that, delivered up to his reſentment, on being perſuaded, that he ſhould never be able to touch her heart, he had reſolved to puniſh that as a crime in her, which he felt to be ſo ſevere a misfortune to himſelf. His ſaying, that he had ſeen that which ſhe was entirely clear in her own mind he never could have ſeen, confirmed this idea; and made her conclude that he only ſought to colour an act of extreme cruelty and revenge, with the thin veil of juſtice.</p>
                     <p>Theſe ideas filled her with deſpair. She had placed her hopes of redreſs upon the belief, that her juſtification would be as acceptable to Sir William as advantageous to herſelf. But now ſhe began to think, that her greateſt difficulty would not be in prevailing upon Mrs. Ulric to deliver her letter, but in inducing Sir William to give it a candid reading. His prohibition to write to him—his declaration that he wiſhed only for forgetfulneſs—his acknowledgment, that the voice of penitance would plead in vain—all concurred to make it evident, that he wiſhed not to have her innocence eſtabliſhed.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="121" facs="unknown:036127_0333_1008521D6EC82688"/>'It is hatred and revenge which have placed me here,' ſaid ſhe, the tears running down her cheeks: 'and it would be in vain to hope for my deliverance from tenderneſs and love.'</p>
                     <p>Her thoughts haſtily returned to the garden. Again ſhe reconſidered the walls of it. Their height, their ſolidity, precluded every hope of eſcape that way. Her own helpleſs ſtate, even could ſhe get out, now alſo ruſhed upon her mind. To owe her deliverance to her own pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, ſhe felt was impoſſible. And as ſhe would not neglect any poſſible chance of putting an end to her ſorrows, ſhe finally reſolved, not withſtanding her hopeleſſneſs of its ſucceſs, to try the effect of a letter to Sir William—Thus ſhe wrote.</p>
                     <p>'I addreſs you not as a penitent, not as an object of your love, I appeal only to your juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice. I am innocent. Never, even in thought, have I wandered from the duty that I owe you. Of this you will ſome time be convinced. If, therefore, you have any conſideration for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture peace of your mind, wait not for this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viction, until my injuries are paſt redreſs.</p>
                     <p>'I beſeech you, let me underſtand the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars of my accuſation, that I may be able to clear myſelf even from ſuſpicion. To the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent unintelligible charge which you bring againſt me, I can only repeat, that I am innocent. If you will condeſcend to explain yourſelf to me, I can prove myſelf ſo. I know of no viſit, I am conſcious of no invitation, which can fix the ſlighteſt ſtigma upon my name, of none which I would not avow in the face of the whole world. I cannot comprehend what you mean. I ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs,
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:036127_0334_1008521EF7366640"/>
however, all complaint. I am willing to believe you have acted upon a miſtake: and if you will only permit me to ſee and to converſe with you, I am confident I ſhall loſe at once all cauſe and all inclination to complain.'</p>
                     <p>Having finiſhed this letter, ſhe reſolved to aſſail Mrs. Ulric with all her powers, when next ſhe ſaw her. Nor was the opportunity long wanting. This compaſſionate woman, whoſe heart was ill ſuited to the taſk aſſigned her, was not able to abſent herſelf long from her unfortunate priſoner, leſt ſome conſolation might be wanting which ſhe could afford. She enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the room, bringing with her ſome biſcuits and a cup of chocolate; for Ellen, with all her efforts, had not been able to ſwallow a morſel at breakfaſt.</p>
                     <p>Ellen took the refreſhment which was offered her with a ſmile: put a part of one of the biſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuits in her mouth: and taſted the chocolate. But ſhe could do no more. Her heart ſwelled: and tears ran down her cheeks. Mrs. Ulric looked on her with compaſſion, and ſought to ſoothe her.</p>
                     <p>Ellen ſeized her hand; and preſſing it fervent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to her lips, 'Oh! if you could be induced to aſſiſt me!' ſaid ſhe. The tone of theſe words ſeemed to penetrate the heart of Mrs. Ulric. She too wept. The moment ſeemed favourable: and Ellen, holding out the letter to her, looked in her face with a countenance of entreaty that could not be miſunderſtood. It was perfectly intelligible to Mrs. Ulric: But ſhe put the letter back with her hand; and ſhook her head in token of refuſal.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="123" facs="unknown:036127_0335_100852238979EF10"/>'Let me prevail,' ſaid Ellen, joining her hands together.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Ulric withdrew a few ſteps.</p>
                     <p>'I have no hope if you deny me,' ſaid Ellen; and threw herſelf on her knees before her.</p>
                     <p>Greatly moved, Mrs. Ulric ſtooped haſtily to raiſe her.</p>
                     <p>Again Ellen offered her the letter: but Mrs. Ulric withdrew her hand, and walked toward the door.</p>
                     <p>'Have you no pity?' ſaid Ellen.</p>
                     <p>The moving tones of her voice ſeemed to ſubdue Mrs. Ulric. She returned—ſhe raiſed Ellen to the ſofa. She took the letter; but open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the drawer of the writing-table, ſhe depoſited the letter there, locked the drawer, and gave Ellen the key.</p>
                     <p>The calm deciſion of this action robbed Ellen of every hope. She ſat for ſome moments a motionleſs image of deſpair. The blood forſook her lips; and ſhe ſcarcely breathed. Mrs. Ulric approached her. She kneeled down before her. She took her hand; and reſpectfully kiſſed it: She ſeemed to ſay, 'Unhappy that I am not to be able to do as you wiſh me.'</p>
                     <p>Ellen was not inſenſible, even to this degree of kindneſs. 'Cruel Sir William!' exclaimed ſhe, 'had you but allowed me to have been un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, how eaſily ſhould I have worked upon this worthy woman to have befriended me! But you have indeed taken your meaſures ſecurely. You have indeed known how to make my ruin complete.'</p>
                     <p>Ellen wept bitterly as ſhe pronounced theſe words: and Mrs. Ulric ſeemed ſo affected, that El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len

reſolved to make one more effort to prevail on her to receive her letter. But, as ſhe was about to unlock the drawer, Mrs. Ulric per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived her intention, placed her hand upon it, and evidently ſhewed her that the attempt would be in vain and Ellen at length, perſuaded that Mrs. Ulric was inexorable only from what ſhe conſidered as a principle of duty, finally gave up the conteſt.</p>

                     <p>MRS. ULRIC had not the ſhadow of a doubt of Ellen's guilt. Sir William had made it clear to her, by a detail of circumſtances, which ſeemed to admit but of one explanation. His own diſtreſs, the tender conſideration, which, even in preparing the puniſhment, he had ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted for every poſſible conſolation to be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtered to Ellen, not incompatible with that puniſhment, had convinced Mrs. Ulric of the ſincerity of his love, and the bitterneſs of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gret, for the meaſures that he thought himſelf obliged to purſue. Theſe circumſtances, joined with the agonies ſhe had witneſſed in him, when the moment at laſt came of delivering Ellen into her hands, left her not a ſuſpicion, but certainty, that Ellen being no longer deſerving of his love, could be alone his motive for withdrawing it.</p>
                     <p>Theſe were two points in which Sir William knowingly deceived Mrs. Ulric. He had repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to her, that even in the puniſhment to which he had doomed Ellen, he had been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuated
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:036127_0338_1008522E03F156A0"/>
by motives of mercy; that a much ſeverer <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ate awaited her from the cuſtoms of her own country, and from the indignation of her parents; and that if he were to deliver her to them, not only impriſonment would be her lot, but an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſonment of a much more rigorous kind, aggra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated by darkneſs, faſting, and ſtripes.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Ulric therefore conſidered Sir William not only as one of the moſt injured and unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate of men, but as one of the moſt compaſſionate and worthy. This deceit had been ſuggeſted from a knowledge of Mrs. Ulric's character, who would never have conſented to become an inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſo much injuſtice as was attached to Sir William's conduct, even in the caſe of Ellen's actual guilt. But, acting under the error into which ſhe had been betrayed, although the mild and winning manners of Ellen, with the graces of her perſon, and the miſery of her ſituation, made the heart of Mrs. Ulric overflow with the ſofteſt compaſſion; yet did ſhe not look upon her as pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed more than her crimes deſerved, or feel in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to do aught toward reſtoring her to the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence of a huſband, whom ſhe believed ſhe had ſo grievouſly injured.</p>
                     <p>In another particular, alſo, Sir William had miſled Mrs. Ulric, and from ſomething of a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar motive, wiſhing by accumulated proofs of Ellen's guilt, to take away the poſſibility at any future moment of her being able to fix any blame upon him in the mind of a perſon on whoſe fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity he was, after all his precautions, obliged to depend for the final accompliſhment of his purpoſes.</p>
                     <p>He had therefore ſignified to Mrs. Ulric, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="127" facs="unknown:036127_0339_1008522F8BAF2E30"/>
offspring of that guilty love, which ſhe was now to expiate by perpetual impriſonment. It there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore happened, that Mrs. Ulric never looked upon Ellen, but ſhe thought ſhe ſaw an irrefragable proof of her crime. And every effort Ellen made to prove her innocence, Mrs. Ulric conſidered only as attempts either to move compaſſion, or as ſhews of penitence.</p>
                     <p>This Mrs. Ulric had, indeed, been the perſonal ſervant of the Bohemian lady, whom Sir William repreſented her to Ellen as having ſerved. But this lady was now dead; nor had ſhe inhabited the houſe where Ellen now was for many years before her death. It belonged to the nobleman her ſon, an intimate friend of Sir William, and, in the preſent circumſtances, his only confidant. To him ſir William had communicated firſt his ſuſpicions of Ellen's infidelity, and afterwards his certainty of it: and by him had been ſuggeſted the idea of the nature of the puniſhment to be inflicted. He had pointed out the eligibility of this decayed and ſolitary manſion for the purpoſes of a priſon: and he had repreſented, that, in the tried faith and gentle manners of Mrs. Ulric, he would find ſuch a jailoreſs as he deſired. All he had to do was to convince her of the juſtice and mercy of the plan propoſed, and he might rely upon her integrity without a fear. She was, when ſir William's friend recommended her to him, entirely dependant upon and ſupported by his bounty: and ſhe would willingly under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take any charge with which he would intruſt her that did not militate againſt her ideas of rectitude.</p>
                     <p>Sir William had reſolved, in conſequence of what he believed he had aſcertained, during his viſit in Devonſhire, to have removed Ellen ab<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ad
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:036127_0340_100852329AAD1230"/>
immediately after ſhe was ſufficiently recovered from her lying-in to bear ſuch a journey.</p>
                     <p>But Ellen's conduct in her requiſition to leave town, ſo ſeemingly the reſult of the pureſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity, had ſtaggered Sir William's firm belief in her guilt; and had determined him to make one experiment as to what her reſidence in the country would produce. He had been perfectly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, that the child was not his; and hence his evident diſlike to him when alive, and the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion he had ſuffered to eſcape him, on his death. But there had been ſuch an unjuſtifiable brutality in his expreſſion on that occaſion, and the effect it had on Ellen was ſo grievous, that there was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing he would not have done, to have effaced the impreſſion it had made.</p>
                     <p>The placability of Ellen's temper had ſoftened his heart. He began to believe, he had been miſled by an unfounded jealouſy. He began to hope, that mutual love might ſpring up between them: and he had nearly forgotten all his ſchemes of revenge and chaſtiſement, when the accidental diſcovery of Henry eſcaping over the hedge of the garden, drove from his mind all doubt of the guilt, and all moderation in the puniſhment of it.</p>
                     <p>From this moment, his whole thoughts were turned to concealing and perfecting the deſigns, which he was now reſolute to proſecute to the utmoſt: and to this purpoſe might be referred every thing that he had done, from the moment in which he announced to Ellen his intentions of quitting Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, to that in which he had followed her with his eyes for the laſt time.</p>
                     <p>Often, indeed, had the force of his emotions been too ſtrong for his hypocriſy. But Ellen hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no clue to guide her ſuſpicions aright, he had
<pb n="129" facs="unknown:036127_0341_100852360D31DE60"/>
eſcaped detection. She had conſidered what was indeed the breaking forth of his future deſign, but as the remains of a jealouſy with which ſhe was but too well acquainted, and for which ſhe ſometimes hoped a cure from time and the unde<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>viating prudence of her own conduct; and for which, at others, ſhe was ſadly perſuaded there was no cure poſſible.</p>
                     <p>Often had the fair and candid ſoul of Ellen, which appeared in her every action, made him miſtruſt what he thought was the evidence of his own ſenſes. But the conviction that he owed his preſent perſuaſion only to ſuch evidence diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pelled every doubt, and ſo fully ſettled his belief of the falſhood of Ellen, that he could as ſoon have called in queſtion his own exiſtence as her guilt.</p>
                     <p>Having communicated his final reſolves to his friend, many ſteps preparatory to the execution of his plan, had been taken before his arrival in Saxony: and Ellen's impriſonment was to have commenced with the winter. But when Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam unexpectedly found her with child, at a time when he could not doubt but that the child was his, his former deſire for an heir to his eſtate, which had ſo large a ſhare in his determination to marry, returned with freſh force to his mind. But to give a public legitimacy to the infant that Ellen would bring, it was neceſſary that ſhe ſhould be known to have been with child; nor muſt the date of her pretended death take place ſo early as to make it impoſſible that the child, who was ſometime to be produced, could be hers.</p>
                     <p>Theſe conſiderations prolonged to Ellen the term of her liberty. But though the circumſtances
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:036127_0342_10085237A836E818"/>
of her pregnancy might delay the time of her being ſhut up, it would in the end facilitate the plan. It was only by a feigned tale of her death, that he could hope to put a ſtop to the enquiries of her Engliſh friends: and there was no incident upon which he could found ſuch a tale with equal appearance of probability, as one ſo frequently attended by the moſt ſudden and fatal cataſtrophe. The dangerous ſtate to which Ellen had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in her firſt lying-in, would contribute to eſtabliſh the credit of the pretended event of the ſecond.</p>
                     <p>It was therefore ſettled between Sir William and his friend, that ſhe ſhould remain at Dreſden until within three months of the expected time of her lying-in; that Sir William ſhould then remove to the Saxon village, that he might be ſufficiently near the place of her intended confinement, to ſatisfy himſelf, that every preparation neceſſary for it was executed to his wiſhes. And it was agreed, that when ſhe was within a very ſhort period of the time of her being to be brought to bed, ſhe ſhould, under pretence of beginning her journey to Vienna, be conducted thither.</p>
                     <p>The tale that Sir William meant to tell, was, that, being ſeized unexpectedly with the pains of labour, at an obſcure inn on the road to Vienna, ſhe had there expired.</p>
                     <p>Sir William had ſome fears, that the agitation and grief which Ellen would unavoidably undergo, when ſhe found the heavy deſtiny that awaited her through the reſt of her life, might prove pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial to the ſafety of the child. But he had alſo almoſt equal hopes that the co<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> of this circumſtance might operate to imp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="231" facs="unknown:036127_0343_1008523BC40C50E0"/>
be able to aſſume. And theſe hopes, which were founded upon the excellence of Ellen's cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, were not vain.</p>
                     <p>It was Sir William's intention to linger near the ſpot of Ellen's confinement, until ſhe was brought to bed; and when he was informed of the conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences of that event, then to diſmiſs her from his ſolicitude for ever, and make all the advance he could in the road to forgetfulneſs.</p>
                     <p>That no circumſtance might hereafter obtrude Ellen upon his memory, he gave his friend on whoſe integrity he had a perfect reliance, power to draw upon him for any ſum neceſſary to defray the expenſes of her eſtabliſhment: and he ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed an agent at Dreſden, who was to be paid by the Bohemian nobleman, to furniſh every thing that Ellen might require. To authenticate her requiſitions, which he had ſignified to her were to be written in French, nothing more was neceſſary than the ſignature of Mrs. Ulric.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Ulric had, therefore, no immediate in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tercourſe with Sir William: and had ſhe been inclined to have favoured Ellen's cauſe, ſhe would not only have had Sir William's reſentment to have overcome, but the reluctance of her late maſter, who, ſhe knew, concurred in all that Sir William had done; and applauded the juſtice and mercy of his proceedings.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Ulric had been directed to inform Sir William, through the channel of this nobleman, how Ellen bore the firſt ſhock of her misfortune. And however favourable this report might be, it was very unlikely that the friend of Sir William ſhould take any ſtep towards reconciling him to a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> of whoſe guilt he was perfectly ſatisfied.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Ulric had made a faithful repreſentation of
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:036127_0344_1008523D4C993070"/>
Ellen's mildneſs, moderation, and patience. But imputing the whole to penitence, ſhe led both Sir William and his friend to believe, that Ellen had been ſufficiently explicit in the marks of this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trition, to furniſh, if that had been neceſſary, freſh proofs of her former guilt. Sir William, therefore, however miſerable, was far from re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting the ſtep he had taken. He had truly ſaid, "I am deaf to the voice of penitence." To for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give was not in his nature: and nothing but the conviction of Ellen's innocence would have in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to have reſtored her to liberty: and from this conviction he was farther removed than ever.</p>

                     <p>WHEN Ellen found all the hopes ſhe had en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained vain, of being able to move Mrs. Ulric in her favour, ſhe began to turn her thoughts upon ſome other individual, who might probably make a part of the houſehold.</p>
                     <p>She had hitherto ſeen only one other perſon; and ſhe ſoon found that the houſe contained no more. This was a hale, ſtout country girl, with an open good humoured countenance: and though the being totally without the means of applying to the intereſted feelings of ſuch a one was an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtacle to her ſucceſs, in circumſtances which ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted of any other hope, Ellen would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as invincible, hers was not a ſituation, where even great difficulties ought to diſcourage her: and ſhe reſolved to make the attempt. She hoped, by the courteouſneſs of her manners, to conciliate the girl's good will: and ſhe ſometimes flattered herſelf, that precaution had not been ſo unremittingly awake as to have extended to an ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norant girl, whom it was known ſhe could not bribe, the prohibition as to receiving any letter
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:036127_0346_100852458605FA18"/>
from her hands. She had no doubt that ſhe, like Mrs. Ulric, ſpoke only German; and had there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore no hope of moving her by argument.</p>
                     <p>By having attended cloſely to the words which Mrs. Ulric always uſed to herſelf when ſhe ſought to induce her to any compliance, ſhe thought her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf miſtreſs of one phraſe of entreaty in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage that would be underſtood: and armed with this piece of rhetoric, and a letter in her hand, ſhe one day accoſted the damſel. But what was her aſtoniſhment, when, with a broad ſtare of incomprehenſion, ſhe was anſwered in ſounds more uncouth and unintelligible than had ever before met her ears.</p>
                     <p>Ellen ſhrunk back: and hope died within her, when ſhe found this freſh impediment to the ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of her plans: for ſhe eaſily comprehended, that the girl was a true-born Bohemian, and ſpoke only her native Sclavonian.</p>
                     <p>The many plans which Ellen had laid to gain the attention of this girl, and the various ſchemes which ſhe had adopted and rejected as likely means, or as being impoſſible to engage her compaſſion, and explain her own wiſhes to her, had ſo fully occupied her mind for ſome days, that ſhe had had leſs leiſure to reflect upon her actual ſituation. In the hopes of liberty, ſhe loſt, for a time, a ſenſe of her reſtraint: and when, by the diſcovery of the impoſſibility of making the girl comprehend her, theſe hopes ſeemed to ſhrink to nothing, a new, and even a more lively intereſt prevented her from feeling the whole weight of her diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment.</p>
                     <p>She had received thoſe preparations for her approaching indiſpoſition which Sir William had promiſed her in his letter: and ſhe buſied herſelf
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:036127_0347_100852470D970100"/>
in arranging every thing relative to that period This ſubject being fully in her mind, ſhe naturally reverted to the ray of hope which Sir William himſelf ſeemed to allow the birth of a child af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded her. She endeavoured to diſcover the true meaning of the words he had uſed.</p>
                     <p>It was evident, that he was perſuaded the child was his own: and under this perſuaſion it was but too likely he would not ſuffer it to remain in her care. In the caſe of its being removed from her, what hope could ſpring from its exiſtence, to gild her future life?—When Sir William had once announced her death to her friends (and by a ſtory of her death, ſhe naturally concluded, he could alone conceal her impriſonment) he had put it out of his own power, without fixing an inde<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible reproach upon himſelf, to reſtore her to the world: and however probable ſhe might think it, that he would defer ſuch an annunciation, till after the expected period of her lying-in, which was well known to her Engliſh friends, as a ſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity againſt any doubts of the legitimacy of the child he might produce, yet ſhe felt it nearly impoſſible that he ſhould delay it longer. What good, then, could ſhe derive from becoming the mother of an infant, who, under theſe ſuppoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, would be ignorant of her very exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>If Sir William, therefore, really foreſaw any advantage poſſible to accrue to her from the birth of the child, it muſt be his having determined, under ſome circumſtances, to leave it to her care. But when ſhe recalled the earneſt wiſh he had formerly expreſſed for an heir, and the very evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent care he took to preſerve the exiſtence of the unborn infant, ſhe could not for a moment in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge a hope, that this would be the caſe if the
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:036127_0348_1008524C417F8B80"/>
child were a boy. The hope, therefore, which in ſo doubtful a manner he had endeavoured to inſpire her with, ſeemed to reſt upon one of theſe two ſuppoſitions: Either that he had ſuggeſted it merely as a means to quiet the firſt exceſſes of her grief, without any intention of its being followed by any real good to her; or, that if the child proved a girl, he did in truth propoſe to leave her in poſſeſſion of it. To this latter poſſibility ſhe clang with a fond partiality, as to the only ſource of happineſs which remained to her on this ſide the grave.</p>
                     <p>The more ſhe conſidered the matter, the more ſhe perſuaded herſelf it was probable: and the more it appeared probable, the more it became neceſſary to her. Soon her mind could admit of no other idea. The gloom of the priſon ſeemed to clear up, its ſolitude to diſappear. Wherever ſhe turned her eyes, this little girl was before her. She ſaw it in the helpleſs fatuity of the firſt weeks of its life. She marked the firſt ſmile of intelligence that ſparkled in its eyes. She beheld the firſt ſymptoms of deſign in its actions. She heard the firſt half-formed articulate ſound which eſcaped from its lips. In imagination ſhe began the taſk of inſtruction, and beheld her moſt ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duous efforts repaid a thouſand fold, by having gained a companion and a friend.</p>
                     <p>If ſuch an illuſory progreſſion of but too often unrealiſed bliſs fills the breaſt of every tender and reflecting female, when about to become a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and communicates a ſenſe of happineſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>felt and unimagined in every other circumſtance, even in the moſt proſperous life, with what tremb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling tranſport muſt <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

How muſt ſhe prize a poſſeſſion, which was to be her <hi>all</hi> of joy? And how muſt her heart grow cold as ſhe thought this bleſſing might be withheld from her—that this poſſeſſion might be ſnatched from her arms.</p>
                     <p>But that all this fabric of happineſs ſhould de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon the ſex of her child, when her heart was diſpoſed to love equally a boy or girl, pointed to her apprehenſion the peculiar wretchedneſs of her fate, the circumſtances of which could ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend the moſt natural affections of the ſoul, and render it doubtful whether a mother ſhould view the face of her offspring with pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>A ſhort period brought the matter to an iſſue: and Ellen was delivered of a daughter. Ellen claſped the infant to her heart; and forgot for a moment her captivity. The next ſhe feared to loſe what ſhe ſo highly prized. Thoſe reaſonings which had before appeared ſo concluſively to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure her the undiſturbed poſſeſſion of a daughter, now ſeemed weak and unſatisfactory. She doubted where ſhe had before been certain. She feared where ſhe had hoped.</p>
                     <p>In the mean time, ſhe recovered her health much faſter than could have been hoped: and, fully occupied in nurſing her little girl, the days paſſed eaſily. She began to believe, that Sir William had ceaſed to think either of her or his child: and truſting in the viciſſitudes which time always produces, ſhe ſoothed her mind with the diſtant hope, that a period would arrive when ſhe ſhould be reſtored to thoſe ſhe loved.</p>
                     <p>Could ſhe have found any means of informing her family and friends of her ſituation, ſhe would have been far from feeling her preſent lot as an
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:036127_0350_10085250D343CEF8"/>
unhappy one. It was the thought of what they would ſuffer on her ſuppoſed death, which at this time formed her bittereſt reflections. Removed from the perpetual ill humour and injurious ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picions of Sir William, miſtreſs of her time and her employments, holding in her arms, or nou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing at her breaſt the dear object of her ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dereſt affections, ſhe experienced a degree of calm ſatisfaction which had long been a ſtranger to her mind—that mind unclouded by ſelf-reproach, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſtracted by ſelfiſh ſolicitudes, repoſed itſelf in peace on the protection of a Providence, whoſe wiſdom it could not doubt, and of whoſe good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs it was aſſured.</p>
                     <p>Three months were now fully paſt ſince the birth of Ellen's daughter: and to the partial ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſions of the mother ſhe was already become a very intereſting companion. Ellen believed, or thought ſhe believed, that there were none of her actions which the child did not underſtand: and ſhe was more than repaid the compliment by un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly underſtanding all that the child did.</p>
                     <p>Ellen now wanted no other companion. To Mary ſhe talked; and to Mary ſhe ſung. She held her in her arms all day: and when ſhe had placed her in her crib for the night, ſhe drew her chair cloſe to it, and, with her eyes fixed more upon the face of the child, than upon the book ſhe held in her hand and imagined that ſhe read. The fear that her treaſure ſhould be ſnatched from her now ſeldom obtruded itſelf. Every paſſing day took away from the probability of its being realized. If it occurred, ſhe was tempted to conſider it as an ungrateful doubting of the benevolence of Providence: and ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, as faulty, all thoughts that led to it.</p>

                     <p>IN this ſtate of contentment and ſecurity was Ellen, when, one morning, as ſhe was engaged in ſuckling her child, Mrs. Ulric entered. Ellen raiſed her eyes towards her, and was immediately ſtruck with the ſadneſs of her countenance. Ellen, who in holding her child in her arms, felt that all the treaſure ſhe had on earth was ſecure, thought not of herſelf. She held out her hand to Mrs. Ulric; and longed for words to inquire into the cauſe of her grief, and to offer her conſolation. But, alas! ſhe was herſelf the true object of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſion. Mrs. Ulric ſat down by her ſide. She ſighed; and, taking the infant from her, delivered her a letter.</p>
                     <p>Ellen caſt her eyes on the ſuperſcription. She knew Sir William's hand: and ſhe anticipated, in a moment, all he had to ſay to her. The blood forſook her lips. She became ſick: and her whole frame trembled ſo extremely, that it was with difficulty ſhe opened the letter. Theſe were its contents:</p>
                     <p>'I am willing to perſuade myſelf that my preſent deſign will meet with a ready acquieſcence from you. The perſon who delivers this letter, has orders to take charge of my daughter. She
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:036127_0352_10085256767E60E0"/>
will be conveyed to me with every ſolicitous at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to her ſafety and convenience, which you could yourſelf dictate. I believe, that as your good ſenſe will withhold you from any oppoſition to this plan, which, you muſt be convinced, will ultimately prove fruitleſs; ſo I am perſuaded your humanity is ſuch, as to take from you all ſelfiſh deſire to make this innocent victim of your miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conduct, a partaker of your puniſhment. When ſeparated from you, ſhe will be in the full enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of every bleſſing a father's affection can beſtow: and you ſurely cannot but wiſh that her cheek may for ever remain untinged by a ſenſe of your ſhame, and her heart unwounded by a know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of your afflictions. If your heart ſadden with the thought, that you will never behold her more, be conſoled by the aſſurance, that from this period I ſhall promote her happineſs even at the expenſe of my own. For a meaſure ſo conſonant to the beſt intereſts of your offspring, no apology appears neceſſary: and for the manner in which I ſee proper to diſpoſe of my own, I do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive I owe you any. With every wiſh, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, for the perfect reſtoration of peace to your boſom, I now bid you finally and for ever fare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wel.'</p>
                     <p>'Never, never<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>' ſaid Ellen, wildly ſnatching the infant from Mrs. Ulric, 'will I part with my child. Go, go and tell his agent ſo. Toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they may force us from this place: but never ſhall they ſeparate us.'</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Ulric was prepared for the tears and the grief of Ellen. But the wildneſs of her air, and the determined tone of her voice ſurpriſed and diſconcerted her.</p>
                     <p>'Ah! madam,' ſaid ſhe, 'would you have
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:036127_0353_1008525955F08808"/>
this poor innocent remain a perpetual priſoner with you?'</p>
                     <p>As ſhe ſpoke, ſhe fixed her eyes upon the child, with a look of the tendereſt compaſſion. The ſound of her voice, and her action ſmote upon Ellen's heart. She burſt into tears.</p>
                     <p>'No,' rejoined Mrs. Ulric, 'you are too good:' and ſhe attempted to take the child from her. But Ellen claſping it to her breaſt, ruſhed into the next room, and faſtened the door. Here in a tumult of paſſion, which, for ſome time, ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended every power of reaſon, Ellen wept over her infant in all the bitterneſs of diſtraction and deſpair. But in the abodes where virtue is ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to preſide, the uſurpation of paſſion can be of no long duration. Ellen was not ſo loſt in ſelf as to forget her child: and no ſooner did her heart acknowledge the cruelty there might be in a wiſh to detain her with her, than her part was taken. But it was with a pang, far exceeding his, who, in his haſte to eſcape from immediate danger, deſtroys with his own hand that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, on which alone all his future hopes of hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs depend, that Ellen reſolved to part with her daughter. Never had ſhe felt a miſery ſo in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſupportable, and which ſeemed ſo entirely to drive reaſon from her ſeat, as was inflicted by the thought, that ſhe beheld, for the laſt time, this object ſo beloved. To be reſtored to ſociety and reputation, now became a hundred fold more important to her than ever: and the deſpair of ever being able to accompliſh a purpoſe, now ſo momentous, drove her to the point of diſtraction<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Suddenly a gleam of hope burſt through this gloom.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="142" facs="unknown:036127_0354_1008525C50DDD348"/>'My infant ſhall be the bearer of a letter to her father,' ſaid Ellen. 'If I can but once in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce him to hear me, I muſt be juſtified.' At this thought, the turbulence of her paſſions ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided. She became calm. 'Who can tell,' cried ſhe, freſh hope kindling in her heart, 'but theſe are the very means a merciful God, who never forgets his creatures' ſufferings, has ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for my deliverance.'</p>
                     <p>Ellen ſoon afterwards appeared before Mrs. Ulric, who eaſily comprehended by the ſettled, calm, and deep ſorrow, which had taken place of a violence ſo unuſual, that Ellen was diſpoſed to ſubmit to the commands of Sir William. Ellen, however, by never quitting her child for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and by evidently keeping over it a jealous and ſuſpicious watch, ſhewed that ſhe meant not to part with it immediately. Mrs. Ulric was willing to wait at leaſt till the next day, before ſhe took any forcible means to deprive her of it: and ſo far their intentions agreed, that Ellen had no deſign of retaining it longer with her than till the next morning. This night, this laſt night that ſhe might ever embrace it, when the hour of its repoſe came, ſhe placed it, not as uſual into its crib, but holding it on her knees, there lulled it to ſleep. In this poſture, with her heart filled with deſpair, and her eyes overflowing with the bittereſt tears that ever woman ſhed, ſhe wrote the following letter to Sir William.</p>
                     <p>'To the voice of reaſon and of humanity may my heart never be deaf! though in obeying their dictates that heart ſhould cleave in twain.</p>
                     <p>'I deliver my daughter to you, becauſe ſhe is yours alſo; and becauſe I wiſh not for any al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leviation to my ſorrows, which muſt ariſe from
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:036127_0355_1008525ECF117F88"/>
my aſſociating her in my misfortune: But what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be her deſtiny, as to happineſs; or mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, ſhe <hi>cannot</hi> be the victim of my crimes; for <hi>I am guiltleſs.</hi> The angels of heaven are not more free of the crime of which you accuſe me than I am.</p>
                     <p>'You have ſaid, you liſten not to the voice of penitence. It is not the voice of penitence, it is the cry of innocence that aſſails you, an innocence as ſpotleſs, in all that relates to you, as that of the babe who now looks upon you, and bids you do juſtice to her injured mother.</p>
                     <p>'I am unable to underſtand the circumſtances upon which you have condemned me. I can therefore make no defence except you will explain yourſelf farther. Be juſt alike to yourſelf and me—ſee me—hear me—I aſk not this as a favour from your pity, or your love. I demand it as a right. I demand it in compaſſion to you, as well as myſelf. My ruin involves your condemnation. I would preſerve you from too late a repentance. Refuſe not to liſten to this ſolicitation. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering the precautions you have taken, it is the laſt that can ever reach you. It is the ſolicitation —I muſt ſpeak out, for who have I to ſpeak for me! of ſuffering virtue, of oppreſſed innocence, of wounded juſtice. Oh! Sir William, when I offer ſo cruel a ſacrifice to the rights you aſſert over me, deny me not that, which the moſt abject criminal may exact.'</p>
                     <p>Ellen continued to hold her infant on her knees, and to gaze on its face through the whole of this diſtreſsful night, without the power of cloſing her eyes, or loſing in forgetfulneſs the ſenſe of her wretchedneſs for one ſingle moment. When the morning dawned, the infant awoke. Ellen put it
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:036127_0356_10085261D93F93C8"/>
to her breaſt. 'Deareſt of human creatures,' ſaid ſhe, preſſing it cloſely to her, 'and do I give thee ſuſtenance for the laſt time? Oh! my God, enable me to ſupport a deprivation ſo cruel!'</p>
                     <p>Ellen then proceeded to dreſs her child; and ſewing up the letter ſhe deſigned for Sir William in a piece of cloth, ſhe faſtened it under the upper veſt of the infant. To have endeavoured to convey it by any other means, ſhe was aſſured would have been fruitleſs: but ſhe perſuaded her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that nothing could be more certain, than that whoever found a paper directed to Sir Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam in the clothes of his child, would carefully deliver it to him: and ſhe thought it very impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, that the perſon appointed to convey the child, and who would not have ſeen her, ſhould have received any prohibition as to forwarding any letter from her: and even if ſuch a prohibition had been given, it would hardly appear a diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard of it, to deliver a paper found upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of the child, the writer of which could at moſt only be gueſſed at. Theſe conſiderations tranquilized her as to the delivery of the letter: but the reception it would meet with, and the effect it would produce, were matters of much more doubtful event.</p>
                     <p>Conſcious of her own innocence, Ellen's firſt thoughts had led her to believe that it was only neceſſary to be heard, to make this innocence evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent: and from the ſame purity of mind, ſhe had felt a perfect confidence, that Sir William's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct originated rather from miſtaken ideas of the puniſhment due to the crime he ſuppoſed her to have been guilty of, than from any juſtifiable re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment for that want of love on her part, of which he was accuſtomed to complain, but which,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:036127_0357_10085264C1E8FF98"/>
he muſt be convinced, aroſe wholly from his own unkindneſs towards her.</p>
                     <p>More reflection had introduced ideas into her mind much leſs favourable to Sir William. She could not imagine any circumſtances from which ſuch a miſtake, as that on which ſhe had ſuppoſed Sir William to act, could have ariſen. The ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal which he made to the evidence of his own ſenſes, ſtrengthened the ſuſpicion of unfair deal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on his part: and it had received additional force by the unneceſſary cruelty which appeared in his ſo carefully ſhutting from her all means of making any application to him, and in the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feeling harſhneſs diſcoverable in more parts than one of his laſt letter.</p>
                     <p>Added to theſe conſiderations, were others that ſeemed ſcarcely leſs to militate againſt the hopes of her deliverance. She knew well the ſtructure of Sir William's mind. She knew how little ſhe had to hope from his generoſity or can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour. She knew the pertinacity with which he adhered to all his opinions, the reluctance which he felt to acknowledge himſelf miſtaken in the mereſt trifles: and ſhe could hardly flatter her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that if he <hi>were</hi> convinced, that he had fallen into an error, he would act from ſuch a convic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when, by ſo doing, he muſt ſo painfully eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſh her ſuperiority, and place himſelf for the reſt of their lives, in the light of the offending party. As ſhe was aware how impoſſible it would be to perſuade him, that ſhe really and in fact was capable of forgiving, and baniſhing from her mind a ſenſe of the injuries he had done her, and as ſhe knew he would feel aſſured that he muſt ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver hope to poſſeſs her love, ſhe but too reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ably concluded, that if even any love for her re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained,
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:036127_0358_10085266680FC0A8"/>
it would not be ſufficiently powerful to induce him to reſtore her to ſociety under cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſo diſgracefully humiliating, and ſo little happy to himſelf.</p>
                     <p>Theſe reflections would probably have had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence enough to have prevented any attempt on her part towards moving Sir William in her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour, and might have put her upon turning her thoughts to ſome more certain, though more diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant, means of deliverance, if the inſupportable agony which ſhe felt, on the threatened loſs of her child, had not made her conſider all delay in the hopes of rejoining it, a lengthened torture of ſo acute a kind, that ſhe doubted her own abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity to endure it with tolerable patience.</p>
                     <p>This feeling, and the reflexion, that if ſhe now o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted any one poſſible means of declaring her inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, it might hereafter be urged as a remiſſneſs ariſing from conſcious guilt, had determined her to try the fate of a letter to Sir William. But although, in her preſent circumſtances, this was <hi>all</hi> ſhe could do, ſo little did it appear likely to anſwer the purpoſe, that it was wholly ineffica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious in abating that miſery which the idea of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration from her child had impreſſed upon her mind: and when the letter was written and depo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſited under the infant's clothes, a melancholy ſenſe of its probable inutility filled her breaſt; and gave to the approaching deprivation all the horrors due to a farewel, which, as to this world, was to be final.</p>
                     <p>Ellen, notwithſtanding the oppreſſion of her feelings, wiſhed to conquer herſelf ſo far as to do that which ſhe had reſolved upon, with dignity and compoſure.</p>
                     <p>The opening and ſhutting of the doors in the
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:036127_0359_1008526A572DBF10"/>
gallery now told her ſhe might expect the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of Mrs. Ulric every moment. Her eyes were alternately fixed on the face of her child, and now turned with a look of apprehenſion to the door. She preſſed her lips to thoſe of the poor baby, with a fervency which, at any other time, ſhe would not have dared to have indulged, from the fear of hurting it. Every kiſs imprinted ſhe thought was to be the laſt: and as ſhe intently gazed upon its features, ſhe kiſſed each ſeparately, with a ſenſation of deſpair which ought only to belong to the guilty. Happy was it for the intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects of Ellen, that this ſcene was not much far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther prolonged.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Ulric came towards her: and Ellen riſing haſtily, with an effort that required all her forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude, put the child into her arms, and ruſhed from her into the next room. Mrs. Ulric, ſtruck with her courage, and moved by the tendereſt compaſſion, committed the infant to the care of thoſe who already waited to receive it; and then haſtened back, with all the diſpatch in her power, to adminiſter to Ellen all the conſolation which her humanity could afford. But Ellen remained long inſenſible to her kindneſs and her cares. Mrs. Ulric found her, on her return, in the higheſt ſtate of hyſteric affection. The diſorder baffled all the remedies which Mrs. Ulric's ſkill in medicine could ſuggeſt; and continued ſo long unſubdued as to raiſe in her mind very ſerious apprehenſions.</p>
                     <p>At length, nature ſeemed quite exhauſted: and Ellen fell into a heavy ſleep, which continued for ſome hours. When ſhe awoke, ſhe was leſs agitated, but ſo extremely reduced in ſtrength,
<pb n="148" facs="unknown:036127_0360_1008526C1ED226E8"/>
as to be unable to quit her bed, or ſcarcely to raiſe her head from her pillow.</p>
                     <p>She continued for ſome time ſubject to returns of the hyſterical diſorder: and when ſhe appeared to be recovered from theſe attacks, ſhe was ſeized with a depreſſion of ſpirits, which incapacitated her from all exertion; and ſeemed to deprive her even of the power of thinking.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Ulric conceived nothing more likely to remove this kind of indiſpoſition than the open air, and a variety of objects. The latter it was not in her power, to any extent, to afford her unhappy patient. But ſhe accompanied her for whole days in the garden, where ſhe often in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced her to continue by ſpreading a repaſt under the ſhade of the trees, or by bringing her the harp, and intimating a deſire to hear her play upon it. Ellen was not loſt to the pleaſure of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liging: and in the preſent ſtate of her mind, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no deſires of her own, ſhe ſeemed wholly di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected by thoſe of her companion. Mrs. Ulric, ſomewhat to vary the ſcene, ventured to unlock the garden door, and to walk ſome little way into the adjacent country. The door opened upon a wild heath, which was ſkirted by a thick wood, and in this wood they frequently walked. Inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly this wiſe and gentle treatment produced the deſired effect; Ellen began to awake, as it were, from the lethargy into which ſhe had fallen. Her powers of reaſoning returned: and if ſhe felt more, ſhe acknowledged, that a ſtate of ſo alarm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an inſenſibility was well exchanged for one of ſuffering. The firſt reflection ſhe made was on the length of time which had elapſed ſince the departure of her child, and when ſhe found that
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:036127_0361_1008527106866CE8"/>
ſix weeks were gone, never more to return, ſhe gave up all hopes of receiving her deliverance from the juſtice or generoſity of Sir William.</p>
                     <p>How he might have been affected, if the letter had reached his hands, it is not poſſible to ſay: but the trial was never made: and Ellen owed the loſs of this feeble chance in her favour, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to deſign or treachery, but merely to acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent.</p>
                     <p>The circumſtance of any paper being concealed in the piece of cloth which Ellen had faſtened round the body of the child, had eſcaped the no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of its attendant. She had taken it merely for a part of its garments, and with the reſt of them having been ſent to the waſher-woman, Ellen's letter, in fragments and defaced, floated ſoon upon the water.</p>
                     <p>As Ellen had never attached much hope to this attempt to move Sir William in her favour, ſhe viewed the total diſappointment of it without any of thoſe acute feelings which might probably have precipitated her again into the melancholy ſtate of mind from which ſhe had only began to emerge: and it might indeed be owing to her feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings being blunted, as it were, by what ſhe had undergone, that ſhe bore ſo calmly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>

                     <p>EVERY day Ellen began to recover her faculties: and ſhe uſed every means in her power to rouſe herſelf to exertion, and to train her mind to fortitude. Patience and reſignation, thought ſhe, are all the virtues which I am permitted to practiſe. In the firſt moments of my over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>whelming affliction, I was ſaved, by inſenſibility, from the neceſſity of an exertion, which it might have been impoſſible to have made; for what I then failed in, I am not reſponſible. I am now called to make uſe of the reaſon which is reſtored to me; and let me attend to the call: That life is a blank, which is unmarked with the efforts of virtue: but it is a blank, which I ſhall be called to account for in another.</p>
                     <p>In conſequence of theſe reflections Ellen began, for the firſt time, to turn her attention to her books. She found the collection well choſen, and evidently with attention to her peculiar taſte. This circumſtance ſoftened her heart toward Sir William. Some few which ſhe wiſhed to have
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:036127_0363_10085276DCEDCEB8"/>
were wanting. She wrote down the names, and delivering the liſt to Mrs. Ulric, ſaw her ſign the paper. She readily underſtood, that this was the proof agreed upon, by which its authenticity was to be aſcertained. She obſerved, however, that Mrs. Ulric carefully inſpected the articles: and Ellen ſuppoſed ſhe was inſtructed, notwithſtanding her ignorance of the French language, how to diſtinguiſh between what was allowed and what was forbidden. Books, however, had been ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſsly named by Sir William, as what would be conſidered a lawful requiſition: and Ellen was therefore not ſurpriſed to find herſelf ſpeedily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with what ſhe wanted. As this, however, was the firſt experiment of the kind ſhe had made, ſhe felt a ſenſible pleaſure in its ſucceſs. There was ſomething in it, which connected her again with the world, from which, before, ſhe ſeemed ſo totally excluded: and when ſhe found, with certainty, that, by the ſtroke of her pen, ſhe could procure any gratification, or neceſſary that ſhe wanted, ſhe no longer felt herſelf abandoned to the degree ſhe had conceived before.</p>
                     <p>The evenings now grew long, and the days cold. She lived more in the houſe; and conſequently wanted a greater variety of employments there. She had no call for works either of ornament or uſe. With reſpect to her clothes, ſhe was ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with a greater profuſion than ſhe had any neceſſity for. They were all, it is true, of the plaineſt kind, and ſuch as (though they were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectly conformable to her) could not be converted into bribes to thoſe about her. To work without any end, would defeat her purpoſe; for how could ſhe be intereſted in the progreſs of an em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, which, in the end, muſt be uſeleſs?
<pb n="152" facs="unknown:036127_0364_10085279E7CCE760"/>
and ſhe found books and muſic were not ſufficient to carry her through wet and gloomy days, ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded by long and tempeſtuous evenings, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the aid of converſation or exerciſe.</p>
                     <p>In this deſtitution of employment, her mind preyed too much upon itſelf: and when her imagination repreſented to her the diſtreſs of her family and friends for her loſs—or when ſhe thought of her own captivity, cut off in her early youth from every ſocial affection, and from every active duty—but, above all, when ſhe reflected upon her ſeparation from her child, ſhe found the taſk of reſignation almoſt beyond her power.</p>
                     <p>Anxiouſly ſhe caſt her eyes around for ſome means of filling her time and employing her thoughts. Happily it occurred to her, that part of her Northumberland education had been the art of ſpinning. No ſooner did ſhe recollect this, than ſhe ſet about procuring a wheel, and every neceſſary to her employment. She knew the perfection to which the Bohemian linens were brought: and therefore concluded, ſhe ſhould find all the aſſiſtance to her manufacture which ſhe could deſire. She found her orders for a wheel as ſpeedily complied with as had been the one ſhe gave for books: and ſhe began her new occupation without delay.</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Ulric ſeemed highly pleaſed when ſhe ſaw her thus employed; and buſied herſelf in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving any trifling difficulties which aroſe. This new intereſt produced a freſh tie between them. Mrs. Ulric frequently brought her work, and paſſed the whole evening with Ellen. It is true, they could not converſe: but they had by this time eſtabliſhed a kind of language between them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, which ſerved extremely well for all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:036127_0365_1008527CE7EA1808"/>
purpoſes: and Ellen had even attained the knowledge of the meaning and the pronunciation of ſeveral German words.</p>
                     <p>This knowledge, however, ſhe acquired againſt the inclination of Mrs. Ulric: for Ellen eaſily perceived, that ſhe ſeemed to be ſorry when any word had eſcaped her: and the pertinacity with which ſhe always declined repeating any word which Ellen endeavoured to pronounce after her, and her apparent wilful miſconception, whenever Ellen took any means of inducing her to teach her in German the names of thoſe objects with which they were ſurrounded, made it clear to Ellen, that ſhe lay under the ſtricteſt poſſible prohibition as to teaching her the language: and ſhe ſaw, that ſhe adhered to her orders, with an integrity which all her attachment to Ellen, and the pleaſure which it muſt be ſuppoſed ſhe would naturally have taken in converſing with her, could not ſhake.</p>
                     <p>Ellen revered Mrs. Ulric the more for this ſteady adherence to what, ſhe had no doubt, was with her a point of duty: and ſhe eaſily forgave the effect, in conſideration of the cauſe, though the dreary melancholy of her life was ſo beyond meaſure increaſed by this very circumſtance. Had it not been for thoſe ſcruples in Mrs. Ulric, nothing could have been more eaſy than for Ellen to have learnt German: and as ſhe never loſt ſight of the hope of acquiring the language, as one moſt eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſential means to bring about her deliverance: ſhe treaſured up in her memory all that ſhe had learnt from Mrs. Ulric: and in ſpite of her precaution, ſhe added almoſt daily ſomething to her ſtore.</p>
                     <p>The winter paſſed away: the ſpinning plan
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:036127_0366_1008527FE4F169A8"/>
had ſucceeded fully: and Ellen now began to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt herſelf about the cloth which was to be ſent to the weaver, and that which was to be returned from him. She could not ſometimes help ſmiling at the artificial buſineſs ſhe had contrived for her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and at the perfect earneſtneſs in which ſhe ſaw Mrs. Ulric about the matter. But ſhe care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully avoided deſtroying the illuſion, and went on ſpinning as if her web were to be as long as Pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lope's might have been, but for "the back<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward labours of her hand."</p>
                     <p>Ellen's health was now thoroughly re-eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed: and ſhe endeavoured to add a degree of cheerfulneſs to the patience and reſignation which ſhe had hitherto practiſed. By frequently re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peating to herſelf all the German ſhe could ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire from her companion, her thoughts were more than ever fixed upon the language: and with ſo few circumſtances to divert them from any object, which even from a flight motive might have engaged them, it is not wonderful, if they were almoſt inceſſantly bent upon one, from which ſo important an advantage might be gained— to attain the German language became now the firſt wiſh of Ellen's mind; and ſhe was reſolved to take ſome vigorous ſtep towards it.</p>
                     <p>She had hitherto forborne to ſend for the books neceſſary to her inſtruction, as far as it was poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible ſhe could inſtruct herſelf, from an apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion that this was a requeſt upon which Mrs. Ulric would infallibly put a negative: But obſerving that Mrs. Ulric now ſeldom caſt her eye over the articles contained in the liſts ſhe ſigned, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to hazard the attempt.</p>
                     <p>Amongſt ſeveral other things which ſhe ſent for, only with the deſign of making the liſt larger,
<pb n="155" facs="unknown:036127_0367_10085282C8FAE3A0"/>
that ſo any particular article might more probably paſs unnoticed, ſhe put down all the German books which ſhe thought neceſſary to her purpoſe. She delivered this liſt to Mrs. Ulric the next time ſhe viſited her apartment. It was with no ſmall degree of ſolicitude that ſhe attended its fate: But ſhe had the ſatisfaction to ſee it ſigned without heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation or inſpection, and inſtantly ſealed and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected, by which diſpatch ſhe concluded that there was ſome immediate means of ſending it to Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den; and ſhe was confirmed in this conjecture by the ſpeed with which ſhe received the pacquet in return. And now, for the firſt time, ſhe had a ſecret from Mrs. Ulric. She carefully locked up her German treaſure, and took care to ſecure the door of her room whenever ſhe recurred to the ſtudy of that language. It was with the greateſt aſſiduity that ſhe purſued her taſk, but without ſome oral aſſiſtance, ſhe ſoon ſaw cauſe to fear that ſhe ſhould make no progreſs that could be uſeful to the great purpoſe, for which alone, at this time, ſhe had thought of acquiring the knowledge of the German tongue. She found, however, an incidental advantage in her new ſtudy: this was employment; and German for a time ſuperſeded ſpinning.</p>
                     <p>In theſe ſeveral occupations, diverſified with muſic and cheſs, in which ſhe had diſcovered Mrs. Ulric to be ſomewhat of a proficient, with a regular courſe of reading, and in the regulation of her own mind, ſupported with a vague hope that at ſome diſtant period her deliverance might make a part of the deſigns of Providence, Ellen paſſed her time: and ſuch was the tranquility which the innocence of her heart and the equa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nimity of her temper ſecured to her, under the
<pb n="156" facs="unknown:036127_0368_100852857367A718"/>
deprivation of nearly all that is ſuppoſed to make life deſirable, that not only ſhe enjoyed a degree of happineſs unknown to the moſt proſperous guilt, but ſuch as is unattainable even in the over eager purſuit of the moſt legitimate objects: Her mind was calm and vigorous, her body healthy and ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive; the roſes, which even the chagrins of the firſt months of her marriage had baniſhed, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to her cheeks; her eyes recovered their vivacity; her well formed limbs acquired all their natural agility, and perhaps Ellen had never, in the whole courſe of her life, appeared an object ſo proper to excite love and admiration, as ſhe did at this preſent period—and muſt it be, that ſuch a roſe is doomed for ever <q>'To waſte its ſweetneſs on the deſart air.'</q>

                     <p>TWO years were now paſſed, and a third far advanced, ſince Ellen entered the walls of this dreary habitation. No change ſeemed to await her: and amidſt the never ceaſing viciſſitudes of human affairs, her fate alone ſeemed fixed; as if the grave, indeed, had incloſed her. But he who could break the bonds of death, was not impotent to open the doors of her priſon.</p>
                     <p>About this period Mrs. Ulric fell ill; and her illneſs proved a rheumatic fever. Ellen attended her with all the aſſiduity that affection and grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude could inſpire; ſhe furniſhed her chamber with every poſſible accommodation, from her own: She frequently paſſed the night by her bed ſide, and thought nothing painful to herſelf that could contribute to alleviate the pains of Mrs. Ulric.</p>
                     <p>It was in her frequent viſits to the chamber of the invalid, that Ellen firſt obſerved that the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſervant had been changed; and that her ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor was a German. To this perſon, as Mrs. Ulric herſelf was entirely incapable of attending upon Ellen, devolved all the duties of waiting upon her meals, or adminiſtring to her any little
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:036127_0370_1008528C8141DA88"/>
ſervices ſhe might want. Ellen obſerved that ſhe performed all this with ſomething more than a common zeal to oblige: that ſhe appeared pleaſed to be employed: and often lingered in her apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments without any apparent reaſon. Ellen im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted all this to the natural good humour of the girl; who might probably be moved by the ſtate of captivity which ſhe could not but know ſhe was in. It occurred to her that ſhe might turn this compaſſion to ſomewhat better advantage than merely having her dinner warmer, or more nicely ſerved, by learning from her new attendant the better pronunciation of ſome German words. She made the experiment, and found it fully anſwered by the alacrity with which the girl ſeemed willing to enter into converſation. She obſerved that ſhe ſpoke, what appeared to her to be purer German than that ſpoken by Mrs. Ulric; and from hence ſhe concluded her to be a Saxon. This idea led her to imagine it highly probable that ſhe could read; and if it ſhould prove ſo, behold her at length furniſhed with a preceptreſs in the German tongue.</p>
                     <p>She made the trial on the inſtant, and was ſoon convinced that her conjecture was well founded. The girl read with fluency and pleaſure; ſeeming deſirous to recommend herſelf to Ellen to the beſt of her power. The book ſhe h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>d put into her hands was a book of ſuch familiar phraſes as are calculated for the uſe of learners; and when El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len was ſatisfied with the experiment ſhe had made, ſhe ſought a ſentence expreſſive of her thanks; and ſhe read it with as good pronunci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation as ſhe was miſtreſs of. The girl ſeemed forcibly ſtruck; and turning over the leaves, ſtopt not until ſhe found an expreſſion, the ſenſe of
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:036127_0371_1008528E0AA16B98"/>
which was, 'I owe all to you.' This ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced with ſo peculiar an emphaſis, pointing at the French on the other ſide, to Ellen, and looking upon her with ſo much meaning, and with a countenance ſo ſuited to the ſenſe of the words ſhe uſed, that Ellen felt an inſtant conviction that ſhe was known.</p>
                     <p>When words are wanting, the moſt untutored will have recourſe to actions. The girl, as if im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patient to explain herſelf, threw herſelf on her knees before Ellen, and paſſionately kiſſing her hand, pronounced the name of the Saxon village in which Ellen had paſſed ſo many weeks. This word inſtantly called to her recollection the fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of the perſon before her; and ſhe recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſed the daughter of the cottager, to whom her bounty had furniſhed ſo ſeaſonable a relief, when her habitation had been deſtroyed by fire.</p>
                     <p>Ellen's boſom had long been a ſtranger to the degree of delight which this diſcovery communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated: her quick conception anticipated, in a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, all the advantages ſhe might derive from it: and her firſt ſentiment being that of gratitude to an ever-watchful Providence, ſhe threw her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf on her knees by the girl, and, with uplifted hands and eyes, thanked Heaven for what ſhe felt as an earneſt of her deliverance.</p>
                     <p>From this moment ſcarcely an hour paſſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Ellen making ſome advance in her powers of communicating her ſentiments to her new friend; and as ſhe had from the firſt warned her to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal their intercourſe from Mrs. Ulric, their hours of lecture were conducted with the greateſt ſecrecy. Ellen thought it unneceſſary to explain any circumſtances of her ſituation farther to the girl, than to inform her that ſhe was an Engliſh
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:036127_0372_100852917032F570"/>
woman, and to aſſure her moſt ſolemnly that ſhe was unjuſtly detained from her country and friends; and that all ſhe deſired was the means of releaſing herſelf from her preſent confinement. She, however, fully expoſed her poverty, and her utter inability to reward any riſk the young wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man might run in aſſiſting her to eſcape. To all ſuch precautionary information, the girl conſtantly replied, in the grateful and affecting words that ſhe had firſt uſed, 'I owe all to you.'</p>
                     <p>It was only by degrees that they came to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand each other with tolerable eaſe: but Ellen learnt, through all the imperfection attending the very firſt of their communication, that her grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Saxon was ready to ſacrifice every thing for her ſake. When ſhe was able more fully to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand her, ſhe learnt that ſhe had only been taken by Mrs. Ulric on a diſappointment ſhe had of a ſervant whom ſhe had more approved: that as her ſubſiſtence depended upon her labour, ſhe did not doubt, as her character was good, of be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to find, without difficulty, as eligible an eſtabliſhment as her preſent one, ſhould ſhe loſe it in conſequence of her ſervices to Ellen.</p>
                     <p>Ellen, from her natural abhorrence to all diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſe, heſitated whether ſhe ſhould not, now ſhe could explain herſelf with tolerable facility, take Mrs. Ulric into her confidence; but, upon far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther reflection, ſhe found, that her preſent hopes were too dear to be put to hazard by a commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication, which, from the proofs ſhe had ſeen of Mrs. Ulric's high ſenſe of the ſacredneſs of the truſt repoſed in her, might be the means of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroying them all together. She conſidered that in effecting her eſcape, ſhe did juſtice to herſelf, without injuring any body: and ſhe felt aſſured,
<pb n="161" facs="unknown:036127_0373_100852948C8CB520"/>
from the idea ſhe had formed of Mrs. Ulric's character, that were ſhe acquainted with the whole of the caſe, ſhe would rejoice in her deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                        <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ance.</p>
                     <p>Theſe conſiderations determined her to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain her ſecret. She learnt from Thereſa, the name of Mrs. Ulric, and that of the nobleman in whoſe houſe ſhe was confined: and no longer wondered, from what ſhe knew of his intimacy with Sir William, that he had been able, with his aſſiſtance, ſo completely to ſucceed in his plan of ſhutting her up.</p>
                     <p>Some weeks were now elapſed ſince Mrs. Ulric had been confined to her bed, and though the force of the diſorder was abated, ſhe was become ſo lame, that ſhe could not be moved from thence; however, as ſome amendment appeared every day, the time preſſed, for Ellen's beſt hopes of a ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful eſcape were placed on her being able to conceal it for ſome days from Mrs. Ulric.</p>
                     <p>Thereſa and ſhe now daily conſulted upon the beſt means of effecting this eſcape. The abſolute want of money was a great obſtacle; for Ellen was deſirous to purchaſe a peaſant's dreſs of the country, as ſhe hoped, by ſuch a diſguiſe, to paſs wholly undiſtinguiſhed from thoſe with whom ſhe was to mix. Money was not to be procured: but Ellen ſuggeſted the poſſibility of exchanging ſome of her own clothes for thoſe of the kind which ſhe now preferred. This was accordingly accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhed; and Ellen found herſelf in poſſeſſion of all the neceſſary garments. Thereſa had informed her, that until ſhe could get beyond the limits of Bohemia, even the little German ſhe knew would ſcarcely be of any uſe to her: that the Bohemians
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:036127_0374_100852972B997408"/>
hated the Germans, and could never be induced to apply themſelves to the ſtudy of their language, though there were ſchools eſtabliſhed for that purpoſe in ſeveral places; that therefore ſhe would find few people in the interior parts of the country who underſtood it; and though moſt of the farmers who were ſituated on the great roads had a very competent knowledge of German, there were few who would be induced to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſe in it: Thereſa therefore adviſed, that laying aſide all attempts at making herſelf underſtood, ſhe ſhould truſt wholly to the compaſſion which her ſpeechleſs wants might excite, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward which her muſic might be thought to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve.</p>
                     <p>The idea of the latter reſource had alſo been ſuggeſted by Thereſa, whoſe two years reſidence in a Bohemian ſervice had made her very well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the predilection that the lower rank of people in Bohemia bore to muſic. She had ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved Ellen's harp, and had told her that could ſhe carry that with her, a few tunes upon it would ſcarcely ever fail to procure her a draught of milk, or a night's lodging. The harp was too cumberſome for Ellen to think for a moment of burdening herſelf with it: ſhe had therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to ſubſtitute a mandoline, which ſhe had ſent for to Dreſden, and Thereſa fully approved of the ſuccedaneum.</p>
                     <p>Ellen could not help ſhrinking from the idea of performing ſuch a journey as lay before her alone: ſhe would willingly have engaged Thereſa to have accompanied her: ſhe found her perfectly ready to retrace in her company, the ſteps which had led her from her native village: but, beſides that, Ellen, from her ignorance whether Sir William had returned
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:036127_0375_1008529A50888B40"/>
to England, or had continued abroad; was very unwilling to approach Saxony; it being the place where, in the latter caſe, ſhe was moſt likely to meet with him, or with ſome body, who from their connexions with him might know her, ſhe could not conſent to bring Thereſa into a ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation where ſhe would again be a burden upon her friends, when ſhe had nothing in her power to make them any compenſation for ſuch a bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den.</p>
                     <p>There were ſimilar objections to making her the companion of her travels in any other direc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion: for let her part with her where ſhe would, ſhort of England, ſhe had nothing wherewith to reward her, or to aſſiſt her in finding her way home. Ellen's ſecret wiſh was, that Thereſa would accompany her to England; there ſhe doubted not of being able to make her ſuch a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence as would fully repay her for all her trouble and fatigue; but to ſo diſtant a peregri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, Ellen obſerved reluctance in Thereſa, which ſhe was too delicate to try to overcome: and indeed a ſtill farther reflection upon all cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, ſoon reconciled her ſelf-denial with prudence. She conſidered, that if Thereſa ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied her, her eſcape would be immediately diſcovered; and as ſhe had no means of ſpeedy flight, and no place of refuge, ſuch a diſcovery would inevitably lead to a renewal of her cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity. She recollected what Sir William had ſaid in his firſt letter, of the precautions he had taken to render abortive all attempts to eſcape; and ſhe became convinced that her ſafety lay in leaving Thereſa behind her, ſince by her conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuing her attendance in her apartment ſome days after her departure, ſhe would not be obliged to
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:036127_0376_1008529CF5E59798"/>
announce her flight until ſhe was ſecurely beyond the reach of all purſuit.</p>
                     <p>The place from whence ſhe thought it moſt eaſy to eſcape, was the garden-door; ſince Mrs. Ulric had indulged her with extending her walks beyond the garden, all faſtenings had been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved from it except the lock. She ſhewed the door to Thereſa, who aſſured her that ſhe could eaſily find a method of opening that.</p>
                     <p>Every thing was now arranged. It was agreed that Ellen ſhould appear indiſpoſed when ſhe made her laſt viſit to Mrs. Ulric before her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture: and that the ſuppoſed continuance of this indiſpoſition, ſhould be the excuſe that The<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſa ſhould make to Mrs. Ulric for Ellen's unu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſual abſence from the ſick chamber. To give this apology the greater air of truth, Ellen had no ſooner determined upon her flight, than ſhe forebore, under one pretence or other, her daily viſits to Mrs. Ulric: and ſhe even ſometimes ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered two days to paſs without ſeeing her. This was a ſevere affliction to Ellen's grateful and feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heart; more eſpecially as ſhe could not but obſerve that Mrs. Ulric ſeemed caſt down by this relaxation in her attentions; but the neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of the caſe ſilenced her ſcruples, and ſhe conſoled herſelf with the thought that in future ſhe could explain her conduct to her friend, ſo as fully to exculpate her from any charge of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kindneſs.</p>
                     <p>Ellen took from Thereſa a direction to Mrs. Ulric, to whom ſhe determined to write from England an acknowledgment of all the obligations ſhe had received from her, and to ſend her ſome token of her eſteem and gratitude. She alſo put down the name of her faithful Thereſa, and
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:036127_0377_100852A066F92858"/>
that of the place where ſhe might tranſmit the reward of her ſervices, that ſhe meant to ſend her.</p>
                     <p>She next ſtudied all the maps of Germany and Bohemia, which ſhe had in her poſſeſſion; and having learnt from Thereſa the exact ſpot in which ſhe then was, ſhe ſketched out a kind of route for herſelf, as ſomething of a guide to ſteer her courſe by. Here Thereſa could be of little uſe to her; as her knowledge of the country, except by hearſay, was confined to within a few miles of the place they were in.</p>
                     <p>Ellen having made all the preparations for her expedition, and taken all the precaution which circumſtances would admit of, appointed the next morning for her departure. Thereſa packed a ſmall baſket with cold meat and bread, at the bottom of which Ellen put ſeveral trifles, which ſhe thought might poſſibly be of comfort or aſſiſtance to her. She made up alſo as large a bundle of linen as ſhe could carry with any con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venience, both as a ſource of comfort to herſelf, and as a means, if all others failed, of procuring food or lodging. She farther provided a pair of ſhoes, beſides thoſe ſhe wore: and being dreſſed in her peaſant's dreſs, her mandoline flung by her ſide, her bundle under one arm, and her baſket on the other, ſhe quietly deſcended the ſtairs which led from the gallery to the hall, and, accompanied by Thereſa, made the beſt of her way to the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Thereſa eaſily burſt the lock of the door; and Ellen ſaw herſelf at liberty. She turned to embrace her faithful Thereſa, ſaying, 'Oh, my friend, how ſhall I ever repay you? Take all I have to give, as an earneſt, that, when I have more, I will give more.'</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="166" facs="unknown:036127_0378_100852A4A8BBE6F8"/>This <hi>all</hi> was a thin plate of gold, in which the picture of her father was ſet, and which ſhe had looſened from the picture for this purpoſe. It had occurred to her, to make this uſe of it during the courſe of the preceding night, as ſhe lay ſleepleſs and diſturbed with the thoughts that ſhe ſhould be obliged to quit Thereſa, without leaving with her any mark of her eſteem, or any earneſt of what ſhe intended to do for her in future.</p>
                     <p>Thereſa generouſly declined accepting the gold, urging, that it might be of uſe to her: but Ellen felt there was ſo little difference between actual want and the ſafeguard which ſuch a piece of gold would be to her, that no conſideration of this ſort could induce her to forego the pleaſure ſhe had in leaving ſome memorial of her gratitude in the hands of Thereſa. Yet, ſhe afterwards expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, that gold, even of leſs value, was to her of the utmoſt importance. But though Ellen could conceive the preſſure of want, ſhe had not yet felt its weight: ſhe therefore forced all the property ſhe was worth upon Thereſa, and again embracing her,</p>

                     <p>'Oh! Madam,' returned the grateful hearted Thereſa, 'God protect and reward <hi>you. I owe all to you!</hi>'</p>
                     <p>And with theſe memorable words, accompa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nied by a flood of tears, ſhe kiſſed the hand of Ellen: and after watching her move ſome yards from the garden-door, ſhe withdrew, and cloſed it upon her.</p>

                     <p>IT was about five o'clock on a glorious morning in the middle of July, that Ellen thus effected her eſcape from a captivity which had laſted more than three years, and of which the miſeries had been heightened by a ſtroke of misfortune, which would have ſhed a gloom over the brighteſt days of proſperity. Amid the variety of emotions which ſwelled Ellen's heart, at this affecting mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, fear was a very predominant feeling.</p>
                     <p>Habit ſo far triumphed over reaſon, as to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cite a moſt lively alarm, when ſhe thus found her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf wholly dependent on her own powers. Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aided and unprotected, ſhe ſhrunk from the project ſhe had undertaken. She thought for a moment it was above the ſtrength either of body or mind aſſigned to her ſex, and that it was preſumption to have undertaken it. This was but the thought of a moment. The next ſhe ſmiled at the force of prejudice, and the artificial imbecility, and falſe idea of decorum, induced by cuſtom. She conſidered, that in the eyes of all who met her, ſhe was only a peaſant; and could therefore nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther draw on herſelf the gaze of curioſity, nor provoke the obſervations of impertinence; for
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:036127_0380_100852A9117ABF28"/>
that a <hi>peaſant</hi> ſhould make uſe of her limbs in moving from place to place, unattended and alone, was according to rule, and the <hi>eternal fitneſs of things.</hi> To thoſe who knew not that her journey extended farther than from her native village to the neighbouring one, there was nothing daring or unfeminine, in being alone; and in fact the whole of her journey was only to conſiſt of a cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain number of ſuch removals from village to village.</p>
                     <p>Thus the objections of prejudice were pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently ſilenced by reaſon. But there were yet certain difficulties and contingent dangers, which were but too real, and to ſupport herſelf under both, all her natural force of mind, and undoubting reliance upon the ſuperintendance of Providence, were no more than abſolutely neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>She had before her a journey of more than nine hundred miles, without money, without a friend to whom ſhe could make herſelf known, without the means of warding off one evil that might attack her. Should her ſtrength fail, or ſhould illneſs ſeize her, ſhe had not the poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of ſupporting herſelf until vigour returned, or until health was reſtored. She was to depend upon charity for the morſel neceſſary to her daily ſuſtenance, and for her nightly lodging: and from her ignorance of the route ſhe was to take, and the impoſſibility ſhe muſt find in calculating her powers of reaching ſuch places as would af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford ſhelter, it was but too probable ſhe would frequently find herſelf hungry when no food was near, and weary when ſhe knew not where to lay her head. If the public roads expoſed her more to danger, the private paths rendered her more helpleſs, if danger approached<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and to the moſt
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:036127_0381_100852ADAA7B36B0"/>
eligible choice in ſuch an alternative, no wiſdom was adequate. Theſe, and many ſuch thoughts as theſe, alarmed, but did not depreſs the mind of Ellen.</p>
                     <p>With all theſe difficulties and dangers before her, ſhe ſtill thought herſelf happy, that ſhe was no longer a priſoner: and if ſhe had been able to preſerve her equanimity in a more calamitous ſtate, ſhould it deſert her in a leſs. She endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured, by reaſon, to diveſt her ſituation of all imaginary terrors, and artificial hardſhips, and to collect all the powers of her mind to ſupport thoſe which really accompanied it. She reſolved then ſteadily to proceed; making all poſſible uſe of her underſtanding, her patience, and her cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage; but truſting alone for the happy iſſue of her endeavours to that Being, who is the defender of the weak, the ſupporter of the afflicted, and the enlightener of the ignorant.</p>
                     <p>It was Ellen's deſign to proceed to Egra, from whence, as nearly as ſhe could calculate, ſhe was ſomething more than eighty miles. From thence ſhe deſigned her route to be to Frankfort, to Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logne, and through the Low Countries to Hel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voetſluys: here ſhe knew ſhe ſhould find a ready paſſage to Harwich: and as to her further pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings, ſhe left them to be determined by the circumſtances which might ariſe. At the diſtance which ſhe then was from England, it appeared to her, that the moment ſhe ſet foot on its ſhores ſhe was at home: and however impoſſible ſhe might have thought it in former times, to have found her way into Northumberland from Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wich, alone, on foot, and pennyleſs, ſhe conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered that the perſon who had found the means under all theſe diſadvantages, with the additional
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:036127_0382_100852AF32EA1690"/>
one of imperfect language, to make her way from the heart of Germany acroſs the Engliſh channel, was not the one who ſhould diſtreſs her mind with the difficulties which might ariſe in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratively ſo ſhort a pilgrimage.</p>
                     <p>The morning was gay and cheering. Ellen walked leiſurely on: and when the heat of the day induced her to ſeek for reſt, ſhe found a ſhady covert, through which ran a brook, where, unpacking her baſket, ſhe indulged in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment which the friendly Thereſa had pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and ſhe quenched her thirſt with the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the rivulet, which ran at her foot.</p>
                     <p>Having continued in this ſecluded ſpot till the fervor of the day was paſt, and till her wearied limbs began to feel the invigorating effect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment, ſhe again began her journey; and with the ſame leiſurely pace, happily arrived, as the ſun was ſetting, at a ſmall village. Her know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of the ſituation of moſt of the Bohemian villages had induced her, on the ſight of a large wood, to quit the public road in ſearch of one: and her ſagacity was repaid by finding this, at the moment when ſhe moſt wiſhed for ſuch an aſylum.</p>
                     <p>Here ſhe was to make the firſt experiment as to the effect which her muſic would have upon the charitable feelings of the inhabitants. Placing herſelf therefore on a little mound of ſods, which ſeemed raiſed for the purpoſe of a rural ſeat, ſhe took up her mandoline, and began a little wild and lively air. Preſently ſhe found herſelf ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded by half a dozen ragged boys and girls. She changed her notes, and ſet them all dancing. This appearance of gaiety ſoon drew others to partake of it; the dancers increaſed; and, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they ſuſpended their exerciſe, Ellen ſung a
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:036127_0383_100852B1FA7DBD58"/>
few lines of a ſong, or diverſified their amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment by a change in her muſic.</p>
                     <p>She had ſoon the whole village for auditors: and ſingling from among the more elderly part of the company a female, whoſe countenance ſhe thought promiſed well, ſhe aſked, in Engliſh, the favour of a night's lodging. She had not choſen this language from the moſt diſtant hope of being un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, but merely to ſhew that ſhe was a ſtranger, and to draw on a converſation, in the courſe of which ſhe thought ſhe might be able to fall upon a method of making her wants known. Luckily, however, for her, among her auditors, there was one of thoſe numerous individuals, who travel in large parties from Bohemia all over Europe, loaded with glaſſes and trinkets of various kinds, and which they ſell to ſo much ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, that they frequently return with a ſum ſufficient to ſupport them in affluence the reſt of their lives in their native country. This man had, in the courſe of his travels, viſited England, and knew the ſounds which Ellen uttered, were Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh; and with a little cloſer attention was able to make out with perfect clearneſs the nature of her requeſt. He explained it to the woman to whom Ellen had addreſſed herſelf: and it found a ready acquieſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ence from the charitable heart of the poor Bohemian farmereſs, who was moved with Ellen's ſweet ſounds, and pleaſed with the ſoftneſs of her addreſs and the civility of her manners. So true it is, that, however vice may have introduced a variety of tongues, the language of virtue is uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal.</p>
                     <p>Ellen, after thankfully feaſting upon a bowl of milk and bread, was conducted to a ſtraw ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traſs, covered with a rug, which had nothing
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:036127_0384_100852B3912FC7C0"/>
diſguſting or offenſive in its appearance, and with which Ellen, after having thrown herſelf upon the matraſs, covered herſelf. She flattered herſelf, that the fatigues of the day would procure her ſome hours of ſound ſleep. But the novelty of her ſituation, and the fullneſs of her mind, rendered this hope vain. If ſhe cloſed her eyes for a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, the next ſhe ſtarted, and awoke in ſome fancied danger. Her ſlumbers were reſtleſs and feveriſh: and ſhe was happy to riſe with the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt of the friendly houſhold, and after having received a breakfaſt ſimilar to her ſupper of the night before, and paid for it by another tune upon her mandoline, ſhe purſued her journey, taking the beſt directions, as to her route to Egra, which ſhe was able to procure.</p>
                     <p>Three days had Ellen thus wandered alone through the woods of Bohemia; and three nights had ſhe received ſhelter and ſuſtenance from its hoſpitable inhabitants. The timidity which rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon could not wholly ſubdue, had yielded to time. She no longer thought that the eye of every paſſenger was turned upon her. She was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced ſhe was to no one an object of curioſity or wonder. She no longer expected a ruffian to ſtart from behind every tree: and when ſhe ſought a covert wherein to paſs the noon-tide hour, ſhe felt ſecure that ſhe ſhould meet with no in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terruption. Her mind, always alive to the ſim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple delights of nature, began to take a pleaſure and intereſt in the ſcenes amidſt which ſhe wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered. She often lingered under the cover of a thick wood, more from the delight ſhe felt in the ſhade, than any need ſhe had of reſt: and ſhe often prolonged her ſojourn by the ſide of a rip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pling brook, that ſhe might continue ſoothed by
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:036127_0385_100852B51F8D7038"/>
its murmurs, or from being unable to forego the pleaſure of the harmony which reſounded from every branch of the trees with which it was over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhadowed. Often would ſhe compare her preſent mode of travelling with that to which ſhe had been formerly accuſtomed: and her good taſte gave the preference to that which ſhe now pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued. Here no impediments from bad roads, no impoſitions from inn-keepers, no wrangling with poſtillions, no compaſſion for the over-loaded and worn-out horſes, aroſe to diſturb the even tenor of her thoughts, or to ſpoil her reliſh of the beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties which ſurrounded her.</p>
                     <p>But as the taſte of Ellen was genuine, and formed from that love of nature which is the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſult of good ſenſe and a feeling heart, it was pure from thoſe allays of romance, which, while they give a greater currency to what is called taſte, do in fact debaſe its eſſential qualities. While, therefore, as a matter of feeling, ſhe preferred wandering on foot amidſt woods and villages, with no certain path to direct her to the ſhelter ſhe was ſeeking; ſhe fully acknowledged the more certain comfort of a well-built travelling chaiſe, drawn even by miſerable poſt-horſes, along a road which preſented no objects but the regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly placed mile ſtones, and thoſe poſts of intel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligence, which ſo benevolently preſerve the tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veller from going aſtray.</p>
                     <p>The weather, ſince Ellen had begun her pere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grination, had been uncommonly fine; the ſky above was ſerene, the ground beneath dry and firm. Bu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> ſhe was well aware what an altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion a change of ſeaſons would make, not only in her comforts, but in the pleaſures of her ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination:
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:036127_0386_1008387C6B48AC58"/>
and ſhe felt ſometimes, with no little pain, that, though wandering in ſcenes ſuch as ſhe was in at preſent, when it was voluntary, and the ſhelter at hand, might be delightful; yet to the weary traveller, who had no option, and no refuge to flee unto, whatever miſchief might betide, it was attended with danger and inconveniencies, from the feelings and fears of which all its pleaſures would be moſt readily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>linquiſhed. If therefore ſhe were willing and ready to make uſe of the amuſements which of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered themſelves on the way, as the means to cheer the melancholy path ſhe was treading, ſhe was not leſs deſirous to arrive at that haven of reſt, when ſuch alleviations would be no longer wanted.</p>
                     <p>It was not, however, only from the woods, the birds, and the brooks, that Ellen in this for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lorn ſituation derived amuſement to her fancy, or food for reflection. While ſhe marked the extreme poverty of that rank of people with whom ſhe now aſſociated, yet ſaw them tread a ſoil rich with <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                           <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                        </gap> every bleſſing which nature could beſtow, and which aſked but the hand of labour, working for itſelf, to crown them with abundance; how did her heart recoil from the conſequences of that feudal tyranny which makes the many ſubſervient to the few!</p>
                     <p>Yet was her pity often checked, and ſhe was led to think it miſplaced, when ſhe beheld the cheerful good humour of the people, the happy air of their countenances, and the little ſenſe they ſeemed to have, of their wants. In the hopeleſſneſs of their ſtate they ſeemed to find its conſolation. They were at the worſt, and proved how much leſs painful it is to ſuffer, than
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:036127_0387_100852BEC7673BB0"/>
to fear. If the bleſſings of free men were beyond their reach, they were equally ſecure from thoſe ills, the probability of which alarm thoſe who have any thing to loſe. The unfruitfulneſs of the ſeaſons, the devaſtations of fire or of war, all were to fall upon their Lord. They were but another part of his property: and evils which did not affect their perſons, were indifferent to them.</p>
                     <p>'Happineſs, then,' ſaid Ellen, 'is the plant of every ſoil; ſince it will flouriſh even in the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarts of ſlavery. Who, then, ſhall deny that the God of <hi>all</hi> is merciful to <hi>all?</hi>'</p>
                     <p>But Ellen's preſent ſituation called forth re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections more intereſting to her than any benevo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, however warm or extended, or however lively may be the intereſt we take in the pains or conſolations of others, can produce. She had now ſubſiſted three days on charity; and the al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternative for many days to come was ſtarving. A circumſtance to her ſo new, and in general con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered as ſo degrading, could not but fill the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting mind of Ellen with a variety of affecting thoughts. The very people whom the tenderneſs of her heart led her to pity, conſidered her as one degree below themſelves, in the ſcale of human happineſs: and from the very poverty which ſhe regarded with ſo much compaſſion, ſhe received a boon, without which ſhe muſt have periſhed. But, though thrown from her rank in ſociety, Ellen conſidered herſelf not the leſs as maintaining her ſtation in animated nature. She was ſtill one of thoſe beings who are placed only lower than the angels, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>nd who, in the eye of Providence, are all equal. Whatever diſtreſs, therefore, ſhe felt from the ungratified wants of cold and hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, it was unembittered by any ſentiment of
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:036127_0388_100852C08A842768"/>
wounded pride. She conſidered it not as any de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baſement to be reduced to a ſtate in which a God, who is conſiderate alike of all his creatures, has ſeen good to place ſo large a part of them: and it was with equal gratitude to that God, and equal elevation of mind, though certainly not with an equal degree of happineſs, that ſhe now ſtretched forth her hand to receive, as ſhe had before extended it to give. Are we not all alike children of God's mercy, thought ſhe—and ſhall we conceive there is greater dignity annexed to receiving it through one medium than another? On ſome he beſtows his alms by the means of parental inheritance. He gives it to others as the price of their perſonal labours: but they are not the leſs abſolute dependants on his daily bounty, than thoſe whom he appoints the ravens to feed. —He has ordained my preſent ſuſtenance to flow from the charity of my fellow creatures. Let me ſerve him, in receiving, as they ſerve him in giving. The greater bleſſing has been mine. It may be mine again. But in the mean while, let me not grudge it to thoſe, to whom, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent moment, God has granted it.</p>
                     <p>How much ſo juſt and yet ſo uncommon a manner of thinking, contributed to the internal peace of Ellen, in her preſent diſtreſsful circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, may be known by thoſe who have expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced all the pangs a contrary way of reaſoning can inflict; who, in the loſs of every thing that conſtitutes human happineſs, have breathed their <hi>bittereſt</hi> ſighs, from the ſenſe of the <hi>ſhame,</hi> which they falſely imagined to be annexed to a fall from affluence to poverty. But, if there be no ſhame in being <hi>born</hi> poor, how can there be any, where the change is independent of guilt in <hi>becoming</hi> ſo?
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:036127_0389_100852C2673425E8"/>
If there be no ſhame in poverty, innocently in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred, can there be any in receiving the relief which poverty requires?—Can what is the virtue of our fellow creatures be our degradation? Be it remembered, misfortunes may <hi>afflict;</hi> vice only can <hi>degrade.</hi> The one is often the beſt of God's gifts; the other is the work of ourſelves alone.</p>

                     <p>TOWARDS the cloſe of the fourth day of Ellen's wanderings, ſhe began, as uſual, to look around her for thoſe appearances in the country which generally indicated where a village was to be found. She looked but without diſcovering any thing that gave her reaſon to ſuppoſe ſhe ſhould find what ſhe ſought.</p>
                     <p>She was juſt emerged from a thick wood, and had entered upon a kind of heath, which, from its extent and drearineſs, preſented her with an uncomfortable and alarming proſpect. No mark of human habitation, no mark of ſhelter of any ſort, was to be ſeen. She muſt either croſs the heath before her, in purſuit of the refuge ſhe wanted; and to do this would take up a conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable time; or ſhe muſt return into the wood, which ſhe had juſt left, and there take up her abode for the night. Her fears forbade the one; and her wearineſs, ſhe thought, almoſt made the other impoſſible. Terror, however, was, for the moment, more prevalent than fatigue; and ſhe reſolved to attempt to croſs the heath. She had ſtill ſome day-light: and ſhe conſidered, that ſhould ſhe arrive too late in a village to find admittance into any houſe, yet that the ſhelter which ſome out building, or ſhed, might afford her, was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferable,
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:036127_0391_100852CAA514E798"/>
on many accounts, to any which ſhe could hope for in the wood.</p>
                     <p>Ellen ſet forward accordingly: but the wild ſeemed to lengthen as ſhe went: and ſhe became ſo fatigued that ſhe could hardly proceed. To ſtop, however, was what ſhe could not reſolve upon. The evening was dark and louring, and, for the ſeaſon of the year, cold: and while ſhe could move her limbs, ſhe could not conſent to lie down upon the bare and hard ground, without a twig to ſhelter her, and expoſed to all the rain and ſtorm which ſeemed gathering. With ſlow ſteps ſhe went on, and at length reached the other ſide of the heath. She found it bounded alſo by a wood, but not ſo uninterruptedly thick, as that which ſhe had paſſed through before her entrance on the heath. The evening was already too dark to enable her to diſtinguiſh with certainty: but there appeared as if there had been once roads cut through the wood, though they ſeemed now nearly grown up, and the ſpot where ſhe then was, ſhe thought was the entrance of an avenue. Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigued as ſhe was, this thought gave her power to proceed. She flattered herſelf that it might lead at leaſt to ſome ruined building, where, at the worſt, a jutting cornice, or projecting wall, 'juſt nodding to its fall,' might afford her ſome ſhelter from the rain, which now began, at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, to fall very heavily, accompanied with loud and ſudden guſts of wind; nor was the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecture ill founded. After about half an hour's walking, in which time all her outward garments were completely wet through, ſhe found herſelf among the intricacies of ſome building, which ſhe took for the cloiſters of a decayed monaſtery. She troubled herſelf, however, but little in aſcertaining
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:036127_0392_10085388EBB2A158"/>
whether ſhe were right or wrong. There was too little light to enable her to diſcover the truth, if it had been important to her to have known it: but the moſt momentous concern was to find out ſome place where ſhe could reſt her weary limbs unexpoſed to the weather. As the roof of that part of the building which ſhe then was in, was not deſtroyed, ſhe withdrew to the upper end of it: and there, taking off ſuch of her clothes, as were moſt wet, ſhe ſeated herſelf upon a kind of ſtone bench, and began to examine her baſket for ſomething to eat. Luckily it was tolerably ſupplied. She had that morning been ſo much moved by the want of linen in the dreſs of the good farmereſs, who had lodged her the night be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, that ſhe had not been able to forbear, when they parted, preſenting her with a chemiſe of her own; though this was contrary to the prudential rule ſhe had laid down, not to part, in a country where ſhe could ſo eaſily diſcharge her bill with a ſong, with what, in another, whoſe greater riches had baniſhed equal hoſpitality, ſhe might find ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to her ſupport.</p>
                     <p>The woman was ſo much ſtruck with this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected piece of generoſity in Ellen, that ſhe loaded her with a thick ſlice of bread, and a ſmall bottle of milk. Ellen having found equal mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nificence where ſhe had ſought a dinner, had preſerved her morning ſtore untouched: and ſhe now found it a moſt ſeaſonable relief. Hungry and fatigued, however, as ſhe was, ſhe prudently conſumed only half of her riches, preſerving the remainder for the exigencies of the next day. In part, however, ſhe ſupplied the deficiencies of her ſcanty meal by ſwallowing a few drops upon a lump of ſugar, ſhe having had the precaution to
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:036127_0393_1008388A170CDD18"/>
furniſh herſelf with ſuch a cordial, upon leaving the place of her captivity.</p>
                     <p>Having taken all the refreſhment which ſhe thought it prudent to allow herſelf, ſhe lay down to ſleep: and though the floor on which ſhe ſtretched herſelf, was hard and damp, and her pillow only her bundle of linen, ſuch was the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigue of her body, and ſuch the calmneſs of her mind, that in a few moments ſhe fell aſleep. She knew not how long ſhe had continued in this ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, when ſhe was ſuddenly awakened, by ſome noiſe. She ſtarted up, and looked around her, when, to her unſpeakable terror, ſhe beheld by the glimmering of a light, not a hundred yards diſtant, two men carrying a lady, who, by her helpleſſneſs, appeared to be dead.</p>
                     <p>Ellen's heart did not at this moment beat with its uſual regularity: yet her preſence of mind did not deſert her: and conſidering that though the light enabled her to diſcover the objects which were cloſe to it, it was not ſufficient to diſcover her to them in the diſtant and dark corner where ſhe lay. She ſlipped as quietly as ſhe could, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hind a pillar which formed the place where ſhe was, into ſomething of a receſs; and waited the event in ſilence. The men bearing their burden between them, advanced nearer: and Ellen was ſomething comforted by underſtanding from the expreſſions of one of them, who ſpoke in French, the deepeſt marks of grief for the ſituation of the lady. He could not, ſurely, (ſhe thought) be the murderer of one, whom he ſo much deplored: yet, on laying her down, ſcarcely ten yards from the place where Ellen ſtood, and the light ſhining full upon her, Ellen obſerved that her clothes were ſtained with blood: and ſhe fancied ſhe ſaw the
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:036127_0394_100838935BE82658"/>
blood ſtill iſſuing from her boſom, which, from the diſorder of her dreſs, was very viſible.</p>
                     <p>'What will become of me?' (exclaimed the man, who was the only one who had yet ſpoken) 'wretched Antoinette! deareſt creature! How have you reaſon to curſe the hour in which you ſaw me!'</p>
                     <p>Theſe words determined Ellen. She was aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured there was no danger: but there was diſtreſs, and ſhe might be of uſe. Coming out, therefore, haſtily from her hiding-place, ſhe cauſed little leſs conſternation by her appearance, than ſhe had felt upon being firſt ſtartled from her ſleep. 'Suſpend your wonder,' ſaid ſhe in French, to the perſon who ſeemed moſt intereſted, and whom ſhe now diſcovered to be a gentleman, and the other man appeared a ſervant, 'ſuſpend your wonder, and do not fear that I have any connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions that may injure you. I am alone here: but perhaps I have the means to aſſiſt that lady: and I am ſure I have the inclination.' A ready con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence took place of the ſuſpicions which had for a moment alarmed the breaſt of the ſtranger.</p>
                     <p>'Alas!' cried he, 'I can only thank you: but I fear, this miſerable victim of miſguided revenge, is paſt all aſſiſtance.'</p>
                     <p>Ellen ſcarcely waited to hear theſe words. She now ſaw that the lady was really wounded: and ſhe ſeemed to have fainted from loſs of blood. But though the trace of the blood ſtill ſhewed whence it had flowed, it was now ſtaunched. The light enabled Ellen to diſcern, that the place they were in was, as ſhe had ſuſpected, the ruins of a cloiſter: and it formed one ſide of a qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drangle, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>he buildings of the other three ſides of which were nearly deſtroyed. In the midſt of
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:036127_0395_100852CC687FD7F8"/>
this ſquare, had formerly been a fountain, and, though ruined, it ſtill contained water. Ellen ran thither: and filling a ſmall cup which ſhe carried about her, with water, ſhe waſhed the lady's wound; and had the ſatisfaction to find it was ſmall, and did not appear to be deep. She then cut a large piece of a kind of ſticking plaſter, which made a part of her ſtores, and covered the wound with it: and then mixing a little of the water with ſome of her cordial drops, ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived, with the aſſiſtance of the ſtranger, who aided her benevolent efforts with the greateſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiduity, to pour a ſmall quantity down her throat. She then proceeded to chaſe her temples, and rub her hands: and in a ſhort time ſhe was encouraged to continue her endeavours wit ſtill greater energy, by the lady giving evident ſigns of her returning life. In a few moments, ſhe opened her eyes. Ellen gave her more cordial: and in a very ſhort time, ſhe recovered her ſenſes.</p>
                     <p>While this was paſſing, the ſervant, at Ellen's ſuggeſtion, (for the ſtranger, though he imitated and aſſiſted her in all ſhe did, ſeemed to have loſt the power of ſuggeſting any thing) had been fully employed in collecting a few dry ſticks, which was a taſk of ſome difficulty: for the rain of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding night had left nothing in a fit condition to burn, which had been expoſed to it. Luckily however, in his reſearches, he diſcovered ſeveral bundles of dry bruſh wood, and branches of trees, which had been heaped together in one corner of the cloiſter, probably by ſome peaſant, who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to carry them away at ſome future oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity. Of theſe he ſoon ſet fire to a ſufficient quantity to afford the comfort both of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ight and heat. The lady was removed nearer to it, and
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:036127_0396_100852D0321D1DE8"/>
farther from the influence of the air, which blew cold on the open ſide of the building. The lady's clothes were wet: and Ellen had no change to offer her. However ſhe took off her upper gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as ſhe had done her own, and ſpread them all before the fire, while ſhe furniſhed her with ſome linen from her bundle, which ſupplied, though but ill, their place.</p>
                     <p>While Ellen performed the taſk of dreſſing and undreſſing the lady, the two men had retired, but not before the one, who ſeemed the maſter of the other, had aſſured the lady, in German, that ſhe might truſt wholly to Ellen, for that, if ever there were an angel from heaven, ſhe was one. The lady herſelf appeared ſo weak, and ſo confounded, either with what ſhe had paſſed through, or with what ſhe now ſaw around her, that ſhe could utter nothing more than a few broken expreſſions of gratitude, in German, and ſometimes ſome paſſionate exclamations, in a lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage which Ellen did not at all underſtand. Ellen had now an opportunity of obſerving, that this unknown lady was poſſeſſed of a very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon ſhare of beauty; that her form was inex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſibly fine; and that, notwithſtanding her pale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and languor, her complexion and counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance had charms which Ellen thought ſhe had not ſeen equalled. Her dreſs, which was a kind of travelling chemiſe, ſpoke her of affluent for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune; all the materials of which it was compoſed being of the fineſt texture: and the air of conſcious ſuperiority, with which ſhe received the ſervices of Ellen, if it did not give her kind benefactor a favourable opinion of her heart, at leaſt aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſured her, that ſhe was aſſiſting one, who, from the habit of command, entertained the idea,
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:036127_0397_100852D4974EFAE0"/>
that all who approached her were bound to obey.</p>
                     <p>When Ellen had contributed all in her power towards reſtoring her to ſome degree of comfort, ſhe produced the remains of her ſupper, ſpared ſo prudently from her own preſent wants, in refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to thoſe of the next morning. The lady rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily ate the bread and ſwallowed the milk; and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared ſo much revived by the refreſhment they af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded, and ſo fully reſtored to health and vigour, that Ellen ſoon found ſhe had been miſtaken in having attributed the ſtate of inſenſibility, in which ſhe had at firſt ſeen her, to loſs of blood: from what now appeared, it ſeemed more probable that it had only proceeded from fatigue.</p>

                     <p>IT was upon the return of the gentleman to the fire that Ellen had firſt leiſure to obſerve him with any cloſeneſs of attention. She had no ſooner done ſo, than ſhe was convinced that ſhe had ſeen him before: and being perſuaded by his manner of ſpeaking both French and German, that he was not a native either of France or Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>many, an opinion which was confirmed both by his countenance and complexion, ſhe could not doubt but that he was Engliſh. She made this diſcovery with a mingled ſenſation of hope and fear. Again ſhe looked at him, again ſhe liſtened to the tone of his voice. She was more and more convinced that he was not unknown to her: but it ſeemed beyond the power of her recollection to recal his name, or where ſhe had ſeen him. Sud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly, on his throwing himſelf into a particular poſition, it ruſhed upon her mind, that he was the huſband of her elder ſiſter, that profligate man of faſhion and broken fortune, to whom the abſurd vanity of her mother had ſacrificed the happineſs and reſpectability of character of her favourite child. This diſcovery, though the ſtrangeneſs of it threw her into ſome confuſion, relieved her from every fear that ſhe ſhould be
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:036127_0399_100852D83AC17D18"/>
known by him. Ellen had never ſeen him ſince ſhe was fourteen, when he had viſited Groby Manor, for the only time during his connexion with any one belonging to it. She was very ſure that the change which had taken place in her perſon in a period little ſhort of twelve years, muſt ſecurely ſhelter her from any diſcovery from him: for while time had made no other changes in his appearance than what aroſe from a few wrinkles, or a few grey hairs in the place of the darker locks, and ſmoother ſkin, which he had poſſeſſed in earlier youth; it had with her converted a roſy, ſun-burnt, romping, laughing girl, into an ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gantly-formed woman, whoſe pure red and white moſt truly blended, ſhewed in her check, as if the roſe and lily ſtrove for maſtery. All gaiety was certainly at this time baniſhed from her coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance: and her large peaſant's ſtraw hat, which ſhe had now again tied cloſely under her chin, ſo effectually concealed her features, that, if they had been much better known to Mr. Raymond than they really were, ſhe muſt have been ſafe from awakening any recollection in him.</p>
                     <p>As hopeleſs as ſhe knew his return to Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land was conſidered by all his connexions there, and the little probable good which would reſult if he were to return, yet ſhe could not avoid being ſhocked at the proof ſhe had before her, of the licentious life he continued to lead; nor could ſhe help pitying the lady, little conciliating as her manners were, for having formed a connexion, the extent of the iniquity of which ſhe thought it probable ſhe did not know.</p>
                     <p>While theſe thoughts kept Ellen ſilent, the lady and gentleman, having diſmiſſed the ſervant upon ſome meſſage, continued to talk eagerly, and,
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:036127_0400_100852D9F5277BA0"/>
confident in the fancied ignorance of Ellen in the German language, or careleſs of her opinion, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſervedly of their affairs and ſituation. From this converſation ſhe ſoon underſtood, that the lady was by no means deſerving of her pity, on the ſcore ſhe had granted it; for that ſhe was herſelf a fugitive wife, and that having been overtaken in the purſuit made after her by her huſband, an affray had enſued; and ſhe had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a wound in attempting to interpoſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween her huſband and her lover, the latter of whom, becoming deſperate on ſeeing her blood flow, had fired at the huſband; and, as he ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed had killed him. This act of violence, with the farther acts of outrage he and his attendants were on the point of committing, had ſo intimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dated the companions of the huſband, that they had contented themſelves with carrying off his body, without making any farther attempt to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pede the flight of the lovers. The lady having fainted from pain and terror, and it being no longer ſafe to continue in any high road, the lover had been obliged to convey her before him on horſeback, having diſmiſſed all his attendants ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting one.</p>
                     <p>It appeared, from what Ellen heard, that, in the courſe of a journey of more than twelve miles acroſs a country, of which they were ignorant, it had been impoſſible to afford her reſt or refreſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; that ſhe had returned to her ſenſes only to relapſe again into inſenſibility; ſo that the lover had more than once believed her dead. This was an additional circumſtance, which had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden him to ſtop at any houſe: and he had con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to travel on, in hopes of finding ſome ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure and deſerted building, ſuch not being very
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:036127_0401_100852DFB2A59B50"/>
unfrequent in a country once much more popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous than at preſent, where he might in ſafety con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider upon the courſe he had to purſue. Having paſſed through the outſkirts of a tolerably large village, toward the cloſe of the evening, he had ſent his ſervant to procure the means of ſtriking a light, in whatever place they might find it eligible, or might be obliged to ſtop. It was in purſuit of ſome refreſhment, that Ellen found the ſervant was now diſpatched: and the lovers ſeemed to agree, that if they ſaw no reaſon againſt it in the morning, the place they were at preſent in, would ſuit as well as any other, as a place of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge for a few days. They had no doubt but that the purſuit would be renewed with redoubled ardour: and they agreed, that their beſt hope of ſafety was to remain where they were, till their purſuers had overſhot their mark.</p>
                     <p>Hitherto they were ſo much engroſſed by their own concerns, that they ſeemed to have forgotten there was ſuch a perſon in the world as Ellen: but Mr. Raymond now addreſſed himſelf to her, hoping, although he did not, from the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of her ſpeaking French, take her to be a native of the country, that he might be able to obtain, through her means, ſome local informa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. He therefore enquired whether her home was near. Ellen replied, that at preſent ſhe had no home, but was endeavouring to make her way towards a very diſtant one. 'In France?" 'No.' 'In Germany?' 'No.' 'In England?' 'Yes.' 'What the devil!" exclaimed in Engliſh, the profligate Mr. Raymond, 'can then have brought you into the midſt of a Bohemian wild, alone and deſtitute?' 'Misfortune!' ſaid Ellen, ſteadily
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:036127_0402_100852E14DDBD230"/>
fixing her eye upon him, "Misfortune, but not vice!'</p>
                     <p>The conſcious criminal ſeemed to ſhrink into himſelf; but rallying, 'And how, my pretty one, do you mean to find your way from hence to England, in your preſent helpleſs circumſtances?' 'By making the beſt uſe I can of my underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and my ſtrength.' 'A brave girl, faith. If I were not juſt now a little encumbered, I would enliſt you under my banner. I am charmed with your ſpirit.' 'Your pardon, ſir,' ſaid Ellen with calm diſdain, 'I am not ſo ſoon enliſted.' 'Oh! you would go with me. My road through life has been the path of pleaſure. I have lived but to amuſe myſelf. But, put aſide that overſhadowing hat, and let me ſee whether the face is worthy of the form, and the ſpirit that enlivens it.' Ellen without ever ſeeming to hear theſe words, turned to the lady, and aſked in her imperfect German, whether there were any thing ſhe could do towards her farther accommodation. The lady ſomething ſullenly replied, 'No.' And the gentleman ſaid, ſtill ſpeaking in Engliſh, 'You underſtand Ger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man then?' 'Scarcely,' returned Ellen. 'E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough, perhaps, to know what we have been talking of: and if ſo, you may as well know the whole buſineſs. I believe you will not turn in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>former.'</p>
                     <p>Ellen was ſilent; for ſhe felt little curioſity to know more of an affair which ſeemed a compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated tiſſue of profligacy and deſperation. Mr. Raymond, however, who thought the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances he had to bring forward offered a very reaſonable apology for an action which, he could not conceal from himſelf, would be condemned by the general voice of mankind, did not deſiſt
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:036127_0403_100852E5E03DC4D8"/>
from his explanation. 'That angel whom you ſee there,' ſaid he, looking at the lady, 'is the daughter of a beaſt of an Hungarian nobleman, who, to fulfil ſome ambitious ſchemes of his own, forced her into the arms of an old diſagreeable raſcal in high favour with the emperor. What muſt a woman of feeling and ſpirit do in ſuch a caſe? Surely not ſubmit to all the horrors of the worſt kind of ſlavery, becauſe her tyrant was yclept a huſband. I was the happy man, whom the lady fixed upon to aſſiſt in breaking her chains: and with a liberality of mind for which I ſhall ever adore her, ſhe committed herſelf to my honour, loaded with all the jewels and ready caſh which ſhe could collect: and though, at preſent, we are put ſomething out of our way, we hope ſtill to find ſome ſacred ſpot of earth, where the pleaſures of love and the fruits of generoſity may be reaped, undiſturbed by the imagined rights of huſbands and the abuſed authority of parents.'</p>
                     <p>Ellen could not but wonder at the ingenuity that had been able to tell a ſtory of diſobedience, treachery, adultery, and theft, in terms, which on the firſt hearing, ſo little conveyed the nature of the actions they acknowledged. Mr. Raymond was ſo little conſcious that they conveyed it at all, that, without any of that embarraſſment which a perſon leſs hackneyed in the <hi>path of pleaſure</hi> (as he had called the road of vice) muſt have felt in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence of ſuch a confeſſion, that he went on to ſay, that having taken what they hoped would have proved effectual methods to miſlead the huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band into a belief that they had, on leaving Vienna, turned their fugitive courſe towards Italy, they had indiſcreetly neglected to make the beſt of their way towards Dreſden, from the direct
<pb n="192" facs="unknown:036127_0404_100852E88EAE7FC8"/>
road to which place they had deviated as a mean; of farther ſecurity; and that they had, the day before, been overtaken, at a moment when they conceived themſelves in perfect ſafety. He then proceeded to detail the whole particulars of the affray which had enſued, and to relate, that when he found himſelf in danger of being purſued, not only as a raviſher, but as a murderer, he had ſent forward their carriage and their baggage, under the care of a ſervant, in whom he could confide, to Dreſden, there to wait his farther orders; and in the mean time to ſpread a ſtory, that the lady was dead, and his maſter gone, he knew not whither; that in the haſte, in which they were obliged to make their arrangements, they had not been able to ſecure any part of their property, except the lady's jewels, which were in her pocket, and what little money they had about them. 'And now,' ſaid this gallant hero of a ſtory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of crimes, which, more than any other in the whole roll of guilt, are, from their own na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and the injurious effects they have upon the intereſts of ſociety, the juſt objects of the greateſt abhorrence; 'and now, if fortune will but ſmile for a few days, we may ſtill baffle the malice of our enemies. My intention is, to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſervant I have ſent to Dreſden to join us as ſoon as poſſible, at Straſburg, from whence we will ſhape our courſe to ſome more dear retreat in the mountains of Switzerland, and there,
<q>'The world forgetting, by the world forgot,'</q>
we will remain alive only to love and happineſs.' Love and happineſs! thought Ellen, how widely have I been miſtaken <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                        <pb n="193" facs="unknown:036127_0405_100852EBC0599980"/>It was eaſy to be perceived, that this long diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe of her lover, in a language of which ſhe did not underſtand a word, was by no means pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the lady. She broke in upon it by ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing which ſhe ſaid very peeviſhly to him, and which Ellen did not perfectly underſtand. Ellen now began to wiſh impatiently for the morning, that ſhe might eſcape from the conſequences of a proof ſo pregnant, how infinitely preferable the moſt helpleſs ſolitude may be, to much of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety that is to be met with in the world. Yet how often had ſhe heard Mr. Raymond exalted as the moſt pleaſant of his ſex! how often had ſhe heard Mrs. Mordaunt declare, that he had not a fault but in the eyes of thoſe rigid mortals who hold pleaſure as a vice, who refuſe to enjoy the bleſſings which are given them, and who ſeek heaven by abaſing the nobleſt of its works! Alas! thought Ellen, how fatally would he have been awakened from the falſe peace into which his flatterers have lulled him, had not the raſh paſſion of his unworthy companion interpoſed between his life and the juſt indignation of an injured huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band!</p>
                     <p>Light, at the ſeaſon of the year when theſe events happened, is ſuſpended for ſo ſhort a time, that had it not been for the ſtorms of the preced<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing evening, which ſtill filled the ſky with thick and heavy clouds, Ellen would have been very ſoon able to have purſued her wiſhes of quitting her new acquaintance. But the firſt hours of the morning were dark; and it continued to rain in ſome degree. Before theſe obſtacles to her de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture were removed, the ſervant returned with a quantity of milk and bread, which he had pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed at a village a few miles diſtant. Ellen was
<pb n="194" facs="unknown:036127_0406_100852EED3533460"/>
invited to partake of this refreſhment, which, in fact, ſhe wanted as much as any of the party: and in the courſe of the meal, Mr. Raymond, who really did poſſeſs a part of that kindneſs of human nature, which had gained him the appel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation of 'the beſt-humoured fellow breathing,' expreſſed much genuine ſolicitude for the deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute ſituation Ellen appeared to be in. He felt this the more, as, though he could draw nothing from her to confirm ſuch a ſuſpicion, he was ſtrongly perſuaded, in his own mind, that ſhe had been accuſtomed to a rank of life, which could not have prepared her to ſtruggle with her pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent difficulties. Although ſhe had been very ſparing of her ſpeech, her accent, her manner of expreſſion, and tone of voice, all aſſured him of this, and ſtill more the eaſe and ſoftneſs of her manners. He ſettled in his own mind her pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable ſtory to be, that, having left her own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try as an occaſional companion to a perſon of his own principles, but who poſſeſſed leſs of that compaſſionate good humour for which he had been often complimented, and upon which he piqued himſelf, ſhe had, by the change of incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and want of generoſity in her companion, been reduced to her preſent difficulties. There was ſomething, indeed, in the nice ſenſe of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety which ſhe appeared to have, and which was evident even to one who had loſt all ſuch feelings from his own mind, which militated againſt this idea. But as it was ſomething beyond meaſure ſtrange, that a perſon of real faſhion and character could be left by any, the moſt diſtreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing occurrences, in the ſituation Ellen was now in. He thought it was taking the leſs improbable ſide, to ſuppoſe, that her former way of life had
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:036127_0407_100852F05C2B8088"/>
not entirely obliterated all traces of thoſe feelings which once adorned her ſtate of innocence. This ſuppoſed ſituation of Ellen did not in the leaſt make her a leſs intereſting, or even leſs eſtimable object in the eyes of Mr. Raymond: and he even felt ſomething of an additional deſire to aſſiſt her, from the proof ſuch aſſiſtance would be to all his acquaintance, that there is ſometimes a ſentiment of kindneſs in the breaſts of thoſe called wicked, towards the diſtreſſed, which the more rigidly virtuous are without. In conſequence of theſe reflections, Mr. Raymond began to preſs Ellen to attach herſelf to their party; and hinted, in pretty intelligible terms, that beſides all the difficulties and diſtreſſes which would probably attend her finding her way back to England, ſhe would find it almoſt impoſſible, conſidering the circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces in which ſhe would arrive there, to form any eligible eſtabliſhment. Whereas he had no doubt, if ſhe ſtaid with them, that he ſhould ſoon be able to introduce her to a friend, who would make her forget all ſhe had loſt. Although all this would have been perfectly plain to the apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Ellen, had ſhe been the ſort of perſon Mr. Raymond took her to be, yet being entirely ignorant of all that could lead her to his true meaning, and much of what he ſaid applying to her real ſituation, ſhe at firſt underſtood his of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers only in a general ſenſe: and when, by the turn and ſtrength of the expreſſions, ſhe began to comprehend that there muſt be ſome particular meaning intended to be conveyed, ſhe was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely at a loſs to gueſs what that meaning could be. The character of the man who addreſſed her and the manner of his expreſſions, however, perſuaded her, there was ſomething diſgraceful
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:036127_0408_100852F1ED14C968"/>
in the protection he offered her: and as ſhe was too wiſe to think of ſhewing her reſentment, ſhe contented herſelf with coldly and ſteadily ſaying, ſhe was indiſpenſibly obliged to endeavour to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to England, as ſoon as poſſible; and that when there, ſhe was aſſured ſhe ſhould want nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther protection nor friends, The unmoved man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of Ellen, and the little countenance that the lady gave to this plan of Mr. Raymond's, at length obliged him to ceaſe from further urging it. And ſoon after, the ſun breaking forth in all his ſplendour, Ellen repacking the bundle, and re-adjuſting her baſket, roſe to depart. 'We cannot ſuffer you to go,' ſaid Mr. Raymond, 'without making a ſmall acknowledgment for the obligations we are under to you. If you would have gone with us, I would have done much for you: but now, ſo low are our finances reduced, that, except our jewels, I equally divide the whole of our ſtock, when I offer you this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fle.' In ſaying theſe words, he preſented Ellen with a ducat. Ellen's firſt impulſe was to refuſe it, ſo far did habit make her forgetful of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance ſhe then wore. But Mr. Raymond added, 'No, no,—no refuſals—while you ram<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble amongſt theſe wilds indeed, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>Ellen then took the ducat. But Mr. Raymond, who felt his ſolicitude increaſe for her every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in ſpite of, or perhaps ſtimulated by, her reſerve and coldneſs, ſaid, 'Devil take me, if I am not aſhamed to part ſo. Stay; would it not be poſſible to convey you a bill to Cologne? Do
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:036127_0409_100852F735EBB600"/>
you mean to take Cologne in your way?' Ellen re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied ſhe did. 'The moment we think it ſafe to quit this retreat,' ſaid he, we ſhall bend our ſteps towards Straſburg. We ſhall be there in much leſs time than your poor little feet can carry you to Cologne. Come, give me your directions: and at La Savage you ſhall be ſure of finding, on your arrival in that place, a bill for a ſum ſufficient to procure you an eaſy conveyance to England, and to any part of it to which you may chooſe to go.' Ellen heſitated. The performance of ſuch an offer would annihilate half thoſe difficulties and dangers which ſhe dreaded ſo much to encounter. 'Such a ſupply,' returned Ellen, 'would indeed be extremely acceptable to me. But as, on my return to England, I ſhall be perfectly able to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn any pecuniary obligations I may receive, I cannot accept your offer, however grateful I may be for it, except you will put me in ſome method of repaying the money, when I no longer ſtand in need of it.' Mr. Raymond regarded her with increaſed wonder. 'I would give the world to know who you are,' ſaid he, 'and what has brought you into this deſart; for I am confident you are no common one.' 'You ſhall know who I am,' returned Ellen, 'and all I have under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, when I return you the money: and then you will acknowledge that the human mind may ſupport any deſtiny, however hard, which has not been brought on by miſconduct.' 'I believe you are a parſon in petticoats,' ſaid Mr. Raymond. 'No,' returned Ellen, 'I am no parſon; but I am a kind of a propheteſs: and I foretel that you will never know happineſs until you return to your wife and children.' Mr. Raymond retreated a
<pb n="198" facs="unknown:036127_0410_100852FA012BBA78"/>
few ſteps, as if he recoiled from a dread of ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pernatural power. 'I ſaid, when firſt I ſaw you, you were an angel: but now I believe you deal with the devil.' 'You ſhall know my dealings at ſome future hour,' ſaid Ellen; and giving him a paper, added, 'this is my direction: now give me yours.' 'And muſt I wait till a future hour for the explanation of ſo much myſtery?' ſaid Mr. Raymond. 'You muſt.' 'Well then, let it not be very diſtant.' He then gave her a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection to himſelf, under the name of Maſon, at a particular hotel in Straſburg: and with reiterated wiſhes that her journey might prove more proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perous than it promiſed to do, he at length ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered her to depart.</p>
                     <p>This adventure did not appear half ſo ſingular in the eyes of Mr. Raymond, as it did in thoſe of Ellen. The circumſtance of finding himſelf known to her, confirmed his former ſuſpicions: and he had no doubt but that the ſtory which ſhe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed him, would only be a detail of the ingrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude and cruelty of ſome man of his own ſet, with whom he had aſſociated before he left London. But Ellen was ſtruck in no common degree with the ſingularity of meeting in the woods of Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mia a man ſo nearly allied to her, in circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces ſo diſgraceful, that ſhe could not avail herſelf of their connexion to the alleviation of her own diſtreſſes: nor could ſhe forbear adverting to the power ſhe had had, of adminiſtering, from her ſcanty pittance, to the wants of two people, who, had it not been for their vices, might have been in poſſeſſion of every comfort and every accommoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion this world can afford.</p>

                     <p>THIS adventure furniſhed Ellen with ſufficient food for thought, as ſhe walked on: and as the day was much cooler than any ſhe had yet expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rienced, ſhe continued her journey, without tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her uſual reſt at noon. Fortunately ſhe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at a decent village early in the evening: and here ſhe reſolved to take up her repoſe for the night; the fatigues of the preceding day and night having made reſt abſolutely neceſſary for her. In anſwer to the inquiries ſhe made here, ſhe had the ſatisfaction to find, that ſhe had not deviated very widely from the direct road to Egra. She had fixed upon this place, merely as a point, by which to direct her enquiries: but there was nothing ſhe wiſhed ſo much to avoid, as large towns and cities; and being now pretty well ſkilled in the beſt man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of going from one village to another, without ſtraying too far diſtant from the public road, ſhe contrived, in about fourteen days from the time of her eſcape from captivity, to enter Franconia, without having paſſed through Egra, or ſuffered much either from fatigue, hunger, or alarm. Having thus happily accompliſhed what ſhe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to be ſomewhat above the firſt hundred miles of her journey, ſhe drew a lucky preſage
<pb n="200" facs="unknown:036127_0412_100852FD53263CA8"/>
for the remaining eight. But accuſtomed as ſhe now was to being alone, ſhe felt a dread of that part of her travels, which was to lead her among the more thickly inhabited parts of the road, more than any one of the dangers which awaited her in the obſcure foreſts and ſolitary paths. The obſervation of Mr. Raymond often returned to her mind: and when ſhe reflected on the different treatment which the beggars wandering through the populous ſtreets of a great city uſually meet with, from that ſhe had experienced in the Bohe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mian wilds, ſhe could not help drawing a conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, that a cloſe neighbourhood was not favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to the virtue of hoſpitality.</p>
                     <p>Theſe reflections made her view her ſingle du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat with a ſigh. But ſhe reſolved, as long as the ſale of her linen, her mandoline, or the poor du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cat in queſtion, could preſerve her from the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of it, not to aſk charity in any town. Ellen continued her method of travelling with tolerable ſucceſs; though ſhe found a very ſenſible differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the appearance and manners of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. The latter was more populous, it was bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter cultivated, but beggars were more numerous, and ſimple hoſpitality leſs. Although ſhe was readily relieved at a door, ſhe no longer found it ſo eaſy to be admitted under the ſhelter of a friendly roof: her muſic was leſs an equivalent for all the kindneſs which was ſhewn her. Ellen, who could not pay for a lodging, and whoſe ſoul recoiled from aſſociating with the herds of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon beggars who ſo frequently croſſed her way, was therefore neceſſitated often to content herſelf with what accidental cover ſhe could find, and which frequently amounted to nothing better than what a wall afforded, where, with her head upon
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:036127_0413_1008530464A04FF0"/>
her bundle, ſhe often ſought for that ſleep which ſhe could not find; and, ſometimes, overcome with fatigue, even in this expoſed and comfortleſs ſituation, ſlept ſoundly.</p>
                     <p>Theſe frequent ſleepings, expoſed to the open air, or in ſituations little ſheltered from the weather, made more ſubſtantial clothing neceſſary. She durſt not part with the only piece of money which ſhe was poſſeſſed of; for however ſhe might hope ſhe ſhould receive the ſupply promiſed her by Mr. Raymond at Cologne, ſhe was too prudent to act as if ſhe were certain of it. Her mandoline ſhe now found of little uſe to her: and ſhe was therefore reſolved to make that the firſt ſacrifice. Its real value was ſmall: and, in her preſent circumſtances, ſhe was not likely to get even that value for it. But ſhe thought herſelf happy in exchanging it for a rug cloak, which made a part of her bundle in the day, and covered her warmly over at night.</p>
                     <p>Thus ſhe paſſed through the heart of Germany, keeping on the north of the Mayne, and directing her courſe towards Frankfort. She found the little German which ſhe at firſt poſſeſſed, very ſerviceable to her: and ſhe daily increaſed her ſtock; ſo that ſhe now found no difficulty in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaining her wants. Indeed her difficulties did not lie in explaining, but in relieving them: and they every day became more numerous and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſing. Her firſt pair of ſhoes were almoſt worn out. Her clothes grew thin: and though, from habit, ſhe could now walk more miles in the courſe of a day, than ſhe could, when firſt ſhe ſet out, ſo long a continuance of hardſhips and fatigue began to have an effect upon her ſtrength, and ſtill more upon her ſpirits. The hope which had
<pb n="202"
                            facs="unknown:036127_0414_10085305EB34F960"
                            rendition="simple:additions"/>
at firſt buoyed her up, began to ſubſide: for as ſhe reflected upon the diſtance there was ſtill between her and England, ſhe began to think it impoſſible, that her powers of ſtruggling with the difficulties which ſurrounded her, would continue to her journey's end. A degree of deſpondency fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed ſuch thoughts: and this increaſed the very evils ſhe feared. She endeavoured, however, to rouſe herſelf; to awaken hope once more in her heart; and to derive all the comfort from her undiminiſhed reliance on the goodneſs and wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Providence, which ſuch reliance was cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to afford. She adverted to the extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary circumſtance of her having met with Mr. Raymond, and the aſſiſtance it was probable ſhe ſhould receive from him: and ſhe was not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>willing to yield to the degree of ſuperſtition which induced her to believe this might be one mark of the ſuperintendance of Providence, which, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther evident or not, ſhe never for a moment doubted.</p>
                     <p>Having revived her hopes, and ſtrengthened her courage by ſuch conſiderations as theſe, ſhe purſued her way towards Frankfort, but following her original plan, ſhe entered not that place, but turned aſide to a village not far diſtant, where ſhe arrived in ſomewhat leſs than a month from the time when ſhe had entered Germany. Here ſhe heſitated whether ſhe ſhould proceed to Mentz, and from thence attempt taking a paſſage on the Rhine. The eaſe this would be to her, was her ſtrongeſt inducement: but ſhe doubted whether the ſale of all ſhe was worth, would enable her to defray the expenſes of her voyage: and the queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion recurring, what ſhe ſhould do, when thus without any reſource, but the precarious one of
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:036127_0415_100853077740D620"/>
charity during the reſt of her journey, ſhould ſhe find herſelf diſappointed of the promiſed ſupply at Cologne, determined her to truſt to her feet ſome time longer. She directed her courſe, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, as nearly as ſhe could, towards the Rhine, thinking it prudent to be within reach of the only mode of conveyance, which her circumſtances would allow her to avail herſelf of, however her ſtrength might fail, or her health ſink under her fatigue.</p>
                     <p>The romantic and highly cultivated country which this determination led her through, could not be viewed by Ellen, even in her preſent ſtate of depreſſion, without the liveliſt emotions of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>light. The pictureſque ſituation of the villages, the ſtriking forms of the hills, each crowned with a caſtle, the vineyards, the cheſnut groves, all formed a ſcene ſuch as ſhe had never before wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, and which filled her mind with images of beauty perfectly new. She obſerved, however, the extreme inequality which a wine country pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duces in its inhabitants, even of the ſame rank. And the ſplendid ſituation in which ſhe ſaw ſome of the peaſants, did not in her eyes compenſate for the ſight of the many poor people with which ſome of the villages ſwarmed. This was a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, however, in which Ellen herſelf fared very well. She often gathered cheſnuts enough to ſerve her for a meal, when no other was to be had: and wine ſhe ſometimes received gratis, and at others could purchaſe for a trifle. She found no difficulty in exchanging ſome of her linen, either for a little money, or for ſuch food as was neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary for her. It was, however, with the greateſt economy that ſhe made uſe of this reſource. But by the prudent management of that, never forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:036127_0416_1008530A2702CD18"/>
the conſideration of the future hour in the wants of the preſent, and of the other means which were in her power, ſhe was enabled to move on proſperouſly, though ſlowly, towards her point. The beauties of the country leſſened as ſhe approached Cologne: and when ſhe ſet her foot within that dark and ugly city, her heart ſunk, from a mingled ſenſation of diſguſt and fear. To wander, unknown and unprotected, through the diſmal and half deſerted ſtreets of this decay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing place, where ſhe was ſurrounded by falling and empty houſes, appeared to her infinitely more dreary and depreſſing than all the thick foreſts and extended wilds which ſhe had hitherto paſſed. She would have inſtantly quitted a place ſo unconge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial with her feelings, and ſought ſhelter in ſome of the numerous farm houſes which ſurround its walls, and where ſhe might have refreſhed herſelf with milk and vegetables, had ſhe not been eager to aſcertain what ſhe had to hope from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Mr. Raymond.</p>
                     <p>With ſome difficulty ſhe inquired her way to the hotel, to which he had given her a direction; and ſoon found, with more grief than ſurpriſe, that there was no letter for her. The very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious circumſtances in which ſhe had left Mr. Raymond ſufficiently accounted for the breach of his promiſe to her: and without accuſing him of any intentional deceit, or criminal neglect, ſhe withdrew, congratulating herſelf upon the pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with which ſhe had huſbanded her little ſtore, and which ſhe now found was to be her only dependance.</p>

                        </gap>red the hotel, ſhe had obſerved two carriages, which ſeemed by their appearance, and the people who were employed about them, to belong to ſome traveller of diſtinction: but ſhe had paid little attention to them. On her return, however, one of the ſervants ſtood ſo directly in her way, that ſhe was obliged to ſtop till he removed. The moment he ſaw he was a hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drance to any one, he made way with a civility which Ellen was conſcious was not paid to her appearance. On her thanking him, he turned ſuddenly round, as if ſtruck by the tone of her voice; when, what were her emotions when ſhe knew him for the perſonal ſervant of Mr. Villars! The man marked not the confuſion into which he had thrown her; for no ſooner did his eyes ſweep haſtily over her dreſs, than he ſeemed to have abandoned the thought which had before ſuddenly occurred: and he returned to his buſineſs, which was diſpoſing ſome parcels within the carriage, with undivided attention.</p>
                     <p>The effect that ſuch an unexpected rencontre had upon Ellen, was ſo great, that for a moment ſhe was unable to ſtir: but recollecting herſelf, ſhe conſidered that ſhe had no proof that this
<pb n="206" facs="unknown:036127_0418_10085311003C45B0"/>
perſon was ſtill in the ſervice of Mr. Villars, and that if he were, there was nothing ſhe ought more to avoid, than the diſco<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ring herſelf to him.— Theſe thoughts made her remove from the place which ſhe was in, as ſpeedily as her trembling limbs would allow. But ſhe felt it impoſſible to quit Cologne, without being aſſured whether or no Mr. Villars was there. She therefore took ſhelter in a baker's ſhop, which was immediately oppoſite the hotel, and where ſhe hoped ſhe might be allowed to remain, until the carriages moved off, eſpecially as it was plain, from the buſtle among the ſervants, that this would ſoon take place.</p>
                     <p>Many and divers were the thoughts which oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cupied Ellen, as ſhe watched from her retreat the motions of the people employed in making the neceſſary preparations for their departure. If the maſter of thoſe ſervants ſhould prove Mr. Villars, the deſire of diſcovering herſelf to him, ſeemed almoſt irreſiſtible. Her neceſſitous ſituation, the nearneſs of his relation to her, the perfect inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence which had always accompanied the whole of their intercourſe, made her in one moment de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cide, that ſuch ſubſtantial advantages as would ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crue from her making herſelf known to him, were not to be ſacrificed to punctilios and the fear of miſconſtruction. But the reflections of the next inſtant corrected this too flattering, but unjuſt concluſion. Whether ſhe were ever again to live with Sir William, or whether ſhe were to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularly ſeparated from him, her juſtification and her all of happineſs in this life, would depend upon being able to clear every hour of her life from ſuſpicion. Her return to England with Mr. Villars would make this impoſſible. Her ſenſe of
<pb n="207" facs="unknown:036127_0419_100853138633B138"/>
propriety alſo revolted from the idea of making the man, who had never ceaſed to be her lover, the firſt confidant of Si<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> William's jealouſy and ill uſage. A converſation between them on ſuch a ſubject muſt place them equally in the moſt critical and embarraſſing circumſtances. It muſt unavoidably recal ideas and ſentiments which nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ought to feel and ſtill leſs to avow. Regret and reſentment muſt ariſe in the breaſts of both, when canvaſſing the conſequences of a marriage, which had broken aſunder all the ties that love had formed between them: and it could hardly be ſuppoſed, that the lover would not be tempted to ſeek revenge for the injuries done to the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of his affections, where the natural relation which he held to her, would ſeem to give him a right to be the puniſher of her oppreſſor.</p>
                     <p>Ellen ſaw ſhe had but one reſolution to take: but ſcarcely ever before had ſhe found her will ſuch a rebel to her reaſon. While ſhe was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in theſe reflections, ſhe obſerved, that a lady's maid was alſo buſied about the carriages. Ellen's firſt thought, on ſeeing her, was, that ſhe might have ſpared all her debatings. Henry was not near her; for Henry was not married. The next reminded her of the length of her abſence from England, and of her ignorance of all that had taken place there during that period. This thought was followed by another. If he was mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, all objection to making herſelf known to him would vaniſh. She ſtepped out of the ſhop with a deſign to make an enquiry of one of the ſervants, when her better reaſon cauſed her as haſtily again to enter it. There was no doubt but that Mr. Villars believed her dead. It was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain what would be the effect upon him of her

If the firſt wiſh of Ellen's heart had been, to make the happineſs of Henry her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; it had long given place to a ſecond, little leſs fervent, that of ſeeing him happy with ſome worthy object, who, in deſerving all his love, might poſſeſs, and return it. Probably he had now found ſuch a one: and no perſonal inconvenience could weigh with Ellen againſt the ſlighteſt ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of an interruption of their mutual happineſs. She reſolved, therefore, to give up every thought of diſcovering herſelf to him: but ſhe waited in breathleſs impatience, and with an agitation not to be deſcribed, the moment which would clear up all her doubts. She waited not long. Scarcely had ſhe decided to remain concealed, when the maſter of the carriage appeared. It was Henry himſelf! He was in deep mourning, and, lean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing familiarly upon his arm, was a young genteel looking woman, in deep mourning alſo. Ellen's heart beat: ſhe gaſped for breath. Henry aſſiſted his companion to get into the carriage: and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately jumping after her, the door was ſhut, and they were driven away full ſpeed. The other carriage drove up; two ſervants entered it; and with two others on horſeback, followed the firſt carriage.</p>

<pb n="209" facs="unknown:036127_0421_1008531ADA4BA0E0"/>
wholly unknowing where ſhe meant to go. A few moments brought her to her recollection. But ſuch was the indeſcribable anguiſh which had ſeized her, that for ſome time ſhe thought, in the varied vexations of her diſtreſsful life, ſhe had never known ſo bitter a moment as the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent. To have been obliged, in the helpleſs and wretched ſtate ſhe was in, to ſuffer him who would have been the ſofteſt ſoother of her ſorrow, her warmeſt friend, her moſt ſtrenuous protector, thus to depart unaſſiſtant to her wants, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſcious of her diſtreſs, preſſed ſo heavily on her mind the ſeverity of her fate, and ſhewed her to herſelf ſo far removed from all human aid, that, for a time, even her ſtrong and well-diſciplined mind was not able to bear up againſt ſuch a weight of wretchedneſs. If Cologne had before ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared diſguſting, it was now become inſupportable. She hurried to get beyond its hated walls. The three claſſes of people, beggars, eccleſiaſtics, and nobles, into which its inhabitants are divided, were all alike indifferent to her: nor was the ug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs or deſolation of the city itſelf any longer objects of attention or ſoliloquy. Her mind con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained but one idea: Henry carried rapidly from her when ſhe moſt ſtood in need of his friendſhip and aſſiſtance. No other thought found admiſſion into her mind. She felt, ſhe ſaw, ſhe thought of nothing elſe.</p>

                     <p>WHEN Ellen got again beyond the city walls, ſhe ſeemed to breathe more freely: the tumult of her mind began to ſubſide: ſhe began to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, that no new misfortune had befallen her; that ſhe was in no reſpect worſe in conſequence of what had happened; that Henry, placed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power of aſſiſting by diſtance, or by ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, was the ſame thing in effect; and that if ſhe had been able to bear the one with patience, there was no reaſon why ſhe ſhould find the other intolerable.</p>
                     <p>Having thus reſtrained that power of imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, which is never indulged but to our hurt, with a recompoſed mind ſhe began once more to call a council of her own thoughts, as to what was the beſt method in which to proceed. Her fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances ſeemed to allow her little choice: and ſhe reſolved, keeping as near to the Rhine as poſſible, to make the beſt of her way to Nimeguen, and from thence to Helvoetſluys. But the days were now conſiderably ſhortened: a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

obliged to ſacrifice what would have procured her a meal, to the now almoſt equally neceſſary com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of a lodging ſecured from the weather. She ſtill avoided reſting in any towns; and made her way from village to village, which, in the popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous and cultivated country which lies n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> the Rhine, between Cologne and Nimeguen, ſhe found it not difficult to do: nor had ſhe reaſon to complain of want of humanity or charity in the people. Her gentle manners, her being a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reigner, and above all, the languor and melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly which had now too ſtrongly taken poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of every feature, ſeemed to plead irreſiſtibly in her favour. To a night's lodging, and a bowl of milk in the morning, were often added, on diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſing her, a few ſtivers, or a ſlice of bread which ſerved for her dinner. The money ſhe carefully hoarded; for her paſſage to England was perpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually in her mind, and the means when there, which ſhe ſhould take to arrive in Northum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berland.</p>
                     <p>In this manner and by ſlow degrees, ſhe reached Nimeguen, without any material evil, or extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary adventure. It was at Nimeguen that ſhe had croſſed the Rhine, when ſhe travelled with Sir William: and ſhe was well acquainted with the different routes to be purſued, and the manners of the people in Holland. But ſhe well knew the difference of ſituation in a country where nothing is to he had without money, between the wife of a rich Engliſhman of faſhion, and a poor mendicant, whoſe very exiſtence depended upon the charity of others. That country where a man pays for the few moments that his great coat lies upon a bench, cannot be very favourable to the wants of any individual, who does not contribute ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:036127_0424_10085322E560FC28"/>
to the great ſtock of national wealth: and Ellen could not condemn the principle, which made a nation hard-hearted to beggars, whoſe very exiſtence depended upon the induſtry of all. The little ſuſtenance ſhe took, ſhe therefore con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived to pay for: and as the cheapneſs of a convey<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance by the trechſcuits enabled her to avail her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of them, as a ſuſpenſion of her hitherto never-ceaſing fatigue, ſhe reached Helvoetſluys eaſily and ſomewhat recruited in ſtrength. Fortunately ſhe arrived only a few hours before the ſailing of a packet, in which ſhe eaſily procured a paſſage, and at an expence proportionate the meanneſs of her appearance. The only paſſengers of any faſhion were a gentleman and lady, who had few attendants, and appeared not to be rich. Both the lady and her only female ſervant were ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferers in the greateſt degree from ſea ſickneſs: and as Ellen was happily free from all indiſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and the only woman beſides themſelves in the packet, ſhe attended them, at the requeſt of the lady's huſband, in the cabin; and afforded them all the aſſiſtance and comfort in her power. The paſſage was proſperous, and not of the longeſt kind: and when they landed, the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in conſideration of Ellen's cheerful attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance upon his wife, and judging by her clothes, that ſhe was by no means above receiving a ſmall gratuity, gave her, before they parted, five ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings.</p>
                     <p>Ellen was now in England. But the emotion with which ſhe once again put her foot upon her native land, after ſo long and ſo diſaſtrous an ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, were not thoſe of unmixed joy, or even of very cheerful hopes. During her tedious and difficult journey, ſhe had ſeldom had leiſure, from
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:036127_0425_10085325A22C9C88"/>
the preſſing wants of the paſſing hour, to turn her thoughts upon the fate which might await her, if ever ſhe ſhould ſo far ſurmount thoſe wants as to accompliſh the purpoſe ſhe had in hand. But now, when nearly all her difficulties were over, and her neceſſities drawing to a concluſion, the ſituation which ſhe ſhould find her friends and family in, with what might be the reſolutions that circumſtances, or the requiſitions of Sir William might call for on her part, filled her mind with anxiety and dread. So far from knowing what to hope, ſhe knew not what to wiſh: and if the idea of being regularly ſeparated from Sir William, and being allowed to live unmoleſted with her father, by occurring the moſt frequently to her imagination, ſeemed to ſay that this was really what would be moſt acceptable to her; there were ſo many conſiderations which checked the riſing deſire, that it amounted not to a wiſh.</p>
                     <p>She had a child! (at leaſt ſhe hoped ſhe had) and for the ſake of this child ſhe would have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to have been placed in a ſituation much more repugnant to her feelings than a re-union with Sir William would place her in. Even of Sir William's conduct towards her, ſhe was cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of forming a too decided opinion: and if it could be proved, that he had been miſtaken, and not malicious, ſhe felt nothing within her unre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentful heart, which ſhould prevent her endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vouring, by a life of duty and affection, to obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terate from the minds of both all the miſery which they had mutually cauſed each other.</p>
                     <p>It was impoſſible not to think of theſe things. It was impoſſible that thinking of them ſhould not ſink her to the loweſt degree of ſadneſs: but
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:036127_0426_1008532890053240"/>
it was equally impoſſible, that ſhe ſhould form one probable conjecture, how ſhe ſhould in future be induced to act. Her impatience, however, to bring her fate to an iſſue, increaſed to a feeling of the moſt painful kind. But, although in Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, ſhe was ſtill more than two hundred miles from that home where ſhe could alone be ſure of a kind reception, or where ſhe could inform her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf of thoſe circumſtances upon which the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of her future life muſt depend. To appear as a beggar in a country, the laws of which pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide ſo amply for the wants of the indigent, as at firſt ſight ſeemed to render it impoſſible that vice and beggary ſhould be disjoined, and where thoſe very laws, acting as it were upon this ſuppoſition, make the very act of aſking charity criminal, and aſſign a puniſhment for it, was a ſituation which to Ellen appeared intolerable.

                     <p>She had, indeed, during the ſad reflections which occupied her mind on this ſubject, during her paſſage from Holland, debated whether ſhe ſhould not, on her arrival in England, make her caſe known to ſome magiſtrate: and it is probable ſhe would have had recourſe to this method, ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than have appeared in the character of a va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gabond, had ſhe continued as entirely deſtitute as ſhe was previous to the gift of the five ſhillings. But ſhe was very thankful to be ſaved from this extremity: ſince, reſolute not to have told a falſe tale, ſhe muſt have been obliged, both againſt her inclination and judgment, to have told at leaſt ſo much of the truth, as might have led to diſco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veries, which, ſhe was ſenſible, ought to be made

only to her neareſt relations, and moſt aſſured friends; ſo ſeaſonable and ſo important was a gift, in itſelf ſo ſmall, that probably the giver would ſcarcely place it, in balancing his account, on the ſide of charity. With theſe five ſhillings, which had proved a mine of wealth to Ellen, and by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>NOTWITHSTANDING the lateneſs of the ſeaſon, the paſſage proved a happy and tolerably ſhort one: and Ellen at length beheld herſelf landed within thirty miles of Groby Manor. But ſhe was now abſolutely pennyleſs, nor did ſhe poſſeſs a ſingle article of clothes, for which, in the opulent and money-getting town of Newcaſtle, ſhe would have been able to have found a purchaſer. Her ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections to appearing as a common beggar, ſeek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her bread from door to door, were as ſtrong in Northumberland as in Eſſex, and the fear of applying to any perſon in any of the higher ranks of life ſtill ſtronger. It appeared impoſſible to her, that ſhe ſhould be able to tell ſuch a ſtory as would entitle her to any thing beyond the moſt common relief, to any perſon in her own coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, without leading to queſtions, which would either involve her in falſehood, or lead to the diſcovery of too much truth. One valuable ſhe was ſtill poſſeſſed of: this was her wedding-ring: and though it had only been the ſeal of miſery to her, ſhe felt an extreme reluctance to parting with it. But ſcruples and ſorrows founded only in imagination, ſhe was in the habit of ſubduing. Her reaſon acknowledged that the giving up her
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:036127_0429_100853306699F158"/>
wedding-ring was the moſt eligible method of ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying her preſent wants of any in her power. She was within a few yards of a ſilverſmith's ſhop. She turned towards it. She ſtopt for a moment at the door. She dreaded to encounter the curioſity ſhe was aware the application ſhe was about to make would excite. She heſitated. The ſame thoughts paſſed through her mind. But now compelled by the conviction, that every other way to relieve her diſtreſs, was ſtill more objectionable, than this, ſhe entered the ſhop. She entered it however with a look of ſo much embarraſſment and irreſolution, as drew on her the notice of the man who kept it. It was not until he had enquired twice in words, and with a manner perfectly civil, what ſhe wanted, that ſhe had courage enough to advance towards him. Then taking off her worn-out glove, and drawing her ring from her finger, ſhe ſaid, with heſitation, 'If, Sir, you will let me have three ſhillings, or half a crown, upon this ring, I ſhould think my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf much obliged to you.' She ſaw the man's eyes fixed inſtantly upon her hand, the whiteneſs of which, with the delicacy of its form, ill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded with the ſhabbineſs of her garments, and the diſtreſs her preſent application indicated. 'I am not accuſtomed to take pawns, Madam,' ſaid the man. 'Perhaps then,' replied Ellen, 'you would give me the value of its weight, Sir?' 'It muſt diſtreſs you, Madam, to part with your wed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding-ring,' returned he, looking earneſtly in her face. 'I would not willingly part with it en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely,' ſaid Ellen: 'If therefore you would be kind enough not to diſpoſe of it for a few days, I ſhould take it as a favour. In leſs than a week I
<pb n="218" facs="unknown:036127_0430_10085334DEC68A40"/>
hope to be able to repurchaſe it.' 'No, Madam, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>aid the man, 'I will not take your ring. You are ſo like a lady who is dead, and who was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways better than her word, that I will take yours for ſo ſmall a ſum as this,' laying down five ſhil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings, 'and if I ſhould loſe it, I will think it is given to that lady, and I ſhall be very well ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied.' Ellen, aſtoniſhed and embarraſſed, thought herſelf diſcovered; and, eager to remove from the earneſt ſcrutiny of her new friend, haſtily took up the money; and ſaying, 'I am indeed extremely obliged to you, Sir, I will take care not to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credit your friend,' ſhe haſtened out of the ſhop: ſhe ſaw that the man followed her to the door of it, and attentively watched her. She therefore turned, as ſoon as ſhe could, into another ſtreet, and with a beating heart and trembling limbs, took ſhelter in the firſt ſhop that preſented itſelf, which could afford her any refreſhment. Here, as ſhe purchaſed ſome rolls, her thoughts were buſily employed in endeavouring to recollect the features of the ſilverſmith, who, ſhe was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuaded, muſt have ſeen her before, and whom, it was probable that in her happier days ſhe had befriended. Suddenly the remembrance of the grandſon of old Deborah croſſed her mind: and in the kind relief juſt now granted her, ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cogniſed the gratitude and worth of that honeſt young man. Cheered by the recollection of an act of benevolence, which, from the ſeaſonable return it had produced, ſeemed to have placed her in a particular manner under the protection of Providence, Ellen purſued her way with a mingled ſenſation of delight and hope, which had long been a ſtranger to her boſom. The five or
<pb n="219" facs="unknown:036127_0431_10085336655BA8E0"/>
ſix and twenty miles which now lay between her and the haven where ſhe hoped to repoſe, after all her ſufferings, however it might have appeared ſix years ago as a gulph not to be paſſed by her, in circumſtances like the preſent, now ſeemed little more than a needle's point. She felt no difficulty. She apprehended no danger. She thought every object familiar to her. She imagined that ſhe muſt know every face that ſhe paſſed; and almoſt expected to be called by her name by every per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhe met. The day, however, was ſomewhat advanced, and night came on, when ſhe was ſtill ſixteen miles from Groby Manor: ſhe eaſily pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured herſelf a decent and comfortable accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation for the night (for ſhe was now rich, and could pay ſumptuouſly for what ſhe wanted): but ſleep, which had often viſited her under the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect ſhelter of a wall, or when expoſed to the droppings of a tree, now fled the warm comforts of her preſent chamber. The thoughts of the next day filled her mind, and held her eyes waking. She aroſe with the firſt rays of light, and reſumed her journey.</p>
                     <p>It was a bright froſty morning, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of October; all nature looked chearful, and Ellen's heart, which ſtill retained the impreſſions ſhe had received in the ſilverſmith's ſhop the day before, partook of the cheerfulneſs around her. As ſhe walked forward, theſe ſenſations ſubſided; and gave place to the fears which the probable changes that had taken place during the laſt four years in the home to which ſhe was returning, naturally gave riſe to. The day paſſed on. Ellen drew every hour nearer to that ſpot, where alone, in the whole courſe of her life, ſhe had known
<pb n="220" facs="unknown:036127_0432_1008533957033470"/>
happineſs, and where only ſhe could hope, if ever happineſs were to be hers again, to find it. Her emotions increaſed every ſtep ſhe advanced. Sometimes ſhe was obliged to ſtop for the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhment which the failing powers made neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary; at others to remain a few moments mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionleſs where ſhe was, without the power of ſeeking any.</p>

                     <p>THE evening approached; and the diſtant chimnies of Groby Manor appeared. 'If time,' ſaid Ellen, 'has not changed the habits of the dear inhabitants of that beloved manſion, this is the hour when they are about to aſſemble round the ſocial tea board. Now the evening muſic, or the evening lecture begins. Oh! beloved friends! there awaits you an interruption to your pleaſures, which will be infinitely dearer to you than them all.'

did not fear finding her entrance barred. The tumult of her mind was ſuch, that her deſigns might rather be called impulſe than reaſoning: and as ſhe aſcended the hill, her limbs could hardly ſupport her trembling frame. She reached the top. She drew near the houſe. A plane tree was placed ſo near one of the windows, as to prevent all objects beyond it from being ſeen from thence. It was on this ſide that Ellen ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proached. The window immediately behind the plane tree was open: Ellen intended, or thought ſhe intended, entering through it. She advanced. Her tremblings increaſed. She was obliged to ſupport herſelf againſt the trunk of the plane tree. She heard the ſound of an inſtrument. She could ſee within the room; ſhe looked; at the harpſichord ſat the very lady whom ſhe had ſeen accompanying Mr. Villars ſix weeks before into his chaiſe at Cologne. Mr. Villars himſelf was at that moment behind her chair: and hanging upon her gown was a playful little girl. In ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther part of the room, ſat Mrs. Raymond at work, and near her Mr. Mordaunt, and two young girls, who were alſo at work. Ellen remained ſpeechleſs, motionleſs, and gazing intently upon what ſhe ſaw, and yet unconſcious that ſhe ſaw any thing. Every faculty was ſuſpended. A temporary ſtupor had ſeized her.</p>
                     <p>At this moment, one of the girls raiſing her head from her work, ſaw a figure under the plane tree. 'Who's there?' ſaid ſhe, in a voice of affright. 'It is I,' ſaid Ellen; and ſprang for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward: but could do no more: ſhe ſunk lifeleſs on the window frame—'What ſounds are thoſe?' cried Henry.

is <hi>this</hi> my Ellen?' 'Ellen,' ſaid the aſtoniſhed and bewildered father, 'Gracious God! haſt thou ſuffered her to leave thy manſions of bliſs, to comfort her afflicted parent?'</p>
                     <p>Ellen was laid upon a ſofa; but ſhe continued ſenſeleſs; nor were thoſe who continued gazing round her more conſcious of exiſtence than her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. One of the young people, leſs intereſted than the reſt in the ſcene before her, ran for aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance. The room was preſently filled with ſervants. Ellen began to revive. Henry kneel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing before her, had ſeized both her hands. 'I have found her; I have again found her,' repeated he; 'and no power on earth ſhall part us more.' Ellen heard him not; ſhe ſaw him not: ſhe ſaw only her father; and with a ſudden motion threw herſelf at his feet. He claſped her in his arms. 'It is herſelf! ſhe is alive! Oh! bleſſed God! what wonders are theſe!' Although Ellen's worn-down frame was little able to ſupport ſuch violent and affecting emotions, yet, being prepared for the ſcene, ſhe was the firſt to recover ſome degree of compoſure. 'I am indeed reſtored to you,' ſaid ſhe, 'by little leſs than a miracle. Let us not, by our own vehemence, make vain all that God has done for us;' and looking around her, ſhe ſeemed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand whether ſhe ſaw all the family that time and abſence had ſpared. Her father preſſed her to his heart. 'You will ſee your ſiſters. They are married; they are happy. But your mother —(let us not repine)—inſtead of a mother's em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braces, receive thoſe of your daughter.' 'My daughter!' ſaid Ellen rapturouſly, 'is this my daughter?' The lovely child was already in her arms. 'Deareſt infant!' ſaid Ellen: and, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come by the pai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

riſing ſob checked her voice, and ſhe burſt into tears. 'Then you, Madam,' ſaid ſhe, as ſoon as ſhe could again ſpeak, and addreſſing herſelf to the young lady whom ſhe had ſeen at the harpſichord, 'then you, Madam, are not the mother of this beloved baby?' 'Her mother!' returned the lady: 'how cruel has fortune been, thus to make ſtrangers of ſuch near relations.' 'She is my ſiſter,' cried Henry, 'my youngeſt ſiſter, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act image of my Ellen, the darling of my heart.'</p>
                     <p>There was a queſtion which Ellen longed to aſk, yet knew not how. The manner and words of Henry, ſo different from any he had ever uſed ſince ſhe became a wife, ſuggeſted a thought, which ſhe knew not how to expreſs; and by the variety of emotions it excited, preſſed upon her heart with a weight which was intolerable. She threw herſelf into her father's arms, and, hiding her face in his boſom, 'Oh! my father,' ſaid ſhe, 'where is Sir William Ackland? Where is my huſband?' 'Be compoſed, deareſt creature,' ſaid Mr. Mordaunt. 'It is perhaps happy for us all, that he can no longer anſwer for his conduct in this world.' Ellen became ſuddenly ſick. 'Let me retire, I beſeech you,' ſaid ſhe. Poor unhappy man!' (tears running down her cheeks) 'miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taken, or cruel, I equally pity you.' Mrs. Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mond and Mr. Mordaunt withdrew with Ellen: and Henry accompanied her to the door of Mrs. Raymond's room, carrying the little girl in his arms, from whom Ellen could not bear to be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parated a ſingle moment. Ellen was unable to ſupport herſelf any longer: and, at her own re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, ſhe was put to bed, and all parties being in poſſeſſion of the great outlines of thoſe events which it moſt concerned t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="225" facs="unknown:036127_0437_1008534703B95E80"/>
explanation was, by mutual conſent, deferred. Mrs. Raymond could not conſent to quit Ellen's bed-ſide during the night, in ſpite of her remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrances, who told her, ſmiling, ſhe was much more accuſtomed to be left wholly to her own care, than ſhe could be to ſpend a night in watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. 'In this bed, in this room,' added ſhe, 'with a table covered as that is, with every thing that can tempt the appetite, or mitigate the pains of ſickneſs, I am much more likely to be ſleepleſs from aſtoniſhment, than from any fear or want of accommodation.'</p>
                     <p>Mrs. Raymond, who could not feel the full force of this obſervation, yet underſtood enough of it to be unable to reſtrain her tears, at the thoughts of the former hardſhips to which Ellen alluded. 'It ſeems ſo impoſſible,' returned ſhe, weeping, 'that you ſhould be really here, that were I to leave you for a moment, I ſhould not expect to find you on my return.'</p>
                     <p>Henry was no ſooner appriſed by Mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt, that he muſt not hope to ſee Ellen that night, than he ſet off to the parſonage. The tale he had to tell, was ſo beyond all credibility, that his friends there for ſome minutes believed him raving. But ſeeing nothing in his looks or man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to confirm ſuch an opinion, their feelings be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came little leſs agitated than his own. The fact which he ſo conſtantly averred, that Ellen was alive, and at Groby Manor, he pretended not to account for or explain: and though they began to be convinced that he doubted not the truth of what he ſaid, yet they could not perſuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, that he was not by ſome means deceived. They reſolved, therefore, to verify his words by the
<pb n="226" facs="unknown:036127_0438_100853488CD10D38"/>
evidence of their own ſenſes: and, late as it was, Mr. and Mrs. Thornton, and Mary, who (although ſhe had been married a twelvemonth) ſtill conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued at the parſonage, reſolved to accompany him to Groby Manor. Mr. Mordaunt had taken his ſtation in a corner of Ellen's bed-chamber: for to ſeparate from her he found to be impoſſible: and he thought the loſs of ſleep amply recompenſed by ſeeing her breathe, and ſometimes hearing her ſpeak. Miſs Villars and the two young Ray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monds were in the parlour, waiting the return of Henry. They confirmed to the wondering Thorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tons the events of the evening: and their mutual joy and aſtoniſhment, with the variety of excla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mations and conjectures that engaged them, ſo perfectly baniſhed all deſire of ſleep and reſt from the whole party, that it was determined they ſhould ſit up together for the remainder of the night. Henry and Mary often ſtole gently to the door of Ellen's room. They liſtened. All was quiet. They hoped ſhe ſlept. They returned to the parlour to communicate their hopes to their friends; and then again crept to the door to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm them to themſelves. Ellen, however, was ſleepleſs: but the quiet ſhe impoſed on herſelf enabled her to collect her thoughts, and to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare for the renewed emotions of the next day.</p>

                     <p>THE next day at length came: and Ellen found her bed inſupportably irkſome to her. She could no longer delay the knowledge of a thouſand particulars ſo intereſting to her, and ſo important to her happineſs: nor was the impatience of her friends much leſs than her own. Mrs. Raymond furniſhed her with clothes; for whatever Ellen could have done, none of her family would have borne to have ſeen her in thoſe tattered and worn-out garments, which were ſuch painful indications of the hardſhips ſhe had ſuffered.</p>
                     <p>The reſult of the reflections ſuggeſted through the whole of Ellen's wakeful night, had been a determination to learn from her father, in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation between themſelves, all the circumſtances attendant on Sir William's death, and the actual ſituation of Henry; it having appeared plainly to her, in the few words which ſhe had yet heard him utter, that his ſentiments towards her were the ſame as ever, and that his hopes of poſſeſſing her, were now again riſen as high as in the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt days of their mutual affection. But Ellen had too long been accuſtomed to place the curb of reaſon upon her wiſhes, to ſuffer them alone to influence her actions. She had long ceaſed to conſider Henry as her lover: but ſhe had never
<pb n="228" facs="unknown:036127_0440_10085350E83430C8"/>
ceaſed to entertain for him that friendſhip, which his virtues and his love towards her ſo well de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. If affliction had ſubdued her paſſions, it had awakened her affections. She was now a mother: and ſhe felt that no conſideration on earth could tempt her to any act which might, in its remoteſt conſequences, be prejudicial to that dear infant, ſo newly found and ſo highly che<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhed. If, in her early youth, ſhe had yielded her partiality for the man of her choice, to a ſenſe of the duty he owed his parent, ſhe well knew now how to make it ſubmit to that which ſhe owed her child. But it was poſſible that duty and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination might at length agree. Ellen's heart flattered her at the thought: but ſhe ſuffered it not to riſe into a wiſh. She would have no wiſh on this ſubject unſanctioned by her father.</p>
                     <p>Ellen was ſcarcely dreſſed, when ſhe deſired to ſee him: and the enraptured, yet anxious parent, flew to obey her ſummons. She begged Mrs. Raymond would leave them together: but ſhe placed her little girl upon her knees. 'I cannot fear,' ſaid Ellen to herſelf, 'any faulty impulſe of my heart, while I hold to it this pledge and reward of its rectitude.' As Mr. Mordaunt viewed the languid and travel-worn figure of El<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len, as he conſidered the paleneſs of her cheek, and the heavineſs of her eye, his emotions almoſt choaked him. 'Oh! my child,' ſaid he, 'what muſt you not have ſuffered, and for what?' 'Tell me, my father,' ſaid Ellen, 'how long you have ſuppoſed me dead?' 'We were taught to believe you died in bringing that infant into the world.' 'And did Sir William appear afflicted for my loſs? and where and how has he lived ſince? and, above all, did he not in dying give
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:036127_0441_100853526FC0B758"/>
you ſome reaſon to ſuppoſe I exiſted?' 'He did not return to England till a twelvemonth after your ſuppoſed death; and then for the ſole pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of placing his child under the care of a rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his mother's: and it was not until after I had repeatedly urged him, by every motive I could imagine, to afford me the ſatisfaction of ſeeing him, that I could prevail upon him to make me a viſit. I was then attending your mother in her laſt illneſs: I could not go to him. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained here only two days, and appeared the moſt wretched of men. I repented that any conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for ſelf had induced me to force him into a viſit which ſeemed ſo painful to him. Yet there was ſomething in his grief which ill ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>corded with mine. It had more of fury and deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peration in it than ſoftneſs. Once, and only once, I attempted to lead him to ſpeak of you. He ſtarted from his chair, "Oh! name her not, ſhe has undone me! ſhe has ruined my peace for ever! Worthy old man," continued he, "you know not how fatal a gift you beſtowed, when you gave me your daughter!" I believed the violence of theſe expreſſions to be the ravings of grief for a loſs, which my own ſufferings told me mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

"She does not bear her name. She will not, I hope, bear her features." 'Oh! I hope ſhe will,' returned I fondly: 'and in time, Sir William you will find comfort in what now, perhaps, might be too lively an emblem of what you have loſt.' He ſeemed almoſt convulſed with paſſion: "No more," ſaid he, "if you would not drive me to madneſs." I ſought to ſoothe
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:036127_0442_1008535516CC6918"/>
him: and moſt carefully, during the ſhort time he afterwards ſtaid with me, did I avoid a ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject which I now ſaw he could not bear. He re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained ſome months in London: and I heard from every one of the deep ſhade of grief which was impreſſed on his behaviour and countenance. He quitted England the following ſpring, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned to it no more. Four months are ſcarcely paſt ſince he died ſuddenly, with no previous ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, at Vienna. I was informed of the event by a Bohemian nobleman, whom I underſtood to have been Sir William's intimate friend. There were ſome words in this gentleman's letter, of which I never, until now, could gueſs the mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, but which muſt certainly have alluded to the unhappy miſtake, from which my beloved child muſt have ſuffered ſo much, and which appears to have made Sir William's life entirely wretched. Theſe words ſeemed to intimate, that had Sir William been allowed any time for death-bed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections, he might have been induced to have mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tigated the ſeverity of ſome determination, the juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of which had not been ſufficient to ſatisfy him under the rigour of it. I conſidered this intima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion merely as a ſort of apology for ſome action of Sir William's which might ſome time probably come to my knowledge, which his friend was conſcious would ſtand in need of one.'</p>
                     <p>'I found,' continued Mr. Mordaunt, for Ellen broke not in upon his diſcourſe, 'that the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians appointed to your dear infant were people unknown to me, and wholly unconnected with my family: and it ſeemed as if Sir William wiſhed to keep her as far apart from every one of us as poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible. But my heart longed to ſee her: and our dear Henry, who has been my guardian-angel under

all my troubles, and is now the ſupport of my declining age, procured me this bleſſing, as he has done many others. He prevailed upon the lady with whom ſhe is placed, to truſt her to the care of his ſiſter and himſelf, when they were about to make a viſit to Northumberland: they have been with me ten days: and there has not been an hour in any one of theſe days, in which Henry and I have not ſoothed our never-ceaſing regret, by endeavouring to trace your features in the lineaments of that infant's face.'</p>
                     <p>Ellen felt that her heart was not indifferent to this panegyric upon Henry. 'And Lord Villars,' aſked ſhe, 'does he ſtill purſue the ſame projects of ambition and avarice, ſo often defeated but never given up?' 'Lord Villars,' repeated Mr. Mordaunt,' 'do you not know—but alas! you cannot know—there is now no other Lord Villars than Henry.' 'Gracious heaven!' ſaid Ellen; and her pale cheek became ſtill paler. 'He died of a liver complaint about three months ago,' con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued Mr. Mordaunt. 'His death was foreſeen: and Henry croſſed the channel to bring home his ſiſter, who had been ſome time abroad with Lady Edwards: but Lord Villars died before they could return, before indeed Henry had reached the place where his ſiſter then was. Since his return to England, he has been wholly taken up with his family affairs: and it was not 'till within theſe ten days, that he had leiſure to give me, what he knows to be my beſt comfort, his dearly beloved ſociety.' 'But, dear ſir,' ſaid Ellen, 'my brother, what of him, does he afford you no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort?' 'None, Ellen, none. He and lady Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meria have no reliſh for the ſhades of a northern

retirement, or for the ſociety of an old man, though that man is their father. Their life is one unvaried round of diſſipation and expence: and the only ſatisfaction I reap from their union is, ſome times the company of ſome of their children, of which they have three.' 'My ſiſters?' ſaid Ellen. 'Are happily, though not ſplendidly, married. They are both ſettled in this country; and do every thing in their power to make my old age comfortable. My daughter Raymond and her two girls are kind and good to me. And now,' cried he, claſping her in his arms, 'ſince I once again embrace my Ellen, there is nothing this world has more to give.' 'And I,' ſaid Ellen, 'if I can bleſs the declining years of my father, and guard the opening dawn of this dear child, what more ſhall I have to aſk in this world?' 'Oh! my Ellen," returned the delighted parent, 'you have much more to aſk, and much more to do. You have to reward, I will not ſay the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy, for that may be objectionable, but the virtues of our Henry. Happineſs too is in long arrears to you: and you may now reaſonably aſk for payment.' 'But can I,' ſaid Ellen, 'give my child another parent? Can I hazard her welfare on the ſhock of intereſts, ſo often the conſequence of a ſecond connexion?' 'Who would you ſooner chooſe for a parent to your child,' returned Mr. Mordaunt ſmiling, 'than Henry? Who would you rather make the guardian of your deareſt intereſt than him? But I leave him to plead his own cauſe. My Ellen muſt have un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergone a wonderful metamorphoſis, indeed, if ſhe find in her breaſt any impediment to his wiſhes from miſtaken delicacy, or weak punctilio: and

It was fortunate they did ſo: for ſo great had his emotion become, that he could not have ſupported Ellen another moment. Mr. Thornton claſped his arms round her: the beloved Mary received her ſinking head upon her boſom; while Mrs. Thornton, half frantic with her joy, deluged her with perfumed water one moment, and ſtifled her with careſſes the next. A moment's conſideration convinced them all, that Ellen was unfit to be removed down ſtairs. They therefore agreed to aſſemble in Mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt's library, which was immediately oppoſite the bed chamber aſſigned to Ellen. Henry could not, however, prevail upon himſelf again to quit her: and having regained ſteadier nerves, he car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried her, with the aſſiſtance of Mr. Thornton, into the library, where being laid upon a ſofa, a few moments ſufficed to recompoſe her mind.</p>
                     <p>'I could not have ſuſpected myſelf of ſo much debility,' ſaid ſhe ſmiling, 'and when I come to tell you what I have been doing for the laſt three months, you will agree with me, that I have little right to ſuch fine lady-like airs.' 'Oh!' cried Henry fervently, 'you are weak. We all are weak from feelings no fine lady ever knew.' In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the groupe who were now gathered round Ellen, ſeemed to have forgotten all conſideration of ſelf, in the thoughts of the beloved object they encircled. Mr. Mordaunt had drawn a low ſtool
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:036127_0448_100853667349FD58"/>
cloſe to the ſofa; and held Ellen's hands in his. Henry was leaning over the back of it, with his eyes intently fixed upon her face. Mary was upon her knees, preſſing cloſe up between Mr. Mordaunt and Ellen; while the reſt of the party had diſpoſed of themſelves into a kind of outward circle, and all were alike emulative of the pleaſure of adminiſtering to Ellen's wants. One idea ſeemed to prevail with them all, that the miſeries ſhe had ſuffered, and the hardſhips ſhe had under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gone, called for every indemnification in their power. Ellen had ſcarcely any voice, and, bathed in tears, was unable to look up. 'I have not,' ſaid ſhe, in broken and interrupted accents, 'in all my ſorrows, ſhed ſo many tears from grief, as I now ſhed from joy. But indeed I muſt not indulge myſelf. I muſt ſhake off this weakneſs. Yet who can wonder that the ſenſe of the mercies I have received, is ſo overcoming?'</p>
                     <p>Impatient as the whole circle were to be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the every particular of Ellen's fate, they all, with one voice, declared againſt the indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence of their curioſity 'till ſhe was ſomewhat <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>ore reſtored to compoſure. But ſhe was aware, that this would never be, while ſhe had ſo inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting a ſtory to relate. 'Believe me,' ſaid ſhe, 'that nothing is ſo likely to huſh theſe contending feelings as the dullneſs of narrative. I ſhall per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps fatigue myſelf with the length of my ſtory: but ſuch fatigue will be ſalutary. I want ſleep. Mine has been long broken, and for the two laſt nights wholly interrupted. If I can talk myſelf to ſleep, there is nothing from which I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſo much benefit: and to ſleep, while I have ſuch a ſtory to tell, is impoſſible.'</p>
                     <p>The party drew cloſer round her: and Henry,
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:036127_0449_1008536978C9B458"/>
half invited, found a ſeat on the ſofa, at her feet, as, ſupported by pillows, ſhe changed her poſture from that of lying down to a ſitting one. It can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be doubted what were the emotions with which Ellen was liſtened to. Pity, admiration, grief, indignation, and aſtoniſhment, ſucceeded each other: but when ſhe came to relate the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtance which ſeemed to have ſealed her fate, and of which being abſolutely ignorant, ſhe was at a loſs whether to impute it to miſtake, or contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, Henry, in an agony he could not reſtrain, threw himſelf on his knees before her. 'Oh! my Ellen,' cried he, graſping her hands, 'my ſuffering, my ever-beloved Ellen, do not, do not hate me! I am the wretch who have undone you. I conducted you to that hateful priſon. I cloſed its doors upon you. Your agonizing days, your ſleepleſs nights, were all the gift of my hand. But, Oh! if you cannot pardon me, do not, do not hate me.' 'Oh! Henry,' replied Ellen, gently returning the preſſure of his hand, 'be aſſured I never entertained a ſentiment of <hi>hatred,</hi> even to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the <hi>real</hi> author of my ſufferings. How then ſhould I hate <hi>you?</hi>' 'And can you forgive me? And do you call me your dear Henry? Mr. Thornton pray for me: I ſhall not keep my ſenſes.' 'Nor,' ſaid Mr. Thornton fervently, 'ſuffer Ellen to keep hers. Can you admire the ſtrength of mind, which has ſupported her through<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſuch trying ſcenes, and yet deſert yourſelf ſo pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiably?' 'But I was not tried with joy,' ſaid Ellen, holding out her hands towards Henry (who had haſtily let them go, on hearing Mr. Thornton's rebuke), 'and thoſe, who have felt them both, know how much more difficult it is to bear joy
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:036127_0450_1008536C70F3C8B8"/>
than ſorrow.' Henry's tears rolled down his cheeks. He endeavoured to conceal his face as he ſtooped to kiſs again and again the dear hands he held. 'Say,' cried he, in accents ſcarcely ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulate, 'ſay you forgive me for all my faults.' 'Let us not talk of forgiveneſs,' returned Ellen: 'and but this once ſuffer me to aſſure you, that you have lightened my heart of the ſingle remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing weight that oppreſſed it, by clearing the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory of a man whom I would not condemn from the imputation of the only act of <hi>villainy</hi> with which I could charge him. It is eaſy to pardon injuries originating in miſtake, and a miſtake too, which I underſtand has coſt the unhappy perſon ſo deceived ſtill more than it has coſt me.' Henry then explained how fatally his ſcrupulous atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the delicacy and peace of Ellen had ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded. He remembered the contents of lady Almeria's note; though he could not at that diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of time call to mind the exact terms of it, upon which Sir William's miſtake was grounded. The good heart of Mr. Mordaunt rejoiced equally with Ellen's, that there was ſo ſtrong an appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of impropriety in the conduct of Henry, as to juſtify the confirmation it had given to thoſe injurious ſuſpicions which had, however, been before moſt unjuſtifiably taken up. Without ſuch an apology, Sir William muſt have appeared one of the worſt of men. But neither Mr. Mordaunt, nor the chriſtian Mr. Thornton, much leſs could Henry, admit of any excuſe for the method he had taken to gratify his revenge, nor the right he had aſſumed to himſelf of ſo cruelly puniſhing offences for which the laws of his country have appointed a much leſs ſevere chaſtiſement. Nor will it be expected that the females of the party were more
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:036127_0451_1008536E4FEA3BE8"/>
favourable to ſo <hi>illegal</hi> a proceeding: and Ellen, though ſhe did not chooſe to join in the condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, entered not into defence of a conduct which ſhe conſidered as indefenſible. In men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioning the adventure in the ruined monaſtery, ſhe carefully avoided mentioning the name of Mr. Raymond, though ſhe expatiated on the happy circumſtance it had proved to her, in procuring her the ducat, which ſhe had found of ſo much uſe. It was with the greateſt emotion that ſhe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated what ſhe had felt on the ſight of Henry at Cologne. 'And could you, did you,' echoed from every mouth, in ſuch 'circumſtances, in ſuch diſtreſs, could you ſuffer him to depart without making yourſelf known to him?' 'What could I do?' cried Ellen, in a tone of ſelf-defence. 'What power on earth could have convinced Sir William of my innocence, had I returned to England with Henry? And would you have had me barter my reputation, and my only chance of happineſs, for an eſcape from hardſhips which I had already proved not to be inſupportable? But God only knows what it coſt me to make the choice I did!' 'The choice!' ſaid Mr. Mordaunt rapturouſly, 'the choice was like yourſelf. It was the reſult of the pureſt principle and the ſteadieſt reaſon. But this ſtory will kill us all. For God's ſake make haſte to arrive in England, or I too ſhall incur Mr. Thornton's cenſure; for my brain will hardly bear it.' 'Mr. Thornton,' ſaid mrs. Thornton, ſobbing, 'has little reaſon to reproach you. Look at him; did you ever ſee him ſo moved before?' 'Oh! who would not be moved,' ſaid Mr. Thornton, 'at ſuch a proof of the ſtrength of rectitude, and the power of reaſon? And yet, wonderful as it appears, it is
<pb n="240" facs="unknown:036127_0452_1008537143CAF280"/>
in the power of every one to whom God has given common underſtanding, and has not curſed with unnatural depravity, to act as uprightly and heroi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cally as Ellen has done. All the reſt is the reſult of cultivation, or ſelf diſcipline, and of a continued habit of referring all our actions to principle.' 'My ever dear preceptor,' ſaid Ellen, 'if I have been able to act rightly, I owe it to you, to my dear mrs. Thornton, to my father; but chiefly I will ſay to <hi>you,</hi> who, never ſparing of your praiſe when I deſerved commendation, gave it always with the ſame judgment you have now done; and by convincing me the path of virtue was practica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to all, made me aſhamed to repreſent it to myſelf as difficult.' Henry could not ſpeak: he ſat with his face reſted upon the arm of the ſofa, in a ſtate of emotion that ſhook his whole frame. He heard not mr. Thornton's moral. He gave no credit to the eaſy practicability of ſuch virtues as Ellen's. He thought her an angel, and that it was ſcarcely among her fellow angels that ſhe was to be equalled. Ellen haſtened to conclude a narrative, the circumſtances of which ſo deeply affected her auditors. She was happy to have the taſk over; and felt herſelf more capable of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure and reſt when it was done. She now learnt, what from the multiplicity of events each ſide had to communicate, had hitherto remained untold; that the unhappy Mr. Raymond had met the fate his vices provoked; and that inſtead of the ſafe retreat he had promiſed himſelf in Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland, the vengeance of an injured family had overtaken him in a few days from the time when Ellen had left him. Refuſing to ſubm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="241" facs="unknown:036127_0453_1008537448C646E0"/>
be made good, but which was conducted with ſo much violence and danger to his opponents, as had obliged them to attempt ſubduing him by means as deſperate as thoſe he had uſed in his de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence. In this ſtruggle he had received wounds which proved mortal in a few days. His death had put Mrs. Raymond in poſſeſſion of a ſmall jointure; and had ſecured to his daughters the few thouſand pounds which had been ſettled upon them. Ellen now revealed, that it was to Mr. Raymond that ſhe owed the ſeaſonable relief which ſhe had before mentioned; and expatiated on the earneſt deſire that he had ſhewn of being farther ſerviceable to her. To hear of ſuch praiſe-worthy diſpoſitions in a man whom ſhe had once loved, was very acceptable to Mrs. Raymond. But as ill uſage had long ago worn out her affection for him; his death had rather ſhocked than afflicted her: and in the preſent happier proſpects of her family, ſhe ſoon learnt to conſider it rather as a releaſe than a misfortune. Ellen's two other ſiſters joined the happy party at Groby Manor the next day; and moſt unfeignedly partook of the joy that reigned there. In a few days, Ellen recovered her uſual ſerenity of mind: and in a few weeks ſhe was perfectly reſtored to bloom and health.</p>

                     <p>AND now what avails it to prolong a narra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive, the concluſion of which is already antici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pated? Oppoſed by no one duty, ſupported by her own wiſhes, ſanctioned by the authority of a parent, can it be ſuppoſed that Henry's revived claim to the hand and heart of Ellen was diſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed? Yet did ſhe feel an unſpeakable reluctance to becoming his wife, until her reputation was as ſpotleſs as her life. Her return to exiſtence muſt of neceſſity be known; and with it muſt be known the ſuſpicions which had ſo long held her in ſeclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion from the world. The death of Sir William made her vindication difficult; ſince no one could be aſſured of her innocence, but thoſe who would naturally ſcreen her guilt. The moſt unequivocal teſtimony was that of the Bohemian nobleman, and to him it was reſolved to apply; Henry de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termining that if the matter could not be ſettled ſatisfactorily by letter, he would himſelf take a journey to Vienna. Mr. Mordaunt drew up a plain ſtatement of all the facts upon which he had reaſon to think Sir William had grounded Ellen's condemnation: lady Almeria's teſtimony on thoſe which had ſeemingly been ſuch unequivocal marks
<pb n="243" facs="unknown:036127_0455_1008537A3686F430"/>
of her guilt was added thereto: and the nobleman was entreated to declare, whether Sir William laid any thing more to her charge than this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planation obviated. The natural eloquence of a parent trembling for the reputation of his child, gave an energy to Mr. Mordaunt's entreaties and remonſtrances, which muſt have affected any heart not wholly callous. The heart of the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hemian was not of this nature. He had long en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained doubts of the guilt of a woman to whoſe excellencies Sir William's never-ceaſing regrets had done reluctant juſtice: and ſince her eſcape, he had received ſuch proofs from Mrs. Ulric of the purity of her mind and the goodneſs of her principles, as had well prepared him for the vin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dication of her conduct which he now received. The anſwer he returned was the moſt ſatisfactory poſſible.</p>
                     <p>He informed Mr. Mordaunt, that Sir William himſelf had frequently declared, in the laſt months of his life, that, were it poſſible, he could have been miſtaken in what his own ſenſes had wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed, he ſhould be perſuaded he had wronged the unfortunate Ellen; that remorſe for the ſeverity of the puniſhment he had inflicted, even ſuppoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her guilty, had haunted every hour of his life; that he ſeemed not unfrequently to regret the ſtrictneſs with which his orders, not to convey any letter or meſſage to him from her, had been obſerved; that nothing withheld him from again ſeeking her, but the inſupportable ſhame which muſt have overwhelmed him, either had ſhe been able to have cleared herſelf from the crimes im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted to her, or which would have attended his reſtoring her to the world, guilty or innocent; and that, finally, even the dread of this ſhame
<pb n="244" facs="unknown:036127_0456_1008537BD19DA0D8"/>
would probably have given way to the increaſing wretchedneſs of his mind, had his life been ſpared a little longer.</p>
                     <p>The Bohemian ſtated it as having been his own intention, after the death of his friend, to have viſited Ellen in her priſon, and from the opinion which he ſhould have been able to have formed of her from ſuch an interview, to have regulated his own future conduct, as to the continuation of her impriſonment, or the putting a ſpeedy and final end to it. He ingenuouſly confeſſed, that though, had he found her innocent, he ſhould have held his friend's reputation as nothing when compared with the injuſtice and cruelty of detain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her any longer a captive; yet, that had ſhe appeared to him guilty, he ſhould have preferred ſuffering her to languiſh out her life in perpetual confinement, to the fixing ſuch a ſtain upon Sir William's memory, as her reſtoration to the world and the publication of the whole ſtory muſt have done.</p>
                     <p>The generous Bohemian after congratulating the happy father on the innocence and eſcape of his daughter, informed him, that in order that no cloud might obſcure a happineſs ſo dearly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed and ſo amply deſerved, he had written a full vindication of her character, to the guardian of her child, and the truſtees of her ſettlement: and this he had done, he ſaid, not more from a conviction that by ſuch a teſtimony to her virtues he offered the moſt acceptable proof of his invio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lable attachment to his deceaſed friend, than from the aſſurance he had in his own mind, that he was offering a tribute to truth, and from the pleaſure which reſulted to himſelf, in an act of juſtice and compenſation.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="245" facs="unknown:036127_0457_10085381A3AE9908"/>In conſequence of this well-judged and generous interference of the amiable Bohemian, Ellen found no difficulty in having her daughter given to her wiſhes. By this agency ſhe was enabled alſo to acquit herſelf, as far as money could acquit her, of obligations to the good Mrs. Ulric and the faithful Thereſa; nor can it be ſuppoſed that the grandſon of old Deborah was forgotten. Henry, in the ample proviſion which his diſintereſted heart had apportioned to every branch of his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, had left himſelf poor: but he had more than ſufficient for happineſs. He revived the ſcheme which, ſo many years before, he had preſſed with ſo much fruitleſs earneſtneſs. Ellen and he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to content themſelves with her jointure, until his eſtate had cleared itſelf of every incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance: and, at the earneſt entreaty of Mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt, they took up their abode at Groby Manor. The cottage of old Deborah was enlarged, and fitted up for the reception of Mrs. Raymond and her daughters, that they might (while always moſt welcome to Groby Manor) have a place to retire to, when under the dominion of that wiſh which is felt at times by every human mind, the wiſh, that as we ſhut the door upon us we may be able to ſay, 'Now I am at home.' Of the happineſs of Henry and Ellen, of the feelings of Mr. Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>daunt, of the contentment of the Thorntons, and of the peace and ſatisfaction of all within the reach of their benevolence, it were needleſs to tell. To thoſe who have hearts and principles ſimilar to theirs all that could be ſaid would be ſuperfluous: to thoſe of oppoſite feelings and opinions it would be unintelligible.</p>
                     <p>Such then is the hiſtory of Ellen. Inſtructed

                     <p>"A vigorous and cultivated intellect eaſily accommo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dates itſelf to new occupations. The notion, that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividual genius can only excel in one thing, is a vulgar error. A mind endued by nature with ſtrong powers and quick ſenſibility, and by culture furniſhed in an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common degree with habits of attention and reflection, wherever it is placed, will find itſelf employments; and whatever it undertakes, will execute it well. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the repeated proofs, which the ingenious and juſtly admired writer of thoſe letters has given to the public, that her talents are far above the ordinary level, it will not be thought ſurpriſing, that ſhe ſhould excel in different kinds of writing; that the qualifications which have enabled her to inſtruct young people by moral leſſons and tales, and to furniſh the philoſopher with original and important ſpeculations, ſhould alſo em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>power her to entertain and intereſt the public, in a manner peculiarly her own, by writing a book of tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vels.</p>
                     <p>"We have no heſitation in aſſuring our readers, that Mrs. W. has done this in the preſent volume: her active mind has, throughout her tour, been awake to every object and occurrence. She has been at no loſs to find in every new ſituation ſomething intereſting to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribe, or ſome occaſion for juſt reflection. The letters
<pb facs="unknown:036127_0463_1008539357DAF2E8"/>
are evidently not the effect of elaborate ſtudy. But from a mind well ſtored, and exerciſed, as this writer's, the eaſy and unſolicited effuſions of the moment, in a work of this kind, are preferable to artificial arrange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. "In order to avoid becoming ſtiff and af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected, I determined" ſays Mrs. W. "to let my re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks and reflections flow unreſtrained, as I perceived that I could not give a juſt deſcription of what I ſaw, but by relating the effect different objects have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced on my mind and feelings whilſt the impreſſions were ſtill freſh." Her plan as ſtated by herſelf was ſimply to endeavour to give a juſt view of the preſent ſtate of the countries ſhe has paſſed through, as far as ſhe could obtain information during ſo ſhort a reſidence; avoiding thoſe details, which without being very uſeful to travellers, who follow the ſame route, appear very inſipid to thoſe who only accompany you in the chair."</p>

                     <p>"The tales, as a ſeries of moral leſſons, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent. They are of a nature ſufficiently ſuited to afford amuſement; and at the ſame time are happily adapted to fix upon the heart ſtrong impreſſions in fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of amiable and virtuous manners: they are not fetched out of the wilds of fancy, nor out of the clouds of abſtraction, but from the common walks of life: they inculcate no romantic or impracticable maxims of conduct, but the plain principles of uſeful morality: they abound with amuſing incidents, and are connected by a continued courſe of narration, which is both more agreeable in the peruſal, and, better remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rered, than a miſcellaneous collection of ſhort and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached ſtories: the ſtyle in which they are written is correct and eaſy; and the whole is enlivened by a great variety of prints, which are well executed, and which have this peculiar excellence, that almoſt every plate

is applied to the illuſtration of ſome moral ſentiment.

                     <p>"In the midſt of the numerous attempts which in the preſent age of ſpeculation and controverſy are made to enlighten the underſtanding, the cultivation of the heart is perhaps too much neglected. It is with pleaſure that we find our attention called to a work of which the principal objects appear to be, to impreſs the hearts of men with juſt ſentiments reſpecting hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man life and manners, and to conduct them, by the plaineſt and moſt direct path, to the true happineſs of rational beings. The writer is not one of thoſe extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant miſanthropes who would adviſe men to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>draw from ſociety, and from ſpleen and ſuperſtition lead the lives of monks and hermits.</p>
                     <p>"The work is enlivened with well choſen quotati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and entertaining anecdotes.—The preſent tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, which is from the French, contains only ſelect parts of the original German work, conſiſting of four large volumes in octavo. It is but juſtice to the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor to add, that this work has been generally admired in Germany, and that Mr. Z. in the year 1785, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived from the Empreſs of Ruſſia a valuable ring and a gold medal, accompanied with the following note: "To M.
