            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>Some Reaſons, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>CONSIDERING the different Opinions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the People of the Colony of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut,</hi> relative to the Conduct of the GO<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VERNOR in taking, and of the COUNCILLORS in adminiſtring the Oath enjoined by the Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, charging certain Stamp-Duties on the Colonies and Plantations in <hi>America,</hi> commonly called the Stamp-Act. And that ſuch differing Sentiments, occaſion Diſputes, Diſquietudes and Uneaſineſs among ſome of the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants.</p>
            <p>It may be expedient, and expected, that a brief Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Reaſons of that Conduct ſhould be publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, for the Information and Satisfaction of ſuch as are deſirous to be acquainted with the ſame.</p>
            <p>To the End therefore, that Truth may appear, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to that Matter; and that the Occaſions of Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:010297_0003_0F7E71FDE420D720"/>
concerning that Affair, may be removed. The fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Obſervations and Hints are offered to candid Conſideration.</p>
            <p>It is well known to the People of this Colony, who have printed Copies of the Stamp-Act in their Hands; that all the then preſent Governors or Commanders in Chief of any Britiſh Colony, were expreſsly required be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the firſt Day of November, 1765; and all who ſhall hereafter be made Governors or Commanders in Chief of the Colonies and Plantations, or any of them before their Entrance into their Governments, to take a ſolemn Oath, to do their utmoſt, that all, and every the Clauſes con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that Act, ſhould be punctually, and <hi>bona fide,</hi> obſerved according to the true Intent and Meaning thereof, ſo far as appertains unto the ſaid Governors or Commanders in Chief reſpectively, under the like Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalties, Forfeitures and Diſabilities, either for neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to take the ſaid Oath, or for wittingly neglecting to do their Duty accordingly, as are mentioned and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in An Act made in the 7th and 8th Year of the Reign of King WILLIAM the Third, entituled, "An Act for preventing Frauds, and regulating Abuſes in the Plantation Trade." And that the Perſons who have been, or ſhall be appointed to adminiſter the Oath required to be taken by the ſaid Act of King WILLIAM, are expreſſly required to adminiſter the Oath required by the Stamp Act.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:010297_0004_0F7E71FEA2769DD8"/>
The Act of WILLIAM the Third, to which the Stamp Act refers, requires the ſaid Governors or Commanders in Chief, to take the like Oath reſpecting the Clauſes in that Act; and alſo, reſpecting the Clauſes in An Act made in the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Year of CHARLES the Second; and in another Act made in the 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> Year of the ſame Reign: And that ſuch Oath ſhould be adminiſtred by ſuch Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons as His Majeſty, His Heirs or Succeſſors ſhould appoint; And by the aforeſaid Act of WILLIAM, it is further enacted, that upon Complaint and Proof, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore His Majeſty, His Heirs or Succeſſors, or ſuch as ſhould be by him or them thereunto authoriſed and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, by the Oath of two or more credible Witneſſes; that any of the ſaid Governors or Commanders in Chief, have neglected to take the ſaid Oath at the Times a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>foreſaid, or have been wittingly or willingly negllgent in doing their Duty accordingly. The ſaid Governor ſo neglecting or offending, ſhall be removed from his Government, and forfeit the Sum of One Thouſand Pounds Sterling.</p>
            <p>And although it doth not appear, that any Perſons were appointed in Conſequence of the Acts of the 12<hi rend="sup">th</hi> and 15<hi rend="sup">th</hi> of CHARLES the Second, to adminiſter the Oaths to the Governors, required to be taken by thoſe Acts (in both of which the Governors were required to be ſworn, much to the ſame Purpoſe, as in the Act of
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010297_0005_0F7E71FF252D3640"/>
WILLIAM is mentioned) yet in Purſuance of the Act of WILLIAM, the King appointed the Governor of the <hi>Maſſachuſetts,</hi> to adminiſter that Oath to the Governor of <hi>Connecticut;</hi> upon which the Colony repreſented to the King, the Hardſhips and Difficulties of ſuch a Meaſure, which obliged the Governor to go to <hi>Boſton</hi> to be qualified, before he could act in his Office with Safety. Upon which the King was graciouſly pleaſed by His Commiſſion to a certain Number of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil by Name, &amp;c. Which he calls his Council for the Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> to appoint them, or any Three or more of them to adminiſter the Oath to the Governor; and that Commiſſion ſtands now directed to, and appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any Three or more of the Council of the Colony, for the Time being, to adminiſter that Oath to the Governor; (none elſe therefore, may do it) and theſe Perſons, the Stamp Act expreſsly required to adminiſter the Oath, required by that Act, to be taken by the Governor.</p>
            <p>By Virtue of that Commiſſion under the Great Seal, lodged in the Secretary's Office, that Oath hath been adminiſtred to the ſucceſſive Governors of the Colony ever ſince; which is near Seventy Years.</p>
            <p>Theſe being the principal Facts, it may from thence be juſtly obſerved,</p>
            <p>Firſt. That as the Commiſſion of King WILLIAM, to the Council of the Colony, was obtained on the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010297_0006_0F7E71FFEEB1F6D8"/>
queſt of the Colony; there can be no Doubt, but the Colony eſteemed it a great Favour, and thankfully ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepted it. And that ſuch Requeſt and Acceptance muſt imply on the Colony's Part, an Agreement to comform to it; and alſo, that the Council whom the People ſhould elect for the King ſhould act under and according to it. And this every Councillor by the Acceptance of his Office engages to do: And as it is a Maxim of Law in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Conſtitution, That the King hath an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt in, and a Right to the Service of all his Subjects; and more eſpecially to the Service of Thoſe who are the Officers of the Crown; and by that Means are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der particular and expreſs Obligations to Obedience.</p>
            <p>Every Governor and Councillor are bound, not only by their Allegience, but by their Office, and in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Caſe alſo, by Agreement or Contract, by accepting their Offices to which the aforeſaid Commiſſion is an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexed, to yield Obedience to the Requirements of the King and Parliament.</p>
            <p>It is taken for granted by the King and Parliament, That all his Majeſty's Officers will obey their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. And on this Preſumption, the Execution of Royal Commands, Acts of Parliament, and even Acts of Provincial Legiſlatures are often made dependant. The King therefore, in every ſuch Caſe, expects all his Officers, as well thoſe which the People elect<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:010297_0007_0F7E7200BA104DB8"/>
diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ignate for him, as thoſe whom he, by his immediate Commiſſion or Warrant appoints, will obey his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands.</p>
            <p>In Caſe any Officers, who are immediately appointed by the Crown, refuſe Obedience; it is natural to ſuppoſe they will be diſplaced, and others more loyal and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent put in their Room. But the Government to which they belong, or for which they are appointed will be in no Danger of a Cenſure in that Caſe. It muſt nevertheleſs, be ſuppoſed, the Conſequence would be very different, if thoſe Officers whom the People elect, ſhould refuſe ſuch Obedience, and ſo fruſtrate the Intention and Requirements of the Act, in any particular; for, in ſuch a Caſe, it may juſtly be expected, the King will at leaſt appoint others, and that in another Government, in whom he can confide, and not continue the Honor of a Betruſtment to ſuch, for the Time being, as the People ſhould deſignate, on whom he can have no Dependence. Yea, it is to be preſumed, that if the Governor and Council, whom the People chooſe, ſhould refuſe Obedience, the King, or the King and Parliament would deprive the People of the Privilege of electing ſuch Officers; and then the whole Charter would be at once ſtruck up. That this would be the Event, in ſuch Caſe, muſt be more than probable.</p>
            <p>The Governor and the Councillors, apprehending their
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010297_0008_0F7E7201CCC7A6F8"/>
Non-Compliance with the Stamp-Act, in the Particular aforeſaid, would be fatal to the Charter Privileges grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the good People of this Colony (for which they have the tendereſt Regard, and higheſt Value) held themſelves bound to conduct ſo as not to endanger, but rather, if poſſible, to ſave them to themſelves, and the People, for whoſe Welfare they were ſeriouſly concerned.<note n="*" place="bottom">'Tis not amiſs to obſerve here, that many entertain very miſtaken Apprehenſions concerning the Part the Governor is bound to act by Virtue of the Oath he hath taken; they ſuppoſe he is obliged to exert his power, as Governor, to enforce ſaid Act upon the People, either by taking upon himſelf the Office of Stamp-Diſtributor, or appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſome other to that Office, or the like. When in Truth no ſuch Thing is expected or required—the Oath now taken, is not different from that which all the ſucceſſive Governors have taken ever ſince the Act of Trade took Place; but that never made them Judges of Admiralty, Surveyors of the Woods, &amp;c. or empowered them to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>point any. All that any former Governors were obliged to do, with Relation to the Act of Trade, or that the preſent Governors have to do with Regard to the Stamp-Act, is only to afford due Protection to the King's Officers; and, on proper Information, to prevent and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh Frauds and Impoſitions. The Governor ſwears, <q>That he will do his utmoſt, that all, and every the Clauſes contained in ſaid Act, be punctually and <hi>Bona fide</hi> obſerved, according to the true Intent and Meaning thereof, ſo far as appertains to him, as Governor.</q> But here a Queſtion naturally ariſes, What additional Duty is incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bent on the Governor, in Conſequence of his having taken this Oath? Indeed, little or nothing more than was his Duty before, and to which he was bound, by his Office-Oath, and the Rules of the Common Law. And the Oath required the Stamp-Act, is only to be conſidered as a further Security on the Governor, to diſcharge that which he was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore bound to perform.</note>
            </p>
            <p>Beſides all this, it is natural to ſuppoſe both the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and Councillors, by a Refuſal, would have expoſed
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010297_0009_0F7E72023A5E98B0"/>
themſelves to the King's higheſt Diſpleaſure; and what that means many have been made ſenſible of by fatal Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience. There can be no Objections againſt ſuch a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the expreſs Requirements of the Stamp-Act, unleſs they ariſe from the Force of ſome ſuperior Law, or from the Force of ſome prior Oath which ſuch Officers are under: To this it will readily be conceded, that Oath ought not to be againſt Oath, nor ought a ſuperior Law to be diſobeyed by a Compliance with one ſubordinate to it; but if neither of theſe happen in the preſent Caſe, the Objection vaniſhes: And if on the Contrary, former Oaths, and a ſuperior Law alſo, oblige to this Conduct, the Objection will appear yet more Groundleſs. That this is truly the Caſe, will appear, if it be conſidered,</p>
            <p>Secondly, That the Governor and Council were, by their Office-Oath, bound to ſuch a Conformity to the Act.—It is well known to every one who hath inſpected the Governor's and Aſſiſtant's Oaths, in the Colony-Law-Book, that they are ſworn to maintain all the lawful Privileges of the Colony, &amp;c. By which they are bound to do their utmoſt for that Purpoſe: And the ſame Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation lies upon them, not to neglect or refuſe doing that, the Omiſſion of which would endanger the Loſs of thoſe Privileges. This muſt appear plain to every candid Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010297_0010_0F7E72031D110A40"/>
If therefore, the Governor and Council, whom the People chooſe, by their refuſing Obedience to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands of an Act of Parliament, would endanger the Loſs of the Privileges which they, and their Electors en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy, as has been ſhewn to be the Caſe; it neceſſarily fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, they are bound by their ſaid Oaths, not to refuſe ſuch Obedience; and alſo, that while they view Matters in this Light their Diſobedience, or Non-Compliance, could not, in their Opinion, come ſhort of a Breach of their Office-Oaths. This ſhews the greateſt Injuſtice, of being charged with Perjury, on Account of a Fulfilment of thoſe ſacred Obligations comprehended in the Office-Oaths aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>Let it be conſidered, Thirdly, That the Governor, by a refuſal to take the Oath, by the Time preſcribed in the Act, would have expoſed himſelf, beſides what has been before mentioned, to the Penalty of being removed from his Government, and the Forfeiture of One Thouſand Pounds Sterling. And as his Tryal muſt be before the King, or ſuch Perſons as he ſhould appoint, there could be no avoiding a Condemnation, it would be to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, unleſs to aggrevate the Offence, to plead any Thing againſt the Operation of the Act, before thoſe Judges.—A Judgment, in ſuch a Caſe, would not only ſubject the Governor to the Payment of a large Fine, too heavy for
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010297_0011_0F7E72039DEB7068"/>
a Governor of this Colony to bear; and to a Removal from his Office, but would alſo render him Infamous, and deprive him of any further Uſefulneſs in Life: And how that would feel, let any Man, who has any Value for his Character and Reputation, make it his own Caſe, and thereon candidly judge for himſelf, and in ſo doing, he will judge for another.</p>
            <p>It hath been objected, That although the Governor is ſubject, by the Act of Parliament, to a very ſevere Penalty in Caſe of his Neglect or Refuſal to take the Oath, yet no Penalty is impoſed on the Council, in Caſe they neglect or refuſe to adminiſter the ſame:—And though it might be wiſe and prudent, for the Governor to offer to take the Oath, and in a Senſe neceſſary for him ſo to do; yet ſurely the Council were under no ſuch Obligation or Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity to adminiſter the ſame:—And that, whatever might be ſaid, by Way of Excuſe, on Account of the Governor, nothing can be ſaid, in Favour of the Councillors, who undertook to adminiſter the ſame, as their Neglect or Refuſal expoſed them to no Penalty at all.—</p>
            <p>To this it may be anſwered, That, although no parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Penalty is expreſsly mentioned, in ſaid Statute, to be inflicted on the Council, in caſe they ſhould refuſe or ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glect
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:010297_0012_0F7E72056C298EA8"/>
to adminiſter the Oath required; yet, as the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion expreſsly empowers and directs them to adminiſter the ſame, their Neglect, or Diſobedience would have been a great Breach of Truſt, and ſuch a high Contempt of the Authority both of the King and Parliament, as would be puniſhable even at Common Law. Is it not a known Rule of the Law, in all ſuch Caſes, where no particular Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nalty is expreſsly mentioned, that the Offender lies at the King's Mercy, and may be puniſhed at Diſcretion (ſaving Life) either by the Courts of Common Law, or the Court of Chauncery? And 'tis apprehended, that the leaſt ſuch Councillors could expect, would be to ſuffer the ſame Pains and Penalties that the Governor would have incurred, had he been the faulty Party, and refuſed to take the Oath. Let the impartial World candidly conſider this, and ſay, Is it reaſonable the Councillors ſhould expoſe themſelves to ſuch a Sentence as this? If, as the Objection ſuppoſes, the Penalty is too great for a Governor of this Colony bear, ſurely, with more Reaſon it may be ſaid, that 'tis much too heavy for any Councillors to endure!</p>
            <p>This Matter, and the Conſequences, as they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpected the Governor, appeared ſo clear to the Council, when diſcourſed among themſelves, that the whole Council preſent, were of Opinion, it was adviſeable for the Governor to offer to take the Oath required:
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:010297_0013_0F7E7205E2581570"/>
They alſo ſee, that if one Governor was removed for Refuſal, another would be in the ſame Caſe, and ſo on. Therefore the Colony muſt, in that Caſe, give up all Pretence of having a Governor or Commander in Chief, unleſs he complied with the Act. And whether the Charter itſelf could ſubſiſt, without ſuch an Officer, is no difficult Queſtion to determine. If, therefore, it was the Governor's Duty to offer to take the Oath, it muſt certainly be right for him to take it, in Caſe the Council would adminiſter it: And that they were bound to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter it, has been clearly evinced: So that the Whole of their Conduct, in the Matter aforeſaid, appears not only to be barely juſtified; but alſo, that it deſerves the Applauſe of all who deſire the Safety of the Privileges of the Colony. Whoever candidly conſider theſe Things, will, as it is conceived, judge the Governor and Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cillors, by their aforeſaid Conduct, acted the Part of faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Officers to the Crown, and that of true Patriots to their Country. Upon the Whole then, it may be juſtly concluded, they were moved from Principles of Loyalty to the King; from a ſerious and tender Concern for the Privileges of the Colony; a conſcientious Regard to the ſolemn Obligations of their Office-Oaths; and a juſt Value for their own Intereſt, Reputation, and Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in Life.</p>
