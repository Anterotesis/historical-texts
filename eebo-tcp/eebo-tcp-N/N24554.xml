            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

After they had ſaluted each other, young Manlius deſired a private conference; and as ſoon as he ſaw himſelf alone with the tribune, he drew out his dagger, preſented it to his breaſt, and declared he would ſtab him that moment, if he did not ſwear in the form he ſhould dictate, "Never to hold the aſſembly of the people for accuſing his father." Pompon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ius, who ſaw the dagger glittering at his breaſt, himſelf alone without arms, and attacked by a robuſt young man, full of a bold confidence in his own ſtrength, took the oath demanded of him, and afterwards confeſſed, with a kind of complacency in the thing, and a ſincerity which ſufficiently argued he was not ſorry for what he had done, that it was that violence which obliged him to deſiſt from his enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize.</p>

maſter having occaſion to diſmount on the road, the ſervant watching his opportunity, took a piſtol from his maſter's ſaddle, and ſhot him dead on the ſpot: then rifled him of his jewels and money, and hanging a large ſtone to his neck, he threw him into the neareſt ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal. With this booty he made off to a diſtant part of the country, where he had reaſon to believe that neither he nor his maſter were known. There he began to trade in a very low way at firſt, that his obſcurity might ſcreen him from obſervation, and in the courſe of a good many years, ſeemed to riſe by the natural pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of buſineſs, into wealth and conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; ſo that his good fortune appeared at once the effect and reward of induſtry and vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue. Of theſe he counterfeited the appearance ſo well, that he grew into great credit, marri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a good family, and by laying out his ſudden ſtores diſcreetly, as he ſaw occaſion, and joining to all an univerſal affability, he was admited to a ſhare of the government of the town, and roſe from one poſt to anoth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er till at length he was choſen chief magiſtrate. In this office he maintained a fair character, and continued to fill it with no ſmall applauſe, both as governor and a judge; till one day as he ſat on the bench with ſome of his brethren, a criminal was brought before him, who was accuſed of murdering his maſter. The evidence came out full, the jury brought in their ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dict that the priſoner was guilty, and the whole

In Queen Anne's wars, he was an enſign in the Engliſh army then in Spain: but he was ſo abſolutely poſſeſſed by this evil, that all duty, and every thing elſe that prevented his gratify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his darling paſſion, was to him moſt griev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous: he ſcarcely allowed himſelf time for reſt; or if he ſlept, his dreams preſented packs of cards to his eyes, and the rattling of dice to his ears:—his meals were neglected, or if he at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended them, he looked upon that as ſo much loſt time; ſwollowed his meat with precipit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and hurried to the dear gaming-table a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain. In one word; he was a profeſſed game<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter. For ſome time, fortune was his friend: and he was ſo ſucceſsful, that he has often ſpread his winnings on the ground, and roll<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf on them, in order that it might be ſaid of him, "he wallowed in gold." Such was his life for a conſiderable time; but as he <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ath often ſaid, and I dare ſay every conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate man will join with him, "it was the moſt miſerable part of it."—After ſome time he was ordered on the recruiting duty, and at Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>celona
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:032500_0008_0FF2FAE0E77D3508"/>
he raiſed one hundred and fifty recruits for the regiment; though this was left entirely to his ſerjeant, that he might be more at leiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure to attend to his darling paſſion. After ſome changes of good and ill-luck, fortune declared ſo openly againſt him, that in one unlucky run, he was totally ſtript of the laſt farthing. In this diſtreſs he applied to a cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of the ſame regiment with himſelf, for a loan of ten guineas; which was refuſed with this ſpeech, "What! lend my money to a profeſſed gameſter! No, Sir, I muſt be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſed: for of neceſſity I muſt loſe either my money or my friend; I therefore chooſe to keep my money." With this taunting refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al he retired to his lodging, where he threw himſelf on the bed, to lay himſelf and his ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rows to a momentary reſt, during the heat of the day. A bug, gnat, or ſome ſuch vermin, happening to bite him, he awoke; when his melancholy ſituation immediately preſented itſelf to him. Without money! and no proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect how to get any to ſubſiſt himſelf and his recruits to the regiment, then at a great diſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance from him? and ſhould they deſert for want of pay, he muſt be anſwerable for it;—and he could expect nothing but caſhiering for diſappointing the queen's ſervice. He had no friend, for he whom he had eſteemed ſo had not only refuſed to lend him money, but had added taunts to his refuſal. He had no ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance there! and ſtrangers he knew
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:032500_0009_0FF2FAE330CAD458"/>
would not let him have ſo large a ſum as was anſwerable to his real neceſſity. This natur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally led him to reflect ſeriouſly on what had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced him to commence gameſter, and this he preſently perceived was idleneſs. He had now found the cauſe, but the cure was ſtill wanting: how was that to be effected ſo as to prevent a relapſe? Something muſt be done, ſome method muſt be purſued ſo effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ually to employ his time, as to prevent his having any to throw away at gaming. It then occurred to him, that the adjatancy of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giment was to be diſpoſed of, and this he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termined to purchaſe, as a poſt the moſt likely to find him a ſufficient and laudable way of paſſing his time. He had letter of credit to draw for what ſum he pleaſed for his promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the army; but not to throw away idly, or to encourage his extravagancy. This was well: but the main difficulty remained, and he muſt get to the regiment before he could take any ſteps towards the intended purchaſe, or draw for the ſum to make it with.

               <head>VICE AND VIRTUE.</head>
               <p>AMONG the dancers of the palace in the reign of Abbas the great, king of Perſia, there was a young maid named Idris, whom the maſter of the revels, on the report of her charms, had ſent for from Caſbin to Iſpahan. Her mother being of the ſame profeſſion, ſhe had followed the fame way of life: but as ſhe honorably diſtinguiſhed herſelf from her fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male companions, ſhe demonſtrated that vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue is practicable in every ſituation of life, however ſlippery or dangerous it may be.</p>
               <p>Scarcely had Idris appeared on the theatre of the capital, but ſhe found herſelf beſet by the grandees, who ſtrove to pleaſe her by the ſame means that had won others in that ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. One exhauſted all his rhetoric in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mending her ſhape and manner. Another extolled the form of her face, her complex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion, and the regularity of her features. A third, to give weight to the encomiums he had beſtowed on her voice, repeated an air he had heard her ſing, and declared his diſtrac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to arrive at that grace with which ſhe gave life to the words. A fourth, boaſting his preciſion and ſkill in dancing, exhibited inſtantly ſome of the attitudes he had learned of her. A firſt-rate Sir Fopling gave her a liſt of the pretty women he had deſerted from the moment he firſt ſaw her. A young man, by birth entitled to become a Mollah, ſilently diſplayed his figure and his dreſs. An old

                  </gap>r of the public money dazzled her eyes with a diamond of the firſt water, and offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it, beſides the perquiſites of the contracts, which it was his cuſtom to beſtow upon his miſtreſs. An officer of the crown made a pompous deſcription of the preſents with which he had recompenſed the friendſhip of the little Zaki. In fine, every one exerted his faculties and his addreſs in order to gain the preference over his rivals.</p>
               <p>But Idris was not to be caught by ſuch baits. At the palace, at aſſemblies, in the public walks, and in all places, the diſcourſe turned upon the new dancer. Every one talked of her beauty, her wit, and her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaging behaviour, and, which was more than they had ſaid of any other of her profeſſion, they agreed in acknowledging her to be very virtuous. It is the property of none but the moſt exalted virtue to gain the reſpect and admiration of young courtiers. Mahmut con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived a high opinion of Idris's virtue, from the extraordinary effect it produced.</p>
               <p>Mahmut bore among the lords of the court the ſame character which Idris maintained among the dancers of her ſex: proof againſt the defects of his equals, and the vices of his ſtation. As ſoon as he began to appear in the world, he became ſenſible of the ridicu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſneſs of that noiſy, obſtreperous giddineſs, which moſt young people of quality affect; and being happily, prejudiced againſt the idle

                  </gap>ad, he took care not to follow their example, yet without ſeeming to condemn them. While their days were divid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed between the toilet, the table, viſits, and gaming, he ſpent the morning in his cloſet a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong his books, or thoſe whoſe converſation could inſtruct him better. In the afternoon he frequented the manufactories and working places about the palace; talked with the ableſt hands in the ſeveral arts; and obſerved, with the utmoſt attention, how they proceeded in their works. In the evening he was at ſome or other of the public entertainments, which he enjoyed with a moderation that is ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable from taſte and diſcernment. After which he repaired to ſome of the moſt brilliant aſſemblies of Iſpahan, as well to avoid a ſingu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity that would have rendered him odious, as to acquire a greater ſhare of the complai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance and politeneſs which reigned in them.—Mahmut's wit, and the uſe he made of it, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered him ſuperior to thoſe who were his e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quals in birth; and beſides the advantage of a good figure and graceful air, he diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed himſelf no leſs among them by his natural and acquired talents. Idris could not behold this amiable Perſian without emotion: ſhe ſhunned all her importunate ſuitors, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placency fancying him free from all their faults, ſhe ſecretly wiſhed that the beauty which they had ſo highly extolled might make an impreſſion on him.

               <p>"Doubtleſs you give the name of love." ſaid ſhe, with a charming ſmile, "to that which is only an effect of your taſte for novel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; I will not my lord, go farther at preſent on this head; it is your buſineſs to fix my judgment. I will ingenuouſly confeſs, though it will give you ſome unfavourable opinion of me, if you are not the man I take you to be, that I am not diſpleaſed at your liking me.—But if ever I ſee occaſion to alter the idea I have conceived of you, hope not that I ſhall in the leaſt indulge my inclination. I ſhall not take it ill if you give your heart to a woman more virtuous than I, therefore do not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain of your lot if I diſpoſe of mine in favour of any man whom I may find ſuperior to you in virtue."</p>
               <p>Mahmut ſtruck with admiration, and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flowing with joy, loboured to riſe to ſuch a pitch as might oblige Idris to be conſtant to him. He applied himſelf with freſh vigour to acquire the arts and ſciences neceſſary for a man in his ſtation. He made it his buſineſs to relieve indigent merit and unfortunate virtue. His humanity, generoſity, capacity and modeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, were equally conſpicuous; and Idris abun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dantly rewarded him for all the pains he took to pleaſe her. Praiſe, grounded on truth,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:032500_0015_0FF2FAF56D4F7108"/>
and coming from the mouth of ſo charming a perſon, filled the tender Mahmut's heart with joy and ſatisfaction. He read in the eyes of his beauteous miſtreſs how dear he was to her: he talked of his paſſion, and deſcribed its vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence. Idris liſtened to him with pleaſure, vowed ſhe would make him a juſt return, and thus animated him to give her no occaſion to repent her engagement. In the overflowings of their hearts, which none but true lovers can know and feel all the ſweetneſs of, they laid open to each other the moſt ſecret receſſes of their ſouls. Mahmut was grieved when he took leave of Idris, nor could ſhe bear his ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence without a viſible concern. They always parted under the greateſt impatience to meet again.</p>
               <p>Between two neighbours ſo powerful as the Grand Signior and the king of Perſia, there can be no long peace: a war ſoon broke out, and Mahmut was obliged to ſet out for the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my. He waited upon Idris, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

The fortitude of the fair one daunted him; he was afraid of leſſening himſelf in her eſteem, by diſcovering any weakneſs. Idris perceived the conflict in his breaſt, and loved him for it more intenſely.</p>
               <p>Mahmut had not been gone a month when he gave way to his deſire of an interview with Idris. He ſlipped away privately from the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my,
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:032500_0016_0FF2FAF7EF675488"/>
and with the help of relays, which he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided on the road, he was at the gates of Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pahan before they miſed him in the camp.—Alighting at the houſe of one of his old ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants he diſguiſed himſelf in the apparel of a peaſant, that he might not be known in the city; and, impatient of an interview with his Idris, he flew to her houſe.</p>
               <p>The charming maid was ſitting at her bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cony, as Mahmut was advancing, and knew him, notwithſtanding his diſguiſe. Grieved to ſee him thus neglect his glory and his duty, ſhe ran directly to her cloſet, charged her ſlave to admit no viſitor whatever. She melted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to tears at the weakneſs of her lover; but ſoon recovered herſelf, and wrote him the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing billet:</p>
               <floatingText type="letter">
                  <body>
                     <head>Idris to the peaſant.</head>
                     <p>"Friend, I know thou art to be forthwith at the army. Call upon Mahmut, and tell him from me that I deſire him to remember the conditions on which the heart of Idris is to be ſecured."</p>
                  </body>
               </floatingText>
               <p>Mahmut was too much confounded with theſe words to aſk any queſtions of the ſlave that delivered him the billet. He went back to his domeſtic's houſe, to put off his diſguiſe; and fluctuating between admiration, grief, and fear, he repaired again to the army with as much haſte as he had travelled up to Iſpahan. His chief ſtudy being to make amends for the fault he had committed, he behaved the reſt of
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:032500_0017_0FF2FAF9871E28A8"/>
the campaign with ſo much ardour, bravery, and conduct, that he was deſervedly promoted to a higher poſt, which the king conferred on him, with the moſt honorable eulogies, at the head of the army. Idris wrote him a congat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ulatory letter on his promotion, in which with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mentioning his weakneſs, ſhe gave him to underſtand that ſhe had forgiven him.</p>
               <p>Mahmut, tranſported with joy, haſtened back to Iſpahan, as ſoon as the army was or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered into winter-quarters, and liſtened to no other conſiderations but his eſteem for the virtuous girl: he entreated her to complete his happineſs in becoming his wife. "Your wife, my lord!" cried Idris, with an emotion that at once diſcovered the tendereſt paſſion and concern for the glory of her lover;—"what! would Mahmut forget himſelf ſo far? In diſpoſing of your heart you may indeed conſult nothing but your inclinations; but when the queſtion is to chooſe a partner in your dignity and fortune, you hold both. I have the deepeſt ſenſe of gratitude for this ſignal teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of your eſteem; but what will your re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations ſay? What will all Perſia ſay, whoſe eyes are, upon you, and who ſee nothing in me but the mean profeſſion I was bred to? No, Mah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mut, it muſt not be; I ſee my error, I am aſhamed of my weakneſs; I that am ready to ſacrifice my life were it neceſſary to preſerve your glory, cannot be inſtrumental myſelf in ſullying it."</p>

                  <pb n="18" facs="unknown:032500_0018_0FF2FAFE0C7842C0"/>
Sentiments like theſe made the paſſionate Mahmut only more preſſing. "What are thoſe things," ſaid he, "which create ſo great a diſparity between us? An inſtant may de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prive me of them; but the dowry which you will bring me charming Idris, is a bleſſing that depends not on <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap> theſe words his countenance began to be clouded with grief; freſh denials drove him to deſpair; he drew his poniard, and was go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to plunge it into his breaſt. The tender Idris could hold out no longer. "Ah! Mah<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mut," cried ſhe, "ſtop your hand and live; to-morrow I ſhall be yours, grant me this ſhort reſpite." She could utter no more, tears put an end to her ſurpriſe, and ſtopt her breath.</p>
               <p>The news of their marriage ſoon took wind, and thoſe who envied him the poſſeſſion of ſo much beauty, abuſed him for his meanneſs; while the ſober and thinking part of the world extolled her virtues, and only lamented that her birth and fortune had not rendered them more conſpicuous and attracting. She was preſented to the king, who was charmed with her perſon, and finding her heart and her ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents would not diſgrace the higheſt quality, conferred a title and place at court.</p>

               <p>LUCRETIA was a lady of great beauty and noble extraction: ſhe married Collatinus,

Nothing can better decide our diſpute than the ſtate we ſhall find them in at a time when, moſt certainly they will not ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect us." They were a little warmed with wine. "Come on, let us go," they all cried together. They quickly galloped to Rome, which was about twenty miles from Ardea, where they find the princeſſes, wives of the young Tarquins, ſurrounded with company, and every circumſtance of the higheſt mirth and pleaſure. From thence they ride to Col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lata, where they ſaw Lucretia in a very different ſituation. With her maids about her, ſhe was at work in the inner part of her houſe, talking on the dangers to which her huſband was expoſed. The victory was ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged to her unanimouſly. She received her gueſts with all poſſible politeneſs and civility<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Lueretia's virtue, which ſhould have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded reſpect, was the very thing which kindled in the breaſt of Sextus Tarquin a ſtrong and deteſtable paſſion. Within a few days he returned to Collatia, and upon the plauſible excuſe he made for his viſit, he was received with all the politeneſs due to a near relation, and the eldeſt ſon of a king. Watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the fitteſt opportunity, he declares the paſſion ſhe had excited at his laſt viſit and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed the moſt tender intreaties, and all the artifices poſſible to touch a woman's heart; but all to no purpoſe. He then endeavoured to extort her compliance by the moſt terrible threatnings. It was in vain. She ſtill perſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in her reſolution; nor could ſhe be moved, even by the fear of death. But, when the monſter told her, that he would firſt diſpatch her, and then having murdered a ſlave, would lay him by her ſide, after which he would ſpread a report, that having caught them in the act of adultery, he had puniſhed them as they deſerved; this ſeemed to ſhake her reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution. She heſitated, not knowing which of theſe dreadful alternatives to take, whether, by conſenting to diſhonor the bed of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, whom ſhe tenderly loved; or, by refuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, to die under the odious character of hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing proſtituted her perſon to the luſt of a ſlave. He ſaw the ſtruggle of her ſoul; and ſeizing the unluckly moment, obtained an inglorious conqueſt. Thus Lucretia's virtue, which had
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:032500_0021_0FF2FB03D596BBC0"/>
been proof againſt the fear of death, could not hold out againſt the fear of infamy. The young prince, having gratified his paſſion, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned home as in triumph.</p>
               <p>On the morrow, Lucretia, overwhelmed with grief and deſpair, ſent early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to deſire her father, and her huſband to come to her, and bring with them each a truſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty friend, aſſuring them there was no time to loſe. They came with all ſpead, the one ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with Valerius, (ſo famous after under the name of Publicola) and the other with Brutus. The moment ſhe ſaw them come, ſhe could not command her tears; and when her huſband aſked her if all was well: "By no means," ſaid ſhe, "it cannot be well with a woman after ſhe has loſt her honor. Yes, Collatinus, thy bed has been defiled by a ſtran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger: but my body only is polluted; my mind is innocent, as my death ſhall witneſs.

All promiſed to revenge: and, at the ſame time, tried to comfort her with rep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſenting, "That the mind only ſins, not the body; and where the conſent is wanting there can be no guilt." "What Sextus deſerves," replies Lucretia, "I leave you to judge; but for me, though I declare myſelf innocent of

The Roman praetor deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her up to the triumvir, who cauſed <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>r to be carried to the priſon, in order to her being put to death. The goaler, who was ordered to execute her, was ſtruck with compaſſion,
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:032500_0024_0FF2FACA6515D5E0"/>
and could not reſolve to kill her. He choſe therefore to let her die of hunger. Beſides which he ſuffered her daughter to ſee her in priſon; taking care, however, that ſhe bro't her nothing to eat. As this continued many days, he was ſurpriſed that the priſoner lived ſo long without eating; and ſuſpected the daughter, upon watching her, he diſcovered that ſhe nouriſhed her mother with her own milk. Amazed at ſo pious, and at the ſame time ſo ingenious an invention, he told the fact to the triumvir, and the triumvir to the praetor, who believed the thing merited relat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the aſſembly of the people. The criminal was pardoned; a decree was paſſed that the mother and daughter ſhould be ſubſiſted for the reſt of their lives, at the expence of the public, and that a temple ſacred to piety ſhould be erected near the priſon.</p>

               <p>EUGENIO is juſt out of his minority, and in the twenty-ſecond year of his age; he prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſes the man with all that virtue and decency that makes his father's acquaintance covet his company; and indeed they may learn by his diſcourſe the art of good reaſoning, as well as the precepts of religion from his example.—He is an entertaining companion to the gay young gentlemen his equals; and yet divines and philoſophers take a pleaſure to have Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>genio amongſt them. He is careſſed by his
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:032500_0025_0FF2FB106C428930"/>
ſuperiors in honor and years; and though he is releaſed from the diſcipline of parently edu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, yet he treats the lady his mother with all the affectionate duty that could be deſired or demanded of him ten years ago; his father is content to ſee his own youth outſhone by his ſon, and confeſſes that Engenio already promiſes greater things than Agathus did at thirty.</p>
               <p>If you aſk whence theſe happy qualities a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſe, I grant there was ſome foundations for them in his very nature, there was ſomething of a complexional virtue mingled with his frame; but it is much more owing to the wiſe conduct of his parents from his very infancy, and the bleſſings of Divine Grace attending their labours, their prayers, and their hopes.</p>
               <p>He was trained up from the very cradle to all the duties of infant virtue, by the allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of love and reward, ſuited to his age; and never was driven to practice any thing by a frown or a haſty word, where it was poſſible for kinder affections to work the ſame effect by indulgence and delay.</p>
               <p>As faſt as his reaſoning powers began to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear and exert themſelves, they were conduct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in an eaſy track of thought, to find out and obſerve the reaſonableneſs of every part of his duty, and the lovely character of a child obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient to reaſon and to his parents will; while every departure from duty was ſhewn to be ſo contrary to reaſon, as laid an early foundation
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:032500_0026_0FF2FB13EAAD4B00"/>
for conſcience to work upon: conſcience be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan here to aſſume its office, and to manifeſt its authority in dictates, and reproofs, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections of mind peaceful, or painful, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his behaviour. When his parents ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved this inward monitor to awake in his ſoul, they could better truſt him out of their fight.</p>
               <p>When he became capable of conceiving of an Almighty and inviſible Being, who made this world and every creature in it, he was taught to pay all due regard to God his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker; and from the outhority and love of his father on earth, he was led to form right ideas (as far as childhood permitted) of the power, government, and goodneſs of the univerſal and ſupreme father of all in heaven.</p>
               <p>He was informed why puniſhment was due to an offence againſt God or his parents, that his fear might become an uſeful paſſion to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken and guard his virtue; but he was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructed, at the ſame time, that where he hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tily repented of a fault, and returned to his duty with new diligence, there was forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to be obtained both of God and man.</p>
               <p>When at any time a friend interceded for him to his father, after he had been guilty of a fault, he was hereby directed into the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of Jeſus the mediator between God and man <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>and thus he knew him as an interceſſor, before he could well underſtand the notion of his ſacrifice and atonement.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="27" facs="unknown:032500_0027_0FF2FB16815391B0"/>
In his younger years he paſſed but twice under the correction of the rod; once for a fit of obſtinacy and perſiſting in a falſehood; then he was given up to ſevere chaſtiſement, and it diſpelled and cured the ſullen humour forever; and once for the contempt of his mother's authority he endured the ſcourge again, and he wanted it no more.</p>
               <p>He was enticed ſometimes to the love of let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, by making his leſſon a reward of ſome domeſtic duty; and a permiſſion to purſue ſome parts of learning was the appointed re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compence of his diligence and improvement in others.</p>
               <p>There was nothing required of his memory but what was firſt (as far as poſſible) let into his underſtanding; and by proper images and repreſentations, ſuited to his years, he was taught to form ſome conception to things deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribed, before he was bid to learn the words by heart. Thus he was freed from the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of treaſuring up the cant and jargon of mere names, inſtead of the riches of ſolid knowledge.</p>
               <p>Where any abſtruſe and difficult notions oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred in his courſe of learning, his precep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor poſtponed them till he had gone through that ſubject in a more ſuperficial way; for this purpoſe he paſſed twice through all the ſciences; and to make the doctrines of Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tianity eaſy to him in his childhood, he had two or three Catechiſms compoſed by his tutor,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:032500_0028_0FF2FB1824A5D600"/>
each of them ſuited to his more early or more improved capacity, till at twelve years old he was thought fit to learn that public form, which is more univerſally taught and approv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
               <p>As he was inured to reaſoning from his childhood, ſo he was inſtructed to prove eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing, according to the nature of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, by natural or moral arguments, as far as years would admit: and thus he drew much of his early knowledge from reaſon or from revelation by the force of his judgment, and not merely from his teachers, by the ſtrength of his memory.</p>
               <p>His parents were perſuaded indeed that they ought to teach him the principles of virtue while he was a child, and the moſt important truth of religion both natural and revealed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he was capable of deriving them from the fund of his own reaſon, or of framing a religion for himſelf out of ſo large a book as the Bible. They thought themſelves under the obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that divine command, "Train up a child in the way that he ſhould go, and when he is old he will nor depart from it." And therefore from a child they made him acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Holy Scriptures, and perſuaded him to believe that they were given by the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpiration of God, before it was poſſible for him to take in the arguments from reaſon, hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, tradition, &amp;c. which muſt be joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether to confirm the ſacred canon, and prove
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:032500_0029_0FF2FB1A02EDB5C8"/>
the ſeveral books of the Bible to be divine.—Thus, like Timothy, "he continued in the things which he learned, and had been aſſured of knowing of whom he had learned them." Yet as his years advanced, they thought it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite to ſhow him the ſolid and rational foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations of his faith, that his hope might be built upon the authority of God, and not of men.</p>
               <p>After he arrived at fifteen, he was ſuffered to admit nothing into his full aſſent, till his mind ſaw the rational evidence of the propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition itſelf; or at leaſt till he felt the power of thoſe reaſons which obliged him to aſſent, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on moral evidence and teſtimony, where the evidences of ſenſe or of reaſon were not to be expected. He knew that he was not to hope for mathematical proofs that there is a pope at Rome, that the Turks have dominion over Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea, that St. Paul wrote an Epiſtle to the Ro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mans, that Chriſt was crucified without the gates of Jeruſalem, and that in three days time he roſe from the dead; and yet that there is juſt and reaſonable evidence to enforce and ſupport the belief of all theſe facts. Where truths were too ſublime for preſent compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, he would never admit them as a part of his faith till he ſaw the full evidence of a ſpeaking God and a divine revelation.</p>
               <p>His tutor never impoſed any thing on him with a magiſterial air, but by way of advice re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commended to him ſuch ſtudies and ſuch

methods of improvement, as his experience had long approved; he gave frequent hints of the danger of ſome opinions, and the fatal conſequences of ſome modiſh and miſtaken principles. He let him know generally what ſentiments he himſelf embraced among the divided opinions of the age; and what clear and comprehenſive knowledge, what ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of judgment, ſerenity of mind, and peace of conſcience were to be found in the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples which he had choſen; but he exhorted his pupil ſtill to chooſe wiſely for himſelf, and, in common and ſacred affairs, to frame his own ſentiments by juſt rules of reaſoning:—though Eugenio did not ſuperſtitiouſly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fine his belief to the opinions of his inſtructor, yet he could not but love the man that indulged him ſuch a liberty of thought, and gave him ſuch an admirable clue, by which he let him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf into the ſecrets of knowledge, human and divine: thus, under the happy influences of ſo prudent a ſuperviſor, he traced the paths of learning, and enjoyed the unſpeakable pleaſure of being his own teacher, and of framing his opinions himſelf. By this means he began early to uſe his reaſon with freedom, and to judge for himſelf, without a ſervile ſubmiſſion to the authority of others; and yet to pay a juſt and ſolemn deference to perſons of age and experience, and particularly to thoſe who were proper and appointed guides of his youth, and who led him on ſo gently in the paths of knowledge.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="unknown:032500_0031_0FF2FB2166779478"/>
He was not kept a ſtranger to the errors and follies of mankind, nor was he let looſe amongſt them, either in books or in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, without a guard and a guide. His pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptor let him know the groſs miſtakes and iniquities of men, ancient and modern, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laid him with proper principles of truth and virtue, and furniſhed him with ſuch rules of judgment, as led him more eaſily to diſtinguiſh between good and bad: and thus he was ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured againſt the infection and the poiſon, both of the living and the dead.</p>
               <p>He had early cautions given him to avoid the bantering tribe of mortals, and was inſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to diſtinguiſh a jeſt from an argument, ſo that a loud laugh at his religion never puts him nor his faith out of countenance. He is ever ready to render a reaſon of his Chriſtian hope, and to defend his Creed; but he ſcorns to enter the liſts with ſuch a diſputant that has no artillery but ſquib and flaſh, no argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments beſide grimace and ridicule. Thus he ſupports the character of a Chriſtian with hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>or: <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>You will enquire, perhaps, how he came to attain ſo manly a conduct in life at ſo early an age, and how every thing of the boy was worn off ſo ſoon. Truly, beſides other influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences; it is much owing to the happy manage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment

of Eraſte, (the name of the lady his mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther) ſhe was frequent in the nurſery, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpired ſentiments into his childhood becoming riper years. When there was company in the parlour, with whom ſhe could uſe ſuch a a freedom, ſhe brought her ſon in among them, not to entertain them with his own noiſe and tattle and impertinence but to hear their diſcourſe and ſometimes to anſwer a lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle queſtion or two they might aſk him. When he was grown up to a youth, he was often ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted into the room with his father's acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, and was indulged the liberty to aſk and enquire on ſubjects that ſeemed to be above his years: he was encouraged to ſpeak a ſentence or two of his own thoughts, and thus to learn and practiſe a modeſt aſſureance. But when the company was gone, he was approved and praiſed if he behaved well, or received kind hints of admonition that he might know when he had been too ſilent, and too forward to ſpeak. Thus, by enjoying the advantage of ſociety above the level of his own age and underſtanding, he was always aſpiring to imita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and the exceſſes and defects of his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct were daily noticed and cured.</p>
               <p>His curioſity was <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ratified abroad with new ſights and ſcenes as often as his parents could do it with convenience, that he might not ſtare and wonder at every ſtrange object or occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; but he was made patient of reſtraint and diſappointment, when he ſeemed to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:032500_0033_0FF2FB24EC62BB60"/>
an exceſſive deſire of any needleſs diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. If he ſought any crimial pleaſures, or diverſions attended with great danger and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>convenience, the purſuit of them was abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly forbidden; but it was done in ſo kind a manner, as made the guilt or peril of them appear in the ſtrongeſt light, and thereby they were rendered hateful or formidable, rather than the objects of wiſh or deſire.</p>
               <p>When Eugenio firſt began to go a broad in the world, his companions were recommend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to him by the prudence of his parents; or if he choſe them himſelf, it was ſtill within the reach of his tutor's obſervation, or the notice of his father's eye: nor was he ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to run alooſe into promiſcuous company, till it appeared that his mind was furniſhed with ſteady principles of virtue, till he had knowledge enough to defend thoſe principles, and to repel the aſſaults that might be made upon his faith and manners.</p>
               <p>Yet it was hardly thought fit to truſt him to his own conduct for whole days together, leſt he ſhould meet ſome temptations too hard for his virtue, till he had gained reſolution enough to ſay <hi>no</hi> boldly, and to maintain an obſtinate refuſal of pernicious pleaſures. He was told before hand how the profane and the lewd would uſe all the arts of addreſs, and how ſubtilely they would practiſe upon good hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour with powerful and tempting importuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties. This ſet him ever upon his guard; and
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:032500_0034_0FF2FB28906937B8"/>
though he carried his ſweetneſs of temper al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways about with him, yet he learned to conceal it whereſoever it was neither proper nor ſafe to appear. By a little converſe in the world, he found that it was neceſſary to be poſitive, bold, and unmoveable in rejecting every pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal which might endanger his character or his morals; eſpecially as he ſoon became ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible that a ſoft and cold denial gave courage to new attacks, and left him liable to be teaſed with freſh ſolicitations. He laid down this therefore for a conſtant rule, that where his reaſon had determined any practice to be either plainly ſinful, or utterly inexpedient, he would give ſo firm a denial, upon the principles of virtue and religion, as ſhould for ever diſcour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age any farther ſolicitations. This gave him the character of a man of reſolute virtue, even among the rakes of the time, nor was he ever eſteemed the leſs on this account. At firſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he thought it a happy victory which he had gotten over himſelf, when he could defy the ſhame of the face of vice and infidel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity: he found the ſhorteſt way to conquer this fooliſh ſhame was to renounce it at once; then it was eaſy to practice ſingularity amidſt a profane multitude. And when he began to get courage enough to profeſs reſolute piety without a bluſh, in the midſt of ſuch company as this, Agathus and Eraſte then permitted their ſon to travel abroad, and to ſee more of the world, under the protection of their daily
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:032500_0035_0FF2FB2BF4C74AA0"/>
prayers. His firſt tour was through the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring counties of England; he afterwards enlarged the circuit of his travels till he had viſited foreign nations, and learned the value of his own.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, the reſtraints of his younger years were tempered with ſo much liberty, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naged with ſuch prudence and tenderneſs, and theſe bonds of diſcipline were ſo gradually looſened as faſt as he grew wiſe enough to govern himſelf, that Eugenio always carried about with him an inward conviction of the great love and wiſdom of his parents and his tutor. The humours of the child now and then felt ſome reluctance againſt the pious diſcipline of his parents; but now he is arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at man's eſtate, there is nothing that he looks back upon with greater ſatisfaction than the ſteps of their conduct, and the inſtances of his own ſubmiſſion. He often recounts theſe things with pleaſure, as ſome of the chief favours of heaven, whereby he was guarded through all the dangers and follies of youth and childhood, and effectually kept, through Divine Grace opperating by theſe means, from a thouſand ſorrows, and perhaps from everlaſting ruin.</p>
               <p>Though he was releaſed ſome years from the ſtrictneſs of parental government, yet he ſtill makes his parents his choſen friends: and though they ceaſe to practiſe authority upon him, and abſolute command, yet he pays the
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:032500_0036_0FF2FB2E32B310A0"/>
utmoſt deference to their counſels, and to the firſt notice of their inclinations. You ſhall never find him reſiſting and debating againſt their deſires and propenſities in little common things of life, which are indifferent in them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves; he thinks it carries in it too much contempt of thoſe whom God and nature re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire him to honor. Whenſoever he enters into any important action of life, he takes a filial pleaſure to ſeek advice from his worthy parents; and it is uneaſy to him to attempt any thing of moment without it. He does not indeed univerſally practiſe all their ſentiments, but he gains their conſent to follow his own reaſon and choice.</p>
               <p>Some of the wild young gentlemen of the age may happen to laugh at him for being ſo much a boy ſtill, and for ſhowing ſuch ſubjection to the old folks, (as they call them:) with a ſcorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſmile they bid him "Break off his leading-ſtrings and caſt away his yokes of bondage." But for the moſt part he obſerves, that the ſame perſons ſhake off all yokes at once, and at once break the bonds of nature, duty, and religion: they pay but little regard to their ſuperior in heaven, any more than thoſe on earth, and have forgotten God and their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents together. "Nor will I ever be moved (ſays he) with the reproaches of thoſe who make a jeſt of things ſacred as well as civil, and treat their mother and their Maker with the ſame contempt."</p>

               <p>THE intentions of Eraſtus are very honor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; he has a paſſionate fondneſs for Iſabella, which is eaſily diſcovered in the advantageous picture he gives of her; yet there appears one feature wanting to finiſh the portrait: he ſays nothing of the character and diſpoſition of her mind. Theſe are not what affect him. Her beauty, her graceful air, her lively gaiety, have irreſiſtable charms; theſe are enough for him, and he imagines there can be no greater happineſs than the poſſeſſion of ſo love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a perſon. While under the beams of her eyes, he is tranſported with extaſy; but when ſhe is abſent, languiſhes and pines in reſtleſs uneaſineſs. Is not this love? Eraſtus thinks it is; and believes he is more paſſionately in love than any other man upon earth: but I ſee from whence his error ſprings; he miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>takes for love what is only a corporeal appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tite.</p>
               <p>NEVER did love appear more ardent than between Lyſander and Daphne. Innumerable obſtacles ſtood in their way, over which their courage enabled them to triumph. Bolts, bars, and walls ſecured the fair priſoner. Three or four prudiſh jailors with a devout twang of the noſe exhorted her to continence; and propoſing themſelves for an example, invited her to ſigh like them for no other huſband than the ſpouſe in the Canticles: but the lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der delivered her at once from the cloiſters

and theſe lectures. Lyſander, whoſe father at the ſame time was endeavouring to diſinher<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>it him, preferred the intereſt of his heart to that of his fortune, and the poſſeſſion of Daph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ne to the ties of blood. He fled with her to vow at the foot of the altar an eternal fidelity.—The firſt year is not yet paſt, and Lyſander is already falſe. Daphne weeps, ſighs, and la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: however, ſhe has comforters who may one day help her to revenge his perfidy. But what can be the cauſe of this ſudden change? Lyſander and Daphne had miſtaken for love the powerful impulſes of a warm conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution. This deceived them, and as they are both impatient and impetuous ſpirits, their vexations and diſappointments are as keen as their appetites are violent.</p>
               <p>CALISTA was young and beautiful, bleſt with an uncommon ſhare of ſolid ſenſe enliven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the moſt ſprightly wit. Agathocles ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded her very little in point of age; he was well made, brave, and prudent. He had the good fortune to be introduced at Caliſta's, where his looks, wandering indifferently over a brilliant circle, ſoon diſtinguiſhed and fixed upon her: but endeavouring to recover him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from the ſhort extaſy which his firſt glance produced, he immediately reproached himſelf as being guilty of rudeneſs and diſregard to the reſt of the company; and this fault he endeavoured to repair, by looking round upon other objects. Vain attempt! they are at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracted
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:032500_0039_0FF2FB3734E1EB08"/>
by an irreſiſtable charm, and again turned towards Caliſta. He bluſhed as well as ſhe, whilſt a ſweet emotion hitherto unfelt played about his heart and diſconcerted all his looks. They both became at the ſame time more timid and more curious. With pleaſure he gazed at Caliſta, and yet could not do it without trembling: whilſt ſhe, ſecretly pleaſed with this flattering preference, looked at him by ſtealth. They were both afraid, but eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially Caliſta, of being caught by the other in the fact, and both were ſo almoſt every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. The hour of ſeparation came, and they thought came too ſoon. They made painful reflections on the rapidity of time. Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, however, did not ſuffer a total ſeparation to take place: for the image of Caliſta was deeply engraven on the mind of Agathocles, and the lineaments of his perſon were as ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly impreſſed on that of Caliſta.

perfect contentment, the ſoothing delight, which they taſted in the preſence of each oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, would not ſuffer them to be longer ignorant of the cauſe of their melancholy. Agathocies now collected himſelf, and aſſumed the cour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>age to addreſs Caliſta; he accoſted her with the moſt polite and obliging expreſſions, and for the firſt time enjoyed the happineſs of a particular converſation with her. He had hitherto ſeen only her exterior charms: he now diſcovered the beauties of her mind, the integrity of her heart, the dignity of her ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the delicacy of her wit; but what ſtill more delighted him, was the pleaſing hope that ſhe did not think him unworthy of her eſteem. From this time his viſits became very frequent; in every one of which he diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered ſome new perfection. This is the characteriſtic of real merit; it is a gainer by being laid open to the inſpection of a judicious eye. A man of underſtanding will ſoon be diſguſted with the wanton, the fooliſh, and the giddy: but if he has conceived a paſſion for a woman worthy of himſelf, time, ſo far from weakening his attachment, can only ſerve to increaſe and ſtrengthen it.</p>
               <p>The fixed inclination of Agathocles made him now ſenſible, that which he felt for Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſta was love; and that of the moſt tender and paſſionate kind. This he knew; but Caliſta was ſtill unacquainted with it, or at leaſt had never learnt it from his lips. Love is timor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:032500_0041_0FF2FB3DD3CF9050"/>
and diſſident: a bold and daring ſuitor is not the lover of the lady he addreſſes; the only object of his love is <hi>pleaſure.</hi> At laſt he took the reſolution to lay open his heart to Caliſta, but not in the ſtudied language of a romantic paſſion. "Lovely Caliſta," ſaid he, "ingenuouſly, it is not merely eſteem that en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gages me to you; but the moſt paſſionate and tender affection. I feel that I cannot live with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out you. Can you without reluctance reſolve to make me happy? I have hitherto loved without offending you, this is a tribute which your merit demands; but may I flatter my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf with the hope, that you will make me ſome ſmall return?" A coquette would have affected to be diſpleaſed; but Caliſta not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly heard her lover without interruption, but anſwered him without ſeverity, and permitted him to hope. Nor did ſhe put his conſtancy to a needleſs trial. The happineſs for which he ſighed was deferred no longer than was proper, to make the neceſſary preparations. The marriage-ſettlements were eaſily adjuſted, for in theſe, ſordid intereſt had no ſhare; this ſolemn contract chiefly conſiſted in a mutual exchange of hearts, and this was already per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed. What will be the lot of this newly wedded pair? I will venture to foretel that it will be the happieſt that mortals can enjoy on earth. No pleaſure is comparable to that which affects the heart; nor does any o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther affect it with ſuch exquiſite delight as the pleaſure of loving and being beloved. To
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:032500_0042_0FF2FB4161CCDCD0"/>
this tender union of ſouls we can never apply the words of Democritus, that "the pleaſure of love is only a ſhort epilepſy." He without doubt had the ſenſual pleaſure in his thought, which is ſo different from love, that the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be without the paſſion, and the paſſion without the enjoyment. Their love, will be conſtant. This I dare propheſy, and I know the cauſe: their paſſion is not founded on the dazzling charms of beauty, they are both the friends of virtue: they love each other on this account; their love, therefore, will laſt as long as their virtue, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of that is ſecured by their union:—for nothing can ſecure our perſeverance in the paths of wiſdon ſo effectually as having inceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly a loving and beloved example walking before us. Their felicity can never be diſturb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed unleſs by thoſe diſaſters and misfortunes from which their mutual tenderneſs cannot ſhelter them: but ſuppoſing theſe ſhould full to their ſhare, they would then only partake of the common lot of mankind. Thoſe who have never taſted the tender delights of love are equally expoſed to diſappointment; and the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

               <p>The luxury of Capua deſtroyed the braveſt army which Italy ever ſaw, fluſhed with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, and commanded by Hannibal. The moment Capua was taken, the moment the walls of Carthage trembled. They caught the

infection, and grew fond of pleaſure; which rendered them effeminate, and of courſe an eaſy prey to their enemies.</p>
               <p>IT is to the victory over Antiochus, and the conqueſt of Aſia, that Pliny dates the corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the manners of the Roman common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, and of the fatal change that happened in it by introducing at Rome, with the rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es it brought thither, a taſte for luxury and vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luptuouſneſs. Aſia conquered Rome by its vices. Foreign riches put an end to the love of induſtry and the antient ſimplicity which had been the principles of its honor and ſtrength. Luxury, which entered Rome as in triumph, with the ſuperb ſpoils of Aſia, brought with it in its train all kinds of diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders and crimes, made more havock than the moſt numerous armies could have done, and, in that manner avenged the conquered globe. Thus the face of the ſtate was changed, vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, valour, and diſintereſtedneſs were no longer eſteemed; the oppoſite vices prevailed, and the government from juſt and wiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came tyrannical and inſupportable.</p>

               <p>WHEN Damon was ſentenced by Dionyſius of Syracuſe to die on a certain day, he begged permiſſion, in the interim, to retire to his own country, to ſet the affairs of his diſconſolate family in order.

Pythi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as

as heard the conditions, and did not wait for an application upon the part of Damon; he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly offered himſelf as ſecurity for his friend, which, being accepted, Damon was immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſet at liberty. The king and all the courtiers were aſtoniſhed at this action; and therefore when the day of execution drew near, his majeſty had the curioſity to viſit Pythias in his confinement. After ſome con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation on the ſubject of friendſhip, in which the tyrant delivered it as his opinion that ſelf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>intereſt was the ſole mover of human actions; as for virtue, friendſhip, benevolence, love of one's country, and the like; he looked upon them as terms invented by the wiſe to keep in awe and impoſe upon the weak. "My lord," ſaid Pythias, with a firm voice and noble aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect, "I would it were poſſible that I might ſuffer a thouſand deaths, rather than my friend ſhould fail in any article of his honor. He cannot fail therein my lord: I am as confident of his virtue as I am of my own exiſtence.—But I pray, I beſeech the gods, to preſerve the life and integrity of my dear Damon to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether: oppoſe him, ye winds, prevent the eagerneſs and impatience of his honorable en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours, and ſuffer him not to arrive till by my death I have redeemed a life a thouſand times of more conſequence, of more value, than my own; more eſtimable to his lovely wife; to his precious little innocents, to his friends, to his country.

die the worſt of deaths in my Damon." Dio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyſius was awed and confounded by the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of theſe ſentiments, and by the manner in which they were uttered: he felt his heart ſtruck by a ſlight ſenſe of invading truth;—but it ſerved rather to perplex than undeceive him. The fatal day arrived. Pythias was brought forth, and walked amidſt the guards with a ſerious, but ſatisfied air, to the place of execution. Dionyſius was already there; he was exalted on a moving throne, that was drawn by ſix white horſes, and fat penſive and attentive to the priſoner. Pythias came, he vaulted lightly on the ſcaffold, and beholding for ſome time the apparatus of his death, he turned with a placid countenance, and addreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſpectators: "My prayers are heard," he cried, "the gods are propitous; you know, my friends, that the winds have been contrary till yeſterday. Damon could not come, he could not conquer impoſſibilites; he will be here to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, and the blood which is ſhed to-day, ſhall have ranſomed the life of my friend. O could I eraſe from your boſom every doubt, every mean ſuſpicion, of the honor of the man for whom I am about to ſuffer, I ſhall go to my death even as I would to my bridal. Be it ſufficient in the mean time, that my friend will be found noble, that his truth is unimpeach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able; that he will ſpeadily prove it: that he is now on his way, hurrying on, accuſing him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and adverſe elements, and the gods: but

I haſte to prevent his ſpeed; executioner, to your office." As he pronounced the laſt words, a buz began to riſe among the remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt of the people; a diſtant voice was heard; the croud caught the words, and Stop Stop the execution, was repeated by the whole aſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>embly: a man at full ſpeed; the throng gave way to his approach: he was mounted on a ſteed of foam: in an inſtant he was off his horſe, on the ſcaffold, and held Pythias ſtraitly embraced. "You are ſafe," he cried, "you are ſafe, my friend, my beloved friend, the gods be praiſed, you are ſafe. I now have nothing but death to ſuffer and am delivered from the anguiſh of thoſe reproaches which I gave myſelf, for having endangered a life ſo much dearer than my own." Pale, cold, and half ſpeechleſs in the arms of his Damon, Pythias replied in broken accents—"Fatal haſte!—Cruel impatience!—What envious powers have wrought impoſſibilities in your favour?—But I will not be wholly diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.—Since I cannot die to ſave, I will not ſurvive you." Dionyſius heard, beheld, and conſidered all with aſtoniſhment. His heart was touched, he wept, and leaving his throne, he aſcended the ſcaffold.

of a ſudden influence from above. The ſtreets and the crowds of Mecca diſappeared; I found myſelf ſitting on the declivity of a mountain, and perceived at my right hand an angel, whom I knew to be Arozan, the miniſter of reproof. When I ſaw him, I was afraid, I caſt mine eye upon the ground, and was about to deſperate his anger, when he commanded me to be ſilent. "Almet," ſaid he, "thou haſt devoted thy life to meditation, that thy counſel might deliver ignorance from the mazes of error, and deter preſumption from the precipice of guilt; but the book of nature thou haſt read without underſtanding. It is again open before thee; look up, conſider it, and be wiſe."</p>
               <p>I looked up and beheld an incloſure, beauti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful as the gardens of paradiſe, but of a ſmall extent. Through the middle there was a green walk; at the end a wild deſart, and beyond im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable darkneſs. The walk was ſhaded with trees of every kind, that were covered at once with bloſſoms and fruit; innumerable birds were ſinging in the branches; the graſs was intermingled with flowers, which impreg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated the breeze with fragrance, and painted the path with her beauty: on one ſide flowed a gentle tranſparent ſtream, which was juſt heard to murmur over the golden ſands that ſparkled at the bottom; and on the other were walks and bowers, fountains, grottos, and caſcades, which diverſified the ſcene with
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:032500_0059_0FF2FB72D9712B18"/>
endleſs variety, but did not conceal the bounds.</p>
               <p>While I was gazing in a tranſport of delight and wonder on this enchanting ſpot, I perceiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a man ſtealing along the walk with a thoughtful and deliberate pace: his eyes were fixed upon the earth, and his arms croſſed on his boſſom: he ſometimes ſtarted as if a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den pang had ſeized him; his countenance expreſſed ſolicitude and terror; he looked round with a ſigh, and having gazed a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on the deſart that lay before him, he ſeemed as if he wiſhed to ſtop, but was impel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led forward by ſome inviſible power; his fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, however, ſoon ſettled again into a calm melancholy; his eye was again fixed on the ground; and he went on as before, with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parent reluctance, but without emotion. I was ſtruct with this appearance; and turning haſtily to the angel, was about to enquire what could produce ſuch infelicity in a being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with every object that could gratify every ſenſe; but he prevented my requeſt: "The book of nature, ſaid he, is before thee; look up, conſider it, and be wiſe." I looked, and beheld a valley between two mountains that were craggy and barren; on the path there was no verdure, and the mountains af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded no ſhade; the ſun buriſed in the ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nith, and every ſpring was dried up; but the valley terminated in a country that was pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant and fertile, ſhaded with woods and adorn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with buildings.

Amanda was in the bloom of her youth and beauty, when the lord of the manor, who often called in at the farmer's houſe as he followed his country ſports, fell paſſionately in love with her. He was a man of great generoſity, but from a looſe education had contracted a hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty averſion to marriage. He therefore enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained a deſing upon Amanda's virtue, which at preſent he thought fit to keep private.—The innocent creature, who never ſuſpected his intentions, was pleaſed with his perſon, and having obſerved his growing paſſion for her, hoped, by ſo advantageous a match, ſhe might quickly be in a capacity for ſupporting her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poveriſhed relations. One day as he called to ſee her, he found her in tears over a letter ſhe

had juſt received from her friend, which gave an account that her father had lately been ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ped of every thing by an execution. The lov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, who with ſome difficulty found out the cauſe of her grief, took this occaſion to make her a propoſal. It is impoſſible to expreſs A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manda's confuſion when ſhe found his preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions were not honourable. She was now de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerted of all her hopes, and had no power to ſpeak; but ruſhing from him in the utmoſt diſturbance, locked herſelf up in her chamber. He immediately diſpatched a meſſenger to her father with the following letter:</p>

                     <p>YOUR father and I have juſt now receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a letter from a gentleman who pretends love to you, with a propoſal that inſults our misfortunes, and would throw us to a lower degree of miſery than any thing which is come upon us. How could this barbarous man think that the tendereſt of parents would be tempted to ſupply their wants by giving up the beſt of their children to infamy and ruin? It is a mean and cruel artifice to make this propoſal at a time when he thinks our neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſities muſt compel us to any thing; but we will not eat the bread of ſhame, and therefore we charge thee not to think of us, but to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>void the ſnare which is laid for thy virtue.—Beware of pitying us: it is not ſo bad as you have perhaps been told. All things will yet be well, and I ſhall write my child better news.</p>

His maſter was impa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient to know the ſucceſs of his propoſal, and therefore broke open the letter privately to ſee the contents. He was not a little moved at ſo true a picture of virtue in diſtreſs; but at the ſame time was infinitely ſurpriſed to find his offers rejected. However, he reſolv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not to ſuppreſs the letter, but carefully ſeal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed it up again, and carried it to Amanda.

                     <p>AFTER very much perplexity in myſelf, and revolving how to acquaint you with my own ſentiments, and expoſtulate with you concerning yours, I have choſen this way;—by which means I can be at once revealed to you, or, if you pleaſe lie concealed. If I do not within a few days find the effect which I hope from this, the whole affair ſhall be buri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in oblivion. But, alas! what am I going to do, when I am about to tell you that I love you? But after I have done ſo, I am to aſſure you, that with all the paſſion which ever en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered a tender heart, I know I can baniſh you from my ſight forever, when I am convinced that you have no inclinations towards me but
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:032500_0069_0FF2FB905850BF28"/>
to my diſhonor. But, alas! Sir why ſhould you ſacrifice the real and eſſential happineſs of life to the opinion of a world, that moves upon no other foundation but profeſſed error and prejudice? You all can obſerve, that riches alone do not make you happy, and yet give up every thing elſe when it ſtands in competi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with riches. Since the world is ſo bad that religion is left to us ſilly women, and you men act generally upon principles of profit and pleaſure, I will talk to you without argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from any thing but what may be moſt to your advantage, as a man of the world. And I will lay before you the ſtate of the caſe;—ſuppoſing that you had it in your power to make me your miſtreſs or your wife, and hope to convince you that the latter is more for your intereſt, and will contribute more to your pleaſure.</p>
                     <p>We will ſuppoſe then the ſcene was laid, and you were now in expectation of the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaching evening wherein I was to meet you, and be carried to what convenient corner of the town you thought fit, to conſummate all which your want on imagination has promiſed you in the poſſeſſion of one who is in the bloom of youth, and in the reputation of innocence: you would ſoon have enough of me, as I am ſprightly, young, gay an <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>airy. When fancy is ſated, and finds all the promiſes it made itſelf falſe, where is now the innocence which charmed you? The firſt hour you are alone
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:032500_0070_0FF2FB93EB524178"/>
you will find that the pleaſure of a debauchee is only that of a deſtroyer? he blaſts all the fruit he taſtes; and where the brute has been devouring, there is nothing left worthy the reliſh of man. Reaſon reſumes her place af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter imagination is cloyed; and I am, with the utmoſt diſtreſs and confuſion, to behold my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf the cauſe of uneaſy reflections to you, to be viſited by ſtealth, and dwell for the future with the two companions, (the moſt unfit for each other in the world) ſolitude and guilt.—I will not inſiſt upon the ſhameful obſcurity we ſhould paſs our time in, nor run over the little ſhort ſnatches of freſh air and free com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce which all people muſt be ſatisfied with, whoſe actions will not bear examination, but leave them to your reflections, who have ſeen much of that life of which I have but a mere idea.</p>
                     <p>On the other hand, if you can be ſo good and generous as to make me your wife, you may promiſe yourſelf all the obedience and tender<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

Whatever gratifications you may promiſe yourſelf from an agreeable perſon, whatever compliances from an eaſy temper, whatever conſolations from a ſincere friendſhip, you may expect as the due of your generoſity. What at preſent in your ill view you promiſe yourſelf from me, will be follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by diſtaſte and ſatiety; but the tranſports of a virtuous love are the leaſt part of its happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:032500_0071_0FF2FB96754C3DC8"/>
The raptures of innocent paſſion are but like lightning to the day, they rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupt than advance the pleaſure of it. How happy then is that life to be, where the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt pleaſures of ſenſe are but the loweſt parts of its felicity.</p>
                     <p>"Now am I to repeat to you the unnatural requeſt of taking me in direct terms. I know there ſtands between me and that happineſs, the haughty daughter of a man who can give you ſuitably to your fortune. But if you weigh the attendance and behavior of her who comes to you in partnerſhip of your fortune, and expect an equivalent, with that of her who enters your houſe as honoured and obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged by that permiſſion, whom of the two will you chooſe? You, perhaps, will think fit to ſpend a day abroad in the common entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of men of ſenſe and fortune, ſhe will think herſelf ill uſed in that abſenſe, and contrive at home an expence proportioned to the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance which you make in the world. She is in all things to have a regard to the fortune which ſhe brought you, I to the fortune to which you introduced me. The commerce between you two will eternally have the air of a bargain, between us of a friendſhip; joy will ever enter into the room with you, and kind wiſhes attend my benefactor when he leaves it. Aſk yourſelf, how would you be pleaſed to enjoy for ever the pleaſure of having laid an immediate obligation on a greatful mind?—
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:032500_0072_0FF2FB991FC846B8"/>
Such will be your caſe with me. In the oth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er marriage you will live in a conſtant compar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſon of benefits, and never know the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of confering or receiving any.</p>
                     <p>"It may be you will, after all, act rather in the prudential way, according to the ſenſe of the ordinary world. I know not what I think or ſay, when that melancholy reflection comes upon me: but ſhall only add more, that it is in your power to make me your grateful wife, but never your abandoned miſtreſs.</p>

               <head>FRATERNAL AFFECTION.</head>
               <p>IN the beginning of the ſixteenth century, the Portugeſe carracks ſailed from Liſbon to Goa, a very great, rich, and flouriſhing colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of that nation in the Eaſt-Indies. There
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:032500_0077_0FF2FBA63903B7E8"/>
was no leſs than twelve hundred ſouls, marin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, paſſengers, prieſts, and friars, on board one of theſe veſſels. The beginning of their voyage was proſperous; they had doubled the ſouthern extremity of the great continent of Africa, called the cape of Good Hope, and were ſteering their courſe northeaſt, to the great continent of India, when ſome gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men on board, who, having ſtudied geography and navigation, (arts which reflect honor on the poſſeſſors) found in the latitude in which they were then ſailing a large ridge of rocks laid down in the ſea-charts. They no ſooner made this diſcovery, than they acquainted the captain of the ſhip with the affair, deſiring him to communicate the ſame to the pilot;—which requeſt he immediately granted, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comended him to lie by in the night, and ſlack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en ſail by day, until they ſhould be paſt the danger. It is a cuſtom always among the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tugueſe abſolutely to commit the failing part, or the navigation of the veſſel to the pilot, who is anſwerable with his head for the ſafe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct or carriage of the king's ſhips, or thoſe belonging to private traders; and he is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der no manner of direction from the captain, who commands in every other reſpect.</p>
               <p>The pilot being one of thoſe ſelf-ſufficient men who think every hint given them from others in the way of their profeſſion deroga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory from their underſtandings, took it as an affront to be taught his art, and inſtead of
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:032500_0078_0FF2FBA8E5E67BF0"/>
complying with the captain's requeſt, actaul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly crowded more ſail than the veſſel had car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried before. They had not ſailed many hours, but juſt about the dawn of day, a terrible diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſter befel them, which would have been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented if they had lain by. The ſhip ſtruck upon a rock. I leave to the reader's imagin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, what a ſcene of horror this dreadful acci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent muſt occaſion among twelve hundred per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, all in the ſame inevitable danger; behold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with fearful aſtoniſhment, that inſtantane<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous death which now ſtared them in the face!</p>
               <p>In this diſtreſs, the captain ordered the pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace to be launched, into which having toſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a ſmall quantity of biſcuit and ſome boxes of marmalade, he jumped in himſelf with nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen others, who with their ſwords, prevented the coming in of any more, leſt the boat ſhould ſink. In this condition they put off into the great Indian ocean, without a compaſs to ſteer by, or freſh water but what might happen to fall from the heavens, whoſe mercy alone could deliver them. After they had rowed to and fro four days in this miſerable condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the captain, who had been for ſome time very ſick and weak, died; this added, if poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, to their miſery, for as they now fell into confuſion, every one would govern, and none would obey. This obliged them to elect one of their own company to command them, whoſe orders they implicitly agreed to follow. This perſon propoſed to the company to draw
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:032500_0079_0FF2FBAC75E84B00"/>
lots, and caſt every fourth man over-board; as their ſmall ſtock of proviſions was ſo far ſpent, as not to be able at a very ſhort allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance to ſuſtain life above three days longer.—They were now nineteen perſons in all: in this number were a friar and a carpenter, both of whom they would exempt, as the one was uſeful to abſolve and comfort them in their laſt extremity, and the other to repair the pin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nace in caſe of a leak or other accident. The ſame compliment they paid to their new cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, he being the odd man, and his life of much conſequence. He refuſed their indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gence a great while; but at laſt they obliged him to acquieſce, ſo that there were four to die out of the ſixteen remaining perſons.</p>
               <p>The three firſt, after having confeſſed and received abſolution, ſubmitted to their fate.—The fourth, whom fortune condemned, was a Portugeſe gentleman that had a younger bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in the boat, who ſeeing him about to be thrown over-board, moſt tenderly embraced him, and with tears in his eyes beſought him to let him die in his room, enforcing his arguments by telling him that he was a married man, and had a wife and children at Goa, beſides the care of three ſiſters, who abſolutely depended upon him; that as for himſelf, he was ſingle, and his life of no great importance: he there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore conjured him to ſuffer him to ſupply his place. The elder brother, aſtoniſhed and melt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with this generoſity, replied, that ſince
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:032500_0080_0FF2FBAE330182A8"/>
the divine Providence had appointed him to ſuffer, it would be wicked and unjuſt to permit any other to die for him, eſpecially a brother, to whom he was ſo infinitely obliged. The younger, perſiſting in his purpoſe, would take no denial: but throwing himſelf on his knees, held his brother ſo faſt, that the company could not diſengage them. Thus they diſputed for a while, the elder brother bidding him be a father to his children, and recommended his wife to his protection, and as he would inherit his eſtate, to take care of their common ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; but all he could ſay could not make the young man deſiſt. This was a ſcene of tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs that muſt fill every breaſt ſuſceptible of generous impreſſions with pity. At laſt the conſtancy of the elder yielded to the piety of the other. He acquieſced, and ſuffered the gallant youth to ſupply his place, who being caſt into the ſea, and a good ſwimmer, ſoon got to the ſtern of the pinnace, and laid hold of the rudder with his right hand, which being perceived by one of the ſailors, he cut off the hand with his ſword; then dropping into the ſea, he preſently caught hold again with his left, which received the ſame fate by a ſecond blow; thus diſmembered of both hands, he made a ſhift notwithſtanding to keep himſelf above water with his ſeer and two ſtumps, which he held bleeding upwards.</p>
               <p>This moving ſpectacle ſo raiſed the pity of the whole company, that they cried out, He i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

but one man, let us endeavour to ſave his life; and he was accordingly taken into the boat, where he had his hands bound up as well as the place and circumſtances could permit.—They rowed all that night and the next morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing: when the ſun aroſe, as if heaven would reward the gallantry and piety of this young man, they deſcried land, which proved to be the mountains Mozambique, in Africa, nor far from a Portugueſe colony. Thither they all ſafe arrived, where they remained until the next ſhip for Liſbon paſſed by and carried them to Goa.</p>
               <p>At that city, Linſchoton, a writer of good credit and eſteem, aſſures us, that he himſelf ſaw them land, ſupped with the two brothers that very night, beheld the younger with his ſtumps, and had the ſtory from both their mouths as well as from the reſt of the compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny.</p>

               <p>CHIOMARA, the wife of Ortiagon, a Gan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh prince, was equally admirable for her beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and chaſtity.

Chiomary, among many other ladies, was taken priſoner, and committed to the care of a cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turion, no leſs paſſionate for money than wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men.

prevail upon her, and ſubvert her conſtancy, he thought he might employ force with a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man who misfortune had reduced to ſlave<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. Afterwards, to make her amends for that treatment, he offered to reſtore her liberty; but not without ranſom. He agreed with her for a certain ſum, and to conceal this deſign from the Romans, he permited her to ſend any one of the priſoners ſhe ſhould chooſe to her relations, and aſſigned a place near the riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er where the lady ſhould be exchanged for gold. By accident there was one of her own ſlaves among the priſoners. Upon him ſhe fix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: and the centurion ſoon after carried her beyond the advanced poſts, under cover of a dark night. The next evening two of the relations of the princeſs came to the place ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, whither the centurion alſo carried his captive. When they delivered him the Attic talent they had brought, which was the ſum they had agreed on, the lady, in her own language, ordered thoſe who came to receive her to draw their ſwords and kill the centurion, who was then amuſing himſelf with weighing the gold. Then, charmed with having revenged the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury done her chaſtity, ſhe took the head of the officer, which ſhe had cut off with her own hands and hiding it under her robe, went to her huſband Ortiagon, who had returned home after the defeat of his troops.

With a face covered with a ſudden bluſh, and at the ſame time expreſſing her fierce indignation, ſhe declared the outrage which had been done her, and the revenge ſhe had taken for it.</p>

               <p>Three ſharpers, having found means to be introduced to a king, told him that they could weave a brocade of exquiſite workmanſhip, and of ſo rare a property, that it would be inviſible to any perſon who was either baſe born, diſhonored by his wife, or had been guilty of any villainy. The king deſirous to

The chamberlain went: but when the weavers told him the property of the brocade, he had not courage enough to ſay that he did not ſee it, but told the king that the work went on, and that the piece would be of unparalleled beauty. The king ſent another nobleman, who, from the ſame motive, made the ſame report. After that he ſent many others, who all declared they had ſeen the piece. At length the king went himſelf, and upon entrance ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved that their whole converſation turned upon the ſucceſs of their work; one ſaying, "here is a noble foliage!" another, "what a grand deſign!" a third, "how beautiful is this colour!" But as he ſaw nothing all this time except the loom, and as he could not ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect the report which had been brought him

by ſo many courtiers without any variation, he was ſtruck to the heart, and began to doubt of the legitimacy of his own birth. However, he thought it moſt prudent to expreſs himſelf highly pleaſed with the goodneſs and beauty of this maſter piece of art. At the end of three days, he ſent of his ſteward, who, that he might not loſe his honor, praiſed the work even more extravagantly than the king had done.—This redoubled the king's vexation; and he and all the courtiers remained in the utmoſt doubt and perplexity; no one daring to confeſs that this famous piece was a non entity to him.</p>
               <p>In this ſtate the affair continued, till upon occaſion of a great feſtival, ſome courtiers preſſed his majeſty to have robes made of this ſilk in honor of the day. When the weavers came to the preſence chamber, and were ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with the king's purpoſe, they inſiſted that none could make up the brocade ſo well as themſelves, pretended that they had bro't it with them curiouſly wrapped up, and buſied themſelve as if they were unfolding it. They alſo took meaſure of his majeſty, handled their ſciſſors, and practiſed all the motions of perſons buſy in cutting out.

At length a Moor, who belonged to the king's ſtables, could not help crying out, "The king is in his ſhirt, the king is naked." The ice was now broke.

Upon this orders were given to apprehend the ſharpers; but they had very wifely taken care of themſelves, and made off with the money, gold, ſilver, ſilk, and other valuables, with which the king had ſupplied them.

Though lord Amiable was not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to any of thoſe vices Maſkwell was pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curer

of, yet this wretch had cunning enough to draw him into all. With drinking, his health ſoon began to be impaired; with loſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es his temper was ruffled; with wenching, that fondneſs and cordial love he uſed to ſhew to his lady, began to ceaſe. Prudentia was not a little concerned at this conduct: ſhe too well knew all his vices; yet diſcreetly thought that any violent oppoſition would but heighten the miſchief: ſhe took care to make home as eaſy to him as poſſible: ſtudious of obliging, ſhe never diſguſted him by harſh reproaches and ſatirical reflections on his conduct; neith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, though careful to pleaſe him, did ſhe run into an extreme of fondneſs; ſhe was not fond when ſhe thought it would be diſagreeable; for ſhe knew that a wife without diſcretion my make the tendereſt endearments the moſt troubleſome. Prudentia was gay or fond as ſhe found her lord in the temper to receive ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; and, without letting him know that ſhe had information of his gaming abroad, would propoſe a game of cards at home with ſuch company as ſhe thought would moſt pleaſe him, and never forgot to include Mr. Maſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well.</p>
               <p>Sometimes her propoſal was accepted; and by that means ſhe found out the ſharper, the pander, the flatterer, and the villain, in the ſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-tongued Mr. Maſkwell.</p>
               <p>It happened that Mrs. Thoughtleſs, a beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful lady, who had married my lord's broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er,
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:032500_0089_0FF2FBC6CE4A3FB8"/>
was extremely uneaſy at being informed of her huſband's keeping company with women of the town, and in danger of being ruined by ſharpers at gaming: ſhe came one day to my lord to complain of his brother's bad conduct and falſehood to her bed: ſhe cried, ſhe raved, and threatened not to live a moment with him longer. My lord did what he could to paci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy her, but all in vain; my lady ſucceeded bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, who taking this opportunity to ſhew my lord his own foibles, thus addreſſed herſelf to her ſiſter: "I fancy, dear ſiſter, you want a little diſcreet good-humour to reclaim your huſband; beauty and wit will not avail with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out diſcretion; there is a paſſive kind of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue neſſary to ſhew him his folly, it muſt not be done with ill-nature and conſtant reproach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es on his conduct, which I am afraid is your method. If my lord Amiable was guilty of ſuch follies, which I dare affirm he never will, I ſhould myſelf act as I adviſe you. You have beauty enough to pleaſe a huſband, have there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an equal deſire to do it: be the more ſtudious of his humour as he is more faulty in his conduct, and let your affability ſhew his injuſtice in wronging you: the miſtreſſes the men viſit exert all their little arts to pleaſe them, for gain only, without honor, without conſcience, and without love: why then ſhould not a virtuous woman ſhew as great a deſire to pleaſe her huſband as as theſe artful jilts do to pleaſe a gallant."</p>

Mrs. Thoughtleſs was pleaſed with her ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice: my lord approved of it and was ſecretly touched to the ſoul for his tranſgreſſions a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt ſo incomparable a wife, who had acted what ſhe ſpoke, and had more perſonal charms than the woman his falſe friend had introdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced him to. When he had recollected him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he propoſed that his ſiſter ſhould bring her huſband to dinner the next day; and that his lady ſhould repeat what ſhe had alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy ſaid, and he was aſſured that it would have and excellent effect. It was agreed on; but with this diſcreet caution of Lady Amiable, that her diſcourſe ſhould be directed to my lord, to take off any ſuſpicion that it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended for Mr. Thoughtleſs. The next day they met, and my Lord Amiable ſaw himſelf prudently attacked by his lady for his real faults, while ſhe ſeemed only to take them for imaginary ones. To what ſhe had ſaid before, ſhe added ſome reflections on the ill choice men of quality make of their acquaintance, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong whom are the merry, laughing buffoons, who lead them into all the vices of the age, under the falſe preteuce of friendſhip; at which words, looked at her lord in the moſt tender manner, ſhe concluded, "Theſe, my lord, are wretched friends, who lead you into ſuch evil; on the contrary, the friendſhip between man and wife is cemented by virtue, love, and intereſt, and cannot be diſſolved without deſtroying the happineſs of both. Let

At theſe laſt words, my lord, overcome with the gentle reproach, flung himſelf about her neck, and amidſt a thouſand kiſſes, prom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſed mutual love. Theſe tranſports were fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed by the like in my lady's brother and wife, who owned himſelf a convert to virtue and matrimonial affection.</p>
               <p>Thus what neither beauty nor wit could ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect, diſcretion did: their lives afterwards were proſperous, and their deaths happy:

               <p>SIR William Aſkew, of Kelſay, in Lincoln<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire, was bleſſed with ſeveral daughters.

and happineſs, obliged her to marry a gentleman who had nothing to recommend him but his fortune, and who was a moſt big<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oted papiſt. No ſooner was he convinced of his wife's regard for the doctrines of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation from popery, than, by the inſtiga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the prieſts, he violently drove her from his houſe, though ſhe had borne him two chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and her conduct was unexceptionable.—Abandoned by her huſband, ſhe came up to London, in order to procure a divorce, and to make herſelf known to that part of the court who either profeſſed, or were favourers of proteſtantiſm: but, as Henry VIII, with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of parliament, had juſt enacted the law of the ſix articles, commonly called the bloody ſtatute, ſhe was cruelly betrayed by her own huſband; and upon his information, taken into cuſtody, and examined concerning her faith. The act above mentioned denounced death to all thoſe who ſhould deny the doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine of <hi>tranſubſtantiation;</hi> or, that the bread and wine made uſe of in the ſacrament was not converted, after conſecration, into the <hi>real</hi> bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and blood of Chriſt; or maintain the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of receiving the ſacrament in both kinds; or affirm, that it was lawful for prieſts to mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry; that the vows of celibacy might be bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken; that private maſſes were of no avail;—that auricular confeſſion to a prieſt was not ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to ſalvation. Upon theſe articles, ſhe was examined by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 words">

lord-mayor of London, and the biſhop's chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellor; and to all their queries gave proper and pertinent anſwers; but not being ſuch as they approved, ſhe was ſent back to priſon; where ſhe remained eleven days to ruminate alone on her alarming ſituation, and was deni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the ſmall conſolation of a friendly viſit.—The king's council being at Greenwich ſhe was once more examined by chancellor Wrio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſley, Gardiner, biſhop of Wincheſter, Dr. Cox, and Dr. Robinſon; but not being able to convince her of her ſuppoſed errors, ſhe was ſent to the Tower. It was ſtrongly ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected, that Mrs. Aſkew was favoured by ſome ladies of high rank; and that ſhe carried on a religious correſpondence with the queen.—So that the chancellor Wriotheſley, hoping that he might diſcover ſomething that would afford matter of impeachment againſt that princeſs, the earl of Hertford, or his counteſs, who all favoured the reformation, ordered her to be put to the rack: but her fortitude in ſuffering, and her reſolution not to betray her friends, was proof againſt that diabolical inven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Not a groan, not a word could be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torted from her. The chancellor, provoked with what he called her obſtanacy, augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her tortures with his own hands, and with unheard of violence: her courage and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy were invincible; and theſe barbarians gained nothing by their crueltiés, but ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting diſgrace and infamy. As ſoon as ſhe
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:032500_0094_0FF2FBD8BACB8B50"/>
was taken from the rack ſhe fainted away;—but being recovered, ſhe was condemned, to, the flames. Her bones were diſlocated in ſuch a manner, that they were forced to carry her in a chair to the place of execution. While ſhe was at the ſtake, letters were brought her from the lord chancellor, offering her the king's pardon if ſhe would recant. But ſhe refuſed to look at them; telling the meſſenger, that "ſhe came not thither to deny her lord and maſter." The ſame letters were alſo tendered to three other perſons, condemned to the ſame fate; and who, animated by her example, refuſed to accept them. Whereupon the lord mayor commanded the fire to be kindled;—and, with ſavage ignorance, cried out <hi>Fiat juſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titia,</hi> Let guſtice take its courſe. The faggots being lighted, ſhe commended her ſoul, with the utmoſt compoſure, into the hands of her Maker; and, like the great founder of the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion ſhe profeſſed expired, <hi>praying for her murderers,</hi> July 16, 1546, about the 25th year of her age.</p>

               <p>ATHELBERT, the laſt king of the Eaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Angels, was of a very amiable temper, a fine perſon and great virtues. The goodneſs of his nature, and the humility of his mind, the regard he ſhewed to religion in his actions, and juſtice in his adminiſtration, rendered him the delight of his people, who wanted noth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:032500_0095_0FF2FBDA76F38140"/>
to complete their happineſs but an heir to ſucceed to the crown in caſe of his deceaſe.—He was young; had been bred to letters, and being fond of books, had not been ſuſceptible of any impreſſion from beauty; perhaps, the reigning paſſion of the age, inclining to celib<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acy, might have contributed, in ſome meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure to his inſenſibility. The univerſal deſire and common good of his people, the diſtraction and convulſions the kingdom would be expoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to for want of an heir, were the topics uſed by the nobility and biſhops, which induced him to call a council to conſider of the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. It being their unanimous opinion that it would be beſt for him to marry; Athelrida, the daughter of Oſſa, king of Mercia, a prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs of great beauty and merit, was immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixed on as a ſuitable match. The young king, not long after ſet out with a ſplendid re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue, accompanied by count Oſwald, the chief of his council, and the perſon who had firſt named the lady to the king. Being arriv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the borders of the Mercian territories, they waited for a ſafe-conduct, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent of the lady's father, who was then keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his court at Hertford. On the recep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of this meſſage a council was held to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider on the manner in which Athelbert ſhould be treated. The courtiers, who eaſily per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the intentions of their monarch, and thinking this a fine opportunity to annex the hingdom of Eaſt-Angles to that of Mercia,
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:032500_0096_0FF2FBDC651CA028"/>
determined to murder Athelbert and ſeize his dominions. The more effectually to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſh this villainous deſign, he was invited with the greateſt ſhew of friendſhip to a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference with Oſſa, under the pretence of ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tling the preliminaries of his marriage; and going thither without any attendants, was ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his way by Guimbert, and privately be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>headed. The young princeſs, ſhocked at her father's perfidious cruelty, ſent the earlieſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of this cataſtrophe to the nobility who waited for the return of the king. Unable to revenge his death, and fearful of the like fate, they immediately mounted their horſes, and made the beſt way to their own country. Athel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bert's corpſe and head were buried at firſt by Offa's order in an obſcure place on the banks of the Lugge, but were afterwards removed to Fernley, ſince called Hertford, the cathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dral of which city is dedicited to his honor.</p>
