            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>INgratitude towards Men, after ſignal Favours received, is amongſt all civilized People, looked upon with a juſt Deteſtation; inſomuch, that the Moral <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in Ages poſt, thought they could give no worſe a Character of a Perſon, than to call him <hi>Ungrateful:</hi> How much more then are <hi>Chriſtians</hi> (eſpecially in a Time of ſuch Light, as now ſhineth) engaged, to ſhun this Sin of <hi>Ingratitude,</hi> towards their God, whom they ſenſibly know, to be <hi>The Fountain of all their Mercies?</hi> And ſurely, next to the infinite Mercy, ſhewed them for Chriſt's ſake, in cauſing the <hi>Day ſpring from on high to viſit their Souls,</hi> remarkable outward Deliverances, ought in a more than commonly remarkable Manner, to be the Objects of Gratitude to their great <hi>Deliverer.</hi> I muſt confeſs, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>hankſgiving (which is what we poor Mortals can return, for the manifold Favours we daily receive from Him) hath its Riſe in the Heart; and as <hi>out of the Abundance of the Heart, the Mouth ſpeaketh;</hi> how can thoſe who are truly thankful in Heart, but <hi>render the Calves of their Lips,</hi> in telling to their Friends and Acquaintance, <hi>How great Things God hath done for them?</hi> Nay, they are ſo affected with ſuch eminent Appearances of the protecting Hand of Providence, for their Help, Preſervation and Deliverance, that they are not willing to confine it to them only, but publiſh it to the World, that the Fame of their GOD may be ſpread from <hi>Sea to Sea,</hi> and from one End of the <hi>Earth to the other.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The following Relation being large, I ſhall endeavour to be ſhort; only, ſome of the Things which ſeem to me moſt remarkable, I would more particularly recommend to the Reader's Obſervation.</p>
            <p n="1">
               <hi>1. The Hearts of all Men are in the Hands of God,</hi> he can turn them as he pleaſes. When theſe <hi>Men-Eaters</hi> Fury was at height, their Knives in one Hand, and the poor Shipwrack'd People's Heads in the other, their Knees upon the others Shoulders, and their Looks diſmal; on a ſudden, the <hi>Savages</hi> were ſtruck dumb, and their Countenances changed, that they looked like another People; the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> (or King) becoming as a Safeguard to the Diſtreſſed, from the Injuries of his own Men: Nay, ſuch Confidence put he in
<pb facs="unknown:006658_0004_10297646B6791568"/>
them, that he would truſt them to remove the Money he had taken from themſelves, before he would truſt his own People. When they were got from there, to another Place, where they expected more Safety, they found themſelves diſappointed, freſh Dangers preſenting themſelves, as diſmally as before; yet God prevented any further Miſchief, than the ſtripping them of thoſe poor Rags the others had left them, and ſome other Abuſes, which by that Time were grown familiar to them, and were looked upon, as <hi>light Afflictions</hi>: The <hi>Caſſekey's</hi> Wife being made an Inſtrument for their Delivery, ſhe, and ſome others, having ſomething of Tenderneſs of Heart in them, tho' amongſt ſuch an <hi>inhuman Crew.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">
               <hi>2.</hi> Many were the particular Diliverances, upon occaſion of Injuries offered: Once, an Arrow ſhot at them narrowly eſcaped them: Another Time, ſome going to ſhoot Arrows at them, certain of their own Company caught hold of their Bows and Arms; nay, though ſome of them ſhot, yet their Arrows miſt. Not to mention the frequent Dangers they were in, upon every ſlight Suſpicion of their being <hi>Engliſh,</hi> of which, more anon. And well might theſe poor Sufferers be in conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual Fear of their Lives, ſince about a Twelve Month before, a Parcel of <hi>Dutch-Men,</hi> who had likewiſe ſuffered Shipwrack, had been killed and devoured; and moreover, of the many Veſſels, ſuppoſed to be loſt on that Coaſt, theſe are the firſt Company that are known to have eſcaped: Neither is it ſo wonderful that they are thus cruel to Strangers, ſince they are unnatural to their own aged People; they having no more Compaſſion on them, than to make them Slaves to the Youn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. Yet are theſe <hi>Men-Eaters</hi> as cowardly as cruel; when the <hi>Spaniards</hi> came up, the Sight of a ruſty Muſket preſented towards them, would make ſeveral of them fly.</p>
            <p n="3">
               <hi>3.</hi> The Dangers they were delivered from, aroſe not only from Men, but the <hi>Elements</hi> alſo, which God permitted to threaten and afflict them. One Time, rowing in their Boat, the Sea ſwelled, ſo that it was dangerous continuing there all Night, and as dangerous, to endeavour for the Shore; yet Providence failed them not, but conducted them ſafe thither, as though there had been a Lane made through the Breakers: Another Time, by Reaſon of a great Flood, they were forced to remove their Lodgings ſeveral Times, and for divers Days, were in a continual Apprehenſion of being drowned, at length were preſerved upon an <hi>Oyſter Hill</hi>: Not to mention the frequent Dangers they were in, by reaſon of the extream Cold, too tedious to touch at here; wherein this however is remarkable, that God can both adminiſter Strength in the Midſt of Weakneſs, and alſo take away Strength, and cauſe Weakneſs to ſeize, whenever he pleaſes: Here was an Old Man, a Woman with a Sucking Child, and another with Child, Perſons ſeemingly very unlikely to encounter ſuch Hardſhips, all eſcaped; and divers <hi>Negroes,</hi> uſed to more Hardineſs, periſhed.</p>
            <p n="4">
               <pb facs="unknown:006658_0005_102976483B18B920"/>
               <hi>4.</hi> As to Lodging, I ſhall ſay little, any diſcreet Perſon may imagine, how hard it was to People, well brought up, to lie on a Floor, ſwarming with Abundance of many Sorts of creeping Things, occaſioned by the throwing the Berry Stones on the Floor, and letting all the Naſtineſs they made, lie there, which bred theſe Vermin; and yet perhaps might be accounted good Lodging, in Compariſon of the cold Ground, whereon they often lay afterwards unſheltered, expoſed to the bleak Blaſts of the rigid <hi>North-Weſt-Wind.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">
               <hi>5.</hi> Their Food moſt ſcanty, the beſt of it ſuch, as (I am ready to think) the meaneſt <hi>Negro</hi> here, would not touch with his Lips: Sometimes the Gills and Guts of Fiſh, pick'd off a Dunghill; ſometimes the Scraps the <hi>Indians</hi> f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

At firſt their Sorrows were ſo great, and their Alarms ſo many, they could not eat; afterwards their Dyet ſo uncouth, they could not away with it; until at length Hunger had ſo far prevailed over them, that they could eat with an Appetite, the <hi>Palmetto-Berries;</hi> the Taſte whereof was once irkſome, and ready to take away their Breath; nay, ſo fond were they of them, that the getting of about a Buſhel accidentally, was looked on a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> a great Prize.</p>
            <p n="6">
               <hi>6.</hi> Their being forced to maſk themſelves, under the Name of <hi>Spaniards,</hi> though few of them could ſpeak any <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> was another Hardſhip; moſtly becauſe the Natives often ſuſpected them to be <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and thereby they were continually in Danger of their Lives: Whether their Cruelty againſt the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> proceeds from their being under no Apprehenſion of Danger from them, and ſo may think themſelves lawleſs, in what they do againſt our Nation; or whether it proceeds from any particular Diſguſt offered them by ſome <hi>Engliſh,</hi> I ſhall not determine: However, it would do well, for thoſe that are not under their Power to avoid giving them any juſt Cauſe of Offence, leaſt their Neighbours ſuffer for their Faults: One of theſe <hi>Savages</hi> could complain, <hi>That, ſome Years paſt, he had been taken off by ſome of our</hi> Engliſh <hi>Sloops, from whom he eſcaped by Swimming,</hi> and was therewith diſguſted, inſomuch, that could he, by his ſifting, have found out, that they were <hi>Engliſh,</hi> it might have proved of ill Conſequence to them.</p>

            <p>One remarkable Paſſage I cannot well omit, which demonſtrates he had well learn'd of Him who is a <hi>God of Truth,</hi> to ſpeak the Truth upon all Occaſions, though with the Hazard of his Life. For, as the Reader may obſerve in the Series of this following Relation, theſe poor People, for the Safe-guard of their Lives, had aſſumed the Name of <hi>Spaniards</hi>; ſome on that Account, aſſerting what was wrong, others concealing the Truth; yet this Honeſt-hearted Man, being directly aſked the Queſtion, <hi>Nickalier, Nickalier?</hi> (their Word for <hi>Engliſh-Men</hi>) could do neither; but in Simplicity anſwered, <hi>Yes;</hi> being aſked ſo concerning another, he again anſwered, <hi>Yes.</hi> Yet though for his Plain-dealing, he was ſtripp'd of his Clothes; which, till then, he
<pb facs="unknown:006658_0007_10297649C593DB40"/>
had ſaved, God ſuffered not theſe <hi>Savages</hi> to touch his Life, or the Lives of any of his Company.</p>
            <p>Thus he paſſed through this afflicting Trial, and at length arrived at this Place, on the <hi>1</hi>ſt Day of the <hi>2</hi>d Month, <hi>1697.</hi> though in much Weakneſs; having been taken very ill of the Belly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ach and Flux at <hi>Auguſtine</hi>; of which he never recovered, but ſtill grew worſe, to his dying Day. It was about the <hi>8</hi>th Hour in the Evening, when the <hi>Veſſel,</hi> he was Paſſenger in, arrived at this Place. Divers Friends went on board, in order to get him a Shore, but he being in a very weak Condition, they could not remove him at that Time. He declared, <hi>His great Satisfaction, that the Lord had granted his Requeſt, that he might lay down his Bones in this Place; that his Heart was ſtrong, and he hoped he might firſt ſee</hi> Friends <hi>again at the Meeting. He made mention of the Goodneſs of God to him, and that his Preſence had attended him in all his Exerciſes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The next Morning, being the <hi>2</hi>d of the <hi>2</hi>d Month, divers Friends went on board, to help the Veſſel up to a Wharf, in order to get him on Shore; in which Time he ſpake as before related, <hi>God's Power attending him.</hi> About the <hi>7</hi>th Hour, divers Friends carried him in a <hi>Hammocker</hi> (being wrapp'd up in a Blanket, and Clothes to keep him warm) to the Houſe of <hi>Samuel Carpenter,</hi> where he declared, <hi>The Goodneſs of God to him; and that his Heart was yet ſtrong, and his Memory and Underſtanding good. After which he was ſhifted, and then ſlept a conſiderable Time.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the ſame Day, ſome Friends coming into the Room to viſit him, at the Sight of them he ſeemed to rejoice; and, putting forth his Hand, was ready to embrace them in much Love, and in a very tender Frame of Spirit. The Friends expreſſed their Gladneſs to ſee him; but ſaid, <hi>They were ſorry to ſee him ſo very weak:</hi> To which he replied, <hi>Although my Body be weak, my Mind is ſound, and Memory good.</hi> And further ſaid, <hi>The Lord hath been very good to me, all along unto this very Day; and this Morning hath ſweetly refreſhed me.</hi> And further added, <hi>The Lord hath anſwered my Deſire, for I deſired Content, and that I might come to this Place, to lay my Bones amongſt you.</hi> And afterwards ſaid, <hi>It is a good Thing to have a Conſcience void of Offence, both towards God, and towards Men.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>On the <hi>4</hi>th Day of the <hi>2</hi>d Month, being the <hi>1</hi>ſt Day of the Week, about the <hi>5</hi>th Hour in the Morning, he deſired a Friend to write for him to his dear Wife, <hi>To remember his dear Love to her: and to let her know of his Travels, and being here; and that the Lord was with him; that his outward Affairs were ſettled; and That ſhe had wherewithall to live on.</hi> He further ſaid, divers Friends being preſent; <hi>That the Lord was with him, and all Things were well; and that he had nothing to do, but to die:</hi> And accordingly on this Day <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And now, having brought my Relation, concerning this good Man, to the laſt Period of his Life, I might very well have put a Period to my <hi>Preface:</hi> But that I foreſee, Some Perſons may be ready to ſay. <hi>Here is an Account of very ſtrange Paſſages, but of what Credit is the Relator? May we depend upon his Authority, without Danger of being Impoſed upon?</hi> To ſuch I anſwer, He is a Man well known in this Town, of good Credit and Repute; on whoſe Fidelity and Veracity, thoſe who have any Knowledge of him, will readily rely without ſuſpecting Fallacy. But <hi>that in the Mouth of two or three Witneſſes every Thing may be eſtabliſhed,</hi> beſides him and his Wife, a Perſon, whoſe Reſidence (when at home) is in this Town, viz. <hi>Joſeph Kirle,</hi> the Maſter of the <hi>Barkentine,</hi> in which they ſuffered Shipwrack, a Man of an honeſt Character amongſt his Neighbours, had the Peruſal of it, before it went to the Preſs; and approved it.

            <p>THE Twenty-third Day of the Sixth Month, called <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1696.

            <p>The 31ſt Day, This Evening we loſt ſight of the <hi>Hamſhire</hi>-Frigat, and then beat to Windward again.</p>
            <p>The 1ſt Day the 7th Month, we Anchored to Weſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of <hi>Savanna La Mar,</hi> and loſt our Anchor.</p>
            <p>The 2d Day, we got into <hi>Blewfields</hi> Road to Water.</p>
            <p>The 4th Day, This Morning we ſailed from <hi>Blew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fields</hi> intending our Paſſage through the <hi>Gulph.</hi>

            <p>The 14th Day, about Noon, were a Breaſt with <hi>Cape Antonia</hi>; and about a League to the Eaſtward off the <hi>Cape</hi> was a Fire with a great Smoak: At length People appeared on the <hi>Bay,</hi> making Signs for us to put on Shore; but having a freſh Gale, and not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing who they were, our Maſter would not.</p>
            <p>The 16th Day made the Table-land of the <hi>Havanna,</hi> and this Evening ſtood over for <hi>Cape Florida</hi>; but about Eight or Nine at Night we ſaw two Lights, being about a Mile from us; we fearing we were got amongſt the French-Fleet, tacked, and ſtood for the <hi>Havanna.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The 18th Day, This Morning no Sail appeared, and being moſt of the Day calm; we lay about Four Leagues off the <hi>Havanna</hi>; we had a fair Wind, and were deſigned for that Port, to enquire of the French-Fleet. This Afternoon came a Turnado from the Land, and our Maſter being on the Quarter-Deck, our Boom gibing knocked him down, and broke his Leg, which Accident was grievious to him and us; but having Things ſuitable, with a little Experience, ſet it. At this Time had I Four of my Family very ſick; one whereof was an <hi>Indian Girl</hi> being juſt as I had bound up the the Maſter's Leg taken with Fitts, whic<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

About Four this After<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noon we eſpyed a Ship, to the Eaſtward of us (we being about Four Leagues off Shore, and about Fifteen Leagues to Eaſtward of the <hi>Havanna</hi>) ſuppoſing her to be a <hi>French-Man,</hi> therefore ſtood in for the Shore; but ſhe gained on us: Then a Turnado ſprang up, and a great Shower of Rain followed, which hid us.

            <p>The 23d Day, About One a Clock in the Morning we felt our Veſſel ſtrike ſome few ſtrokes, and then ſhe Floated again, for five or ſix Minutes, before ſhe ran faſt a Ground, where ſhe beat violently at firſt; the Wind was violent; and it was very dark, that our Marriners could ſee no Land: The Seas broke over us, that we were in a quarter of an Hour Floating in the Cabin: We endeavoured to get a Candle lighted, which in a little Time was accompliſhed. By this Time we felt the Veſſel not to ſtrike ſo often; but ſeveral of her Timbers were broken, and ſome Plank ſtarted; the Seas continued breaking over us, and no Land to be ſeen. We concluded to keep in the Veſſel as long as ſhe would hold together. About the Third Hour this Morning, we ſuppoſed we ſaw Land at ſome conſiderable Diſtance.

               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:006658_0014_10297661824CF188"/>As we were under a deep exerciſe and Concernment, a Notion aroſe from one of us, that if we ſhould put our ſelves under the Denomination of <hi>Spaniards</hi> (it being known that Nation had ſome Influence on them) and one of us, named <hi>Solomon Creſſon,</hi> ſpeaking the <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Language well, it was hop'd this might be a Means for our Delivery; to which, the moſt of the Company aſſented.</p>
            <p>Within two or three Hours after the Departure of the two <hi>Indians,</hi> ſome of our People being near the Beach or Stand, returned and ſaid, the <hi>Indians</hi> were coming in a very great Number, all running and ſhouting: About this Time the Storm was much aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, the Rain ceaſed, and the Sun appeared, which had been hid from us ſeveral Days. The <hi>Indians</hi> went all to the Veſſel, caſting forth what ever they could lay hold on, except Rum, Sugar, Molaſſes, Beef and Pork.</p>
            <p>But their <hi>Caſſekey</hi> (for ſo they call their King) with about thirty more, came down to us in a furious man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, having a diſmal Aſpect, and foaming at the Mouth; their Weapons were large <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Knives, except their <hi>Caſſekey's,</hi> who had a Baggonet, that belonged to the Maſter of our Veſſel: They ruſhed in upon us, and cried, <hi>Nickaleer, Nickaleer</hi>; we underſtood them not at firſt; they repeating it unto us often, at laſt they cryed <hi>Epania</hi> for <hi>Spaniards</hi>; by which we underſtood them, that at firſt they meant <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but they were anſwered to the latter in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> yea; to which they replyed.

            <p>Whilſt we were thus ſitting, as a People almoſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concerned, theſe bloody minded Creatures placed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves each behind one, kicking and throwing away the

Buſhes that were nigh, or under their Feet; the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> had placed himſelf behind me, ſtanding on the Cheſt which I ſat upon; they all having their Arms extended, with their Knives in their Hands, ready to execute their bloody Deſign, ſome taking hold of ſome of us by the Heads, with their Knees ſet againſt our Shoulders: In this Poſture they ſeem'd to wait for the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> to begin: They were high in Words, which we underſtood not: But on a ſudden, it pleaſed the Lord to work wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully for our Preſervation, and inſtantly all theſe Savage-Men were ſtruck Dumb, and like Men amazed the Space of a quarter of an Hour, in which Time their Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenances fell, and they looked like another People: They quitted their Places they had taken behind us, and came in amongſt us, requiring to have all our Cheſts, Trunks and Boxes unlock'd, which being done, they divided all that was in them. Our Money the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> took unto himſelf, privately hiding it in the Buſhes: Then they went to pulling off our Clothes, leaving each of us on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a pair of Breeches, or an old Coat, except my Wife and Child, <hi>Robert Barrow,</hi> and our Maſter, from whom they took but little this Day.</p>
            <p>Having thus done, they asked us again. <hi>Nickaleer, Nickaleer?</hi> But we anſwered, by ſaying, <hi>Pennſylvania.</hi>

            <p>We gave them to underſtand, that we came that Way. and were for the Northward: All which took Place with them. We perceived, that the <hi>Caſſekey's</hi> Heart was tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed towards us; for he kept moſtly with us, and would the remaining Part of this Day keep off the Petty-Robbers, which would have had our few Rags from us. Some Time before Night we had a Shower of Rain, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> made Signs for us to build ſome Shelter; upon which we got our Tent up, and ſome Leaves to lye upon.</p>
            <p>About this Time our Veſſel lay dry on Shore, and the <hi>Indians</hi> gathered themſelves together, Men and Woman, ſome Hundreds in Number. Having got all the Goods out of the Veſſel, and covered the <hi>Bay</hi> for a large Diſtance, opened all the Stuffs and Linnen, and ſpread them to dry. They would touch no Sort of ſtrong Drink, Sugar, nor Molaſſes, but left it in the Veſſel. They ſhouted, and made a great Noiſes in the Time of Plunder. Night coming on, the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> put thoſe Cheſts and Trunks, which he had reſerved for himſelf, into our Tent; which pleaſed us, and gave an Expectation of his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany; for he was now become a Defender of us from the Rage of others. The <hi>Caſſekey</hi> went down to the Water-Side, amongſt his People, and returned with three old Coats that were wet and torn; which he gave us; one whereof I had. We made a Fire at each End of our Tent, and laid our ſelves down, it being dark: But hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing hideous Noiſes, and fearing that they were not ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, we expected them upon us. The chief <hi>Indian</hi> (or <hi>Caſſekey</hi>) lay in the Tent upon his Cheſts. And about Mid-night, we heard a Company of <hi>Indians</hi> coming from the Veſſel towards us, making terrible Shouts, and coming fiercely up to the Tent; the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> called to them, which cauſed them to ſtand: It ſeemed they had killed a Hog, and brought him; ſo the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> asked us, if we would eat the Hog? <hi>Solomon Creſſon,</hi> by our deſire
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:006658_0017_10297667CCD7BC28"/>
anſwered him, That we uſed not to eat at that Time of the Night: Whereupon they threw the Hog down before the Tent, and the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> ſent them away. They went ſhouting to the Sea-Shore, where there were ſome Hundreds of them, Revelling about our Wreck.</p>

               <p>This Morning, having purpoſed to endeavour for Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to paſs to the Northward, <hi>Solomon</hi> opened the Matter to the <hi>Caſſekey</hi>; who anſwered, we muſt go to his Town to the South-ward.</p>
               <p>This occaſioned us to go for <hi>Santa Lucea</hi> (this Place hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Name, ſuppoſed to have found it under the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment of that <hi>Nation,</hi> whence we might expect Relief) But the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> told us, That it was about two or three Days Joueney thither; and that, when we came there, we ſhould have our Throats and Scalps cut; and be Shot, burn'd and Eaten. We thought that Information was but to divert us, ſo that we were more earneſt to go; but he ſternly denied us, ſaying, We muſt go to his Town.</p>
               <p>About Eight a Clock this Morning, the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> came into our Tent, and ſet himſelf amongſt us, asking the old Queſtion, <hi>Nickaleer, Nickaleer?</hi> Directing his Speech to one particular of us, who in Simplicity anſwered, <hi>Yes.</hi> Which cauſed the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> to ask in the ſaid Perſon, if another Perſon, which he pointed to was <hi>Nickaleer</hi>?

Thus were we left almoſt Naked, till the Feud was ſomething abat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and then we got ſome-what from them, which diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed ſome of them. We then cut our Tents in Pieces, and got the moſt of our Clothing out of it; which the <hi>Indians</hi> perceiving, took the Remains from us. We Men had moſt of us Breeches, and Pieces of Canvas; and all the Company interceded for my Wife, ſo that all was

not taken from her. About Noon, the <hi>Indians</hi> having removed all their Plunder off the <hi>Bay,</hi> and many of them gone; a Guard was provided, arm'd with Bows and Arrows, with whom we were ſummoned to march; and a Burden provided for every one to carry, that was any ways able. Our Maſter, with his broken Leg, was help'd along by his Negro <hi>Ben.</hi> My Wife was forced to carry her Child, they not ſuffering any of us to relieve her. But if any of us offered to lay down our Burden, we were threatened to be ſhot. Thus were we forced along the <hi>Beach</hi> bare-footed.</p>
               <p>We had ſaved one of the <hi>Maſter's Quadrants,</hi> and <hi>Sed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Calender,</hi> with two other Books. As we walked along the <hi>Bay</hi> (the Time ſuiting) our Mate, <hi>Richard Limpeney,</hi> took an Obſervation, and we found our ſelves to be in the Latitude of twenty ſeven Degrees and eight Minutes: Some of the <hi>Indians</hi> were offended at it; when he held up his Quadrant to obſerve, one would draw an Arrow to ſhoot him; but it pleaſed God hitherto to prevent them from ſhedding any of our Blood.</p>
               <p>One Paſſage I have omitted: Two of our <hi>Marriners,</hi> named <hi>Thomas Fowns</hi> and <hi>Richard Limpany,</hi> went forth this Morning, from our Tent, down to the <hi>Bay</hi> where the <hi>Indians</hi> were, and viewing of them at ſome Diſtance, an <hi>Indian-Man</hi> came runing upon them, with his Knife in his Hand took hold of <hi>Thomas Fowns</hi> to ſtab him; but the ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> fell on his Knees, uſing a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Ceremony, and begged not to kill him, whereupon the <hi>Indian</hi> deſiſted, and bid him be gone to the Place from whence he came. The ſaid <hi>Thomas</hi> at his Return, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted us how narrowly he had eſcaped.</p>
               <p>After we had travelled about five Miles along the deep Sand, the Sun being extream hot, we came to an Inlet: On the other ſide was the <hi>Indian-Town,</hi> being little <hi>Wigwams,</hi> made of ſmall Poles ſtuck in the Ground, which they bended one to another, making an Arch, and covered them with Thatch of ſmall <hi>Palmetto</hi> Leaves: Here we were commanded to ſit down, and the <hi>Caſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key</hi>

came to us, who with his Hand, ſcratched a Hole in the Sand, about a Foot deep, and came to Water, which he made Signs for us to come and Drink, we being extream Thirſty, did, but the Water was almoſt Salt: Whilſt we ſat here, we ſaw great Fires making on the other Side of the Inlet, which ſome of us thought was preparing for us. After an Hours Time being ſpent here, at length came an <hi>Indian</hi> with a ſmall <hi>Cannoo</hi> from the other Side, and I, with my Wife and Child, and <hi>Robert Barrow,</hi> were ordered to go in; the ſame <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noo</hi> was but juſt wide enough for us to ſit down in; over we were carried, and being landed, the Man made Signs for us to walk to <hi>Wigwams,</hi> which we did; but the young <hi>Indians</hi> would ſeem to be frightned, and fly from us. We were directed to a <hi>Wigwam,</hi> which, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards we underſtood to be the <hi>Caſſekey's</hi>: It was a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout a Man's height to the Top; herein was the <hi>Caſſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>key's</hi> Wife, and ſome old Women, ſitting on a Cabbin, made of Sticks, about a Foot high, covered with a Mat, they made Signs for us to ſit down on the Ground, which we did: The <hi>Caſſekey's</hi> Wife having a young Child ſucking at her Breaſt, gave it to another Woman, and would have my Child, which my Wife was very loath to ſuffer; but ſhe would not be denyed, took our Child and ſuckled it at her Breaſt, viewing and feeling it from Top to Toe, at length returned it to my Wife; and by this Time was another Parcel of our People come over; and ſitting down by the <hi>Wigwam</hi> Side, our <hi>Indian</hi> brought a Fiſh boiled, on a <hi>Palmetto</hi> Leaf, and ſet it down amongſt us, making Signs for us to Eat; but our Exerciſe was too great for us to have any Inclination to receive Food; at length our People were brought over, and afterwards came the <hi>Caſſekey</hi>: As ſoon as he came to his <hi>Wigwam,</hi> he ſet himſelf to work, got ſome ſtakes, and ſtuck them in a row, joyning to his <hi>Wigwam,</hi> and tyed ſome Sticks, whereon were theſe ſmall <hi>Palmettos,</hi> tyed and faſtned them to the ſtakes, about three Foot high, and layed two or three Mats made of Reeds down by his Shelter; which,

it ſeems, he made for us, to break the Wind off us, and ordered us to lye down there, which we did, as many as the Mats would hold, the reſt lay on the Ground by us; the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> went into his <hi>Wigwam,</hi> and ſeated himſelf on his Cabin croſs-legged; having a Basket of <hi>Palmetto Berries</hi> brought him, which he eat very greedily; after which, came ſome <hi>Indians</hi> unto him, and talk'd much; Night come on; the Moon being up, an <hi>Indian,</hi> who performeth their Ceremonies, ſtood out, looking full at the Moon, making a hideous Noiſe, and crying out, act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like a Mad-man for the Space of half an Hour, all the <hi>Indians</hi> being ſilent till he had done; after which, they all made a fearful Noiſe, ſome like the Barking of a Dogg, or Wolf, and other ſtrange Sounds: After this, one gets a Logg, and ſets himſelf down, holding the ſtick of Logg upright on the Ground, and ſeveral others getting about him, made a hideous Noiſe, ſinging to our Amazement; at length their Women joyned Concort, making the Noiſe more terrible, this they continued till Midnight. Towards Morning was great Dews: Our Fire being expended, we were extream cold.</p>
               <p>This Morning the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> looking on us with a mild Aſpect, ſent his Son with a ſtriking Staff to the Inlet, to ſtrike Fiſh for us, which was performed with great Dexterity, for ſome of us walked down with him, and though we looked very earneſtly when he threw <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Sometimes he would run ſwiftly purſuing a Fiſh, and ſeldom miſt when he darted at him. In two Hours Time he got as many Fiſh as would ſerve twenty Men: There were others alſo Fiſhing at the ſame Time, ſo that Fiſh was plenty; but the ſenſe of our Conditions, ſtayed our hungry Stomachs, for ſome amongſt us thought they would feed us, to feed themſelves.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Caſſekey</hi> went this Morning towards our Veſſel in his abſence the other <hi>Indians</hi> looked very untowardly upon us, which created a Jealouſie of their Cruelty yet to come.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:006658_0021_10293C6B21368C58"/>
This Afternoon we ſaw a great Fire nigh the Place of our Veſſel; whereupon we concluded, that our Veſſel and our Boat were Burn'd: Whereupon we were almoſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmed that they deſigned to deſtroy us. About Sun-ſetting the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> came home; we ſpake to him, he anſwered us, and ſeemed very affable, which we liked well: Night drawing on, and the Wind ſhifting North<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward, we removed our Shelter, and added the Mats to it to break the Wind off us, which blowed cold, and laid our ſelves on the Sand. About an Hour within Night came a parcel of <hi>Indians</hi> from the Southward, being all arm'd with <hi>Bow</hi> and <hi>Arrows,</hi> and coming near our Tent, ſome of us eſpyed them, whereupon they ſquatted down: This ſeemed a freſh Token of Danger, and we awaked thoſe of us that where fallen a ſleep, and bid them prepare, for things ſeemed dangerous, we ſuppoſing they were come to forward our Deſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, or to carry us to the Southward; they ſat thus a conſiderable Time; at length they diſtributed themſelves to the <hi>Wigwam:</hi> Thus would Danger often appear un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us, and almoſt ſwallow us up; but at Times we ſhould be ſet over it, having a ſecret Hope, that God would work our Deliverance, having preſerved us in ſo many Perils.</p>

Our Negroes told us, they went up the Sound with the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> and landed near the Place where our Tent had been: The chief Buſineſs was, to remove the Money from one Place to another, and bury it. This old Man would truſt our People, but not his own. After that was done, they went to the Place where our Veſſel was burn'd: They lanched our Boat, in which the old <hi>Caſſekey</hi> put his Cheſts, wherein was our Linnen, and other of our Things. Alſo they got a ſmall Runlet, which they filled with Wine out of a Quarter-Cask that was left; and brought Sugar out of the Wreck, which was not conſumed with the Fire. By this Time came the <hi>Caſſekey,</hi> and other Negro, in the Cannoo. He told us, on the Morrow we ſhould go with our Boat: This was chearful News unto us. All the Time ſome <hi>Indians</hi> had been out, and brought home ſome <hi>Oyſters</hi>; and the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> gave us ſome, bidding us, take what we had Mind to. A little before Night, the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> opened his Cheſt and and Boxes: And his Wife came, and took what was in them from him. But he ſeem'd very generous to my Wife and Child, and gave her ſeveral Things which were uſeful to her and our Child.</p>
               <p>Our Boat was very Leaky, ſo that we got her into a Creek to ſink her, that the Water might ſwell her.</p>

               <p>The <hi>Caſſekey,</hi> and ſome other <hi>Indians,</hi> went with our People towards our Wreck, we rowing along Shore, and our Boat very leaky, that one Perſon had employ enough to heave out the Water.</p>

they would be ever and anon ſnatching one thing or other<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at which time our People would point to us in the Boat; but perceiving they could not get us aſhore, in ſome few Hours left them.</p>
               <p>This Day at Noon, <hi>Joſeph Kirle</hi> having his Quadrant and Calendar, took an Obſervation, being in the Latitude of 27 Deg. 45 Min.

They got ſome Water and ſet forward again; the two <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians</hi> ſtill followed them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> About this Time we ſaw a Sail to the Eaſtward, and we ſuppoſing it at firſt to be a <hi>Brigantius,</hi> agreed to follow her; but in a ſmall Time, we made it to be a Cannoo or Boat, with two Maſts and Sail: She ſtood in for the Shore, but as ſoon as they eſpyed us, ſhe bore away; and when ſhe ſaw we made not after her, ſhe ſtood aſhore again for the <hi>Indian-Town</hi>; hereupon a Jealouſie got amongſt us, that ſhe might go on Shore, and get ſtrong with Men, and come after us, whereupon we rowed very hard, and kept an offing for ſome Hours; but finding they came not out, we ſtood towards the Shore again. This Day was extream hot, and we had no Water ſince we left the <hi>Indian-Town,</hi> to the Southward of our Wreck, called by the Name of <hi>Hoe-Bay,</hi> therefore we were deſirous to get on Shore; but when we endeavoured it we could not, for the Seas ſwelled very much, and came rowling from the Eaſtward, ſo that the Seas run very hollow, and broke almoſt a Mile from the Shore; our Maſter ſaid, <hi>It was impoſſible to get on ſhore alive</hi>: But I being under ſome Exerciſe, was deſirous to be on Shore, and thereupon did expreſs my ſelf to the reſt of our People, they ſtarted

the Danger, all which I was as ſenſible of as they; yet I could not reſt, but inſiſted on going a ſhore: The Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and Men ſaid, <hi>We ſhould not ſave our lives:</hi> But I gained ſo far, that they attempted, and were got with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in half a Mile of a ſhore; but the Seas came on us ſo large and hollow, that one Sea had like to have overwhelmed us, we juſt got a Top of it, before it broke; there was then no perſwading them to go further, but we ſtood off, and deſigned to keep off all Night, our People being very weary, and the Sun ſetting, we divided one half to get ſome Sleep, the other to watch, and keep the Boat's head to the Sea. The weather looked as though it would be bad, and the Sea increaſed, whereupon I began a-freſh to perſwade them to go on ſhore; all were deſirous, but thought it impoſſible; at length we reſolved to venture, and ſo committing our ſelves to the Protection of the Almighty God, We ſtood in for the ſhore, and made Signs to our People that we deſigned it. And it pleaſed God to order it ſo, that we went on ſhore, as though there had been a Lane made through the Breakers, and were carried to the Top of the Bank, where we got aged <hi>Robert Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row,</hi> my Wife and Child out of the Boat, before ever a Sea came to fill us; which it did, as ſoon as they were got out: But we got our Boat up from the waſh of the Sea.</p>
               <p>The two <hi>Indians</hi> were for taking off our Clothes, (which would not cover our Bodies) but we not being willing to yield, they would ſnatch a piece from one, and a bit from another, and run away with that, and than come again and do the like. Theſe two <hi>Indians</hi> took away what was given to my Wife and Child, which we knew not how to help, but exerciſed Patience.</p>
               <p>We enquired how far it was from <hi>St. Lucia</hi> (one of them ſpeaking a little <hi>Spaniſh</hi>) and by Signs we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood it was not far. They made Signs that when we came there, we ſhould be put to moſt cruel Death, but we hoped otherwiſe.</p>

our People ſaid, before it was dark, they ſaw two or three Houſes which looked white, as tho' they were plaiſtered with Lime, which put us in hopes that there were <hi>Spaniards</hi> there; ſo we ſet forwards, as the <hi>Indians</hi> directed, for <hi>St. Lucia</hi>; they made Signs that we ſhould come to an Inlet of the Sea, and on the other ſide was <hi>St. Lucia.</hi> We travelled about four Miles, and came to an Inlet, but ſaw no Settlement on the other ſide, ſo we concluded to lye there all night: We ſaw the tract of a large <hi>Bear,</hi> and other wild <hi>Beaſts</hi> whereupon we ſet to work to get Wood, and then a Fire: Abundance of <hi>Muskit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toes</hi> and <hi>Sand-flyes</hi> hindred our Reſt; to Remedy which, we digged holes in the Sand, got ſome Graſs, and laid it therein to lye upon, in order to cover ourſelves from the Flyes, which moſt of us did; but it being extream Cold, and Firing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               <p>About Mid-night we ſent our People to ſee if they could get off our Boat, and bring it into the <hi>Inlet</hi> that we might get over to the other ſide: They went and Launched her but the Sea was ſo rough, that there was no poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of getting her off; for ſhe was ſoon filled, and they put to ſwim; and they, Boat and all, were driven on Shore again.</p>

We, perceiving they were ſhy of us, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to doubt of their Amity, which we had ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended on; whereupon we counſelled our People how to deport themſelves, eſpecially our <hi>Negroes.</hi> About Sun-riſing we ſaw the <hi>Indians</hi> coming, running in a very great Number, with their <hi>Bows</hi> and <hi>Arrows,</hi> to the Inlet; where, having five or ſix <hi>Cannoos,</hi> they got into them, as many as thoſe <hi>Cannoos</hi> could hold; others took the Water, and ſwam over unto us: They came in the greateſt Rage that poſſibly a Barbarous People could. <hi>Solomon</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gan to ſpeak <hi>Spaniſh</hi> to them; but they anſwered not till they came a Shore, ſome diſtance from us; and then coming running upon us, they cryed out, <hi>Nickaleer, Nicka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leer?</hi> We ſat all ſtill, expecting Death, and that in a moſt barbarous Manner They that did ſpeak unto them could not be heard: But they ruſhed violently on us, rending and tearing thoſe few Clothes we had; they that had Breeches had ſo many about them, that they hardly touched the Ground, till they were ſhaken out of them; they tore all from my Wife; and eſpying her Hair-Lace, ſome were going to cut the Hair, away to get it; but, like greedy Dogs, another ſnatched and tore it off. As for our poor young <hi>Child,</hi> they ſnatched from it what little it had, as though they would have ſhaken and torn it, Limb from Limb. After they had taken all from us but our Lives, they began to talk one to another, vehe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mently Foaming at the Mouth, like wild <hi>Boars,</hi> and taking their <hi>Bows</hi> and <hi>Arrows,</hi> with other <hi>Weapons,</hi> cryed out, <hi>Nickaleer, Nickaleer, Solomon</hi> ſpake in <hi>Spaniſh</hi> to them, and ſaid, We were <hi>Spaniards</hi>: But they would not hear him, and continued crying out <hi>Nickaleer, Nickaleer</hi>; withal drawing their <hi>Arrows</hi> to the Head. But ſuddenly we per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived them to look about and liſten, and then deſiſted to proſecute their bloody Deſign. One of them took a pair of Breeches, and gave it to my Wife. We brought our great Bible, and a large <hi>Book</hi> of <hi>Robert Barclay's,</hi> to this Place. And being all ſtripped as Naked as we were

born, and endeavouring to hide our Nakedneſs, theſe <hi>Canibals</hi> took the <hi>Books,</hi> and tearing out the Leaves, would give each of us a Leaf to cover us; which we took from them: At which Time they would deride and ſmite us, and inſtantly another of them would ſnatch a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way what the other gave us, ſmiting and deriding us withal.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Robert Barrow,</hi> with my ſelf, Wife and Child, were ordered to go into a <hi>Cannoo,</hi> to be carried to the other Side of the <hi>Inlet,</hi> being a Furlong over; four <hi>Indians</hi> being in the <hi>Cannoo</hi> to paddle: When we came to the other Side, within a <hi>Cannoo's</hi> length of two of the Shore, a Number of <hi>Indians,</hi> with their <hi>Bows</hi> and <hi>Arrows,</hi> came running into the Water, ſome to their Knees, ſome deeper, having their <hi>Bows</hi> and <hi>Arrows</hi> drawn up, crying out, <hi>Nickaleer, Nickaleer</hi>; which they continued without ceaſing. The <hi>Indians</hi> that brought us over leap'd out of the <hi>Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noo,</hi> and ſwam a Shore, fearing they ſhould be ſhot. But in this Juncture it pleaſed God to tender the Hearts of ſome of them towards us, eſpecially the <hi>Caſſekey's</hi> Wife, and ſome of the chiefeſt amongſt them, who were made In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments to intercede for us, and ſtop the Rage of the Multitude, who ſeem'd not to be ſatisfy'd without our Blood.

But the Rage of ſome was ſtill great, thirſting to ſhed our Blood; and a mighty Strife there was amongſt them; ſome would kill us, others would prevent it: And thus one <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian</hi> was ſtriving with another. All being got over, were to walk along the Sea-Shore to their Town. In this Paſſage we, moſt of us, felt the Rage of ſome of them, either by ſtriking or ſtoning; and divers <hi>Arrows</hi> were ſhot: But thoſe that were for Preſerving us, would watch thoſe that were for deſtroying us: And when ſome of them
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:006658_0031_10297695CF58F098"/>
would go to ſhoot, others of them would catch hold of their Bows or Arms. It was ſo ordered, that not one of us was touched with their Arrows; ſeveral of us were knock'd down, and ſome tumbled into the Sea; we dared not help one another, but help we had by ſome of them, being made inſtrumental to help us. My Wife received ſeveral Blows; and an <hi>Indian</hi> came and took hold of her Hair, and was going either to cut her Throat, or ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing like it, having his Knife nigh her Throat; but I looked at him, making a ſign that he ſhould not; ſo he deſiſted. At which Time another <hi>Indian</hi> came, with a handful of Sea-Sand, and filled our poor Child's Mouth. By this Time the <hi>Caſſekey's</hi> Wife, came to my Wife, ſeeing her op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed, and they pulled the Sand out of our Child's Mouth, and kept by my Wife untill we got into the <hi>Caſſakey's</hi> Houſe, which was about Forty <hi>Foot</hi> long, and Twenty-five <hi>Foot</hi> wide, covered with <hi>Palmetto</hi> Leaves both Top and ſides. There was a Range of Cabbins, or a <hi>Barbecue,</hi> on one ſide and two Ends: At the entering on one Side of the Houſe, a Paſſage was made of Benches on each Side, lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the Cabbins. On theſe Benches ſat the chief <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> and at the upper End of the Cabbin was the <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſekey</hi> ſeated.

In a little Time ſome raw <hi>Deer-Skins</hi> were brought in, and given to my Wife, and Negro-Women; and to us Men ſuch as the <hi>Indians</hi> wear, being a Piece of Platt-work of a kind of Silk-Graſs wrought of divers Colours, and of a trian<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular Figure, with a Belt of four Fingers broad of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

The <hi>Indians</hi> were ſeated, as aforeſaid, the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> at the up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per End of them; and the Range of Cabbins was fill'd with Men, Women and Children, beholding us: At length we heard a Women or two cry, according to their Manner, and that very ſorrowfully, one of which I took to be the <hi>Caſſekey's</hi> Wife, which occaſioned ſome of us to think, that ſomething extraordinary was to be done to us. We heard a ſtrange Sort of a Noiſe, which was not like the Noiſe made by a Man, but we could not underſtand what, nor where it was; for ſometimes it ſounded to be in one Part of the Houſe, ſometimes in another, to which we had an Ear: And indeed our Ears and Eyes could perceive or hear nothing, but what was Strange and Diſmal, and Death ſeem'd to ſorround us; but Time diſcovered this Noiſe unto us. The Occaſion of it was thus: In one Part of this Houſe where the Fire was kept, was an <hi>Indian</hi> Man, having a Pot on the Fire, wherein he was making a Drink, of the Leaves of a Shrub (which we underſtood afterwards by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> is called <hi>Caſſeena</hi>) boyling the ſaid Leaves, after they had parched them in a Pot; then with a Gourd, having a long Neck, and at the Top of it a ſmall Hole, which the Top of one's Fin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger could cover, and at the Side of it a round Hole of two Inches Diameter; they take the Liquor out of the Pot, and put it into a deep <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="25" facs="unknown:006658_0033_1029769BDE6718A8"/>
they brew the Liquor, and make it froth very much; it looketh of a deep brown Colour. In the Brewing of this Liquor was this Noiſe made, which we thought ſtrange; for the preſſing of this Gourd gently down into the Liquor, and the Air which is contained, being forced out of the little hole at Top, occaſioned a Sound, which according to the Time and motion given, would be various. This Drink, when made, and cool to Sup, was in a Conck-Shell, firſt carried to the <hi>Caſſekey,</hi> who threw Part of it on the Ground, and the reſt he drank up, and then would make a loud H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>About Noon was ſome Fiſh brought us on ſmall <hi>Pal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>metto</hi> Leaves, being boiled with Scales, Heads and Gills, and nothing taken from them but the Guts, but our Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles and Exerciſe were ſuch, that we cared not for Food.</p>
               <p>In the Evening, we being laid on the Place aforeſaid, the <hi>Indians</hi> made a Drum of a Skin, covering therewith the deep Bowl, in which they brewed their Drink, beating thereon with a Stick, and having a couple of Rattles, made of ſmall Gourds put on Sticks with ſmall Stones in, ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, they began to ſet up a moſt hideous howling, very irkſome to us, and ſometime after came ſome of their Young Women, ſome Singing, ſome Dancing. This was contined till Mid-night, after which they went to Sleep.</p>

The <hi>Indian</hi> Women would take our Child and Suckle it, for its Mother's Milk was almoſt gone, that it could not get a Meal: And our Child, which had been at Death's

               <p>About the tenth Hour, we obſerved the <hi>Indians</hi> to be on a ſudden Motion; moſt of the Principal of them be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>took themſelves to their Houſes; the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> went to Dreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Head, and Painting himſelf, and ſo did all the reſt: When they had done, they came into the <hi>Caſſekey's</hi> Houſe, and ſeated themſelves in Order: In a ſmall Time after came an <hi>Indian</hi> with ſome Attendance into the Houſe, making a Ceremonious Motion, and ſeated himſelf by the <hi>Caſſekey,</hi> the Perſons that came with him ſeated themſelves amongſt the others: After ſome ſmall pauſe, the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> began a Diſcourſe, which held nigh an Hour; After which the Strange <hi>Indian</hi> and his Companions went forth to the Water-Side, unto their <hi>Cannoo,</hi> lying in the Sound, and returned preſently with ſuch Preſents as they had brought, delivering them unto the <hi>Caſſekey,</hi> and thoſe ſitting by giving an Applauſe. The Preſents were ſome few Bunches of the Herb they make their Drink of, and another Herb which they uſe inſtead of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and ſome platted Balls, ſtuffed with Moſs, to lay their Heads on, inſtead of Pillows: The Ceremony being ended, they all ſeated themſelves again, and went to Drinking <hi>Caſſeena,</hi> Smoaking and Talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, during the Strangers ſtay.</p>
               <p>About Noon ſome Fiſh was brought us; Hunger was grown ſtronger upon us, and the Quaintity given was not much more than each a Mouthful, which we Eat; The <hi>Caſſekey</hi> ordered the Maſter, <hi>Joſeph Kirle, Solomon Creſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon,</hi> my Wife and me, to ſit upon their Cabin to eat our Fiſh; and they gave us ſome of their Berries to Eat: We taſted them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but not one amongſt us could ſuffer them to ſtay in our Mouths, for we could compare the taſte of them to nothing elſe, but rotten Cheeſe ſteep'd with <hi>Tobacco.</hi> Sometime after we had eaten, ſome of the <hi>Indian,</hi> asked us, If we were <hi>Spaniards?

               </p>
               <p>About the third Hour in the Afternoon, the Strangers went away, and ſome ſmall Time after, they having ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied themſelves that moſt of us were <hi>Spaniards,</hi> told us that we ſhould be ſent for to the next Town; and they told us that there was a <hi>Nickaleer</hi> off, and we underſtood them [<hi>Engliſh Men of</hi> Briſtol] alſo the Number of ſix Men and a Woman; and that they were to be put to Death before we ſhould get thither.

               <p>About the tenth or twelfth Hour in the Night, before the Singing and Dancing was ended, came in a Stranger armed with Bow and Arrows; the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> and his Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions entertained him with half an Hours Diſcourſe, which ended, we were on a ſudden ordered to get up, and hurried away with this Stranger, they not giving us Time to ſee if we were altogether, and a Troop of young <hi>Indian-Men</hi> and Boys followed us for about four Miles, all which way they pelted us with Stones: At length they all left us except two and our Guide; but we miſſed <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lomon Creſſon</hi> and <hi>Joſeph Kirle's</hi> Boy, and Negro <hi>Ben,</hi> which was no ſmall Trouble to us.

               <p>After Sun-riſing, we came up with the Wreck of the Veſſel that we heard was caſt away. She was Staved all to Piece; for her <hi>Keelſon</hi> was driven a Shore. We ſaw <hi>Suger-Hogſheads, Ginger</hi> and <hi>Logwood,</hi> which gave us to ſuppoſe, that it was one of our Fleet; and we thought it to be either <hi>Borroughs</hi> or <hi>Smith,</hi> belonging to <hi>Briſtol.</hi> A Mile or more from hence we came to an <hi>Inlet</hi>; our Guide told us, we muſt ſwim over, except my <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Robert Barrow</hi>; but we ſignified that we could not: He carried <hi>Robert Barrow, Joſeph Kirle, Me,</hi> my <hi>Wife</hi> and Child, over firſt; and at length the whole Company: For it was a great way over. By that Time we were all over; the Day was hot, and my Wife quite tired and faint; as alſo <hi>Robert Barrow,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph Kirle,</hi> whoſe Leg was grown ſo painful, that it overcame him. We got under a Grape-Buſh for ſhelter from the Sun; I ſent one of my <hi>Negroes</hi> to ſeek for Water for them, but there was none to be had; but he got ſome Seaſide Grapes; which, with reſting, refreſh'd the Weak and Lame.</p>
               <p>Our Guide was for forcing us forward; ſo we travel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led about four or five Miles further, and met with the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> of this Town, and <hi>Commander</hi> of the Northern Part of this Coaſt.

But he would ſhake his Head, and point to the Southward, ſaying, <hi>Nickaleer</hi> no <hi>Comerade (Engliſhmen</hi> were not his <hi>Friends</hi>) Which Words were unpleaſant to us. This People kept us Company till we came within a Mile or two of their Town, and then they left us; they, going faſter, got in before us. Their Town ſtood about half a Mile from the Sea-Shore, within the Land, on the Sound, being ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rounded with a <hi>Swamp,</hi> in which grew <hi>white Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grove-Trees,</hi> which hid the <hi>Town</hi> from the Sea.

They were caſt away the ſame Night we were, and their Veſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel being forced by the Storm, (they not being able for two Days before to carry any Sail) on Shore; they got into their Boat, and ſo on Shore: And in a ſmall Time was a great Part of their Wreck driven on Shore; amongſt which was a Barrel or more of Water, ſome Barrels of Beef or Pork, with their Cheſts, and many other Things which they got. On the Morrow they deſigned to travel to the Northward: But <hi>Andrew Barnes,</hi> their Mate, having been along Time afflicted with a Flux, which had waſted his Body to Skin and Bone, ſo that he was not able to help himſelf, they left him, and travelled a Mile or more, and came to the Inlet, which they could not paſs: Whereupon they returned back again, to take their Boat; but at their Return, before they could get away with their Boat, they eſpyed the <hi>Indians</hi> coming on them, who ſoon got to them; asked in <hi>Spaniſh,</hi> What Nation they were?

Berries to the Time of our coming? <hi>John Smith</hi> and <hi>Andrew Murray</hi> had their Being in the <hi>Caſſekey's</hi> Houſe, and the Woman, named <hi>Penelope</hi>: The reſt of <hi>Smith</hi>'s People lodged in other <hi>Indian-Houſes.</hi> But on our coming, the old <hi>Caſſekey</hi> told them, They muſt turn out, and make Room for the <hi>Spaniards</hi>: But <hi>Smith</hi> and <hi>Murray</hi> would not go; and the <hi>Indian</hi> did not force them out. In ſome Time after we had been in the Houſe, came in an <hi>Indian-Woman,</hi> loaden with Baſkets of Berries, moſtly of the <hi>Palm</hi>; ſome Sea-Side <hi>Coco-Plumbs,</hi> and Sea-Side Grapes. Of the two latter we could eat, but of the Palm Berries we could not bear the Taſte in our Mouths. We laid our ſelves on the <hi>Cabin,</hi> on that Part which was appointed us; on the other Part, the young <hi>Caſſekey</hi> or <hi>King,</hi> lay; being parted by a Cheſt that ſtood thereon. Before Night was a Parcel of large Fiſh, called Drumms, brought in; the old <hi>Caſſekey</hi> told <hi>Joſeph Kirle,</hi> That thoſe were for the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and bid him let ſome-body dreſs them: He alſo ordered us a Pot. They were ſoon dreſs'd, and we eat them. Night being come, the old <hi>Caſſekey</hi> enquired after our Loſſes; which we, as well as we could, gave him to underſtand, that in our Veſſel was a great deal of Clothing and Money, which the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Hoebay</hi> had taken from us! He underſtood ſo much of the Matter, that he grew covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſaid, he would go and get ſome of it from them.</p>
               <p>About Midnight came <hi>Solomon Creſſon</hi> in a <hi>Cannoo,</hi> with two <hi>Indians:</hi> The old <hi>Caſſekey</hi> began to examine him concerning our Veſſel, Goods and Money, or Plate; of which <hi>Solomon</hi> render'd a further Account unto him, than we could: Which cauſed him to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolve, on the Morrow to provide Men and Boats, and to go down the Sound to <hi>Hoebay,</hi> to have Part from them. He would have had <hi>Solomon</hi> to have gone with him, but <hi>Solomon</hi> refuſed.</p>
               <p>We enquired of <hi>Solomon</hi> concerning his ſtay, and of

the Negro <hi>Ben</hi> and <hi>Joſeph Kirle</hi>'s Boy: He ſaid, that he was ſtayed by force; but the <hi>Negro</hi> and the <hi>Boy</hi> were aſleep in another Houſe when we were driven away. They had a deſign, in ſtaying of <hi>Solomon,</hi> which he could not rightly underſtand, but ſuppoſed, that they doubted that we were not all <hi>Spaniards</hi>; for the <hi>Indians</hi> of <hi>St. Lucia</hi> would ſay to <hi>Solomon,</hi> that he was a <hi>Spaniard,</hi> and ſome others, but the moſt of us were not <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and that they had ſtolen <hi>Solomon</hi>: But <hi>Solomon</hi> denyed it.</p>

from me) whom he had got from the <hi>Indians</hi> at <hi>Hoe-Bay</hi>: Upon this Cheſt he ſat croſs-legged, being newly painted red, his Men with Poles ſetting the Cannoos along unto the Shore. Seeing us, he cryed [<hi>Whough</hi>] and look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed very ſternly at us. He was received by his People with great Homage, holding out his Hands (as their Cuſtom is) to be kiſſed, having his Cheſt carried before him unto his Houſe, whither he went, the Houſe being filled with <hi>Indians.</hi> The Old <hi>Caſſekey</hi> began, and held a Diſcourſe for ſome Hours, giving an Account, as we ſuppoſe, what he heard and ſaw; in which Diſcourſe, he would often mention, <hi>Nickaleer</hi>; which cauſed us to fear, that all Things were not well: After he had told his Story, and ſome of the Elder <hi>Indians</hi> had expreſt their Sentiments thereof, they Drank <hi>Caſſeena,</hi> and Smoaked un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>til Evening. The Houſe being clear, the Old <hi>Caſſekey</hi> looking very unpleſantly, ſhewed unto us ſeveral Things which he had got; as, a Hatchet, a Knife, the Cheſt, and many other Things, asking us, if they were not ours? Which we owned; whereupon he would ſay, they were <hi>Nickaleer</hi> (or <hi>Engliſh</hi>:) We ſignified that we had them of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> but our Money was <hi>Spaniſh.</hi> To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the Evening, <hi>Joſeph Kirle,</hi> my ſelf and <hi>Solomon,</hi> got an Opportunity to Diſcourſe him; we began to urge his Promiſe, of carrying us for <hi>Auguſteen</hi>: At firſt he ſtated his Hardſhips and Labour to <hi>Hoe-Bay,</hi> and back, and that he muſt have Time to reſt, before he could go out again: Then he told us, the Way was long, and would be tedious, and that at ſeveral Places we muſt draw the Cannoos over Land for a great diſtance; he alſo mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed how many Towns there were between this, and <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteen,</hi> in Number Ten; But nigh the Concluſion, be ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting an angry Countenance upon us, told us, that at <hi>Hoe-Bay</hi> he was informed, that we ſhould ſay, <hi>We were all Engliſh men</hi>; after he ſaid this, in an angry Manner, he turn'd from us, and went away.</p>
               <p>This laid all our hopes in the Duſt, and we ſoon per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the <hi>Indians</hi> grew jealous of us; for they would now

be daily asking us, if we were not, <hi>Nickaleer</hi> or <hi>Engliſh</hi>? And would not ſeem ſatisfied with a denial. Many Days were ſpent, and the Time drew nigh, that we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the Old <hi>Caſſekey</hi> was intended for <hi>Auguſteen</hi>; here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon we apply'd our ſelves to him, requeſting, that if all might not go, he would carry ſome of us; but he told us, he would carry but one. This put us on querying, which of us ſhould be that One. The Generality was for Me; but I and <hi>Joſeph Kirle</hi> were for <hi>Solomon</hi>; becauſe he could ſpeak the <hi>Spaniſh-Language</hi> well, and no other of us could: And ſhould any other of us have gone, and come amongſt thoſe <hi>Indians</hi> to the Northward; who, we ſuppoſed, could ſpeak the <hi>Spaniſh-Language</hi> well, we ſhould be diſcovered to be what thoſe People did ſupoſe we were; therefore it might overthrow all our <hi>Expectation</hi>; but <hi>Solomon</hi> might paſs all thoſe Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jections.

               <p>This Day-morning, the old <hi>Caſſekey,</hi> with <hi>Solomon,</hi> and ſix <hi>Indians,</hi> in a Cannoo, ſet out for <hi>Auguſteen.</hi> The <hi>Caſſekey</hi> carried a ſmall Cheſt, in which was nigh One Hundred <hi>Pieces of Eight,</hi> as ſome of our People did ſuppoſe, with ſome other Matters that were gotten from our Veſſel. The Weather was likely for Rain, which
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:006658_0045_102976BF9488E988"/>
cauſed us to fear, ſhould the Weather prove bad, that <hi>Solomon</hi> would hardly live to get to <hi>Auguſteen</hi>; for he had nothing to cover him except a pair of <hi>Indian Breeches,</hi> and a ſmall piece of Skin that covered his Breaſt.</p>
               <p>We underſtood by the old <hi>Caſſekey,</hi> that it would be a <hi>Month,</hi> or next <hi>New Moon,</hi> before we could expect their Return: All which Time we ſpent in much Trouble and Hardſhip. The Weather began to grow cold, and Proviſion very ſhort; that is, <hi>Palm-Berries, Coker-Plumbs,</hi> and <hi>Sea-Grapes,</hi> (which are the three Sorts before ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed) the Time of theſe Fruits-bearing being over, they having no Sort of Fruit till next Spring.</p>
               <p>Theſe People neither Sow nor Plant any manner of Thing whatſoever, nor Care for any Thing, but what the Barren Sands Produce: Fiſh they have as plenty as they pleaſe, but ſometimes they would make it ſcarce to us; ſo that a Meal in a Week was moſt commonly our portion, and three Meals a Rarity. After the old <hi>Caſſekey's</hi> De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture, our Hardſhips increaſed, eſpecially my Wife's and Child's for want of Food of any Sort; my Wife's Milk was gone, and our poor Child was in great want; the <hi>Indians</hi> now and then would give it ſuck, but rarely to ſatisfie it; for there was a Woman or two of their own which had young Children, and not able to ſuckle them. Our Extremity was ſuch, that any manner of Thing would go down with us; the Gills and Guts of Fiſh, pick'd off a Dung-hill, was acceptable; the Scraps the <hi>Indians</hi> threw away, and the Water they boyled their Fiſh in, we were thankfull for, tho' never ſo undecently handled by them. And tho' my Wife had hardly any Milk for her Child, yet an <hi>Indian-Woman,</hi> who was lately deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of a Child, and had no Milk in her Breaſt, would have had her to ſuckle her Child; which my Wife con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented unto.

<pb n="38" facs="unknown:006658_0046_102976C2A29BECA0"/>
they had ſome ill Intent towards the whole of us; at other Times, they would tell us, (who were nominally <hi>Spaniards</hi>) How and in what Manner thoſe of <hi>Smith's</hi> Company ſhould be put to Death. And thus were we daily exerciſed in Sorrow and grievous Troubles. Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times doubt would ariſe amongſt us, concerning what would be the End of us, and what manner of Deaths we ſhould paſs through: And whomſoever theſe Doubts did appear in, it would be hard for another to help with Counſel: But ſome there were, whoſe Hope never failed, they truſting in the Lord to work our Deliverance. One thing did ſeem more grievous to me and my Wife, than any other Thing, which was. That if it ſhould ſo hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, that we ſhould be put to Death, we feared that our Child would be kept Alive, and bred up as one of thoſe People: When theſe Thoughts did ariſe, it wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us deep.</p>
               <p>This Day, being the Time of the Moon's entering the Firſt Quarter, the <hi>Indians</hi> have a Ceremonious Dance, which they begin about Eight a Clock in the Morning: In the firſt Place comes an old Man, and takes a Staff, about eight Foot long, having a broad <hi>Arrow</hi> on the head thereof, and thence half way painted Red and White, like unto a <hi>Barker's-Pole</hi>
                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in the middle of this Staff is fix'd a piece of Wood, ſhaped like unto a Thigh, Leg and Foot of a Man; and the lower Part thereof is painted Black; and this Staff being carried out of the <hi>Caſſekey's</hi> Houſe, is ſet faſt in the Ground, ſtanding up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right; this done, he alſo brings out a Basket, containing Six Rattles, which are taken out of the Basket, and placed at the Foot of his Staff; then another old Man comes, and ſets up a Howling, like unto a mighty Dog, but beyond him for length of Breath; withal making a <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation:</hi> This being done, the moſt of them having painted themſelves, ſome red, ſome Black, ſome with Black and red; with their Belly girt up as Tight as well they can Gird themſelves with Ropes, having their Sheafs of <hi>Arrows</hi> at their Backs, and their <hi>Bows</hi> in their Hands;

being gathered together about this Staff, ſix of the chiefeſt Men in Eſteem amongſt them, eſpecially one who is their <hi>Doctor,</hi> and much eſteemed, taking up the Rattles, begin a hideous Noiſe, ſtanding round this Staff, ſhaking their Rattles, and bowing without ceaſing unto the Staff for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout half an Hour; whilſt theſe ſix are thus imployed, all the reſt are ſtaring and ſcraching, pointing upwards and downwards, on this and the other Side, every way, look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing like Men frighted, or more like Furries; thus behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themſelves until the ſix have done ſhaking their Rattles. Then they all begin a Dance, violently ſtamping on the Ground, for the Space of an Hour or more, without ceaſing: In which Time they will ſweat in a moſt ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive Manner, that by the Time the Dance is over, what by their Sweat, and the violent ſtamping of their Feet, the Ground is trodden into Furrows; and by the Morning, the Place where they danced was covered with <hi>Maggots</hi>: Thus, often repeating the Manner, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue till about three or four a Clock in the Afternoon; by which Time many were ſick and fainty. And then, being gathered into the <hi>Caſſekey's</hi> Houſe, they ſit down, having ſome hot <hi>Caſſeena</hi> ready, which they drink plenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and give greater quantities thereof to the Sick and Fainty, than to others: Then they eat Berries. On theſe Days they eat not any Food till Night.</p>

               <p>About this Time <hi>John Smith</hi> and <hi>Andrew Morray</hi> were ſharply ſeized with a Fever and Ague: When the Fit of the Ague was on them, the <hi>Indians</hi> would mock and deride them: This we well obſerved, that theſe People had no Compaſſion on their own Aged declining People, when they were paſt their Labour, nor on others of their own, which lay in any declining Condition: For the Younger is ſerved before the Elder, and the Elder People, both Men and Women, are Slaves to the Younger.</p>
               <p>In this Place we ſaw many Tokens of ſome of our Nation's having fallen into the Hands of theſe People: As, two Engliſh Cannoos, one of Cedar, the other of <hi>Cotton-Tree,</hi> like thoſe of <hi>Jamaica</hi>; ſeveral Blocks and Shelves of <hi>Lignum-Vitae</hi>; ſeveral Tools and Knives, and more particularly, a <hi>Razor,</hi> on the haft of which, was writ the Man's Name, thus, THOMAS FOSTER.

               <p>Here was a Man in this Town, who, ſome Years paſt, had been taken off by ſome of our Engliſh Sloops for a Diver on the Wreck, to the Eaſtward of <hi>Cuba,</hi> where he was ſometime: But the Veſſel putting into <hi>Cuba,</hi> for Water, this <hi>Indian</hi> Swam on Shore, and got to the <hi>Havanna,</hi> thence to <hi>Auguſteen,</hi> and ſo to his Native Town.

               <p>They inquired what became of the Boat that belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to Smith's Veſſel and ours, we told them, that theſe <hi>Indians</hi> had taken Smith's Boat and ſunk her ſomewhere in the Sound, but ours was at St. <hi>Lucia:</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> made the <hi>Indians</hi> go and ſhew where they had ſunk Smith's Boat, and help our People to get her up; which being done, ſhe was brought to the Town: The <hi>Spaniards</hi> were mightily pleaſed with her, and propoſed, that they in their Cannoo, and our People in that Boat, ſhould go to <hi>Hoe-Bay,</hi> whereby they might get all from the <hi>Indians,</hi> which they had gotten from us, but we would not countenance the Matter: We were for us ſpeedy de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parting from amongſt theſe People, as we could, ſince it pleaſed God to open a Way for our Deliverance.</p>
               <p>This Morning the Spaniſh Captain made the <hi>Indians</hi> provide two Cannoos, which he cauſed to be laſhed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, at ſome diſtance, with Sticks a croſs, and mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the Top; which being done, with four <hi>Indians, Joſeph Kirle, John Smith, Robert Barrow, Andrew Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ray, Benjamin Allen, Nathaniel Randall, John Shears, Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelius Toker, Joſeph Kirle's Boy John Hilliar, four Negors, viz. Jack, Caeſar, Sarah and Quenza,</hi> were ſent away for <hi>Auguſteen</hi>; but not one Morſel of Victuals, except a very few Berries, had they with them; and not one <hi>Spaniard</hi> to Guard them, but were put under the Government of thoſe four <hi>Indians.</hi> About an Hour after <hi>Joſeph Kirle</hi> was gone, the Spaniſh Captain ordered Smith's Boat to be get ready, with two <hi>Spaniards,</hi> and four of our Men, to row to the Place where the drift of Smith's Veſſel was, to look for <hi>Log-wood</hi> or old Iron. When they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, there was not any Thing of Value: But our People ſaid, that as they were ſearching about, they found the Bones of <hi>Andrew Barns</hi>; his Skull and Jaw-Bone were broken, which occaſioned us ſuſpect, that he was
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:006658_0052_102976D52F6C4240"/>
knocked on the Head by the <hi>Indians,</hi> after they had driven away <hi>Smith</hi> and his People.</p>
               <p>We told the Spaniſh Captain, that <hi>Joſeph Kirle's Negro,</hi> Ben, had been abſent, ever ſince the Day after <hi>Solomon Creſſon</hi> went hence, being gone with the Old <hi>Caſſekey's</hi> Wife, but we knew not whither. The Captain made inquiry of the <hi>Indians</hi> whither he was gone; they ſaid, for <hi>Hoe-Bay:</hi> Then be ordered them to ſend for him, for he would not leave him behind: The <hi>Indians</hi> ſaid, he would be here within a Day or two.</p>
               <p>The Spaniards were continually ſearching for what they could find, of ſuch Things as the <hi>Indians</hi> had gotten from us or others: And when they could find no more, they would offer to buy with Tobacco what they could perſwade the <hi>Indians</hi> to bring to Light A Leaf, or half a Leaf of Tobacco, would purchaſe a Yard of Linen or Woollen, or Silk, from the <hi>Indians</hi>; ſuch Admirers of Tobacco are they, that they eſteem it beyond any other Thing.</p>
               <p>An <hi>Indian</hi> of the Town, ſometime before the Spaniards came, having a conſiderable Quantity of <hi>Ambergreece</hi> boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that when he went for <hi>Auguſteen</hi> with that, he could purchaſe of the Spaniards, a <hi>Looking-Glaſs,</hi> an <hi>Ax,</hi> a <hi>Knife</hi> or two, and three or four <hi>Mannocoes,</hi> (which is about five or ſix Pounds) of Tobacco: The Quantity of <hi>Am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber-greece</hi> might be about five Pound weight.</p>

               <p>This Day we made Oars for Smith's Boat, of Sticks, and the Cantle-pieces of Sugar-Hogſheads, which were gotten on the Beach, where the drift of Smith's Veſſel came on Shore: And this Evening came the Old <hi>Caſſekey's</hi> Wife, with <hi>Joſeph Kirle's</hi> Negro <hi>Ben,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph Kirle's</hi> Boat, which was of great advantage to help to carry us. We work'd all this Night to fit the Boat, and Oars unto her, being intented to go away, as ſoon as we could compleat that Jobb.</p>
               <p>The Spaniards had brought little Proviſion with them, ſo that there was not much to ſpare for us, having not

above a Rove of Corn, and a little <hi>New-Spain</hi> Bread, which was ſo bad, that it was more Duſt, and dead Wevels, than Bread; an handful of it was an acceptable Preſent to us. We would mix it with a little Water, making it into a Paſte, which would eat pleaſantly; but Hunger was no Stranger unto us, and we knew not that we ſhould have any Victuals on our Journey; but our Deliverance ſeem'd to over-ballance all. The <hi>Indians</hi> would not give us any Berries; but our People watch'd an Opportunity, and took one of the <hi>Caſſekey's</hi> Bags of Berries, which might contain about a Buſhel, which was all that One and Thirty of us had to depend on.</p>

               <p>This Morning, about three Hours before Day, we departed from this Town of <hi>Jece</hi>; the weather was grown Cold, we had nothing wherewith to cover our Bodies, beſides what the <hi>Indians</hi> gave us at firſt, except my Wife, for whom the Spaniards got an old Jacket (which had been one of Smith's Men's) and gave her to wear; alſo a ſmall piece of Cloth to cover our poor Child: But it pleaſed God to ſtrengthen us, in this our Condition, ſo that we rowed all this Day without ceaſing, untill three Hours after it was dark, by which Time we got to an <hi>Indian-Town:</hi> Here we met with <hi>Joſeph Kirle, Robert Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row</hi> and the others, who got thither not above an Hour or two bfore us. They had not received any Manner of Suſtenance from the Time they left us, untill they got ſome Berries of us, having lain one Night of the two in a <hi>Swamp</hi>; but they were as cheerful as Men could be in this Straight.</p>
               <p>Since they left us, amongſt their other Hardſhips, <hi>Joſeph Kirle</hi> had like to have loſt his Life ſeveral Times: The firſt was thus, Whilſt the two Cannoos were laſhed to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, having a few Berries, that were deſigned to have been ſhared amongſt them, the Iriſh-Boy, <hi>Cornelius Toker,</hi> would ever and non be taking ſome of them; who, being often Reproved by <hi>Joſeph Kirle</hi> and others, would not deſiſt; whereupon <hi>Joſeph Kirle,</hi> with the Paddle he paddled
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:006658_0054_102976DCC0FCAB98"/>
the Cannoo along with, ſtruck him; thereupon an <hi>Indian</hi> took his <hi>Bow</hi> and <hi>Arrow,</hi> and was going to ſhoot <hi>Joſeph</hi>; (who ſeemed little concerned, whether he lived or died) withal ſaying, The <hi>Spaniards</hi> would juſtifie him.</p>
               <p>Another Time, when he was ſpent with paddling the Cannoo, and deſired <hi>John Smith, Andrew Murray,</hi> and others of them, as well able as himſelf, to give him a Spell, which they refuſed; he being not able to paddle further, laid down his paddle; whereupon the <hi>Indians</hi> commanding him to paddle, he refuſed, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, they might kill him if they would; opening his Breaſt for them to execute their Wills: Which they ſeemed as though they would have done; but, after great threatning they deſiſted.</p>
               <p>Another Time, The Wind being high, and the Seas rough, that they were forced to unlaſh their Cannoos, by <hi>Joſeph Kirle's</hi> perſwaſion, and to go ſingle; <hi>Joſeph Kirle</hi> taking one Cannoo to his own Management, ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>Robert Barrow,</hi> his Boy, my Kinſman, <hi>Nathaniel Randal,</hi> and the <hi>Negroes,</hi> in her; which, being thus ſingle from the other Company, was more ſatisfactory to him than before, tho' none to help but <hi>Nathaniel Randal,</hi> My <hi>Negro-Woman,</hi> named <hi>Sarah,</hi> having beaten and abuſed a Girl, named <hi>Quenza</hi>; being reproved often by him and <hi>Robert Barrow,</hi> ſhe therefore abuſed them in an extraordinary Manner; whereupon <hi>Joſeph</hi> ſtruck her with the Paddle; at which, one of the <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians,</hi> in the other Cannoo, took his ſtriking Staff and darted at him, narrowly miſſing him.</p>
               <p>This Morning, <hi>Joſeph Kirle,</hi> with thoſe that were with him, were, by the <hi>Spaniſh Captain,</hi> ordered away at Break of Day, he not taking any care to give them a little Suſtenance; and about an Hour or two after we followed, rowing all this Day without ceaſing, until an Hour or two in the Night: By which Time we got to an <hi>Indian-Town,</hi> where not any Thing was to be had but Water: About two Hours after us came <hi>Joſeph

               <p>This Morning we ſet forward very early, and rowed hard: About Noon we got to a parcel of <hi>Marſhy Iſlands,</hi> amongſt which we were to go up Creeks: The Paſſage was very difficult to find. At length, when we were got nigh an <hi>Indian-Town,</hi> the <hi>Spaniards</hi> hollowed, and an <hi>Indian</hi> came out into the Marſh, but was very loath to come near us; at length he came wading to us to be our Pilot: We ſet forward, and in an Hour's Time, or more, were got to the place where <hi>Joſeph Kirle,</hi> and thoſe with him, were; the <hi>Indians</hi> that were with <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeph</hi> would not let them proceed further, until we came up with them. In half an Hour's Time we got to the Place where we were to hale our Boats over Land, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about a Quarter of a Mile from Sound to Sound: At this Place the Sea was half a Furlong from us. The <hi>Spaniſh Captain</hi> gave the <hi>Indian,</hi> we laſt took in, a piece of a Leaf of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> commanding him to go, with all ſpeed, and bid his <hi>Caſſekey,</hi> with all his able Men, come to help to hale our Boats over Land. But we ſet to work, and had them over by that Time the <hi>Indians</hi> came. The <hi>Spaniſh Captain</hi> gave the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> a Leaf or two of <hi>Tobacco,</hi> and diſcharged them; only ordered the <hi>Caſſekey</hi> to ſend ſome Men a Fiſhing for him; which they did, and before Night brought a ſtately Parcel of Fiſh; but none of our People had any Part of it, except my <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Penelope:</hi> What they did not eat, they kept to carry with them.</p>
               <p>A little before Night, ſprang up a Storm of Wind at North-Eaſt.

               <p>This Morning we ſet forward, but the Water was ſo low, that we were forc'd to wade, and thruſt the Boat along for ſome Miles: At length we got into a deep Channel, where was nothing to be ſeen but Marſh and Water, and no faſt Land, nor Trees.

pounded to mix with Water, to feed our Child with; the Fire being diſturbed, the Cloth which we had our Food in was burn'd; all was loſt, and nothing to be had untill we could get to the <hi>Spaniards,</hi> which was two Days March at leaſt: About an Hour after this, the Wind roſe at <hi>North-Weſt,</hi> and it began to Rain; but having ſmall <hi>Palmetto</hi> which grew nigh, <hi>Joſeph Kirle</hi> and I ſet to Work, and made a Shelter, which would keep Ten or more of us from the Weather: We had no ſooner compleated our Work, but it rained hard.

Having got through the Boggy Marſh, and on the Sea-Shore, our People, Black and White, made all Speed, one not ſtaying for another that could not Travel ſo faſt: none but I, with my Wife and Child, <hi>Robert Barrow,</hi> my Kinſman <hi>Benjamin Allen,</hi> and my Negro <hi>London,</hi> whom I kept to help carry my Child, keeping together; the reſt of our Company had left us, not expecting to ſee ſome of us again; eſpecially <hi>Robert Barrow,</hi> my Wife and Child.

this ſtrait we knew not what to do; to ſtay with him we muſt periſh alſo, and we were willing to ſtrive as long as we could. We carried our Kinſman, and laid him un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Bank, not being Dead; I reſolved to run after our People, ſome of them not being out of Sight; which I did, and left my Wife and Child, with the Negro, to follow as faſt as they could. I run about two Miles, making ſigns to them, thinking if they ſhould look behind them, and ſee me running, they would ſtop till I got up with them. I was in hopes, if I could have accompliſhed this my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign, to have got help to have carried my Kinſman along; but they ſtopp'd not, and I ran until the Wind pierced me, ſo that my Limbs failed, and I fell; yet ſtill I ſtrove and getting up, walked backwards to meet my Wife; as I was going, I met with the <hi>Spaniard</hi> coming out of the Sand-Hills, and <hi>Joſeph Kirle's Negro Ben.</hi> I made my Complaint to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> but he not being able to underſtand me well, went forward. I then apply'd my ſelf to the Negro, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing large Promiſes, if he would fetch my Kinſman; he of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered to go back, and uſed his endeavour, which he did. At length my <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Child</hi> came up with me, ſhe was almoſt overcome with Grief, expreſſing in what Manner we were forced to part with our Kinſman; and expecting that ſhe and the Child ſhould go next.</p>
               <p>Poor <hi>Robert Barrow</hi> was a great way behind us, I feared we ſhould never ſee him again. I uſed my endeavour to comfort and cheer my Wife, intreating her not to let Grief overcome her: I had hopes that the Lord would help us in this ſtraight, as he had done in many ſince we were in this Land: And if it pleaſed God that we ſhould lay down our Lives in this Wilderneſs, that we might beſeech him to enable us to do it willingly. Thus ſtriving in a deep Exerciſe of Body and Mind, we travelled on, admiring God's Goodneſs in preſerving us thus far through ſo many eminent Dangers; in the ſenſe of which, a ſecret hope would ariſe, (tho' involved with human Doubts and Fears) That the Lord would yet preſerve us. I took my Child from the Negro, and caried him. I had an <hi>Indian-Mat,</hi> with

a ſplit in it, through which I put my Head, hanging over my Breaſt unto my Waſte; under this I carried my Child, which help'd to break the Wind off it; but the poor Babe was black with cold from Head to Foot, and its Fleſh as cold as a Stone; yet it was not froward. Its Mother would take it now and then, and give it the Breaſt, but little could it get at it: Beſides, we dared not ſtop in the leaſt; for if we did, we ſhould perceive our Limbs to fail. About two a Clock in the Afternoon, we came up with our Negro-Woman <hi>Hagar,</hi> with her Child at her Back, almoſt dead: And a little further we came up with our Negro-Girl <hi>Quen<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

We carried her from the Water-Side, under the Bank. This increaſed my Wife's Sorrow, and ſhe began to doubt, ſhe ſhould not be able to travel much further; but I endeavor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to encourage her, not to leave her ſtriving, as long as any Ability was left. All our People were out of Sight except four, and thoſe we had gained upon. I ſent my Negro to overtake them, and to deſire them to ſlacken their pace, till we got up with them; being in hopes, that gaining their Company, would cheer up my Wife; but they would not; ſo the Negro ſtopp'd for us. We had loſt ſight of <hi>Robert Barrow</hi> by this Time. Soon after we overtook <hi>John Smith,</hi> who was one of the four; he began to fail and his Companions left him; whereupon he made grievous Complaints, which I reproved him for, leſt he ſhould diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage my Wife.

This was terrible to us all; for the Day being ſo cold, the Night much more, and we not able to travel without reſt; being a ſtarved People, both within our Bodies and without; and if we ceaſed from travelling we ſhould inſtantly be nummed and move no further. In the midſt of theſe Reaſonings and Doubtings, we were got into, I

eſpyed a Man, as I thought, ſtanding on the Bank, but at great diſtance; I was afraid to ſpeak, leſt it ſhould prove otherwiſe, but he was ſoon ſeen by the whole Company; and at length we eſpy'd him walking towards the Land, this confirmed us; and ſo we betook to the Hills again, to look out, yet could not ſee the Houſe from thence; but on the next Hill we ſaw it: This was Joy unto us, though we began to have a Senſe of our tiredneſs; for our Reſolution abated, after we had got Sight of the Houſe.</p>
               <p>When we got to the Houſe, we found four Sentinals, and the <hi>Spaniard</hi> our Guide, with three of our Men, viz. <hi>Joſeph Buckley, Nathaniel Randal,</hi> and <hi>John Shires.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> bid us welcome, and made Room for us to ſit down by the Fire. The chiefeſt Man of the Sentinals took a <hi>Kerſey-Coat</hi> and gave my Wife to cover her, and gave each of us a piece of Bread, made of <hi>Indian-Corn,</hi> which was pleaſant unto us; after it we had plenty of hot <hi>Caſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeena-Drink.</hi> It was dark, and we endeavoured to prevail with the <hi>Spaniards</hi> to go ſeek for <hi>Robert Barrow</hi> and my <hi>Kinſman,</hi> oftering them conſiderable; but they ſeemed not fully to underſtand me, yet I could make them ſenſible, that my <hi>Kinſman</hi> was almoſt dead, if not quite; and that the <hi>Old Man</hi> was in a bad Condition. They made me to underſtand, that the Weather was not fit to go out, but they would watch if <hi>Robert</hi> would paſs by. About an Hour or two after, one of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> being walking out on the Bay, met with <hi>Robert,</hi> and brought him into the Houſe: We rejoiced to ſee him, and enquired concerning our <hi>Kinſman</hi> and Negro <hi>Ben.</hi> He ſaid, our <hi>Kinſman</hi> was ſtriving to get up, and could not; he came to him, and ſpake unto him; he could not anſwer, but cry'd, and he could not help him. But coming along, at ſome conſiderable diſtance, met Negro <hi>Ben,</hi> who ſaid he was going for <hi>Benjamin Allen,</hi> ſo he paſt him. And ſome Miles further, he ſaw Negro <hi>Jack,</hi> drawing himſelf down from the Bank, his Lower Parts being dead, and crying out for ſome Fire, that he might ſave his Life; but did not ſee the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gro

Girl, whom we halled out of the Way. We were under a great Concern for our Kinſman; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> we could not prevail upon to go and fetch him, or go and carry wherewith to make a Fire; which had they done, and found them living, it might have preſerved them. But we hoped Negro <hi>Ben.</hi> would bring our Kinſman. The <hi>Spaniards</hi> would have had moſt of us to have gone to the next Sentinal's Houſe, which was a League farther, but we all begged hard of them to let us lye in their Houſe, in any Place, on the Ground; for we were not able to travel further: Beſides, the cold would kill us; for we were in ſuch a trembling ſhaking Condition, and ſo full of pain, from Head to Foot, that it's not to be expreſſed. At length the <hi>Spaniards</hi> conſented, that <hi>Robert Barrow, I,</hi> my <hi>Wife</hi> and <hi>Child,</hi> and <hi>John Smith,</hi> ſhould lye in the Houſe; but to <hi>Joſeph Buckley, Nathaniel Ran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dal, John Sheirs,</hi> and my Negro <hi>London,</hi> they would not grant that Favour. So one of the <hi>Spaniards</hi> taking a Fire-brand, bid theſe four to go with him; he directed them to a ſmall Thicket of Trees, and ſhewed them to gather Wood, and make large Fires, and ſleep there. Theſe poor Creatures lay out, and it proved a hard froſty Night. The <hi>Spaniard</hi> returned and ſaid, they were got into a Wood, and had Fire enough. We were ſilent, but feared they would hardly live till Morning.</p>
               <p>After they were gone, the <hi>Spaniards</hi> took a Pint of <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian-Corn,</hi> and parched it, and gave part to us, which we accepted cheerfully; alſo they gave us ſome <hi>Caſſeena-drink</hi>

As we were all going, one <hi>Spaniard</hi> made ſign for me and my Wife to ſtay, which we did, and it was to have a Handful of parch'd Corn. As ſoon as we had received it, they bid us to be gone to the next Sentinel's, where was Victuals enough for us. The Sun was a great height, but we could not feel any warmth it gave; the <hi>North-Weſter</hi> beginning to blow as hard as it did the Day before. And having deep Sand to travel through, which made our Travelling this one League very hard, eſpecially to my Wife and <hi>Robert.</hi> The <hi>Spaniards</hi> lent my Wife a Blanket to be left at the next Sentinal's Houſe.</p>
               <p>At length we came to an Inlet of the Sea; on the other Side was the Look-out and Sentinal's Houſe: Here were all our People ſitting, waiting to be carried over, and in a little Time came one of the Sentinals, with a Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noo, and carried us over.</p>
               <p>This Sentinal would not ſuffer us to come into his Houſe, but cauſed us to kindle a Fire under the Lee of his Houſe, and there ſit down: About half an Hour after he bid us be gone to the next Sentinal's, which was a League further, giving us a Cup of <hi>Caſſeena,</hi> and two Quarts of <hi>Indian-Corn</hi> for us all, bidding us go to our Company at the next Houſe, and get our Corn dreſſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When the Cannoo came over for us, our Guide took the Blanket from my Wife; but the <hi>Negro,</hi> which brought over the Cannoo, lent my Wife one of his Coats, ſo we got over; but before we got to the Houſe, we had a Shower of Hail. At this Houſe we were kindly received, having ſuch a Meſs of Victuals, as we had not had in a long Time before, which was very pleaſant to our Hunger ſtarv'd Stomachs. Our People went hence this Morning for <hi>Auguſteen,</hi> having a Guide with them; but <hi>John Hoſler</hi> and <hi>Penelope</hi> were left here, not being able to travel.

               <p>An hour before Sun-ſet we got to the Town, call'd St. <hi>Mary</hi>'s: This is a Frontier, and a Garriſon Town; the Inhabitants are <hi>Indians,</hi> with ſome <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Soldiers.

               <p>The Night was exteam Foggy, and ſo was this Morning; but we ſearched about and found our Paſſage, being a little Channel juſt broad enough for our Boats to paſs, and a Mile in length. After we paſt this, we came into a great Sound, which went down into a large Inlet, that the <hi>Land</hi> could not be ſeen from the one ſide to the other. Into the Sound comes down a great River, called the <hi>Savanna-River</hi>; which, when we got into the Courſe of it, the Water was freſh, tho' in this great Sound; the <hi>Spaniards</hi> called it, the <hi>Croſs-Bar,</hi> or <hi>St. a Cruce.</hi> About Noon we got over this Sound; and here we rowed out to Sea for two Leagues, to get into another Sound. And about three a Clock, the Wind began to blow at <hi>North-Eaſt,</hi> and it looked very black, ſo that we feared a Storm. We deſired to get on Shoar, to provide againſt it; but the Captain ſaid, about a few Leagues further we ſhould get near <hi>Port-Royal</hi>: But in the interim, we ſaw a <hi>Cannoo</hi> on the Shoar; we made to her, and there we found ſome <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dian Wigwams:</hi> Here we went on Shoar.

ſo we ſet to work to mend them.
