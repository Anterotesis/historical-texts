            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HESE Words are a Branch of <hi>David</hi>'s Character, one of the moſt politic Princes and greateſt Captains of his Day; to whoſe military Proweſs, under GOD, was owing the growing Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Nation, now near the Summit of it's Perfection. The Fame of him had gone far and wide, beyond the Limits of <hi>Judea</hi>; his very Name opened to him the Way to Victory, <hi>and the Lord bro't the Fear of him upon all Nations.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Chron. xiv.17.</note>
            </p>

               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:005470_0008_101838593472F8B0"/>This is not the only Place in which the ſame Character is given him. It was part of the Recommendation which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduced him at firſt into the Preſence of <hi>Saul,</hi> and opened the Way to his Marriage with a Daughter of that King, and after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards to the Throne of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>That this was his eſtabliſhed Character appears, not only from the Hiſtory of his Life, but alſo from the Argument of <hi>Huſhai,</hi> the King's Friend, in the Text and Context; and the Succeſs of it. For to what elſe is it to be aſcribed, but the Terror of his Name, that the Counſel which <hi>Huſhai</hi> gave, ſo manifeſtly deſigned to further the Eſcape of the King, ſhould prevail in Oppoſition to that of <hi>Ahitophel,</hi> the Oracle of the Age? Which, had it been purſued, muſt undoubtedly have iſſued in the utter Ruin of <hi>David,</hi> and the Eſtabliſhment of his rebellious Son in his uſurped Dominion? It was <hi>Ahitophel</hi>'s Opinion that the King was now to be followed with a ſelect Body of Troops, while weary and weak handed: And that he knew well, this was the Moment of Succeſs and Victory, and Criſis of <hi>Abſolom</hi>'s Affairs, appears from the Deſpair into which he fell upon his Counſel's being rejected.</p>
            <p>From this probable Deſign, <hi>Abſolom</hi> and his Courtiers were diverted by the Argument of <hi>Huſhai,</hi> in which he ſtrenuouſly applies to their Fears; and repreſents the Danger of the Enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prize from the heroick Qualities of <hi>David</hi> and his Men. <hi>Thou knoweſt thy Father and his Men,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>that they be mighty Men; and they be chaffed in their Minds, as a Bear robbed of her Whelps in the Field:</hi> AND THY FATHER IS A MAN OF WAR, <hi>and will not lodge with the People.</hi> Here let me obſerve, This is not the firſt Time that a well laid wicked Deſign hath been conducted to the true Moment of Execution, and then failed thro' Cowardiſe, and, perhaps, the magnified Dangers repreſented by a guilty Conſcience.</p>
            <p>The Phraſe of the Text is capable of the greateſt Latitude<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Yet I ſuppoſe, by what follows, <hi>Huſhai</hi> had his Eye upon the <hi>political</hi> Part of it. <hi>Ahitophel</hi>'s Scheme propoſed to ſmite the King only, and bring back all the People. And to this it is that <hi>Huſhai</hi> anſwers, <hi>Thy Father is a Man of War and will not lodge with the People<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Behold he is now hid in ſome Pit, or ſome other Place.</hi>

               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:005470_0009_1018385E0EB11008"/>From the Words taken in the largeſt Senſe, I might enter into the <hi>military Character</hi> of an accompliſhed Soldier, deſcribe the Art of War, and point out and recommend the beſt Manner of making it. But this I hope would be without my Province, becauſe I am ſure it is beyond my Capacity. But the <hi>gracious Character,</hi> and moral Accompliſhments of a <hi>military</hi> Man, may well fall under the Conſideration of a Miniſter of JESUS CHRIST, and a Teacher of that Goſpel, in which is bro't down from Heaven, the Wiſdom which is neceſſary for Men in every Station and Condition in Life. Conſidering therefore the words of my Text as ſpoken of a <hi>religious</hi> Hero, I ſhall hence take Occaſion to ſpeak to <hi>chriſtian</hi> Soldiers of that gracious Turn of Mind, and thoſe vertuous Accompliſhments, which will crown their military Atchievements, and be their Security and Glory. This will be to conſider RELIGION in a peculiar Light, and as it hath a ſpecial Relation to a particular Order of Men; a Light in which, I confeſs, I have not been much uſed to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider it; a Light in which I little expected ever to be called to conſider it, and leaſt of all upon this Occaſion.</p>
            <p>In diſcourſing upon theſe Words, what I propoſe to do is,</p>
            <p n="1">I. To conſider more generally, <hi>true Religion,</hi> as a very uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and neceſſary Qualification in the Character of a <hi>Soldier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. I ſhall ſelect out of the Circle of CHRISTIAN GRACES, ſome Vertues as the peculiar <hi>Accompliſhment</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of a Soldier.</p>
            <p n="1">I. <hi>True Religion</hi> is a very requiſite Qualification, in the Character of a <hi>Soldier.</hi> By true Religion, as it appears in the Life, I mean the Man, that, from a juſt Apprehenſion of his Obligations to his Maker and himſelf, and an effectual Belief of the Doctrines and Motives revealed by CHRIST in the Goſpel, hath made a deliberate and moſt ſincere Reſignation of himſelf to GOD; and whoſe Heart, hereupon, is by divine Grace ſtedfaſtly reſolved to purſue eternal Life, in the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of GOD and CHRIST, as his great End, and to make every other Conſideration give Way to this. As there is nothing more reaſonable, than that all our Faculties ſhould be devoted to the Service of GOD, who gave them and claims them, and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:005470_0010_1018385F9A71B6E0"/>
who hath, of his free unmerited Grace in Chriſt, been pleaſed to promiſe to reward the due Exerciſe &amp; Improvement of them; ſo it will be found, upon Examination, to add a true Luſtre to all the Glories of this World, direct the Exerciſe of every Power to its proper End, and give it freſh Vigour in all its Opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Every Order of Men, and the <hi>military</hi> Order in par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, may, if they conſider the Matter, eaſily diſcern the great Advantage of Religion in their proper Calling. I will endeavour to illuſtrate this Point, as briefly as I can, in a few Particulars.</p>
            <p n="1">1. One Advantage of Religion to the Soldier is: it <hi>rectifieth his Aims</hi> and directeth them to true and noble Ends. It enlargeth his Views beyond the Limits of this ſhort Life, and elevates his Deſigns to the unſpeakable and eternal Glories of the heavenly World; which otherwiſe would be confined to the Glories of this, and a deathleſs Fame, as he imagines, after himſelf is dead. Inſtead of this imaginary Immortality, he purſues a real one; and conſiders himſelf as happy in this, that GOD hath placed him in ſuch a Condition of Life and Calling, as gives him an Opportunity to exerciſe the ſublimeſt Grace, whereby he may come at laſt to ſhine in diſtinguiſhing Glory.</p>
            <p>There is indeed a <hi>Love</hi> of <hi>Fame</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> in this World, which is then vertuous when it is purſued in the Paths of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and in Subordination to the Glory of GOD. All Deſire of Glory is not a faulty Ambition, any more than all Love of the World is the Sin of Covetouſneſs; and God himſelf hath been pleaſed to gratify this Deſire, as a Reward of a religious Care to glorify him. <hi>Them that honour me,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>I will honour; and they that deſpiſe me ſhall be lightly eſteemed.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Sam. 2.30.</note> This Deſire of Honour here, under a religious Regulation, as it is in generous Minds a mighty Principle of Action, is ſuted to the nobleſt Purpoſes, gives the World the moſt illuſtrious Examples of great and gracious Actions, and is of moſt efficacious In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence in the Hand of Providence, in bringing about its great Deſigns. And the Soldier, of all Men, is ſuppoſed beſt to know it's Power and Influence upon the Minds and Actions of Men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:005470_0011_1018386126FB2428"/>But it is the Character of the <hi>chriſtian Soldier,</hi> to make every Proſpect of worldly Glory give Place to his Hopes of that which is above. And if at any Time he finds himſelf inclined to purſue worldly Honour, by any Means inconſiſtent with thoſe Hopes, he conſiders it as a Stratagem of his Grand Adverſary the Prince of Darkneſs to deſtroy him. And with a juſt Indignation replies to it, as the Captain of his Salvation did before him, <hi>get thee behind me Satan.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now, this is one great Advantage of Religion to a Soldier; inaſmuch as, by directing his Aims to the Glory of God, it alters the Nature of his Actions, is a Reſtraint from Wickedneſs and Motive to Vertue, and puts him in the Way of obtaining true Happineſs and everlaſting Honour. For he may be aſſured, that as CHRIST <hi>made himſelf of no Reputation, and became obedient to Death, even the Death of the Croſs,</hi> and was therefore by GOD <hi>highly exalted,</hi> and had a <hi>Name given him above every Name, that at the Name of</hi> JESUS <hi>every Knee ſhould bow</hi>; <note n="*" place="bottom">Phil. 2.7, 8, 9, 10.</note> he alſo ſhall be glorified with him, if he imitates his great Example.</p>
            <p n="2">2. True Religion makes the Soldier a <hi>Bleſſing to the World.</hi> For hence, every Enterpriſe being undertaken and conducted with a Regard to the Will of GOD, and conſequently to the Laws of Equity and the good of Mankind, he will not come within Reach of the Pſalmiſt's Imprecation, <hi>Scatter thou the People that delight in War</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. 68.30.</note>. The charitable Spirit of the Goſpel, governing in his ſanctified Mind, makes him value leſs the Glory of Conqueſt than the Happineſs of his Fellow-Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures. He will abhor the Tho'ts of murdering them by Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and ten Thouſands to eterniſe his own Name; and would not invade a peaceable Neighbour, contented within his own juſt Limits, tho' to open the Way to univerſal Empire, and be renowned as <hi>Alexander,</hi> or <hi>Caeſar.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>No; if he Delights in War, it is to ſuppreſs the injurious Spirit, and, if poſſible, deſtroy it out of the World. For ſuch an End he <hi>willingly offers himſelf unto the Lord,</hi> devoting the Strength of his Body, the Fortitude of his Mind, his Eſtate and
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:005470_0012_101838636357D230"/>
Life, and all that is dear to him. Such a Soldier is a Bleſſing to the World, the Defence of the weak, the Security of his Country, and the Scourge of cruel and ambitious Tyrants, the great Diſturbers of the Repoſe and Happineſs of Mankind.</p>
            <p n="3">3. True Religion engageth the <hi>Providence of</hi> GOD <hi>on our Side,</hi> and this is of the greateſt Importance to the Soldier. For, whatever atheiſtical Men have imagined, there is a GOD in Heaven, who is no unconcerned Spectator of what is done on Earth; but holds the Reins of Government in his Hands, and whoſe Counſel ſhall ſtand againſt all the Devices of the Sons of Policy and War. <hi>He putteth down one and ſetteth up another. He maketh the Wrath of Man to praiſe him, and the Remainders of Wrath he reſtrains. It is he who giveth Victory to Kings. Thine O Lord, is the greatneſs, and the Power, and the Glory, and the Victory and the Majeſty; and all that is in the Heavens and the Earth is thine; and there is no Reſtraint to the Lord to ſave by many, or by few.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is not a Doctrine peculiar to Revelation; but hath been aſſented to and practiced upon by the Heathen World. And even thoſe <note n="*" place="bottom">Lacedemonians. <hi>Plut.</hi>
               </note> Nations, that, from Ignorance of the ſupreme Being, and confined Views of the Nature and Perfections of the Deity, accounted it no better than Profaneneſs and Irreverence to their Gods, to invoke them upon Occaſions of leſſer Moment, could not miſs this glaring Truth. There is a divine Providence governing the World, which by ſolemn Prayer is to be engaged on our Side in the great Concerns of War.</p>
            <p>What ſignifies then the moſt refined Policy, or the greateſt Expertneſs in military Affairs, if GOD be with our Adverſaries? <hi>If the Lord be not on our Side, when Men riſe up againſt us, they will ſwallow us up quick, when their Wrath is kinled againſt us.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Pſal. 124, 2, 3.</note>
            </p>
            <p>But the truely religious Soldier hath the greateſt Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to hope in that Providence which extends it ſelf to the minuteſt Circumſtances, as well as to the moſt important Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. And our Saviour hath taught him to conclude that he,
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005470_0013_10183867301D4A90"/>
who cloaths the Lillies of the Field, who feeds the Ravens, and whoſe Providence is concerned in the Fall of a Sparrow, will much more concern himſelf for his own Children.</p>
            <p n="4">4. By Religion thoſe particular <hi>Graces</hi> or <hi>chriſtian Vertuos</hi> are formed into the Soul, and maintained and cheriſhed there, which are the Soldiers peculiar Glory, and of the greateſt Uſefulneſs and Neceſſity in his Calling. It is my Deſign, as I propoſed, to ſpeak to ſome of theſe more particularly preſently. But here I would ſay more generally and briefly.</p>
            <p>By Religion the Soldier learns to deſpiſe the Terrors of Death. A proſpect of Uſefulneſs in this World makes him wiſh to live, that he may attain to the greater Glory hereafter, in the future World: But his Apprehenſion of that Glory makes him wiſh <hi>to depart and be with Chriſt.</hi> By Religion then he is formed to live uſefully, or to die nobly: He is fitted for his Calling in all Conditions, being equally prepared for Victory or Death; and having reſigned himſelf to the Will of GOD, and learned in every State to be content, nothing can come amiſs. If Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers ariſe, if the Clouds gather, and the Heavens grow black, and all the Preſages of a deſolating Tempeſt appear, his religious Mind quiets it ſelf in GOD. He is exerciſed in the Uſe of Weapons peculiarly fitted for the <hi>evil Day</hi>; and hath Advant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ages above others to withſtand; and, <hi>having overcome all, to ſtand.</hi> The <hi>Breaſt-Plate of Righteouſneſs,</hi> the <hi>Shield of Faith,</hi> and <hi>the Hope of Salvation</hi> are his Defence; and <hi>the Sword of the Spirit,</hi> the dread of his ſpiritual Adverſaries, may well be ſo of his earthly ones. By his Prayers, the threatned Dangers are diverted, or he is carried thro' them, and ſometimes mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vellouſly crowned with Succeſs and Victory. But the worſt that can happen is temporal; and this he little regards.</p>
            <p>On the other hand, if he ſucceeds according to his Wiſhes or beyond them, he ſtill maintains an equal Temper of Mind. As Adverſity cannot depreſs him, neither can Succeſs elate him into any indecent Miſbehaviour. And this too Religion doth for him, by begetting and keeping up in his Mind a continual Senſe and Expectation of everlaſting Joys in the Preſence of GOD; Joys too big to leave Room for the meaner ones of
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005470_0014_1018386BE8D7FE60"/>
this ſhort Life; and too entertaining to give way to them.</p>
            <p>I proceed now,</p>
            <p n="2">II. To conſider ſome <hi>chriſtian Graces</hi> as the peculiar <hi>Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>compliſhments</hi> and <hi>Glory</hi> of a Soldier.</p>
            <p n="1">1. In the Front of theſe ſtands <hi>Fortitude.</hi> Chriſtian Forti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude is a Vertue built upon a ſtedfaſt and influential Belief of this practical Principle, that the Path of Duty is always to be purſued thro' the worſt that can happen, and all Events to be left with GOD. It is the <hi>Firmneſs</hi> of a Mind not to be diver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from its Purpoſe by Dangers or Sufferings; but which will riſk every thing that is dear in proportion to the Value of a propoſed End. It is therefore as diſtant from that <hi>Temerity,</hi> which is ſometimes miſtaken for it, when Men hazard their Lives from falſe Notions of Honour, or a kind of enthuſiaſtick Bravery, as Reaſon is from Madneſs. The ſame Reaſon which directs a Man to plunge into the midſt of Dangers when called by his Duty, teacheth him too not to expoſe needleſsly a Life which is of the greateſt Concern to every one.</p>
            <p>This Vertue is the Soldiers peculiar Glory; and the want of it utterly deſtroys his Reputation. The World, from the higheſt to the loweſt, ſeems agreed to pay it the moſt diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Regards: The Recital of brave Facts fires our Minds with a Spirit ſomething like that by which the Hero performed them; and that Hiſtory pleaſeth moſt which is fulleſt of them; while the Heart ſickens within at the Mention of a cowardly Action.</p>
            <p>This Firmneſs and Intrepidity of Spirit owes much to macha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nical Principles; and in this Light is to be conſidered as a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Gift of the GOD of Nature, reſulting from a peculiar Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of the humane Frame, and ſupported by outward Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents in the Courſe of Providence, as Food and Exerciſe pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to that End.</p>
            <p>In this Light, tho' it cannot be conſidered as a <hi>chriſtian Grace,</hi> it ought to be as a <hi>Gift of Nature</hi>; and is indeed a valuable Talent betruſted with the Poſſeſſor, and as ſuch to be improved
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005470_0015_101838725D0F3580"/>
to gracious Purpoſes, and to be accounted for in the great Day of Retribution.</p>
            <p>It is a Qualification very uſeful to a Soldier; and, as I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend, ſo neceſſary, that, without a good Degree of it, no Man ought to chuſe, and devote himſelf to, a military Life. And for it GOD is to be praiſed, as well as for the Strength and Activity of our Bodies, or the rational Endowments of our Minds; and the Soldier is to maintain it by a vertuous Life, <hi>temperate in all Things</hi>; and he that, by intemperate Practices and a ſoft effeminate Courſe of Living, deſtroys it, is no leſs culpable than he that weakens his Reaſon with Wine.</p>
            <p>But as it it a <hi>chriſtian Grace,</hi> it is the Reſult of the Reaſonings of our own Minds upon the Word of Truth, the great Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sanctification, under the Influences of the holy Spirit. It ſprings from a Senſe of our Obligations to GOD, from a Love to his Commands, from a Fear of his Diſpleaſure, from the Hopes of his Rewards, and from the Baſeneſs of being affrighted by any Conſideration whatſoever from the Duty which we owe him.</p>
            <p>It is this which diſtinguiſhed the Fortitude of <hi>David</hi> from that of the Lion and the Bear. And being built upon religious Principles, like them is uniform and invariable. It is not merely a Fluſh of Spirits, appearing only in the Heat of Action; but is indeed moſt illuſtrious when thoſe Fluids are at the loweſt Ebb. A Proſpect of Glory may give a Spring to the Spirits, to which the Honour of a great Day may be chiefly to be aſcribed. But when in Adverſity all Things conſpire to depreſs Nature and ſink the Heart, then in our Patience to poſſeſs our Souls, to put our Truſt in GOD and hope againſt Hope, and betray no Meanneſs of Thought by any Action unworthy our Character, exhibits the Glory of Courage in the ſtrongeſt Light. And I add, it is remarkable that ſome of the greateſt Heroes which the World hath produced, have been formed to act with Succeſs and Applauſe, in the moſt exalted Stations, by proceeding Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings. This was the Caſe of <hi>David,</hi> the <hi>Man of War</hi> in our Text. And thus an Hero of our own, WILLIAM the third of glorious Memory, to which we owe much of the Succeſſion
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005470_0016_1018387475949938"/>
of the Crown in the illuſtrious Houſe of <hi>Hanover,</hi> by a Series of Calamities was prepared to be the Deliverer of <hi>Europe</hi> from the graſping Deſigns of a neighbouring ambitious <hi>Monarch</hi>; and by his Preſence of Mind, the Wiſdom of his Conduct, and his perſevering Conſtancy in a Courſe of ill Succeſs, had a juſter Claim to the Title of THE GREAT, than he that had it.</p>
            <p>But if it be true that a State of Suffering exhibits the Grace of Fortitude in the faireſt and ſtrongeſt Light, we may behold it in the higheſt Perfection if we look into our BIBLES, upon the Life and Death of JESUS, <hi>the Captain of our Salvation</hi>; who was <hi>a Man of Sorrows and acquainted with Griefs</hi>; whoſe Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtancy was not to be ſhaken by a Proſpect of Sufferings which Language cannot deſcribe; but <hi>who, for the Joy that was ſet before him, endured the Croſs and deſpiſed the Shame, and is ſet down at the right Hand of the Throne of GOD.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Heb. 12.2.</note> And, it is particularly to be noted, He is ſaid to be qualified by Sufferings for the great Undertaking of leading the Sons of GOD to Glory; in Conſequence of which, he was himſelf crowned with Glory and Honour. <note n="*" place="bottom">Heb. 2.10.</note>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. <hi>Clemency</hi> is to be conſidered as another <hi>chriſtian Grace,</hi> and a very uſeful Qualification, and great Ornament to a Soldier. It is an humane benevolent Diſpoſition towards all Men, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clining to Kindneſs and Favour, where there is Room to beſtow them. It is the offspring of thoſe Commands in the Goſpel, <hi>Love one another, Love your Enemies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In ſome Reſpects it hath the Advantage of Strength or For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude. By theſe indeed Armies are beaten, Caſtles taken, and the Bodies of Men fettered in Chains of Subjection: But Cle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mency ſeizeth the Soul, wins over the Affections to your Side, and ſubjects the conquered to your Service upon Principles never to be diſſolved. It is the diſtinguiſhing Spirit of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and like it's divine Author conquers it's Oppoſers by Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of Love; while Fortitude like <hi>Moſes</hi> effects it's Deſigns by the Methods of Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:005470_0017_1018387615DD7D08"/>Great Conqueſts have been made by this Vertue: And in ſearching into the Hiſtories of former Times to acquaint our ſelves with the Polices of War, you will find Inſtances of thoſe that, even after repeated Victories, could never compleat their Conqueſts but by Clemency. An Hero then ſeems at the Top of his Wiſhes, when, having ſurmounted the greateſt Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, he ſubdues his Enemy and pardons him at his Feet. He triumphs for a double Victory gotten at the ſame Time, over his Enemy, and over himſelf. And to deny himſelf the Pleaſure of Revenge, where the Affronts received have been very great, is often the harder Taſk.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The <hi>Fear of GOD</hi> is another Grace very ornamental and beneficial to a Soldier: Criticks, as I remember, have given us this as an Inſtance of the Sublime, <hi>I fear my GOD, I fear none but him.</hi> Sublimity in Sentiment, by being interwoven in the Habits of the Mind, and produced into Practice, forms the Hero. And it is as neceſſary that he fear GOD as that he fear none but him. And you may obſerve, they that have been ſo deſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tute of this Principle as even to dare to aſpire at being deifted themſelves, have anon diſcovered leſs of the <hi>Man,</hi> and more of the <hi>Brute</hi> and the <hi>Devil,</hi> than the vileſt Part of their Fellow-Creatures; whileſt others under the Influence of it, and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly our religious Warriour in the Text, have not only had the Applauſe of their own Time, which Flattery often gives, but the Praiſes of unprejudiced Poſterity.</p>
            <p>This Principle, <hi>David</hi> tells us, was taught him by GOD himſelf. <hi>The GOD of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſaid, the Rock of</hi> Iſrael <hi>ſpake to me; he that ruleth over Men muſt be juſt ruling in the Fear of GOD; And he ſhall be as the Light of the Morning when the Sun riſeth, even a Morning without Clouds; as the tender Graſs ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Earth by clear Shining after the Rain.</hi> 
               <note place="bottom">2 Sam. 23.3.4.</note> And under the Influences of it you find him in all Circumſtances. If he enterpriſeth a great Action, it is in the Fear of GOD; if he comes off with Victory and Honour, ſtill it is in the Fear of GOD and his Goodneſs; or if he fall into Adverſity, the Fear of GOD occaſions Self Examination, Humiliation and Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:005470_0018_1018387AB2E44E18"/>
and opens a Door of Hope in the GOD of his Salvation.</p>
            <p n="4">4. <hi>Loyalty</hi> is a very neceſſary Vertue in a Soldier. Subjec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the higher Powers is an <hi>apoſtolick</hi> Precept, and binds the Soldier's Conſcience. The ſame Text that bids us <hi>Fear GOD</hi> adds <hi>honour the King.</hi> 
               <note n="†" place="bottom">1 Pet. 2.17.</note> He then that rebels againſt his Sovereign, that unſheathes the Sword which he put into his Hands, and turns the Point againſt him, tho' upon the loudeſt Calls of PRIVATE Intereſt or Revenge, breaks the ſtrongeſt Ties of Conſcience and Chriſtianity. And if the Degrees of moral Vertue are to be eſtimated by the good or Miſchief they do in the World, Diſloyalty in a Soldier muſt be accounted a Sin of the firſt Magnitude. This is the Root of that juſtly dreaded Evil, a civil War. And if the Connection between them were ſhewn, and the conſequent Tragedies and continual Horrors deſcribed without any Exaggrevation, no Man of any Conſideration but would tremble to remember he had ever entertained a diſloyal Tho't in his Heart.</p>
            <p>Often there is in Diſloyalty ſuch Ingratitude as is utterly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conſiſtent with <hi>true Honour.</hi> The rebellious Soldier is one that hath lived upon his Sovereign's Bread and worn his Honours; and therefore, barely from the Ingratitude of his Actions, if he had lived at <hi>Athens,</hi> he would, by the Law of the Land, have been reduced to the ignominious State of a Slave; or amongſt the <hi>Macedonians,</hi> puniſhed with Death.</p>
            <p>Nor let it be imagined, there is any Thing criminal in the Life and Character of <hi>David</hi> upon this Head. It is true, the injurious Treatment of his Prince, and his Deſign upon his Life drove him into the Wilderneſs for his Security. But notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding all the Wrongs he had to complain of in the deareſt concerns, and the continual Danger of Death in which he lived, he never enterprized any Thing againſt his Crown or Life; but generouſly diverted the Purpoſe of another againſt the latter, chooſing rather to leave the Redreſs of his Wrongs to that GOD, at whoſe Tribunal all the Kings of the Earth muſt appear like common Men, than to make himſelf a Judge and Revenger in
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:005470_0019_1018387CF7128E78"/>
his own Cauſe againſt his Sovereign. <note n="*" place="bottom">1 Sam. 26.8.</note> The Part which <hi>David</hi> acted was no other than that of a Man conſcious of his own Integrity, perſecuted by a tyrannical Prince, and flying from the many unmerited Deaths that purſued him. — But I forget I am diſcourſing to New-Engliſh Soldiers, whoſe Affection to the Houſe of <hi>Hanover,</hi> and Loyalty to his preſent Majeſty are ſo firmly ſecured, that to ſay much upon this Head, may be tho't very needleſs. My Excuſe, if it needs any, muſt be, the Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction I take in ſpeaking upon this Subject convinceth me of the Pleaſure with which I ſhould be heard, if I could do it any Juſtice.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>Love of One's Country</hi> is another Vertue well becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a <hi>Soldier.</hi> Every Member of the Body politick hath a proper Office aſſigned it; and the meaner ones are not without their Uſefulneſs. <hi>The Eye cannot ſay to the Head, I have no need of thee</hi>; nor again, <hi>the Hand to the Foot, I have no need of you.</hi> 
               <note n="‡" place="bottom">1 Cor. 12.21.</note> While the Merchant and the Huſbandman ſupply the Soldier with foreign or domeſtic Proviſions, for the Support and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of his Life, he, in his Turn, ſecures them in their Poſſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, by his military Skill and Courage. <hi>The whole Body fitly joined together, is compacted by that which every Joint ſupplieth</hi>; and every Part, exerting its proper Influence, <hi>makes an Increaſe of the Body,</hi> building it ſelf up in the mutual Love and Care of all the Members. <note n="†" place="bottom">Eph. 4.16.</note> Love is the Union of the whole Body, directing its various Powers to the ſame End. All the Endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours of the Community to promote its own Welfare, take their Riſe from the Love of one's Country, as Self-Love in every Man is the Principle of Self-Preſervation.</p>
            <p>It is therefore no leſs abſurd and monſtrous, for a Man to entertain a Spirit of Enmity againſt his Country, than to be a Self-Hater. And for a Soldier to employ his military Powers to oppreſs and ruin his Country, is for one Hand to cut off the other, and then deſtroy the whole Body.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:005470_0020_10183881834B52A0"/>The ſacred Scriptures give us many noble Inſtances of this Paſſion. And the Enemy ſeemed to know the Power of it in vertuous Minds, when, to aggravate the Senſe of Miſery in the People of GOD, they required them to ſing one of <hi>Zion</hi>'s Songs. <hi>How ſhall we ſing,</hi> ſaith the Pſalmiſt, <hi>the Lord's Song in a ſtrange Land. If I forget thee, O</hi> Jeruſalem, <hi>let my right Hand for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her Cunning. If I do not remember thee, let my Tongue cleave to the Roof of my Mouth; if I prefer not</hi> Jeruſalem <hi>above my chief Joy.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>It was a Love to their Country, a mighty Affection to the happy Privileges which GOD had given them, that ſpirited ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the Captivity to leave the Poſſeſſions which they had gained in foreign Lands, and return thro' very great Diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements, to the Land of their Fore-fathers Nativity; whilſt many others of leſs Courage, or more Love to their worldly Acquiſitions, contented themſelves to enjoy their religious Privileges in the beſt Manner they could amongſt the Heathen. But in none doth this Grace appear with greater Advantage, than in <hi>Nehemiah,</hi> tho' born and educated in a ſtrange Land. The great Honour he had in the <hi>Perſian</hi> Court might have prevail'd with another to have neglected the ruinous State of his Country, and the Wall of <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> ſtill broken down in many Places, and conſequently expoſed continually to the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roads and Inſults of their Enemies. But the Uſe he made of it was to ſecure the Favour of the Monarch for his People, and to be ſent into <hi>Judea,</hi> with a Commiſſion to rebuild the Walls and Gates of that City. A great Example this, and what de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves often to be tho't upon by a religious Soldier, that he preſerve in himſelf a Love to his Country, and an Affection to its Privileges, civil and religious. For no Men are more likely to be a Bleſſing to their People, by preſerving and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending them, or a Blaſt, by deſerting and deſtroying them: In their Hand is the Sword to preſerve or deſtroy.</p>
            <p n="6">6. <hi>Obedience to Superiours,</hi> is another Vertue very neceſſary for <hi>Soldiers.</hi> This is a Duty of great Importance to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity;
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:005470_0021_101810A4089697D8"/>
and the Neglect of it is the Inlet to Anarchy and Confuſion. No State, no Church can ſubſiſt long without it; and the Succeſs of our Arms is neceſſarily connected with it.</p>
            <p>If every private Soldier was firſt to be ſatisfied of the Wiſdom of his Officer's Command before he moved, he would often be reaſoning when he ſhould be fighting; and in the mean Time Opportunities would be loſt, which could no more be recalled than the Moment in which they preſented themſelves.</p>
            <p>Neither are the greateſt Dangers to be regarded, in Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition to a Superiour's Command. When the religious Soldier firſt entred upon his Calling, he devoted his Life to the Service of his GOD, his King and Country. To riſk it then, when commanded, is the very Thing he came out for: <hi>Duty</hi> is to be conſidered and not <hi>Danger.</hi> If he returns, he comes back with Honour and Satisfaction, and ſtands fair for Preferment: If he falls, he dies greatly, and in a Manner not undeſireable; and <hi>his Memory ſhall be bleſſed.</hi> He dies in the Bed of true Honour, which is better than that of a Fever.</p>
            <p>And as a moſt ready and ſtrenuous Obedience is of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Importance in the Time of Action, it is alſo of great Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity in the Time of Inſtruction. I am ſorry there is any reaſon to complain, the little Reſpect, which is paid to Officers in ſome Country Towns in the Diſcharge of their Duty, is to be aſſigned as one Reaſon of the little Proficiency made by military Exerciſes. Whether this Fault be ſo general as to have been obſerved by thoſe that have gone before me, I know not. But that it is common enough to juſtify this Remark, I make no Doubt. And I am perſuaded the great Liberty of Speech which Soldiers take in the Field before their Officers, and even in the Time of Exerciſe, ſometimes in an unmannerly good Humour, at other Times in angry Reſentment, is an Evil that needs greatly to be reformed. And it becomes them to be ſubject, if <hi>not for Wrath,</hi> yet, <hi>for Conſcience ſake.</hi> And this minds me to ſay,</p>
            <p n="7">7. Laſtly, A <hi>teachable Spirit</hi> is a neceſſary Qualification in a Soldier. It is ſo in acquiring Knowledge and Skill in any Art; and no Man can expect to excell in military Skill without it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:005470_0022_1018388A23CFB1B0"/>Inſtead therefore of bringing to military exerciſes an idle, careleſs, or ludicrous Spirit, they ſhould be attended with a Deſire and Deſign to learn the Duty of a Soldier, and become expert in the Handling of Arms. He that is convinced that this Kind of Skill is neceſſary to accompliſh him for the Defence of his Country, ought to account the Time of military Exerciſes too precious to be trifled away. And I am perſuaded, if Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers came to them with an Appetite to the Skill that is to be acquired by them, and a conſcientious Diſpoſition to make the beſt Improvement of them for that End, few as they are, they would be greatly ſerviceable.</p>
            <p>But as few if any Arts are arrived at ſuch Perfection as to be uncapable of receiving Improvement from the ingenious and induſtrious, a Genius will not content it ſelf to learn only what hath been taught before; but will be ambitious of adorning his Art with new Additions of Knowledge, or a better manner of performing it. Soldiers, I preſume, are not ſubject to a Spirit of Bigotry; and if any new Methods ſhould be found out more beautiful and expeditious than what had been in uſe, I ſuppoſe a Fondneſs for old Practices would hardly prevent their being laid aſide for new that are better. <hi>Uzziah</hi> King of <hi>Judah,</hi> a Prince of a warlike Genius, is mentioned with Honour in the ſacred Scriptures for the great Improvements he made in the <hi>Art of War.</hi> You read, <note n="†" place="bottom">2 Chron. 26.14, 15.</note> 
               <hi>He prepared for them thro' out all the Hoſt Shields, and Spears, and Helmets, and Habergeons, and Bows, and Slings to caſt Stones. And he made in Jeruſalem Engines in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented by cunning Men to be upon the Towers and upon the Bulwarks to ſhoot Arrows and great Stones withal: And his Name ſpread far abroad, for he was marvelouſly helped till he was ſtrong.</hi> 
               <note n="*" place="bottom">I am very ſenſible ſeveral other Vertues, have an equal claim to be conſidered as the Soldiers peculiar Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment and Glory; but the Deſire I had, not to exceed the expected Limits of theſe Diſcourſes, cauſed me to omit them.</note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:005470_0023_1018388D19590F38"/>To ſum up all, this is the religious Turn of Mind, and ſuch as theſe the <hi>Chriſtian Graces</hi> which are the Accompliſhment and Glory of a Soldier. Indeed they are ſo of Men of every Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition, and in every Relation which they ſuſtain. They ſhine equally in the Cabinet as the Camp, they are the Glory of the State and of the Church, of a Community and every Member of it. It is the <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> which <hi>exalteth a Nation,</hi> and it's Oppoſite the <hi>Sin which is the Reproach of any People.</hi> The an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient <hi>Spartans</hi> were ſo ſenſible of the Power of theſe Vertues, that they tho't Walls and Fortifications unneceſſary for the Security of a valiant People.

            <p>And, what is greatly to be regarded, it is to ſuch Perſons, to ſuch Armies, and to ſuch a State and People, that the encour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aging Promiſes of the Protection and Preſence of GOD are made in his Word. Agreably you read in the Prophet, <hi>He that walketh righteouſly and ſpeaketh uprightly, he that deſpiſeth the Gain of the Oppreſſor, that ſhaketh his Hands from holding of Bribes, that ſtoppeth his Ears from hearing of Blood, and ſhutteth his Eyes from ſeeing Evil: He ſhall dwell on high: His Place ſhall be the Muni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Rocks, Bread ſhall be given him, his Waters ſhall be ſure.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Let me now inforce what I have been ſaying to Men of the MILITARY ORDER, and then I ſhall conclude.</p>
            <p>There are two Things which it hath been my Deſign to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend in this Diſcourſe. One is, a religious Dedication of
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:005470_0024_1018388EED8605B0"/>
our ſelves to GOD, made with the utmoſt Seriouſneſs and Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, ariſing from a real and influential Conviction of the Truths of the Goſpel, made in our Minds by the Word and Spirit of GOD. And the other is, the Conſideration and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of thoſe <hi>Chriſtian Graces,</hi> which will be the peculiar Ornament of a <hi>Chriſtian Soldier.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The firſt is certainly of the greateſt Conſequence to the Man, whoſe Calling it is to hazard his Life for his King and Country. If to die well be of infinitely the greateſt Concern to every Man, it eſpecially becomes thoſe to be prepared for Death, whoſe Buſineſs in Life lies upon the very Margin of the Grave. The Uncertainty of Death, how little ſoever it is heeded, is an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anſwerable Argument with every one to a ſpeedy Repentance; but it ſtrengthens with every Man in Proportion to the peculiar Hazard his Life is incident to.</p>
            <p>It is not, my Brethren, a <hi>Profeſſion of Chriſtianity</hi> by Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſm, or any other Ordinance; it is not a mere <hi>Form of Godli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,</hi> and a <hi>Name to live,</hi> while in Heart and Life we are dead to the Belief and Practice of the Goſpel, which I am now re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commending: But an Apprehenſion of the Importance of ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual and everlaſting Things, and an Heart formed to all the vertuous Purpoſes of the <hi>chriſtian Life,</hi> with a juſt Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of all Sin, and an anſwerably vertuous and heavenly Life and Converſation.</p>
            <p>This only can make Death ſafe, and juſtify any Man in devoting himſelf to a Life of Dangers. By this, that <hi>Fortitude of Spirit,</hi> which is a <hi>chriſtian Vertue,</hi> is diſtinguiſhed from the <hi>Raſhneſs</hi> of him, that, tho'tleſs of the future, ruſheth like the Horſe into the Battle. And without this, <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nuine Parent of true Courage, would only ſerve to beget in Men, Terrors that would utterly unfit them for Action. For, I make no Doubt, the Goſpel of Chriſt, believ'd, but not obey'd, would diſhearten the Soldier in the Day of Battle, (if he had any juſt Apprehenſion of his guilty Condition) and give the heathen Stranger to the Doctrines of everlaſting Miſery in the future World, a great Advantage over him. And finally, by this the Favour of GOD is ſecured, who <hi>covereth the Head in
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005470_0025_101838909D3C0240"/>
the Day of Battle,</hi> and crowneth the Soldier with Succeſs and Victory.</p>
            <p>Such Conſiderations as theſe, were they duly entertained, would have a peculiar Influence upon every Man that ſuſtains a military Character.</p>
            <p>But beſides this, you have heard, it is incumbent upon the religious Soldier, to maintain and cheriſh in himſelf, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Graces of the chriſtian Life, as the peculiar Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhment and Ornament of a military Man. Every Soldier, examining himſelf, ſhould make an Eſtimate, in part, of his Qualifications for a military Life, by the Strength of ſuch gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Habits within him, and the Conſtancy and Uniformity of their Operations in his Life. And in accompliſhing himſelf for his Calling, while, with much Pains and Diligence in <hi>mili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tary Exerciſes,</hi> he perfects himſelf in the <hi>Art of War,</hi> let him by no Means forget to improve himſelf by <hi>moral ones,</hi> ſo very neceſſary to finiſh his Character as a Soldier. This Kind of military Vertue is gained, maintained, and improved by <hi>Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe</hi> as well as the other.</p>
            <p>By frequent Meditation therefore upon the Nature and Tendency of the ſeveral Graces of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> let him acquaint himſelf with the Excellency of that, the <hi>Merchandiſe of which is better than the Merchandiſe of Silver, and the Gain thereof than fine Gold; which is more precious than Rubies, and not to be equalled by all the Things that thou can'ſt deſire.</hi> By Prayer let him engage the ſanctifying Influences of the holy Spirit, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed to them that aſk him of GOD their heavenly Father; and by continual Practice and Watchfulneſs, let every Call of Corruption be conſtantly denied, and every gracious Diſpoſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion exerted, in common Life, as there ſhall be Occaſion. Let him remember, <hi>He that is ſlow to Anger is better than the Mighty, and he that ruleth his Spirit, than he that taketh a City.</hi> Thus, by the daily Repetition of gracious Actions, let him ſtrengthen the Habits of them within himſelf, and improve in the holy Art of living to GOD; that his Heart being eſtabliſhed in Grace, he may know the Uſefulneſs of it in his military Calling.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:005470_0026_10183895D16260E0"/>But it is now Time to come to a Concluſion, and I ſhall do it with an Addreſs to the <hi>Gentlemen</hi> that have called me to the Service this Day.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Gentlemen,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I conſider the ancient and honourable Artillery-Company, as a School of military Inſtruction, diffuſing its Influences into the moſt diſtant Parts of the Province. By your Exerciſes it is, that ſome of our moſt accompliſh'd Soldiers have acquired their excelling Skill in theſe Matters, whereby they have been able to inſtruct others. The Uſefulneſs of your Exerciſes, and military Accompliſhments, is not confined within yourſelves, but is very extenſive.</p>
            <p>This Conſideration, therefore, ought to fix your Aims, and quicken your Endeavours after the higheſt Degrees of Perfection in military Vertue. The Proſpect of Uſeful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is your Argument, and the more Good you have it in your Power to do, the ſtronger it is. This is your End, whether you read in the Study, or practice in the Field; whether you ſearch into the Reaſons of ancient Cuſtoms, or the Practice of the preſent Day; whether you record, from the Hiſtories of former Times for future Uſe, the Stratagems of War, the Policy of which pleaſeth you beſt; or the heroic Sentiments of ſome great Captain that ſtrike you moſt, or any divine Reflections of ſingular Influence upon your military Life. Your End in all theſe Things is the Glory of GOD, and the Service of your King and Country. What Care and Pains then become you to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cell in every illuſtrious Accompliſhment of the Soldier, that by the Force of your Inſtructions and reputable Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample, others may learn of you the ſublimer as well as the more common ones?</p>
            <p>If there be any Time, which, more than other, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires the Accompliſhment of a Soldier, in Perfection, it is now. GOD, who hath been lifting up an Enſign to the Nations, and as a juſt Puniſhment to an ungodly World, ſuffered the Luſts of Men to break forth into Wars and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005470_0027_10183897B2A04808"/>
Fightings, hath, the other Day, cauſed the Alarm of War to be ſounded in our Ears alſo. On one Side, we are in Fears from the Invaſions of exaſperated Powers from afar; and on the other, from the Sword of the Wilderneſs in the Hands of bloody Men, <hi>whoſe tender Mercies are Cruelties.</hi> We have heard with our Ears, and our Fathers have told us, what bloody Tragedies have been acted upon the Stage of <hi>New-England</hi> in their Day; ſuch as, in the Relation, might ſeem rather the Work of Fancy than of a faithful Hiſtorian. And to render our Proſpects the more diſmal, what Grounds have we to fear our Wickedneſs hath made us ripe for the Judgments of an incenſed GOD, and to have the ſame things acted over again?</p>
            <p>It is now no Time for Soldiers to content themſelves with ſhowy Exerciſes and ſplendid Appearances, which like the Lilly, bloom and wither in a Day. The Defence of your Country calls you into the Field, not of Exerciſe, but of Battle. You are to handle your Arms in good earneſt, and <hi>not as one that beats the Air</hi>: You are not now to fence for Exerciſe or Oſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation, but to defend your ſelves; and what is more your Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and drive away the Enemy from the Gates.</p>
            <p>It is high Time therefore that, being the Subjects of Grace and Sanctification, you live in the daily Exerciſe of every <hi>Chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian Vertue</hi>; and by ſuch a Life, accompanied with a careful Self Examination, you had made your <hi>Calling and Election ſure</hi>; and were able to think with Calmneſs and Indifference upon that which is ſo much the dread of all Men, and <hi>thro' Fear</hi> of which ſo many are <hi>all their Life Time ſubject to Bondage.</hi> Sin unrepented of, and unforſaken, is a Thing moſt deſtructive to true Valour, and will be the worſt Enemy in the Day of Battle. And he that is under the Influence of it may well dread Death; and is prepared to run away to his everlaſtidg Infamy, which would be worſe than Death, were it not for what is to follow. <hi>The Wicked flee when no Man purſueth, but the Righteous are bold as a Lion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But on the other Hand, having ſecured the Salvation of your Souls, thro' the Merits of the REDEEMER, you may not only
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005470_0028_1018389A02A56DE0"/>
be fearleſs and undaunted at all the hideous Forms that Death can wear, but even wiſh to die in the Defence of your Country, the greateſt Honour any Man can aſpire to next to, that of dying for the Honour of CHRIST, who firſt died for him; and, what is infinitely more, may be calm as your own Conſciences in that univerſal Ruin, when <hi>the Heavens ſhall be on Fire, and the Ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments ſhall melt with fervent Heat, and the World and the Works of it ſhall be burnt up.</hi> I will conclude all, addreſſing the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Words of the ſame <hi>Apoſtle</hi> to this whole Aſſembly. 2 Pet. 3.11. <hi>Seeing then that all theſe Things ſhall be diſſolved, what manner of Perſons ought ye to be in all holy Converſation and God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs?</hi>
