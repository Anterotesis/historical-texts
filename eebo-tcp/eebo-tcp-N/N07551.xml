            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>Take! Aye Man, by my Faith, three Parts of the City ſeem to approve of it, if their Minds don't change with the next Wind that blows.—Why, Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Zealot, there are Hundreds in Philadelphia tap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping their Neighbours on the Shoulder, and ſaying, It is a prodigious ſharp Thing: Yes it is a very ſmart thing, ſays the other;— Poor Fellows! I didn't once think the Paxton-Boys had ſuch Provocation and Grievances to provoke them to do as they did, but now I don't wonder at them.— I aſſure you our Remon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrance has gain'd us many Proſelytes, and many of the Philadelphians to our Party. Aye, aye, and it is my Opinion, that if the Governor and Aſſembly will not grant all and each of our reaſonable Requirements, and redreſs our many Grievances; I ſay, 'tis my humble Opinion we, by our excellent little Book, ſhall have more than half the Country, as well as three Parts of Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia, to back us when we give them the next Viſit.</p>

               <p>My dear Sir, I mean this, I am not, on ſecond Thoughts, ſo much prejudiced in favour of our little Book as you are, nor perhaps as many of our careleſs giddy Readers; for tho not One in Fifty underſtands what he reads, or ſeeks for Proofs for Propoſitions laid down, neither has Capacity to enter into the Spirit of the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor: Yet there are Men quick-ſighted, both in City and Country, who, I'm afraid, will eaſily diſcern the Fallacy of our Arguments, and the lightneſs of our Matter; and give me leave, Brother Scrivner, as I am a Party, as well as you, in writing this excellent Piece, and expect to be paid as well for it; I ſay give me leave to tell you, that I am not ſo ſanguine as you are, reſpecting it's Succeſs, notwithſtanding our ſeeming reaſonable Remonſtrances, cover'd over with a few tender Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, and thin, very thin Gloſſes; together with Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſitions and Aſſertions without Proof, expreſs'd in bad Engliſh, and here and there in contradictory Terms; and many other Faults, which before they came out of the Preſs, I was not aware of.</p>

               <p>Oh Lud! Oh Lud! Pray good reform'd Sir, have you no more than theſe few Faults to find with your own ſweet Works and my witty Inventions? Oh my Heart! I believe the Man is going Mad! Why Zealot, doſt thou deny thy own Works?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Zeal.</speaker>
               <p>No, Mr Poſitive, I don't deny my own Works; but I am afraid, as the Traytor Syphax once ſaid to Sempronies his chief Captain, in a Caſe paralel with this, <hi>Cato has piercing Eyes, and will diſcern our Frauds, unleſs they're cover'd thick with Art.</hi>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Zeal.</speaker>
               <p>I beg your Pardon Sir, but perhaps this may not be ſo great a Digreſſion as ſhallow Politicians may imagine, and as it ſeems to offend you, I will drop it, and come to the Point at once.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Poſit.</speaker>
               <p>Aye, aye, come to the Point at once; but I ſwear you ſhall never bring me into your Opinion, to
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:009638_0004_0F776C3B6BF65948"/>think that our Declaration and Remonſtrance is either falſe, fooliſh, or impertinent, or that it borders on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion. No, no, Mr. Zealot, ſo far from Rebellion, that I wonder that all the witty Politicians and great Geniuſes in the Province, have not employed their Pens in applauding our never-to-be-forgotten Action at Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter; where we bravely conquer'd, our Eye not pity<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, nor our Hand ſparing either Age or Sex; exulting, as one of our modern Poets ſays, in the Widow's Wail, the Virgin's Shriek, and Infant's trembling Cry.— Oh Zealot! tell me not of Caſſius, Brutus, Caeſar, Pompey, or even Alexander the Great! We! we Pax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton Boys have done more than all, or any of them!

With Sword in Hand, Rifles, Toma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hawks, and other Implements of War? In Truth, if one don't mind what one ſays, a mighty humble Way of praying. I rather think theſe unhappy People ſhould have come with Ropes about their forfeited Necks to ſue, as they call it, for Redreſs of Grievances; or rather, for Pardon of paſt Guilt of ſo black a Nature. For this kind of Conduct we have an extraordinary Precedent in the Firſt Book of <hi>Kings,</hi> Chapter 20th, in which ſome of the Servants or Officers of King <hi>Benhadad</hi> wiſely counſel'd him to act in this Manner, (ſee <hi>Ver.</hi> 32.) <hi>So they girded Sackcloth on their Loins, and put Ropes on their Heads, and came to the King of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and ſaid,</hi> &amp;c. For the reſt I refer you to the whole Paſſage. Now, tho' I confeſs my Warmth, yet I cannot help feeling in my Heart a Tenderneſs and Pity for theſe my deluded Countrymen; and I can truly ſay, I could wiſh to God that they had followed the laudable Example of theſe wiſe diſtreſſed People, the <hi>Syrians</hi> of Old, inſtead of the raſh, inconſiderate Method they ſo violently purſued: For ſee <hi>Verſe</hi> 31, where it is ſaid, <hi>Behold, &amp;c.</hi> I beg, without further Addition, to refer you to the whole Chapter, as nothing in Language can be better adapt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the preſent Purpoſe.</p>
               <p>Now, Gentlemen, by your Leave, for a Remark or two on your Declaration.— <hi>In aſmuch</hi> (ſay you) <hi>as the killing the Indians at Conneſtogo-Manor and Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſter, has been, and may be the Subject of much Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation,</hi> (<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="7" facs="unknown:009638_0007_0F776C3DC5BAEF28"/>to paſs a Conſure ſevere enough upon Rioters and Murderers in cool Blood? Let the Provocations be what they will, every humane tender Heart muſt ſhud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der at, and deteſt both the Facts and the Authors of them: Nor is it poſſible for any, even their neareſt Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, to offer one ſingle Argument of Weight in their Favour. But further; by your own Words, you ſeem to have a Deſign of yet trampling on the Laws of Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, and committing the ſame Thing over again, when a convenient Opportunity offers; elſe what is the Meaning of the Words before mentioned, <hi>on the Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thors of thoſe Facts, and others of the like nature, which may hereafter happen?</hi> Now, what becomes of this humble Praying? In ſhort, it amounts to this, and ought to be read thus, "We the <hi>diſtreſſed,</hi>" or rather, angry <hi>"bleeding,"</hi> or rather "<hi>bloody-minded, revenge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Inhabitants of</hi> Pennſylvania, <hi>do requeſt;</hi>" or ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <q>
                     <hi>inſiſt, to have as many of the now preſent Laws and Acts of Aſſembly aboliſhed, as ſuit not our Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt, or is not agreeable to our Wills; and we will, when, and as ſoon as it ſuits our other Purpoſes, let the Honourable Governor and Aſſembly know our further Pleaſure.</hi>
                  </q>—You farther ſay, in Page 3, <hi>We think it proper, thus openly to declare ourſelves.</hi> And what is this Declaration? Why, that we are not ſorry that we have knowingly and deliberately violated the Laws of Government, <hi>for we do frankly confeſs, that nothing but Neceſſity itſelf could induce us to it.</hi> To what? To down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Rebellion and Murder:—Audacious and horrid Confeſſion indeed! And then call it a <hi>ſeeming,</hi> or <hi>bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an Appearance of flying in the Face of Government and Authority!</hi>— But how eaſy is it for any one that is not prejudiced in your Favour, to ſee through ſuch thin Gloſſes and mean Sophiſtry? In Line 18, you ſay, <hi>And is attended with much Labour, Fatigue and Expence.</hi> O dear! This is neither new nor ſtrange! — When was it ever known that an angry, giddy, violent and revengeful People, firſt ſat down and counted the Coſt, or would be perſuaded to ſtop their mad Career, till their Folly had run them aground, and brought them
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:009638_0008_0F776C3E6F98B910"/>to a too late Repentance? But as I can only touch up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Things, I ſhall conclude this Head with telling you, that if ſuch an Affair had happen'd in <hi>England,</hi> it would have brought your Leaders to the common Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows, or to have had the Honour of a new one erected on Pupoſe for them; and your poor deluded Followers, to Tranſportation for Life.—Now, Gentlemen, I will for Brevity's Sake, omit taking Notice of thoſe ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diculous uncertain Stories of a certain injured Society in this City, as they appear to be without any Proof, Weight or Signification.— If even they could be proved, this could be no Excuſe for Rebellion, Sedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Murder, putting a whole City in a Panic, and the Country in an Uproar and Surprize.—But what can you poſſibly mean by your notable Harangue, in Page 9? <hi>And can it be thought ſtrange</hi> (ſay you) <hi>that a Scene of ſuch Treatment at this Time, and now adding at this critical Juncture to all our former Diſtreſſes, the diſagreeable Burden of ſupporting in the very Heart of the Province, at ſo great an Expence, between one and two Hundred Savages, to the great Diſquietude of the Majority of the good Inhabitants of this Province,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And muſt not</hi> (ſay you) <hi>all well-diſpoſed People entertain a charitable Sentiment of thoſe, who, at their own great Expence and Trouble, have attempted, or ſhall yet attempt, to reſcue a labouring Land from a Weight ſo oppreſſive, unreaſonable and unjuſt? It is this we deſign, it is this we are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved to proſecute; tho' it is with great Reluctance, we are obliged to adapt a Meaſure not ſo agreable as could be deſired and to which Extremity alone compels.</hi>— Pray, Gentlemen, what do you mean by <hi>ſupporting at a great Expence, between one and two Hundred Savages, to your great Diſquietude,</hi> &amp;c.?</p>

               <p>Alas, Sir! how ſtrangely miſtaken are you, as well as many Hundreds more, whom I've heard ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs themſelves in this random Way; either not know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, or not diſtinguiſhing, between Savage Indians, Heathen Indians, and Chriſtian Indians. — Now, Gentlemen, through the tender Mercy of their and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:009638_0009_0F776C404B52D590"/>your Creator, who is one God over all, bleſſed for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more; I ſay, through him, whoſe tender Mercies are over all his Works, and before whoſe Eye the Colour of the Skin is nothing, hath been pleaſed in his bound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs Compaſſion, to ſend Goſpel Miniſters amongſt them, and theſe few, out of the many Thouſands in <hi>America,</hi> have embraced and receiv'd the joyful Report of the Goſpel: And further, they have, after believing in JESUS, been baptized in his Name, and into his Death, who is both their Lord and ours. And again, many of theſe Savages, as they are called, have, and do yet, partake of the Lord's Supper, or Holy Communion; and 'tis not only a Pleaſure, but Aſtoniſhing, when one converſes with them, to find how well grounded they are in the Principles and Doctrines of the Old and New Teſtaments, and our reform'd Religion.—One Thing more I would obſerve, which to me, is a ſtronger Proof yet, of their being rooted and grounded in the Living Power and Faith of the Goſpel; and that is, at the Time of the late Tumult, when moſt of the People be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that the Rioters from the Frontiers had their Eye chiefly againſt them, to cut them off from the Land of the Living, both Root and Branch; yet through the Time of this deep Calamity, their ſerene Looks and quiet Deportment, plainly indicated an upright Heart, and a Mind at eaſe; and this even in the View of an approaching and untimely Death, by wicked and cruel Hands, already ſtain'd with Human Blood. I myſelf have viſited them two or three Times in their preſent Exile, and have always found them to be free, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſant, calm and unruffled, <hi>Like a Summer's Sea, when not a Breath of Wind flies o'er its Surface.</hi>

               <p>Well Mr. Poſitive, ſince it offends you ſo much, I will drop this Subject of our Diſcourſe, and come to a Concluſion, as you harden your Mind againſt Conviction, and obſtinately refuſe Reproof. Therefore, a few Remarks more, and I have done; as to the great Expence you complain of, are not you yourſelves the abſolute Cauſe of it? Is it not to the Horror of the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment? And did not you oblige them to take thoſe diſtreſſed People under their fatherly Protection, to ſave a conſiderable Number from Deſtruction? And where could they be ſafer than here, from the Fury and Rage of an incenſed, riotous and lawleſs Mob? You are the laſt that ſhould complain of this Expence, as you your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves are the Occaſion of it. And further, the Neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity of keeping them here, evidently appears from your inſolent and daring Confeſſion in the four laſt Lines of your Declaration: <hi>It is this</hi> (you ſay) <hi>we deſign, it is this we are reſolv'd to proſecute, &amp;c.</hi>— Yes, yes, if we may judge of your future, by your late treaſonable Conduct, we may take your Word for it, without ſwearing to it: And, to make Uſe of your own Words above, <hi>Will not the good Inhabitants of this Province, and all well-diſpoſed People, awaken to Reſentment, and put themſelves in Readineſs to repel, if fair Argument won't do; I ſay, repel Force to Force, and ſeverely chaſtiſe ſuch lawleſs Rioters;</hi> who, in the Concluſion of their Threatenings and Demands pretend to ſay, though in Contradiction to their Actions, GOD SAVE THE KING. —What unprejudiced impartial Man, after a delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Reflection on all they have done and ſaid, will view their <hi>Declaration</hi> in any other Light than a ſophiſtical Piece of Irony, artfully inſinuating into the Minds of the Ignorant and Vulgar, that they are, as they ſay in ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Place, <hi>attach'd to the Perſon and Reign of our dear Sovereign King George the Third?</hi>— Is not their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct too much like that notorious wicked Traytor who at the Head of a tumultuous Mob, came up to his Lord with a <hi>Hail Maſter,</hi> and kiſſed him?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Zeal</speaker>
               <p>Pray, good Sir, when was it ever known that we Proteſtant Diſſenters diſcover'd an angry perſecut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Spirit? We are indeed a very zealous People, and we think it our Duty to be ſo; beſides, if I remember right, I have either read or heard that our Fore-fathers have ſuffer'd and been perſecuted for this ſame good Cauſe, namely, for being <hi>Preſbyterians.</hi>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Lovell.</speaker>
               <p>Very well, Sir, I will allow the latter Part of your Argument, it is true: At the Time when a Paper War was carried on, and libelling between <hi>Conformiſt</hi> and <hi>Non-conformiſt</hi> prevailed, your Predeceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſors and Fore-fathers did ſuffer a good many Things, and ſtood it out bravely: I believe alſo, that there was many great and good Men who became of that Sect, and were an Honour to the Religion they profeſs'd.— But alas how is the Scene changed? The Crown is fallen from your Heads; or, as one of your own Poets elegantly expreſſes it,— <hi>Happy the Times; but ah! thoſe Times are gone, when wond'rous Power and radiant Grace round the tall Arches of the Temple ſhone,</hi> &amp;c. &amp;c. Indeed in theſe Times when <hi>Non-conformiſts</hi> were but comparitively few in Number, and were a Laughing-Stock to others, then, and for many Years after, true Religion, Zeal, and a Spirit of Love, prevailed glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly: But when they became more numerous, and the Miniſters and People more rich, they began to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire after worldly Power and Greatneſs, their Godly Zeal abated, and in its Stead grew up Bigotry, Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtition and Party-Zeal; and by Degrees, the ſame bitter perſecuting Spirit by which their Fore-fathers were per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted took Place in them, and continues more or leſs unto this Day: From hence it is, they are divided and ſub-divided into ſo many Sects and Parties, every one
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:009638_0013_0F776C4430DFC7A0"/>thinking themſelves moſt Orthodox, and condemning and charging their Diſſenting Brethren with Error Hereſy and Schiſm, who don't jump into each of their Opinions. — For the Proof of this we need not go beyond the Seas; even in this City it is too glaringly manifeſt, by the inteſtine Broils and Schiſms that have lately happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſo that not the meek and peaceful Spirit of the great Founder of <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> prevails, but unhappily a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of a very contrary Nature; though we are expreſsly told in ſacred Writ, that where Contention is, there is every evil Work. 'Tis grievous to ſee what Heat and Bitterneſs ſubſiſts in the Breaſts of many PRESBYTERI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ANS in this Town, as well as in the Country, againſt the People called QUAKERS.— It truely ſeems as if ſome make it their Study, as well as Boaſt, to aſperſe, vilify and blacken the fair Character they have generally maintained for ſo many Years in all Places throughout the Chriſtian World, where there are any of that Socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty living.—And let me further obſerve here, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme ſevere and cruel Treatment theſe People met with in <hi>New England,</hi> where they not only endured cruel Mockings and Scourgings, but Impriſonment, and even Death, for CHRIST's Sake.— Let us not recount the Cruelty of PAPISTS, when even DISSEN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TERS have been guilty of perſecuting <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up their Meetings for publick Worſhip, plundering their Houſes, hauling Men and Women to Priſon, ſtrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping, whipping and cutting off their Ears, baniſhing, and at laſt, hanging them, <hi>till they,</hi> as their cruel Judges uſed often to expreſs it, <hi>till they were dead.</hi>

For Shame, ſuffer your Eyes to be open'd, and your Hearts to become affected to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards theſe poor ſuffering Exiles, and begrudge them not that ſcanty Pittance allow'd them by our good Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor and Aſſembly for their preſent Subſiſtance.— I mention this, becauſe I have heard many with ill tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Heat, Zeal and Ill-nature, expreſs great Diſſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction againſt the Government for this very kind and benevolant Act of Charity, at this Juncture become ſo abſolutely neceſſary and unavoidable, and which, I doubt not, our gracious and bountiful LORD takes No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of, and will reward an hundred Fold, ſince a Cup of Water given in his Name, ſhall not go unnoticed by him, tho' beſtow'd on the leaſt or pooreſt of his Fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowers.</p>

Let me conclude, my dear Fellow Mortals, with this excellent Advice from Scripture, <hi>Be careful leſt you be found Fighters againſt GOD, calling Light Darkneſs and Darkneſs Light, putting Good for Evil and Evil for Good.</hi>
