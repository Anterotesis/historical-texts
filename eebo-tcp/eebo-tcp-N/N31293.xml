            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <p>And he took a Child, and ſet him in the midſt of them: and when he had taken him in his Arms, he ſaid unto them, Whoſoever ſhall receive one of ſuch Children in my Name, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiveth me; and whoſoever ſhall receive me, receiveth not me, but him that ſent me.</p>

            <p>
               <hi>DOCT.</hi> Chriſt takes Notice of little Children, and loves them dearly, if they be good Children.</p>
            <p>Your Parents don't love you a thouſandth Part ſo much (nor you yourſelves) as Chriſt does, if you be good Children.</p>
            <p>Firſt Propoſition. <hi>Jeſus Chriſt takes Notice of all little Children.</hi> He obſerved you, before you came hither, and as you were in coming: And he takes Notice of you now while you are here. If any of you are <hi>weary,</hi> and want to be gone Home, or to get out to Play, Chriſt obſerves it. He minds who are <hi>affected</hi> with the Sermon, and who are not; who they are that are <hi>careleſs,</hi> and don't mind what is ſaid; and eſpecially if any are ſo wicked as to <hi>play,</hi> while they ſhould be hearing. He takes No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice how you behave yourſelves <hi>at Home</hi>: Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are dutiful to your Parents, &amp; loving to your Brothers and Siſters; or whether you be diſobedient and fretful, rude, or quarrelſome. He minds what you ſay and do when you are <hi>Abroad,</hi> and as you are going to <hi>School.</hi> He
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:041399_0004_101A7EDEA17BD2B8"/>
ſees how you ſpend the <hi>Saturday Night,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are willing to ſay your Catechiſm; and on <hi>Sabbath Day Morning,</hi> how you ſpend your Time, whether you get alone, and read and think and pray; or are idle, and do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, or play, which is worſe; and what you do <hi>all Day.</hi> You read (Mal. 3.16) <hi>The</hi> LORD <hi>hearkened and heard, and a Book of Remembrance was written before him.</hi> He ſets down in his Book, all that you ſay, and do, and think, when you are <hi>alone,</hi> and when in <hi>Company,</hi> and <hi>where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever</hi> you are. It appears that Jeſus Chriſt takes Notice of all Children.</p>
            <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe he is every where preſent.</hi> As <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks in the Beginning of the Hundred and thirty-ninth Pſalm; <hi>O Lord thou haſt ſearch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me, &amp; known me. Thou knoweſt my down ſitting and mine up-riſing; thou underſtandeſt my Tho'ts afar off. Thou compaſſeſt my Path, and my lying down; and art acquainted with all my Ways. For there is not a Word in my Tongue, but O Lord, thou knoweſt it altogether. Thou haſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſet me behind and before, and laid thine Hand up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me. Such Knowledge is too wonderful for me; it is high, I cannot attain unto it. Whither ſhall I go from thy Preſence? Or whither ſhall I flee
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:041399_0005_101A7EE10803A6A8"/>
from thy Spirit? If I aſcend up into Heaven, thou art there: If I make my Bed in Hell, behold thou art there. If I take the Wings of the Morning, and dwell in the uttermoſt Parts of the Sea, even there ſhall thy Hand lead me, and thy right Hand ſhall hold me. If I ſay, Surely the Darkneſs ſhall cover me, even the Night ſhall be Light about me. Yea, the Darkneſs hideth not from thee; but the Night ſhineth as the Day; the Darkneſs and the Light are both alike to thee.</hi>—Children, I ſee you now ſitting before me: Your Parents that are at Home, don't ſee you: But Chriſt ſees you <hi>always</hi>; for he is <hi>every where.</hi> The An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels can't be every where; they can't be in two Places at once; but Chriſt can. He knows your <hi>Tho'ts.</hi> He knew a Thouſand Years ago, what you would be thinking of now. He knew how many Times you would wiſh in your Hearts, O that God's Spirit would help the Miniſter in preaching! O that I might get ſome Good to Day! and the like. And he ſets down your Tho'ts in his Book.—He knows all the <hi>Words</hi> you ſpeak, good and bad; and from what <hi>Heart</hi> they come. You can't <hi>underſtand</hi> how he can be every where at once; but he is ſo, he is all over the World, here and
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:041399_0006_101A7EE330E7E5C0"/>
at <hi>Boſton,</hi> and at the fartheſt Part of the Sea; we muſt believe it. He is in Heaven, and in Hell, at the ſame Time; in the Dark, as well as in the Light. He ſees all the <hi>Sins,</hi> that you commit in <hi>ſecret,</hi> and ſets them all down. Yet if you <hi>believe</hi> in Chriſt, and are truly <hi>ſorry</hi> for your Sins, they will be <hi>all blotted out</hi>: But your <hi>good</hi> Tho'ts, Words, and Actions will be ſet down, and never blotted out. There is Room enough in his Book, to ſet down all the good Things done by you; more Room than there would be in this great Bible, if it were all clean Paper.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Good Children,</hi> you are Chriſt's Diſciples, his Scholars; and he <hi>knows</hi> that you love him. It may be your <hi>Parents</hi> don't know that you love Jeſus Chriſt; but he knows it. When you pray alone, you may ſay as <hi>Peter</hi> did, <hi>Lord thou knoweſt all Things, thou knoweſt that I love thee.</hi> And if Chriſt knows <hi>all Things,</hi> then be ſure he always obſerves <hi>little Children.</hi> In the ninth of <hi>Matthew,</hi> and the fourth Verſe<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 'tis ſaid, <hi>Jeſus knowing their Tho'ts ſaid, Why think ye Evil in your Hearts?</hi> He obſerves every particular Child. There was one <hi>Nathanael,</hi> once<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that uſed to go alone, under a Tree to pray; and
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:041399_0007_101A7EE61FB0D2D0"/>
Chriſt <hi>ſaw</hi> him, and told him of it. He did not then think, Chriſt could <hi>ſee</hi> him, but he did. Some of you love to get alone among the Buſhes to pray; and you did not think it may be, that Chriſt <hi>ſee</hi> you; but he did. Chriſt can ſay, I ſaw you <hi>John,</hi> you <hi>Sarah,</hi> whatever your Name is. I tell you ſo in his Name; and that's all one as if <hi>he</hi> told you ſo. He ſaw you there laſt <hi>Night,</hi> in ſuch a Place <hi>alone,</hi> and this <hi>Morning</hi> in ſuch a Place <hi>alone.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Secondly, <hi>Little Children are committed to him to keep</hi>; and therefore he takes Notice of them. In ſome Places there is a <hi>Shepherd</hi> ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed to <hi>keep</hi> the Sheep. Chriſt is the <hi>good Shepherd.</hi> Your godly Parents are the <hi>Sheep,</hi> and you are the <hi>Lambs.</hi> The Devil is the <hi>Wolf,</hi> that goes to carry you away by his Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; but if you love Chriſt, he will watch over you, to keep you from Satan's Temptations. All the Angels in Heaven could not keep you; but Chriſt can. And he does keep you from a <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> any Harms. You are Chriſt's own little Lambs, and you are now in his <hi>
                  <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                     <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
                  </gap>
               </hi> when you come to Meeting, and he is <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> you with his <hi>Word</hi>: He brought you here <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Purpoſe to <hi>feed</hi> you. How ſweet will this be
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:041399_0008_101A7EE86CA5E6B0"/>
to them that love Chriſt? You are ſome of thoſe <hi>other Sheep</hi> that were not of that Fold of the <hi>Jews,</hi> which Chriſt ſays, <hi>He muſt bring in.</hi> A Shepherd will look after his Sheep. That is ſpoken of Chriſt, in the fortieth of <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and the eleventh: <hi>He ſhall feed his Flock, like a Shepherd; he ſhall gather the Lambs in his Arms, and carry them in his Boſom, and ſhall gently lead thoſe that are with Young.</hi> If there be a <hi>Lamb</hi> that is left behind, or one that is Weak, or Lame, or Sick, and can't go, the <hi>Shepherd</hi> will look after it: So Chriſt will pitty and help you, when you have Souls ſick and wounded by Sin, and can't help yourſelves. When the <hi>Wolf</hi> comes, the Shepherd frights him away: So Chriſt will fright away the <hi>Devil,</hi> when he comes to tempt you, if you commit yourſelves to him, and cry to him, believing and repenting. He has led your good Parents all along; and ſo he will do you that are good Children.</p>
            <p>Thirdly, <hi>If Chriſt did</hi> not <hi>take Notice of little Children, how could he judge them at the laſt Day, as he muſt do?</hi> 'Tis ſaid, <hi>God ſhall judge the Secrets of Men by Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> And <hi>John</hi> in the Revelation, <hi>ſaw the Dead, ſmall and great ſtand before God; and the Books were opened, and the
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:041399_0009_101A7EEAB45260F0"/>
Dead were judged out of thoſe Things which were written in the Books, according to their Deeds.</hi> Now how could he judge the World, if he did not know the Thoughts, Words and Actions of all? How could he ſentence wicked Children to Hell, and good Children to Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, if he had not taken Notice of them all along their Lives? You read in the twelfth of <hi>Ec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cleſiaſtes,</hi> and the fourteenth, <hi>God ſhall bring eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Work into Judgment, with every ſecret Thing, whether it be Good or whether it be Evil.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Uſe of the Doctrine, is for <hi>Warning</hi> to Children. Firſt, Be dutiful Children. Be dutiful to God; be dutiful to your Parents. Be diligent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> at the Work you are ſet about. Love and mind your Book; take all Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities to read. Do all the Good you can. Be quick and faithful, when you are ſent of an Errand. Be ſure don't fail to pray alone, Morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Evening, every Day. Hear what your Saviour ſays, in <hi>Matthew; Thou, when thou prayeſt, enter into thy Cloſet, and pray to thy Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther which is in ſecret; and thy Father which ſeeth in ſecret, ſhall reward thee openly.</hi> Think often about Jeſus Chriſt. It is he that is ſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of in <hi>Iſaiah; To us a Son is born, to us a

Child is given, his Name ſhall be called Wonder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, Councellor, the Mighty God, the everlaſting Father, the Prince of Peace.</hi> Believe that he always ſees you If you can find a Place to Sin in, ſo dark or ſecret, that Chriſt can't ſee you, you may venture to do what you will there, but indeed there is no ſuch Place in all the World. Always remember you muſt have <hi>Help</hi> from him, to do every Duty, and to keep you from Sin. Don't dare to do any Thing alone that is bad, any more than you would here, when we are all looking on you. If you do, Chriſt will ſay to you in the Day of, Judgment, What! were you more afraid of <hi>Men,</hi> than of <hi>Me</hi> your Judge? If your Parents will bear with you in your Wickedneſs, Chriſt will not.—Come to Meeting always when you can; but if you hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen to ſtay at Home, remember that Chriſt ſees you all Day long. If I were to ſtay at Home with you, would you play? But Chriſt is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways there. You can't think one evil Thought, but Chriſt will know it, &amp; all the World will know it in the Day of Judgment. But if you repent and believe in Chriſt, all your <hi>Sins</hi> will be <hi>blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out,</hi> and all the World ſhall know what good Children you have been. All the Good that
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:041399_0011_101A7EEF34CF4D68"/>
ever you did, or ſaid, or thought, will be read before all Angels and Men.</p>
            <p>The ſecond Propoſition is, That Chriſt <hi>loves good Children dearly.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Queſtion. <hi>Who are good Children?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Theſe are ſome of the Marks of good Children: They are afraid to Sin <hi>alone,</hi> and in the <hi>Dark,</hi> as much as if every Body were looking upon them. Such are careful of what they ſpeak, &amp; what they think. Good Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren are glad when <hi>Sabbath</hi> comes, that they may go to Meeting, and hear God's Word. They don't dare to diſobey or mutter at their <hi>Parents,</hi> even, tho' they forbear to correct them for it. They <hi>fear</hi> God, who will puniſh wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Children in Hell. They ſay with themſelves, I had rather my Parents, or any Body, ſhould be angry with me, than God ſhould. 'Tis the <hi>Fear</hi> of God, that <hi>keeps them from Evil.</hi> Some Parents won't correct their Children, when they do wickedly; but God will take ſuch Children into his own Hands. Good Children think of this, and are afraid, They think about their Souls, when they are alone; and are afraid ſometimes that they have no Grace; they think their Hearts are ſo wicked, that there can't be
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:041399_0012_101A7EF1711F0320"/>
any Grace there. They are <hi>ſorry</hi> for their <hi>Sins</hi>; ſorry that they have offended God and Chriſt, and grieved the Holy Spirit. They love to think about Jeſus Chriſt. They think of him a Thouſand Times; as they are lying down, and riſing up, and going about from one Place to another. Think about their Parents or Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers or Siſters that are dead and gone; think where they are now. They deſire to know Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt, more than any Thing. His <hi>Love</hi> is better to them than all the World.—Wicked Children don't love ſuch Things. They don't really believe there is a God and Chriſt, a Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and a Hell; nor don't love to think of them: But good Children do. Theſe play ſometimes, a little; and there is no hurt in it; but they are often thinking of Chriſt, while they are at their Play.</p>
            <p>Another Queſtion is, <hi>How does it appear, that</hi> Jeſus Chriſt <hi>loves good Children, and why does he love them?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I Anſwer, Firſt, <hi>It is becauſe his Father gave them to him.</hi> If a Father gives his little Child a Lamb, he will be very choice of that Lamb: So Chriſt loves little Children, the Lambs that his Father gave him.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:041399_0013_101A7EF3088B8BB8"/>Secondly, Chriſt loves good Children <hi>becauſe there are ſo few of them.</hi> Of all the Children that are here, it may be, there are not above <hi>two</hi> or <hi>three</hi> in a Seat, that are <hi>Good:</hi> And won't Chriſt love <hi>them,</hi> think you? It may be, there are not above <hi>twenty</hi> good-Children in all this Town; and ſurely Chriſt loves them. It may be, all the Children in the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily are wicked, but you: And will not Chriſt love you then? Men prize Gold, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe there is but little of it; ſo does Jeſus Chriſt value his Jewels: <hi>Luke</hi> the twelfth, and the fortieth, <hi>Fear not</hi> Little <hi>Flock; it is your Father's good Pleaſure to give you the Kingdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thirdly, Jeſus loves good Children dearly, <hi>becauſe</hi> they coſt him dear. If a Man buys a Creature at a dear Rate, he will ſet much by it. Good Children coſt Jeſus Chriſt more than all this World. He bought them with his <hi>precious Blood.</hi> All the Gold and Silver in the World, would not have purchaſed one of Chriſt's Lambs.</p>
            <p>Fourthly, He loves little Children that are good, <hi>becauſe they are like him</hi>; his <hi>Image</hi> is ſtamped upon them. Parents love their Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, that are like them, and act like them: So does Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:041399_0014_101A7EF69B086CE8"/>Again, He loves them <hi>becauſe they are related to him.</hi> They are his Children. He ſays con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning them, <hi>Here am I, and the Children that God has given me,</hi> Some of you have no Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther on Earth; but if you be good Children, Chriſt is your Father.—You are his <hi>Siſter,</hi> his <hi>Spouſe.</hi> Never any Man loved a Spouſe, ſo as Chriſt loves good Children. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays to the Corinthians, <hi>I have eſpouſed you as a chaſt Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to</hi> Chriſt.—And as I told you before, he is the good <hi>Shepherd,</hi> and you are the <hi>Lambs</hi> of his Flock.</p>
            <p>Sixthly, Good Children <hi>do what pleaſes</hi> Chriſt; and therefore he loves them. They are often thinking with themſelves, Will this or that be pleaſing to Chriſt? and if they think it will, they do it; or elſe, they will not. Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Children don't care whether they pleaſe Chriſt or no; if they can but pleaſe themſelves, and their wicked Companions. But good Children are of another Mind: They go alone, and pray, Morning and Evening, becauſe Chriſt has bid them do ſo; they do it to pleaſe him. As Chriſt <hi>always did thoſe Things that pleaſed his Father</hi> ſo to his Children; and will not he love them then?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:041399_0015_101A7EF8242FBBA0"/>Seventhly, and laſtly, Chriſt loves little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, <hi>becauſe he</hi> will <hi>love them.</hi> He ſays to his Diſciples, <hi>Ye have not choſen me, but I have cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſen you.</hi> They are as bad by Nature, as others; but he loves them freely. <hi>When my Father and my Mother forſake me</hi> (ſays David) <hi>then the Lord will take me up.</hi> And in the ſixteenth of <hi>Eze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiel,</hi> the Lord ſays to his People, <hi>When thou waſt in thy Blood, caſt out to the loathing of thy Perſon, I ſaid unto thee,</hi> Live: <hi>Yea, I ſaid unto thee, when thou waſt in thy Blood,</hi> Live: <hi>And the Time was the Time of Love.</hi> He might have loved others, and have left you to periſh in your Sins.</p>
            <p>Uſe Firſt. If Chriſt loves good Children, <hi>then ſurely he hates wicked Children.</hi> Poor wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Child, doſt think that Jeſus Chriſt loves thee! No, he hates the Wicked. And if you live &amp; die wicked, you'l find at laſt that he hates you as bad as he does the <hi>Devil.</hi> You ſerve the <hi>Devil</hi>; you do as he bids you; you are his Child, and Chriſt is angry with you for doing <hi>his Works.</hi> He may ſend <hi>Indians</hi> to kill you. He threatens to <hi>kill wicked Children with Death.</hi> As the Wolf comes and catches and carries away the Lambs; ſo God may ſend the Indians to carry you away.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:041399_0016_101A7EFBECA7C728"/>
God ſent two <hi>She-Bears</hi> once to tare <hi>forty and two Children in</hi> Pieces, becauſe they <hi>mocked</hi> an old bald-headed Miniſter. Sometimes, it may be <hi>you</hi> mock Folks. You may be carried away by the Indians, and die in the Woods; and <hi>the Ravens of the Valley may pick out your Eyes,</hi> and <hi>the young Eagles may eat them.</hi> So it was with a Child at <hi>Cape-Neddick</hi>: and ſo it may again.</p>
            <p>Uſe Second. If the <hi>worſt</hi> Children that are, will <hi>leave</hi> their <hi>wicked</hi> Ways, and become <hi>good</hi> Children, then Chriſt will <hi>love</hi> them. He will forget &amp; forgive all their Sins. Tho' <hi>they</hi> remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber their Sins, and bemoan themſelves, yet he will forget and forgive. He will ſay, as in <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my</hi> thirty firſt and eighteenth, <hi>I have ſurely heard</hi> Ephraim <hi>bemoaning himſelf thus: Thou haſt chaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed me, &amp; I was chaſtiſed, as a Bullock unaccuſtom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the Yoke; Turn thou me, and I ſhall be turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for thou art the</hi> LORD my GOD. <hi>Surely after that I was turned, I repented; after that I was inſtructed, I ſmote upon my Thigh: I was aſhamed, yea, even confounded, becauſe I did bear the Reproach of my Youth. Is</hi> Ephraim my dear Son? <hi>is he a pleaſant Child? for ſince I ſpake againſt him, I do earneſtly remember him ſtill: therefore my Bowels are troubled for him; I will
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:041399_0017_101A7EFD742ABC80"/>
ſurely have Mercy on him, ſaith the Lord.</hi> So Chriſt will ſpeak of <hi>you,</hi> if you become good Children. He will ſay, <hi>It is my dear Child, I will ſurely have Mercy on him.</hi> This I tell you to encourage you. Tho' you have been very wicked, yet if you return to him, he will receive you into the Arms of his Love.</p>
            <p>Uſe third, of Caution. <hi>It's dangerous delay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to become good Children.</hi> If you put it off one Fortnight, or one Day longer, God may cut you off, or give you up; and hear none of your Cries, when you come to be in Diſtreſs. There was a little Boy at <hi>Hampton,</hi> that was at play with the Children, and he told them, They muſt be good Children, becauſe if they were not good <hi>now</hi> they were <hi>Children,</hi> they might <hi>never</hi> be good; for they might never live to grow up. And within a few Days after <hi>he</hi> died.</p>
            <p>USE fourth for Direction. <hi>You muſt pray to</hi> God <hi>and</hi> Chriſt, <hi>to make you good Children, to teach you to love, &amp; fear, and ſerve him.</hi> And do you think if you do earneſtly ſeek to him, that he will not do it for you! Your Parents will be glad of it: and will not Chriſt rejoyce in it? Aſk Counſel of your Parents and Neighbours, how you ſhall do to be good Children: And
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:041399_0018_101A7EFFAAAFFA80"/>
deſire them to pray for you. You muſt mourn for your Sins, and believe in the Lord Jeſus Chriſt. You muſt believe, that he always ſees you. You muſt believe, that he is able and will<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to ſave you, and you muſt depend upon him for Grace, and Glory, and all that you want. Remember what you have heard, and ſay within your ſelves, Chriſt <hi>always ſees me.</hi> It is the <hi>Devil</hi> that tempts you to forget Chriſt, and to Sin againſt him. Think of <hi>dying</hi> in a ſhort Time. Little <hi>Elizabeth Banks</hi> and <hi>Richard Banks</hi> are dead and gone: you don't know, how ſoon <hi>you</hi> may be called to go after them.—Don't pleaſe your ſelves with childiſh Vanities, with fine Cloaths, and the like. But get the <hi>Wedding Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of</hi> Chriſt's <hi>Righteouſneſs:</hi> and come to his Supper. You may come to the <hi>Lord's Supper,</hi> if you are not above thirteen or fourteen Years old: ſome have done ſo—Think how dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful it will be to go to <hi>Hell.</hi> You can't bear to hold your Hand in the Fire one Minute: and how will you bear to lie in a <hi>Lake of Fire and Brimſtone</hi> for ever?—When you are tempted to <hi>neglect</hi> praying alone, ſay, No, I cannot, I muſt not. It may be, there may be ſome <hi>Child</hi> here, that has a Thouſand Prayers ſet down to
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:041399_0019_101A7F0131F81570"/>
his Account. And if <hi>you</hi> will begin now, your Prayers will be ſet down too.—Own the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant, and ſo give up your ſelves to Chriſt.</p>
            <p>Uſe the fifth, for Encouragement. <hi>Tho' it be a very hard Thing to be good Children, yet</hi> Chriſt <hi>can make it eaſy, and he will do ſo.</hi> Wiſdom's Ways are Ways of <hi>Pleaſantneſs,</hi> &amp; all her Paths are <hi>Peace.</hi> Chriſt has ſaid, <hi>I love thoſe that love me; and they that ſeek me early, ſhall find me.</hi> You'l ſay, I find more Comfort in reading, praying, &amp; think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing about CHRIST, than ever I did in playing and ſinning. The Service of CHRIST is more Pleaſant, even for the preſent, than the Service of the Devil. And it is <hi>eaſier</hi> to turn to God <hi>now,</hi> than it will be when you are grown older. The longer you live in Sin, the harder your Hearts will grow, and the leſs Mind you will have to repent. You muſt come to Chriſt <hi>preſently,</hi> or it may be too late for ever. If your Parents ſee you begin to be concern'd, &amp; to ſeek God, they will pray for you, and encourage you. And <hi>good Children</hi> will be helpful to you. A little Boy not above <hi>four</hi> Years old, was found teaching his Siſter what he knew about God and Chriſt, and heavenly Things. <hi>You</hi> are older than that, and therefore, 'tis <hi>high Time</hi> for you to ſeek the
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:041399_0020_101A7F03823E3800"/>
Lord. If you once begin, all God's People will pray for you. God has promiſed to <hi>pour out his Spirit on his People,</hi> &amp; <hi>his Bleſſing on their Offspring.</hi> God will rain down his Grace upon you. He has ſaid, <hi>All thy Children ſhall be taught of GOD; and great ſhall be the Peace of thy Children.</hi> Chriſt is praying for you now in Heaven.</p>
            <p>But for your <hi>Terror,</hi> let me tell you, that if you don't <hi>ſpeedily turn to the</hi> Lord, it will not be long before you will be burning and roaring in <hi>Hell</hi>: Then you will think of what you now hear, and will think of it for ever. Chriſt is <hi>angry with you every Day.</hi> Can you bear to go to Hell? Your Hearts are harder than Iron if you can think of it without trembling. I am perſwaded ſome of you will be gone for ever in a few Weeks, if you are not converted. Some of you I'm afraid, are grown <hi>dead ripe in Sin</hi> alrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: And when you come to ſtand before, the <hi>Judgment Seat</hi> of CHRIST, I will witneſs againſt you; and your Parents will witneſs againſt you. And what will you do, when you come to be <hi>bound Hand and Foot,</hi> and flung into the Mouth of the burning bottomleſs Pit? You'l cry but, O I can't go down there! but go you muſt, and lie there forever.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:041399_0021_101A7F066893A648"/>USE laſt, Of Comfort to <hi>good Children</hi>; and to wicked Children too, that will now be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin to be good. Some of you have good <hi>Parents</hi> now in <hi>Heaven.</hi> And if you are good, Chriſt <hi>loves</hi> you, and will ſend his bleſſed <hi>Angels</hi> to look after you. Chriſt ſays, that good Children's <hi>Angels always behold the Face of his Father which is in Heaven.</hi> You will have the <hi>Good</hi> of every Thing, Mercies will do you Good, and Afflictions will do you Good.—You ſhall <hi>live with CHRIST,</hi> and lie in his Boſom forever: When Chriſt comes again, and that will be quickly, then he will own you before all the World, and tell of your Love to him, and of all your good Tho'ts, your good Words and Deeds; and when the World is ſet all on a light Fire (as the Bible tells us it ſhall be at CHRIST's coming) He will take you up to be with him, and with the good Angels, and with your good Parents, and with all good People, for ever and ever.</p>
