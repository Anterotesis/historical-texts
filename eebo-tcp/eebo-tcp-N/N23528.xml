            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <head>PREFACE.</head>
                  <p>THE utility of accurate Hiſtories of Epidemics to the improvement of medicine, has never been doubted from the time of the early and valuable pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lications of Hypocrates, to the late and no leſs judi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious obſervations of Dr. Ruſh: but as the Yellow Fever has been ſo accurately and fully deſcribed and treated of by ſeveral phyſicians in the Weſt-Indies, in Philadelphia, &amp;c. it may be thought entirely ſuper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluous to give any account of it as it appeared in this city. Fully ſenſible of the force of this remark, I long declined attempting any thing of the kind; but as ſeveral facts have occurred to me, a general know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of which I conſider as highly intereſting to hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity and of importance to the community at large, and eſpecially to the inhabitants of this city, I am finally induced to ſubmit them to the conſideration of the public, particularly as the Medical Society, which had made ſome progreſs in the buſineſs, have declined the proſecution of it.</p>
                  <p>THE many accounts and complete deſcriptions al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready given of this diſeaſe, ſeem to render it unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to enter into a minute detail of its ſeveral ſymptoms in this place; I have therefore been very ſhort upon that part of the ſubject, referring the more
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:031169_0005_0feb11a1825ff4b8"/>
nice inquirer to the beforementioned authors, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly to Dr. Ruſh's account of it, as it appeared in Philadelphia, in 1793, where he will find its various appearances very particularly and accurately deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neated.</p>
                  <p>As the following obſervations have originated al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt entirely from facts and circumſtances of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, as it appeared in this city; the reader will find himſelf much deceived, if he looks for references to long catalogues of eminent authors, or for an elabo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate account of the diſeaſes of the Weſt-Indies, peſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilences of Europe, or plagues of Aſia: and as my concluſions are drawn chiefly from caſes and occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances, that have come within my own perſonal know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, (which favored by my local ſituation in the center of the Epidemic, and my providential preſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation from its influence, till it was nearly extinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, were conſiderably numerous) he will alſo find that my remarks have not been much either influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced or ſupported by the uncertain communication of my brother practitioners or other citizens; hence, if decided and undoubted facts, ſhall hereafter appear which ſhall diſprove them, my error ſhould be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to my general ſcepticiſm reſpecting current medical reports, and the limited nature that I have impoſed upon my ſources of information.</p>
                  <p>As ſome thoughts which I have advanced, are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidedly oppoſed to the <hi>common ſenſe</hi> of the faculty in
<pb n="ix" facs="unknown:031169_0006_0feb11a47a735160"/>
general, I wiſh it to be conſidered, that they are not the offspring of any favorite theory, or influential hypotheſis; for I had heretofore been taught and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved very differently, till the ſtubborn obtruſion of facts upon my mind, forced me to change my opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.</p>
                  <p>I AM well aware of the loſs of reputation that I may ſuſtain, from attempting, in the courſe of this eſſay, to ſupport opinions which are very unpopular with the inhabitants of this city; however, the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance of the ſubject, has ſwallowed up all perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal conſiderations, and determined me freely to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municate what I conſider as highly eſſential to their welfare; and I ſhall be richly paid, if my temerity ſhall in the leaſt degree, tend to the prevention of a diſeaſe, which in its <hi>partial</hi>

                     <p>FROM the tables of Meteorological obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, inſerted immediately before the conſiderations on the cauſe of the diſeaſe, it appears, that in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning of the ſixth month (June) the weather was pretty warm, but became more moderate on the ſeventh and eighth days, and that its temperature was ſuddenly increaſed on the 9th of the month, raiſing the Mercury 12½ degrees in Fahrenheit's thermome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter in the ſpace of twenty-four hours; it was warm on the tenth, then became cooler for four or five days, after which time it continued very warm and ſultry for ſeveral days; on the 19th the thermometer ſtood at 87°, and varied between that and 69° the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of this month—we had rains on the 2d, 11th, 20th, 24th, 25th, and 30th.

                     <p>The thermometer ſtood near 90° moſt of the time during the firſt ten days of the eighth month (Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt); on one day it was upwards of 93°; in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mainder of the month it varied between the 60th and 88th°—great part of this time it was above 80°, and there were but a few days wherein it was below 72°; the medium temperature of this month was 83°; we had rains on the 3d, 9th, 10th, 11th, 12th, 13th, 20th, 21ſt, 23d, and 31ſt days, and ſeveral of them were very great.</p>

                     <p>Our ſummer fruits in general were no ways extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary; water-melons particularly, from the wet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the ſeaſon, were very flaſhy and inſipid.</p>
                     <p>It was remarked that many laborers employed at the different buildings, gave out at their work, from the exceſſive heat of the weather.</p>
                     <p>An unuſual number of perſons ſuffered in the warm part of the ſeventh and eighth months, from drinking cold water; and ſeveral fell down and died in the ſtreets, whoſe deaths were aſſigned to that cauſe, when it more probably was induced by an apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexy, brought on by the exceſſive heat of the ſun; one caſe came under my particular obſervation which was certainly of that kind, although currently report<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>cholera infantum,</hi> was very common in the early part of the <hi>ſixth month,</hi> and increaſed as the weather became warmer. <hi>Bilious cholics</hi> and <hi>dyſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teries</hi> became very prevalent in the <hi>ſeventh</hi> and <hi>eighth months.</hi> At this time alſo the <hi>cholera morbus</hi> carried off a number of grown perſons.</p>
                     <p>In the beginning of the <hi>ninth month,</hi> the meaſles made their appearance, but they ſuddenly vaniſhed with the above mentioned diſeaſes, as ſoon as the <hi>yellow fever</hi> had ſpread itſelf among us: I did not

obſerve but a ſingle caſe of it during the dominion of this powerful epidemic.</p>
                     <p>The common <hi>remitting bilious fever,</hi> was no ways uncommon in the ſummer months, but this alſo gave way, or rather perhaps, run into the <hi>yellow fever,</hi> as that gained ground in the city.</p>
                     <p>As early as the ſixth of the <hi>ſeventh month,</hi> I was called upon in conjunction with Dr. Treat, then health-officer to our port, to viſit Thomas Foſter, a patient brought into the alms-houſe, whom we found affected with all the full marked and decided ſymptoms of an highly <hi>malignant yellow fever;</hi> the adnata of his eyes and his ſkin were of a bright yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, the latter covered with purple ſpots, his mind deranged, his tongue covered with a dry black ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, with hemorrhages from his gums and noſe, and a diſcharge of black and very offenſive matter from his ſtomach and bowels; he died on the ninth.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Treat was taken on the 22d of the <hi>ſeventh month,</hi> and died on the 30th. Several other un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubted caſes occurred, about this time, in the neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood of Dover-ſtreet, but the firſt one that came under my particular obſervation, was that of James Dalton on the 12th of the <hi>eighth month,</hi> then in the fifth day of his illneſs, of which he died the day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing as yellow as gold. From this time the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe became more and more frequent; yet as we find by the accurate accounts of the Health Committee, not above two a day upon an average died of it, till the 24th of the month.</p>
                     <p>The increaſing prevalence of the epidemic at the upper part of Water-ſtreet and in Cherry-ſtreet, and in all the neighboring low ground between them and Chatham and the lower part of George-ſtreets, in
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:031169_0011_0feb11b2e75a18c0"/>
the forepart of the <hi>ninth month,</hi> became ſo alarming as to drive many of the moſt opulent of their inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants to the country, while the leſs prudent and the more indigent remained expoſed to a diſeaſe, which, from this limited ſpot, in leſs than three months, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried as many as five hundred to their graves.</p>
                     <p>The diſeaſe was not, however, confined <hi>entirely</hi> to this part of the city; for in every other ſituation, favoring the accumulation of filth and ſtagnation of putrefactive materials, there it was no ſtranger: it raged with peculiar violence in the vicinity of a moſt intolerable pent up ſink, to the weſt of Peck-ſlip, which is the receptacle for all the refuſe kitchen arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles, and yard waſh of a number of lots fronting Pearl and Water-ſtreets, that back upon it; it was like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe very prevalent in the neighborhood of the Fly-market, alſo in and about Skinner-ſtreet, as well as in ſome of the unregulated grounds on the north ſide of the town.</p>
                     <p>If an account of the epidemic, as it pervaded the different parts of the town, could be accurately aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certained, and depicted in colors, heightened in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the combined early time of attack, and the numbers affected, blazoned by its comparative ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, there can be no manner of doubt, but that the low ground in the ſoutheaſt of the city as above mentioned, would appear as the grand center of the calamity, diffuſing its effects, like diverging rays, to the adjacent parts; aiding by its moſt powerful influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, different ſecondary centers, already ſmoking hot, to flame out its peſtiferous operations. The ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny ſolitary caſes of the diſeaſe that have occurred in diſtant healthy ſituations, appear to have been kin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled up by imprudent individual expoſures too near theſe ſources of infection.</p>

By report of Dr. S. L. Mitchell, in behalf of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee of the Manumitting Society of this city, it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that not a ſingle ſcholar of the free black ſchool, under their patronage, died with it.</p>
                     <p>Several circumſtances tended to render the diſeaſe particularly fatal to the more indigent part of the community: 1ſt. The higher prices of houſe-rent in the other parts of the city, having concentered a great proportion of them in the epidemic neighborhood, and crouded them in very ſmall confined apart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; a number of houſes contained as many fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milies as it had rooms in it. 2d. Their poverty not permitting them to quit their place of reſidence when the diſeaſe came around them. 3d. The great difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of getting nurſes, and their exorbitant prices pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venting them from getting proper attendance before their ſituation became known to the Committee of Health, often-times a whole family being taken down about the ſame time, their panic ſtruck fair-day friends quitting them in their diſtreſs, from the fear of infection. 4th. The neglect of obtaining early medical aſſiſtance, from a hope that their diſeaſe was not the prevailing one: and 5th. The refuſal of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, after they were taken ill, thus miſerably ſituated, to go to Belle Vue, "leſt (to uſe their own expreſſion) they ſhould catch the Yellow-Fever and die."</p>
                     <p>Foreigners who came from a more temperate cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, as the Engliſh, Iriſh, Scotch, &amp;c. and people from the country, who had not long reſided in town, were particularly obnoxious to this complaint.</p>

                     <head>Symptoms of the diſeaſe, as exhibited in the different parts and functions of the body.</head>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. <hi>The vital functions</hi> ſuffered extremely in the firſt attack of the diſeaſe, it generally coming on with <hi>chillneſs,</hi> an anxious and interrupted <hi>reſpiration,</hi> with a total <hi>abſence of perſpiration;</hi> this however, in ſome inſtances, came on very copiouſly, after the great heat that generally followed the chill, had exiſted for a time, but in moſt caſes the ſkin continued dry and parched, except a ſweat was induced by artificial means.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>pulſe</hi> was as variable as the hues of the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meleon; in moſt caſes it was frequent, and after the chill had ſubſided, it became ſomewhat hard: yet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances occurred of a preternatural ſlowneſs. I met with one caſe in a black man, where it beat only for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty-two ſtrokes in a minute; and in another perſon there was a complete intermiſſion of it in every twelfth or fifteenth pulſation: and in other patients,
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:031169_0014_0feb11bb4e86c000"/>
particularly in the 3d or 4th day of their complaints, were phyſicians to judge from the pulſe alone, they would declare them in a convaleſcent ſtate, at the very time they were in the moſt imminent danger and ſometimes within a few hours of their end. Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I firmly believe with my moſt eminent teach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Dr. Ruſh, that the pulſe is our beſt guide in the knowledge of diſeaſes, yet in no complaint that has ever occurred to my obſervation, have I found this moſt ſure index of the ſtate of the ſyſtem, ſo little to be depended on. <hi>Hemorrhages</hi> from the noſe, gums, ſtomach, uterus, &amp;c. were very common at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement, as well as in the more advanced peri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ods of this diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. In the ANIMAL FUNCTIONS this diſeaſe in its firſt attack, produced <hi>laſſitude,</hi> and an averſion to all kind of bodily exertion with a ſenſe of general <hi>debil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity,</hi> attended with violent pains in the head and back, ſometimes ſhooting down the legs: theſe fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently preceded the chills, and in moſt caſes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied it and continued afterwards, as a very diſtreſſing ſymptom of the diſeaſe. The mind was oftentimes very much <hi>dejected,</hi> with <hi>imperfect viſion and memory,</hi> followed by <hi>delirium, ſubſultus, tendinum,</hi> &amp;c. before death.</p>
                     <p>There was in many caſes an evident, though ſlight, remiſſion in the violence of theſe ſymptoms ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times in the courſe of twenty-four hours from the time of the attack, as alſo at ſome other periods; but in the hurry of the raging epidemic, I was unavoidably prevented from gaining an accurate knowledge of them.</p>
                     <p n="3">3d. No part of the body appeared to ſuffer more than the NATURAL FUNCTIONS, which includes the alimentary canal and ſecretions. The <hi>ſtomach,</hi> as in
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:031169_0015_0feb11be1e348370"/>
all fevers, was affected with a degree of nauſea, and ſometimes vomiting at the firſt acceſſion of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, which frequently ſubſided for a while, but is ſucceeded about the third day, if proper means are not uſed to prevent it, by an almoſt unconquerable irrita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility and retrograde movement of this organ, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up large quantities of green or yellow bile, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jecting immediately every particle of medicine, food or drink, that was taken into it—afterwards diſcharging an aquoeus fluid containing a number of light dun co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lored ſpecks in it; this, if not checked, was followed by a puking of a fluid exactly reſembling coffee, with its grounds floating in it, which by ſtanding, would ſettle to the bottom.</p>
                     <p>The vomiting which occurs about the third day, frequently, is the only diſtreſſing ſymptom that the patient labors under, his pulſe becoming natural, ſkin cool and moiſt, with an entire freedom from pain, and a perfect clearneſs in the mental opera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, that inſuperable circumſtance ſtanding alone, as it were, to humble the pride of phyſic, and to warn, in cool blood, the unhappy ſufferer of his precarious exiſtence.</p>
                     <p>A <hi>hiccoughing</hi> often was very troubleſome in the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent ſtages of this complaint. The <hi>bowels</hi> were very uniformly and obſtinately <hi>coſtive:</hi> there were ſome ca,+ſes it is true, that were attended with frequent evacu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ations, but theſe generally ſeemed rather of a partial dyſentery nature, and not free diſcharges from the whole courſe of the inteſtines.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>ſecretion</hi> of <hi>bile</hi> was greatly increaſed, as ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared by its copious diſcharge from the ſtomach in vomiting, as well as from the bowels when excited by proper purgatives. The flow of ſaliva and excre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the mouth and ſauces were not much im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peded;
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:031169_0016_0feb11bfc6911760"/>
in the beginning the <hi>tongue</hi> appearing moiſt and a little white, after a few days it became more thickly furred and aſſumed a deeper hue, but fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently in the latter ſtages it became quite dry and covered with a black cruſt.</p>
                     <p>The appearances on the <hi>ſuperficies</hi> were various, the <hi>ſkin</hi> oftentimes retained its natural appearance, but frequently, though not uniformly, as the diſeaſe advanced, it aſſumed a yellow tinge. Muſquetoe bites, which before had entirely diſappeared, ſhewed them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves in all the parts that had been expoſed to them, in ſmall purpleiſh red ſpots; theſe were often taken for <hi>petechia,</hi> which ſometimes, but more rarely ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared.</p>
                     <p>Unſeemly ſcabs, oftentimes in the latter ſtages, formed about the mouth, which, on being ſcratched off, frequently were followed by troubleſome little hemorrhages. Theſe eruptions did not in this fever as it does in others, indicate any favorable event of the complaint.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>adnata of the eyes,</hi> in the beginning where the attack was ſevere, generally were tinged and ſuffuſed with a reddiſh color, changing with the ſkin to a yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low, as the diſeaſe advanced: there were many, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, even among thoſe who died, whoſe ſkin nor eyes ſhewed the leaſt appearance of this color.</p>

                     <head>DIAGNOSIS.</head>
                     <p>If it ſhould be eſtabliſhed, that this fever is as highly contagious as is, perhaps, too generally believed, its diagnoſis or peculiar ſymptoms diſtinguiſhing it from others, would become a matter of the greateſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, both to individual ſafety and to the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the community at large.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="11" facs="unknown:031169_0017_0feb11c3b76f8740"/>This part of the ſtudy of medicine has, of late, been conſidered of leſs conſequence than formerly, ſince the fallacy and imprudence of preſcribing for the name of a diſeaſe, has been ſo fully expoſed and juſtly condemned by the generality of phyſicians;— however, in this particular complaint, as the hopes of a cure depend, almoſt entirely, upon the means uſed in the firſt two or three days of its attack, it certainly muſt be of prime neceſſity to know it in its early ſtage. We cannot be too careful in detecting the exiſtence of this diſeaſe, for in its commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, its evident ſymptoms are oftentimes no way in proportion to the danger. Hence, as Dr. Jackſon obſerves, (in his treatiſe on the fevers of Jamaica) <q>perſons unacquainted with the nature of the diſeaſe, would be diſpoſed to believe that the patient ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed ſufferings that were not real.</q> And hence phyſicians are ſometimes led to neglect them till it is too late to ſave their patients.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt ſtage of this fever it is oftentimes with difficulty diſtinguiſhed from the common bilious re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittent, its ſymptoms in general being exactly ſimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar, only aggravated in degree; the pain in the head and back are more ſevere and conſtant, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, whenever they are obſervable, are more obſcure: Thoſe who are well acquainted with the diſeaſe, may often recognize it by a certain undeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribeable appearance in the countenance of the ſick, the eye is often more red, and the face more fluſhed than the heat of the body and the general action of the ſanguiferous ſyſtem, would lead us to expect.</p>
                     <p>The remarkable irritability of the ſtomach, that generally comes on (when the diſeaſe is permitted to run an uninterrupted courſe) about the third or fourth day, whereby a conſtant nauſea and retchings
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:031169_0018_0feb11c687db69e0"/>
to vomit, immediately brings up every thing as ſoon as ſwallowed, ſeems to be a pretty diſtinguiſhing mark of this diſeaſe at this ſtage of it.</p>
                     <p>The yellow ſkin, and coffee ground or black vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, as they ſometimes occur in the more advanced ſtage, may be looked upon as decided and unequivo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal evidences of this complaint; but they cannot be conſidered as <hi>pathognomic ſymptoms,</hi> for although they are to be found in this fever only, yet in the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt proportion of caſes they do not attend it.</p>
                     <p>The prevailing epidemic ſhould always have a great influence in fixing our judgment with reſpect to this, as well as other diſeaſes. Whenever it is found, from decided caſes, that it really exiſts in any particular ſituation, I ſhould conſider every fever, in that neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borhood, attended with aggravated ſymptoms of a common bilious remittent, to be of this kind; for I ſhould ſuppoſe the powerful operation of its cauſe, would certainly predominate over the milder cauſes of more moderate maladies.</p>

                  <div type="part">
                     <head>PROGNOSIS.</head>
                     <p>The prognoſis is to be drawn from the diſpoſition and conſtitution of the perſons affected, as well as from the particular ſymptoms. Thoſe who had been much debilitated by previous diſeaſe, great anxiety of mind, drunkenneſs, &amp;c. moſt generally admitted of but an unfavorable proſpect as to the event of this diſeaſe, as likewiſe did the reſolute and hardy, who would not early ſubmit to their complaints, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavored to ſhake them off as they would a common catarrh. I uſed to warn ſuch ones at my firſt viſits, that I feared from their diſpoſitions, that they would undertake to wreſtle with their diſeaſe, and that if they did they would ſurely fall under it, and unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunately
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:031169_0019_0feb11c82a41f288"/>
their conduct too often verified my fears and juſtified my prognoſtic.</p>
                     <p>In the early ſtages of the complaint, if it came on very moderately, without much affection of the head, if the eyes and countenance were not much affected, and the bowels were eaſily moved by the medicines hereafter to be mentioned, we, in general, were war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranted in pronouncing a favorable termination. But when the face and eyes were ſuffuſed with a reddiſh tinge, or great diſtreſs and anxiety were expreſſed in the countenance, with ſevere pain in the head and back, we had great cauſe to fear the conſequences, particularly if the bowels were obſtinately conſtipat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; this laſt circumſtance, in every inſtance, por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the greateſt danger; indeed, it ſeemed to me that the degree of danger was, very generally, in proportion to the ſtubbornneſs of the conſtriction of theſe viſcera and their inſenſibility to the impreſſion of purgative medicines.</p>
                     <p>In the latter ſtages of the complaint, when the conſtant vomiting came on, there was always great danger to be apprehended; yet ſome have recovered after diſcharging the coffee ground like matter before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, but theſe caſes were confeſſedly very rare.</p>
                     <p>The other ſymptoms of putreſcency, as a black tongue, petichiae, &amp;c. were generally unfavorable, although I did not find hemorrhages ſuch terrible occurences as they are, by the generality of authors, ſtated to be. In the ninth month (September) 24th, in a communication to the Committee of Health, among other things, I obſerved, that <q>in taking a retroſpective view of my different patients with the prevailing complaint, I found among them five who had had hemorrhages, either from the noſe,

<pb n="15" facs="unknown:031169_0021_0feb11cef89532f0"/>
I therefore ſubmit them to public conſideration, conceiving that they merit the moſt ſerious and can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>did attention.</p>
                     <p n="1">1ſt. In ſeveral inſtances, perſons have been taken with this diſeaſe, who had avoided, with the utmoſt care, any communication with the ſick, and ſome that came to my knowledge, who had not been out of their houſes for ſeveral weeks, nor had any affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed perſon been within eighty feet of them, were at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacked and ſeverely handled by it; hence if it was induced by contagion, this complaint muſt be the moſt highly contagious of any other; the contagion of the plague itſelf, as appears by the report of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſicians moſt converſant with it, does not extend at fartheſt above ten paces from the infected body. (Howard on Lacerettos.)</p>
                     <p n="2">2d. Although many of the nurſes and attendants on the ſick, in the part of the city where it raged, took the complaint, yet others, who lived in the ſame neighborhood and cautiouſly avoided ſuch em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployments, did not more generally eſcape it. And notwithſtanding many from New-York died with this diſeaſe in different parts of the country, on Long-Iſland, in Jerſey, Albany, &amp;c. yet I have not heard of a ſingle well authenticated caſe of any nurſe or attendant of the ſick, or any other perſons taking it except they had lately been in the city. It is true, popular reports have oftentimes ſpread the diſeaſe about the country, yet upon cloſe inquiry that I have made in ſeveral inſtances, to aſcertain their validity, I have found them to have originated from diſeaſes of an entire different nature, and ſometimes from deaths that occurred about the ſame time, and which would have happened, had the yellow fever never exiſted: even ſhould it appear that ſome perſons were taken

with a fever in conſequence of the anxious fatigue of nurſing, and the diſtreſs from the loſs of near and dear relatives, which finally proved fatal to them, we are no way juſtified in ſuppoſing that it was this complaint; for had like attention been paid to perſons with a pleuriſy or rheumatiſm, like conſequences might have followed: further, ſhould an inſtance be produced wherein a perſon who had had an inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe with one in the country affected by this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, ſhould afterwards be taken with a like com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, it would not be a concluſive proof of its contagious nature, ſince ſporadic caſes have occurred at many places where there was not the leaſt ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion, or poſſibility of its having been produced by effluvia ariſing from a perſon under a like diſeaſe;<note n="*" place="bottom">

                        </note> the communication with the ſick, might in ſuch an inſtance, be merely an accidental and no ways an eſſential concurrence.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Lining in a letter to Dr. Whytt, (Eſſays and Obſervations Phyſical and Literary, vol. 2d) mentions that, when this diſeaſe raged in Charleſton (South-Carolina) <q>If any from the country received it in town and ſickened in their return home, the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſpread no further, not even to one in the ſame houſe.</q>

                     <p>In the year 1793, during the prevalence of this diſeaſe in Philadelphia, ſeveral perſons who had lately come from that place, ſickened with it and died in this city, yet in no inſtance did they commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate it to others, although, they were carefully and conſtantly attended.</p>

At Bell-vue, the hoſpital appropriated for the reception of the poor, ſick with this complaint, there was not a ſingle attendant who took the complaint excepting ſuch as had been but a few days from town; notwithſtanding they were conſtantly involv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the midſt of the effluvia ariſing from the nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous ſick and dead ſurrounding them.</p>
                     <p>There was not a ſingle inſtance of the complaint being communicated to any of the phyſicians at the hoſpital at Buſh-hill at the time it raged in Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia in 1793, and <q>among the nurſes for the ſick two only died, and they (as is obſerved by the chief phyſician of that inſtitution) probably had the ſeeds of the diſeaſe, previous to their going to the hoſpital</q>; and which appeared the more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, as many of the other nurſes were not at all indiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, although they eat and ſlept in the chambers of the ſick. (<q>Deveze Inquirie's on the epidemic diſeaſe of Philadelphia in 1793.</q>)</p>
                     <p>At our city alms-houſe, two perſons died of this diſeaſe, which they muſt have taken from going into that part of the town where it prevailed, as they both frequented that neighborhood, yet in neither caſe did they communicate the complaint to a ſingle one either of their attendants, or of their numerous com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions that were crouded in the ſame room.</p>
                     <p n="4">4th. There were many patients ſent to Buſh-hill laboring under other complaints, and were put in the ſame apartments with the patients afflicted with this fever, and where they ſaw perſons dying with it on all ſides of them, and were ſurrounded by an atmoſphere, as highly impregnated as it was poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to be, with every infectious diſcharge that could be emitted from the bodies of thoſe under that com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, and breathing the ſame air, ſtill warm, from
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:031169_0024_0feb11d897e99118"/>
the lungs of their dying room mates: and <q>what is very remarkable, there was not ſeen one example of theſe patients having the epidemic, and never notwithſtanding theſe circumſtances ſo favorable to contagion, did their diſeaſe change its character, ſince they were all reſtored.</q> (Deveze's Inquir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ies, &amp;c.) How different was this from what happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the city; there it obliged all diſeaſes to partake of its nature, and to pay obeiſance to the ruling power: (Ruſh's account of the yellow fever) it ſeems as if thoſe patients had been protected for a time, by their diſeaſes, from the influence of the cauſe of the deſtructive epidemic, till they had gained a happy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treat from the contaminated boundaries of the town.</p>
                     <p n="5">5th. Some contagions are communicated by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tact only, as ſyphilis, itch, &amp;c. others may operate at a certain diſtance through the medium of the air, as the ſmall-pox, meaſels, &amp;c. yet all, that we have accurate knowledge of, are the moſt certainly effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive <hi>ceteris paribus</hi> in an inverſe proportion to the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the body from whence they ariſe, and <hi>vice verſa.</hi> From this conſideration, we cannot conceive any thing more certain of producing the diſeaſe in queſtion, than the handling the bodies of thoſe who have died with it, that is, if we ſuppoſe it to be cauſed by effluvia ariſing from perſons already affect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; yet we find diſſections of ſuch ones have been performed, by Dr. Mitchel in Virginia, Dr. Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>krittrick in the Weſt-Indies, Drs. Fleming and Jack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon in Jamaica, Dr. Lining in Charleſton, &amp;c. and they all have lived afterwards to publiſh an account of them: in Philadelphia, Drs. Phyſick and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thrall did the ſame, and Dr. Annan attended the diſſection of others, and although it is very probable, that they, from living in the atmoſphere of that city,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:031169_0025_0feb11da4504ce28"/>
may have had the diſeaſe, yet we do not find that their hardy expoſures have augmented its violence ſo much in them, as to enroll their names in the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſter of deaths. Dr. Baily diſſected a perſon dead with this diſeaſe in this city, and ſuffered no inconve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nience from it: but what would ſeem ſtill more ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary, Dr. Deveze and all his ſurgical aſſiſtants entirely eſcaped the diſeaſe, notwithſtanding he opened a great number of bodies, and conſequently was under the neceſſity of dipping his hands in their black and corrupted blood, and of breathing the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected vapor that exhaled from them. Who could ſuppoſe it poſſible for any one who never had had the ſmall-pox, to have ſuch cloſe connection with per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons in every ſtage of that complaint, and even to handle their bodies after death, and eſcape being af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected with it?</p>
                     <p n="6">6th. Specific and acknowledged contagions, all ſeem to ariſe from themſelves only: hence it would be almoſt as hard for me to believe that the ſyphilis, ſmall-pox, or meaſles, could be produced from any other cauſe, than from their proper virus, obtained from perſons affected with the like diſeaſe, as it would be for me to conceive of the formation of a plant, without having received its ſeed or radical from one of the ſame nature. Contagions ſeem to fix in the ſoil of our bodies, and there ſeed, and from thence ſpread themſelves as naturally and regularly as vegetables do on the earth. But the yellow fever has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced from other cauſes than contagion.<note n="*" place="bottom">Lind's eſſay on diſeaſes incident to Europeans in hot cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, has many facts in proof of this diſeaſe being produced by other cauſes, and without the aid of contagion. Alſo note p. 16.</note> Does it not then admit of a doubt whether it can poſſeſs a power of propagating itſelf? I confeſs I am almoſt
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:031169_0026_0feb11dd4d11bbd0"/>
ready to believe, that it either is always produced by contagion, or never. It is very difficult to conceive, that two ſuch different cauſes, ſhould produce exact<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſimilar effects.</p>
                     <p n="7">7th. It is an acknowledged fact with reſpect to contagions in general, that they are no reſpectors of perſons, but that all of every clime and color, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der like circumſtances, are equally ſuſceptible of their operations. But this is not the caſe with the cauſe of the diſeaſe under our preſent conſideration: I have already obſerved, in the hiſtory of the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, that the French people from the Weſt-Indies, although involved in the midſt of the epidemic, uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally eſcaped it. The ſame remark was made with reſpect to them in Philadelphia in 1793, (Ruſh's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the yellow fever). Dr. Jackſon (Treatiſe on the fevers of Jamaica) obſerves, <q>that this diſeaſe ſeldom diſcovers itſelf among thoſe people who have lived any length of time in a tropical coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try,</q> and that <q>it has never been obſerved, that a negro immediately from the coaſt of Affrica, has been attacked with this diſeaſe; neither have cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oles who have lived conſtantly in their native coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, ever been known to ſuffer from it.</q> Theſe circumſtances certainly ſhould tend to make us heſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate in pronouncing this fever contagious.</p>
                     <p n="8">8th. It is generally obſerved of contagious diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, that they have a determinate period of invaſion after an expoſure to their cauſe: thus, if a thouſand perſons under ſimilar circumſtances, ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed to and receive the infection of the ſmall-pox or the meaſles, at the ſame time, they would gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be taken with the complaint within a few hours one of another; but in this diſeaſe, this would be pinning the matter too cloſe; the ſupporters of its con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagious
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:031169_0027_0feb11e01c240e48"/>
nature, find their doctrine requires that it muſt be permitted to act at any time, between that of the expoſure and the ſixteenth day, otherwiſe it would not embrace caſes enough to give it a curren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy. This ſeems to be allowing themſelves great la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude, as there are but few perſons during the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of an epidemic in their neighborhood, that avoid every kind of connection or near approach to the diſeaſed for as much as ſixteen days together. Might not intermittents, when they occur generally in the vicinity of mill-ponds and marſhes, as well be conſidered contagious, ſince few, I apprehend, could be found among ſuch patients, but that had ſome time or other, and generally within two or three weeks, been near them that had that complaint, or to ſomething that might have imbibed ſome effluvia from them? It may be ſaid, that although there are but <hi>few</hi> caſes, ſtill there are <hi>ſome</hi> who have agues and fevers that never have been within the reach of febrile effluvia from an affected perſon: I anſwer, ſo are there of the preſent complaint; few phyſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cians who have had an extenſive practice in this city, can be ſtrangers to the occurrence of ſingle inſtances of it without any other caſes exiſting, that could be ſuſpected of having communicated it to them.

<pb n="22" facs="unknown:031169_0028_0feb11e2eae67ba0"/>
this city was perfectly extinguiſhed by the froſty nights in the 10th month. It is confined moſtly to low ſituations, in thick ſettled places; otherwiſe our alms-houſe and the ſurrounding country would have ſadly experienced its deleterious effects.</p>
                     <p>Let us examine a few caſes which are ſuppoſed decidedly to have been cauſed by contagion. Dr. Malachi Treat, is ſaid to have taken the fever from a perſon in a veſſel that he was on board of the day before his indiſpoſition; his complaints might as well have been aſſigned to having viſited a patient in the Alms-houſe ſeventeen days before. But I cannot con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive why he ſhould be ſingled out as a fatal victim of the effluvia of this man's body, merely from a mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment's viſit, while all his room-mates and continued attendants, univerſally eſcaped any inconvenience: nor do I know any reaſon why Dr. Treat might not have taken his complaints from the ſame cauſe as this patient did; and he was ſick and died ſeveral days before the arrival of any of the veſſels, ſuppoſed to have brought the ſeeds of the diſorder to this city. Daniel Phoenix, the city treaſurer, is ſuppoſed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt, to have taken his complaints from conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion: the corporation, ſome time paſt, having iſſued into circulation, for the accommodation of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants, a great number of paper penny bills, it has been concluded that he muſt have received contagion, through the medium of ſome bundles of theſe bills, which he opened, that had been brought to him, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having been ſoiled and nearly worn out, to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed, and which he opened and examined to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certain their amount ſome days after he had received them: the probability of thoſe having conveyed con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion, <note n="*" place="bottom">Although it is very poſſible, that he might have taken his complaint from the effluvia, that aroſe from theſe bills, highly loaded with putrefactive materials that they had collected from the hands through which they had circulated, rendered active by their being packed up together in great numbers and confined for a time in a cloſe cheſt before they were opened, ſtill it puts them only upon a par with (and in my opinion corroborates the idea of the diſeaſes being cauſed by) putrefactive effluvia in ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral, and is far from proving them to have conveyed contagious particles from perſons laboring under ſuch a particular diſeaſe.— (See definition of contagion, p. 28.)</note> cannot be very ſtriking, when we reflect,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:031169_0029_0feb11e61b6a14e8"/>
that he was one among the firſt of thoſe that were taken. Whence then could the bills have gathered the infection to give to him? we cannot ſuppoſe them to have come from the Weſt-India iſlands; but even if his indiſpoſition and like circumſtances ſhould have occured at a more advanced period of the epidemic, it would not to me, appear to be a very likely method of communicating contagion; for perſons in that ſtage of the diſeaſe, which is believed to be the moſt infectious, ſeldom have much to do with handling money, or even of wearing ſuch clothes as have pockets in them, that might poſſibly have contained ſome. It may be obſerved, he lived in a part of the town that ſoon after ſuffered much by this com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint.</p>
                     <p>Dr. William M. Johnſon's caſe, is publiſhed in proof of the fever being communicated by conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion; (Daily Advertiſer, Vol. 2, No. 3343) but I cannot conceive whence the author derives his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for aſſerting that his complaints "have actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally happened in conſequence of intercourſe with the ſick." It is true, he had previouſly been in compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny with perſons that had the diſeaſe, but he alſo re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſided in New-York before he was ſtationed at Belle-Vue, he conſequently muſt have been expoſed to the ſame general cauſe of the epidemic, as his ſuffering neighbours were; and from inquiry, I find he had
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:031169_0030_0feb11e9167ae5e8"/>
not left town but a few days previous to his being taken ill.</p>
                     <p>Frederick Steymets, one of the Committee of Health, ſuppoſed his complaint to be the effects of contagion, received by examining ſome papers that had belonged to a patient that died at Belle-Vue hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital. Is it probable, that theſe papers, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps had not been within ten feet of the patient after his diſeaſe had put on ſuch a ſerious aſpect, ſhould imbibe and convey the cauſe of his complaint three or four miles, while the effluvia ariſing directly from his body, had no effect upon thoſe who were conſtantly about him, and performing the moſt me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial and loathſome ſervices for him? This valuable citizen's activity and perſeverance in the noble cauſe of humanity, often led him in the moſt ſickly parts of the city; whence, more probably, his complaints muſt have originated.</p>
                     <p>The <hi>"poſitive facts"</hi> inſiſted on by Dr. Lind, (Diſeaſes incident to Europeans in hot climates, page 195) I conſider as very exceptionable proofs of the contagious nature of this fever, for although an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected perſon came on board one of the ſloops of war which lay in the river Gambia, two or three days be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the ſickneſs began in them, yet it is very likely they would have been ſick at the ſame time had he not come on board, as they had not been but eight or ten days in that river, for the ſame author obſerves that ſymptoms of indiſpoſition in ſome inſtances, do not occur till twelve days after having received a taint from the land air. Robertſon's caſe (p. 195) is by no means concluſive; the little ſpaſmodic ſhock that he ſuſtained, being, no doubt, an accidental occur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; which, had it happened at any other time, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps never would have been noticed; his being taken
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:031169_0031_0feb11ec1fc05778"/>
with a fever ſoon after, proves nothing but that the feeling the pulſe of a perſon dying, did not prevent him from getting a like complaint from the operation of cauſes that had been previouſly applied. Nor is what occured on board the Merlin ſloop (page 196) more ſatisfactory: all the concluſion that I can draw from them, is, that different claſſes of the men, were taken earlier or later with their complaints, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing as they had been more or leſs expoſed to the noxious land air.</p>
                     <p>To theſe remarks may be added the obſervation of the experienced Dr. Hunter, (Diſeaſes of the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my in Jamaica) when ſpeaking of the yellow fever, that "It is a matter of ſome conſolation in the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of ſo grievous a diſeaſe, to be able to ſay with cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty, that it is not contagious."</p>
                     <p>It has been ſaid, and I ſuſpect with too much truth, that were all the phyſicians in this city to aſſert, that our late autumnal epidemic was not contagious, they would not be able to make the people in general be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve them, ſince ſo many think they are well ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with decided proofs of its being ſo. This, however, will not carry a full conviction to the minds of the more conſiderate and reaſonable part of the community, ſince the moſt popular opinions are not always the moſt juſt. I ſuppoſe were all the faculty in America to unite, and declare their diſbelief in the power of the imagination to mark the <hi>foetus in utero,</hi> that they could not perſuade the generality of women, but that, croſſed appetites, unſatisfied cravings, and frightful ſights, will patch their offspring with roaſt pig, plumb cakes, ſtrawberries, &amp;c. or give them hare lips, ſtain them with bloody ſpots or ſomething of the kind; for moſt of them fancy they have facts enough within their own knowledge, fully to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port

the opinion of that moſt influential operation of the mind.</p>
                     <p>Should it be aſked, whence could the general idea of this diſeaſe being contagious, have originated? I anſwer, perhaps from no better foundation than the popular belief in witchcraft aroſe, in a part of Maſſachuſetts about one hundred years ago, as well as in different parts of Europe ſometime before, i. e. from the credulous fears of the people, worked up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on by the erroneous opinions and publications of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluential perſonages<note n="*" place="bottom">Hutchenſon's Eſſay concerning Witchcraft.</note>.

                           <p>On the ſixth of Auguſt, 1795, I received a note from John Broome, Chairman of the Committee of Health, <q>earneſtly ſoliciting me to give them every aid in my power, by my prudent advice, &amp;c. for the accompliſhment of the important end of their inſtitution.</q> In conſequence of which, a few days after, I made him the following communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                           <p>
                              <q>That a malignant fever exiſts among us, is a me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lancholy certainty, well-known to the Committee of Health; that this fever, in itſelf, is of a danger<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous nature, there can be no doubt; but whether it is contagious or not, is a queſtion yet undetermin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I have not known or heard of a ſingle well atteſted proof, of any perſon taking the complaint from another that was affected with it.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q>My <hi>advice</hi> is, that the Committee, while they continue their unremitted and benevolent exertions, in preventing the introduction of infectious diſeaſes from abroad, ſettle not in a falſe ſecurity, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect the cauſes of diſeaſes that may exiſt in the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. It is from the unguarded operations of theſe inwalled enemies, that I conceive we have to appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hend the greateſt danger.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q>If I have been rightly informed, a great propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the perſons, that have at this ſeaſon been affected with fevers of a ſuſpicious nature, has been
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:031169_0039_0feb120472684c00"/>
confined to thoſe whoſe reſidence or occupation has obliged them to paſs a conſiderable part of their time between Peck-ſlip and the New-ſlip. If ſo, it certainly is a matter of conſequence, to know, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther in this part of the city, there is not ſome local cauſe that may induce ſo fatal a malady.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q>That putrifying ſubſtances, after a continuation of very warm weather, will give riſe to ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints; the fatal operation of the dock mud de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſited at Peck-ſlip in 1791, the putrid coffee in Philadelphia in 1793, and the noxious exhalations from the creek in New-Haven in 1794, ſufficiently prove, without the aid of many other equally cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, though more remote facts, that might be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced in its ſupport if neceſſary.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q>On theſe principles I have been led to ſearch into this part of the town, for the cauſe of the preſent complaint, and I believe my inquiries have not been in vain: I ſuſpect that I have diſcovered a fruitful matrix generating the ſeeds of this complaint, and which if not properly cared for, may poſſibly ſpread mortality in its vicinity.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q>A few years ago the Corporation have had Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-ſtreet, between the two beforementioned ſlips, filled up, without obliging the proprietors of the property on the north ſide of the ſtreet and in Cherry-ſtreet, to fill up their yards even to a level with it. Hence, the refuſe water and offal ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, from the families occupying theſe places, are left to ſtagnate and putrify; and what renders it particularly diſtreſſing, is, that the healthful ſhow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, that in general waſh away all ſuch matters from other places, here only tend to render them more active; for by the water not runing off, it diſſolves
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:031169_0040_0feb1206192b8ec8"/>
and prepares them, thus pent up, for entering into their peſtilential fermentation. Our regular and heavy rains, perhaps have been one great remote cauſe of the frequency of theſe diſtreſſing diſeaſes, in this neighborhood at this ſeaſon.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q>It may be worthy of remark, that many of theſe tenements contain ſeveral families; hence an addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional cauſe for putrefactive materials.</q>
                           </p>
                           <p>
                              <q>I make no apology for giving theſe hints to the Committee; the impreſſion of their importance on my mind, rendering it a duty: the hurry of an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly communication, amidſt frequent profeſſional in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teruptions, muſt anſwer for their incorrectneſs.</q>

                     <p>The cauſe of the diſeaſe as above ſuggeſted, not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing removed, its effects, in full ſupport of my appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, truly <q>ſpread great mortality in the vici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</q> as is ſeen by its hiſtory in the foregoing ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations.</p>
                     <p>This early idea of the origin of the epidemic, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly gained confirmation from the manner in which it increaſed: it appeared to be almoſt entirely confined to the level ſouth-eaſtern part of the town, and there it was the moſt general and fatal, in the particular ſituations that moſtly abounded with theſe
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:031169_0041_0feb120928104d48"/>
pools of putrefactive exhalations. Thus it firſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the moſt general in and about the lower end of Dover-ſtreet: this is what might reaſonably be looked for when we conſider that beſides all the lots fronting this ſtreet being ſunk beneath the common level of it, there are alſo on the docks at its lower end ſeveral ſtore-houſes and granaries, built partly over the water on piles, without having the ſpace under them filled up; the foundation of ſome of them, on the ſides fronting the water are partitioned up ſo as to prevent the free circulation of the tide from waſhing away any thing from under them; however, theſe partitions were not ſo tight but that they let in water ſufficient to favor the fermentation of the putrefactive materials that ſuch a common receptacle will always collect, not only from exterior ſources, but alſo from the ſhowers of grain that frequently would pour down through holes that the rats ſometimes would gnaw in the floor. Hence there can be no wonder, that the ſeeds of this diſeaſe ſhould ripen in ſuch a hot bed of putrefaction, aided by the effluvia emited from the great flats of mud in the ſeveral ſurrounding impaired docks, left bare during the receſs of every tide. It is remarkable that ſeveral perſons employed in a large grain ſtore-houſe, thus ſituated over ſuch a ſource of noxious miaſmata, were among the firſt victims of this diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p>The diſeaſe ſoon increaſed; numbers were taken in every part of that quarter of the town, lying be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the upper part of Water, Pearl and Chatham-ſtreets, and acroſs to the lower part of George-ſtreet. From an attention to the ſubject not only during the hurry of the epidemic, but alſo ſince its extinction, I am led to believe according to my beſt judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, that four fifths of all the lots in this af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected part of the city, were ſituated below the level

of the ſtreets they fronted, whence from our regular rains, they very generally became ſtagnant, putrid mud puddles. I can hardly think it poſſible, was it not for the obſtruction of the houſes preventing a free obſervation of theſe grounds, that any candid perſon acquainted with the common cauſes of fevers, could harbor the leaſt doubt after walking through this part of the town, but that the epidemic originated from this ſource, rendered active by the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued exceſſive heat of the ſun during the laſt ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer. It raged with peculiar violence in the parts that were near the docks; this is what might be expected from the additional vapor of the dock mud as above-mentioned. It alſo was very fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal in a part of George-ſtreet, <q>not leſs than ſixty perſons were buried out of it within the ſmall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs of twenty houſes.</q> This was probably owing to the poiſonous ſteams diſcharged from large quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tities of ſtreet dirt and manure, collected during the ſummer and depoſited near the head of it, ſubjoined to the common cauſes above-mentioned. Its fatality to the Weſt of Peck-ſlip was induced, no doubt, by the noxious vapors from the putrid ſink there. The reaſon of its prevalence about the Fly-market, can ſeem no ways ſtrange to any one acquainted with the ſituation of that place, the market being built over an offenſive ſewer, whoſe exhalations were confined only by an imperfect board floor, to which may be added, the effluvia conſtantly ariſing from the putre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying animal and vegetable matter all around, as well as from the ſlip that puts in at it. Skinner-ſtreet is lowly ſituated, unpaved and very imperfectly drain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</p>
                     <p>That putrefactive effluvia will give riſe to, and are the common cauſe of ſuch diſeaſes, is clearly proved by the accurate obſervations of the moſt judicious wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters

on the diſeaſes of hot climates. Lind's valuable book of intereſting facts (Eſſay on the Diſeaſes of hot climates) abounds with proofs of this diſeaſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing cauſed by the air from the low lands in the Weſt Indies; he particularly mentions, that it often raged in the Greenwich Hoſpital at Jamaica; which, as he obſerves, was unfortunately built near a marſh, and that it could not proceed from any ſource of infec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the hoſpital. Dr. Hunter ſays (Diſeaſes of the army in Jamaica) ſhips lying at Port Royal in Jamaica, on moving and taking their ſtation higher up the harbor, have in a few days become ſickly. <q>The men, ſays he, have been ſeized with fevers owing to the low ſwampy lands along ſhore, and at the head of the harbor, from which laſt the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>halations are carried every morning towards the ſhips, when the regular ſea breeze ſets in, as is perceived by the bad ſmell which accompanies it.</q> He ſays that there are examples, where out of ſixty or ſeventy men, employed in filling the water caſks, not one has eſcaped a fever, from the watering place being wet and ſwampy. The ſame author obſerves, that Fort Auguſta, which was at other times a ſalubri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous ſituation, became ſickly in 1783, the ſea that year having riſen higher than uſual, ſo that it <q>overflowed the whole of the ground on which the fort ſtands, near a foot above the ſurface in ſome places, and on ebbing left much ſlime and ouze. A few days after this, many of the men were taken with fevers.</q> Dr. Jackſon (Treatiſe on the Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes of Jamaica) as well as a hoſt of other authors, might be brought if neceſſary, to prove that putrid exhalations are the common cauſes of epidemics. The above facts, together with the many others ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced by Dr. Ruſh (Account of the Yellow Fever &amp;c.) in their ſupport, appear to me to be ſufficient
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:031169_0044_0feb1212eab768d8"/>
to eſtabliſh that opinion with every unprejudiced per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon—which if allowed, no one acquainted with the ſituation of the part of this city where the yellow fever raged as above ſtated, can have the leaſt doubt but that it was owing to like cauſes, without the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of ranſacking Weſt India veſſels or innocent bags of cotton, for that which is within ourſelves, and whoſe very eſſence perhaps, is ſuch as proves it not to be of a tranſportable nature<note n="*" place="bottom">It has been obſerved by Dr. Ruſh, in Vol. I. of his Med. Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervations, as well as by Dr. Lind, that muſquetoes generally attend a ſickly ſeaſon—the ſame was obſerved here during the laſt ſummer: the cauſe is very clear, for circumſtances favoring the riſe of putrid miaſmata, equally favor the generation of theſe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſects.</note>.</p>
                     <p>Many of the ſtrenuous ſupporters of the conta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious nature of this diſeaſe, compelled by the force of the foregoing circumſtances, acknowledge, that the diſeaſe may be cauſed by other means, however they cannot <hi>entirely,</hi> give up this favorite opinion, but perſiſt in aſſerting that contagion often does in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the diſeaſe, when the foregoing ſtate of the air favors its operations; and they defy any one to prove that it does not. To prove a negative is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways difficult, ſuch a one, perhaps impoſſible. But ſince the only proof we can have of the exiſtence of a cauſe, is the neceſſity of it for producing known effects, and ſince we are to admit, (according to Newton's firſt philoſophic precept) no more cauſes than are ſufficient to explain the appearances, and, as has been obſerved, (Pemberton's view of Newton's philoſophy) <q>When one cauſe is ſufficient, if there really ſhould in nature, be two, which is in the laſt degree improbable, we can have no poſſible means of knowing it, and conſequently ought not to take the liberty of imagining, that there are
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:031169_0045_0feb1214cbd2ee88"/>
more than one.</q> Now, therefore, as the above ſuggeſted cauſe of our epidemic ſeems fully ſufficient of itſelf to produce it, nothing can be more unphilo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſophic or imprudent than to ſuppoſe, that contagion ever had any thing to do with it.</p>
                     <p>The moſt probable means of preventing a like ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamity in future will be—1ſt, To have all the lots, particularly in the low parts of the town, filled up, ſo as to afford a ſufficient deſcent to carry off the water into the ſtreets, and not permit any of it to ſtagnate in them. 2d, To have the dirt and filth in the ſtreets and yards more carefully and frequently cleared away. 3d, To have the docks repaired and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in ſuch a manner, as not to permit the mud to gather and be expoſed to the ſun at the ebb of the tide. 4th, To have the ſpaces under the granaries and ſtore-houſes on the docks, properly filled up or walled in. 5th, To prevent great quantities of ſtreet-dirt and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nure from being collected in heaps, and left for any time on the vacant lots, in and about the city. 6th, To have the ſtreets properly paved with a ſufficient de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcent to prevent any water from ſtanding in them; and 7th, To have the common ſewers, in good or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and well covered. An attention to theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, no doubt, will prevent the return of a like epidemic in this city; for, as I ſuggeſted ſome time ſince to the corporation, <q>whether the diſeaſe is contagious, or whether it was imported or not; this one fact ſeems to be pretty firmly eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, that it never has <hi>ſpread,</hi> but by the influence of putrefactive effluvia.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>If, either from a neglect of the foregoing precau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions or from any other cauſes, the yellow fever ſhould again become prevalent in any part of this
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:031169_0046_0feb1217f919e798"/>
city, it certainly would be moſt prudent for ſuch as have it in their power, to remove from it; or if unavoidable circumſtances, or the calls of humanity ſhould render it neceſſary for ſome to continue there for a part of the time, let them if poſſible, ſhun the night air, as the harbinger of death, and eſpecially to avoid ſleeping in that neighborhood, as they value their lives; for perhaps in the relaxed hours of reſt, the epidemic miaſmata may act with redoubled force. Dr. Lind's inſtances clearly ſhews the particular dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger of ſleeping within the limits of the contaminated air; many perſons having been taken with the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaint, after having ſlept a night on ſhore in the low ground, while others, who had paſſed a conſiderable time there during the day, and always returned to the veſſels at night, generally eſcaped it.</p>
                     <p>Beſides, keeping from the night air of the epide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mic neighborhood, and the ſleeping in a healthy part of the town: all perſons who are forced to paſs ſome of their time in the contaminated atmoſphere, ſhould avoid with the moſt ſcrupulous attention, exceſſes of every kind; not only of eating and drinking, but alſo of heat, exerciſe and watching. But I wiſh to be underſtood, not to mean a rigid abſtinence from, or a reſtriction with reſpect to theſe things; but only to adviſe moderation and regularity in the uſe of them, becauſe it is likely that a very low diet and the entire neglect of wine, with them who have been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuſtomed to it, as well as cold, inactivity, too much ſleep, fear, &amp;c. may as effectually prediſpoſe to this complaint, as their oppoſite extremes: I believe the more regularly we ſupport the natural healthy tone of our bodies, the more powerful they will reſiſt the cauſes of diſeaſes applied to them.</p>

He ſays (Eſſays and Obſervations, Phyſical and Literary, vol. 2.) <q>It is a great happineſs that our conſtitutions undergo ſuch alterations in it, as forever afterwards ſecures us from a ſecond at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tack.</q> He certainly had a good opportunity of knowing whether it did or not, as it raged four times in Charleſtown, South-Carolina (the place of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidence) within ſixteen years. In the Weſt-India Iſl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands an attack of this diſeaſe, which ſeems almoſt entirely confined to perſons from more northern cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mates, is called a <hi>ſeaſoning,</hi> and after which, if the patient recovers, he is ſuppoſed to be pretty ſecure. I never have known of any perſon having had it twice decidedly; perhaps ſome inſtances ſuppoſed to have been that fever, were only common remittents. Dr. Ruſh ſays, (Medical Obſervations, Vol. 2.) that <q>during the prevalence of the meazles, he as well as Dr. Quier, obſerved ſeveral perſons (who had had that diſeaſe, and who were cloſely confined to the rooms of perſons ill with it) to be affected with a ſlight cough, ſore throat, and even ſores in the mouth.</q> And what are called nurſe pocks, are no rare things with perſons (who have previouſly had the ſmall pox) that have much to do with pati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ents in that diſeaſe: ſo alſo is it poſſible that ſome people may ſuffer a ſlight indiſpoſition from the cauſe of this diſeaſe, after having had it once, which per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps ought not to be conſidered as a full attack of it. It may be that the great debility, remaining after a complete removal of this diſeaſe, may prediſpoſe to an attack of ſome other, perhaps of a fever of a dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent nature, that might even prove fatal, ſo like con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences might follow a ſevere attack of the ſmall pox and no one would conſider this as a return of the diſeaſe.

                     <p>In the treatment of this, as of all other diſeaſes, the firſt object ſhould be to remove their cauſe; for although in ſome inſtances, the human body by habit may be enabled to reſiſt the effects of injurious im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions, and even by proper means to recover itſelf after morbid effects are inducted, while the cauſe ſtill continues; yet that phyſician would be conſidered very deficient, who would undertake to cure an <hi>oph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thalmia</hi> cauſed by reſiding in a ſmoky apartment, or the <hi>cholera infantum,</hi> originating from the impurity and heat of the city air, without firſt adviſing his pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients to remove from ſuch an obnoxious ſituation, for although he might ſometimes ſucceed in his at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, yet it certainly would be attended with more difficulty and uncertainty; ſo alſo is it in the yellow fever; hence in this diſeaſe it is of the higheſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance to have the patient removed, as ſoon as poſſible, out of the reach of the original cauſe of his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, into a more ſalubrious atmoſphere; a neglect of this perhaps was one main reaſon of the great fatality of this epidemic; therefore, ſhould it again prevail, it would be of the utmoſt conſequence, for thoſe whoſe circumſtances would admit of it, to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure a proper aſylum in caſe of an attack, and the poor ought to be induſtriouſly ſought after and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſtly adviſed, early in their complaints, to remove to ſuch places as the police may prepare for their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception.

died at Belle-vue who went there in the early ſtages of their diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p>Whether the original cauſe be removed or not, the next indications are,</p>
                     <p n="1">1. To obviate the reſtricted ſtate of the bowels, and clear the alimentary canal of the ſuper abundant bile that ſeems to attend the diſeaſe.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. To uſe all means in our power to obtain a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of the fever; and</p>
                     <p n="3">3. During the remiſſion, to reſtore the tone of the ſyſtem ſo as to prevent a return.</p>
                     <p>Whether the <hi>ſeat and throne</hi> of this diſeaſe is in the ſtomach and bowels, according to Dr. Warren, or not, it muſt be acknowledged that it is in a great degree upon a particular attention to them, that the hopes of a cure depend, as it is upon a particular morbid affection of them that the greateſt danger is to be apprehended. To fulfil the firſt indication, a ſufficient doſe, viz. ten or twelve grains of calomel, with as much jalap or rheubarb, ſhould be exhibited immediately and repeated every ſix or eight hours, till it purges freely; its operations ſhould be favored by the plentiful drinking of warm chicken or barley water or gruel, and keeping warm in bed; by theſe means oftentimes a free perſpiration is brought on, and the ſecond indication is accompliſhed at the ſame time; an almoſt complete remiſſion being the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiquence.</p>
                     <p>Let no one fear the largeneſs of the doſe of the purgative, or its early repetition as above recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended, for in no diſeaſe perhaps is it of more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to obtain the ſpeedy operation of medicine
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:031169_0050_0feb12233637c6a8"/>
than in this; it is probable many lives have been loſt from the cautious timidity of Phyſicians, in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing but ſmall and repeated doſes of cathartics, till the diſeaſe ſtole on to that ſtage wherein the great irritability of the ſtomach utterly refuſed to retain any more of it, before they have given a ſufficiency effectually to evacuate the inteſtines.</p>
                     <p>If a remiſſion does not ſucceed to the operation of this medicine, but ſymptoms of great excitement, with violent pain in the head, &amp;c. particularly in perſons of a full habit of body, with a plenitude in the vaſcular ſyſtem, bleeding undoubtedly promiſed and proved of the moſt eſſential ſervice, and ought by no means to be neglected; but I do not wiſh to be underſtood to recommend the indiſcriminate uſe of the lancet by any means, for there are innumera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble circumſtances, both as they relate to the previous ſtate of the patient, as well as to the exiſting ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, that ſhould always govern the judicious phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſician in the uſe of this moſt powerful remedy.</p>
                     <p>After the operation of the purgative, if the degree of excitement or tone in the vaſcular ſyſtem, ſhould not juſtify the looſing of blood, or if as much has been drawn as the ſtate of the patient may render adviſeable, and ſtill there remain a degree of tenſion in the pulſe, a dryneſs on the ſurface, &amp;c. a ſudorific draught of half an ounce of <hi>ſpt. minderer</hi> with twen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty drops of <hi>tinct. thebaic</hi> has often been exhibited with the happieſt effects; a ſweat generally ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with a conſiderable remiſſion of all the ſymptoms; in conjunction with the ſudorific portion, the patient ſhould have his feet and legs fomented with flannels wrung out of warm water, for as long as half an hour at leaſt; he ſhould alſo favor its operation by a plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful dilution with the beforementioned drinks.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="45" facs="unknown:031169_0051_0feb12260338ebb0"/>The uſe of antimonial medicines have been greatly recommended in this ſtate of the diſeaſe, to bring on a remiſſion; but I confeſs, in the few inſtances where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in I made trial of them, they did not anſwer my ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations, the ſtate of the ſtomach generally being ſuch as would not bear even the ſmalleſt doſes of them.</p>
                     <p>For the violent pain in the head attending this firſt ſtage, nothing ſeemed more effectual than the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant application of linen cloths, wetted with cold vinegar and water to the forehead and temples, and changed as ſoon as they became warm.</p>
                     <p>I know not whether Dr. Jackſon's method of uſing the <hi>warm</hi> and <hi>cold bath</hi> alternately, has been practiſed by any phyſicians of this city; but the daſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>cold water</hi> over the body, and afterwards drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing plentifully of a ſtrong infuſion of <hi>rad. ſerpentar.</hi> has been much cried up by ſome; I uſed it in but a ſingle caſe, and although the patient was particularly attended to, yet the looked for ſweat and remiſſion did not ſucceed; this was nevertheleſs, accompliſhed afterwards by the partial application of cold vinegar and water to his forehead.</p>
                     <p>After the bowels were properly evacuated and a remiſſion obtained, I loſt not a moment's time, but immediately applied to the uſe of the <hi>bark,</hi> in doſes apportioned to the ſtate of the ſtomach, half a drachm, if it would retain ſo much, was given every two hours, otherwiſe half that quantity was given and increaſed as the ſtomach would bear it; it was exhi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited in milk and water or ſome of the drinks before<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, which ever was moſt agreeable; a few drops of the acid <hi>elix. vitriol</hi> with each doſe of the bark, ſometimes would make it more agreeable to
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:031169_0052_0feb1228d1a03500"/>
the ſtomach; it ſeems hardly neceſſary to mention that in this caſe it muſt not be given in milk. When the bark in ſubſtance could not be retained, the cold infuſion was ſubſtituted in doſes from half an ounce to an ounce, according to circumſtances, and repeated every two hours or oftener if it ſat well on the ſtomach. At the exacerbations of the fever, the uſe of theſe remedies was often ſuſpended, and the means beforementioned were applied to, till a degree of remiſſion was again obtained, when the uſe of the bark, &amp;c. was again reſumed. When the patient was coſtive, he had a few grains of rheubarb united with each doſe of his bark, till that ſtate was obviated.</p>
                     <p>The acid <hi>elix. vitr.</hi> was uſed with advantage during the remiſſion of this diſeaſe, particularly if hemorrhages attended it. I have already mentioned it, as uſeful in making the bark ſit eaſy on the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach; but in caſe the bark ſhould be retained well without it, it then would perhaps be better to admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter it between the times of taking that medicine; it may be that this acid, while it covers the bitter taſte, may likewiſe tend to leſſen the tonic effects the bark</p>
                     <p>Generally, if the abovementioned means were not uſed, and frequently notwithſtanding our greateſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention, about the third or fourth day, the ſecond ſtage of the diſeaſe would be uſhered in with pain and conſtant ſickneſs at ſtomach, particularly upon ſwallowing any thing; an epiſpaſtic was often ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the ſcrobiculis cordis in this ſituation, and ſometimes with advantage; ſome others received be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit from uſing warm fomentations to the part. Laudanum was rejected; but in ſome inſtances I thought a grain of ſolid opium was adminiſtered

with good effects, and ſmall bleedings ſeemed ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times uſeful; this, however, as well as all other means, often failed, the ſtomach throwing up every thing that was taken into it. In this deſperate ſtate, our laſt refuge was to the bowels, and our only de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence appeared to be upon the plentiful exhibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our remedies <hi>per anum,</hi> half an ounce of pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered bark, with a gill of milk, chicken ſoup or beef tea, and twenty-five or thirty drops of lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num, make a proper injection for this purpoſe; it ſhould be repeated at leaſt twice a day. This means no doubt has preſerved the lives of many; ſhould the bark be retained in the bowels till the period of ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtering the third doſe, it would be adviſeable to bring it away by a common injection of warm water, before that is given.</p>
                     <p>From obſerving that none died who were affected with a ſalivation, I attempted in ſeveral inſtances to induce that affection, by rubbing the gums with calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel and uſing mercurial frictions; but as theſe at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts were made only in the latter ſtages of deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate caſes, I never ſucceeded. May not mercurial frictions be advantageouſly uſed from the commence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the diſeaſe to produce this affection?</p>
                     <p>The diet of the patient in this diſeaſe, ſhould be of the mildeſt nature; panado, chicken ſoup, beef tea, roaſt apples and milk, tapioca, &amp;c. appeared to agree beſt with the delicate ſituation of the ſtomach, and perhaps were the moſt proper food that could be taken.</p>
                     <p>In the convaleſcence, a continuance of the bark and elixir of vitriol, a more nouriſhing diet of roaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed oyſters, beef-ſteakes, porter, &amp;c. together with

                  <head>AN ACCOUNT OF THE FEBRILE DISORDERS WHICH PREVAILED IN SHEFFIELD, IN THE STATE OF MASSACHUSETTS, IN THE YEARS 1793, 1794 AND 1795. EXTRACTED FROM A LETTER OF WILLIAM BUEL, PHYSICIAN AT SHEFFIELD, TO E. H. SMITH, PHYSICIAN, OF NEW-YORK.</head>
                  <p>BEFORE entering directly on the ſubject of the diſorders, which prevailed here in 1793, 1794 and 1795, I ſhall mention ſome circumſtances relative to the face of the country in the Town of Sheffield.</p>
                  <p>The river Houſatonak runs in a ſerpentine courſe through this town, from North to South. Upon the banks of the river, on each ſide, is an extent of intervale, or meadow land, averaging on both ſides at about a mile in breadth. The greateſt part of this intervale is overflowed at the time of the thawing away of the ſnow, in the ſpring; and ſometimes, by large and ſudden freſhets, at other ſeaſons. The na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the ſoil, in general, is ſuch, that, very ſoon after the water is off, the land is dry and fit for tillage. It is, however, much interſperſed with coves and marſhes; in the former of which the water re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains ſtagnant a conſiderable part of the ſummer, and in many of them perpetually; of the latter there are not many upon this river, but there are ſome which remain ſuch through the ſeaſon.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="unknown:031169_0057_0feb1232c461bc10"
                         rendition="simple:additions"/>Beſide the Houſatonak, there are two other conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable ſtreams, running through part of this town, which unite and empty into that river. Upon each of theſe ſtreams are large tracts of low, marſhy lands; great part of which is overflowed by freſhets, and is never perfectly dry.—There is (which is very mate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial) a mill-dam, on each of theſe ſtreams; and the two dams occaſion the overflowing of ſeveral hund<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red acres of the low lands. As ſummer advances, and the ponds fall, conſiderable parts of theſe lands are left uncovered by the water; more or leſs, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the drought of the ſummer. In both of theſe ponds are large quantities of timber and other vegetable matters, which, in hot weather, are al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways in a ſtate of putrefaction. This ſtate exiſts in an increaſed degree as the ſubſtances become more expoſed to the action of the ſun. The foetor occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſioned by this putrifying maſs is ſuch, in hot weather and when the water is low, as to be extremely offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive to the ſmell, at the diſtance of many rods.</p>
                  <p>The inhabitants of this town, who live in the vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinity of theſe marſhy and drowned lands, have, as would naturally be expected, been always ſubject to remittent and intermittent fevers, from its firſt ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tlement. It is, however, generally remarked by the old people, that theſe diſorders have of late years— until the three laſt—decreaſed: owing, probably, to the clearing, or partial draining, of the lands.</p>
                  <p>Although the diſorders which have prevailed in this town, for two or three years paſt, are owing un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly, principally to theſe local cauſes; yet it is not improbable that ſome prediſpoſition to them was occaſioned by a general conſtitution of the air. To aſcertain this point, with any degree of preciſion, we ought to have before us an accurate hiſtory of the
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:031169_0058_0feb123777aff758"/>
weather, for ſeveral years paſt. Even then it would, perhaps, be impoſſible; as it has ever been found a difficult matter to trace any connection between the manifeſt qualities of the air, and the effects of a ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral conſtitution of it, favorable to diſeaſe. As I am unable, either from minutes, or memory, to give any account of the weather, I ſhall leave the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter unattempted.</p>
                  <p>In the year 1793, during the ſeaſon in which ſuch complaints uſually appear, intermittents and their concomitants were more frequent than they had been for many years before. In September and October, there were a few ſcattering inſtances of bilious fevers.</p>
                  <p>Early in the ſpring of 1794, inflammatory com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints, chiefly of the pneumonic kind, were unuſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally prevalent. They were ſoon ſucceeded by inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittents; which were more frequent than they had been the year before. Nothing peculiar attended them; and they continued to occur pretty often through the ſummer.</p>
                  <p>Towards the laſt of July, the bilious, or, as it is called here, the pond-fever, began to make its ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance; principally about the South Pond, one of the mill-ponds beforementioned, and near the Canaan line. There were ſome ſcattered inſtances about the North Pond: and a few, which were at ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance from both, that they were, probably, occaſioned by the ſtagnant water about the great river, the Houſatonak. But the diſorder was chiefly confined to the vicinity of the South Pond. The influence of this pond appeared to extend about one mile and a half from its borders. Within this place there are about 150 inhabitants; and about 80 of this number
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0059_0feb123a6f314898"
                         rendition="simple:additions"/>
were affected with the fever: part of them inhabit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ants of Sheffield, and a part of Canaan. Among thoſe who were ſick, there were five or ſix inſtances of mortality. There were not more than ten or twelve perſons who had the diſorder in other parts of this town. From theſe there was but one death; and that in a caſe complicated with pregnancy, and eventually with phthiſis pulmonalis. People con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to be attacked with this fever through the months of Auguſt, September and a part of October.</p>
                  <p>The diſorder was, probably, in all reſpects, what is termed a bilious remitting fever. It began with an ague fit; intenſe pains in the back, head and limbs, ſoon ſucceeded by thirſt, dryneſs of the ſkin, &amp;c. continuing without much variation 18 or 20 hours: a ſlight moiſture then broke out upon the ſkin—ſeldom a profuſe ſweat; a degree of remiſſion of the fever, and abatement of the pains, then enſued, and continued till about the time of day of the firſt attack, when another exacerbation of fever com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>menced, with ſymptoms ſimilar to the firſt. If the diſeaſe was left to itſelf, the remiſſions would ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times become ſhorter and more imperfect, as the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roxyſms were repeated, until it grew to be nearly or quite a continued fever. A diarrhea, and ſometimes dyſenteric ſymptoms were added to the reſt. Moſt of thoſe who died were attended with a preternaturally lax ſtate of the bowels; which, in ſeveral inſtances, might properly be called dyſenteric. The tongue was, from the firſt, covered with a white fur. After three or four days, a black ſtripe began to appear; extending from the root, towards the extremity; and gradually ſpreading, as the diſorder advanced, till the whole tongue aſſumed a black appearance. Even the teeth and gums were ſometimes covered by this black fur; and in ſome patients who afterwards re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="unknown:031169_0060_0feb123d40a33158"/>In the treatment of this diſorder, evacuation of ſome kind, is undoubtedly neceſſary in the early ſtage of it. Veneſection generally produced a temporary relief from the violence of the pain, and was, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, when the conſtitution was firm and robuſt, and the habit plethoric, frequently uſeful; but it did not appear to me to be important as a curative remedy. Emetics ſometimes did well; and where there was a great degree of nauſea, I thought them uſeful. But purging, with calomel and jalap, was the mode of evacuation I preferred, and generally practiſed; and the remedy which of all others appeared to me moſt advantageous in the early ſtage of the diſeaſe.</p>
                  <p>It is unneceſſary for me to ſay any thing more, in this place, than that aſſiduous purging, in the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning, and a plentiful uſe of the Bark, after the remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions had become ſuch as to make it admiſſible, were the eſſential parts of the management of this diſorder.</p>
                  <p>So ſtrong was the tendency to diſorders of this kind, that people continued in ſome inſtances to be affected with intermittents, or fever and ague, thro' the winter. Theſe were very frequent in the ſpring, but with no peculiarities, and yielding to the common remedy with the uſual facility.</p>
                  <p>During the month of Auguſt 1795, I was in the county of Ontario, in the weſtern part of the ſtate of New-York. There was, at that time, a diſorder prevalent there, of the ſame nature with that which I found rife in Sheffield, on my return, and which I am about to deſcribe. It was chiefly exiſtent in the neighborhood of ſtagnant waters, and in ſituations ſimilar to thoſe places, in this town, to which the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe was moſtly confined. The treatment required was, of courſe, the ſame.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="56" facs="unknown:031169_0061_0feb1241326f0e78"/>On my return to Sheffield, which was the 5th of September, I found a number of the inhabitants, about the North Pond, afflicted with a fever, which began to appear about three weeks before. The people firſt attacked were thoſe who lived neareſt to the pond; whole families of whom were down at once. Numbers continued to be taken, daily, chiefly within the vicinity of this Pond, or within three quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of a mile of its borders, till about the middle of October; after which time there were few inſtances of new attacks. In this time, i. e. from the 10th of Auguſt to the 20th of October, of about 200 (which is not far from the number of perſons living within three quarters of a mile of ſome of the borders of this pond) not leſs than 150 were affected with more or leſs of this diſeaſe; out of which number, but one perſon died, and that an aged man, previouſly debili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tated and diſordered.—The number affected with this fever, in all other parts of this town, did not, I believe, exceed thirty. Of theſe, three died: one, an aged woman: the other two, pregnant women; of whom, one died in the fever, the other ſuffered an abortion, and died ſome months after, dropſical.</p>
                  <p>The diſeaſe, this year, put on a different form to what it did the laſt. It might, with more propriety be called an intermittent, than a remittent fever; though it was very different from a common fever and ague. It began, like other fevers, with an ague fit, attended with pains in the head, back and limbs. The duration of this part of the paroxyſm was uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain. It was ſucceeded by a hot fit, whoſe duration was, in different perſons, from ſix to forty-eight hours. A remiſſion, and, ſometimes, nearly or quite, a perfect intermiſſion, then came on; but whoſe du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration was as irregular and uncertain as was that of the paroxyſm before. After the firſt, the paroxyſms
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0062_0feb1242dbafe7e8"/>
were not generally uſhered in by a regular ague fit; only ſome ſlight chills were felt; and theſe were ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regular, both in degree and continuance. The length of the next ſucceeding paroxyſms and intervals could, by no means, be calculated for, from the preceding: ſo completely irregular was this diſorder. The fever evidently tended to an intermittent form; but it could neither be called quotidian, tertian, quartan, nor by any other name uſed by authors to diſtinguiſh the different ſpecies of intermitting fevers. The pains in the head, limbs and back, were very ſevere, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in the latter, which were ſo univerſally in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſe, that the ſymptom might almoſt be conſidered as charactereſtic of the diſorder. In the primae viae, flatulency was nearly a conſtantly-attendant and very troubleſome ſymptom. Evidences of an increaſed ſecretion and excretion of bile, were generally pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent through the diſeaſe, but were particularly ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in the convaleſcence. Some degree of yel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowneſs of the ſkin, which was almoſt univerſal, indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated a reabſorption of this fluid, and a depoſition of it upon the ſkin. This yellowneſs was in two in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, which I ſaw, very intenſe. A ſlight degree of delirium was very common, during the height of the fever. The appearance of the tongue was much the ſame that it was laſt year.</p>
                  <p>My method of treating the fever of this year, was ſimilar to that which I employed the laſt year.— Purging, in the beginning, and afterwards a plentiful uſe of the Bark, appeared to me to be the moſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful way of managing it. In extreme caſes, parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly, a free and full exhibition of bark, wine and laudanum, ſeemed the only means of ſalvation. It was abſolutely neceſſary that the patient ſhould be thoroughly purged, previous to the uſe of ſtimulants, otherwiſe the bark, wine or laudanum, would have
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:031169_0063_0feb1245f8e27c18"/>
very pernicious effects. I ſaw ſeveral inſtances, at the weſtward, where, by too early a uſe of theſe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicines, the fever was changed into a continued form, attended with a conſtantly dry and yellow ſkin, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>atoſe ſymptoms, &amp;c. One of the inſtances of extreme yellowneſs, which I have mentioned, was of this kind, and at the weſtward. I removed this ſymptom, and recovered the patient, by giving repeated doſes of calomel and jalap, ſome perſpirative medicines, and afterwards the bark, wine, &amp;c. Each purge, in this caſe, leſſened the degree of yellowneſs, very appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently. The other inſtance of intenſe yellowneſs, which I ſaw, was in this town, in the caſe of the pregnant woman, whom I have mentioned to have died in the fever. This woman's fever never had diſtinct intermiſſions. Several ſlight attempts were made to adminiſter the bark; but it would not do. Perhaps my timidity in the uſe of evacuants, on ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of her ſituation, was injurious to her.</p>
                  <p>The Bark did not ſuſpend the paroxyſms, in this diſorder, in as ſhort a time as it does in common in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termittents; but, if the patient was properly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared, and the uſe of it was perſevered in, it never failed to have the effect.</p>
                  <p>Purging was probably uſeful in a twofold way: Firſt, by carrying off the ſuperfluous bile; which was, evidently, ſecreted and excreted in a preternatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral quantity: Secondly, by reducing the ſthenic dia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>theſis, which was, perhaps, always preſent, in the early ſtage of the diſorder.</p>
                  <p>It is true, that thoſe whoſe fever was ſuſpended by the bark, were ſubject to frequent relapſes, and to a long and lingering ſtate of convaleſcence. This drew an odium upon that medicine; and many were
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:031169_0064_0feb1249f39de9b8"/>
induced to believe that it was owing to the uſe of it that people were ſo long in recovering, and, of courſe, that it was improper. I am convinced, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, from very attentive obſervation, that thoſe who did not take the bark, but ſuffered the fever gradually to wear away, as it ſometimes would, were equally ſubject to thoſe inconveniences. Indeed, this ſeems to be the nature of the diſeaſe. The old people in this town, who recollect the times when diſorders of this kind have prevailed here before, and when the bark was not at all uſed, inform me that thoſe who were afflicted with them, were a long time in recover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                  <p>It ſeems that, in all caſes, when patients have got rid of the fever, either by means of the bark, or otherwiſe, there remains an increaſed diſpoſition to the formation and excretion of bile, and that this humor accumulates in the primae viae, till it firſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroys the appetite and occaſions nauſea, and then excites a ſpontaneous diſcharge by ſtool or vomiting, or a relapſe of fever, or both. A continuance in the uſe of ſome laxative medicine, after a recovery, has a tendency to prevent theſe effects; and, if ſtrictly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to, would probably prevent them, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps obviate the diſpoſition to relapſe entirely.</p>
                  <p>In reflecting on phenomena of this kind, the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man mind is anxious to fix on ſomething ſatisfactory as their cauſes. Specific contagion, I am convinced, was in no inſtance, which came under my obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, either here or at the weſtward, the cauſe of the propagation of the diſorder. That marſh effluvia, to whoſe action the inhabitants of ſome parts of this town are ſubject, is the exciting cauſe, and is neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to the production of the diſorders in queſtion, is beyond any manner of doubt. This is evident from
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:031169_0065_0feb124b9ae3e558"/>
their exiſting only where this influence extends. But ſomething more is wanting; otherwiſe we cannot account for their prevailing in ſome years, and not in others. Every circumſtance relative to the ponds<note n="*" place="bottom">I have endeavored to diſcover the cauſe why the ſickneſs in 1794, was confined almoſt entirely to the South, and in 1795, to the North-Pond; but I can find no local circumſtances to have exiſted which ſhould produce ſickneſs about one, and not about the other, in either of theſe years.</note> and marſhes in this town has, apparently, been the ſame, for many years paſt; and yet very little of this form of diſeaſe has appeared, for ten or twelve years back, until the two laſt. We muſt either ſuppoſe a peculiar conſtitution of the atmoſphere, occaſioning a prediſpoſition to theſe diſorders, and coinciding with the local cauſe, or marſh effluvia; or that the marſh effluvia itſelf is, by ſome peculiarity of the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere, wrought up to a higher pitch of virulence, and thus produces a higher degree of diſeaſe. I am in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clined to admit the latter ſuppoſition, as I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that the fevers which have prevailed here, for two or three years paſt, and the common intermittent fever, are the ſame, only differing in degree. I have ſeen all degrees, from the mildeſt form of intermit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, to the moſt extreme of bilious remitting fever. It is impoſſible to ſay where the line of diviſion ſhall be drawn. The diſeaſe this year ſeems to have formed a connecting link between intermittent and bilious fever; and, were I to name it, I would call it a bil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious intermittent. Should the intermittent fever, in its uſual form, prevail next year, the diſorder may be ſaid, in the three years, to have been in regular gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations run through.</p>

                  <p>THE following letters were written at the requeſt, and for the information, of a medical friend, with whom the writer has long been accuſtomed to cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpond, both on profeſſional and general topics. Being compoſed originally without any view to the preſs, and nearly finiſhed before the idea of publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was ſuggeſted, they will need much indulgence for many defects of expreſſion and method, which the writer has not leiſure to correct. Much, too, muſt be pardoned to that pruriency of ſtyle, and po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitiveneſs of deciſion, into which perſons in habits of fraternal intimacy are apt to fall, and which the laws of epiſtolary intercourſe do not forbid. A careful reviſion, would, doubtleſs, have rendered theſe let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters more acceptable, in theſe reſpects, and have chaſtiſed them of thoſe repetitions of ſentiment and expreſſion, which, though partially avoided in tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cribing for the preſs, ſtill occur too frequently. But this was impoſſible. A further, and more ſatisfacto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, apology may be expected, for the opinions which they contain;—conſidering the youth, and ſuppoſed inexperience, of the writer. It is not improbable that haſty and unfounded opinions have crept into the following pages; opinions unſupported by fact, and which informed reaſon would diſclaim. If ſuch there are, no perſon can be more deſirous, than he who has delivered, to diſcover them, or more ready to relinquiſh them. But a concluſion againſt an opinion ſhould reſt on ſome better foundation than the age of him who maintains it. To thoſe who think otherwiſe, the words of the learned Van Swieten may not impertinently be addreſſed.</p>

                     <q>Honor and reſpect are due to phyſicians, emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent from their long and extenſive practice of this ſalutary art; but they, on their ſide, ought not to be ſupercilious, nor deſpiſe the advice of younger profeſſors. If even a gardener may ſometimes ſpeak to the purpoſe, how much more may not this be expected from phyſicians, though young, when regularly educated and diligent in their profeſſion: they have an opportunity of obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the whole courſe of a diſeaſe and its ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive changes, while the others, overwhelmed with buſineſs, view in haſte ſome of thoſe circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances only which happen in the time of the diſeaſe, and are obliged to collect the reſt from ignorant nurſes, who do not always tell the truth. The public good will be moſt promoted, if the fire of the young phyſician be moderated by the ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture diſcretion and experience of the old practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioner; nor let theſe, while they inſtruct, be aſhamed to learn.</q>

                        <hi>LETTER FIRST.</hi> INTRODUCTORY.</head>
                     <p>IN compliance with your wiſhes, and in return for the communication with which you lately favored me, relative to the diſeaſes which prevailed in the neighborhood where you reſide, for the laſt three years, I have put together all the ſcanty information I poſſeſs, reſpecting the fever which was the occaſion of ſo much diſtreſs to this City, in the laſt ſummer and autumn.—I regret my inability to communicate a more minute and ſpecific ſtatement of facts; and the more, as there ſeems little probability, at preſent, that any perſon, qualified for the taſk, will undertake it. Various circumſtances conſpired to narrow the ſphere of my obſervation; and this may have led me into erroneous concluſions, which more extenſive practice and wider obſervation would have corrected in me, and may have corrected in others. But, how faulty ſoever my reaſonings may be thought, I muſt demand abſolute and entire credit for my facts. In theſe, I cannot well have been deceived: for the very circumſtances which rendered them few, made me more attentive, and gave me leiſure to be accu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate. There is but one poſſible way in which any falſity can be chargeable on them; and this might be, were I to pretend to decide that the courſe of the diſeaſe was always ſuch, as when it came beneath my notice. But you will underſtand me ſtrictly. I
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:031169_0070_0feb125a84107b48"/>
deſcribe what I ſaw; and mean only <hi>then</hi> to make a remark general, <hi>when</hi> I ſow expreſs it, and when I find a concurrent opinion on the part of many. In my reaſonings on facts, you will not blame me for taking a range ſomewhat wider; for, ſhould I, in my way, light on ſome truth, intereſting and important, it will well repay you for the fatigue of accompanying me; and, ſhould I not, your friendſhip will excuſe me, in this inſtance, as it has often done before. Of one thing further you ought to be forwarned: That, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning every thing connected with the fever of 1795, where opinion may be exerciſed, there is va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riety of opinion. And as, in this conteſt of jarring and hoſtile opinions, but one can have juſtice on its ſide, I would have you follow mine, with diffidence, into the field of controverſy. Victory does not always incline the balance on the ſide of right; but even ſhould mine deſerve defeat, it will ſuffer in the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany of myriads.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>THOUGH the fever continued to extend itſelf, to the laſt, yet it never became general over the city; and, for a long time, it was moſtly confined to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular diſtrict. As the ſeaſon advanced, the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liarities of this diſtrict may be ſuppoſed to have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come common to a larger portion of the city; and their extenſion to the whole only prevented by the ſetting in of winter. To the diſtrict alluded to, the Eaſt river, from Long-Iſland ferry to Mr. Rutgers's,
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:031169_0071_0feb125daa4fe8c0"/>
forms the eaſtern boundary; the northern reaches from thence to Diviſion-ſtreet; thence weſterly, down Diviſion-ſtreet, Chatham-ſtreet, the extremity of Pearl-ſtreet, into William-ſtreet, to Franckfort-ſtreet, down this laſt to Gold-ſtreet, through that to Beek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man-ſtreet, along which the line proceeds to Pearl-ſtreet, as far as the Market, down which it ſhould be continued to the river.—The ſpace included in theſe bounds, is <hi>all</hi> over which the fever, according to the beſt of my remembrance, exerted any power, till after it had reached its height; when it extended down Water-ſtreet, a little below Wall-ſtreet, and proved very mortal. It is true that there were a few perſons affected in various other parts of the town; but, during the great part of the prevalence of the fever, it was principally active in the north-eaſtern and middle parts of the diſtrict comprehended as above: and, as a thorough knowledge of the peculiarities of this portion of our city is, in my opinion, indiſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to the hiſtory of the diſeaſe which afflicted it, I cannot doubt your patience with the minute deſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion I think it neceſſary to give.</p>
                     <p>The firſt and moſt obvious remark, on the greater part of the diſtrict, juſt pointed out, is, that it is the loweſt, flatteſt, and moſt ſunken part of the whole city. Some places are much more ſunken than others; but the whole ſpace is evidently ſo, compared with the adjacent ground; and appears to have an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination, more or leſs obſervable, in different ſtreets, to the Eaſt river. This inclination is very conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in Dover-ſtreet; a ſtreet which is ſaid always to have ſuffered from fevers of this kind, during the hot ſeaſon. From the diviſion of Pearl and Cherry-ſtreets, down the latter, the deſcent is rapid, to ſome where near James's-ſtreet; about which is the loweſt part of the ſtreet, and from whence it is nearly level
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:031169_0072_0feb1261a1318730"/>
to the northern boundary. Beyond this bound, the ground riſes again; and the made ground, by the river ſide, is alſo ſomewhat elevated: ſo likewiſe, is the whole of the ground over which the weſterly line paſſes through Diviſion, Chatham, &amp;c. ſtreets. Thus you will perceive, that the part of the city where the fever was moſt active, for the longeſt period, forms, as it were, a baſon, having its ſide, neareſt the water, a little inclined. Within this baſon, there are ſeveral ſmaller cavities; one of which, in particular will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire a further deſcription. Thoſe ſtreets, alſo, which are not included in this hollow, but which lie along the river, will require ſome attention; which ſhall be given them.</p>
                     <p>The extreme irregularity in the diſpoſition of the ſtreets, and the narrowneſs of the greater number of them, are great obſtacles to a free ventilation of this city. This misfortune, common to every part of it, falls with peculiar heavineſs on that diſtrict which has juſt been ſpoken of. The comparatively high and neighboring lands of Morriſſania and Long-Iſland, receive almoſt ſolely the benefit of breezes from the north-eaſt and eaſt: The Sound, which divides them from the city, being too narrow to add much force and freſhneſs to a breeze nearly ſpent on their heights. North, the iſland riſes into little hills, from which the wind paſſes on to the high parts of the city; rarely viſiting the low and intervening ſpace; unleſs it may be the topmoſt rooms of the houſes: and, as the houſes are generally low, the effects of a wind from this quarter muſt be inconſiderable.— North-weſterly, there is ſomewhat more of an open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but even this is ſmall. Weſt, ſouth weſt, and ſouth, the other parts of the town, which are higher, and thickly ſettled, break the force of the gales from theſe points. So that, thus ſituated, this quarter of
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:031169_0073_0feb126348f96ca0"/>
the city, though it were perfectly well laid out, would have but little chance for a free ventilation: irregu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly diſpoſed and narrow as the ſtreets are, we muſt be convinced of the impoſſibility of its receiving the neceſſary ſupply of freſh air. You will underſtand me as ſpeaking of a thorough ventilation, and in the ſultry ſeaſon, when it is moſt neceſſary: a partial ſupply of air, equal to the ſupport of a feveriſh exiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence, it undoubtedly obtains.</p>
                     <p>Much of the ground, in the northern part of this diſtrict, is ſwampy, and abounds with little pools and puddles of ſtagnant water. This was eſpecially true laſt ſummer and autumn; there being great rains, and no adequate means for conducting off the water. Indeed, ſo flat are ſome of the <hi>paved</hi> ſtreets, in this quarter, that the rains did not run down the gutters, but continued in little puddles, and were evaporated from the places whereon they fell. In the new ſtreets, which are unpaved, and without any gutters, numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous imperfect ditches aſſiſted the diſpoſition of the water to ſtagnate. Theſe places were often mud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, when the ſouthern part of the town was dry; and the ſteams from them very offenſive, when the dry ſtreets, towards the North river, were perfectly ſweet.</p>
                     <p>Several of the paved ſtreets, and indeed the greater number, in the diſtrict of which I am ſpeaking, are narrow and crooked; ſome with neither ſide walks nor gutters, and by far the largeſt portion of them, miſerably built. Moſt of thoſe which are unpaved, are, in all reſpects, ſtill worſe; the buildings chiefly wooden, and placed on the ground; the old ones falling to decay; the new, but imperfectly finiſhed. Of them all, it may be remarked, that they are much expoſed, ſome of them more than others, to the full
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:031169_0074_0feb12665a6d51e0"/>
influence of the docks, whatever that may be, and it cannot be ſalutary; or to that of a boiling ſun, from early in the morning, till the middle of the afternoon; and ſome of them, to both.</p>
                     <p>So much for the ſtreets, generally: a few particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, concerning ſome of them, are neceſſary to the formation of a perfect idea of this diſtrict.</p>
                     <p>A line, drawn from the corner of Ferry and Pearl-ſtreets, up the latter, to where William ſtreet enters it; then down William to Franckfort, and through that, a part of Gold and Ferry-ſtreets, to Pearl-ſtreet again, will form the ridge of a new cavity (included in the principal boundaries above mentioned) which ſeems contrived, by art, for the dwelling place of fever. This court-yard of the palace of death, is di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided by ſeveral diſmal lanes, courteouſly denomi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated ſtreets; ſuch as Vandewater, Roſe and Jacob-ſtreets, &amp;c. which form the borders to innumerable tan-vats. The whole is one vaſt tan-yard, the firm parts of which ſeem to have been conſtructed by art in the midſt of an extenſive quagmire. To this place, as far as I can diſcover, there is no outlet. Think what muſt be the condition of it, in the months of Auguſt and September!—Yet human beings live here; and habit renders its noxious exhalations, in ſome ſort, harmleſs to them. It is remarkable that few perſons, regularly inhabiting this hollow, died of the fever laſt year. To thoſe, whoſe evil deſtiny led them to ſeek a new dwelling place there, it proved highly peſtilential.</p>
                     <p>Dover-ſtreet is a ſhort, narrow ſtreet, running from the beginning of Cherry-ſtreet, down to the Eaſt river; and contains near twenty buildings.— The deſcent, from Cherry into Water-ſtreet, is very
<pb n="71" facs="unknown:031169_0075_0feb126975a12810"/>
rapid. As the expoſure is nearly to the eaſt, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the whole effect of the ſun, from 6 A. M. to 3 P. M. in the ſummer. The deſcent makes it eaſy to keep the ſurface of the ſtreet clean; though it pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents a free ventilation. But it has been raiſed, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral feet, ſince the buildings, which are moſtly low, were erected; ſo that the road is, in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, up to the middle of the lower ſtory windows; leaving the cellars to the houſes, and cellar kitchens, without a communication with the ſtreet. The yards remaining as before, are, of conſequence, much lower than the ſtreet; without vent; and, of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, all the water, and filth of every kind, which gathers <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>n them, muſt there ſtagnate, ferment and putrify. Add to this, ſome of theſe yards are capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious, and contain little, decayed, wooden huts; ſometimes built directly on the ground; and contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, oftentimes, ſeveral families.</p>
                     <p>Water-ſtreet, above Dover-ſtreet, is chiefly com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed of low, decayed and dirty wooden buildings. This ſtreet being either made-ground entirely, or raiſed like Dover-ſtreet, the ſame is true of the ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the houſes and yards. And, leſt any of the filth, or water, ſhould drain off, from any of the yards, the weſtern ſide of Water-ſtreet has been kindly converted, by the enlightened zeal of the directors of theſe affairs, into a perfect dyke; which anſwers its deſign, moſt completely, by preventing even the ſlighteſt leakage. Beſide, as this ſtreet lies directly on the water, it has the benefit of the whole force of the ſun, the greater part of the day; and of the exhalations from the docks; which are here in great number, and in the higheſt ſtate of their per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection. There is, however, a better opportunity for freſh air, in this, than in ſome other ſtreets. Yet even this is an advantage which the rage for im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0076_0feb126c49c5f018"/>
threatens to transfer to a new ſtreet, ſtill further out in the river; which, if completed, may form another dyke, to the increaſed pleaſantneſs and health of this quarter of the town.</p>
                     <p>Of Rooſevelt, Catharine, James, Oliver, &amp;c. ſtreets, nearly the ſame remarks are true as of Dover and the upper part of Water-ſtreet: for though they are ſomewhat wider, ſtraighter, and have more good and new buildings in them, yet they are raiſed in the ſame manner, have ſunken yards, and under-ground apartments; and Rooſevelt ſtreet has an open ſink, where the drippings of the tea-water pump, after having gently collected all the filth in their way, are received; and being juſt enough to keep up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant dropping, and not enough to waſh the gutter, or the ſewer, the ſtench is moſt intolerable, during the ſultry months.</p>
                     <p>To many other of theſe ſtreets the ſame remarks will apply; and to ſome with aggravated force: but what has been ſaid, will, perhaps, be ſufficient to aid your imagination in the conception of a juſt idea of their condition: I mean of their neceſſary and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable condition.</p>
                     <p>Of the Docks, it may be enough to mention, ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally, that they are badly contrived in every part of the town; and worſt of all, in this part; being broken up into numerous little wharves, thus form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing narrow ſlips, where the ground is left bare at ebb tide; and where vegetable, animal, and excremen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titious matters, being thrown in, at all times, inſtead of being caſt into the ſtream, ferment, putrify, and render the ſtench truly peſtiferous. Indeed, this is ſo much the caſe, with all of them, in the ſummer, that, except to perſons habituated to their exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,
<pb n="73"
                            facs="unknown:031169_0077_0feb12703aa3b418"
                            rendition="simple:additions"/>
they are abſolutely intolerable; exciting, in perſons of a delicate make, immediate vomiting; and in others nauſea, indigeſtion, head-ach, or ſome tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary illneſs, when expoſed to them but a ſhort time.</p>
                     <p>In addition to the above-related facts, concerning the condition of the ſtreets, in that part of the city where care was moſt needed, it may be remarked that, at no time, was there ever ſo great an apparent inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention to preſerving them clean. Beſides the impe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diments which the level nature of the ſtreets, in many parts of the town, preſented to the draining off of the filth which is conſtantly accumulating in large towns like this, artificial impediments were permitted; as if death were not ſufficiently active, and needed the aid of the magiſtrate. In all the ſtreets where buildings were going forward, the workmen were allowed to reſtrain the courſe of the water, in the gutters, by forming little dams, for their convenience in making their morter. The effect of this ſtoppage of water was ſo great, that even in Broadway, one of the ſtreets the beſt calculated of any in the city for free ventilation, in that part of it where the new Tontine Tavern was building, the ſtench was exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly offenſive. And in this condition was it allowed to remain for near two months; though it was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt under the windows of the principal magiſtrate of the city. If this were true of the wideſt, and one of the beſt aired and cleaneſt ſtreets, of New-York, what think you was the ſtate of thoſe narrow, crook<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, flat, unpaved, muddy alleys, mentioned above? No one can form even a faint idea who has not walked through them, in the middle of ſome one of thoſe deadly, ſuffocative days, which we experienced in September laſt.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="74" facs="unknown:031169_0078_0feb1271e2d6f200"/>But this is not all: beſide thoſe maſſes of ſemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putrid vegetable and animal matters—cabbage, tur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nips, the heads and entrails of fiſh, &amp;c. which, at all times of the year, out of compaſſion to men who might be uſefully employed as ſcavengers to the city, are allowed to complete the putrefactive proceſs, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſturbed, in the middle of the ſtreets,—the ſight and the ſmell were ſhocked, at every turn, by dead rat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>, fowls, cats, dogs and pigs. So remarkably was this the caſe, that I queſtion whether there could have been found a ſingle ſtreet, alley, or even bye-lane, of any tolerable length, which did not lend its aid to render this exhibition full and frequent.</p>
                     <p>The preceding ſtatement, melancholy as it may appear, will convey a very inadequate idea of our misfortune, in reſpect to ſituation, without ſpecial information concerning the ſeaſon, as it appeared here, during the reign of the fever; and a knowledge of the people who moſtly inhabited theſe parts of the city, and on whom the ſeverity of the diſorder was inflicted. With this knowledge I ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavor to furniſh you; but the length which this letter has already acquired will excuſe me, to you, for poſtponing the attempt, to a future opportunity.</p>

                     </head>
                     <p>PHYSICIANS, from the earlieſt ages of medical re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord, have remarked that great peculiarities and irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities of ſeaſon, have exerciſed an unfriendly influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence on human health: And Hippocrates, himſelf, takes
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:031169_0079_0feb127512908488"/>
notice of the difficulty, which hence ariſes, of forming a proper judgment, and adopting a ſuitable method of cure, in thoſe diſeaſes which occur under ſuch cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances. The importance of this diviſion of my ſubject, makes me regret that it is in my power to fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh you with no other than general information. You will be the more ready to overlook this defect, when you recollect that I do not pretend to deliver a hiſtory of the fever, and are informed that there is ſome probability that this particular defect will be ſupplied by another hand.</p>
                     <p>Generally, then—every one knows that the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer and autumn of 1795 were exceſſively ſultry and exceſſively wet. Every article of houſehold furni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, or in uſe about a houſe, ſuſceptible of mould, was ſpeedily and deeply covered with it. It ſeemed to penetrate places where we ſhould have deemed its appearance impoſſible. A friend of mine found a pocket-book of Morocco leather quite mouldy; though it was in the drawer of a private deſk, incloſed within a large deſk—both of which were uſually locked—and covered by papers. Boots and ſhoes hung up by a wall, near a fire-place, heated every day, contracted mould within twenty-four hours.</p>
                     <p>Meats ſpoiled in the market-place uncommonly quick; and thoſe which were brought home, appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently freſh and good, in the morning, were often found unfit to be eaten, when cooked and brought upon table.</p>
                     <p>Eſculent vegetables, in general, and eſpecially fruits, were unuſually poor, tough and taſteleſs. The peach, particularly that called the cling-ſtone, was ſcarcely digeſtible; and often occaſioned temporary
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:031169_0080_0feb12790509eea8"/>
illneſſes, quite ſevere, while it doubtleſs aided in the production, or aggravation, of the fever.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>Vegetable growth was uncommonly rapid and abundant, in the ſummer of 1795. I mention this that no miſtake may ariſe from the above remark concerning eſculent vegetables. The more rank they grow, beyond a certain degree, the more taſteleſs they are; and the influence of a wet ſeaſon, in rendering roots and fruits tough, as well as inſipid, is well known.</p>
                           <p>It is worthy of remark, that many fruit-trees, plumb-trees in particular, bloſſomed a ſecond time, laſt year, and produced an imperfect and ſecond crop of fruit.</p>
                        </note>
                     </p>
                     <p>Flies were very numerous and troubleſome, in every part of the city, in the beginning of ſummer; but they ſuddenly diſappeared, about the middle of July, from the more airy parts of the town, collecting in ſwarms, in the leſs healthy parts, and ſucceeded, every where, by clouds of muſketoes, incredibly large and diſtreſſing: and theſe continued to afflict us, long after the time when they commonly depart. Almoſt every perſon ſuffered exceedingly from the bites of theſe inſects; and foreigners eſpecially. In ſome they occaſioned univerſal ſwellings, and erup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, ſomewhat like Pemphigus; and in others nu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merous little ulcers. Theſe laſt, a phyſician of my acquaintance, ſaw even in a native American. The irritation, reſtleſſneſs, and conſequent watchfulneſs and fatigue, occaſioned by theſe animals, no doubt prediſpoſed the well to be affected by the fever; while they extremely harraſſed the ſick, and retarded their recovery.</p>
                     <p>During the whole of this ſeaſon, I remember but one thunder-ſtorm; and this was very gentle. There was but a ſingle <hi>hard</hi> clap of thunder, for more than four months, that I remember; and very little thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and lightning, at any time.</p>

                        <pb n="77" facs="unknown:031169_0081_0feb127aa76e1dc0"/>Our rains, exceſſive in quantity and frequency as they were, ſeemed to have loſt their wonted power of cooling the air. In thoſe ſtreets, moſt unhealthy, and leaſt ventilated, this effect was, in a degree, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable; but, in the airy and healthy parts of the town, on the contrary, they never failed to render the heat more intolerable; and the ſteams from the hot pavement were like thoſe of a vapor bath. The clouds, too, ſeemed to ſhut out every kind of breeze. —One of theſe heavy rains, which continued two or three days, ſeemed to poſſeſs all the qualities of ſteam. It pervaded every receſs of the houſes, and diſſolved the beſt glue—ſo that furniture, in many inſtances, which had been long ſtanding, fell in pieces.</p>
                     <p>Fogs, which Dr. Lind enumerates among the ſigns of an unhealthy climate, and cauſes of diſeaſes—page 134 of his Eſſay on hot climates, &amp;c.—prevailed in the city, and ſpread over all the moſt unhealthy parts, in particular, in a remarkable manner,—in the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings—for a conſiderable part of September and Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober. The oppreſſion, thickneſs, ſtench, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comfortableneſs in every reſpect, of theſe fogs, was very uncommon. In a phyſician, who, in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance of his profeſſional duty, was expoſed to their influence ſeveral hours, one night, they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced bleeding from the gums and fauces, and black and fetid ſtools.—On the city watchmen, however, they had no ſuch effects. About the firſt of Octo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber but one perſon had died out of their number; and he was a man who returned to the city, a little before, and reſumed this occupation, after having been ſome time abſent in the country.—Whether this ſecurity of the watchmen is to be attributed—as it is by Dr. Ruſh, to the influence of the cool night-air

                     </head>
                     <p>IT is a fact, generally admitted, I believe, that, of thoſe who were ſick and who died of the Fever of 1795, the greater number were foreigners: perſons, either juſt arrived from other States, from the Weſt-Indies, and from Europe; or who had not been many months, or years, ſettled in this city. It is probable that the proportion of citizens, who died, to ſtrangers, did not exceed one to ſeven. Of theſe ſtrangers, it is thought, a large number were Iriſh; and there are ſome reaſons why this ſhould be true; but I cannot pretend to know it to be ſo, from my own obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. The cauſes productive of diſeaſe in foreign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, in thoſe of this nation in particular, are numer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, and ſome of them deſerve particu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>r attention. This I deſign to beſtow upon them, after remarking, that, both among natives and foreigners, the ſeverity of the diſeaſe was experienced by the poor.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Dr. Blane, in his obſervations on the diſeaſes of ſeamen, remarks, <q>that it ſometimes happens, that a ſhip, with a long eſtabliſhed crew, ſhall be very <hi>healthy;</hi> yet, if ſtrangers are introduced among them, who are alſo <hi>healthy,</hi> ſickneſs will be mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tually produced;</q> and Dr. Ruſh, in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> firſt vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lume of his "Medical Obſervations and Inquiries" takes notice of this remark of Dr. Blane's, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firms it, by a reference to the experience of our coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, during the late war. Theſe are his words— <q>The hiſtory of diſeaſes furniſhes many proofs of the truth of this aſſertion.—It was very remarkable, that, while the American army at Cambridge, in
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0084_0feb128442a185e0"/>
the year 1775, conſiſted only of New-England men (whoſe habits and manners were the ſame) there was ſcarcely any ſickneſs among them. It was not till the troops of the eaſtern, middle and ſouthern ſtates, met at New-York and Ticonderoga, in the year 1776, that the Typhus became univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal, and ſpread with ſuch peculiar mortality in the armies of the United States.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is unneceſſary to enlarge, in this place, on the oppreſſions and diſtreſſes of what are called the lower order of the people in Europe. War, which doubles the burthens upon every rank in ſociety, exerciſes an aggravated violence upon the poor. This violence, ſeverely felt by all, in England, chiefly falls upon the manufacturing poor; who are, at the ſame time, the moſt ignorant, abject and depraved: in Ireland, its effects are more general, including in its circle of wretchedneſs, the cultivator, as well as the mechanic. The preſent war in Europe, unparalelled as it is for the number of men involved in it, has given birth to oppreſſions and calamities equally new and deſtruct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ive. Under theſe circumſtances, and when men of fortune and reſpectability, diſguſted and diſheartened at the enormous maſs of miſery which every day and every hour preſented to their view, turned their thoughts towards another hemiſphere, it is not to be wondered at, that the wretched and depreſſed poor ſhould pant for a ſettlement in a country, where li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty is t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                           <desc>••</desc>
                        </gap> portion of every man, and independence the ſure crown of all his honeſt labors; and which had been, <hi>fallaciouſly,</hi> repreſented as courting their ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptance, and loading their untoiling hands with every gift of fortune.—The real bleſſings of our go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and country are precious and ineſtimable; but they are of a nature not to be felt and enjoyed by minds depraved by ignorance and debaſed by ſlavery.
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:031169_0085_0feb1285e59f12b0"/>
That temperate enjoyment of the goods of life, and moderate exerciſe of the bleſſings of independence, which, alone, enlightened liberty ſanctions, can neither be conceived of, nor reliſhed, by thoſe who have been accuſtomed to crouch beneath the iron rod of deſpotiſm. Liberty, according to their ideas, was the reverſe of all they felt; and independence, the unlimited gratifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of all their appetites. The miſrepreſentations, too, of ſpeculating and unprincipled men, who were inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſted in the ſale of large tracts of unſettled territory, had foſtered and extended theſe erroneous concep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Hence, when the poor and miſerable emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants, on their arrival here, found that neither gold, nor farms, ſolicited their acceptance; that, in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, as well as in Europe, their life was alike deſtined to be a life of toil; when they perceived that licen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiouſneſs, the only liberty of which they had any no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, brought puniſhment along with it; the diſappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, new and unexpected, became a powerful ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravation to every other cauſe of diſeaſe. You will not underſtand me as extending theſe laſt remarks to all emigrants to this country, nor ſuppoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived hope was preſent, or active, in every caſe. On ſome, even of the better ſort, it undoubtedly had a very pernicious influence; on the poor and friendleſs, effects ſtill more melancholy.—But to return:—Two motives, then, poverty and oppreſſion at home, and the hope of independence and wealth abroad, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curred to draw to the United States, an aſtoniſhing number of the inhabitants of Europe; and as theſe motives were moſtly active among the very poor and very wretched, people of this deſcription emigrated in the greateſt number. Of theſe, the largeſt portions fell to the ſhare of the States of Pennſylvania and New-York; and the moſt worthleſs and profligate, proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly, reſted in the capitals of thoſe States.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="82" facs="unknown:031169_0086_0feb129804dd8778"/>The diſtreſſes in the Weſt-Indies, eſpecially thoſe occaſioned by the deſtruction of Cape Francaiſe, obliged numbers of the iſlanders, white, mulatto and black, to take refuge here. This circumſtance, harmleſs, in great meaſure, to the people them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, can ſcarcely be conſidered as ſo, in relation to the whole. Whatever effect it may have had, all things conſidered, it ſeems irrational to ſuppoſe it to have been good.</p>
                     <p>This collection of ſtrangers, from various parts of Europe and America, which had been rapidly form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for two or three years, was greatly increaſed by repeated arrivals of large importations from Great-Britain and Ireland, during the fall of 1794, and the ſpring and ſummer of 1795. One or two ſhips came into this port, after the commencement of the fever, filled with emigrants.</p>
                     <p>If, then, the opinion of Dr. Blane, corroborated by the teſtimony of Dr. Ruſh, be founded in truth; that the ſudden intermingling of people of various and diſcordant habits, climates and nations, be a circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance favoring the production of diſeaſe; this cauſe of fever was certainly preſent, in New-York, in the year 1795.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. <q>Men who exchange their native, for a diſtant climate, may be conſidered</q>—ſays Dr. Lind, page 2d, of his Eſſay on the diſeaſes incidental to Euro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peans in hot climates—<q>as affected in a manner ſomewhat analogous to plants removed into a foreign ſoil; where the utmoſt care and attention are required to keep them in health, and to inure them to their new ſituation; ſince, thus tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted, ſome change muſt happen in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions of both.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="83" facs="unknown:031169_0087_0feb1288ee68c0a8"/>"Some climates"—he continues—<q>are healthy and favorable to European conſtitutions, as ſome ſoils are favorable to the production of European plants. But moſt of the countries beyond the limits of Europe, which are frequented by Europeans, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortunately, prove very unhealthy to them.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>The healthineſs and unhealthineſs of a climate, or the effect wrought on the human conſtitution by a change of climate, muſt be more or leſs conſiderable, according to the extent of its connection with other circumſtances. How far ſuch a connection was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervable in this city, in reſpect to the Fever of 1795, will appear by and bye.</p>
                     <p>Two remarks may be made, concerning the emi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grants from the Weſt-Indies. The firſt is, that they generally bear the firſt winter, after their arrival in the middle and northern ſtates, better than the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, while they are leſs incommoded by the ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer heats. The ſecond is, that they ſuffer leſs from Fevers, during the ſultry ſeaſon, than Emigrants from Europe. It ſeems difficult to explain the firſt men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned fact; the ſecond I ſhall attempt to account for, hereafter.</p>
                     <p>The climate of this part of America differs from that of Great-Britain and Ireland in the intenſer cold of its winters; more extreme and longer continued heat of its ſummers; and the greater variableneſs of its temperature.</p>
                     <p>The great body of emigrants come over to Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica in large companies, crouded together in one ſhip, and ill-accommodated in every reſpect. After a long voyage, under ſuch circumſtances, they muſt be ſenſible, in an uncommon degree, to the influence of a new climate, and to every ſudden variation of
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:031169_0088_0feae5209bfbcd98"/>
temperature. If they arrive, as is often the caſe, in the ſultry ſeaſon, the effects of a change of climate muſt be felt in all their force. The heats of the ſummer muſt render them leſs able to cope with the ruggedneſs of the following winter; as the ſeverity of the winter makes them more unfit to endure the ſcorching ſun of the ſucceeding ſummer. This will account for the ſuffering of many who had paſſed a ſeaſon in the country before.</p>
                     <p>To this it may be added, that, in 1795, the cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate muſt have been particularly bad; ſince it may be ſuppoſed to have preternaturally affected the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of the country. This being admitted, it is not difficult to conceive of its having had a pernicious influence on ſtrangers; and being, therefore, fairly enumerable among the cauſes prediſpoſing to the fever of this ſeaſon.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. An animal diet, or a great uſe of animal food, eſpecially in ſummer, and when there is general diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition to fevers, is thought by many phyſicians, of our own and other countries, to favor their produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and a vegetable diet, on the contrary, to be a preventative, or preſervative, againſt them. This, alſo, was the opinion of the humane and celebrated Howard, who is known to have abſtained from the uſe of fleſh, for many years previous to his death.— Both theory and fact ſeem to concur in eſtabliſhing the truth of this doctrine; for a ſatisfactory illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of which I may ſafely refer you to the publica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Drs. Ruſh and Mitchill.</p>
                     <p>The proportion of animal, to vegetable food, eaten at the beſt provided tables in America, is ſo great as to aſtoniſh a European. This may be ſaid of the country generally—but is eſpecially true
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:031169_0089_0feb12901aae0078"/>
of the cities of New-York and Philadelphia. An objection, too, has been made by Europeans, particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly by the French, to our mode of cooking meats. They complain, and with apparent juſtice, of the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect action which fire is allowed to exert upon them; and repreſent us as little better than the Aby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinians, who devour a part of the ox, while he is yet expiring.—It is certain that a great change is obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able in the appearance and kind of diſeaſes, in the United States, ſince our citizens have ſubſtituted freſh meats, for ſalted, in ſummer.—Some reaſons may be aſſigned for this effect, which would countenance the opinion of the French; but they will ſuggeſt themſelves to your own mind, and would require more room than I can allow them, in this place.— But, ſurely, if meats be prejudicial to health, in our hot ſeaſons; if they expoſe us, by their uſe, to diſeaſes of the kind, which prevailed here, laſt year; how pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culiarly muſt this evil have been felt by us, when they were in a condition ſo uncommonly bad as the year 1795—If the wealthy often had meats brought upon their tables, in a ſtate of incipient putreſcency, what muſt have been the ſtate of thoſe which were conſumed by the poor?—Add to this, that the vege<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tables principally uſed among us, are not diſtinguiſhed for their aſceſcency.—Theſe remarks apply to all ranks of our inhabitants; and plainly ſhew that the ſituation of our city, the laſt year, was unuſually bad, in this reſpect, for natives, as well as foreigners. Other circumſtances aſſiſted to heighten the evil, in relation to theſe laſt.</p>
                     <p>The poor of Europe, and eſpecially of Ireland, are but ſparingly accuſtomed to the uſe of meat. In that iſland, it is not uncommon for people to paſs through life, without ever having taſted it, except by ſtealth, accident, or on holydays.—In this country, the great
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:031169_0090_0feb1291c3330bc8"/>
uſe of meat produces a comparative ſcantineſs in the ſupply of vegetables; and a proportionate poorneſs and dearneſs of them. This is ſufficient to determine the choice of the poor towards the uſe of meat; and produce, in the emigrant poor, an almoſt total and ſudden change, in their aliment. When, too, we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect that animal food is more gratifying to a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>praved taſte; that it provokes to greater repletion, than vegetable food; that it is more neceſſary to hard laborers; and that it is moſt craved by thoſe who in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dulge in the habitual uſe of ardent ſpirits; we are alive, at once, to the full perception of the miſchiev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous effects ariſing from ſuch a ſubſtitute, to their for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer bland and ſcanty meals. In thoſe, with whom this change of diet took place the laſt year, for the firſt, the conſequences muſt have been ſtill more per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious. For we ought to conſider that if the poor always conſume the worſt proviſions, thoſe who were ſtrangers, as well as poor, were leaſt likely to procure thoſe which were good; and the ſlighteſt obſervation is ſufficient to convince us, that their bad qualities could not have been much obviated by the prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion common among the conſumers.</p>
                     <p>May we not, then, conclude—that the aliment uſed by the citizens, generally, was favorable to the production of diſeaſe—and that the great and ſudden change of diet, among the emigrants, conſidering the nature of their food in 1795, muſt have diſpoſed them, in a particular manner, to be affected by the fever of the country?</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. If unwholeſome aliment aſſiſted in the produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, or aggravation, of the fever of 1795, improper drinks were ſcarcely leſs active, to the ſame end.— The uſe of ardent ſpirits, among all claſſes of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and eſpecially among the laboring claſſes, is aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toniſhingly
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:031169_0091_0feb1294d08b9c68"/>
great and general, throughout the United States. No country in the world, in all probability, conſumes an equal quantity, in proportion to its po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulation. In vain has the eloquence of the moſt en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightened phyſicians and moraliſts been exerted againſt them, for centuries: governments conſtitute it the intereſt of individuals to prepare and circulate them; they withhold from men that knowledge which would teach them to ſhun, or elevate them above the uſe of, intoxicating liquors; and prejudices are excited and foſtered in their favor, that the igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant and depraved, to whom they form a congenial gratification, may continue to conſume them; to the deſtruction of morals, the emolument of diſtillers, and the augmentation of the revenue. As they are more eaſily and cheaply obtained in America, than in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope; as the wages of laborers are more conſiderable here, than there, and therefore permit them greater indulgences; as there is every encouragement from example; and as a fiercer ſun, according to common notions, juſtifies a more prodigal uſe of them; it is naturally ſuppoſeable that the emigrants of the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boring claſs indulged in them, to an unuſual degree. Unqueſtionably, the uſe of intoxicating liquors was highly pernicious to thoſe moſt accuſtomed to them; to thoſe not ſo habituated, it was, as unqueſtionably, ſtill more pernicious. In Philadelphia in 1793, when the fever was prevalent, Dr. Ruſh remarks that—<q>a plentiful meal, and a <hi>few extra glaſſes of wine,</hi> ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom failed of exciting the fever.</q> With us the diſeaſe was leſs ferocious and leſs active; but, as if no means of cauſing it to become more ſo were to be neglected, an idea was, moſt unhappily circulated —and, it ſhould ſeem, was countenanced by perſons bearing the title of phyſicians,—that free living, the plentiful uſe of vinous and ardent liquors, was a pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erful
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:031169_0092_0feae523aebfdd70"/>
preventative of the fever. The dreadful con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences which a belief of this ſort produced, were numerous, and ſhocking to the laſt degree. The fear of death, ſo active in ignorant minds, when once arouſed; idleneſs, the parent of every vice, and liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs, the conſequence of want of employment<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all conſpired, with this pernicious doctrine, to effect the ruin of numbers. Never, I believe, was drunkeneſs ſo common. Not a day paſſed that I did not meet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons reeling through the ſtreets, or ſtretched on the pavement—ſometimes in the noon-day ſun, unſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered, and ſometimes expoſed to the heavieſt rains. I have ſeen three men, lying in this condition, in one little ſtreet. Theſe were all, as you may ſuppoſe, among the moſt depraved of our poor; and moſt of them were foreigners.</p>
                     <p>Is it poſſible that conduct ſuch as this ſhould fail of giving new activity to every other cauſe of diſeaſe?</p>
                     <p n="5">V. I have, in a former letter, given you ſome ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the condition of that part of the town, where the Fever moſt prevailed; it is now to be no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticed that it is in that diſtrict that the greateſt num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of the poor, eſpecially the emigrant poor, reſide. In thoſe numerous miſerable dwellings, were theſe wretched people crowded together; many families in one houſe; and not infrequently many families of different nations. In ſome inſtances, a ſingle room in one of thoſe half-under-ground huts, ſerved as bed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>room, kitchen and ſhop, to a whole family; while underneath them, a cellar, half filled with mud and water, ſent up its peſtilential ſteams; and under their window, a yard in the ſame condition, was rendered ſtill more noxious, by receiving the offals caſt out from every part of the houſe.</p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <pb n="89" facs="unknown:031169_0093_0feb1331d3a0b820"/>VI. But, if the ſordid and almoſt unavoidable fil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thineſs of their dwellings were promotive of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe, under which the wretched inhabitants lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed or ſuffered, ſtill more ſo, in ſome inſtances, muſt have been their inattention to perſonal cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                     <p>It was well remarked, <hi>formerly,</hi> by a foreigner, of the Engliſh ladies, and is applicable, with but little de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duction to our own fair country-women,—That they were <hi>whited ſepulchres</hi>; beauteous and clean, without; but within—You know the reſt.—</p>
                     <p>Were our country-women diſciples of Zoroaſter, they could not more ſtudiouſly hold ſacred the ele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of water.—How many of thoſe houſe-wives, how many of thoſe maidens, the cleanlineſs of whoſe houſes, and the neatneſs of whoſe apparel, we often have occaſion to admire and commend, think you, have applied to any other parts of their perſons, than their hands and faces, this purifying element?<note n="*" place="bottom">

                     <p>I ſhall conclude this letter with a few remarks, which the ſubject naturally inſpires.</p>
                     <p>The preceding ſtatement is ſtrictly applicable, in all its extent, to great numbers of thoſe who were ſick of the Fever of 1795. Your own mind will ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt to you that there muſt have been many excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and, likewiſe, among whom thoſe exceptions were to be found.</p>
                     <p>You will learn, from it, that circumſtances un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly to foreigners were more numerous and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cible, in more inſtances, than to natives; and will perceive, at the ſame time, what is appropriate to each, and what common to all.</p>
                     <p>It will, further, be evident, that, though ſome of theſe cauſes may have been ſufficient, ſingly, to create a prediſpoſition to diſeaſe,—and probably did, in ſome inſtances, create it; yet, that prediſpoſition muſt have been more conſiderable, and the diſeaſe which followed more ſevere, in proportion to the combination of two, or more, of them.</p>
                     <p>It now remains to take a comprehenſive view of the reſults furniſhed to us by this letter, in connection with the two immediately preceding it; but this I ſhall defer to another opportunity.</p>

<pb n="93" facs="unknown:031169_0097_0feb129ad0819600"/>
on the ſo-much-agitated queſtion of <hi>domeſtic,</hi> or <hi>fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign,</hi> origin?—Were a rational being to ſee hundreds of men, women and children, removed from a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perate and equable climate, to a climate ſubject to the extremes of heat and cold, and to ſudden and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſive alternations of temperature; were he to obſerve this removal to take place in crowded, ill-provided, ſhips, which were a long time at ſea, and whoſe ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rival was at ſuch a time as to ſubject them to the ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gors of a winter, ſevere beyond their knowledge, and under all the inconveniences attendant on poverty, ignorance, and vice in a ſtrange land—or to the terrors of a ſummer equally intolerable to them, from its inexperienced ſultrineſs; were he to view them, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter ſuſtaining, one, or more, ſuch ſeaſons, or immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, expoſed to the influence of a ſeaſon ſultry and moiſt beyond the common courſe, in this new climate; ſhould he learn that they exchanged oppreſſion for li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centiouſneſs, and, in ſome caſes, found all their hopes illuſory; that they ſubſtituted a ſcanty ſupply of wretched vegetables and a gluttonous uſe of ſemi-putrid, ill-cooked, meats, for a ſparing conſumption of mild and healthy vegetable food; that they were often perſecuted by ſwarms of inſects, whoſe bites raiſed ſwellings or cauſed ulcers, when, till now, they had been unaccuſtomed to any; ſhould he ſee them indulging, habitually, in the uſe of intoxicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing liquors, to which many of them had hitherto been ſtrangers; were he to find them dwelling in narrow, unpaved, ſunken, and illy-ventilated ſtreets, in which large collections of putrid matter were allowed to remain, where there were puddles of ſtagnant water, or open ſewers, and in the neighborhoods of pools or docks, whoſe noxious qualities were heigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened by the admixture of putrefying vegetable and animal ſubſtances;—were he to diſcover the houſes in which they dwelt, to be decayed or ſlight, and
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:031169_0098_0feb129d9b389508"/>
ſometimes pervious to ſun and rain,—in part, below the ſurface of the earth, and with yards equally low, and in the condition of the pools and docks above-mentioned; ſhould he, on entering theſe habi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, find them mingled with emigrants from va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious other climates, or with natives of that to which they had removed, equally debaſed, and perhaps ſtill more ſo, than themſelves—with people of diſcordant habits, colours, languages and countries,—and all, alike, inattentive to perſonal and houſehold cleanli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs;—I ſay, were a rational being to obſerve all this, and perceive all the circumſtances, juſt enume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, to be concurrent, in reſpect to time, would he, think you, find it neceſſary to recur to the Eaſt or to the Weſt-Indies, for cauſes of diſeaſe? Would he deem it of much importance whether a ſingle man died on board this, or that, veſſel? Or whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion might, or might not, be imported?—Would not theſe circumſtances, of themſelves, when viewed in connection with each other, and compared with the known and eſtabliſhed laws of health and diſeaſe, impreſs on his mind, with all the force of intuition, a conviction of the domeſtic origin of the Fever of 1795? Is it poſſible that he ſhould have any other opinion than that the cauſes, cure, and prevention, are equally local, and diſconnected with the preva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence or abſence of ſimilar diſeaſes in other countries? But, certain as I feel that this muſt be the inevitable concluſion from a candid attention to the facts above-diſplayed, I am pleaſed to be able to declare that it is unneceſſary to truſt to their teſtimony, alone, for ſupport to the opinion derived from their conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—<hi>No direct, no clear, evidence, ever has been, or can be, produced, in favor of the opinion that the Fever was imported.</hi>—I ſhall defer the attempt to ſubſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiate this aſſertion, to a future opportunity; in the mean time, permit me once more to remark—That,
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:031169_0099_0feb12a080251430"/>
though <hi>all</hi> the circumſtances, enumerated in this let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, as concurring to produce the Fever, did, often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, in reality concur, it is not to be ſuppoſed that they did ſo uniformly. So much is true, beyond diſpute—A concurrence of the greater number of ſome, or other, of them, was obſervable in a vaſt majority of the caſes of ſickneſs. More than this was not neceſſary:—for, expoſe the moſt temperate and cleanly native, to the full influence of all the cauſes prediſpoſing to this fever, beſide thoſe which his birth, cleanlineſs, and temperance, would diſarm, and his chance for continued health muſt have been ſmall; eſpecially, after the additional aid which they, queſtionleſs, derived from great numbers of ſick and dead, and from the reign of terror. The number of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives, of this deſcription, who died, was very inconſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derable; and, of thoſe few, perhaps there was not an individual whoſe ſituation, conſtitution, or office, did not peculiarly expoſe him to the attacks of the Fever. To which may be added, the chance of his falling a ſacrifice to an inert, or deſtructive practice.</p>

1795; or, more properly, on what is there reported to be the fact.—I ſhall quote, from this letter, the paſſage referred to.</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>On the 20th day of July, Doctor Malachi Treat, the late Health-Officer of this port, viſited the brig Zephyr, from Port-au-Prince; on board of which he found three perſons ill of fever, and the corpſe of one who died that morning. The Doctor calls the Fever, in his report, a Bilious-remitting Fever. The brig was ordered to ride quarantine. On the 22d day of July, Dr. Treat was taken ill, and died on the 30th, of a fever marked by a yellow ſkin, hemorrhages, vomiting of black matter, reſembling coffee-grounds, and all ſuch ſymptoms as charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terize bilious fevers of the malignant kind.—On the 25th day of July, four perſons, from on board the ſhip William, from Liverpool, which arrived here ſeveral weeks before (all the crew having, previous to that day, and during the voyage, been perfectly healthy) were taken ill of Fever, attended with ſimilar ſymptoms; and all died within ſeven days.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>This ſhip lay at a wharf at the foot of Dover-ſtreet, in the <hi>ſouth-eaſterly</hi>
                           <note n="*" place="bottom">A miſtake of the Preſs for—<hi>north-eaſterly.</hi>

reſide; and ever has ſuffered moſt from the regular autumnal diſeaſes, as well as from any new and uncommon complaint. From all which cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, we entertain no doubt but that the ſeamen of the ſhip William contracted the diſeaſe, of which they died, here, and did not introduce it into the city.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>A little before, and immediately after, the attack of the ſeamen of the ſhip William, which firſt called the attention of this Committee, ſeveral other perſons, in Water and Front-ſtreets, and in the neighborhood of Dover-ſtreet, were ſeized with fever, which, eſpecially in thoſe caſes which proved mortal, was marked by ſevere vomitings, a yellow ſkin, hemorrhagy, and, in ſome caſes, a vomiting a black matter, reſembling coffee-grounds,—and which generally terminated within ſeven days, and proved fatal to more, in proportion to the number ſeized, than is uſual in the ordinary complaints of the ſeaſon, in this city.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>Two remarks of conſiderable importance are natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſuggeſted by a careful examination of the above quotation: Firſt, that the Committee appear to have ſuppoſed Dr. Treat, alone, to have received the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of which he died, from the Zephyr; and, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that they have, in ſome ſort, admitted the poſſibility of ſuch a diſeaſe as the Fever of 1795, originating here, in their ſtatement of the circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances relative to the ſhip William. It is true that they are inexplicit, in both inſtances; and the only abſolute concluſion which we are juſtified in deduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from what they ſay is, that the diſeaſe was not introduced into this city by the ſhip William. This, however, narrows the ground of controverſy, conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derably; for no veſſels beſide the William and the
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0102_0feb12aa5422f7e0"/>
Zephyr, as far as I can learn, have ever been ſuſpected of introducing any diſeaſe, of this kind, into this city. It is neceſſary, therefore, only to diſprove the aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in reſpect to the Zephyr, and the whole founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the doctrine of importation is deſtroyed.— But, even were we to admit that Dr. Treat did actu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally derive the fever of which he died, from the Ze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyr, as no other perſon is known to have been in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by that veſſel, and as the doctor communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cated it to no perſon, the advocates for importation would not be greatly benefited by our conceſſion. But, no ſuch conceſſion is neceſſary. The following papers, copies of which I am kindly permitted to tranſmit to you, appear to me, to eſtabliſh it, beyond contradiction, that neither Dr. Treat, nor any other perſon, contracted a Fever, ſuch as prevailed in New-York, in 1795, from any ſick, or dead, man, or any thing elſe, connected with the veſſel in queſtion.</p>

The mate and one mariner had the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver and Ague ſeventeen days on ſhore, and came on board with the ſame diſeaſe; and the captain himſelf had a Dyſentery on his arrival in New-York;—and John Wheeler, aged 16 years, died on the day of the arrival of the brig at New-York, by worms crawling up into his throat and choaking him. He was ſewed up in a piece of canvaſs, and ready to be committed to the deep, when the late Health-Officer came on board, who deſired the captain to have the canvaſs opened, that he might inſpect the body—and he only cut the canvaſs open over the face, and viewed the countenance, but did not make any other examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the body,—which was, ſoon after, carried to Governor's Iſland, and there interred.—The young
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:031169_0104_0feb12b30aad4e90"/>
man who died as above-mentioned, had ſuffered chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nic complaints, but no fever of a dangerous nature.— Eighteen paſſengers came in the above brig, all in good health,—who have continued in this ſtate to the preſent day.—Three days after the above event, the Health-Officer viſited the ſame brig, in as good health as uſual.</p>

                     <p>OF the undoubted veracity of Captain Bird I am aſſured by Dr. Dingley, who is perſonally acquainted with him, and attended him, at the time, for the dyſentery mentioned in the depoſition. The opinion, therefore, that the Yellow Fever, or a contagious diſeaſe, was brought into the city, laſt year, by the brig Zephyr, ſeems wholly unſupported by evidence. Neither is it neceſſary that any imputation ſhould reſt on the memory of Dr. Treat. He ſaw the mariners after they had been long affected by the Fever and ague, and perhaps with ſome fever upon them at the time; and from the yellowneſs of the ſkin, common to the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vanced ſtate of that diſeaſe, eſpecially in hot climates, might be eaſily induced to ſuppoſe it a remittent. This, however, is mere conjecture, and not neceſſary to be admitted, ſince the fact of the men having been ſick ſeventeen days, previous to their embarking for our coaſt, is ample proof that their could not have been affected by the fever which prevailed and was
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:031169_0105_0feb12af15d95a70"/>
ſo mortal, here.—Indeed, the whole teſtimony in favor of the idea of importation, is too looſe and ſlight to build any rational opinion upon. The very words of the Committee are calculated to ſtrengthen a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary opinion, if rightly conſidered; for they not only countenance the idea that the people of the ſhip Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam became ſick from the unhealthineſs of the place where they dwelt, but, alſo, that the Fever had made its appearance, in various other of the neighboring houſes and ſtreets, previous to their being ſeized with it. And what confirms the truth of this opinion is, that perſons were taken with the diſtemper, about this time, in other parts of the city, who had no connection with the brig Zephyr, nor with any other veſſel, and whoſe illneſs may be ſatisfactorily ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted for from their ſituation, in other reſpects. An inſtance of this kind fell under my own obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the laſt of July; ſeveral ſimilar caſes have been related to me; and one, if I am not miſinformed, occurred in the New-York Alms-houſe, where the diſeaſe was diſtinctly marked, before Dr. Treat's ill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.—The following ſtatement of facts, too, will convince every candid mind, that we ought to look at home, for the cauſe of this Fever.</p>
                     <p>The ſhip Connecticut came to Fitch's wharf, about the 20th of July—I think it was on the 21ſt: ſhe had juſt arrived from ſome part of England, and the people were perfectly healthy. No veſſel ſuſpected of being infected, came to this wharf, during the ſeaſon; though the ſhip William lay at the next wharf, at the diſtance of about two hundred feet,—and Mr. Fitch gives the moſt poſitive aſſuran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces that all the articles in his ſtore, at this time, were in good condition. At this wharf the ſhip Connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticut continued till after the middle of Auguſt. The owner was employed about the ſhip, great part of
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:031169_0106_0feb12b4ad9f5240"/>
the day; but ate and ſlept in an airy part of the town. The people of the ſhip either ſtayed on board, or at public houſes near by.—On the evening of the 25th of July, the owner was ſeized with the fever; I ſaw him the 27th; he had good accommodations, was in a favorable part of the town, in the third ſtory of the houſe, and recovered after an illneſs of about ten days, which was never very dangerous, though the attack was ſevere.—About this time, one of the mates, the ſteward, and two of the mariners, of the ſhip Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut, were ſeized in the ſame way, and with the ſame ſymptoms, as the owner. They continued in the ſhip, or its neighborhood, and all died. I did not ſee them, but was informed, by the owner, that the mate, in particular, <hi>vomited large quantities of blood, and expired delirious.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Three perſons, who were in Mr. Fitch's ſtore, were taken ſick, and two died, of the Fever. One ſickened on the 26th of July, one on the 6th, and the other on the 9th of Auguſt. It was common for all theſe perſons to ſit <q>ſeveral hours, in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in the ſtore, with empty ſtomachs,—inhaling the effluvia of the night.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>One of the firſt perſons, who died of the Fever, was one <q>who lived at the head of the wharf, and had been confined for ſeveral months with a rheu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>matic complaint.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>For the facts contained in the two laſt paragraphs, I am indebted to a communication from Mr. Fitch to Dr. Dingley, which that gentleman has allowed me to make uſe of on this occaſion. The account which it contains of the condition of the wharves in his neighborhood, adds new force to the other teſtimony in favor of the opinion that the Fever originated here; and is too much to the purpoſe to be omitted. Theſe are his words:—</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="103" facs="unknown:031169_0107_0feb12b7a9550630"/>
                        <q>I am poſitive that the diſorder has originated from local cauſes—becauſe, it has appeared in this quarter, at the ſame ſeaſon, for ſeveral years paſt: the cauſe why it has is, to me, myſterious; but what appears to me moſt probable is, the central ſituation, and the motion of the tides. The tide of flood ſets directly into theſe wharves; col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting all the vapors and effluvia of the city.— The ſituation of the ground, between Water and Cherry-ſtreets, is rendered noxious by raiſing Water-ſtreet, and confining the ſtagnant waters.— The emptying of tubs into the head of the docks, inſtead of the end of the wharves, although not peculiar to this part of the city, is a horrible nui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſance; particularly in time of ſickneſs.—The pon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of water, by running a bulk-head athwart a dock, and leaving the vacancy for years, to be filled up with every ſpecies of filth and putridity, is an object worth your attention.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>A confirmation of the facts, and ſome of the opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nions, contained in this extract, may be found in a very ſingular epiſtle from the late Dr. W<hi rend="sup">m.</hi> Pitt Smith, to Dr. Duffield ſen. of Philadelphia, dated Septem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber 1ſt, 1795; which I preſume you have ſeen and are poſſeſſed of.</p>
                     <p>On the whole, though I am not prepared to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain that infectious diſeaſes, and the Yellow Fever among others, may not be, and have not been, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, and thus ſpread over parts of our country, yet this is the moſt that can be allowed to the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenancers of the doctrine. For, after all, the teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony of numerous facts furniſhes clear, indubitable, and deciſive evidence, that other and peculiar cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances muſt concur with ſuch importation, to
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:031169_0108_0feb12baa82fd780"/>
effect any general diſtribution, circulation, or influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the diſeaſe. Frequent inſtances have occurred, nay do occur every year, of perſons returning, from the Weſt-Indies, ſick with the Yellow Fever; lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing, for ſome time, in the houſes of their pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, or friends; recovering, or dying; attended by numbers, during their illneſs; their very clothes, where they have died, afterwards worn by their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations; and yet no ill effects following therefrom.— While I reſided at Wethersfield, in Connecticut, I had opportunity of obtaining preciſe information of ſeveral ſuch caſes; and it is a well-eſtabliſhed fact, in many inſtances during our Fever, and eſpecially dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that of Philadelphia, in 1793.</p>
                     <p>The whole, therefore, that can be granted, or ought to be aſſumed by thoſe who maintain the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe which prevailed in New-York in 1795, to have been imported is,—That infection may be brought into any place (and therefore into this city) from abroad; that, under certain circumſtances of the place, where it is introduced, it becomes very active and deſtructive; but that, when theſe circumſtances do not exiſt, however the perſon immediately af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected,—if it be introduced by a ſick perſon—may ſuffer, it is harmleſs, ſo far as the general health of that place is concerned.—If the ſubject were viewed in this light, as moſt aſſuredly it ought to be, the queſtion of importation, or non-importation, would ſink into it's merited inſignificance; the efficient cauſe, the <hi>cauſa fine qua non,</hi> of ſuch Fevers, would be clearly diſcerned as depending on local circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, capable of being wholly changed; the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute madneſs of further delay, in effecting ſuch a change, would be diſtinctly and deeply felt; a becom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpirit would animate the citizens; and ſuitable exertions ſpeedily place us beyond the poſſibility of
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:031169_0109_0feb12bd75fabda8"/>
being ſubjected to a misfortune, ſimilar to that which has been already ſuſtained. For it is inconceivable that the nature and extent of the evil ſhould be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and the remedy not be applied: and a comparatively ſlight and temporaly ſacrifice of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, would render this city, in reality, what the miſtaken policy, or pride, of ſome of its inhabitants now falſely repreſent it,—as healthy as any in the world; and leave nothing to fear, either from the Fevers of the Indies, or the Plague of the Levant.—But, while people continue to foſter a ridiculous vanity, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the city in which they reſide; while they fear that its reputation will be wounded, by permitting an idea to get abroad, that it is unhealthy; while thoſe engaged in commerce cheriſh the error, from an apprehenſion that their intereſts would ſuffer from a diſcloſure of the truth; while men, inveſted with the ſacred character of phyſicians, countenance falſe opinions, either through ignorance, a reprehenſible ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>midity, or that they may gather undeſerved popularity and wealth; and while the magiſtracy are more actuated by a mean regard for offices dependent on popular opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, and maintained by a compliance with it, at all hazards, than by a juſt and enlightened zeal for the ſafety and happineſs of their fellow-citizens; Truth may be ſpoken, but there is no hope that it will be attended to. Conſiderations of <hi>ſuppoſed</hi> intereſt, ſo various and ſo forcible, take deep root in the minds of men who look only to the preſent moment, and are either incapable of comprehending the whole of a ſubject, or unwilling to beſtow on it the neceſſary conſideration. Thus circumſtanced, they ſtrive to baniſh from others, and to ſmother in their own breaſts, thoſe convictions which irreſiſtible evidence forces upon them: as if it were poſſible that truth could be noxious.—Nothing can be more melancho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly than to obſerve this wilful blindneſs, this obſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate perſiſtency in error, the conſequences of which
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:031169_0110_0feb12c04815c360"/>
have been ſo dreadful already, and threaten to be ſtill more ſo hereafter.—Were it poſſible to impreſs the truth vividly on the minds of the great body of citizens; to rouze men into action; to excite a generous diſregard for temporary advantages, and a lively intereſt for the future welfare of themſelves and their poſterity; a few weeks might enable us to bid defiance to death, in many of the forms in which he now aſſails us.</p>

                     <p>HAVING determined, to my own ſatisfaction at leaſt, what were the remote or prediſpoſing cauſes of the Fever of 1795, I might now proceed to a deſcription of the diſeaſe itſelf, were it not proper to take ſome notice of two queſtions, which have been conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion agitated, viz. Whether the Fever was, as the Health Committee term it, an Epidemic?—And, as ſome ſuppoſe, Contagious?—On both theſe queſtions, I ſhall deliver my opinion, in as ſuccinct a manner as the ſubject will permit.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Was the Fever epidemic?</hi>—A principal difficulty oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curs in the very outſet of this enquiry; for different writers have made uſe of the term Epidemic, diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rently; ſome giving it a <hi>general,</hi> others a more <hi>particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar</hi> and <hi>preciſe</hi> ſignification. Thus Van Swieten, in his Commentary on the 1380th Aphoriſm of Boerhaave, places <hi>epidemic</hi> in contradiſtinction to <hi>endemic;</hi> while Cleghorn, a writer of deſerved authority, in the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduction to his Obſervations on the Diſeaſes, &amp;c.
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:031169_0111_0feb12c3620dc9e8"/>
of Minorca, p. 74. conſtitutes a claſs of <hi>endemic</hi> diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes, which he divides into <hi>epidemic</hi> and <hi>ſporadic.</hi>— Examples of like diſſimilarities, in the uſe of theſe words, are frequently to be met with, in authors of equal credit. And thus it may poſſibly happen, in the preſent inſtance, as on many former occaſions, that the whole contention ariſes from different con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptions of the import of a particular word.—But our buſineſs is rather with facts, than with definitions; I ſhall ſtate to you, therefore, what appears to me to have been the truth; and, perhaps, in the concluſion of my ſtatement, a definition will be found.</p>
                     <p>In the firſt place, every perſon converſant with the practice of phyſic in New-York, knows that a Fever, generally of the remittent or continued kind, and va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly denominated by medical writers, prevails in this city, to a greater or leſs degree, every year; per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps I may ſay throughout the year—but, certainly, in every part of it, except the winter, and particularly from July to December: its greateſt height being in the months of Auguſt, September and October. The violence of this diſeaſe is increaſed or diminiſhed by conſtitutional peculiarities, and by the particular ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of the patient in reſpect to air, temperature, &amp;c. &amp;c. Its univerſality, likewiſe, may be conſidered as dependent, in a degree, on the ſame cauſes.—Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances, peculiar to ſome ſituations or individuals, occaſion it to prove mortal, with high marks of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lignity, in certain inſtances, almoſt every year. That an extenſion of theſe peculiarities, ſo as to make them common to the citizens generally, would pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the ſame effects on the many, as on the few, ſeems hardly controvertible. Now, this appears, to me, to have been the caſe, the laſt year; and I have no doubt of the identity of the Fever which then raged here, with that which has prevailed here in
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0112_0feb12c65b7da4b8"/>
former years; and conſider it only as a higher grade of the ſame diſeaſe.—Compare the hiſtory of Fevers, in Sheffield, with that of Fevers in New-York.—We have a Fever, every year, at a particular ſeaſon, uſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally called the bilious-remitting Fever: in Sheffield, at the ſame ſeaſon, a Fever prevails, called the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitting Fever. This laſt evidently depends on the peculiarities of Sheffield—ſuch as its ponds, marſhes, &amp;c.—So, in my opinion, does the former ariſe from the peculiarities of New-York.—The ſeaſon of 1795 was a remarkable one: Was there any apparent change in the Fever of Sheffield? Yes: the ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms were remarkably heightened; ſome new ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances were obſervable; and the diſeaſe aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly obſtinate. And was not this, alſo, true of New-York? Who will venture to deny it?—Were either of theſe Fevers propagated to other, or neighboring, places? No. You have certified this of the Fever in Sheffield; and I have heard of no inſtance of the kind, in relation to that of New-York. Both Fevers, then, were <hi>proper</hi> to the places in which they prevailed; and the inference which it would be natural to deduce from this is, that both were <hi>endemic,</hi> and not <hi>epidemic:</hi> for the term epidemic ſeems to include in it the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pability of diffuſion or propagation, without reſpect to the ſituation and conſtitution of the patient; which the term endemic certainly does not. But, which<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever of theſe titles may be regarded as moſt appropri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate, the fact will not be varied by the uſe of either; and that you will underſtand to be, according to my belief, as above-ſtated. That the Fever of 1795 was no other than a higher grade of that which prevails here, in the ſame ſeaſon, every year; deriving its ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verity entirely from the peculiarities of the ſeaſon, &amp;c. as related, at large, in the preceding letters.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="unknown:031169_0113_0feb12ca54b9c940"/>
                        <hi>Was the Fever contagious?</hi> Concerning the anſwer to be made to this, as well as to the former queſtion, there has been ſome diſpute; but, in this caſe, as in that, as much difficulty has ariſen in ſettling the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the phraſeology, as in determining the fact.</p>
                     <p>If by the queſtion it is meant to inquire, whether the well became affected with the Fever, in conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of the contact of a ſick perſon, or the cloath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of a ſick perſon, or from the performance of the offices of friendſhip, charity, and meniality, to thoſe who were ſick,—I anſwer that no ſuch caſes have come to my knowledge; whereas numerous inſtances of ſuch contact fell under my obſervation, and have been related to me, to which no ill effects ſucceeded.</p>
                     <p>A number of perſons, not leſs than ten or twelve, removed, with the Fever on them, from New-York to Stamford, 40 miles; but no perſon in Stamford, beſide them, ever had the diſorder.</p>
                     <p>Mr. Fitch, the gentleman mentioned in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceding letter, attended the young men who had the diſeaſe with him, and to uſe his own words, <q>lodged in the bed, warm with the effluvia of the body of the young man who died at his houſe</q>—and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vertheleſs, he had no Fever.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Treat, according to the account of the Health-Committee, and of his phyſicians, died of the very worſt degree of the Fever; yet he communicated it to nobody.</p>
                     <p>A patient of Dr. Dingley's, in Ferry-ſtreet, who was ſeized with the diſeaſe, without any previous communication with any ſick perſon, and as early as the 17th of Auguſt, and who died with it, commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicated it to none of his attendants. And the ſame is true of ſeveral other patients of the ſame gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man.</p>

                        <pb facs="unknown:031169_0114_0feb12cbf5ef2100"/>The writer of ſome ingenious ſtrictures on Dr. Mitchill's Pamphlet, remarks, in a note ſubjoined to his firſt paper, that he has, <q>in common with many of <hi>his</hi> fellow-practitioners, indulged, <hi>without the ſmalleſt ill effect,</hi> a much more frequent intercourſe with <hi>his</hi> patients, in this diſeaſe, than uſual,</q> &amp;c. And the Doctor himſelf, though he admits the poſſibility of ſuch fevers becoming contagious, or being propagated by contact, &amp;c. expreſsly denies the Fever of 1795 to have been ſo.</p>
                     <p>But there would be no end to an enumeration of ſimilar facts; I ſhall only add, therefore, that I made uſe of no precaution whatever, in reſpect to ſuch com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication with patients; that I have been, for more than two hours, ſhut up in a ſmall room, with a per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon laboring under the worſt ſymptoms of the Fever; have watched ſeveral nights, and performed the moſt ſervile offices, with a near friend, who was ſick with it; and never ſuſtained the leaſt inconvenience from ſuch expoſures<note n="*" place="bottom">I might ſuperadd to all this, the <hi>ambiguous</hi> teſtimony of another Phyſician, who, in proof of the uninfectious nature of the Fever, affirmed that he had <q>had thirty patients with it, and had <hi>taken the breath of all of them.</hi>
                           </q>
                        </note>.</p>
                     <p>But, perhaps the advocates for the Contagious, or Infectious, nature of the diſeaſe under conſideration, do not intend to confine the meaning of the term Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tagion to that ſubſtance, whatever it is, which is ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerated in an unhealthy body, and by application to a ſound body, excites in it a ſimilar unhealthineſs. They may mean to deſcribe, or deſignate, by it, that ſtructure, conſtitution, or vice, of the atmoſphere, which diſpoſes to, or excites diſeaſe. If ſo, they are in fault—for they employ the ſame term to deſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate two different facts.—But let us not diſpute
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:031169_0115_0feb12cec83fadd8"/>
about words. Perhaps, the following ſtatement of my opinions, will lead us to the formation or attain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of ſome more accurate notions on this point.</p>
                     <p>Owing to a variety of cauſes, which have been enumerated in the courſe of theſe letters, I ſuppoſe the atmoſphere of New-York to have become vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiated, in 1795, to an uncommon degree: that there was either an unuſual abſence of that principle neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary to ſupport healthy life, or an extraordinary con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>centration, diffuſion, or quantity, of ſome other, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>friendly to healthy life. From the operation of one, or other, of theſe ſtates of the atmoſphere, and of the cauſes above-mentioned, on the bodies of the reſidents in this city, I ſuppoſe a prediſpoſition, greater or leſs, according to the ſituation and other circumſtances of individuals, was formed, in the citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, generally, to the Fever which prevailed here that year. With ſome perſons, this condition of the atmoſphere, of itſelf, might be ſufficient to produce in them diſeaſe. But, ordinarily, I believe, the aid of ſome cauſe, which ſhould diſturb the regularity of the diſtributions, or functions, of the body, was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired to bring the ſyſtem into a ſtate of febrile ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

Though, on perſons coming into the city, from abroad, it doubtleſs operated with much greater force, in many caſes, than on the citizens, at any time. This is eaſily accounted for, from the known effects of cuſtom. For

                     <p>The ſyſtems of thoſe who continued here became habituated to the atmoſphere; and while thoſe who came here from the country, with ruddy faces, ſunk down in death, the pale and yellow beings who ſtalked through our ſtreets, derided diſeaſe, and purſued their cuſtomary occupations.—But, to return from this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion.</p>
                     <p>Not only am I convinced of the accuracy of the preceding ideas, but I have no doubt that this vice of the atmoſphere was rendered ſtill greater by exhala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions from the bodies of the ſick—It is a point well-eſtabliſhed in medicine, that the air of a room is rendered unſuitable for reſpiration, if a num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of healthy perſons are obliged to breathe it over ſeveral times, without the admiſſion of freſh air from abroad. So injurious is ſuch a confinement, in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpect to air, to the human body, that it has, in nume<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous inſtances, produced terrible febrile diſeaſes. And if ſuch effects ariſe from the repeated breathing over the ſame, or nearly the ſame, air, by healthy perſons, we ſhould naturally conclude, as is the fact, that ſuch repeated reſpiration (eſpecially when united with the conſtant exhalation from their bodies) by the ſick, muſt be ſtill more pernicious to health.—You will pardon me for the introduction of remarks ſo trite and familiar, for the ſake of the uſe I wiſh to make of them; which is no other than this—I have mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:031169_0117_0feb12d592787848"/>
it as my belief that the ſtate of the atmoſphere was ſuch, in this city, the laſt year, as, in conjunction with the general influence of the cauſes producing that ſtate, to prediſpoſe to, and, in ſome inſtances, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, the Fever; and that this ill-conditioned atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere was rendered ſtill more noxious by means of the numbers who became ſick, in the courſe of the ſeaſon; and to this I would add, for the reaſons con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the remarks above, that I think it not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probable that ſome were affected with the Fever, in conſequence of the further vitiation of the atmoſphere by the ſick, who, without that circumſtance, would have remained free from diſeaſe. So, likewiſe, there may be perſons, the balance of whoſe health is ſo tre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mulouſly ſenſible to every external influence, as to preponderate to the ſide of diſeaſe, on the ſlighteſt impulſe of its cauſes. With ſuch, the mere contact of a ſick perſon, or a tranſitory expoſure to the efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via ariſing from a ſick body, may be ſufficient to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce Fever; and inſtances of this kind may have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened, in the courſe of the Fever in queſtion. Such caſes, however, muſt have been extremely rare, if there were any; and no one has ever come to my knowledge.—But, with regard to Fevers produced by ſuch a ſtate of the air, as above-deſcribed, even when aided by the mixture of human effluvia, ariſing from ſick bodies,—if theſe are to be called Contagious di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeaſes, and the cauſe which excited them Contagion, ſo, likewiſe, may all other Fevers on the ſame principle, continued, remitting, intermitting, Fevers,—be called Contagious, and their cauſes, as marſh miaſmata, &amp;c, Contagion.—Now, to ſuch a uſe of terms I have not the leaſt objection, provided the perſon who employs them, be uniform and explicit in his application of them.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb n="114" facs="unknown:031169_0118_0feb12d735c46780"/>To conclude,—If, in ſpeaking of the Fever of 1795, the epithet Contagious is meant to expreſs that it was communicated by contact, &amp;c. like the Small<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pox, Meazles and Plague, I muſt repeat it, I find no good reaſon for admitting this to have been the fact; but, for the reaſons before alledged, I think there is juſt ground for a belief that the Fever was never ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited in this way. But if, on the other hand, the term Contagion be meant to convey an idea of the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the atmoſphere to prediſpoſe to, or pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce, diſeaſe,—whether that influence ariſe from the abſtraction, or addition, of a principle, or be diſtinct from human effluvia, or combined with them—there appears no reaſon for denying the Fever of 1795 to have been Contagious.—Still, as the term Contagion is not generally uſed in a ſenſe to reſtricted, as in this ſecond inſtance, but is often employed by the ſame writer, to expreſs both the cauſe of the diſeaſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated by contact, &amp;c. and of that produced by the influence of the atmoſphere, there ſeems to be a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety in rejecting it altogether, in the preſent inſtance, or at leaſt in confining the uſe of it, to deſignate a ſingle mode of producing diſeaſe; and, according as it is applied in the former or latter inſtance, the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of 1795 may be denominated Contagious, or the reverſe.</p>
                     <p>I have now gone through with the conſideration of all the ſubjects, preliminary to an account of the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe itſelf.

                        <hi>LETTER EIGHTH.</hi> Some Account of the Symptoms of the Fever of <hi>1795.</hi>
                     </head>
                     <p>AFTER the frequent confeſſions, which occur in the preceding letters, of the circumſcribed ſphere of my obſervation, it were preſumptuous in me to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to deliver a regular hiſtory of the ſymptoms of the Fever of 1795. You will obſerve, from the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count which I ſhall tranſmit to you, that the appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ances it exhibited were too various to authorize ſuch an attempt in any one who had not opportunity to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine them, in relation to numbers of the ſick. It is proper, therefore, that I warn you, once more, to conſider what is here delivered as the reſult of my own obſervation only—except where it is expreſsly mentioned to be otherwiſe.</p>
                     <p>The Fever of 1795 was, generally, ſudden in its acceſs; ſo much ſo, in ſome inſtances, as to reſemble convulſions. In a leſs number of caſes, it came on gradually, and after a ſlowly-increaſing illneſs of ſeveral days. It began with great pain of the head, heat and redneſs of the face, and fullneſs and redneſs of the eyes, accompanied by a ſtrong, full, tenſe, pulſe, and an almoſt univerſal coſtiveneſs. Pains in the back and limbs were common; but not as much ſo as of the head. A great inquietude, or anxiety, of the ſtomach and breaſt, was common; approaching, ſometimes, to ſyncope, and ſometimes a vomiting, which ſoon ceaſed, or continued, at in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tervals, through the diſorder.—The Fever which now commenced was rarely uſhered in by a chill, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0120_0feb12dcd082d268"/>
for a greater or leſſer period, according to circumſtances, with ſo many varieties and combina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ſymptoms, as to render it impoſſible to purſue a regular deſcription. I ſhall, therefore, diſpoſe my remarks under ſeveral heads; preſerving as much connection as circumſtances will permit.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. Though the <hi>pulſe</hi> was generally full, ſtrong, and tenſe, in the beginning of the Fever, it was not always ſo. It was ſometimes weak and low, but ſtill tenſe—if it be proper to uſe this term, to point out a condition of the pulſe, as it appears to me, wholly peculiar to this Fever. I well remember that, in a youth of 12, or 13, years of age, the pulſe became much fuller after a plentiful bleeding; though he was of a feeble conſtitution, and had been ſlightly affected with the Fever once before.—In two gentlemen, who were conſiderably affected by the Fever, for ſeveral weeks, but not to ſuch a degree as to be confined to their beds, this peculiar pulſe was very diſtinguiſhable; as much ſo, I think, as in any other perſons whoſe pulſe I examined.</p>
                     <p>Hemorrhages, from various parts of the body, were frequent, eſpecially in the advanced ſtage of the diſeaſe, and where it had been violent from the firſt. Theſe were from the noſe, fauces, eſpecially the gums, from punctures made in bloodletting, and from the ſtomach: I ſaw no other. Bleeding from the noſe and fauces often occurred in the beginning of the diſeaſe, and was removable by the general reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies. Bleedings from the punctures made in blood<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>letting, were ſeen in the cloſe of the diſeaſe, and were reſtrained with the greateſt difficulty. I recollect to have been conſtantly engaged in an attempt to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain ſuch a hemorrhage, in company with another phyſician, two of the moſt melancholy hours I ever
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0121_0feb12e0ca6719e8"/>
experienced. Hemorrhagy from the ſtomach I ſhall mention more particularly hereafter.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. Symptoms of pulmonic affection were not un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>common; though I do not recollect to have obſerved them till the laſt of September, or beginning of Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tober. They ſometimes roſe nearly to the height of pneumonia.</p>
                     <p>Hiccough was a troubleſome ſymptom, and often accompanied vomiting; and there was ſometimes, as it appeared to me, a mingled hiccoughing and belch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. The marks of congeſtion in the brain were too numerous and unequivocal to be miſtaken.—A vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent pain in the head was one of the earlieſt, moſt conſtant, and moſt diſtreſſing, ſymptoms of this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe—Coma was a very frequent ſymptom; and, as I thought, in proportion to the ſeverity of the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der. Towards the cloſe, it amounted almoſt to total ſtupefaction; it being ſcarcely poſſible to rouſe the patient. Some degree of delirium was common; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly at the commencement of an exacerbation of the Fever; manifeſting itſelf in the hurried manner in which the patient performed any action, and in the rambling manner in which he converſed. That kind of delirium which ſome have called <hi>light-headedneſs,</hi> was remarkably preſent, in one perſon, at the cloſe of his diſorder. He often ſtarted up, wildly, without any apparent object, then lay down, and commenced ſinging, in an interrupted, incoherent manner; but without any violence. And the day before his death, he continued to ſing, with ſlight intervals, more than an hour.—At other times, he would fix on ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular words, and repeat them over and over; ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, with no appearance of emotion; at others,
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0122_0feb12e26d72cbd0"/>
with ſome glimmering of conſciouſneſs.—In another perſon, a patient of a phyſician of my acquaintance, the affection of the brain was like that in Phrenitis. A bliſtering-plaſter applied, if I remember accurately, for 24 hours, to the head, which had been ſhaven, excited no veſſication, and ſcarcely any redneſs, though twice the uſual quantity of cantharides was incorporated, and the patient was of a delicate ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bit. In this caſe the affection of the brain took place on the third day, and the patient died on the fifth or ſixth.—On examination and diſſection of the contents of the cranium, all the membranes, and the very ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of the brain, were diſcovered to be in a remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and uncommon ſtate of inflammation.—I have been the more particular in relating this caſe, as it ſeems to contradict, in a degree, the ideas of Dr. Ruſh, p. 50, of his Hiſtory of the Philadelphia Fever: our ſeaſon having been unuſually <hi>wet.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>As connected with the ſtate of the brain, it may be proper to mention here, that the <hi>eyes</hi> were often ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed, the whites of them tinged with yellow, and the ſmall veſſels turgid with blood. In ſome patients they had an expreſſion of ſingular wildneſs; while, in others, there was a remarkable vacuity, or abſence of expreſſion.—I ſaw no inſtance of ſquinting; nor ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved any uncommon ſtate of the pupil: but I ought to acknowledge that my attention was not particularly directed to the condition of the eyes, in this reſpect.</p>
                     <p>The ſtate of the mind was very variable. Some were exceedingly impatient and iraſcible; others, aſtoniſhingly obſtinate; and this particularly, when, as was often the caſe, there was a loſs of memory, or ſome degree of mania. A ſtrong appeal to their good-ſenſe, calling them by name, ſeemed to effect a tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary reſtoration of their docility and recollection,—
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0123_0feb12e566ea3438"/>
which were ſoon loſt.—Many were very confident, at firſt, ſuppoſing their illneſs not be the Fever; but gave themſelves up to deſpair, immediately on being convinced that it was the Fever. Many were full of dreadful apprehenſions, from the firſt; and often<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times, exceedingly aggravated what would have been, otherwiſe, a ſlight diſeaſe. A few, were calm, col<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, undaunted, throughout their ſickneſs. And here it may not be unſeaſonable to remark, that theſe ſame varieties were, in a degree, obſervable in thoſe who continued well. Some phyſicians thought they could diſcern a tendency, among the citizens, gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally, to mania. It is certain that fear was a terrible evil, and frequently proved the exciting cauſe of the Fever.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. I have remarked that a great anxiety at the <hi>ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach</hi> was ſometimes felt, on the patient's being firſt ſeiz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Fever. This anxiety, it may now be added, in ſome caſes, extended through the complaint; but was moſt diſtreſſing when the Fever was moſt violent. A great ſenſe of ſoreneſs was often complained of, when any thing was taken into the ſtomach, <hi>as if it were raw;</hi>—to uſe the words of one in whom it was ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. In ſome, the ſenſibility of this organ was ſo exceſſive as to make it almoſt impoſſible to adminiſter, either food or medicine, by the mouth.</p>
                     <p>Patients were often afflicted with extreme pain in the bowels; but more reſembling that in dyſentery, than in cholic. A diſcharge, generally, afforded a preſent relief.</p>
                     <p>Flatulency, both of the ſtomach and bowels, was almoſt univerſal, and to an extraordinary degree.— The abdomen was ſometimes diſtended with wind;
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:031169_0124_0feb12e883516938"/>
but the diſtenſion ſubſided after a conderable diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of wind, downwards. This was often the caſe in one of my patients.</p>
                     <p>Several diſſections, as I am informed by the gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman principally concerned in them, ſhew the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach to have been in a remarkable ſtate of inflamma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and excoriation. It appears to me that this diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe of the ſtomach, or inflammation—(if it be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per to call it ſo) extended through the whole length of the Alimentary Canal; as it is known to do in Apthae and ſome other diſorders; for one caſe of excoriation and partial mortification of the Rectum came within my knowlege, and I have heard of ſeveral others.</p>
                     <p>I have mentioned, above, that Coſtiveneſs was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt univerſal at the commencement of the Fever; but it was not always preſent. For though it was obſervable in the greater number of patients, ſo much ſo as to deſerve to be ranked among the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſtic ſigns of the diſeaſe; and though a conſtant tendency to a coſtive ſtate, was general in thoſe ſick with the diſorder; yet, in ſome, the Fever was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended from the firſt, or for a while, by a Diarrhea; and in one inſtance, the whole of the Diſeaſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared to me to be turned upon the bowels, and to be converted into, or aſſume the form of a Diar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rhea.</p>
                     <p>Some were ſeized with vomiting at the firſt, which was ſoon ſtopped, or ceaſed ſpontaneouſly, and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver returned. One caſe of this kind, proved favora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble—the patient recovering; another unfavorable, the patient dying.—In others, vomiting commenced the diſeaſe, and continued through it: while in others, again, it came on in the courſe, or at the
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0125_0feb12ec725d3040"/>
cloſe of the diſorder; and this both in ſucceſsful and unſucceſsful caſes.</p>
                     <p n="5">V. The matters vomited up varied in colour and conſiſtence, in different perſons, and in different pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riods of the diſeaſe. The moſt common was of a yellowiſh, greeniſh, or a muddy green and yellow, appearance, and very fluid. Vomitings of this kind, were ſeen both in thoſe who recovered, and who died; and were both temporary and continued.— Next, in frequency, was that of a blackiſh appearance, commonly deſcribed as reſembling coffee-grounds, but bearing a nearer reſemblance to blood partly burnt, and diluted with muddy water. Several who had this vomiting recovered.—I never ſaw an inſtance of that tar-like vomit, which has been noticed by ſome writers. But, of all others, that which ſtruck me as evidential of the greateſt derangement of the ſtomach, was the vomiting up of, what appeared to be, thin blood, in which floated a flaky, filmy ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance, which I ſuppoſe to have been the villous coat of the ſtomach.—This I ſaw but in a ſingle inſtance, a few hours before death. This diſcharge was fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent, though ſmall; and accompanied by a large worm.</p>
                     <p>I cannot help thinking that the matters vomited up, except it be thoſe of the yellowiſh or greeniſh caſt, have all a portion of blood mingled with them; and that their various appearances depend—aſide from their mixture with the contents of the ſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mach—in great meaſure, on the quantity of blood mingled with them. It appears to me that, in this diſeaſe, the ſecretion of the Bile is greatly affected; and that, in many inſtances, the blood itſelf paſſes into the biliary veſſels, charged with the Bile, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to have been ſeparated, and being poured in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0126_0feb12ee18016a90"/>
the duodenum, and diſcharged by ſtool or vomit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, communicates the blackneſs obſerved in thoſe evacuations. Beſide this, as appears from diſſection, and from the caſe juſt mentioned, the coats of the ſtomach itſelf are deſtroyed; and the numerous little veſſels, which, in a healthy ſtate, diſtill into it a limpid and colourleſs fluid, now are preternaturally diſtended, receive the blood, inſtead of lymph, and pour it, by their numerous orifices, into this organ. This effuſion of blood may be ſuppoſed to increaſe, as the diſeaſe increaſes in violence, till, at length, the tender coats of the ſtomach are ſeparated, and thrown up, mingled with pure blood.—If theſe ideas be juſt, it is clear that no vomiting can be more evidential of a fatal termination of the diſeaſe, than this; none can afford a more unequivocal ſign to the phyſician, that his attention is no longer uſeful<note n="*" place="bottom">
                           <p>If the ideas contained in the above paragraph are accurate, they will tend to confirm both the general notions of the diſeaſe, and of the proper mode of cure, advanced in theſe letters. For—</p>
                           <p n="1">1ſt. The effect of Blood-letting, in ſtopping the <hi>black-vomit,</hi> may be explained on the ſame principle as in Hemoptoe—by weakening the circulation, and allowing time for coagulation.</p>
                           <p n="2">2d. The reaſon why all ſtimulating ſubſtances increaſe the particular diſcharges from the ſtomach, is evident; and, alſo, why cold drinks, ice, &amp;c. reſtrain them.</p>
                           <p n="3">3d. The aſtoniſhing fluidity, or diſſolution, as it is called, of the blood is accounted for, and ſeen fairly to correſpond with the preceding circumſtances: all of which—</p>

                        </note>.</p>
                     <p>The diſcharges from the bowels were very dark, in general, even where no preparation of mercury was uſed. They were, likewiſe, in moſt caſes, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably fluid, where the bowels had been once.

thoroughly, opened; and, where the purgatives were briſk, and in all ſevere caſes, exceſſively offenſive.— They were, ſometimes, of a dark, ſhining appearance, ſomewhat like molaſſes, melted pitch, or black-lead. But I have ſeen ſtools of this colour, in other diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſes—particularly once in the Croup—where calo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel was frequently uſed as a purge.—I mention this, as it may ſometimes happen, that phyſicians deceive themſelves, in ſuch caſes, aſcribing that to the diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, which depends on medicines.</p>
                     <p>Some were troubled, with a retention of urine; but, more generally, with an unuſual flow; and this in one inſtance, I diſtinctly recollect, where the quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of fluids taken into the body, was very ſmall.</p>
                     <p>In reſpect to ſweating, I diſcovered nothing uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form. In one caſe, the patient always had a profuſe, clammy, ſweat, when he fell into a reſtleſs ſleep, with a riſe of fever. This was often obſervable, likewiſe, in that ſtate of remarkable anxiety which frequently preceded an evacuation by ſtool.</p>
                     <p>Blood drawn in this Fever, was remarkably want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in floridity; and this was eſpecially true of that which was evacuated in the cloſe of the diſeaſe— whether by art, or ſpontaneous effuſion. In one in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance it ſeemed endowed with a cauſtic quality, and affected a lancet ſo as to leave a permanent inequality and diſcolouration of its ſurface.</p>
                     <p n="6">VI. Sleep, for the moſt part, appeared unnatural and unrefreſhing; attended by great reſtleſſneſs; and ſometimes by great mobility of the muſcles, twitch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the tendons, and frequent ſtarting up. One of my patients often raiſed himſelf up, ſuddenly, out of bed, with every appearance of extraordinary ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror;
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:031169_0128_0feb12f42f8131a0"/>
but with no evident or clear conſciouſneſs of the act. In one perſon, I ſaw remarkable <hi>ſubſultus tendi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num.</hi>

                     <p>There was great variety in muſcular power, in dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent perſons. A man who died with the very worſt ſymptoms of the Fever, the evening before his death, roſe from his bed, ran down two flights of ſtairs, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned, and was only prevented from going down a ſecond time by his nurſe's having locked him in his chamber.—In another caſe, where the diſeaſe was mild, the patient felt perfectly eaſy and compoſed, and in full poſſeſſion of mental and corporeal ſtrength, while he lay on his bed; but, when he roſe, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted to walk, a ſenſe of univerſal anxiety was felt, his ideas became confuſed, his ſtrength ſeemed to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert him, a ſudden faintneſs came over him, and twice he ſunk down, unable to proceed.</p>
                     <p>An evacuation, by ſtool, often ſuddenly reſtored the patient, who was lifted from bed, to ſuch a degree of ſtrength, that he continued for ſome time after, to walk about the room, or ſit up.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. I noticed no uncommon ſenſibility to light but in a ſingle caſe; and that was not of long dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
                     <p>Hearing, in one inſtance, I obſerved to be unuſually acute; but generally, it was much impaired; and, ſometimes, ſeemed to be entirely loſt. Perhaps this may account for the apparent loſs of memory in ſome perſons.</p>
                     <p>The taſte was either exceedingly impaired, or very fickle. The ſame may be ſaid of the appetite. When the appetite began to return, and food to be reliſhed,
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0129_0feb12f701d60050"/>
the ſick were very voracious, but not eaſily ſuited. They diſcovered no partiality for animal food. Thirſt was moderate, in a few inſtances; but oftener exceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive. I have ſeen Porter deſired; but it was not often reliſhed, when allowed. The ſame is true of coffee. Water was, univerſally, the moſt agreeable drink; and I allowed its free uſe. One of my patients fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently drank, in one night, when very feveriſh and reſtleſs, three quarts of water. The appearance of the <hi>tongue</hi> varied, according to the violence and du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the diſeaſe, from white, to yellow, darkiſh, and black, like burnt blood; and the gums often aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed this laſt appearance, when there had been bleeding from them.</p>
                     <p>An aſtoniſhing inſenſibility to cold was nearly univerſal.—I remember, in one of thoſe cold turns which we had in September, a remark<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                        </gap>le inſtance of this. One of my patients occupied a chamber in the ſecond ſtory: the room was very large, extending the whole width of the houſe, and having a chimney, a large door, and two windows at either end. The bed was hard, in the middle of the room, the door and all the windows open, and he covered with a ſingle ſheet, frequently thrown off in his reſtleſſneſs, yet he complained of no cold, while I was chilled through, though ſheltered from the draught of air, with my uſual cloaths on, and the addition of a ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tout and double cloak.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. Yellowneſs of the ſkin was not conſtantly preſent in this diſeaſe; at leaſt, not in any remarkable degree. A tinge of it was common in the eyes and on the ſkin; but not ſtronger, in numerous inſtances, than in ordinary Fevers. Some were exceedingly yellow, even to being tawny—ſo that the bed and body linen were ſtained, both by the ſweat and urine.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="unknown:031169_0130_0feb12faf0f251b8"/>I ſaw eruptions but in a ſingle inſtance. They re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembled muſketo bites ſo nearly, that, had I not been forewarned of this ſimilarity by Dr. Ruſh, in his ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of the Philadelphia Fever, I ſhould have miſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken them, eſpecially conſidering the numbers of theſe <hi>animals.</hi>—In this inſtance, the eruptions were on every part of the body; which had not been expoſed to <hi>their</hi> ravages.</p>
                     <p>I have ſometimes obſerved a coldneſs of the ſkin, on the body, generally, but eſpecially of the feet, of which the patient was unconſcious, while the face and breaſt were red and communicated a burning ſenſation to the touch.</p>
                     <p n="9">IX. I have, hitherto, ſaid nothing of the <hi>type</hi> of the Fever of 1795; and, in truth, it is a point on which I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

the violent ſymptoms; while, on the other hand, the ſick never failed to get through the day with more eaſe to themſelves, when no ſuch exceſs, or irregula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, happened.</p>
                     <p>In one caſe which came under my care, and which various cauſes contributed to render the moſt inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſting of any I attended, there were complete inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions, during a part of the diſorder; but there was no kind of regularity, either in their commencement, or duration; and a ſlight exceſs, in any of the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars mentioned in the preceeding paragraph, was ſufficient to bring on a ſpeedy and violent turn of Fever.</p>
                     <p n="10">X. The period of convaleſcence, as well as of Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, was variable. In the former part of the time, and before the weather began to grow cool, patients ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom died after the tenth day—as far as I can learn; but their deaths took place on the 3d, 4th, 5th, 6th, 7th, rarely on the 8th, and ſtill more rarely on the 9th day. After the cold weather appeared, they ſometimes dropped off ſuddenly, and after having ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibited all the marks of convaleſcence, three weeks from the time of their ſeizure.—So, of thoſe who re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covered, ſome regained their health with an elaſtic quickneſs; while others, were very ſlow in the ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſition of ſtrength; were a long time troubled with great weakneſs in ſome of their joints, and ofteneſt the knees; and were afflicted by oedematous ſwellings of the feet, ancles, and legs.</p>
                     <p>You have now before you the reſult of my obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations, on the appearances of the Fever of 1795; and I ſhall conclude this letter by the ſimple men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion

of two facts, which will ſerve to confirm the doctrine of the great Sydenham, concerning the deſpotic nature of the reigning ſickneſs.</p>
                     <p>The Meazles had begun to appear, when the Fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer came, and they diſappeared; but no ſooner was the Fever vanquiſhed, than they returned more generally than ever, and have continued in this city ever ſince.<note n="*" place="bottom">April.</note>

                     <p>I cannot learn that any febrile diſeaſe was obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the city, while the Yellow-Fever was preſent. I ſaw only one inſtance of Intermitting-Fever in a lady, who contracted it in the country. It was ſlight, and was ſoon cured on her coming to town, by the uſual remedies. Her reſidence in town, like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe, was in a part to which the Yellow Fever never came. Beſide this, I heard of one other inſtance, of a gentleman coming hither, from ſome other place, with the Fever and Ague; which was, alſo, cured by the uſual means.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall proceed, in my next letter, to bring you ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quainted with thoſe means which were moſt ſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in the removal of that diſeaſe which I have juſt deſcribed.</p>

                     <p>IT was obvious, to the ſlighteſt obſervation, that the mildneſs, or ſeverity, of the Fever of 1795, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended, in no ſmall degree, on the ſituation of the
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0133_0feb1303b4b64728"/>
patient. That thoſe who lived in the higher, drier, cleaner, and more airy parts of the town, were more lightly affected; and that a removal, from the other quarters, into ſuch as were ſo circumſtanced, was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways followed by beneficial effects to the perſon re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved. In conſequence, a milder treatment, in every reſpect, eſpecially a more ſparing uſe of evacuations, was warrantable in ſome caſes, than in others; and as ſome practitioners were chiefly employed among thoſe whoſe favorable ſituations protected them from the moſt malignant attacks of the diſeaſe, you will readily conceive why there ſhould prevail, in the minds of ſome, an opinion that very active remedies were unneceſſary, and a recurrence to the lancet in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expedient, at leaſt, if not pernicious. It is true that I did not always uſe it myſelf; but it is alſo true, that I never failed to regret the omiſſion. And though I loſt no patient by the neglect, yet I am convinced that, in every ſuch caſe, however ſlight the diſeaſe might appear, the cure was protracted. But, if the remedies were not always the ſame, the principle on which they were adminiſtered, was uniform; and their operation the ſame in kind, if not in degree.— And, after the Fever became more general, and the ſeaſon conſiderably advanced, there was but little choice left in the uſe of means. Poſitive and ſpeedy relief was required; for to temporize, was to kill.— You will ſufficiently comprehend, from theſe re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks, how far the practice recommended below admitted of variety in the application; and I ſhall de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain you no longer from the conſideration of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular remedies, which are meant to be arranged nearly in the order of their comparative importance.</p>
                     <p n="1">I. BLOOD-LETTING.—This was indicated by the ſevere pain, heat, and redneſs, of the head and countenance; by the redneſs, turgeſcence,
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0134_0feb13055c748fa8"/>
and heavineſs, of the eyes; by the oppreſſion, pain, and anxiety, often obſervable at the breaſt; by the fullneſs, hardneſs, tenſity, or oppreſſedneſs of the pulſe—and equally by that ſlender, wiry, vermicular feeling which it ſometimes had—commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicating an idea of approaching numbneſs to the finger which felt it.<note n="*" place="bottom">It is ſcarcely poſſible to convey an idea, by words, of minute peculiarities in the pulſe. You will recollect this, and pardon me, if I have failed in this inſtance.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The effects of bleeding were, in every inſtance where I had an opportunity of obſerving them, moſt ſalutary. The ſick ſeldom failed of finding immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate relief from it, and of perceiving that relief in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed as the blood continued to flow. It diminiſhed the pains in the head, breaſt, and ſtomach: oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, anxiety, faintneſs, and heat, were moderated: the eyes rarely failed to aſſume a clearer and more natural appearance: and it ſeemed to communicate a new energy to the ſyſtem.—I remember an inſtance where a patient was ſo unable to aſſiſt himſelf, on the ſecond day of the diſeaſe, that, when I wanted to bleed him, it required two perſons to ſupport him, in paſſing a few ſteps from his bed, into the open air.— There, he was ſeated and ſupported in a chair. He grew eaſier, in every reſpect, as the blood flowed.— After taking away about twenty ounces, and tying up his arm, he roſe without aſſiſtance; walked ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rods, to a Neceſſary; took care of himſelf; had a profuſe evacuation, by which he ſeemed to gain addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional ſtrength; and returned to his bed, without any aid, and with a firm ſtep.</p>
                     <p>Such were the immediate effects of bleeding early in the diſeaſe. The importance of this remedy was not diminiſhed by the duration of the diſorder, nor
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0135_0feb13084f950768"/>
the neceſſity for it leſſened, while the ſymptoms con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued which made it uſeful in the commencement.— On the contrary, it was oftentimes as requiſite, and as beneficial, the fifth and the ſixth days, as on the firſt. But this neceſſity for its uſe, at ſo late a period, did not often occur, where it had been vigorouſly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed, in connection with other remedies, at the firſt.</p>
                     <p>The following caſe, which I ſtate briefly, is one among numbers, in evidence of the advantage of early, free, and repeated bleeding.</p>
                     <p>A phyſician was called to a young man, with all the ſymptoms of the diſeaſe—as it generally appeared at the firſt—in the evening. He bled him 16 or 18 ounces; directed purges, &amp;c. in the manner hereaf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter to be mentioned; and though the weather was then cool, ordered the windows to be removed, both day and night. The ſymptoms were relieved; but the next morning it was thought neceſſary to repeat the bleeding; which was done, to an equal quantity. The purges, &amp;c. were alſo continued. In the even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a third bleeding was performed, and a like quan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tity of blood was taken away; and the other reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies were continued. On the ninth day, from the ſeizure, the man was well, and able to purſue his bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs; though his ſtrength was not perfectly reſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tored.</p>
                     <p>In one inſtance which came to my knowledge, bleeding removed an obſtinate vomiting, of many days continuance, which threatened the life of the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient, and which had reſiſted all other remedies.</p>
                     <p>It ſeems hardly neceſſary to add any thing more, in favor of this remedy, after its beneficial effects have
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0136_0feb130b66161f40"/>
been ſtated, with ſo much eloquence and perſpicuity, by Dr. Ruſh, in his various publications, reſpecting the Yellow Fever.</p>
                     <p n="2">II. PURGING. No caſe occurred, in my particular practice, where, notwithſtanding the vomiting, ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thartics could not be adminiſtered. When this ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tom was very troubleſome, they were required to be given in a ſolid form, at more considerable intervals, and of as ſmall a ſize as poſſible. The activity of the purge was always to be proportioned to the vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence of the ſymptoms; and it was important that all medicines of this kind ſhould be given in divided doſes—ſo as to promote a gradual and continued diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge.—The operation was often very much aſſiſted by clyſters; for which water alone was neceſſary.</p>
                     <p>The good effects of cathartics were not leſs obvi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous than thoſe of venaeſection. They were indicated by the conſtipation, ſo generally preſent; by pain in the bowels, flatulency, and tumefaction of the abdo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; by pains of the head, heat and fluſhings of the face, and of the whole body; and finally, by the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitings: and all theſe ſymptoms they rarely failed to obviate, or relieve. This relief, too, was oftentimes ſo ſudden, as to ſeem like enchantment.—Frequently have I ſeen a patient, after an hour or more of ſevere pain, reſtleſſneſs, heat, thirſt, and inquietude of every kind—feeble, exhauſted, and as it were, ready to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire—riſe with the greateſt difficulty, and with the aid of others, to the chair, and after his evacuation, feel his pains removed, his heat and reſtleſſneſs va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed, his ſtrength renewed, and himſelf able to fit up, or walk about, and breathe the air with freedom: and ſometimes, the diſcharge was followed by a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing ſleep, and gentle perſpiration.</p>
                     <p>
                        <pb facs="unknown:031169_0137_0feb130f590e17d0"/>Theſe benefits were neither ſo certainly, nor ſo fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, obtained, where the evacuations were violent and ſudden. Indeed, it appears queſtionable to me, whether it be ever proper to excite ſuch discharges, in Fevers. Patients, when much reduced, are apt to ſink under ſuch immediate and abundant evacua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
                     <p n="3">III. COOL AIR.—It was of the utmoſt importance to procure a conſtant application of cool air to the body of the patient, from the commencement of the Fever. The advantages which reſulted, were univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal and wonderful.—To this end, the ſick were or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to be placed on a hard bed, with very little covering, in the middle of the room; and the doors and windows were, as much as poſſible, kept open day and night.—The good effects of this practice were exceedingly increaſed, where the application of the cool air could be made to the patient in an erect poſture. For, not only was it more equable, but the head was alſo relieved, thereby, from that ſenſe of fullneſs and oppreſſion which was invariably experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced in a recumbent poſture. The ſick, therefore, were directed to ſit up, in the courſe of the day, with the aſſiſtance of their attendants, as long as their ſtrength would permit, without their becoming ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted. While in this ſituation, their feet and legs were covered more warmly than any other part of the body: and if cloths, dipped in cold water, or vinegar, were often applied to the temples, the relief obtained was ſtill greater.</p>
                     <p n="4">IV. COOL DRINKS.—The great thirſt, which was nearly univerſal in this Fever, from the firſt, made the drinks, of neceſſity, an article of early attention. It was obſervable that they never could be <hi>too cold.</hi> Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tients
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:031169_0138_0feb1310fb39d5b0"/>
complained of the warmth of water which had been ſtanding but a ſhort time; and ſeemed to languiſh for a ſupply of freſh water, with an anxiety which became truly painful, when the uſual hour of its diſtribution approached.<note n="*" place="bottom">The water which is uſed for drinking, in this city, is moſtly drawn from a ſingle pump, called the Tea-Water Pump; and it is diſtributed, by means of large caſks, which are carted to every part of the town; once a day, in winter; and every morning and afternoon, in ſummer.</note>
                     </p>
                     <p>The good effects of a plentiful uſe of cool, dilut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drinks, were obvious. They tempered the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternatural heat and anxiety of the ſtomach; often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained vomiting, and the faucial hemorrhage; ſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to dilute, and carry off, the offenſive contents of the inteſtines; and diſpoſed to a more equable and aqueous ſweat.—Of all other drinks, Water was moſt reliſhed—and on many accounts, was the moſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per. A pleaſant and ſuitable drink was made, by pouring warm water on freſh apples, and ſuffering it to cool; and likewiſe, by the addition of a piece of toaſted bread to water. Milk, much diluted with water, was reliſhed by ſome; ſome were fond of but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter-milk; and as all theſe poſſeſſed bland and nutriti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, qualities, they were advantageouſly uſed, where a variety of drinks was required by the capricious taſte of the patient.</p>
                     <p>I had no opportunity of trying the effiacy of ICE, but the teſtimony of a Phyſician, in whole judgement and veracity I place great confidence, is ſtrongly in its favor, and inclines me to believe that it may be uſed with high expectations of advantage. Under his direction, it anſwered, better than any thing elſe, in relieving heat and fever; reſtraining hemorrhagy;
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:031169_0139_0feb13141d9c69f0"/>
and obviating, partially, or entirely, the vomiting— even the <hi>black vomiting.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p n="5">V. CLEANLINESS.—This is of the utmoſt impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and, in a meaſure, indiſpenſable.—The bed and body linen ſhould be often changed; the cloaths neceſſary about the bed, well aired, ſeveral times a day: there ſhould be two beds, one of which may be aired, while the other is in uſe: all unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary furniture—particularly woollen, ſilk and cot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton—every thing which may abſorb and retain efflu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>via and moiſture—ſhould be removed: all utenſils employed about the patient, frequently changed and rinſed: the room ſhould be often ſprinkled and duſted: the face, mouth, eyes whole head, hands— and, where it can be done, body of the patient, waſhed with <hi>cool</hi> water, ſeveral times in the day. The more exactly—other circumſtances being regarded—theſe directions can be put in execution, the better for the patient; and, as my own experience convinces me, the more certain and ſpeedy will be his recovery.— You will obſerve that I ſay cool water; for I cannot believe that the ſhock which would follow from the application of cold water to the body, would be be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neficial.—It is not here, as in the uſe of air; for water is ſo much more perfect a conductor of heat, that the abſtraction would be univerſal and ſudden, were it applied cold. And, beſide, as much is effected per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, by the ablution, as by the coldneſs, conſequent upon bathing.</p>
                     <p>It was not in my power, in any caſe, to carry this practice to the extent I wiſhed; but, <hi>caeteris paribus,</hi> the relief of the patient was proportioned to the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree in which it was purſued.</p>
                     <p n="6">
                        <pb n="136" facs="unknown:031169_0140_0feb1317028979a0"/>VI. BLISTERS.—The advantages uſually derived from the uſe of bliſters, were not evident. It was ſometimes doubtful whether they were any way ſerviceable. Yet there were inſtances in which they afforded relief; though moſtly temporarily.— I have ſeen them, applied to the breaſt, relieve the oppreſſion at the lungs; and applied to the back of the neck, relieve the head: in both caſes, when the diſeaſe had been of ſome days continuance. A phyſician, to whom I mentioned theſe remarks, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed me that his experience juſtified them, except when, as was often obſerved by him, a hemorrhage enſued from the veſication, and continued for ſome days. Perhaps it was neceſſary to the efficacy of bliſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, that they ſhould have been, always, preceded by copious blood-letting.</p>
                     <p n="7">VII. The <hi>Tinctura Sacra,</hi> given in ſmall quantities, at intervals, in water, was found by one Phyſician, to have the happieſt effects, in relieving nauſea, and obviating the tendency to vomit, in all caſes where a deſtruction of the coats of the ſtomach had not taken place. The ſame gentleman derived much advantage over the diſeaſe, where, from long-continued vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miting and effort to vomit, the ſtomach appeared to have ſuſtained conſiderable injury, or abraſion, from the uſe of <hi>Ol. Oliv. vel amygdal. dulc.</hi>—The oil co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered the inflamed, or abraded, part, and protected it from mechanical ſtimulus, while it allayed the ſoreneſs and irritation produced by the action of the diſeaſed fluids it contained.</p>
                     <p n="8">VIII. FOOD.—I have before remarked that the ſick ſhewed no preference for animal food; on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, they very generally refuſed it. Some, who requeſted it to be prepared for them, found themſelves
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0141_0feb1319df84a638"/>
unable to eat it, when preſented to them.—Fruits, milk, biſcuit boiled in milk or water, ſago, ſalep, haſty-pudding, and vegetable food, generally, were moſt reliſhed by them, both during their illneſs and their convaleſcence.—This was peculiarly fortunate, as any indulgence in a contrary courſe, was ſure to be followed by diſtreſſing effects. The more rigidly attentive patients were to preſerving a ſimplicity of diet, the more certain and pleaſant was their recovery. And, in all caſes that I had opportunity to obſerve, their convaleſcence was always extended or ſhortened, tedious or ſatisfactory, in proportion as they returned ſuddenly to the uſe of meats and ſtimulating drinks, or adhered to vegetable food and water.</p>
                     <p>I have now, my dear friend, made you acquainted with that courſe which I generally purſued, in regard to thoſe who came under my care. The number was not great, nor the ſucceſs always complete—for I had not always the liberty of employing the means I wiſhed to, as fully and freely as was neceſſary to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete ſucceſs. But, I can truly ſay, that I never ſaw them do injury; and that they appeared to me to do good, in every caſe, where they were employed, and in the proportion of their trial and application.— More than this no man can truly declare; more than this ought never to be expected from any remedies. The moſt able practitioners are deſtined to ſee their patients frequently expire, in ſpite of all their care, through the obſtinacy of the patients themſelves, and the prejudices of their friends, the careleſſneſs of at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, or the intervention of unforeſeen and una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidable accidents. The conſcioſuneſs of having done their duty, of having acquitted themſelves, under cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0142_0feb131dd71560c8"/>
ſo diſtreſsful and embaraſſing, to the beſt of their knowledge, and with purity of intention, will prove a never-failing conſolation, though the execra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of ignorance, and the calumnies of hatred, may purſue and perſecute them.—Happy,—at leaſt in this reſpect,—are thoſe, <hi>"the peaceful tenor of whoſe way,"</hi> while it excites neither oppoſition nor malice, and neither elevates to opulence nor fame, ſecures them from miſrepreſentation and injuſtice.</p>

                        <hi>LETTER TENTH.</hi> Miſcellaneous remarks on Medicines uſed as Remedies in the Fever, and general concluſions.</head>
                     <p>YOU wiſh to obtain every poſſible information, reſpecting the Fever of 1795; you are not ſatisfied with knowing what remedies I employed, nor which were moſt ſucceſsful; but you would learn all that were uſed; the ſucceſs, or failure of each. I ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaud your curioſity, my friend, for I am not ignorant of the benevolent motives which excite it; but I fear that there is little with which it is in my power fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to gratify it. The practice which I ſaw, was that which I have recommended: other remedies I know were uſed; but, not having had opportunity, but in few inſtances, to mark their effects, I ought not, from my own convictions, how well-founded ſoever they may appear to me, precipitately to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn either the preſcriptions, or their authors. In the variety of caſes, conſtitutions, and circumſtances, it might happen that ſome of thoſe very things, which
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0143_0feb131f9018ed08"/>
appeared pernicious when I ſaw them uſed, were ſometimes proper and ſalutary. It would be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumptuous, therefore, in me, to decide without more information; but I may be allowed an opinion; and that opinion need not be with-held from a friend.—I confeſs, then, that from the ſucceſs which attended the antiphlogiſtic plan of cure, I am perſuaded that no other can be ſalutary, or ſafe; and the few in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances in which the effects of a different mode of treating the Fever were obſerved by me, ſtrengthened my previous convictions of its inutility and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger.</p>
                     <p>The medicines chiefly truſted to, by thoſe who purſued a different courſe from that laid down in the preceding letter, were, as I am informed, Calomel, to promote, or effect a Salivation,—Bark—Lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num—Wine, and other ſtimulating drinks—with an Animal diet.</p>
                     <p>Of the effects of Salivation, not having ſeen it take place, by nature nor art, in the Fever of 1795, I can ſay nothing. Dr. Ruſh countenances the practice, in his Treatiſe on the Fever of Philadelphia, and adds the teſtimony of many reſpectable authorities to his own.—As a Cathartic, Calomel, combined with other purgative ſubſtances, was unqueſtionably uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful. Some, I know, thought otherwiſe; and that other purgatives might be more ſafely and efficaciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly employed; and, I confeſs, I ſaw ſome caſes in which it appeared to affect the ſtomach very painful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. But a Phyſician on whoſe judgment I have great reliance, informs me, that he ſaw reaſon to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject a ſimilar opinion, which he had haſtily adopted; repeated obſervation having convinced him, that all the ſymptoms of gaſtric affection were worſe in thoſe
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0144_0feb1322a8725308"/>
who had not been purged with Calomel, than in thoſe who had been evacuated by its aſſiſtance.</p>
                     <p>I gave Bark, in no form, but in three caſes. Two were in the early part of the reign of the Fever, the two firſt patients that I had; and I am convinced it retarded the cure in both. In the other inſtance, it was adminiſtered after the Fever had left the Patient, and he was convaleſcent. Here it was given as any other Bitter, and as much in compliance with his opinions, as from any expectation of its doing good; and, as far as I can judge, with very little effect of any kind.—In the following caſe, its exhibition was not ſo harmleſs.</p>
                     <p>A medical friend was called to viſit the patient of another Phyſician, who had quitted town, on account of his health. The ſick man was oppreſt by the moſt alarming ſymptoms; of the number of which, were hemorrhagy and the black vomit. The ſtimu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating ſyſtem had been ſteadily purſued, and was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued, under the direction of a pupil of the phyſician firſt employed. In particular, large quantities of Bark were exhibited, throughout the day.—On the entrance of the ſecond phyſician, the Bark and all other medicines of the kind, were laid aſide; cool air was freely admitted; and the antiphlogiſtic plan of cure ſtrictly adhered to. The conſequence was, that all the ſymptoms were relieved, and a proſpect opened on the patient of a recovery. The vomiting and hemorrhagy had totally ceaſed. In this ſitua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and while the Phyſician was attending to ſome perſons whoſe condition was more alarming, the perſon who had the immediate charge of the ſick man, began, again, to adminiſter the Bark.—The next day —or the very ſame, at night—all the bad ſymptoms
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0145_0feb13269d982c00"/>
recurred; the Bark was, nevertheleſs, perſiſted in; and the man died.</p>
                     <p>Several ſimilar caſes have been reported to me; but none ſo minutely as to authorize an attempt to ſtate them to you.</p>
                     <p>The extreme reſtleſſneſs of a patient, in whom I had the ſtrongeſt intereſt, and for whoſe fate the deepeſt anxiety, induced me, in violation of my more ſober judgement, to adminiſter Laudanum.— This I did not do, till he had ſpent three nearly ſleep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs nights.—In every inſtance, it undoubtedly, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſed the reſtleſſneſs, clammy ſweats, thirſt and Fever. I was obliged to diſcontinue it.</p>
                     <p>Wine, brandy and water, and eſpecially porter, when taken by any of my patients, had the moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicious effects. I had occaſion to ſee an acceſs of Fever, repeatedly brought on by the one, and a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lapſe by the other; where they were uſed without my knowlege, and contrary to my direction.</p>
                     <p>Of the effects of Animal Diet, I have already ſpoken, and have nothing new to add.</p>
                     <p>On the whole, it appears inconteſtible to me, that what is called the antiphlogiſtic treatment is to be adopted in Fevers like that which prevailed in New-York, in 1795, in all its ſtrictneſs, and adhered to with pertinacious reſolution. Both the ſymptoms of the diſeaſe, and the ſucceſs attendant on the practice recommended, concur in eſtabliſhing the propriety of employing it.—It is alſo to be remembered that, in this diſeaſe, not a moment is to be loſt: a day, an hour, nay almoſt an inſtant of delay, may ſometimes be fatal; and the means practiſed muſt be powerful in proportion to the violence of the ſymptoms. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0146_0feb132844222aa0"/>
muſt we be deceived by the apparent mildneſs of the ſeizure—for a few hours may entirely change the face of things, and we may be left to lament that credulity which led us to temporize, and prevented the uſe of thoſe remedies, which delay alone rendered ineffectual.</p>
                     <p>But, while the Phyſician ſtrenuouſly directs his ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts to the removal of the ſymptoms of this diſeaſe, let him not overlook a paſſion which never fails to aggravate them. <hi>Fear,</hi> the exciting cauſe, in many in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances, of the Fever; the fomenter of all its evils; and ſometimes, as it were, the ſole diſeaſe; is a fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and dreadful calamity, and one of the direſt adverſaries with which medicine has to contend.—In numerous inſtances, during the continuance of the Fever of 1795, apprehenſion touched upon inſanity; deſtroying all confidence in the Phyſician and in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medies, or exciting an abſurd and enthuſiaſtic reliance on pretenders and madmen: and utterly diſqualfying the patient for a proper attention to himſelf.—In the well, the evil was ſcarcely leſs. The name, alone, of Yellow Fever, ſeemed ſufficient to induce diſeaſe, to baniſh diſcretion, to ſever the bonds of ſocial connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, rend aſunder the ties of parental, filial, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nubial affection, and put reaſon to flight.—It was in vain to point out the folly of this terror; to declare the diſeaſe not infectious, and eaſy of prevention; to offer mathematical demonſtration that other diſorders were often more mortal, without exciting any alarm; it was ſtill the Yellow Fever, and that was an irreſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtable reply to every argument.—The city of New-Haven, ſummer before laſt, loſt about 50 of its inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants, with the Yellow Fever. Univerſal conſter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation prevailed throughout the place; all buſineſs was at an end; and moſt of the principal inhabitants fled.—Laſt ſummer, the Dyſentery raged there: more
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0147_0feb132b10408d90"/>
than 70 perſons died of it: but nobody fled; nobody was frightened; and the Magiſtrates, very gravely, put a ſtop to all communication with New-York, for fear of the Yellow Fever; made veſſels ride qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rantine, and confined ſtage-coach paſſengers, that no contagion might be diffuſed, through the city, from their trunks and their garments.—But, it is time to put an end to this ſeries of letters; and ſeek, by no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velty, to give new intereſt to our correſpondence. I ſhall take my leave of the preſent ſubject, with an enumeration of the inferences I have drawn from having viewed it, in the light here exhibited to you.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The Fever of 1795 was Endemic:—i. e. gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated by local cauſes, producing a Fever every year, in this city.</p>
                     <p n="2">2. The peculiar ferocity of the Endemic of New-York, in 1795, is aſcribable to the peculiarity of the ſeaſon, together with a greater accumulation, than uſual, of the ordinary cauſes.</p>
                     <p n="3">3. It was not Contagious: i. e. communicated by contact of diſeaſed perſons, by cloaths, nor by viſiting the ſick, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p n="4">4. As it originated here, its prevention will depend on a change of the local and individual circumſtances which promote it.</p>
                     <p n="5">5. The Fever in 1795, exhibited ſuch appearances as characterize what are cuſtomarily denominated In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p n="6">6. It is cured by the remedies ſuited to remove In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flammatory Diſeaſes.</p>
                     <p n="7">
                        <pb facs="unknown:031169_0148_0feb132ddd3beeb8"/>7. The ſame cauſes which converted the ordinary Fever of New-York into the Yellow Fever, would change the Fever which prevails around our Weſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern Lakes into the Yellow Fever; and, as certainly, the Intermitting Fever of Sheffield: while the eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhment of a free ventilation, the filling up of all pools, yards, &amp;c. and a ſcrupulous attention to clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and ſimple diet, would reduce our Fever to a ſimple Remittent or Intermittent, or remove it alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether; as the filling up and cultivation of your ponds and marſhes, would forever baniſh all Fevers of the kind—as general diſeaſes—from Sheffield.</p>
                     <p>I have now, my dear friend, performed the taſk demanded of me, in the beſt manner I am able con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with my leiſure, and my duty towards others. I cannot conclude without once more ſoliciting your indulgence, and requeſting you to recollect with what expectations and confeſſions I entered on the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of theſe letters.—I have taken the words of Cicero for my motto—
<q>Rationem, quò ea me cumque ducet ſequar—</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>And if I have erred in my conceptions of what <hi>is</hi> reaſon, and what <hi>was</hi> fact, let my intentions prove my apology.</p>

                  <p>IF, in our attempts to add to your information reſpecting the fever, which prevailed here in Auguſt laſt, we ſhould draw upon us the illiberal ſarcaſms, which we have obſerved to attend all who endeavor to ſerve their fellow creatures in this way, we muſt leave it to you to juſtify our intentions, at leaſt, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ourſelves unprepared to anſwer any thing which may be objected to what we ſhall advance. We mean to ſtate facts, or what we believe to be ſuch, and willing to admit that there are ſeveral ways of curing the ſame diſeaſe. It will not be underſtood, that we reprobate the practice of others who follow a different mode of treatment. Our obſervations have been drawn from thirty years experience, with the advantage of records relating to ſimilar diſeaſes for a much longer period. We do not know of a more regular mode of treating the ſubject than by anſwering your inquiries in the order they occur, which will perhaps comprehend every thing required at preſent.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="unknown:031169_0151_0feb13366c1c7330"/>The Fever we believe has its origin in the ſeaſon, and exiſts every year in various grades, beginning generally in the month of Auguſt, and disappearing about the middle of October.</p>
                  <p>The preciſe time of its commencement and termi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation, and its degree of malignancy, depending upon contingent cauſes. We have been accuſtomed to call it a Bilious Remittent, with a tendency to putrefac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whenever it proves uncommonly fatal, it is aggravated, according to the beſt of our obſervation, by the prevalence of ſome unuſual weather for a long time together—Thus we have ſeen this diſeaſe equally malignant after a dry hot ſeaſon, and after a very rainy period. The approach of froſty weather being uniformly the cure for the effects of either.— The Fever of the laſt autumnal ſeaſon, appeared firſt on the river, then on the ſtreets adjoining; was ſoon after diffuſed through the town and ſuburbs, and finally the neighboring country; though in this laſt not generally: as uſual it declined on the approach of cold weather.—The month of June had been very cool, and at the change of the moon, or a little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, it began to rain in torrents, and ſo continued to do, with ſhort intervals of cloſe ſultry weather, till Auguſt, when a violent hurricane, attended with a flood of rain, laid waſte the whole vegetable king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom—afterwards the weather was as before, ſultry and moiſt, with profuſe ſhowers till the end of Sep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tember.—The firſt appearance of the Fever was about the 10th of Auguſt; it increaſed in violence and in extenſion during all that month; it was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived then to abate, and continued to do ſo till the laſt day of September, when a few froſty nights ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pervening, it diſappeared almoſt ſuddenly and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb facs="unknown:031169_0152_0feb13398b5876f8"/>There were perhaps more deaths, than for many years before; but whether greater in number to the proportion of the ſick, than is uſual from autumnal diſeaſes, which prove as univerſal as that in queſtion, we cannot undertake to determine. The ſame mode of treatment generally ſucceeded—as in other ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. Our method was plentiful depletion in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, not by bleeding, but by purging with Jalap, Calomel, Scammony, Aloes, or by the milder purges, the Neutral Salts—Sennae, Rhubarb, Manna, &amp;c. as the age, ſex and conſtitution of the patient pointed out,—taking care that the evacuation of the firſt paſſages was complete, by whatever means procured. As ſoon as we judged that to be ſufficient—which we always endeavored to make ſo with as little delay as poſſible—the bark was adminiſtered in all and every form that it could be made to remain, without re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to quantity, or to the period, or height of the fever, with wine, porter, and even brandy, if wine was rejected by the inclination, habit, or ſtomach of the patient. We can aſſure you, we have no reaſon to alter our mode of practice in future. In a multitude of inſtances, ſome will occur in all diſeaſes, when a change, and ſometimes a material change of reme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies may be neceſſary—ſuch caſes we found, and in thoſe we uſed Bliſters, Emetics, Camphor, Opium, and often ventured upon Cupping—but never upon venaeſection.—This laſt, a long courſe of practice has taught us to be at leaſt, not advantageous. In diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent climates, and under other circumſtances—when the diſeaſe may have appeared in other grades than thoſe we have experienced—that operation is perhaps found uſeful. We wiſh not to impoſe our opinion, as a rule for any perſon; ſenſible of the fallability of all human judgment. We ever thought it our duty to give up our own theories, when contradicted by events. We only mean to recommend that plan,
<pb facs="unknown:031169_0153_0feb133d85517340"
                         rendition="simple:additions"/>
which long experience has taught us to be moſt ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſsful. There is no proof that this diſeaſe poſſeſſed any ſpecific infection. It was rarely fatal to the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive inhabitants or the old ſettlers, ſpeaking of the town only; but we have been told that many of the traders from the Rivers and diſtant part of the State, died immediately after leaving the port. The terror which pervaded all parts of the country, and deprived thoſe victims of the common attentions of humanity, will eaſily account for this without applying to the malignancy of the diſeaſe. All, or moſt of thoſe born in, or who had been accuſtomed to a ſouthern cli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate, eſcaped death, and when attacked, had the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eaſe in its milder form.</p>
                  <p>A large number of the inhabitants enjoyed unin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terrupted health; moſt of the deaths happened in confined ſtreets and buildings, and in thoſe neareſt the river.—Thoſe who were accuſtomed to live well, (as it is termed) did not ſuffer ſo much as the poorer claſs—But the intemperate of every deſcription be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came victims when attacked—The ſmall pox imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately preceded this fever. We did not obſerve that thoſe who had been the ſubjects of it were par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſufferers.—There had been no malignant complaint in the preceding winter.</p>
                  <p>A particular deſcription of the fever, and its ſymp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toms, does not ſeem to be here neceſſary, becauſe, it differed from the ordinary Bilious Remittent, only in the rapidity with which it paſſed through the ſeveral ſtages, and in its malignancy.—This laſt circumſtance we are of opinion was occaſioned by the long conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued and univerſal heat and moiſture of the atmoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phere.—The air was evidently impregnated with pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trid effluvia, ariſing from decayed ſubſtances of every ſort, brought down upon the creeks and rivers by the</p>
