            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THE deſign of this work is to give amuſement to Children, by the ſame means that will moſt naturally lead them to Virtue, in conſtantly preſenting it to their eyes, in its moſt amiable form. In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of thoſe extravagant fictions, and romantic wonders, with which their imaginations have ſo long been led aſtray; they will here merely be offered ſuch adventures, as they may themſelves almoſt daily be ſpectators of in their own families. No attempt will be made to inſpire them with any ſentiments above their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception and capacity; and they will only be brought into action with one another, with their parents, with their play-fellows, the domeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics who ſurround them, and the animals to which they are moſt accuſtomed. They will expreſs themſelves in their own ſimple and unadorned language. Eagerly intereſted in all that happens, they will artleſsly give way to every riſing emotion of their early feel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings. They will then in their own faults find their puniſhment, in their own good actions their recompence. Every thing will concur to inſpire them with a love of goodneſs, as the means of happineſs, and an abhorrence of vice, as the ſource of mortification and miſery.</p>
            <p>It is hardly neceſſary to mention that this work is equally intended for children of both ſexes.<note n="(2)" place="bottom">A view of the firſt paſſions of the human heart, in the artleſs ſcenes of ingenuous infancy, is perhaps, of all repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, the moſt certain of attracting attention at every period of life. Young people, whoſe minds are not corrupted, will look back with the tendereſt recollection, to that ſweet early ſeaſon, of which, though their natural impetuoſity makes them haſten from it with little regret, they can never recall the ideas without delight, when it has been ſpent with its cuſtomary happineſs. Parents will behold with pleaſure a new ſource of inſtruction and entertainment for their children, from which they may themſelves ſometimes gather familiar and uſeful examples in what manner to reaſon with, and to treat them. The Aged, arrived at the oppoſite period of our mortal career, and peculiarly ſoothed by the ſociety of children, whether from the diſguſt they are too apt to find in all other, or from an inſtinctive ſelf-love, which urges them to ſeek out beings yet more feeble than themſelves, upon whom to exerciſe what is left them of authority, will be gratified by finding the means of attaching them, by ſuch dialogues and diſcourſes as will here be ſet before them. And even Men of the World, hackneyed as they are in common pictures of life, may yet be open to ſenſations of pleaſure in ſeeing a new portrait of manners, which, like thoſe of the paſtoral times, have the power of intereſting univerſally, by the charm: of Innocence and of Nature.</note> The difference of their characters
<pb n="iv" facs="unknown:026643_0003_0FD107694724E350"/>
and their purſuits, while both are yet ſo young, is not ſufficiently marked to require ſeparate leſſons. And the utmoſt attention has been paid to bringing them as often as poſſible together, with a view to contribute towards inſpiring that harmony and ſocial af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection, which it is ever moſt delightful to ſee between the children of the ſame parents.</p>
            <p>It has been endeavoured to give all poſſible variety to the ſeveral little Pieces which the volume contains. There is not one in the whole collection, which has not bad the trial of being read to ſome children of a more or leſs advanced age and underſtanding; and whatever was found deficient in engaging their attention, has either been altered or omitted.</p>
            <p>Several little dramatic pieces are interſperſed thro' the work, of which children may perform the principal characters, with a view to give them, early in life, courage, grace, and eaſe in their addreſs, deportment, and converſation. The repreſentation of theſe drama<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> may be made a domeſtic feſtival, while they contribute to their education. The parents, by performing a part in them, will enjoy the delightful ſatisfaction of participating in the gaiety of their young family; and it may be conſidered as a new band to unite them ſtill more tenderly to each other, from an interchange of gratitude and pleaſure.</p>
            <p>Independent, however, of the moral purpoſes, which it is hoped this work may anſwer to children; the original will be found no leſs uſeful in early teaching them to ſpeak the French language with facility; while to the youthful ſtudents of Engliſh in France, the tranſlation may prove of equal ſervice. Among the books which are generally given to them, the greater part are either above their comprehenſion, or written with but little knowledge of their ideas and characters. But here, every ſubject that is preſented to them, will be of a ſort to excite their curioſity, and intereſt their affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons; and cannot, therefore, fail to familiariſe them to the phraſes natural, in both languages, to their age, and to thoſe expreſſions which paint, with the greateſt ſimplicity, their deſires, their wants, and their pleaſures.</p>

            <head>PREFACE,</head>
            <byline>BY The TRANSLATOR.</byline>
            <p>THE work of Mr. Berquin, which is here preſented to the Engliſh reader, has been received in France with the flattering ſucceſs of univerſal approbation: and the edition which has been publiſhed in London, has already met with almoſt ſimilar encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement and honours. To transfuſe into the preſent verſion, either the ſpirit or the elegance of the original, is beyond the hopes of the Tranſlator; whoſe expectations will be anſwered, if it facilitates to our little ſtudents of the French language, the reading and underſtanding theſe admirable <hi>Leſſons of Amuſement</hi>; and whoſe utmoſt ambition, upon this ſubject, will be gratified, if it proves, at the ſame time, an aſſiſtance in the attainment of Engliſh, to the youthful pupils of our own tongue upon the continent.</p>
            <p>With this view, the greateſt attention has been paid to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the ſenſe of the author, without adhering to the idiom of his language. The diction, therefore, will always be Engliſh, though the converſation to which it is the vehicle may be foreign. Some trifling circumſtances, alſo, have been neceſſarily changed, where the manners of the two Nations were too oppoſite for a coalition.</p>
            <p>The exclamation of <hi>Mon Dieu,</hi> ſo common in France, to all ages, all occaſions, and all ranks of people, would, in England, be extremely offenſive in the mouths of children, except upon the moſt ſerious ſubjects, and when ſpoken with reverence and ſupplication.</p>
            <p>Nor was it poſſible to tranſlate literally the terms and actions of courteſy and good-breeding, among the children introduced in the dramas: for it appears, from the ſpecimens which Mr. Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quin has given, that the cuſtoms and opinions of our neighbours relating to juvenile politeneſs, vary not leſs from our own, than their ſentiments in religion and politics.</p>
            <p>All however, that belongs to ſtory, character, and ſentiment, has been faithfully preſerved. It were vain to make alterations, where there is no chance of improvement: and great, indeed, muſt be the ſkill that could add, in this little volume, to the intereſt excited by the ſtory, the example impreſſed by the cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, or the moral enforced by the ſentiment.</p>
            <p>It will, however, perhaps, be neceſſary to ſay <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>ething con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the little dramas which are interſperſed through the work, leſt their deſign ſhould be cenſured, from being ill underſtood.</p>
            <p>That they may be ſtudied, and even acted, with innocence, and improvement, in private houſes, is the ſole view of their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſertion: but a public exhibition of them is by no means recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended;
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:026643_0005_0FD1077144CB4798"/>
and all applauſe, even at excellence, ought in prudence to be with-held. Emulation might elſe be degraded into env<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, and modeſt eaſe and courage might degenerate into boldneſs. It is the office of kindneſs to ſtill the paſſions, not to awaken or give birth to them: and this office would ill be performed by kindling, in the boſoms of children, the dangerous flame of ambition; which, though capable of being turned to many ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mirable purpoſes, incurs the danger, in the experiment, of leading to vanity and conceit. Piety and humility, forbearance and humanity, are the virtues here chiefly inculcated; for to thoſe they muſt hereafter owe all that will be found moſt laudable, amiable, and attractive, in their conduct, their diſpoſition, and their manners.</p>
            <p>Neither is there the moſt remote deſire to cultivate theatrical talents: theſe little dramas are merely meant as a private ſtudy of elocution, and an exerciſe for the memory; not as incitements to competition, nor promoters of vain-glory.</p>
            <p>The great buſineſs of education, is to open and employ the various faculties of the underſtanding: and where theſe views are fulfilled, the ſeveral inſtructors of youth may be ſeverally contented: Not ſo, however, their parents, their preſent friends, or their future connexions. Talents, ſcience, and learning, however<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> brilliant, important or profitable, muſt ſtill, to thoſe with whom we live and aſſociate, be ſecondary conſiderations. The comforts of life cannot ſpring from them, though they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitute its refinements: they will not make the character endear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, though they may render any commerce with it illuſtrious. Domeſtic happineſs has its baſis in the temper, and every ſocial virtue its origin in the heart. To form or to mend theſe, is the buſineſs, therefore, of the moraliſt: and this, in the earlieſt ſtages of reflexion and obſervation, is the leſſon and aim of every tale in this work.</p>
            <p>The firſt impreſſions that ſtrike deep in the human mind, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther frivolous or ſerious, are rarely ſubdued, and ſcarce ever perhaps totally eradicated. Whatever, therefore, has any chance of firſt catching their attention, ſhould long merit their remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance; and to make what is ſubſervient to their education, contribute to their amuſement, is cheating idleneſs of futility, and alluring labour from inſtruction.</p>

            <p>LITTLE Fanny Greenland roſe very early one morning, with a deſign of gathering ſome flowers, and making them up into a noſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gay for her mama. But, as ſhe was preparing to go down ſtairs, her father came into the room, and taking her in his arms, ſaid, with a ſmile: Kiſs me, my dear Fanny, and come with me directly: I have ſomething to ſhew you that I am ſure you will like.</p>

            <p>A little brother! O where is he? Pray let me ſee! Pray carry me to him!</p>
            <p>MR. Greenland then opened the door of her mama's chamber. At the bed-ſide there was a woman, whom Fanny had never before <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
               <p>O, very glad, mama. You are very good to give me ſuch a pretty little companion. What a droll little face he has! and he is as red!—juſt as if he had been running. Will you let him come and play with me, papa?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Greenland.</speaker>
               <p>He is not able, my love; he cannot ſtand upon his feet. Only look how weak they are!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
               <p>O goodneſs, what little tiny feet! I ſee he could not run long with me.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Greenland.</speaker>
               <p>You muſt have patience, Fanny. He muſt firſt learn to walk: and after that you may play what gambols you pleaſe to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the garden.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>

               <speaker>Fanny.</speaker>
               <p>O, that I will, my dear pretty little man! I will give you all my play-things. Hey, ſhall you like to have them? Anſwer me, I ſay! He ſeems as if he ſmiled. Call me Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny,—Fanny! Why, now, why won't you ſpeak?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Greenland.</speaker>
               <p>He will not ſpeak for two years, perhaps. But take care, leſt you diſturb your mama with your prattle.</p>

               <speaker>Fanny.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Greenland.</speaker>
               <p>No, my love. God has given me milk on purpoſe that I may feed him with it. He is very weak now, but in a few days you will ſee ſome difference; and, in a few weeks, he will roll about the ground like a little lamb.</p>

               <p>No ſuch thing. I had it papered at the time when you were as little as your brother.</p>

               <p>Little babies never ſee or take notice of any thing that paſſes. When your brother is as old as you, aſk him if he remembers your trying to teach him to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce your name to-day. You will find he knows nothing of it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Greenland.</speaker>
               <p>Without doubt. O if you knew all the trouble ſhe has had with you! You were ſo weak that you could take nothing; every moment we were afraid you would die. Ah, my poor little baby! your mama uſed to ſay, what muſt I do! if ſhe ſhould cry herſelf into fits! And great, indeed, was the difficulty ſhe found to keep any life in you.</p>

               <p>Yes, my love, it was your mama. And after ſhe had ſucceeded in making you take your food, you became fat and ſpright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For near two years, ſhe had every day, and every hour of the day, the ſame trouble. Sometimes, when ſhe ſlept from mere fatigue, you woke her with your cries. She would then inſtantly riſe, and haſten to your cradle. My dear little Fanny, ſhe would ſay, while ſhe kiſſed you a thoſand times, perhaps you are hungry? And then again ſhe would feed you.</p>

               <p>Your mama and I. We put a band of ſtuft velvet round your head, that you might not hurt yourſelf if you ſhould happen to fall; we held you by leading-ſtrings, to aſſiſt your firſt little ſteps. We took you every day to the green-plat in the garden, and then, ſitting oppoſite each other, at a little diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, we made you ſtand all alone between us, and then held out our arms, to invite you firſt to one, then to the other. The ſmalleſt falſe ſtep you took, made our blood run cold. But by continually repeating this exerciſe, we taught you at laſt to walk by yourſelf.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Greenland.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, we alſo taught you that. I took you upon my knees, and repeated to you the names of Papa, and Mama, till you were able to liſp them yourſelf; and every word that you now know, you were then taught by us in the ſame manner. You ought yourſelf to remember that it was us, alſo, who inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted you how to read.</p>

            <p>O THAT Winter would but laſt forever! cried little Frank, as he came home from ſliding upon the ice, after amuſing himſelf by making figures with the ſnow in the garden.</p>
            <p>MR. Goodman his father, hearing this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation, called to him, and ſaid: Frank, you will oblige me, by writing down that wiſh in my tablets. Frank inſtantly obeyed, though with a hand that was ſhaking with cold.</p>
            <p>THE winter, however, ſoon paſſed away, and the Spring ſucceeded it.</p>
            <p>FRANK walked out one morning with his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, along a bank that was bordered with hya<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinths, auriculas, and narciſſuſes, and was almoſt tranſported with delight, while he breathed their fragrance, and admired their freſhneſs and beauty.</p>
            <p>THESE, ſaid Mr. Goodman, are the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of ſpring. They are brilliant, but they are very ſhort-lived. O! anſwered Frank, that it was but always Spring!</p>
            <p>WILL you write this wiſh in my tablets? ſaid his father. Frank, jumping with high ſpirits and joy, readily complied.</p>
            <p>THE ſpring, nevertheleſs was ſoon replaced by the Summer.</p>
            <p>FRANK, one fine afternoon, went out with his father and mother, and ſome companions of his own age, to walk in a neighbouring village.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:026643_0014_0FD1078E5E8333F8"/>THEY obſerved, as they proceeded, the moſt beautiful variety of views and objects: now they admired the young green corn, waving lightly with the wind, like the ſea in its gentleſt motion; and now a meadow enameled with a thouſand flowers. Now they ſaw little lambs friſking and bounding on the hills; and now little chickens were playing gambols around the hen. They regaled themſelves with cherries, ſtrawberries, and other fruits of the ſeaſon; and they paſſed the whole day in ſporting in the fields.</p>
            <p>DO you not find, Frank, ſaid his father, when they were returning home, that ſummer hath its pleaſures?</p>
            <p>O yes, anſwered Frank, how I wiſh it was to laſt the whole year!</p>
            <p>THIS wiſh, alſo, at the deſire of his father, he wrote in his tablets.</p>
            <p>AT length came the Autumn.</p>
            <p>ALL the family now went to ſee and enjoy the harveſt. It was not quite ſo hot as in ſum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer; the air was ſoft, and the ſky was ſerene. The waggons were loading with rich ſheaves of golden corn, the orchards were blooming with ripe plums and crimſon mulberries, and the branches of the apple-trees were bending with their fruit.</p>
            <p>THIS was a day of feaſt and frolic to Frank, who loved nothing ſo much as green-gages, and rich plums, and who was allowed the full en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyment of gathering them himſelf.</p>
            <p>THIS fine ſeaſon, ſaid his father to him, will ſoon be over; the winter is advancing to us with great ſtrides, to take the place of the au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tumn.</p>

               <p>Yes, my dear, they are all good, and all fertile in riches, and in pleaſures. God underſtands much better than we, limited creatures that we are, how to direct and to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vern their retreat and their approach.</p>

            <p>AFTER many flattering, but deceitful promiſes, the ſpring at length returned. The ſoft-blowing wind again warmed the air, the ſnow was melted, the graſs recovered its beautiful green, the flowers put forth their ſweets, and the birds were every where heard ſinging.

<pb n="12" facs="unknown:026643_0017_0FD10798C90D13E0"/>
the firſt budding violets; when, ſuddenly and unexpectedly, the weather again changed. All at once, the wind roſe in the North with vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence, it blew furiouſly through the woods, and the ground was covered with ſnow. At night little Louiſa went ſhivering to bed, yet returning thanks in her prayers to God, that he had giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en her ſo ſafe a ſhelter from the injuries of the ſeaſon.</p>
            <p>THE next morning when ſhe got up, the flowers, the graſs, the hedges, were all one white. There had been, during the night, ſo great a fall of ſnow, that the paſſengers, who were obliged to walk in it, found it up to their knees.</p>
            <p>LOUISA was grieved at the ſight; but the little birds ſeemed much more ſo; for the ſnow lay ſo deep upon the ground, that they could find neither grain nor worm, to appeaſe their hunger.</p>
            <p>ALL the little feathered inhabitants of the woods, now flew to the towns and the villages, to ſeek for refuge and protection. Large flights of ſparrows, linnets, chaffinches and larks, came into the yards and gardens, perched upon the roofs of the houſes, and beat about, with their little bills and their feet, in every heap of rubbiſh they could find, in hopes of picking up ſomething for food.</p>
            <p>NEAR fifty of theſe little ramblers flew or dropt into the court-yard before Louiſa's houſe. Louiſa ſaw them, and, full of ſorrow, went into her papa's room. What is the matter, my love? cried he. O papa, ſhe anſwered, thoſe poor little birds, that ſung ſo prittily and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:026643_0018_0FD1079B8F3908A0"/>
ſo merrily only two days ago, are now all down there, in the court-yard. They are quite numb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with cold, and they have nothing to eat. May I go to the granary, papa, and take out ſome grain for them?</p>
            <p>WITH all my heart, anſwered her father. Louiſa waited for nothing more. The granary was at ſome diſtance from the houſe; but ſhe haſtened to it with all ſpeed, followed by her governeſs, and eagerly filled her hands with corn and hemp-ſeed, which ſhe ran and threw all over the court-yard. The birds now flew about her in great numbers, eagerly picking at the ſmalleſt little ſeed. Louiſa ſtood ſome time looking at them, and was overjoyed at the ſight. She then went to her father and mother, beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging them to come and look too, and take part in her joy.</p>
            <p>BUT theſe little handfuls of grain were ſoon devoured. The birds flew to the edges of the roof of the houſe, and ſorrowfully looking at Louiſa, ſeemed to ſay: Have you nothing more to give us?</p>
            <p>LOUISA underſtood their language; and, ſwift as an arrow, ſhe ran in ſearch of more grain. In her way ſhe met with a boy who was carrying in his hand a cage filled with birds<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but who had by no means ſo compaſſionate a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>rt as Louiſa's; for he ſhook the cage ſo roughly, as he went along, that the poor little animals had their heads continually beat againſt the wire bars.</p>
            <p>LOUISA ſaw this with much concern. What are you going to do with th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ds? cried ſhe to the boy.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:026643_0019_0FD1079EDA15D370"/>I don't know yet, anſwered he, but I ſhall ſell them if I can; and if nobody will buy them, I ſhall make a feaſt of them for my cat.</p>
            <p>YOUR cat! cried Louiſa, your cat! O you wicked boy!</p>
            <p>O, they won't be the firſt, cried he, that ſhe has had to craunch alive between her teeth. And then, careleſsly ſwinging about the cage, he was walking off.</p>
            <p>LOUISA ſtopt him, and aſked how much he would have for them?</p>
            <p>I will ſell them all at a farthing a piece, he anſwered, and there are eighteen of them.</p>
            <p>VERY well, I'll take them of you, cried Louiſa; and bidding the boy follow her, ſhe hurried to her father, and begged his permiſſion to make the purchaſe.</p>
            <p>HER father readily conſented, and even gave her the uſe of an empty room to keep them in.</p>
            <p>THE boy, well ſatisfied with his bargain, then went away; and told all his comrades that he knew a young lady who bought people's birds.</p>
            <p>IN a few hours, there came ſo many other boys, with more of theſe little animals, to the court-yard before Louiſa's houſe, that the place ſeemed turned into a bird-market. They all preſſed about her when ſhe came in ſight, jump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one above the other, and lifting their cages up with both their hands, each trying to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>commend to her the birds belonging to himſelf.</p>
            <p>LOUISA bought all that were offered to her, and carried them into the room where ſhe had placed the others.</p>
            <p>SHE did not leave them till night; but never had ſhe gone to bed ſo pleaſed and delighted
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:026643_0020_0FD107ACAD28C2B0"/>
before. How happy I am, cried ſhe, to have ſaved the lives of ſo many innocent little crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and now to have the feeding of them myſelf! When ſummer comes, I will go into all the fields and woods; and then my little gueſts ſhall ſing me their prettieſt ſongs, to thank me for all this care I have taken of them.</p>
            <p>SHE cloſed her eyes with this thought, and dreamt that ſhe was ſtrolling in a very beautiful foreſt, where every tree was peopled with birds, hopping from branch to branch, and gaily warbling, or feeding their young: and Louiſa at the ſight ſmiled in her ſleep.</p>
            <p>SHE roſe very early, to get food for her little viſitors, both in her room and in the court-yard: but ſhe was not quite ſo happy to-day, as ſhe had been the night before. She knew what money ſhe had had in her purſe, and that but little could now remain. If this ſnowy weather laſts ſome days longer, cried ſhe, what will become of all the reſt of the birds? The wicked boys here will be giving the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ll alive to be eat up by their cats; and for want of a little more money, I ſhall not be able to ſave them.</p>
            <p>WITH theſe melancholy thoughts, ſhe ſlowly drew out her purſe, to count over the little trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure that was left.</p>
            <p>BUT what was her amazement to feel it quite heavy! She opened it, and found it full of coins of different value, mixed and heaped together.</p>
            <p>SHE flew to her father, and, in a tranſport of ſurpriſe and joy, related what had happened to her.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:026643_0021_0FD107ACB0E75150"/>HER father took her to his boſom, and, while he embraced her, wetted her cheeks with his tears.</p>
            <p>MY deareſt child, cried he, thou haſt never given me ſo much ſatisfaction as at this moment. Continue ſtill to aſſiſt all the little ſuffering crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that are in your power, and as faſt as your purſe is emptied, you ſhall again ſee it filled.</p>
            <p>WHAT joy was this for Louiſa! She ran in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to her birds apartment, with her apron full of hemp-ſeed and corn. The birds all flew to her, with eyes that ſhewed their eagerneſs for their breakfaſts. She then went down into the court-yard, where ſhe gave another plentiful repaſt to her hungry viſitors.</p>
            <p>SHE now ſaw that ſhe had near an hundred penſioners to nouriſh. What pleaſure, what rapture to her was this!</p>
            <p>NEVER had her dolls or her play-things af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forded her ſuch delight.</p>
            <p>IN the afternoon, as ſhe put her hand into her bag of ſeeds, ſhe found a little ſlip of paper, containing theſe words: "The inhabitants of the air fly towards thee, O Lord! and thou giveſt them nouriſhment: Thou putteſt forth thy hand, and poureſt down thy bleſſings upon every thing that has life."</p>
            <p>SHE eagerly turned to her father, who had followed her, and exclaimed: I, then, papa, am now like God; for the inhabitants of the air fly towards me, and when I put forth my hand, I pour down bleſſings upon them.</p>
            <p>YES, my child, ſaid her father, every time you do good to any living creature, you are
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:026643_0022_0FD107AFD99A13C0"/>
like God. When you are grown up, you may ſuccour your fellow-creatures, as you now ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cour theſe little birds: and then you will reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble God much more. What happineſs for a human being to be able to do any thing like God!</p>
            <p>DURING a week after this time, Louiſa con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued to <hi>put forth her hand, and pour down bleſſings</hi> upon all the little hungry animals that ſurrounded her. At length the ſnow melted; the fields recovered their verdure; and the birds, which had not dared venture from the houſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tops, now ſpread their wings towards the woods.</p>
            <p>BUT thoſe which were in her bird-apartment, were ſtill her gueſts. At the return of the ſun, they flew to the windows, and beat their little wings and bills againſt the glaſs; but all in vain: their priſon was too ſtrong for their reſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance; and Louiſa had no idea of their miſery.</p>
            <p>ONE day, when ſhe was carrying them ſome food, her father came into the room; and Louiſa was delighted to make him the ſpectator of her amuſement.</p>
            <p>BUT, my dear Louiſa, cried he, why do theſe birds look ſo reſtleſs and uneaſy? They ſeem to want ſomething. Perhaps they have left in the fields and woods, ſome companions they wiſh to ſee again.</p>
            <p>VERY true, papa; perhaps they have; for they have looked quite unhappy ever ſince the fine weather. I'll go and open the window, and let them fly away.</p>
            <p>I think you will do quite right, anſwered her father, for you will make a general joy through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the country. Theſe little priſoners will go
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:026643_0023_0FD107B20CFDCE40"/>
and find their companions again; and they will fly before them, juſt as you run before me, when I have been abſent a few days, and come home.</p>
            <p>ALL the windows were already open when he had finiſhed ſpeaking. The birds inſtantly perceived it, and, in a minute, not one remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the room. Some of them graſed the earth with their wings; others mounted upwards to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the ſky<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſome perched upon the adjoin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing trees; and others flew backwards and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards before the windows, ſinging and chirping, and rejoicing in the pleaſure of their reſtored liberty.</p>
            <p>LOUISA walked out in the country every day during ſummer, and, on each ſide, as ſhe turned, always heard or ſaw ſome birds. Now the early lark took its flight from her feet, and ſung his joyful ſong in aſcending to the clouds: and now the chaffinch twittered hers, as ſhe perched upon the tops of the buſhes: and when any one diſtinguiſhed i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

nevertheleſs ſupported by his induſtry, till there came ſo bad a ſeaſon, that the price of corn was raiſed, and bread was ſold dearer than ever. The good man worked day and night; yet, in ſpite of his utmoſt diligence, he could not earn money enough to buy even the worſt and cheap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt food for ſo many poor hungry children. He was ſoon therefore reduced to the utmoſt miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. One day he called about him all his family, and, with tears in his eyes, ſaid to them: My ſweet little ones, every thing is grown ſo dear, that with all my working I cannot get enough for your ſubſiſtence: this morſel of bread, that I now ſhew you, coſts me all the money that I can earn in the whole day. You muſt content yourſelves, therefore, to ſhare with me the little I am able to get: and though it will not be enough to ſatisfy you, it will ſerve to prevent your dying quite ſtarved. The poor man could ſay no more; he raiſed up his eyes to heaven, and ſobbed bitterly. His children all cried too; and every one ſaid to himſelf: O good God! come to our help, poor little miſerable things that we are! help to our poor father, and leave us not to die for hunger!</p>
            <p>BENNET then divided his loaf into ſeven equal parts; he kept a ſhare for himſelf, and gave the reſt among his children.

But it makes me very ſorrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful to ſee my poor little brothers, and my poor little ſiſters, all ſo hungry. And I am the eldeſt, and I am ſtronger than they are; ſo I had rather go without myſelf, than eat any of it from them. And this is the reaſon I made believe I was ill: but pray, Sir, don't tell my father, for it will only fret him.</p>
            <p>THE phyſician, wiping his eyes, ſaid: But you too, my good boy, are you not hungry yourſelf?</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Andrew.</speaker>
               <p>O yes, indeed, I am very hungry too; only that does not vex me ſo badly as ſeeing them ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Phyſician.</speaker>
               <p>But you muſt ſoon die your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, if you will take no nouriſhment.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Andrew.</speaker>
               <p>I know it very well, Sir, but I ſhall die with a very good heart; for my father will have one mouth leſs to fill: and when I go to God almighty, I ſhall beg him very hard to give my poor little brothers and ſiſters ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to eat.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>THE worthy phyſician felt the utmoſt tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and admiration as he liſtened to the ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of this generous child. He took him in
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:026643_0027_0FD107C25D449590"/>
his arms, preſſed him to his boſom, and ſaid to him: No, my excellent little lad, thou ſhalt not die; God, the father of us all, will take care of thee, and of all thy family. Give thanks to him, that he has ſent me to your aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance: I ſhall return to you preſently.</p>
            <p>HE then haſtened to his own houſe, and load<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one of his ſervants with all ſorts of proviſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he bid him attend him back to Andrew and his half-ſtarved little brothers and ſiſters. He made them all ſit down at a table, and deſired them to eat till every one was fully ſatisfied. It was a ſcene of true delight to this good phyſician, to witneſs the happineſs of theſe innocent creatures; and when he went away, he charged Andrew to ſuffer no further uneaſineſs, promiſing to ſupply them himſelf with all neceſſaries.</p>
            <p>HE faithfully kept his word, ſending them every day food in great plenty: and many other good and charitable perſons, to whom he told this adventure, imitated his benevolence. Some gave them proviſions, others money, and others linen and clothes; ſo that, in a very ſhort time, they had even more of every thing than they required.</p>
            <p>NO ſooner was Bennet's landlord, who was a nobleman of extenſive fortune and intereſt, informed of what the courageous little Andrew had ſuffered for the ſake of his father, and his brothers and ſiſters, than, ſtruck with admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion at ſuch generoſity and fortitude, he ſent for the poor man, and ſaid to him: You have a moſt wonderful ſon; and I will myſelf, alſo, be a father to him. I will ſettle you upon my own eſtate; and the reſt of your children ſhall be
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:026643_0028_0FD107C3CB9EF1F0"/>
educated to whatever trade they themſelves chuſe, and at my expence: and if they improve as they ought, I will take care to have them all provided for.</p>
            <p>BENNET returned home almoſt wild with joy; and, throwing himſelf upon his knees, gave thanks to heaven, for having bleſt him with ſo excellent a child.</p>

And ſo then, fool that I was!—I ought to have thought about the cake; but I did not think of any thing, I was ſo over-joyed to carry ſo much money to my daddy! So I had not counted it out myſelf, ſo I thought I would count it now. So I puts my fiddle on the ground, cloſe by my ſide, and I takes out the pocket handkerchief. See, ſays I, I have got this into the bargain; one of the Miſſes gave it me. So I had put all my money in it: but when I was going to untie the knot, he catched at it. So then I gueſſed at his ſpite: he pulled it to him, and I pulled it to me; when, all of a ſudden, he ſaw my fiddle lying upon the ground, and plump he ſat both his feet upon it! I let go my hold, in my fright; and then he pluck'd at the handkerchief, and runs off with it. My fiddle and bow are both broken; and I have neither my pocket-handkerchief nor my money!

So I took ſome money from my purſe, and gave it him: and he drew a hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kerchief out of his pocket, to put it in. I ſaw directly that it belonged to my ſiſter. Only look at the mark. I aſked him very mildly to give it me; but he would not. So I took him by the collar; and, in wreſtling together, by mere accident, I happened to trample upon his fiddle.</p>

            <head>THE CANARY BIRD.</head>
            <p>CANARY-birds to ſell! who'll buy Canary-birds? choice, fine Canary-birds! cried a voice that was paſſing by the houſe where Jami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma lived. Jamima heard it, and running to the window, looked into every part of the ſtreet. She then ſaw a man carrying upon his head a great cage filled with Canary-birds. They hopped ſo lightly from perch to perch, and warbled ſo ſweet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that Jamima, in the eagerneſs of her curioſity, almoſt threw herſelf out of the window, in order to ſee them yet nearer.</p>
            <p>MISS, ſaid the man, will you buy a Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry-bird?</p>
            <p>I will, if I may, anſwered Jamima; but I muſt not of my own accord: if you'll wait a little, I'll run and aſk leave of papa.</p>
            <p>THE man readily agreed to wait; and ſeeing a large poſt at the other end of the ſtreet, he went thither, and reſted his cage upon it. Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mima, in the mean time, ran to her father's room, and, quite out of breath, called out: papa! papa! pray come to the window! pray come directly!</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Godfrey.</speaker>

               <speaker>Jamima.</speaker>
               <p>I, papa!—I let him die of hunger or thirſt! O no, indeed. I will never touch a morſel of breakfaſt myſelf, till I have fed him.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Godfrey.</speaker>
               <p>O Jamima, Jamima, how giddy are you! And one ſingle day's forget<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs will kill him!</p>
            </sp>
            <p>JAMIMA, however, gave ſuch <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ir promiſes to her father; ſhe pleaded, entreated, hung by the ſkirt of his coat, and begged his conſent with ſo much earneſtneſs, that Mr. Godfrey, at length, could no longer refuſe it.</p>
            <p>HE then took her hand and led her into the ſtreet. They ſoon came up to the man, and choſe the moſt beautiful bird that was in his cage: his feathers were of the brighteſt yellow, and he had a little black creſt on the top of his head.</p>
            <p>WHO, now, was ſo happy as Jamima? She gave her purſe to her papa, that he might pay for it; and he then took money from his own,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:026643_0064_0FD10824A63F3E98"/>
to buy a very handſome cage, with two pretty drawers to hold ſeed, and a water-glaſs of cryſtal.</p>
            <p>NO ſooner had Jamima fixed her new favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite in its little palace, than ſhe flew all over the houſe, calling her mama, her ſiſters, and even all the ſervants, to ſhew them the bird which her papa had permitted her to buy. When any of her young friends came to ſee her, the firſt words ſhe ſaid to them, were always: Do you know I have got the prettieſt Canary-bird in the whole world? he is as yellow as gold, and he has a black tuft upon his head, juſt like the feathers in mama's hat. But come, and you ſhall ſee it: his name is Darling. I chriſtened him myſelf.</p>
            <p>DARLING, thus highly in favour, fared ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely well under the care of Jamima. The moment ſhe roſe every morning, her firſt thought was to procure him freſh ſeed, and the cleareſt water. Whenever there were any cakes or biſcuits at her father's table, Darling had his ſhare firſt. She had always ſome little bits of ſugar in reſerve for him: and his cage was gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed all round with chick-weed, and various good little things.</p>
            <p>DARLING was not ungrateful for her atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions: he ſoon learnt to diſtinguiſh Jamima from the reſt of the family; and the inſtant he heard her footſtep, he fluttered his little wings, and chirped without ceaſing. Jamima almoſt eat him up with kiſſes.</p>
            <p>IN about a week, he began to ſing, and his ſong was the prettieſt in the world. Sometimes he would warble his wild notes ſo long, that
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:026643_0065_0FD1082611FAFB48"/>
ſhe feared he muſt have died with fatigue in the middle of his little air; then, after a few mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments reſt, he would begin again, more ſweetly than ever, and with ſo clear and brilliant a tone, that he was heard all over the houſe.</p>
            <p>JAMIMA, ſeated by the ſide of his cage, ſpent whole hours in liſtening to him. Her work was frequently thrown aſide, that nothing might interrupt her looking at him: and when he had delighted her with one of his little ſongs, ſhe entertained him, in her turn, with an air upon the bird-organ, which he preſently ſtrove to imitate.</p>
            <p>BY degrees, however, theſe pleaſures became familiar, and loſt their power of charming. Her father one day made her a preſent of a book of prints; and ſhe was ſo much taken up with admiring them, that Darling was neglected. Still he fluttered his little wings, and chirped, the inſtant he ſaw Jamima; but Jamima no longer heard him.</p>
            <p>NEAR a week now paſſed, and Darling had neither freſh chick-weed, nor biſcuit. He ſung the prettieſt little ſongs that Jamima had taught him; he even compoſed new ones for her him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; but all in vain: Jamima had other things in her head.</p>
            <p>IT was now her birth-day; and her godfather preſented her with a great jointed doll. This doll, which ſhe called Colombine, completed the downfall of Darling. From the time ſhe roſe, to the hour of going to bed, ſhe had no thought, and no employment, but to dreſs and undreſs, again and again, this dumb little Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lombine; to talk to her, to call her by her
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:026643_0066_0FD10828E321CA28"/>
name, and to carry her in her arms up and down the room. The poor bird was now well enough off, if, towards the evening, ſhe remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered to give him a little food.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES, however, he had to wait for it till the next morning.</p>
            <p>AT length, one day when they were at table, Mr. Godfrey accidentally turning his eyes to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards the cage, ſaw the Canary-bird lying upon its ſtomach, and panting with great difficulty. His feathers almoſt ſtood an end, and he looked as round as a ball. Mr. Godfrey went up to him: but no chirping! no fluttering of his wings! the poor little animal had hardly ſtrength even to draw its breath.</p>
            <p>JAMIMA! cried Mr. Godfrey, with much diſpleaſure, what is the matter with your bird? Jamima, colouring, ſtammered out: Why, papa, it's—the thing is—why, I happened to forget—And, trembling and aſhamed, ſhe ran for the box of ſeed.</p>
            <p>MR. Godfrey took down the cage, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amined the drawers, and the water-glaſs. Alas! poor Darling had not one drop of water, nor one ſingle ſeed!</p>
            <p>O poor little bird! cried Mr. Godfrey, into what cruel hands have you fallen! If I had but foreſeen it, you ſhould never have been bought. All the company then roſe, and approached the cage, lifting up their hands with a look of pity, and calling out: O poor little bird!</p>
            <p>MR. Godfrey put ſome ſeed into both the drawers, and filled the glaſs with freſh water: and at length, though with much difficulty, Darling was brought back to life.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="62" facs="unknown:026643_0067_0FD10829CEB1BFD0"/>JAMIMA, crying, left the table, and running up to her own chamber, paſſed the reſt of the day in tears.</p>
            <p>THE next morning, Mr. Godfrey gave or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders that the bird ſhould be carried out of the houſe, and given to the ſon of Mr. Merſey, one of his neighbours, who had the character of being a very careful boy, and who, he hoped, would not forget him, as Jamima had done.</p>
            <p>THE ſorrow and repentance of the little girl grew now more and more violent. O my dear little bird! ſhe cried, my poor ſweet Darling! —O papa! dear, dear papa! indeed I will never forget him again; indeed, indeed, I promiſe you I will not. Only let me have him this once! this one ſingle time is all I beg!</p>
            <p>MR. Godfrey at length, moved by her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treaties, reſtored to her the Canary-bird; not, however, without a ſevere reproof for her paſt negligence, and a moſt earneſt charge that ſhe would be more attentive for the future. This poor little animal, ſaid he, is ſhut up in a cage, and has therefore no power to provide for its own wants. If <hi>you</hi> want any thing, you can at leaſt aſk for it; but this poor little bird can make nobody underſtand his language. If ever again you make him ſuffer, either from hunger or thirſt—</p>
            <p>AT theſe w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ds a ſhower of tears trickled down the cheeks of Jamima. She took her papa's hand, and kiſſed it, but her ſhame and ſorrow prevented her ſpeaking.</p>
            <p>JAMIMA was now once more the miſtreſs of Darling; and Darling was eaſily and cordially reconciled with Jamima.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="63" facs="unknown:026643_0068_0FD1082C2FE57598"/>ABOUT a month after, Mr. Godfrey and his lady were obliged to make a journey of a few days into the country. My dear Jamima, ſaid he, in taking leave, be very ſure you never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get the little Canary-bird.</p>
            <p>O no, papa! cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed ſhe; and ſcarcely were they ſeated in the carriage, before ſhe flew to the cage, and made it her firſt buſineſs to ſee that the bird ſhould have every thing it could poſſibly require.</p>
            <p>IN an hour or two, however, ſhe began to grow tired; ſhe ſent for ſome of her little friends to viſit her, and her gaiety returned. They all walked out together, and when they came back, they ſpent the firſt part of the evening in playing Blind-man's-buff, and Puſs-in-the-corner; and then they diverted themſelves with dancing. It was very late when the little party broke up, and Jamima went to bed quite wearied and fatigued.</p>
            <p>THE next morning ſhe awoke almoſt at the break of day, and could think of nothing but her laſt night's amuſements. If her governeſs would have given her leave, ſhe would have flown the very moment ſhe was dreſſed, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn the viſit of her young friends: but it was neceſſary to wait till the afternoon. Scarcely, however, had ſhe patience to finiſh her dinner, before ſhe deſired to be taken to them.</p>
            <p>AND what became of Darling? He was obliged to ſtay at home alone, and to faſt!</p>
            <p>THE next day, alſo, was ſpent in nothing but amuſements.</p>
            <p>AND Darling?—He was forgotten again!</p>
            <p>THE third day it was ſtill the ſame.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="64" facs="unknown:026643_0069_0FD1082D989749C0"/>AND Darling?—Why, who would think of him in the midſt of ſuch diverſions?</p>
            <p>THE fourth day Mr and Mrs. Godfrey came home from their journey Jamima had thought but little about their return: but her father had no ſooner embraced her, and enqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red after her health, than he ſaid: And how is Darling?</p>
            <p>O, very well, anſwered Jamima, a little ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed, and running to the cage for the bird.</p>
            <p>ALAS! the poor little animal was no more! it was lying upon its back, its wings ſtretched out, and its beak open.</p>
            <p>JAMIMA wrung her hands, and ſcream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed aloud. Every body ran to her, and ſaw what had happened.</p>
            <p>POOR little hapleſs animal! cried Mr. God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>frey, how painful has been thy death! Had I but myſelf deſtroyed thee on the day of my departure, thy ſufferings would at leaſt have been but for a moment; while now, for ſo many days, thou haſt borne all the pangs of hunger and thirſt, and thy death has been at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with the moſt cruel and lingering pains.

            <p>MR. Godfrey, after many entreaties, at length conſented: but every time ſhe was guilty of any fault or folly, the bird was again put in its place; and ſhe heard the whole family exclaiming: Poor unfortunate animal! how cruel a death haſt thou ſuffered!</p>

            <p>THE clock now ſtruck eleven, and a ſecond hour had been loſt in quarreling. Leander, in a rage, flung his whip out of the window; Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia threw her doll into a corner. They looked at each other, but neither of them knew what to ſay.</p>

               </gap>ger than ever. Leander brought back his whip; Julia again took her doll; but the whip no longer ſounded to his mind, and every thing went wrong at the doll's toilette. Leander ſighed; Julia wept. At length the dinner-bell rang, and Mr. Dartrey himſelf made enquiries if they were ready to come to the table. But what, cried he, ſeeing them both ſo ſad, what is the matter with you?</p>
            <p>NOTHING at all, papa, anſwered the children; and drying their eyes, they followed their father into the dining parlour.</p>
            <p>THEY had, this day, a variety of diſhes upon the table, and each a bottle of wine upon the ſide-board.</p>
            <p>MY dear children, ſaid Mr. Dartrey, had I ſtill any authority over you, I ſhould forbid you taſting all theſe diſhes, and ſtill more your drink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any wine: or, at leaſt, I ſhould help you to very little, from my knowledge of the danger of wine and ſpices to children. But you are now your own managers, and muſt eat and drink according to your diſcretion.</p>
            <p>THE children waited not to be told this twice: one ſwallowed great mouthfuls of meat without bread, the other took the gravy and ſauce in large ſpoonfuls; and both of them poured out full bumpers of wine, without thinking of mix<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it with water.</p>
            <p>BUT, my dear, ſaid Mrs. Dartrey, in a whiſper to her huſband, they will make them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves quite ill.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="71" facs="unknown:026643_0076_0FD1083B5E6900F0"/>I fear ſo too, replied Mr. Dartrey; yet I would rather they ſhould learn, even at their own ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penſe, for once, the miſchief of ignorance, than, by too much attention to their health, deprive them of ſo important a leſſon.</p>
            <p>MRS. Dartrey, ſeeing the deſign of her huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band, would not interfere, but left the little ſimpletons to the enjoyment of their gluttony.</p>
            <p>THEY now roſe from table; the children having eat till they were too full to ſwallow a morſel more, and drank till their little heads began already to be heated.</p>
            <p>COME along Julia, cried Leander; and he carried his ſiſter with him into the garden.</p>
            <p>MR. Dartrey thought it neceſſary to follow their footſteps.</p>
            <p>THERE was a ſmall piece of water in the garden, and cloſe to its border a little boat. Leander had a fancy to get into it.</p>
            <p>JULIA ſtopped him. You know very well cried ſhe, we are forbid going there. Forbid! replied he; have you forgot that we are to do juſt what we like?</p>
            <p>O, very true! cried Julia; and giving her hand to her brother, they both jumped into the boat.</p>
            <p>MR. Dartrey now approached nearer, but did not yet think proper to diſcover himſelf. He knew the water was not very deep, and that, if they fell into it, he ſhould not have much trouble in drawing them out again.</p>
            <p>THE children endeavoured to looſen the boat from the ſide, and puſh it into the middle of the water; but they could not contrive to untie the knots of the cord with which it was faſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tened.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="72" facs="unknown:026643_0077_0FD1083DA6495888"/>WELL, if we can't ſail, cried the hair-brained Leander, we can at leaſt play at balancing. They then jumped backwards and forwards acroſs the boat, now making it lean on one ſide, now on the other.</p>
            <p>THEIR heads being a little confuſed, it was not long before their feet began to ſtagger. Each caught hold of the other for a prop; but they both fell inſtantly upon the edge of the boat, and from the edge of the boat, <hi>plump,</hi> into the water.</p>
            <p>MR. Dartrey, ſwift as lightning, now flew from the place where he had been concealed. He flung himſelf into the water, ſeized in each hand one of his daring little children, and car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried them, half dead with terror, into the houſe.</p>
            <p>THEY were now very ſick, but inſtantly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed, and rubbed with flannel. They were then each put into a warm bed, where they lay ſucceſſively in a ſtate of extreme weakneſs, or in convulſions. They had a moſt dreadful head-ach, and a pain in the ſtomach they could hardly endure. They fainted away ſeveral times; and every fainting was followed by ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible ſickneſs, and much difficulty of breathing.</p>
            <p>IN this deplorable manner they paſſed the reſt of the day. They ſhed tears in abundance; they ſobbed aloud; till, at length, fatigued with ſorrow and ſuffering, they cried themſelves to ſleep.</p>
            <p>EARLY the next morning, their father came into the chamber, and deſired to know how they had paſſed the night.</p>
            <p>O, very ill, papa! cried they, both at once, and in a very feeble voice; we could hardly ſleep at all, and we have the head-ach and the ſtomach-ach ſtill.</p>

               <pb n="73" facs="unknown:026643_0078_0FD1084051F42D18"/>POOR little things! ſaid their father, how ſorry I am for you! But what, added he a moment after, do you purpoſe doing with your liberty to-day? You have it ſtill, you know, in your own poſſeſſion.</p>
            <p>O no, no! cried they with eagerneſs, and both in a breath.</p>
            <p>WHY how now? cried he; did you not tell me, the other day, how ſad it was to obey the directions of other people?</p>
            <p>YES, papa, anſwered Leander; but we have been well puniſhed for that fooliſhneſs.</p>
            <p>O yes; added Julia, and indeed we ſhall not ſoon forget it!</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Dartrey.</speaker>
               <p>Very well; here is a yellow powder called Rhubarb. Its taſte is bad, but its quality is excellent for thoſe whoſe ſtomachs have been put out of order by any exceſs. Since you conſent to follow my directions, I deſire you to take this powder immediately. Obey quick!</p>

            <p>MR. Dartrey prepared the medicine, and gave it them.

            <p>FROM this time, whenever they were threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened with any terrible puniſhment for their faults, it was by ſaying:

            <head>THE THORN-BUSHES.</head>
            <p>IN a very fine evening in the month of May, Mr. Dalton, ſeated himſelf, with his ſon Arthur, upon the ſide of a little hill; whence he taught him to view and admire the beauties of the proſpect before him, which the ſetting ſun, in bidding adieu, ſeemed to clothe in a robe of purple. They were a little diſturbed, however, from this pleaſing ſtudy, by the loud ſinging of a ſhepherd, who was bringing back his bleating flock from the neighbouring mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dow. At each ſide of the road he went along, there were buſhes full of thorns, upon which every ſheep that approached, left ſome part of its fleece.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="75" facs="unknown:026643_0080_0FD10847E737D738"/>LITTLE Arthur, young and eager, was quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in a paſſion with theſe robbers. See! ſee! papa, cried he, only look at thoſe naſty thorns, that are ſtealing the wool from the ſheep! Why did God make thoſe wicked brambles? or why does not every body, of one accord, go and root them all up? If the poor ſheep ſhould come back again by the ſame way, they would leave all the reſt of their clothing with them. But no! I won't let them; for I will get up myſelf to-morrow morning, by break of day, and come with my little bill, and <hi>ſnip, ſnap,</hi> I will cut down every one of the thorn-buſhes: and if you will come with me too, papa, and bring your great wood-knife, the buſineſs will all be done before breakfaſt.</p>
            <p>WE will think of your ſcheme replied Mr. Dalton; but, mean time, be not ſo unjuſt to thoſe thorns: recollect what happens in ſheep-ſhearing time.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Arthur.</speaker>
               <p>What is that, papa?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dalton.</speaker>
               <p>Did you never ſee the ſhepherds, with their great ſhears in their hands, ſtrip the poor trembling ſheep, not merely of light tufts of wool, but of their whole fleece?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Arthur.</speaker>
               <p>Very true, papa; for then they wanted it for their clothes: but theſe thorns tear it off from mere ill-nature, and without wanting it at all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dalton.</speaker>
               <p>You know not what purpoſe this may anſwer to them: but even ſuppoſing it to be of no uſe, is the want of a thing ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient reaſon for ſeizing it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Arthur.</speaker>
               <p>I have heard you ſay, papa, that the ſheep naturally loſe their fleece about this
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:026643_0081_0FD1084A53485B08"/>
time of the year: therefore is it not better to cut it off for our own good, than to let it fall off for nothing at all?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dalton.</speaker>
               <p>Your obſervation is juſt. All beaſts have a dreſs from nature, and from their's we borrow our's: for if we did not, we ſhould be forced to go quite naked, and expoſed to all the cruel injuries of the weather.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Arthur.</speaker>
               <p>But the thorns have no need of any dreſs at all; therefore there can be no reaſon to ſpare them. To-morrow I will abſolutely cut down every briar. You will come with me, papa, won't you?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dalton.</speaker>
               <p>Certainly. To-morrow, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, we will meet at the very break of day.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>ARTHUR, who thought himſelf already a hero, from the mere idea of deſtroying, with his own little hand, this legion of robbers, could with difficulty ſleep all night, ſo full was his mind of his victories for the next morning: and ſcarce had the gay chirping of the birds, perched upon the trees near his windows, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed the return of Aurora, before he haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to awake his father; while Mr. Dalton, tho' little occupied with the deſtruction of the thorns, yet charmed with an opportunity of ſhewing to his ſon the opening beauties of the riſing morn, was not leſs eager to quit his bed. They dreſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves with ſpeed, took up their arms, and ſet out upon their expedition. Arthur, with an air of triumph, went firſt, and Mr. Dalton was hardly able to keep pace with him. In approaching the thorns, they ſaw that they were almoſt covered with little birds, hopping to and fro, and fluttering upon the branches.
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:026643_0082_0FD1084C892D7108"/>
Softly, ſoftly! cried Mr. Dalton to his ſon; let us defer, for a moment, our vengeance, leſt we ſhould diſturb theſe pretty innocent creatures. We will go again to that part of the hill where we were ſeated laſt night, and try to find out what it is that theſe little birds are ſeeking in the buſhes, with ſo buſy and occupied an air. They aſcended the hill, ſat down, and looked on. They then perceived that the birds carried away in their bills thoſe very tufts of wool which the thorns had caught from the ſheep the preceding evening; and that chaffinches, linnets, and nightingales, came in large num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers to enrich themſelves with the ſpoil.</p>
            <p>WHAT does this mean? cried Arthur, all aſtoniſhed.</p>
            <p>IT means, replied his father, that Providence takes care of the ſmalleſt creatures, and furniſhes them with all ſorts of methods for their happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and preſervation. You ſee here how the poor birds find <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>apeſtry for the habitations they build for their little ones; and how ſoft and warm a bed they prepare for their young family. Thus thoſe honeſt thorn-buſhes, with which but yeſterday you were ſo eaſily provoked, unite the inhabitants of the air with thoſe of the earth: they take from the rich what is more than they can uſe, to give to the poor what they abſolute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly need. Will you come, then, now, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy them?</p>
            <p>O heaven forbid! exclaimed Arthur.</p>
            <p>YOU are right, my child, anſwered Mr. Dal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tun; let them flouriſh in peace, ſince they make ſo generous a uſe of their conqueſts.</p>

            <p>THERE was once a certain crazy man whoſe name was Joſeph, who never went out without putting five or ſix wigs, one piled above another, upon his head, and as many muffs upon each of his arms. But though his ſenſes were diſordered, he was not miſchievous, nor ever, unleſs much teazed and provoked, in a paſſion. Yet he could not walk in the ſtreets, without being ſurround<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a ſet of idle and impertinent little boys, who always tormented and followed him, calling out: Here, Joſeph, Joſeph! What will you ſell your wigs for? what will you take for your muffs? Some of them were even wicked enough to throw ſtones after him. Poor Joſeph com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly bore theſe inſults with great patience; though at times, when peſtered and vexed be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond meaſure, he would fall into a rage, and gather pebbles, or take up whole handfuls of mud, to fling at the unfeeling little fellows.</p>
            <p>IT happened, one day, that this diſturbance was made juſt before the houſe of Mr. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ennis. The noiſe of it carried him to the window, where he had the ſorrow to ſee that his own ſon, Henry, was in the midſt of the crowd. The moment he obſerved it, he ſhut down the ſaſh, and retired into another apartment.</p>
            <p>WHEN they met at dinner, Mr. Dennis ſaid to his ſon: Who was that man you were run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after, and calling to, and ſhouting at ſo loud?</p>

               <speaker>Harry.</speaker>
               <p>They ſay it was a law-ſuit for a great eſtate. He was ſo vexed at loſing it, that it made him loſe his ſenſes beſides.</p>

I have loſt an eſtate upon which I lived in peace and happineſs; and all that I had beſides is gone in the expences of the law-ſuit: I have now neither a houſe in town, nor a houſe in the country; every thing I was worth is taken from me!" would you then have laughed at him, and made game of him?</p>

            <p>HARRY was faithful to his promiſe; he re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of his fault, and at night he begged pardon of God with a true and penitent heart: and for ſome weeks after, he not only left poor Joſeph at peace himſelf, but frequently prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his companions from abuſing him.</p>
            <p>YET, notwithſtanding all his good reſoluti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, he one day mixed again in the crowd of idle boys that purſued him. It was merely, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed, from curioſity, and to ſee what tricks
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:026643_0086_0FD0F9BC8DB8E4C8"/>
they would play the poor man. Yet, from time to time, he ſhouted out with the reſt: Joſeph! Joſeph! and, by degrees, he found himſelf the foremoſt in the ſet; till at length Joſeph, provoked with the noiſe and hallooing, ſuddenly turned round and ſnatching up a great ſtone, flung it at him with ſuch fury, that it grazed his check, and made his noſe guſh out with blood.</p>
            <p>HARRY returned home all bloody, and roar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing aloud. This is a juſt puniſhment from God for your diſobedience, ſaid his father. But why, cried Harry, why am I the only one to come ſo ill off, when all the reſt, though they did a thouſand times worſe than me, have not been puniſhed at all? The reaſon, anſwer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed his father, is, that you know much better than the others the fault you were committing, and therefore you were the moſt criminal. A child who is well inſtructed in the commands of God, as well as in thoſe of his father, me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits to be doubly chaſtiſed when he has the worthleſſneſs to break them.</p>

                  <p>It is much better, my Lord, to believe all men wicked, till we are convinced, and that paſt any doubt, of their honeſty.

You judge that this little girl filled her baſket here, becauſe you found her by a ſheaf in this field: you judge that the ſteward has been corrupted with money, becauſe he has countenanced a
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:026643_0102_0FD0F9CE170AED00"/>
poor family in coming to ſettle in the village? Very well: I alſo then judge, that you only kept the little girl's baſket, becauſe ſhe had no money to give you, nor even any thing to drink; for, if ſhe had, I conclude you would willingly have releaſed her.</p>

                  <p>Willingly, my dear boy. When I took him into my ſervice, I gave him orders to keep all vagabonds from my grounds, or, if he ſurpriſed any upon them, to carry them before the magiſtrate.

                  <p>Ah, I underſtand, now, how it is.

My baggage had been plundered, and I was ſtripped both of clothes and money. Colonel Jefferſon, who was informed of my ſituation, immediately had me recommended to the enemy's General. I obtained, by his good offices, all the aſſiſtance that I required, in the treatment of a deep wound which I had received in the engagement. It was more than two years before I recovered.

            <p>BEFORE the ſun was riſen above the hori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, to give light to the moſt beautiful morning of the ſpring, the young Arabella was already in her father's garden, intending to make her breakfaſt a greater regale to her, by firſt ſtrolling up and down the long alleys. What<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever could add to the charms of theſe earlieſt hours of the day, ſeemed now united to delight her. The purity and freſhneſs of the air, gave a calm to all her ſenſes. Her taſte was gratified by the delicacy of the ſweet-meats ſhe was eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; her eye, by the ſoft luſtre of the new-born green; her ſmell, by the ſweet perfume of a thouſand flowers; and, leſt her ear alone ſhould
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:026643_0117_0FD108A9B603E950"/>
remain unſoothed, two nightingales perched themſelves upon the ſummit of an arbour juſt by, as if purpoſely to rejoice her with their morning ſongs. Arabella was ſo enchanted with the lovelineſs of the ſcene around her, that tears of pleaſure ſtarted into her eyes, though they eſcaped not down her cheeks. Her heart, beating with the ſofteſt feelings, was filled with tenderneſs and benevolence: when, all at once, her pleaſing thoughtfulneſs was interrupted by the ſound of the feet of a little girl, who was coming into the ſame alley, and devouring with great greedineſs a thick ſlice of brown bread.</p>
            <p>AS ſhe, alſo, was walking in the garden only to divert herſelf, ſhe looked all round her, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out noticing any particular object, and advanced cloſe up to Arabella, without perceiving her. The moment ſhe ſaw her, ſhe ſtopped ſhort, and caſt her eyes on the ground; and then, with the ſwiftneſs of a terrified young deer, ſhe haſtily turned back the ſame way ſhe came.</p>
            <p>STOP, ſtop, cried Arabella, ſtay for me, lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle girl, ſtay for me! What do you run ſo for? But theſe words only made the little ruſtic fly the quicker.</p>
            <p>ARABELLA began to follow her; but being leſs practiſed in ſuch races, found it impoſſible <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> overtake her. Fortunately, however, ſhe had run into a winding path, in order to get out of the garden; and the alley in which ſhe had eſcaped from Arabella, led directly to the garden-gate. Arabella, who was no leſs ſenſible than pretty, crept, therefore, ſoftly along the ſide of a thick hedge, which bordered the walk; and arrived at the laſt buſh, at the very inſtant the
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:026643_0118_0FD108AC5B1ACC08"/>
little girl was obliged to paſs it in her way out.</p>
            <p>SHE now ſuddenly ſeized her, calling out: Ah ha! you are my priſoner! I have you ſafe, you cannot run away any more.</p>
            <p>THE little girl ſtruggled to get out of her hands. Don't be ſo naughty, cried Arabella; if you knew the good I mean to do you, you would not be ſo fierce. Come, there's a good girl, come with me for a little while.</p>
            <p>THESE friendly words, and ſtill more the ſoothing voice in which they were ſpoken, gave the little girl ſome courage, and ſhe followed Arabella into a ſummer-houſe.</p>
            <p>HAVE you ever a father? ſaid Arabella, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her ſeat herſelf next to her.</p>

               <p>And what does he do?</p>

               <speaker>Peggy.</speaker>
               <p>Any thing he can, to get his living. He is come to-day to work in your garden, and he brought me with him.</p>

               <p>O, I ſee him down there, in the kitchen-garden. 'Tis that great fat man. But what are you eating for your breakfaſt? Let me taſte a bit of your bread. O goodneſs! how it hurts my throat! Why does not your father give you better bread than this?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Peggy.</speaker>
               <p>Becauſe he has not ſo much money as your papa has: ſo he can't let us have nice things.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Arabella.</speaker>
               <p>But he gets ſome money by his work; and I think he might at leaſt give you a little white bread, or elſe ſomething ſweet to make you get this down.</p>

               <p>Yes, if I was his only child; but we are five of us, and we have all good appe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tites at our meals. Beſides, one is wanting a waiſtcoat, and another a jacket, and another a gown: and all that makes daddy almoſt out of his head; and he ſays, ſometimes, I may work and work, all day long; but I ſhall never get enough to feed and clothe all theſe brats.</p>

               <p>Very well, my good Peggy, wait here a minute or two, and I'll go and beg ſomething for you of my governeſs, and come back preſently. Now pray don't run away in the mean time.</p>

            <p>ARABELLA flew to her governeſs, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated ſhe would give her ſome ſweet cakes, that ſhe might let a poor little girl have ſome, who had nothing but dry bread for her break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt. The governeſs was charmed with the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nevolence of her amiable pupil: ſhe gave her ſome in a ſaucer, with a new-baked roll; and

Arabella then, with all the ſpeed in her power, ran back to carry them to Peggy for her break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt.</p>
            <p>WELL, cried ſhe, when ſhe came up to her, did I tire your patience with waiting? Here, then, ſee what I have brought you! Come, take ſome; never mind that ſtale bread; you can eat enough of that at any time.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Arabella.</speaker>
               <p>I am ſorry for that. However, come and ſee me every now and then, and I'll give you ſome. But what a healthy look you have! Are you never ill?</p>

            <p>ARABELLA had now enjoyed the happineſs of doing good.

            <p>THE next morning, Peggy again ſlipped in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the garden; and Arabella gave her ſome ſweet-meats which ſhe had bought for her.</p>

               <pb n="118" facs="unknown:026643_0123_0FD108C0A655B0B0"/>PEGGY now failed not to come every morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and Arabella thought of nothing but what new dainties ſhe could procure for her. When her own pocket-money was inſufficient to buy all ſhe wanted, ſhe begged her mama's leave to take ſweet-meats and preſerves out of the houſe-keeper's room: and her mama conſented with pleaſure.</p>
            <p>ONE day, however, Arabella had the mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tification of a refuſal. She aſked her mama to advance her weekly allowance, that ſhe might buy ſhoes and ſtockings for Peggy, and not let her go about bare-footed any more.</p>
            <p>NO, I cannot, my dear Arabella, anſwered her mama.</p>
            <p>AND why not, mama?</p>
            <p>I will tell you at table, by and by, ſhe repli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, the reaſon that makes me wiſh you to be a little leſs extravagant for your favourite.</p>
            <p>ARABELLA was much ſurpriſed at this denial; and never before ſo eagerly waited for dinner<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>time. At length it arrived, and all the family ſeated themſelves at table.</p>
            <p>THE dinner, however, was almoſt over, and ſtill not a word was ſaid that led to the ſubject of Peggy's ſhoes and ſtockings. But, at laſt, a plate of ſhrimps was ſet on the table, and Mrs. Alliſon began the following converſation.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Alliſon.</speaker>
               <p>O, here comes my Arabella's favourite diſh; is it not? I am very glad we happened to have it to-day.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Arabella.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, mama, I love ſhrimps very much, and this is the ſeaſon when they are beſt.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Alliſon.</speaker>
               <p>And Peggy, I dare ſay, would like them ſtill better than you do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <pb n="119" facs="unknown:026643_0124_0FD108C3D53060A0"/>
               <speaker>Arabella.</speaker>
               <p>O, poor little Peggy, I dare ſay ſhe never ſaw any in her life. If I was only to ſhew her theſe long whiſkers, ſhe would be as frightened—O, how frightened ſhe would be! I think I ſee her now, running away with all her might. Mama, if you would give me leave, I ſhould like vaſtly to ſee what faces ſhe would make at them. Two will be enough for her, if they are the two <hi>leaſt</hi> in the diſh.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Alliſon.</speaker>
               <p>This is a requeſt, my dear, that I know not how to grant.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Arabella.</speaker>
               <p>And why, mama, why not? You, that always do ſo many good things for every body? And when I aſked you for ſome money this morning, to buy Peggy ſhoes and ſtockings, you refuſed it me: ſo I ſuppoſe poor Peggy has made you angry. Has ſhe taken any fruit, or any thing out of the garden, mama? O, I will ſcold her well for it, if ſhe has.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Alliſon.</speaker>
               <p>No, my dear Arabella, Peggy has not made me angry at all: but do you mean, by the things you do for her, to make her hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py or miſerable?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Arabella.</speaker>
               <p>Happy, mama; God forbid I ſhould make her miſerable!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Alliſon.</speaker>
               <p>And I too, my love, heartily wiſh her better fortune, ſince you think ſhe me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits your regard. But is it certainly true, Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella, that ſhe has nothing but dry bread for her breakfaſt?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Arabella.</speaker>
               <p>Very true, really, mama; for I am ſure I would not deceive you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Alliſon.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed! and has that ſatisfied her quite till now?</p>

               <speaker>Arabella.</speaker>
               <p>O dear, yes, mama: and if I was to have the niceſt Savoy biſcuits, I could not eat them with more pleaſure than ſhe eats her dry brown bread.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Alliſon.</speaker>
               <p>It ſeems, then, ſhe has a very good appetite. But I don't know how to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe ſhe goes always bare-footed.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Arabella.</speaker>
               <p>Indeed ſhe has always been bare-footed whenever I have ſeen her; only aſk the gardener elſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Alliſon.</speaker>
               <p>I dare ſay, then, her feet are all covered with blood, when ſhe has been walking upon ſand, or ſtones.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Arabella.</speaker>
               <p>No, not at all. She runs about the garden like a fawn; and ſhe laughs, and ſays that God himſelf has ſewed a pair of hard ſoles upon the bottom of her feet.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Alliſon.</speaker>
               <p>I know very well that my Arabella is no ſtory-teller; but yet, I muſt own I have ſome difficulty in believing all this. O, what wry faces would you make, if we were to give <hi>you</hi> dry brown bread, without any but<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, or ſweet-meats!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Arabella.</speaker>
               <p>O indeed, mama, I know very well it would ſtop in my throat.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Alliſon.</speaker>
               <p>And I ſhould like, alſo, to ſee how you would manage if we let you go bare-foot.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Arabella.</speaker>
               <p>Why, mama, now don't be angry, but yeſterday I had a mind to try. When I was alone in the garden, I took off my ſhoes and ſtockings, on purpoſe to walk about like Peggy: but I found my feet ſadly cut.—How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I reſolved to trot on: but at laſt, I came plump on a ſharp flint! O, it hurt me ſo!—
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:026643_0126_0FD108C984D0BA20"/>
I hurried back as faſt as poſſible, though I pick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the beſt way I could; and indeed, mama, I'll give you my word, I'll never go about bare-foot any more. Poor little Peggy! do you know ſhe walks ſo, mama, all ſummer long?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Alliſon.</speaker>
               <p>But what is the reaſon, then, that you can't eat dry bread, and go bare-foot, as well as ſhe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Arabella.</speaker>
               <p>I ſuppoſe, mama, it's becauſe I am not uſed to it.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Alliſon.</speaker>
               <p>But if you ſhould accuſtom her to the ſame delicacies you love yourſelf, and to wear ſhoes and ſtockings, and then the dry bread ſhould be diſtaſteful to her, and walking barefoot ſhould hurt her, do you think you would have done her any kindneſs?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Arabella.</speaker>
               <p>No, mama; but I want to ſerve her in ſuch a manner, that ſhe ſhall never be in that bad way any more.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Alliſon.</speaker>
               <p>That's a very generous wiſh; but can you ſave enough of your pocket-money to anſwer ſuch a purpoſe?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Arabella.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, very well, mama, if you'll only help me a little.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Alliſon.</speaker>
               <p>You know well that I never refuſe to aſſiſt the poor or diſtreſſed, when a proper occaſion offers: but is Peggy the only little girl you know that wants help?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Arabella.</speaker>
               <p>No, mama, I know a great many others beſides; and eſpecially two that live here by the village, that have neither father nor mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Alliſon.</speaker>
               <p>Doubtleſs, then, they are in want of many things.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Arabella.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, indeed, mama, they are.</p>

               <pb n="122" facs="unknown:026643_0127_0FD108C986DABED8"/>
               <speaker>Mrs. Alliſon.</speaker>
               <p>But if you give every thing to Peggy, and feed her with biſcuits and ſweet-meats, while the other poor things are left to ſtarve with hunger; do you think you are act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing either with juſtice or humanity?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Arabella.</speaker>
               <p>But I can give them ſomething too, from time to time, mama; only I love Peggy the beſt of any of them.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Alliſon.</speaker>
               <p>And if you ſhould die, after uſing Peggy to all theſe luxuries—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Arabella.</speaker>
               <p>I am ſure, if I did, mama, ſhe would cry.</p>

               <speaker>Mrs. Alliſon.</speaker>
               <p>I can eaſily believe it. But ſhe muſt then again ſink into indigence, or elſe, perhaps, commit bad actions, in order ſtill to eat what ſhe liked, and dreſs herſelf as you had dreſſed her. Who then would be guilty of her ruin?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Arabella</speaker>
               <p>
                  <stage>(with ſadneſs.)</stage>
I, mama! So then, I ſuppoſe, I muſt give her nothing more?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Alliſon.</speaker>
               <p>That is not my intention. I think, however, that you will do well to buy her fewer good things to eat, and rather beſtow your money in purchaſing her plain and tidy clothes.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Arabella.</speaker>
               <p>I was thinking of that, mama, myſelf. Suppoſe I give her one of my own robes?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Alliſon.</speaker>
               <p>I think your roſe-colour ſattin will ſuit her admirably, eſpecially when ſhe runs about bare-foot.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Arabella.</speaker>
               <p>O no! every body will point at her with their fingers! What can I do, mama?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Alliſon.</speaker>
               <p>If I were in your place, I ſhould be very ſaving, for ſome time, in my pleaſures,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:026643_0128_0FD108D0C7031310"/>
till I had got together a little ſum of money; and then I would employ it in buying for her whatever I found ſhe moſt wanted. The things that ſerve for clothes to the children of the poor, are not very expenſive.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>ARABELLA followed her mama's advice. She called Peggy but ſeldom to partake of her break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt; but ſhe frequently made her other, and far more uſeful preſents. Sometimes ſhe gave her an apron, ſometimes a petticoat, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times a cap: and ſhe paid herſelf for her ſchool<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that ſhe might be properly taught to read.</p>
            <p>PEGGY was ſo much delighted by theſe bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>factions, that ſhe every day attached herſelf more and more tenderly to Arabella. She would fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently run after her, to ſay: Have you any thing I can do for you, Miſs Arabella? Can I go of any errand? And, whenever Arabella found her ſome employment, nothing could equal the joy with which Peggy haſtened to oblige her.</p>
            <p>SHE went one day to the garden-gate, to wait for Arabella's coming; but after ſtaying far beyond the uſual time, Arabella appeared not. Peggy was forced to go home, but ſoon returned to watch again; but again ſhe ſaw no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Arabella. Two days following, ſhe continued to come at the accuſtomed hours; but no Arabella was ready to receive her.</p>
            <p>POOR Peggy was now in the utmoſt diſtreſs, that her benefactreſs ſeemed thus to have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaken her.</p>
            <p>AH! cried ſhe, does not ſhe love me any longer? May be I have made her angry without know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it. I am ſure if I could tell what it was,
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:026643_0129_0FD108D42E6522E0"/>
I would beg her pardon again and again; for I ſhall die, now, if ſhe will not love me always!</p>
            <p>AT this moment, Mrs. Alliſon's maid hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to come out of the garden. Peggy ran after her. Pray tell me, cried ſhe, where Miſs Arabella is?</p>
            <p>MISS Arabella? ſaid the maid, ſhe is very ill; ſhe has not perhaps, many hours to live. I think her quite at the laſt moment; ſhe has got the ſmall-pox.</p>
            <p>O good God! exclaimed Peggy, ſhe muſt not die! I can't let her die!</p>
            <p>SHE then flew into the houſe, and ran up ſtairs into Mrs. Alliſon's room. O good Lady, ſhe cried, for pity's ſake tell me where is Miſs Arabella, and let me go to her!</p>
            <p>MRS. Alliſon would have ſtopped her, but ſhe had ſeen, through the door, which was half open, Arabella's bed: and ſhe was already at its ſide.</p>
            <p>ARABELLA was in all the reſtleſs pain of a violent fever. She was alone, and very melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>choly; for all her young friends had been taken from her.</p>
            <p>PEGGY, crying bitterly, caught hold of her hand, preſſed it between her own, kiſſed it a hundred times, and ſaid: Ah! good God! what a way do I ſee you in! O, don't die, I beg you! What muſt I do if I ſhould loſe you? I will ſtay with you both day and night; I will watch over you, and wait upon you.—May I, Miſs Arabella? will you let me?</p>
            <p>ARABELLA preſſed her hand, and eaſily made her underſtand that ſhe conſented with pleaſure to her offer.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="125" facs="unknown:026643_0130_0FD108E076251198"/>PEGGY now, with the permiſſion of Mrs. Alliſon, became the conſtant attendant of Ara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bella; and whatever ſhe was ſuffered to do for her, ſhe was careful ſhould be done as well as poſſible. They made up a bed for her upon the floor, by the ſide of the little invalid; and ſhe never for an inſtant quitted her. When Arabella only made the ſlighteſt murmur, Peg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy jumped up to enquire what was the matter. She gave her all her phyſic herſelf. Sometimes ſhe gathered ruſhes, in order to amuſe her by ſhewing her how ſhe could make pretty baſkets; at other times, ſhe hunted over Mrs. Alliſon's library, to find out prints for her to look at. Her mind was always employed in thinking of ſomething to entertain her, and make her for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>get her ſufferings. During one week of the time, Arabella loſt her eye-ſight by her diſorder; and this week ſeemed very long indeed: yet Peggy aſſiſted her to bear it, by diverting her with the hiſtory of all the village; and, as ſhe had improved very much by her leſſons of read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe picked out for her all the books ſhe thought ſhe would like to hear; and frequently, in a very tender manner, ſhe would endeavour to give her comfort: Only have a little patience, ſhe would ſay, and God will take pity on you, as you uſed to take pity on me. At this re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>membrance, ſhe would cry; but, ſoon drying her eyes, ſay more chearfully: Come, Miſs Arabella, ſhall I ſing you a pretty ſong to divert you? Arabella had but to give a nod, and Peg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy immediately ſung to her all the little ſongs ſhe had learnt from the ſhepherds' boys in the neighborhood. And thus the time paſſed away, and Arabella hardly ever was tired.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="126" facs="unknown:026643_0131_0FD108E55FBE05B8"/>AT length, though by ſlow degrees, her health was perfectly re-eſtabliſhed. Her eyes again opened, her ſtrength returned, her complexion loſt its redneſs, and her appetite was reſtored.</p>
            <p>HER face, however, was ſtill marked with her late diſorder. But Peggy only looked at her with the greateſt pleaſure, from thinking of the danger ſhe had been in of loſing her. Nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther could Arabella, in return, ever ſee her without tenderneſs.</p>
            <p>HOW can I pay you as I wiſh to do, cried ſhe, for all that you have done for me? She then applied to her mama, to know in what manner ſhe could poſſibly reward her conſtant and faithful little nurſe. Mrs. Alliſon, who almoſt loſt her ſenſes with the exceſs of her joy, in ſeeing her beloved daughter reſtored to life, after ſo dangerous an illneſs, anſwered: Leave that to me; I will take care that ſhe ſhall be properly recompenſed for what we both owe to her diligence and fondneſs.</p>
            <p>SHE then gave orders to have a complete dreſs made for Peggy, including one thing of every ſort that ſhe could wear. Arabella undertook to equip her in it herſelf, the firſt day that ſhe ſhould be thought well enough to go again into the garden. This day proved a feſtival to the whole houſe. Not only Mrs. Alliſon, but all the domeſtics, were tranſported with joy to ſee Arabella again down ſtairs; while Arabella was equally delighted, from the pleaſure of having ſo uſeful a preſent for her good Peggy. Peggy herſelf was half crazy with her own happineſs, to meet again her little benefactreſs where ſhe
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:026643_0132_0FD108E6E71C8AF0"/>
had firſt known her, and to be dreſſed in new things from head to foot by her own hands.</p>

            <p>AS Mr. Courtney, in returning home from a morning-ride, paſſed along the walls of a church-yard in a little village, his ears were ſtruck with the ſound of a moſt piteous cry, which ſeemed to proceed from it.

               <p>Yes, they ſay ſhe is dead; but I don't believe them; for ſhe was quite well the other day, when ſhe left me at our neighbour Sarah's. She told me ſhe would come again, but ſhe has never come! My daddy is gone

               <speaker>Mr. Courtney.</speaker>

               <speaker>The Child.</speaker>
               <p>I am ſure I don't know; but whenever I want to run about with them, they puſh me away, and leave me all alone. And they ſay very bad things of my daddy and mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my; and that is what is worſe than all. O mammy, mammy! get up, get up!</p>
            </sp>
            <p>MR. Courtney's eyes were now filled with tears. You ſay, cried he, that your father and your little brother are both gone: Do you know to what place?</p>

               <speaker>The Child.</speaker>
               <p>I don't know where daddy is; but my little brother went yeſterday to another village. There came a gentleman all in black, like our parſon, that took him away with him.</p>

               <p>Well, then, I will lie down here, and ſleep by her ſide. O, I ſaw her when they put her in, that great box!—She was ſo pale! and ſo cold!—Oh my mammy! I will lie down here, and ſleep cloſe by you!</p>

            <p>JEMMY then began running before Mr. Courtney, as quick as his little feet would let him, till he came to the door of Sarah's cottage.</p>
            <p>SARAH was not a little ſurpriſed at ſeeing a gentleman enter her little hovel; while Jemmy, pointing to her with his finger, and then run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning to hide his face in her lap, called out: Here ſhe is! this is my other mammy!</p>
            <p>SHE could not tell what to think of ſo extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary a viſit: but Mr. Courtney left her not long in uncertainty. He deſcribed to her the ſituation in which he had found the little boy, told her with what compaſſion he had filled him, and begged her to give him all the information in her power, concerning the relations of the poor child.</p>
            <p>SARAH got a chair for him by her ſide, and beg<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n her account as follows.</p>
            <p>THE child's father is a ſhoe-maker, that lives next door: and an honeſt, ſober, hard-working man he is; quite young ſtill, and very well look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. His wife was a good pretty woman; but ſhe had a poor conſtitution, though ſhe was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duſtrious enough, and a very good houſe-wife.
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:026643_0135_0FD108EB4D04BBB0"/>
'Tis about ſeven years ago that they were mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried, and they lived very well together, and would have made the happieſt couple in the world, if they had but had a little more money. But John had nothing beſides his trade; and Margery was without father or mother, and carried nothing to her huſband, but a little mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney ſhe had ſaved, when ſhe was at ſervice at the good parſon's that belongs to a pariſh about nine miles off. This little money they ſpent in buy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a bed, and ſome crockery ware, and things for houſe-keeping, and a little ſtore of leather for their work. And, poor as they were, they found means to live pretty well, for the firſt years of their marriage, by good care and hard work. But, then came a family; that was the thing that firſt brought them into trouble. But, however, they would have got out of that dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulty, by doubling their diligence, if it had not been for other misfortunes. Poor Margery, who worked in the fields all day long in the ſummer, to get a little money to carry at night to her huſband, fell ſick with over work and was ill all the autumn, and all the winter and phyſick is very dear. Beſides that, buſineſs w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> on very badly, becauſe John's cuſtomers, by little and little, left him off, thinking they ſhould be but ill ſerved in a houſe where there was a woman always ſick. By and by, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, Margery got up again; but her huſband's buſineſs was ruined. They were forced to bor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row money to pay the doctor and apothecary. John had no more work to do, for he had loſt all his cuſtomers; and Margery could get little or nothing, becauſe her ſtrength was ſo gone,
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:026643_0136_0FD108ECD0A24918"/>
that no body would employ her. And, beſides all this, the rent of their houſe, and the intereſt they were obliged to pay for the money they h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>

               </gap>ves happy enough.</p>
            <p>(AT theſe words, little Jemmy ran into a corner, and began to cry.)</p>
            <p>BESIDES all this, their hard-hearted landlord, ſeeing they could not pay their winter's quarter, threatened John he would have him taken up. They begged and prayed him to have patience till harveſt-time, becauſe then they could get a little money, by working in the fields as day-labourers: but neither their begging nor their praying could melt him; for all he was richer than any body in all the village. It was a ſad trouble to them to make him agree to wait only for one month; and he ſaid, that if he was not paid every thing by the end of that, he would ſell all their goods, and put John in priſon. From that time forward, thoſe poor people were ſo ſad and ſorrowful, it would have melted a rock to have ſee<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> them. You may think, Sir, how it muſt move my heart, to hear my poor neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours bemoan themſelves ſo, and to have no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to help them with. I went once myſelf to their creditor, and begged him to have ſome pity on their misfortunes: and I offered to pawn to him all the things I was worth, for their ſakes. But it all anſwered no end. You are but a poor wretch yourſelf, ſays he, any more than they; and this comes of letting one's houſes to ſuch a ſet of vagabonds. Ah, Sir!

I took this hardneſs patiently, for fear of making him ſtill worſe; but I was ſadly afflicted to think I was only a poor widow, and could do nothing at all for ſuch honeſt people. What a deal of good the rich might do, if they had but the ſame good-will towards it that the poor have! But to come back to my poor neighbours. I ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſed Margery to go to the parſon, where ſhe had lived in ſervice ſo many years, with a good and fair character, and tell him her misfortunes, and pray him to lend her a little money. She told me ſhe would ſpeak of it to her huſband; but that it would be a hard matter to do it, for fear the parſon ſhould think they had fallen ſo low by their own bad behaviour. Three days ago ſhe brought me, according to cuſtom, her two children, and aſked me to keep them till night: ſhe ſaid ſhe would go to the next village, and ſee if ſhe could not get ſome hemp for ſpinning, in order to pay their debt. But ſhe could not pluck up courage to go to her old maſter the parſon; and ſo her huſband ſaid he would go in her ſtead; and he ſet out that ſame day. I was ready enough to take care of the children, becauſe I loved them dearly, for I had known them both from their births. Margery, when ſhe went away, kiſſed them and hugged them again and again, as if ſhe knew ſhe was ſeeing them for the laſt time. I think I ſee her ſtill! She had her eyes full of tears, and ſhe ſaid to the eldeſt: Don't you cry, Jemmy; I ſhall ſoon be back, and then I'll come and fetch you. Then ſhe held out her hand to me, thank<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me for letting her children ſtay with me, kiſſed them both again, and went away.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="133" facs="unknown:026643_0138_0FD108EFDB82FFD0"/>SOME time after, I heard a loud ſound in her houſe; but, as I thought ſhe was gone, I took it for granted it was nothing but a faggot of wood ſtanding looſe againſt the wall, that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to tumble down; and ſo I never minded it. Evening however came, and night came too, and ſtill I ſaw nothing of neighbour Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gery. So then I thought I would go to her houſe, to ſee whether ſhe was not gone there firſt, to put by her flax, before ſhe came to take home her children. The door was open; ſo I went in. O good Lord! how was I ſtruck, to ſee Margery lying down on the ground, at the foot of the ſtairs ſtiff-dead! I ſtood myſelf quite fixed, and as cold as a ſtone. I did not know what to do. At laſt, after trying to no end to lift her up, I ran to the ſurgeon, who came back with me, felt her pulſe, and ſhook his head, and then called a jury to ſit on her body. The jury and the ſurgeon together tried to find out how ſhe had been killed; and they ſaid ſhe muſt have died at once of the fall, or elſe, for want of help, have gone off in fainting-fits. Now I can tell well enough how it all happened. She had gone back to her houſe to get a bag from the garret to bring the hemp in, and her eyes being a little miſty with crying, ſhe did not ſee where ſhe had put her foot in coming down the garret-ſtairs, and ſo ſhe fell, head foremoſt, from top to bottom, upon the ſtone floor. This I know, becauſe of the bag's being at her ſide. But for all this, our juſtice had different thoughts: he gave orders to have the body buried the next day in a corner of the church-yard; and he ſaid he would ſearch far and near to find out what
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:026643_0139_0FD108F31A424E28"/>
was gone with John. I offered him to keep both the children myſelf; for, hard as I find it to live, I always ſay to myſelf: God knows I am but a poor widow; and ſo, if he gives theſe children to my care, he will ſee and help me to rear them. However, the little brother of him you ſee here, did not ſtay with me long; for it was but yeſterday, a few hours after Margery was buried, that the good parſon that ſhe had lived with, happened to call to ſee her. He knocked ſome time at the door; and, as nobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy opened it, he came up to my window, and aſked me what was gone with John, the poor ſhoe-maker, that lived at the next houſe. I told him, that if he would give himſelf the trouble to come in for a moment. I had a great many things to tell him about John, and about Margery too. So he came in, and ſat down juſt where you do. I told him all that had hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened; and it brought the tears into his eyes. And then I told him that John had thought of begging a little help of him in his difficulties. He looked quite amazed, and told me he had not ſo much as ſeen John. The two children came up to him: and he played with them a good while; and Jemmy aſked him if he could not wake his mammy for him, for ſhe had be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n aſleep a long while. The good parſon had the tears in his eyes again, when he heard the poor child talk ſo; and he ſaid to me: Good woman, I ſhall ſend to-morrow for both theſe little boys, and I will keep them at my houſe. If their father comes back again, and ſhould be in a way to bring them up himſelf, he ſhall have them whenever he deſires. But in the mean time, I
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:026643_0140_0FD108F63235D220"/>
will take care myſelf to have them educated. I can't ſay I liked much to hear this. I love the little ſouls like a mother, and it would have coſt me very dear to loſe them ſo ſoon. So I ſaid: Sir, I don't know how to bring myſelf to part from theſe children; I am ſo uſed to them, and they are ſo uſed to me.—Well, then, good wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, ſays he, you ſhall let me have one, and I'll leave you the other, as I ſee he will be ſo well off with you. And I will ſend you from time to time, ſomething to help to keep him. So I could not refuſe that much to the good par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>n. So then he aſked Jemmy if he ſhould not like to go with him? What there, where mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my is? ſays Jemmy. O yes, that I ſhall! No, my little dear, ſays he, it is not there; 'tis to my pretty houſe, and pretty garden.— No, no, no, ſays Jemmy, I'll ſtay here with Sarah; and I can go every day to look for mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my, and I like that better than your pretty houſe and garden. The good parſon would not peſter the poor child any more, for he had run to hide himſelf up in the curtains of my bed. So he ſaid he would ſend his man for the youngeſt of them, who would have been more a trouble to me than the eldeſt; and he left me ſome money to help on with Jemmy. So, Sir, this is all I have to tell you of Jemmy's relations.—But what makes me moſt ſorry now, is, that John never ſhould come home again; and that the folks have ſet it a going, that he is gone among a parcel of ſmugglers, and that his wife killed herſelf for concern at it. Theſe fibs have run about ſo in the village, that the very babies have them in their mouths; and when my little
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:026643_0141_0FD108F9386F4400"/>
Jemmy goes among them, they puſh him away, and all try to beat him. The poor child is ſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unhappy with it all; and ſo he never cares to go out now, but only juſt to his mammy's grave.</p>
            <p>MR. Courtney had heard in ſilence, but with the utmoſt compaſſion, the ſimple narration of Sarah. Jemmy had again returned to her; he looked at her with fondneſs, and called her from time to time, his mammy.</p>
            <p>GOOD, worthy woman, ſaid Mr. Courtney at laſt, you have indeed behaved moſt generouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly towards this unhappy family; and God will ſurely bleſs you for it.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Sarah.</speaker>
               <p>I have only done my duty; for what are we put here for, but to help one another? I think, for my part, I can do nothing more agreeable to God's commands, in return for all the good things he has given me, than to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort, as well as I can, all my poor neighbours. If I could but have done ſomething better for them! But I have nothing on earth but my cottage, and a little garden where I grow herbs, and what money I can earn by the labour of my own hands. But for all that, for theſe eight years that I have been a poor widow, God has always enabled me to live pretty comfortably: and I have good hope he will ſupport me the ſame for all the reſt of my time.</p>

               <p>Why, Sir, in the firſt place, I ſhould but yearn after the place where I was born, and where I have lived ſo many years; and in the next place, I ſhould not know what to do in the hurry and buſtle of a great houſe, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſo many people.

I have no child, and ſo Jemmy is the ſame to me as if he was my own; and the little I have got ſhall all go to him, when it pleaſes God to call me to himſelf.</p>

               <p>Be it ſo, then; I would not have my good offices for him occaſion you any uneaſineſs. I will leave you the child, ſince you do ſo well together. Talk to him about me often, and make him underſtand that I ſhall ſupply the place of a father to him, at the ſame time that you take upon yourſelf both the nam<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </sp>
            <p>SARAH lifted up her eyes towards heaven, while ſhe kiſſed the ſkirt of Mr. Courtney's coat; and then, calling to the child: Come, Jemmy, ſhe cried, come and make a bow to the good gentleman, for he ſays he will be a father to you.</p>
            <p>JEMMY made his bow; but, turning to Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rah, ſaid: How can he be my daddy? he has no apron on.</p>
            <p>MR. Courtney ſmiled at this childiſh inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence, and, throwing a purſe upon the table, ſaid: God bleſs you, moſt worthy woman! good-bye to you, my little Jemmy; it ſhall not be long before you ſee me again. He then went where he had left his horſe, and rode immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately to the pariſh of the good clergyman, who had taken the younger orphan.</p>
            <p>HE found him employed in reading a letter, which was wetted with his tears. After their firſt ſalutations, Mr. Courtney acquainted him with the ſubject of his viſit, and begged to know if he had procured any intelligence of what had become of the father of the two poor little boys.</p>
            <p>I have juſt now, Sir, anſwered the clergyman, received from him this letter, which he had written to his wife. He directed it to me, with this little ſum of money, deſiring me to forward them both to the poor woman, and to try to conſole her for his abſence. But, as ſhe is dead, I opened it myſelf. Here it is, Sir; will you have the goodneſs to read it? Mr. Courtney eagerly took it, and read what follows.</p>

                  <p>"I am very ſorry to think what trouble you muſt have been in at my abſence: but I muſt tell you how it all happened. As I was upon the road to go to the worthy clergyman, y<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ur late maſter, this thought came into my head: What good, thinks I, will come to me by turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing beggar? it's only getting out of one debt, to get into another; and then I ſhall never be at reſt for thinking how I ſhall pay it. At my age, to go and aſk for money, when I am able to work for it, is a ſhame. They'll only think me either lazy or extravagant. The worthy parſon married us himſelf, and he looks upon us as his children: but ſuppoſe he ſhould refuſe me out of ſcorn; or elſe that it ſhould not be in his power to help us? Beſides, ſuppoſing he would lend me the money for a whole year, how do I know if I could pay him at the end? and if I did not, how am I any better than a robber? I ſhall have impoſed upon him. So this was what I ſaid to myſelf about it, my dear Margery; and then I began to think how I could get us both out of theſe difficu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ties, in an honeſt way. But I did not know what to do; and I was very mournful, and ſadly at a loſs; when all at once it came into my mind: thinks I, Why, I am ſtill but young, and I am tall and ſtrong; what harm would it do me to turn ſoldier for a few years? I can write and read, and caſt accounts prettily enough: and then I may make my own fortune, and my wife's and children's beſide; or, at leaſt, I can get free of my debts. So if once I am but fixed, why, as ſoon as I get any thing, I can ſend it
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:026643_0146_0FD10902368DC648"/>
to poor Margery. So I turned all theſe tho'ts in my mind for about half an hour, and then I happened to ſee, juſt behind me, a couple of ſoldiers. They ſoon joined me, and aſked me where I came from, and where I was going to, and whether I ſhould like to ſerve the King? I made them believe, at firſt, that I had no mind to their buſineſs: and they preſſed me a good deal, and promiſed me the good round ſum of ſix pound ten; ſo I told them, that, up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on that condition, I would bind myſelf to them for ſix years. Done! ſays they, ſo come along with us, and the affair ſhall be ſettled at once. Then they took me before an officer, and had me meaſured; and aſked if I could read and write, and caſt accounts; and when I ſaid Yes, they ſoon made them give me the money. And ſo, as you ſee, my dear Margery, I am now turned a ſoldier, on purpoſe to get us clear of our difficulties. I ſend you the ſix pound ten, for I would not keep a penny out of it for my<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. Pay off at once the four pound five that I owe, and the ſix ſhillings intereſt; and with the reſt, do the beſt you can for keeping houſe. Nurſe yourſelf well, that you may get back your ſtrength; and buy clothes for the children, and ſend them to ſchool. I know you are care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and induſtrious, and will make the moſt you can of every thing. My pay will be four-pence a day; and I ſhall try to ſave one or two out of it, every day, to ſend to you at the end of the month: and in a little while, I ſhall aſk leave of abſence, that I may go and ſee you, my dear Margery. So don't afflict yourſelf; but truſt in God, for ſix years will ſoon paſs away. I
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:026643_0147_0FD109054A26B588"/>
ſhall then come and live with you again, and we will keep houſe together as we uſed to do.</p>
                  <p>"BRING up our children well, and make them ſtay within doors, and teach them to love work. Say your prayers with them every day, and tell them how to do their duty, and grow up honeſtly. You are able enough to ſhew them what is right. So live in the fear of the Lord, and pray to him for me, and I will pray to him for you. Send me an anſwer directly; you need only give your letter to the parſon, and I ſhall know how to get it. Kiſs both the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren for me. Tell Jemmy, that if he is very good, I will bring him ſome pretty things when I come home. So praiſe God for all things, and love me as long as you live; and I am your loving huſband,</p>

            <p>MR. Courtney could not read this letter without tears. When he had finiſhed it, Ah! cried he, how good a huſband, how good a fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and how honeſt a man! What pleaſure can be greater than ſerving ſuch worthy people? I will go and buy off the ſix years for John. I will pay his debts, and I will enable him to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin his trade again with eaſe and comfort. The ſix pound ten ſhillings ſhall be reſerved for the children. It has been but too dearly earned by their father! It ſhall be divided between them when they are old enough to go into ſome buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. Keep the whole ſum in your hands for them, and ſpeak to them of it from time to time, as the moſt lively and tender token of their father's regard for them. I will pay you intereſt for it myſelf, which you ſhall add to
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:026643_0148_0FD1090887BC2210"/>
their little capital. I cannot but have ſome ſhare in this moſt pitiable tranſaction.</p>
            <p>THE worthy clergyman was too much mov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be able to make any anſwer. Mr. Court<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney well underſtood the cauſe and feeling of his ſilence, and having bid him adieu, preſſed his hand and left him.</p>
            <p>ALL his ſchemes in favour of John, have ſince been put in execution: and John, reſtored to repoſe and quiet, now enjoys comfort and peace, ſuch as he had never before taſted, and ſuch as, but for the loſs of Margery, would make him the happieſt of men. His only con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolation for that, is in continually talking of her, with the faithful Sarah. The good woman looks upon herſelf as his ſiſter, and as the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of his children. Little Jemmy has not yet ſuffered one day to paſs, without again viſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the grave of his mammy: but he has made ſuch good uſe of the opportunity which Mr. Courtney has given him for improvement, that the moſt advantageous plan for his future wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, is already formed by that benevolent gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman. He has alſo taken care that the ſame attention ſhall be paid to his younger brother: nor has he ever, from that time to this, moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted his horſe, without recalling to his mind this touching adventure: and whenever he is him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf tormented by diſtreſs or misfortune, he haſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tens to viſit thoſe whom his own generoſity has made happy, and never fails to return to his family lightened of all his ſorrows.</p>

            <head>THE MASONS ON THE LADDER.</head>
            <p>AS Mr. Durand was walking out one day, with his little ſon Ambroſe, through ſome of the public ſtreets, they ſtopped to look at a houſe which was building, and already raiſed to the ſecond ſtory.</p>
            <p>AMBROSE obſerved ſeveral workmen ſtanding one above another upon the ſteps of a high lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der, who were ſucceſſively lifting up, and letting fall down, their arms. This ſight raiſed his cu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rioſity. Papa, cried he, what game are theſe men playing at? Let us go nearer the foot of the ladder, and ſee.</p>
            <p>THEY now put themſelves in a place where they could make their remarks without any dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger. They then perceived a man, who, from a large pile of ſtones, took out one, which he carried to another man, who ſtood upon the firſt ſtep of the ladder; and who, lifting it up with both his hands above his head, gave it to a third, who ſtood ſtill higher, and who, in the ſame manner, paſſed it on to a fourth. And thus, from one to another, the ſtone at length arrived at the top of the ſcaffolding, where the maſons were in readineſs to go to work with it.</p>
            <p>WHAT do you think of all this? ſaid Mr. Durand to his ſon; can you tell why ſuch a number of people ſhould be employed in build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this one houſe? Should you think it better to
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:026643_0150_0FD1091016B24D80"/>
have one workman go on with it alone, and ſo to let every man build a houſe by himſelf?</p>
            <p>YES, indeed, I ſhould, replied Ambroſe; for there would then be a great many more houſes than there are now.</p>
            <p>DO you conſider well what you are ſaying? cried Mr. Durand: do you know how many different trades and arts belong to the building of a houſe; that, if one man alone ſhould un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake it, he muſt be well acquainted with them all; and that he might paſs his whole life in acquiring ſuch variety of knowledge, before he would know enough of the matter to ſet about any building at all?</p>
            <p>AND even ſuppoſing him able to learn, in a ſhort time, all he ſhould know for that purpoſe; how ſlowly muſt he proceed, if wholly without help; firſt, in digging the earth in order to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare the foundation; then in collecting, and bringing to the ſpot, the ſtones or bricks for the ſtructure; then in ſhaping them; in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring the mortar, plaſter, and lime, and what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever elſe is required in the buſineſs of a maſon! Imagine him, however, now here, and in full ſpirits, ſettling his dimenſions, raiſing his lad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, and running up his ſcaffoldings;—in what time do you think, all alone, he could build his houſe to the roof?</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Ambroſe.</speaker>
               <p>Why indeed; papa, I am afraid he would never be able to finiſh it quite, without a little help.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Durand.</speaker>
               <p>I think not, indeed. And you may make the ſame obſervation upon all the works of a community, as upon the build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of this houſe. When any man takes a fancy
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:026643_0151_0FD1091186B715F0"/>
to retire from ſociety, and labour by himſelf; when, from the fear of being obliged to others for aſſiſtance, he refuſes to work with them; he waſtes both his ſtrength and his time in the attempt, and is always, in the end, compelled to abandon it. But where we mutually aid and help one another, we can perform, in a ſhort time, the moſt difficult and laborious things, and ſuch as, undertaken ſingly, might each re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the life of a man to execute.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>IT is the ſame alſo, with our amuſements and pleaſures. Thoſe who would enjoy them alone, and ſelfiſhly, muſt confine themſelves to a very ſmall number: but if every one would unite in contributing to the happineſs of others, each would be certain of an ample portion for himſelf.</p>
            <p>IN time, my dear Ambroſe, you will enter into the world: let the example, therefore, of theſe workmen, be ever preſent to your memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry. You ſee, from the mutual help which they give to one another, how much ſhorter and eaſier are the labours of all. We will come this way again in a few days, and we ſhall find, by their united induſtry, their houſe will be nearly finiſhed. Endeavour, then, always to aſſiſt others in their employments, if you wiſh to have them ready and willing to aſſiſt you in yours.</p>

            <head>PHILIPPA AND MAXIMILIAN.</head>
            <p>MRS. CARLTON was left a widow very young, with two children, named Philippa and Maximilian. Each of them alike merited her tenderneſs, though it was beſtowed upon them with the greateſt inequality. Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippa, notwithſtanding her youth, was very ſenſible of her mama's partiality in favour of her brother; but, however unhappy it ſometimes made her, ſhe concealed in her own litt<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>oſom, all the uneaſineſs which it cauſed her.</p>
            <p>HER face and figure, though not frightfully ugly, were by no means upon a par with her heart and underſtanding: while her brother was as beautiful as a little Cupid. Mrs. Car<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ton re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved for him all her fondneſs and careſſes; and even the ſervants of the houſe, in order to make their court to their miſtreſs, ſeemed to think of nothing but diverting him, and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plying with all his humours. Philippa, on the contrary, becauſe always checked and reproved by her mother, was certain of being treated ſtill worſe by the domeſtics. Far from ſtudying her inclinations, they did not even ſupply her with neceſſaries. When ſhe found herſelf quite
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:026643_0173_0FD1094B888EAC80"/>
alone, and thought herſelf deſerted and forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, ſhe ſometimes burſt into a flood of tears; but never, before any witneſſes, ſuffered the ſmalleſt complaint to eſcape her, or ſhewed the leaſt ſign of diſcontent. It was in vain ſhe ſtrove, by a conſtant application to all her taſks, by gentleneſs, and the moſt active deſire of obliging, to make amends in the ſight of her mother for what ſhe wanted in beauty: the qualities of the mind are loſt upon thoſe who accuſtom themſelves to value nothing but out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward appearances. Mrs. Carleton, little moved by the proofs of duty or regard ſhe received from Philippa, eſpecially ſince the death of her father, ſeemed never even to look at her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out reluctance. She reprimanded her perpetu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally; and required from her ſuch perfection, as ought not, with juſtice, to have been expected, even from an age and underſtanding far more advan<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ed.</p>
            <p>THIS unjuſt parent at length had a fit of ſickneſs. Maximilian appeared very truly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerned for her ſufferings; but Philippa, who in the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>guid looks and ſunk features of her ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma, fancied ſhe perceived an abatement of her uſual rigour, far exceeded her brother in her attentions and tenderneſs. She watched every turn of her eye, that ſhe might diſcover her wiſhes, and ſave her the trouble of ſpeaking them, by bringing of her own accord whatever ſhe thought it likely ſhe could want. She would not once quit her bed-ſide while there was any appearance of danger; and neither entreaties nor commands could prevail with her to take a moment's reſt.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="169" facs="unknown:026643_0174_0FD1094CF77C0E48"/>MRS. Carlton, however, at length recovered. This much-deſired reſtoration of health remov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed all the fears of Philippa; but her unhappineſs returned at the ſame time, when ſhe found her mother as harſh with her as ever.</p>
            <p>ONE day, when Mrs. Carlton was converſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with her children upon the miſery ſhe had ſuffered in her illneſs, and was thanking them both for the kindneſs with which they had nurſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and attended her; ſhe ſaid: My dear children, you may each of you aſk from me whatever you think will give you moſt pleaſure: and I will promiſe to grant it, be it what it may, ſo that it does not exceed the limits of my income. What ſhould you like, Maximilian? addreſſing herſelf firſt to her ſon. A watch and a ſword, mama, he anſwered.—You ſhall have them both to-morrow, as ſoon as you riſe. And you, Philippa, what will you have?—M<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>? mama, me? cried Philippa, trembling, O, I want nothing at all, if you do but love me.— That is no anſwer, child; I mean to give you, alſo, ſome recompence for your attention to me. What, therefore, ſhould you like? Sp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>, when I bid you. Philippa, though accuſtomed to this ſeverity, felt more than uſually hurt by it upon the preſent occaſion. She threw herſelf upon her knees before her mother's chair, and looked up to her with her eyes full of tears; then, hiding her face with both her hands, ſhe ſtammered out: Give to me, then, only two ſuch kiſſes as you gave my brother!</p>
            <p>MRS. Carlton, touched at heart by this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expected requeſt, felt awakened at that moment all thoſe ſentiments of affection for her daughter,
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:026643_0175_0FD1094E4A496858"/>
which hitherto had been ſtifled. She took her in her arms, preſſed her fondly to her boſom, and kiſſed her a thouſand times. Philippa, who now firſt received from her mother any marks of her kindneſs, gave herſelf wholly up to joy; kiſſing, in her tranſport, her eyes, her cheeks, her hair, her hands, and her gown. Maximil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian, who had never been able to help loving his ſiſter, joined in their mutual careſſes: and they all three enjoyed a happineſs which was not li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited to that ſhort inſtant. Mrs. Carlton, henceforward, beſtowed with intereſt upon Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lippa all the fondneſs ſhe had hitherto denied her; and Philippa returned it with ſtill increaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing attachment. Maximilian, far from being jealous, made his ſiſter's felicity a pleaſure to himſelf; and he found in a ſhort time the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward of this generoſity. The natural goodneſs of his diſpoſition had been ſomewhat injured by the weakneſs and blindneſs of his mother; and as he grew up, many little follies and errors eſcaped him, that might have weaned her love from him, had not Philippa always made it her ſtudy to excuſe him. The good advice which, from time to time, ſhe gave to him, brought him back into the right road; and they all three learnt this leſſon from their own experience: That there can be no happineſs in any family without the moſt perfect union between brothers and ſiſters, and the moſt equal and impartial tenderneſs to them from their parents.</p>

            <head>THE LAMB.</head>
            <p>LITTLE Phebe, a poor ſhepherd's daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, was ſitting one morning by the ſide of a great road, holding upon her lap a porringer of milk, into which ſhe was dipping ſome brown bread for her breakfaſt.</p>
            <p>DURING this little repaſt, a carrier came the ſame way, who was driving twenty live lambs to market, in a cart. Theſe poor little animals, heaped one upon another with their legs tied, and their heads drooping, filled the air with the moſt ſorrowful bleatings, which went to the very heart of Phebe, though the carrier heard them without pity. When he came up to her, he flung a poor little lamb before her, that he was carrying by the heels, upon his ſhoulder. There, child, cried he, there's a good-for-no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing beaſt for you, that has juſt died, to cheat me of a crown. Take it, if you will, and make yourſelf a feaſt with it.</p>
            <p>PHEBE immediately left off eating her break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faſt, and, putting the porringer and the bread on the ground, took the lamb in her arms, and looked at it with the utmoſt compaſſion.</p>
            <p>POOR little creature! cried ſhe; yet why ſhould I be ſorry for you? To-day, or to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morrow, they would only have taken a great knife, and cut your poor throat; and now, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of that, you have nothing more to go through. While ſhe was talking to it in this manner, the lamb, growing warm again in her
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:026643_0177_0FD10952D6764A38"/>
arms, began to open its eyes and move, and made a fain<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> bleating cry, as if pining for its dam.</p>
            <p>IT would be difficult to deſcribe the joy of Phebe at the ſound of its voice. She wrapped it up in her apron, then covered it over again with her fuſtian coat, and bent her neck almoſt down upon her knees to keep it warmer, breath<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, at the ſame time, with all her might, into its noſtrils. By little and little, ſhe felt the poor animal revive, and her own heart beat with joy every time it ſhewed any ſigns of life. En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged by this ſucceſs, ſhe rolled up ſome crumbs in her hands, put them into her por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ringer, and taking them out with her fingers, contrived, though not without much difficulty, to force them between its teeth, though they were ſhut very cloſe. The Lamb, who was only dying from want, felt itſelf a little ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened by this nouriſhment. She now began to ſtretch out her legs, and ſhake her head and her tail, and perk up her ears; and ſoon after, ſhe was ſo much better as to ſtand upon her feet; and then, ſeeing the porringer with Phebe's breakfaſt, ſhe went and drank out of it herſelf, to the great delight of the little girl. In ſhort, a quarter of an hour had hardly paſſed, before ſhe was ſo well recovered, as to cut a thouſand capers round her new little miſtreſs. Phebe, in a tranſport of joy, took her in her arms, and running with her into the cottage, ſhewed her to her mother. Little Baalam, as ſhe now called her, became from this time the object of all her cares. She always ſhared with her the bread and milk ſhe was allowed from her own
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:026643_0178_0FD1095444182FF0"/>
meals; and ſhe would not have parted with this one little lamb, for the largeſt flock of ſheep in the village. Baalam was ſo grateful for her kindneſs, that ſhe was never a ſtep diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant from her. She would eat out of her hand, and friſk perpetually round about her; and whenever Phebe was forced to go out without her, the moſt plaintive bleating ſpoke her ſorrow at the parting.</p>
            <p>THE pity and good-nature of Phebe, howe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, had ſtill a greater recompence. Baalam was ſoon the mother of ſeveral other little lambs, who, in their turn, grew the mother of more: ſo that, in a few years, Phebe had a very pretty flock of ſheep, entirely her own; which fed the family with their milk, and ſupplied them with clothes from their wool.</p>

            <head>THE VINE-STALK.</head>
            <p>IN the beginning of the ſpring, Mr. Sefton took a walk one day about his country houſe, with his ſon Jerry. The violets and primroſes were in full blow; and many of the trees were already budding forth their green leaves, while others were bright and gay with white or crim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon bloſſoms, that promiſed the fineſt fruits. They ſtrolled on till they came to an alley of lattice-work, at the foot of which was planted a vine, whoſe rough and crooked ſtem ſpread, without beauty or order, its brown and naked ſtalk all over the lattice. Papa, cried Jerry, do
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:026643_0179_0FD109565927A2E0"/>
you ſee this ugly tree, that looks as if it was ſtaring and making faces at us? Why ſhould not we tear it up, and give it the gardener to heat his oven?</p>
            <p>JERRY then began pulling at it as hard as he could, in order to force it up by the roots; but the roots were too deep in the earth for his ſtrength. Pray let it alone, cried Mr. Sefton; I will not have it removed. I ſhall tell you, in due time, my reaſons.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Jerry.</speaker>
               <p>But only look, papa, at thoſe beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful bloſſoms of the almond and peach trees! why ſhould not the vine be as pretty too, if it has a mind not to be pulled up? It ſpoils and deſtroys the whole look of every thing. Shall I go and tell the gardener to come and drag it away?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sefton.</speaker>
               <p>No, my dear, I would have it ſtay where it is, a little while longer.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>JERRY ſtill perſiſted in abuſing it: his father endeavoured to turn his attention upon other objects; and, at laſt, the unfortunate vine-ſtalk was forgotten.</p>
            <p>MR. Sefton's affairs, ſoon after, carried him to a town at ſome diſtance, where he was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained till the autumn.</p>
            <p>HIS firſt care then, was to viſit his country ſeat; and he again took his little ſon with him. The weather was extremely hot, and they ſought ſhelter from the rays of the ſun, by walking in the alley of lattice-work.</p>
            <p>AH, papa! cried Jerry, how beautiful is this green, and this ſhade! How glad I am you made them take away that naſty dry old wood that I was ſo vexed to ſee in the ſpring, and
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:026643_0180_0FD109580865FE70"/>
ſurpriſe me by putting in its place the moſt charming tree that ever I ſaw in my life! What delightful fruit it has! Only look at theſe fine grapes, ſome green, ſome purple, others almoſt black! There is not one ſingle tree in the whole garden that makes ſo good a figure as this. Almoſt all the reſt have loſt their fruit; but this, only look, papa, how it is covered! ſee what thick cluſters there are under all theſe large green leaves! I ſhould like to know whether they are as ſweet-taſted as they are pretty.</p>
            <p>MR. Sefton gave him one to make trial of. It was the muſcadine ſort. His tranſports were now increaſed; and ſtill more, when his father informed him, that it was from preſſing theſe grapes that the delightful juice was produced which he ſometimes had taſted at table, after dinner.</p>
            <p>I ſee, my dear, how you are ſurpriſed, ſaid Mr. Sefton; but your amazement will be yet greater, when I tell you that this is the very ſame tree, ſo dry, brown, twiſted, and ſprawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, which you ſo much ſcoffed at in the ſpring. Shall I now, then, call the gardener, and tell him to root it up, and heat his oven with it?</p>
            <p>O, not for the world, papa! I would rather have him root up every tree in the garden. That muſcadine is ſo good!</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Sefton.</speaker>
               <p>You ſee, then, Jerry, how well I did, not to follow your advice. What has happened to you, frequently happens in life. At ſight of an ill-dreſſed or ugly child, the richer and happier are but too apt to deſpiſe him; to grow proud by being compared with him, and even to have the cruelty to inſult and deride
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:026643_0181_0FD1095984B73EB0"/>
him. Be careful, my Jerry, of ever forming ſuch haſty judgments. Perhaps in that very outſide to which nature has been ſo unkind, there may reſide a ſoul, that one day may aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh the world by the greatneſs of its virtues, or inſtruct and benefit mankind by its extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry talents. The ſtalk may be rough, where the fruit is the fineſt and beſt flavoured.</p>

            <p>THE little Caroline, who has already been mentioned in the firſt volume, was one day playing about her mother, while ſhe was employed in writing letters. The hair<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſer being in waiting, Mrs. P. deſired him to go into the next room, and thin the child's hair.

            <p>WHAT may not in future be expected from a child who has given ſuch early proofs of the ingenuouſneſs of her mind, and the tenderneſs of her heart? May ſhe but more and more reſemble her admirable mother, and all that her moſt ardent friends can wiſh for her will be effected!</p>

            <head>THE FARMER.</head>
            <p>AS Mr. Dodwell was one day ſhut up in his library, where he was ſettling ſome affairs of importance, a ſervant came to tell him that farmer Mathews, one of his tenants, was at the ſtreet-door, and deſired to ſpeak with him. Mr. Dodwell gave orders that he ſhould be ſhewn into the anti-chamber, and deſired to wait there for a few minutes, while he finiſhed his buſineſs.</p>
            <p>ROGER, Alexander, and Sophy, three chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of Mr. Dodwell, were in the anti-chamber at the time farmer Mathews was car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried there. He made them the moſt reſpectful bow as he came into the room, though it was eaſy to diſcover he had never received any leſſons
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:026643_0183_0FD1095C84BA6F18"/>
from a dancing maſter. Neither was his lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, nor his manner of ſpeaking to them, at all more courtly.</p>
            <p>THE two little boys looked and ſmiled at one another, with an air of ridicule. They exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined the honeſt farmer from head to foot, with a diſdainful eye, whiſpered one another in the ear, and burſt out into ſuch ſhouts of laughter, that the poor man coloured, and knew not which way to turn himſelf.</p>
            <p>ROGER even carried his ill-breeding ſo far, as to hold his noſtrils, and call out to his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther: Alexander, Lord! what a ſtrong ſmell here is of dung! He then went for a chafing-diſh of hot coals, with which he walked up and down the chamber, burning paper and ſealing-wax, to take off, he ſaid, the bad odour. He next rung for one of the ſervants, and told him to bring a broom, and ſweep away the dirt that poor Mathews had made upon the floor with his ſhoes. Mean while, Alexander held his ſides with laughter at the impertinence of his brother.</p>
            <p>IT was not the ſame with their ſiſter Sophy. Far from imitating the rudeneſs of her brothers, ſhe reproved them for their want of civility, endeavoured to make excuſes to the farmer, and going up to him with a look of great ſweetneſs, ſhe aſked if he would have any wine to refreſh himſelf, made him ſit down, and took his hat and ſtick herſelf, and put them upon the table.</p>
            <p>AT this time Mr. Dodwell entered the room. He advanced with a friendly air to Mathews, took him by the hand, enquired after his wife and children, and what was the buſineſs which had <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>de him come to town.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="179" facs="unknown:026643_0184_0FD1095EC5EA38A0"/>I have brought you my quarter's rent, Sir, anſwered Mathews, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>rawing from his pocket a leather bag full of money. Don't be angry that I am two or three days behind my time; for the roads are ſo broken up, that I could not any ſooner carry my corn to market.</p>
            <p>I am not angry with you at all, anſwered Mr. Dodwell; I know you are a very honeſt man, and that there is no need to remind you of your debts.</p>
            <p>AND then he ordered a table to be brought forward, for the farmer to count his money upon.</p>
            <p>ROGER ſtared very hard at the ſight of Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thew's crowns and half-guineas, and looked at him now with a little leſs contempt.</p>
            <p>When Mr. Dodwell had examined the far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer's accounts, and praiſed his exactneſs, the good man produced a baſket of dried fruit, which he had baked: See, Sir, cried he, I have brought this for your young gentlefolks. Won't you let them come, ſome day, Sir, to take a little country air? I'll feaſt them the beſt I can, and try if I can't find them ſome amuſement. I have got very good horſes; and I can come for them myſelf, and bring them back at night in my chaiſe-cart. Mr. Dodwell promiſed he would himſelf go and ſee him, and begged him to ſtay to dinner. Mathews thanked him for his kind invitation, but excuſed himſelf from accepting it, becauſe he had ſome purchaſes to make in town, and was in great haſte to get back to his farm.</p>
            <p>MR. Dodwell had his baſket then filled with cakes to carry to his children, and tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ed him
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:026643_0185_0FD10962F6492010"/>
for the preſent he had brought to his own; and, after wiſhing him ſtrength for his hard labour, and health to ſupport his family, he ſaw him to the head of the ſtairs, and then bid him good-day.</p>
            <p>HE was no ſooner gone, than Sophy, before both her brothers, told her father how rudely they had behaved to honeſt Mathews upon his arrival.</p>
            <p>MR. Dodwell expreſſed much diſpleaſure at Roger and Alexander, and, at the ſame time, warmly praiſed Sophy for the difference of her conduct. I am glad to ſee, ſaid he, kiſſing her tenderly, that my dear Sophy ſo well knows what civility is due to all honeſt people.</p>
            <p>IT was now breakfaſt time; and he ordered the farmer's dried fruits to be brought upon the table, and eat part of them himſelf, with his daughter. They both found them very good. Roger and Alexander breakfaſted at the ſame time, but were neither of them invited to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take of the fruit. With their eyes, however, they devoured it all.</p>
            <p>MR. Dodwell pretended not to obſerve them; but again began a praiſe of Sophy, charging her never to deſpiſe any body on account of the plainneſs of their clothes: Becauſe, ſaid he, if we only are well-bred to thoſe who are finely dreſſed, it will ſeem as if our politeneſs was to the gown, or the coat, and not to the perſons who wear them. Thoſe who are the worſt dreſſed, are ſometimes the beſt people. Mathews is an example of this himſelf: he not only ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nages, by his induſtry, to maintain himſelf, and his wife, and his children; but, for theſe
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:026643_0186_0FD0F9C841542238"/>
four years that he has been my tenant, he has paid his rent with ſuch exactneſs, that I have never once had to call upon him for his money. You don't know, perhaps, my dear Sophy, that if this man were leſs honeſt, I could not myſelf ſupply all the expences of you and your brothers. It is he, in fact, who buys you clothes, and procures you a good education; for all that I receive from him, I reſerve entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly for your dreſs, and your different maſters.</p>
            <p>WHEN breakfaſt was over, Mr. Dodwell gave orders to have the reſt of the fruit locked up in a buffet. Roger and Alexander looked greedily after it; though they eaſily underſtood it was not preſerved for their ſakes.</p>
            <p>THEIR father confirmed this diſappointment to them. Expect not, he ſaid, to taſte, either to-day, or any other day, thoſe fruits. When the farmer, who brought them for you, has better reaſon to be ſatisfied with your behavi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our. he will not forget to ſend you more.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>But, papa, was it any fault of mine that he has ſuch a bad ſmell with him?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>
               <p>What ſmell?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>O, ſuch a ſtrong ſmell of dung, there was no bearing it!</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>
               <p>And where could he get that ſmell?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>Why, he is all day long working in the midſt of it in his fields.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>
               <p>What ſhould he do to prevent it, then?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>
               <p>Perhaps he ſhould never put any dung upon his lands?</p>

            <sp>
               <pb n="182" facs="unknown:026643_0187_0FD1096A103AE458"/>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>That would be the only way, papa.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>
               <p>But if he did not improve his lands by manuring them, how would he gather in a plentiful crop from them? and if he had a bad one, how would he manage to pay me rent for his farm?</p>
            </sp>
            <p>ROGER was going to anſwer; but his father gave him a look, in which both he and Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander read his diſpleaſure, and were ſilenced.</p>
            <p>THE following Monday, early in the morn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, the good Mathews was at Mr. Dodwell's door. He ſent up to him, to know if he ſhould like to come and take a turn about his farm. Mr. Dodwell, pleaſed with his civility, would not mortify him by a refuſal. Roger and Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander earneſtly begged to be admitted of the party, and made many promiſes to behave better.</p>
            <p>MR. Dodwell complied with their entreaties; and they jumped into the chaiſe-cart with much delight: and, as the farmer had excellent horſes, and drove well, they came to his houſe before they knew where they were</p>
            <p>WHAT could equal their happineſs when the carriage ſtopped! Mathews' wife came, with an air of the utmoſt ſatisfaction, to the door, gave them a joyful <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eception as ſhe opened it, took the children in her arms to help them out, kiſſed them cordially, and led them into the farm-yard.</p>
            <p>ALL her own children were already there in their beſt clothes. How do you do? and, You are very welcome, they all cried to their young gueſts, while they bowed and curtſied with the utmoſt reſpect. Mr. Dodwell wiſhed much to
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:026643_0188_0FD1096C6C9377F0"/>
talk a little with them, and careſs them; but dame Mathews entreated him to come in, for fear the coffee and rolls ſhould grow cold, which ſhe had got for their breakfaſt.</p>
            <p>IT was all ready, and upon a table covered over with the whiteſt cloth. It was not, indeed, ſerved in ſilver, nor even in china; but though the delft was ordinary, it was perfectly clean and neat.</p>
            <p>ROGER and Alexander looked ſlyly at each other, and would have ſhouted with laughter, but from fear of making their papa angry. Dame Mathews, however, ſaw by their grima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces what paſſed in their minds: ſhe made an excuſe, that her things were no better; and ſaid, that to be ſure they would have been help<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in finer diſhes at their own houſe, but that they muſt take in good part what was given them with a hearty welcome.</p>
            <p>BESIDE the rolls, they had ſome home<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>made cakes, which were ſo extremely good, that it was eaſy to diſcover the hoſpitable woman had exerted her utmoſt ſkill both in making and baking them.</p>
            <p>AFTER breakfaſt, Mathews begged Mr. Dod<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>well to give a look at his orchard and his grounds. Dame Mathews uſed her utmoſt endeavours to make this walk pleaſant to the children. She ſhewed them her flocks of ſheep, with which the meadows were covered, and picked out ſome of the prettieſt little lambs for them to play with. She next carried them to her pige<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on-houſe, where every thing was neat and clean. Upon the ground there were two young doves, that were juſt quitting their neſts, but not yet
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:026643_0189_0FD1096F4E24C210"/>
bold enough to venture to truſt to their own little fluttering wings. Some of the females were ſitting upon eggs in their ſmall houſes; and others were occupied by feeding their young, but juſt coming out of their ſhells.</p>
            <p>FROM the pigeon-houſe they went to the bee-hives. Dame Mathews took care not to let them come too near, yet placed them where they could plainly ſee the little creatures at work.</p>
            <p>AS the greateſt part of theſe things was quite new to them both, they appeared extremely en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained with them: and they were even beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging to look at them all a ſecond time, when Tommy, the farmer's youngeſt ſon, ran to tell them that dinner was waiting.</p>
            <p>IT was ſerved upon pewter diſhes, and it was helped in earthen plates: but Roger and Alex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ander were both put into ſuch good-humour by all they had been looking at in the morning, that they were aſhamed to give way any longer to their turn for ridicule. They found every thing nice and well dreſſed; for dame Mathews had done the beſt ſhe poſſibly could to regale them.</p>
            <p>WHILE they were eating fruit after dinner, Mr. Dodwell perceived two fiddles hanging up againſt the wall. Who have you that plays upon theſe inſtruments here? ſaid he. My eldeſt boy and myſelf, anſwered the farmer; and, without a word more, he made a ſign to his ſon to unhook the violins. They then took it in turn to play ſome little old ballads, now of a mournful caſt, and now gay and jolly, with ſuch readineſs, and ſo much deſire of obliging,
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:026643_0190_0FD10971B9281098"/>
that Mr. Dodwell both felt and expreſſed the utmoſt ſatisfaction at their performance.</p>
            <p>WHEN they were going to hang up the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruments again in their places, No, no, cried Mr. Dodwell, it is now your turns, Roger and Alexander, to try what you can do for our en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment. Come, play us ſome of your prettieſt tunes. In ſaying theſe words, he put the violins into their hands; but they knew not how even to hold the bow, and their aukward<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and confuſion raiſed a general laugh.</p>
            <p>MR. Dodwell then begged the farmer to or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der his horſes out, that they might return home. Mathews was very urgent in preſſing them to ſtay all night; but Mr. Dodwell could ſpare no more time, and therefore they took leave.</p>
            <p>WELL, Roger, ſaid Mr. Dodwell, in their way home, how do you find yourſelf after your little journey?</p>

               <p>O Roger, Roger! when this honeſt man came to our houſe, far from offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him the ſmalleſt refreſhment, you only laughed at him, and turned him into ridicule! Who, then, beſt underſtands good manners, you, or the farmer?</p>

But it is his duty to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive us well; he gets his living out of our eſtate.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>
               <p>And how?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>Why, by the harveſts from our fields, and the hay from our meadows.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>
               <p>True; but what does he do with the corn?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>He lives upon it; he, and his wife, and his children.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>
               <p>And what with the hay?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>He gives that to his horſes.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>He employs them in tilling the ground.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>
               <p>You ſee, therefore, that ſome part of what he takes from the ground, is turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, in the end, to its own benefit. But do you ſuppoſe he conſumes all it produces among his own family, and his horſes?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>No, the cows have their ſhare too.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Alexander.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, and the ſheep, and the pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geons, and the chickens.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>
               <p>Very true; but do his family, and his cattle together, conſume his whole crops?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>No; for I remember I heard him ſay once that he carried part of it to market to make money of it.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>Why, papa, laſt week, you know, he brought a leather bag quite full of it to you.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>
               <p>Who, then, at laſt, has the greater profit from the farm, Mathews, or your father? It is true, indeed, he feeds his horſes with the hay he makes out of my meadows; but thoſe horſes are employed in tilling the land, which, otherwiſe, would be over-run with weeds. He feeds, alſo, as you ſay, his ſheep and his cows with the ſame hay; but they ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply dung for the ground that lies fallow, which again makes it fertile. His wife and children, too, live upon the corn reaped in the harveſts; but they ſpend the ſummer in weeding that corn, and then threſhing it in the barns: and all this, in the concluſion, is my own advantage. The overplus of his crops, he carries to ſell at market; but is it not to pay me his rent, that he gets the money? And as to what may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, after I have received my dues, does he not well deſerve what his own induſtry procures him? Once more, then, tell me, who is it has the greateſt profit, he or I?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>Why—I ſee now it is you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>
               <p>And what profit ſhould I have without his labours?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>O, there are enough other farmers in the world!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>
               <p>True; but there are not any more valuable than this man. The tenant who rented this very farm of me before I let it to Mathews, cut down the trees, exhauſted the ſoil, and ſuffered the barns and out-houſes to run to ruin. When the quarter-days came, he was never ready with his money; and when I complained to him of his neglect, he repreſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:026643_0193_0FD1097CC3C2FB70"/>
to me that the whole farm was not able to produce enough to pay me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>O, what a rogue!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>
               <p>If Mathews was juſt ſuch another, do you think I ſhould make much of my eſtate?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>Why, no.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>
               <p>Whom, then, am I obliged to for what I get from it?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>Why, Sir, to this honeſt farmer.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>
               <p>Is it not then, our duty to behave well to a man who is ſo uſeful to us?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>Ah, papa! you make me quite aſham<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of myſelf!</p>
            </sp>
            <p>THEY were now for ſome minutes all ſilent: Mr. Dodwell then again renewed the converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>WHY would you not play upon the fiddle, Roger?</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>You know, papa, I was never taught.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>
               <p>Farmer Mathew's ſon, then, knows ſomething more than you do?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, papa; but he does not under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand Latin, as I do.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>
               <p>And do you, Roger, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand farming? can you follow the plough? can you tell how to ſow wheat, barley, oats, and all ſorts of grain? Do you know how they are cultivated? Can you even tell how to prune a vine, or raiſe a fruit-tree, ſo as to make it bear?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>I am no farmer; ſo I have no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion to know ſuch things as thoſe.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>
               <p>And if every body in the world knew nothing but Latin, how do you think we ſhould all live?</p>

               <pb n="189" facs="unknown:026643_0194_0FD1097F400DFA20"/>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>
               <p>Why, very ill; for we ſhould not know how to get bread, nor vegetables.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>
               <p>And do you think the world could go on, if not even one ſingle perſon in it knew any Latin?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Roger.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Dodwell.</speaker>
               <p>Remember, then, as long as you live, what you have juſt now heard and ſeen. This farmer, ſo coarſe in his dreſs, ſo aukward in his bow, ſo uncouth in his compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, this very farmer whom you ſo deſpiſed, is a man infinitely more polite than yourſelf, and knows many more things than you do, and theſe things all far more uſeful than any with which you can pretend to compare them. You ſee, therefore, now, the folly and injuſtice of holding any one in contempt for the plainneſs of his dreſs, or the want of poliſhed elegance in his manners.</p>

                  <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
                  <p>Your papa, Miſs Amelia, may be a little angry with ours, to be ſure; but certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly his requeſt was a little unfair. . . .</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Amelia.</speaker>
                  <p>Unfair? No, that it could not be. But if it was, I dare ſay I could ſoften him, in a little time. Tell me, however, what it is?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
                  <p>You know what a pretty thicket there is juſt at the back of your garden?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Amelia.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, very well. We always go there every evening in the ſpring, to hear the nightingales. 'Tis the prettieſt little wood!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, and you know, too, that this little wood was given to my father by old Mr. Drage, in return for the ſervices he had done him in his life-time.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <speaker>Amelia.</speaker>
                  <p>Well?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, Mr. Claremont wants now to have it.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Amelia.</speaker>
                  <p>What! my papa?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Thomas.</speaker>
                  <p>Our own wood?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
                  <p>My father told him he ſhould be ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry glad to oblige him, for he ſhould never forget what he owed him, both he and all his family; but that Mr. Drage had deſired him, upon his death-bed, never to give up that wood, but to keep it always for his ſake.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Amelia.</speaker>
                  <p>Well, indeed, with all my duty for papa, I can't but own I think him a little to blame in this affair. But, for all that, he did not want to have it for nothing<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that is not his way of thinking, I am ſure.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
                  <p>O no, indeed! he would willingly have paid my father for it, and perhaps have given even more than it was worth.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Thomas.</speaker>
                  <p>And what does he want to do with it? Has not he the ſame uſe of it that we have?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
                  <p>Why, he would cut down all thoſe fine trees.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>
                     <hi>Amelia</hi> and <hi>Thomas.</hi>
                  </speaker>
                  <p>Cut them all down?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
                  <p>You know the little hill behind the wood? He ſays he ſhall make that a point of view from his own garden. Now our wood is juſt at the foot of that hill; ſo to have that for the point of view, he muſt fell down the wood to the ground.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Amelia.</speaker>
                  <p>Ah, then, this is the reaſon he has ſent for that architect from town, who talks ſo to him of grottos, and bridges, and Chineſe temples! Papa thinks of nothing now but fine objects in a garden. He has always ſome new

plan in his hands. He gives me a deſcription of them a hundred times a day. And I uſed to be ſo delighted to think I ſhould ſoon ſee ſo many fine improvements! Ah! I don't wiſh for them now! I would rather a great deal your father ſhould keep his own little wood.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Thomas.</speaker>
                  <p>What would become of all the birds that uſed to warble ſo prettily upon thoſe old trees, and make their neſts there, becauſe nobo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy diſturbed nor frightened them away? And we uſed to carry them crumbs of bread.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
                  <p>And what ſhould we do for a cool ſhady walk, when the hot days come?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Amelia.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, and the echo, that uſed to ſing over again all the laſt words of our ſongs, upon the little hill?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
                  <p>And I'm ſure the ſight of a fine green wood is much prettier than of a hill.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Amelia.</speaker>
                  <p>And, beſides, what need has papa of any new points of view, when there are ſuch a number every where all round?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Thomas.</speaker>
                  <p>I ſhould think I had a limb cut off in every ſtroke of the ax.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Amelia.</speaker>
                  <p>No, no, your father muſt never give up his wood.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
                  <p>Muſt he not give it up? Ah! he will not keep it long!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Amelia.</speaker>
                  <p>And why not? Papa won't come and take it from him by force, I ſuppoſe? Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides, it won't be in his power.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Thomas.</speaker>
                  <p>But if he is ſo angry with us, as to forbid you to ſpeak to us, or to ſee us,—ah! I would ſooner give up ten woods than agree to that!</p>

                  <p>And I, too! what ſhall I do there without you, Miſs Amelia? O, I ſhall never want to go into the wood again.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Amelia.</speaker>
                  <p>Ah, my dear Jenny, how happy we uſed to be there! Do you remember how we went of a night, and told one another every thing that had happened all day?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes, and we uſed all to take our work there; and I uſed to knit, and you uſed to net; and then, when Tommy brought us flowers, we uſed to leave it all, and go about making up noſegays. And you uſed to give yours to me, and I uſed to give mine to you: and that uſed to make us remember one another all the next morning, till we uſed to meet again at night.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Thomas.</speaker>
                  <p>And all this is over now! and we ſhall never do ſo any more!</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Amelia.</speaker>
                  <p>And I ſhall never, never be happy again! I am ſure I ſhall fall ſick! and then my papa will be ſorry for me; and then I ſhall tell him, that if ever he would have me be well again, he muſt give me leave to ſee my dear little companions.</p>

                  <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
                  <p>But, mean while, the pretty wood will be all cut down! I know it will.</p>

                  <speaker>Amelia.</speaker>

               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Jenny.</speaker>
                  <p>Ah, Miſs Amelia, I have not told you all! About ten years ago Mr. Claremont lent my father twelve guineas to ſet him up here a little; and you know very well my father has never been in a way to pay it yet.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>

                  <p>If we keep our wood, Mr. Clare<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont ſays he will have his twelve guineas direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: and my father does not know where to get ſo much.

                  <speaker>Amelia.</speaker>
                  <p>Very well, I'll tell you then. You know—I am ſure I can never think of it with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out being ready to cry—You know how dearly my poor mama loved me: and when ſhe was in her laſt illneſs, one day that I happened to be alone with her, ſhe called me to her bed-ſide, and kiſſed me, with tears in her eyes, and tak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a purſe from behind her bolſter: "My dear Amelia, ſhe ſaid, take this; but be careful, I charge you, to let nobody know I have given it you. Keep this money by you for particular occaſions. You have a very good heart, and a very good underſtanding at your age; (my ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma was ſo kind as to ſay this) and ſo you will know very well how to make uſe of it in doing good. Your father is noble and generous in his diſpoſition; but he is alſo a little paſſionate and revengeful. You may yourſelf, if you at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:026643_0210_0FD109967249E2D8"/>
to what I ſay, be the means of ſparing him much uneaſineſs and regret. In ſo large an eſtate as ours, there muſt always be many poor tenants who ſuffer loſſes which they cannot help: and thoſe you may privately aſſiſt. You may alſo ſhew your gratitude for any ſervices or fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours you receive, without having always to apply to your father. It has been through your hands that, for theſe laſt three years, I have myſelf diſtributed all the money I have given away: I hope, therefore, you have ſufficient diſcernment to find out yourſelf thoſe that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve your kindneſs. I have, indeed, not any doubt but you will make a proper uſe of this little ſum, which I truſt to your diſpoſal for the benefit of the worthy poor. The good that you will do with it, I ſhall think done by myſelf; and it is the ſweeteſt method I can deviſe to make you keep me in your memory." And then ſhe could not ſay any more, for ſhe fainted away. But I ſhall never forget all this, if I live for ever and ever!</p>

                  <p>Indeed mama had always a great regard for them.

Don't ſay any thing againſt it, for I won't liſten to you. Stay but a moment for me, and I'll be here again. If I can but ſhut myſelf up alone, I will write a few lines to your father: but if I cannot contrive to come to you again, I will put the purſe under that great ſtone cloſe by the arbour.

                  <p>Why then, papa, I think that you are in the right, and that Dr. Goodwin is in the right too.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Claremont.</speaker>
                  <p>We are both in the right, are we? What a little flatterer? But this can't be; for one of us muſt be in the right, and the other in the wrong.</p>

                  <speaker>Amelia.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed, papa, I only ſay what I think. You have done Dr. Goodwin a great many ſervices, and you have a right to expect in return that he ſhould give up to you a thing you have ſo much ſet your heart upon. And, at the ſame time, he has a right to refuſe you, becauſe he has his own reaſons for not giving it up.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Claremont.</speaker>
                  <p>And are his reaſons good or bad?</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Amelia.</speaker>
                  <p>Indeed I am no judge of that. You look upon it as a matter of gratitude that he ſhould part with his little wood; and he looks upon it as a matter of gratitude that he ſhould keep it. You want to have it cut down, for the ſake of making a good point of view; and he wants to keep it up, for the ſake of a ſhady walk for his children. You are the richeſt man, and have the moſt power; he is already in your debt, and has nothing to ſet againſt you, but his entreaties, and the tears of his family.</p>

               <speaker>Mrs. Beaumont.</speaker>
               <p>I don't think it abſolutely neceſſary to tell you my reaſons: a little girl, ſuch as you, ſhould obey her parents, without allowing herſelf the liberty of aſking any queſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. But nevertheleſs, to ſhew you that I have always rational motives, both for what I order, and for what I forbid, I will, for this once, acquaint you what they are. Your cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſin Harry can only ſet you a bad example; and I fear, if you were to ſee him often, he might teach you to be as thoughtleſs and indiſcreet as himſelf.</p>

               <p>No anſwer, Aurelia! you know very well that I muſt always be obeyed.</p>

her mama was gone out, ſhe ſeated herſelf in a corner, and gave full vent to her ſorrow.</p>
            <p>AT this time, Nanny, a maid ſervant but lately hired, came into the room. Why, what's the matter, Miſs Aurelia? ſaid ſhe, are you crying? what is it for? won't you tell me who it is that vexes you ſo?</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aurelia.</speaker>
               <p>No, go, Nanny; you can do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to help me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nanny.</speaker>
               <p>And how can you tell that? When I lived with Miſs Sophy, ſhe was always ſure to come to me, whenever any thing was the matter. Ah, my dear Nanny, ſhe uſed to ſay<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> now you know what has happened to me, tell me what I ſhall do. And then I always uſed to give her ſome good advice.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aurelia.</speaker>
               <p>But I don't want your advice. I tell you again that you can do nothing at all for me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nanny.</speaker>
               <p>Well, at leaſt, then, let me go and ſee for your mama. She can give you ſome comfort, if I can't: and I don't like to ſee ſuch a pretty young lady fretting ſo.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aurelia.</speaker>
               <p>O yes, certainly, mama will give me great comfort!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nanny.</speaker>
               <p>Why, ſure it could not be ſhe that has vexed you ſo?</p>
            </sp>

            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nanny.</speaker>
               <p>Well, I ſhould never have thought it! I am ſure, ſo ſenſible as you are, there is nothing your mama need refuſe you. I am ſure, if I had a child of my own, as well be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved as you are, I ſhould let her do every thing ſhe had a mind. But your mama loves dearly to give orders; and, for the ſake of her

own maggots, ſhe will refuſe you the moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent things in the world. How can any bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy take a pleaſure in contradicting ſuch a ſweet child! You can't think how it grieves me to ſee you in ſuch trouble.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aurelia</speaker>
               <p>
                  <stage>(beginning to cry again.)</stage>
I dare ſay, Nanny, I ſhall die with grief!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nanny.</speaker>
               <p>So I am afraid, too. How red and ſwelled your eyes are! I am ſure it is very wrong of you, and very cruel, not to let the people that really love you, try to give you ſome comfort. If my little Miſs Sophy had only been half as unhappy, ſhe would have opened her whole heart to me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aurelia.</speaker>
               <p>But I muſt never open mine to you, Nanny!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nanny.</speaker>
               <p>It is not for my own ſake, I am ſure, that I want you to do it.—Perhaps it is becauſe your mama makes you ſtay here at home, when ſhe is gone out herſelf to take a walk.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aurelia.</speaker>
               <p>No, no; ſhe has promiſed me up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her word, that ſhe won't take a walk with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out me.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nanny.</speaker>
               <p>But what is it then? You ſeem to grow worſe and worſe. Shall I go and bring your little couſin to you? You ſhall play with him, to put you in ſpirits again.</p>
            </sp>

               <p>Nay, it will be no hard matter to get you that. A young lady ſhould not be left alone ſo. I ſuppoſe your mama does not want to make a nun of you?</p>

               <p>Forbid to ſee him! very pretty, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! Why, what has your mama got in her head? This is juſt exactly like Miſs Sophy's mama: ſhe took the very ſame maggot; ſhe would not permit her to ſee the leaſt in the world of little Billy. But we knew better than to mind her. O, how cunningly we uſed to cheat her!</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Nanny.</speaker>
               <p>Why, we always watched for the time of her making her viſits; and then Miſs Sophy uſed to go and ſee little Billy, or elſe lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Billy uſed to come and ſee Miſs Sophy.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Aurelia.</speaker>
               <p>And did not her mama find it out?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nanny.</speaker>
               <p>No; I always kept a look-out for them myſelf.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Aurelia.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Nanny.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhould only tell her you were play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the garden; or, if it ſhould happen to be a little late, I ſhould ſay you were gone to bed, and faſt aſleep: and then I ſhould run out ſlyly, and bring you home.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aurelia.</speaker>
               <p>Ah! if I thought mama would know nothing of it!—</p>

               <speaker>Nanny.</speaker>
               <p>Only truſt to me, and ſhe ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver diſcover it. Will you take my advice? Go and ſpend the evening with your couſin, and leave the reſt to my management.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aurelia.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhould like to try it for once. But then you will promiſe that mama—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nanny.</speaker>
               <p>Go, go; don't be afraid.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>AURELIA now gave way, and, with a little further encouragement, went to ſee her couſin.
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:026643_0234_0FD109D3C227F4C8"/>
Her mama returned home ſoon after, and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately enquired for her. Nanny anſwered that ſhe was tired of being alone, but had eat a very hearty ſupper, and was gone to bed.</p>
            <p>IN this manner, Aurelia deceived her unſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecting mother ſeveral times. Alas! thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs little girl! was it not rather herſelf that ſhe deceived by ſuch behaviour? Till now, ſhe had always been gay and happy; ſhe delighted in the preſence of her mama, and flew joyfully to meet her, if ſhe had been ſeparated from her even for a moment. Where, now, was this pleaſure fled? She was continually ſaying to herſelf: O! if mama was to know where I have been! She trembled even at the ſound of her voice. When ever ſhe ſaw her grave or uneaſy, O! thought ſhe, I am undone! Mama has diſcovered my diſobedience! Neither was this all her unhappineſs. The artful Nanny perpetually told her of the generoſity which had been ſhewn her by Miſs Sophy, how often ſhe had given her money and preſents, and with what confidence ſhe always had truſted her with the key of the tea-cheſt. Aurelia was all eager<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to deſerve from Nanny the ſame praiſe for generoſity and confidence that ſhe beſtowed upon Miſs Sophy. She took every opportunity of ſtealing tea and ſugar for her, of her mama; and ſhe even contrived to get for her the keys of the cellar and ſtore-room.</p>
            <p>SOMETIMES, however, ſhe liſtened to the reproaches of her conſcience. I am acting very ill, ſaid ſhe to herſelf; and all that I am doing may ſooner or later be diſcovered: and then I ſhall loſe all mama's love entirely! Frightened
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:026643_0235_0FD109D5479FF338"/>
at this thought, ſhe flew to Nanny, and warmly proteſted ſhe would give her nothing more. O, juſt as you pleaſe, Miſs, anſwered Nanny; but have a care! you may perhaps repent this! Your mama is coming,—and I ſhall let her know how well you have minded her orders.</p>
            <p>AURELIA could then only cry, and do every thing that Nanny was pleaſed to command. Formerly it was the place of Nanny to obey Aurelia; but now it became the place of Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia to obey Nanny. She was obliged to bear with all her inſolence and rudeneſs, and had not a creature to whom ſhe dared even complain.</p>
            <p>ONE day, this artful and wicked maid came to Aurelia, and ſaid, I have a great longing to taſte that tart that is locked up in the buffet; and I want a bottle of wine beſides. So you muſt go and look in your mama's drawers for the keys.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aurelia.</speaker>
               <p>But, my dear Nanny,—</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nanny<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </speaker>
               <p>O, none of your dear Nannys! on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly go and do what I aſk you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aurelia.</speaker>
               <p>But mama may ſee me; or, if ſhe ſhould not, God will, Nanny; and then he will puniſh us well!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Nanny.</speaker>
               <p>And did not he ſee you too, every time you went to your couſin? Yet I don't find that he has puniſhed you for it.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>AURELIA had received from her mother the moſt excellent leſſons of religion; ſhe was firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perſuaded that God has always his eyes upon his creatures, that he recompenſes our good actions, and only forbids our committing bad ones, becauſe they are really hurtful to ourſelves. It was from mere childiſh folly that ſhe made
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:026643_0236_0FD109D8A3225AB0"/>
her viſit to her couſin againſt the conſent of her mama. But it almoſt conſtantly comes to paſs, that when we are led into one error, we fall ſoon after into errors without end. She thought herſelf now compelled to do every thing that the maid directed, leſt ſhe ſhould be provoked, by a refuſal, to betray her. It may eaſily, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, be imagined how much ſhe had to bear from her.</p>
            <p>SHE one day ſhut herſelf up in her chamber, merely to have the liberty of crying at her eaſe. O good God! cried ſhe, ſobbing, what a ſad thing it is to diſobey you! Poor unhappy little girl that I am! I am become quite the ſlave of my maid! I can do no longer what is my du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, becauſe I muſt do every thing which that wicked woman bids me. I am obliged to be a ſtory-teller, and a thief, and a cheat! O take pity upon me, good God! and ſave and deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver me!</p>
            <p>SHE then hid her face, which was bathed in tears, with both her hands, and began earneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reflect upon what courſe ſhe could poſſibly take. At length, ſuddenly riſing, ſhe called out: Yes, I am now reſolved upon it; and even if mama were to baniſh me from her for a whole month, or even — But no, no, ſhe will not! ſhe will be ſoftened, I know, and ſhe will call me her dear Aurelia again. I can truſt to her goodneſs: but oh! what this taſk will coſt me! how ſhall I bear her looks and her an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger? No matter; I will go to her this mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and confeſs every thing.</p>
            <p>SHE then hurried out of her chamber, and ſeeing her mama walking alone in the garden,
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:026643_0237_0FD109DC039DC800"/>
ſhe flew up to her, threw herſelf into her arms, and, while ſhe embraced her, wetted her cheeks and her boſom with her tears: but ſhame and diſtreſs kept her from ſpeaking.</p>

               <p>Then am I a moſt unhappy mother indeed! to have ſuffered crimes and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juries ſuch as theſe from my own daughter! Leave me, unworthy girl! I muſt go myſelf to your father, and conſult with him upon what muſt be done with you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aurelia.</speaker>
               <p>No, mama, I cannot leave you! I know you muſt puniſh me; but only promiſe me that ſome time or other you will love me again!</p>

               <speaker>Mrs. Beaumont.</speaker>
               <p>Ah, miſerable child! you will indeed be puniſhed enough!</p>
            </sp>
            <p>MRS. Beaumont at theſe words walked away, and left Aurelia in utter deſpair upon a green bank on which ſhe had thrown herſelf: ſhe went inſtantly to her huſband; and they conſidered together upon what means muſt be uſed to ſave their child from ruin.</p>
            <p>SOON after, they went for Nanny; and, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reproached her with the utmoſt ſeverity and indignation, Mr. Beaumont ordered her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly to leave the houſe. It was in vain ſhe cried, and begged to be treated with leſs hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and in vain ſhe made a thouſand promiſes never to offend in the ſame manner for the fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Mr. Beaumont was reſolute. You know well, cried he, with what kindneſs I have be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haved to you, and with what patience I have borne with your faults. I hoped to have en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged you, by my indulgence, to have ſeconded my cares in the education of my child; inſtead of which, it is you yourſelf who have led her to theft and diſobedience. I look upon you as
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:026643_0239_0FD109E061EFCA38"/>
a monſter. Quit my ſight inſtantly, and think well of your own reformation, if you hope to ſave yourſelf from falling into the hands of a far more terrible Judge.</p>
            <p>AURELIA's turn was next. She came into the preſence of her parents in a ſtate that might well excite compaſſion. Her eyes were inflam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with crying, and all her features were ſwolen. Her cheeks were pale with terror, and her whole frame trembled as if ſhe had been in the ſhiver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it of an ague. Unable to utter a ſingle word, ſhe waited in mournful ſilence to hear the ſentence of her father.</p>
            <p>YOU have deceived, cried he, in a voice of ſeverity, you have deceived and you have of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended your parents. What could induce you to liſten to a worthleſs ſervant, in preference to a mother who ſo tenderly loves you, and who wiſhes nothing upon earth ſo much as your happineſs? Were I to puniſh you with all the indignation with which you have filled me, and to baniſh you for ever from my ſight, as I have done the accomplice of your fault, is there any body, do you think, who could accuſe me of injuſtice?</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Aurelia.</speaker>
               <p>No, papa, you can never be unjuſt to me: and if you puniſh me with all the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity that you can, I ſhall bear it all; but only begin firſt by taking me once more in your arms, and once more calling me your poor Aurelia!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Beaumont.</speaker>
               <p>No, I can by no means ſo ſoon forgive you. The confeſſion which you have made of your own accord, prevails with me not to baniſh you from my ſight; but I
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:026643_0240_0FD109E20DB5B460"/>
cannot call you again my child, and my Aure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lia, till you have merited my kindneſs by a long repentance. Attend well to your own be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haviour. Puniſhment always follows faults, and you will ſoon find yourſelf your own pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſher in having committed them.</p>
               <p>AURELIA did not well underſtand her papa's meaning in theſe laſt words. She expected yet greater ſeverity, and ſhe approached him almoſt broken-hearted; ſhe kiſſed his hands, and again promiſed the moſt perfect duty and ſubmiſſion for the future.</p>
               <p>SHE kept her word: but alas! the puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with which her father threatned her, ſoon followed. The worthleſs Nanny ſpread every where the moſt injurious reports. She related what had paſſed between them, with the addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of many frightful falſehoods. She declared that Aurelia, by ſervile and preſſing entreaties, and a thouſand preſents which ſhe ſtole from her father and mother, tried ſo continually to corrupt her, that ſhe had been at length pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailed upon to contrive ſecret meetings for her with her couſin Harry; that they ſaw one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, unknown to their parents, regularly every night, and that it was frequently extremely late before Aurelia returned home. And to this ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count ſhe added ſo many horrid circumſtances, that every body conceived the moſt diſadvanta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geous opinion of Aurelia.</p>
               <p>SHE was forced to bear, therefore, the moſt cruel mortifications. When ſhe went into the company of other little girls, ſhe ſaw them all whiſper one another, and look at her with an air of the utmoſt diſdain, or elſe with the moſt
<pb n="236" facs="unknown:026643_0241_0FD109E3908EE058"/>
inſulting ſmiles. If ſhe ſtayed later than uſual any where, they would ſay, "I ſuppoſe ſhe waits till the time comes for her meeting her couſin Harry!" If ſhe had a faſhionable ribbon, or any new ornaments, they would exclaim: "O, people who can get at their mama's keys, may very well contrive to buy new things!" And if ſhe had the moſt trifling diſpute with any of them, they would cry: "You had bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter hold your peace, Miſs Aurelia, for you think ſo much of your couſin Harry, that you don't know what you talk of."</p>
               <p>THESE reproaches were ſo many pointed needles to tear the heart of Aurelia. And fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, quite overpowered by her ſorrows, ſhe would throw herſelf, in an agony, into her mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's arms, and entreat pity and comfort from her.</p>
               <p>HER mother generally anſwered: You muſt ſuffer, Aurelia, with patience, the puniſhment which your errors have drawn upon you; and you muſt pray to Heaven to pardon your faults, and to ſhorten the time of your correction. Theſe trials may mend you for all the reſt of your life, if you attend to them properly. God has commanded all children to honour their father and their mother, and to ſubmit in every thing to their orders. This command is for their own happineſs. Poor little things! they know nothing of the world themſelves; they cannot foreſee the conſequences of their own actions: God, therefore, has put the care of you into the hands of your parents, who love you as they love themſelves, and who have experience and reflection to enable them to ſave you from
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:026643_0242_0FD109E54D0E4130"/>
the dangers which every way ſurround you. This, however, you did not chuſe to believe: and now you find, with but too much affliction, the wiſdom of God in his commands, ſince your diſobedience to them has coſt you ſo dear. Ah! my Aurelia, may your ſuffering at leaſt be your improvement! Every command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God is equally wiſe: he ordains no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is not for our advantage; he forbids nothing that would not do us injury. It is our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, therefore, that we hurt, every time we commit any evil. You may often find yourſelf in ſituations where you cannot, at firſt, perceive either how vice may harm, or virtue ſerve you. Always, at theſe times, call back to your mind your own ſufferings from one ſingle failure in duty, and regulate every action of your life by this infallible maxim:
<q>
                     <l>"Whatever is contrary to virtue,</l>
                     <l>"is contrary to happineſs."</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
            </sp>
            <p>AURELIA now followed with ſtrictneſs all the advice of her mother: and the more ſhe had to ſuffer from the errors of her conduct, the more attentive ſhe became to all ſhe ſaid or did. And, in the end, from the manner in which ſhe bore this diſgrace, ſhe not only ſilenced all her cenſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rers, but even acquired the glorious name of the faultleſs Aurelia.</p>

               <p>I was once rich enough not to fear becoming a weight to any body: but I lent my money to a gentleman who called himſelf my friend, and who lived a gay and thoughtleſs life with the help of it, till he ſaw me reduced to want.

               <p>I have always as much plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure in hearing the truth, as you can have in telling it; and even if it were to ſpeak againſt myſelf, I would not have it diſguiſed.</p>

               <p>I ſhould have been wiſer to have worked on 'till I died. But I was grown feeble and helpleſs, and I looked upon that as a ſign from God that I might now reſt from la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour. 'Till then, I had never flown from it; it had kept me in health all my young time, and I had never any other phyſician. But that which ſtrengthens one in youth, wears one out in age. I thought, therefore, I would work no longer. Yet, when I had loſt all my money, I wanted to try at it again; and I ſtruggled with all my heart to do as I had done before: but no!— when I came to make uſe of my arms, I ſeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as if I had loſt them!—Forgive me, Sir, theſe few tears in calling it back to my mind; but I never had a moment of ſo much unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs in my life, as when I firſt found that I was ſo weak, and ſo broken, that I could do no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for my own living.</p>

            <head>THE PLEASURES AND ADVANTAGES OF SOCIABILITY.</head>
            <p>HAROLD had received from Nature a melancholy diſpoſition, with a penetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting underſtanding. When he walked out with his uncle, every thing that he ſaw, awakened ſome reflection, and gave riſe to new thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs. His couſins frequently complained, that while he ſeemed himſelf ſo much engaged, he took no trouble in contributing to the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral amuſement of the houſe. They even re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolved, among themſelves, to beg that their fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther would not let him walk out with them any more: but a gentler method of correcting him, came afterwards into their minds. They agreed together to practiſe, for ſome days, the very ſame conduct towards him, that he practiſed towards others. One of them went to ſee ſome fine pictures; another, ſome new buildings; and a third, a collection of natural curioſities: but when they returned home, they kept to themſelves all the accounts, which they had formerly been eager to relate, of what they had ſeen or heard; and inſtead of that mutual com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication of the pleaſures of the day, which had made their evenings lively and agreeable, they had nothing now in common, but formal gravity, and a tireſome ſilence. Harold remarked
<pb n="245" facs="unknown:026643_0250_0FD109FEACD927C8"/>
this change with equal ſurpriſe and vexation. He felt the want of that gaiety, and openneſs of converſation, which, though he rarely gave way to, made, in fact, all his entertainment. Accuſtomed, however, to reflection and conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, it taught him immediately the injuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of his own behaviour: and he ſoon became as communicative, as he had hitherto been re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. In giving way to that ſocial openneſs, with which Nature has gifted mankind for their mutual bleſſing, attachment, and union, his own heart firſt taſted the ſweets of friendſhip and benevolence; while the vigour and vivacity of his genius found freſh employment and ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction, from the information he gathered, in return for what he imparted.</p>

            <head>THE LITTLE PRATE-APACE.</head>
            <p>LEONORA was a little girl of quick parts and vivacity. At only ſix years old, ſhe could both work and handle her ſciſſars with much dexterity, and her mama's pincuſhions and huſwifes were all of her making. She could read, with eaſe and readineſs, any book that was put into her hand: ſhe could alſo write very prettily, and ſhe never put large letters in the middle of a word, nor ſcrawled all awry, from corner to corner of her paper. Neither were her ſtrokes ſo ſprawling, that five or ſix
<pb n="246" facs="unknown:026643_0251_0FD10A018D5E1E80"/>
words would fill a whole ſheet, from the top to the bottom; as I have known to be the caſe with ſome other little girls of the ſame age.</p>
            <p>HER papa and mama had as much reaſon to be pleaſed with her obedience, as her maſter had with her induſtry. She lived in the greateſt harmony with her ſiſters, behaved to all the ſervants with civility, and to her play-fellows with the utmoſt good-nature and deſire of obliging. The old friends of the family, and the ſtrangers who made a new acquaintance with it, ſeemed equally delighted with her man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners and accompliſhments.</p>
            <p>WHO could believe, that with ſuch qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, ſuch talents, ſuch good-breeding, ſhe who poſſeſſed them could be inſupportable? Such however was, unhappily, the misfortune of Leonora.</p>
            <p>ONE fault, though a ſingle one, of which ſhe was guilty, almoſt wholly deſtroyed the effect of all her acquirements: her troubleſome fondneſs of talking ſoon made every one forget the merit of her mind, and the goodneſs of her heart. The little Leonora was the greateſt <hi>prate-apace</hi> in the univerſe.</p>
            <p>IN the morning, for example, when ſhe took her work, ſhe would firſt begin with ſaying: Well, it is high time now to be a little buſy. What would mama ſay, if ſhe were to come and ſee me ſitting with my hands before me? O dear! what a monſtrous long piece I have got here to ſew! Well, thank Heaven, I am no ſluggard, ſo I ſhall ſoon contrive to ſee the end of it. Ah! here now the clock ſtrikes; one, two, three, four, five, ſix, ſeven, eight,
<pb n="247" facs="unknown:026643_0252_0FD10A0323BFE2D0"/>
nine:—Well, I have two hours yet before I need go to the harpſicord. One may do a good deal of work in two hours. I know mama will give me ſome ſweet-meats to reward me. O what pleaſure I ſhall have in eating them! I love nothing ſo much as ſweetmeats, though French plumbs are very good too. Papa gave me ſome the other day. But I think almonds and raiſins are beſt; or, at leaſt, better than any thing elſe, except ſweetmeats. Now, if Dolly would but come to day, I ſhould ſhew her my new trimming. She is a very good-natured girl, that Dolly, only ſhe loves talking too much —one can't get in a ſingle word for her. Why now where is my thimble? Siſter, have not you ſeen my thimble? I dare ſay Jenny has taken it away with her. That tireſome creature is always doing ſome miſchief. Who can work, now, without a thimble? The needle will be always running into one's finger. And then one's finger will be bleeding, and that will hurt one ſo! and dirty all one's work beſides. Jenny! Jenny! why where are you now? Do you know any thing of my thimble? No, here it is —all entangled in my thread.</p>
            <p>IN this manner, the little thing would chat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter inceſſantly all day long. When her father and mother were converſing together upon ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects of the utmoſt importance, ſhe would come with her idle prattle and interrupt their diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. At dinner ſhe was frequently only be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning her ſoup, when the reſt of the family had finiſhed their meal. She forgot both to drink and to eat, in her eagerneſs to be eternal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly talking.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="248" facs="unknown:026643_0253_0FD10A04D2C59290"/>HER father every day, and repeatedly, repri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded her for this fault: but both reproaches and remonſtrances were equally vain. Neither had correction any better effect.</p>
            <p>AS ſhe ſuffered nobody to be heard but her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, ſhe was frequently ſent up ſtairs alone into her own chamber, in order to be kept out of the way. At other times, they made her, du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring dinner, ſit at a little table by herſelf, as far off from the family as poſſible. Leonora was ſorry and aſhamed, but ſhe did not the more reform. She always found ſomething to ſay aloud to herſelf, when ſhe could ſeize upon no one elſe to hear her. Rather than be ſilent, ſhe would begin to prattle with her knife and fork.</p>
            <p>AND what did ſhe gain by perſevering in this troubleſome habit? Nothing, my little friends, as you will ſoon ſee, but mortification and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred. I will tell you, now, what ſhe was one day obliged to endure.</p>
            <p>HER father and mother were invited by a friend, to go and ſpend a few days in the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try. It was in the autumn; the weather was delightful; and there had never, in any ſeaſon, been a greater abundance of peaches, nectarines, apples, and pears.</p>
            <p>LEONORA had the fulleſt expectation of mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing one in this party. She was greatly ſurpri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, therefore, when her father bid her little ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Julia and Cecilia, prepare for the journey, and, at the ſame time, turning to her, told her ſhe muſt ſtay at home. She f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ew, all in tears, to her mother, and called out: O mama, what have I done to make papa in ſuch a paſſion with me?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="249" facs="unknown:026643_0254_0FD10A06E9FBC1C8"/>YOUR papa is not in a paſſion with you, an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered her mother; but there is no poſſibility of enduring you in any ſociety. You interrupt all our peace and comfort by your impertient prating.</p>
            <p>MUST I never ſpeak one word then? ſaid Leonora.</p>
            <p>THAT, anſwered her mother, would be near<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly as great a fault as this, of which we deſire to correct you. But you muſt always wait for your turn, and not perpetually interrupt your father and me, and people who are both older and wiſer than you can be. You ought, alſo, to break yourſelf of that idle and troubleſome trick of ſaying every thing that comes into your head. When you wiſh to aſk any queſtion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally for your inſtruction, you ſhould do it in few words, and at once: and when you have any little account to give, always conſider firſt in your own mind, whether your friends, or who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you are ſpeaking to, are likely to wiſh to hear it.</p>
            <p>LEONORA, however deficient ſhe might be in reaſons, would at leaſt have found abundance of words in her own juſtification, had ſhe not heard her papa's voice, calling aloud to her mother and ſiſters, that the carriage was waiting.</p>
            <p>LEONORA ſaw them ſet off, with many ſighs; and followed the carriage with her eyes, which were ſwimming in tears, as long as it was in ſight: and when ſhe could ſee it no more, ſhe went and ſeated herſelf in a corner, and ſpent the firſt quarter of an hour in nothing but cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. O wicked tongue! ſaid ſhe, it is to you I owe all my misfortunes! But I will take care
<pb n="250" facs="unknown:026643_0255_0FD10A0B665B4A48"/>
you ſhall never, never for the future, ſay one ſingle word more than you ought.</p>
            <p>IN a few days the family returned. Her ſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters brought home baſkets full of nuts and grapes; and, as they had excellent diſpoſitions, their firſt pleaſure was to beg Leonora to partake of their preſents: but Leonora was ſo loſt in melancholy, that ſhe would not even taſte them. She went up to her father, and ſaid to him: Ah! my dear papa, forgive me for making you puniſh me ſo; for I am ſure you have been as ſorry for it as myſelf: and ſo I think we have both been ſufferers; but indeed, indeed, papa, I will never be ſuch a prate-apace any more.</p>
            <p>HER father embraced her tenderly; and the next morning, ſhe was permitted to breakfaſt at table with the reſt of the family. She ſpoke very little, and all ſhe ſaid was modeſt and to the purpoſe. It is true, ſhe found it very diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cult, at firſt, to keep her tongue in ſuch order; for, unuſed to any control, it was continually in motion, rolling from ſide to ſide of her mouth. But the day after, this reſtraint grew leſs painful to her, and every following day ſtill leſs and leſs; till, by degrees, ſhe was able wholly to conquer her inſupportable love of chattering. And now ſhe perfectly underſtands how to bear her part in ſociety, without ever being impertinent, tireſome, or intruding.</p>

            <head>The STRAWBERRIES and CURRANTS.</head>
            <p>ARCHIBALD had often been told by his fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that children know little or nothing of what is fit for them, and that they can never grow wiſe but by following the counſel of thoſe who are older than themſelves. But this was a leſſon which he was unwilling to underſtand, or elſe, which he did not remember.</p>
            <p>A diviſion had been made of a little ſquare piece of ground in the garden, between his bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Percival and himſelf; and each had his own half at his entire diſpoſal, with full permiſſion to ſow or to plant in it whatever he pleaſed.</p>
            <p>PERCIVAL immediately recollected his father's inſtructions. He went, therefore, to the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener, and ſaid to him: Robert, be ſo good as to tell me what I can plant in my little garden, and how I muſt manage to make things grow in it.</p>
            <p>ROBERT gave him ſome roots, and picked him out ſome of his beſt ſeeds. Percival flew to put them in the earth: and Robert had the good-nature to over-look and to direct his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceedings.</p>
            <p>ARCHIBALD only ſhrugged his ſhoulders at the compliance of his brother. Should you like, ſaid the gardener, that I ſhould do ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing alſo for you?</p>
            <p>O, to be ſure, cried Archibald, I have great need of your advice!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="252" facs="unknown:026643_0257_0FD10A1072A0BD38"/>HE then went himſelf, and gathered ſome flowers, and planted them by the ſtalk in the ground; while Robert <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>THE next morning, Archibald went to viſit his flowers, and ſaw them all drooping, withered, faded, and bending down to the earth. He in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly, however, planted more; but he ſaw, the next day, that they had ſhared the ſame fate.</p>
            <p>HE ſoon grew weary of this work. It was paying rather too dear for the pleaſure of having flowers in his garden. He ceaſed, therefore, to take any further trouble with it, and the ground was quickly covered with thiſtles and weeds.</p>
            <p>ABOUT the latter end of the next ſpring, he perceived, upon his brother's ground, ſomething red, that ſeemed budding in the midſt of thick cluſters of green. He went to examine it; and found the fineſt ſtrawberries, beautiful in their colour, and delicious in their taſte. O dear! cried he, if I too had but planted ſome of theſe in my garden!</p>
            <p>NOT long after, he obſerved ſome little round things, of a deep vermillion, hanging in bunches between the leaves of a thick buſh. He inſtant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly went up to them. They were currants, ſo fine, ripe, and inviting, that only to look at them might create an appetite. Ah! cried he again, if I had but planted ſome of theſe, too, in my garden!</p>
            <p>YOU may eat of them, as if they were en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely yours, ſaid his brother.</p>
            <p>IT was all in your own power, ſaid the gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dener, to have had ſome equally good. So pray

                        <p>"Our dear Frederick has behaved very ill. Some days ago, he ſold his watch, and, what is worſe, the greater part of his claſſical books, as well as all his books of devotion. I will tell you how I came to know it. An old book-ſeller, who lets us have books at ſecond-hand, came the other day to offer me the Chriſtian's Exerciſe. As mine is almoſt worn out, by fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent reading, I was very glad of the opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity to buy another. He ſhewed it me. I in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly knew it to be Frederick's; and ſo much the more certainly, becauſe his name was ſcrawl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the title-page. I bought it for ſixpence; but I ſaid nothing, that I might not diſgrace him among our ſchool-fellows. So I only car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried it to our tutor, who ſent for the book-ſeller, and enquired of whom he had the book.</p>
                        <p>THE bookſeller confeſſed he had purchaſed it of my couſin. Frederick could not deny it, and ſaid he had ſold it becauſe he wanted ſome mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney; and that, in the mean time, till he could buy another, he had borrowed one of a friend who happened to have two.</p>
                        <p>

Frederick told him a long tale; but I ſuſpect it was a mere falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood. Now, thought I to myſelf, I ſhould like to find out if he has not alſo diſpoſed of ſome of his other things. And the firſt that came into my head was that watch which you gave him for a new-year's gift, that he might keep ſome account how he ſpent his time, which, as you may remember, he never much thought about. I aſked him, therefore, what it was o'clock? He looked confuſed, and anſwered, that his watch was at the watch-maker<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                              <desc>•</desc>
                           </gap>s. I then ran directly to the watch-maker's, to ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy myſelf. But there was not a word of truth in it. I then reaſoned to him about it, as one friend ſhould to another. He replied, that it was no buſineſs of mine, and that his watch was in a much better place where he had put it, than keeping it in his fob; and that he did not want to look at the hour to tell him what he had to do. So who knows what may have happened to him ſtill worſe? for there is no finding out every thing."</p>

                  <p>I have done it with the greateſt pleaſure; I have no merit in it at all. When your poor mother was alive, ſhe always acted the ſame, during my long voyages, by my own children. It was therefore my duty to return it. And I never in my life repented it till to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day; but . . . .</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Dolly.</speaker>
                  <p>O Sir! if my brother has forgot himſelf juſt for a moment, it is only from the haſtineſs of his diſpoſition. You know, uncle, you had him for a long time under your own eyes; and I am ſure you muſt remember, that whenever he did any thing that was not right, his repentance, and his ſorrow for having made you angry, were always greater than his fault.</p>
               </sp>
               <sp>
                  <speaker>Mr. Vincent.</speaker>
                  <p>Yes; and how many many fool's frolicks have I forgiven him! Did not he burn his eye-brows, and his hair, with his crackers? Did he not break a great looking-glaſs, by let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting it fall out of the window, at the next door? Did he not tumble himſelf into a ſlough, one day, when he had juſt put his beſt coat on? Did he not drive my handſome new chariot into a ditch? And did not I pardon him every thing? I thought all theſe miſchievous pranks were only owing to giddineſs, and not to a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition naturally bad: but to ſell his watch, and his books, to ſpend the whole night out of ſchool, and rebel againſt his maſters, and then
<pb n="260" facs="unknown:026643_0265_0FD10A28AAB6E7F0"/>
to have the aſſurance to think of coming back to my houſe!—</p>

                  <p>No, no, I have no fault to find with you: and the ill behaviour of your brother ſhall make no change in my regard for you.

                  <p>I thought ſo myſelf! We all love him dearly, God knows, and would give up our very lives to ſerve him. Whenever we did the leaſt thing in the world for him, he was ſure to make us amends. He was always rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy to ſpeak a good word for us, if his uncle was in anger; and he was the firſt to do good to all the poor people in the village. I can't think how his maſter can have the heart to be in a paſſion with him! But I know how it is; they want to puniſh him for ſome little comical frolick; and he has ſuch a fine ſpirit, that he ſcorns to bow down to them.</p>

                  <p>About ſeven miles off. He was faſt aſleep under a willow-tree, by the ſide of a little brook.</p>

                  <p>The meſſenger ſtayed by him till he waked. You may think how much Maſter Frederick was ſurpriſed at ſeeing him. He took it for granted the man was only following him to force him back again; and he told him he would ſooner be torn in pieces than go with him.</p>

                  <p>Why, though he was almoſt tired to death, he began walking on with him; and they travelled together till they came to the borders of the wood; and then Maſter Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick ran into it, and hid himſelf in the hermi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage.

<pb n="265" facs="unknown:026643_0270_0FD10A3648EE9730"/>
he commits all the faults himſelf, and then has the cunning to throw them upon other people. This is not the firſt time he has tried to ſet papa againſt Frederick. Often and often, by ſome ſecret complaints of him, he has had him ſent out of the houſe; and then afterwards, when every thing has come to light, it has been found that no body was to blame but himſelf. I can ſee clearly, even by this letter, that it is all ſome treachery of his own, and that Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick has only been a little unthinking and giddy.</p>

                  <p>I know well enough that Dol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and you have always owed him a grudge; and, by your management, I began to be pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judiced againſt him myſelf. But the ſchool-maſter has ſent me to-day ſo good an account of him—</p>
               </sp>

                  <speaker>Marianne.</speaker>
                  <p>O dear papa! and was he not always praiſed here in the ſame manner by his tutors? They know very well that he has a rich father; and ſo they always hope to get pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſents for themſelves, by flattering his ſon.</p>

                  <p>Well, well, perhaps they may ſometimes have cajoled me a little about him: but at leaſt, however, he has played me no tricks ſince his infancy, and Frederick has play<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me a thouſand.</p>

                  <speaker>Marianne.</speaker>

                  <speaker>Mr. Vincent.</speaker>
                  <p>You'll put me in a rage, girl! Did he hurt no creature but himſelf, when he drove my new chariot into the ditch, and beat it about till half the gilding came off; a chariot that coſt ſo much?</p>

                  <speaker>Marianne.</speaker>
                  <p>O, it was only a little unlucky frolick, papa, and very excuſable at his age. Peter was driving the chariot about, and Frede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick teazed him to take him upon the box; but when they had gone a little way together, the whip happened to drop. Peter got down to pick it up: the horſes felt a ſlack rein, and began running away; happily, however, the fore wheels came off, and ſo no harm was done, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept to the carriage.</p>

But every body was afraid of the major, though the major was afraid of nothing but death; and that felled him down, whether he would or no. And now I am quite out of employ, and can't tell where to lay my head.</p>

                  <p>O my dear young lady, it is not here the ſame thing as in a great city. In ſuch a village as this, and all here-abouts, the people are ſo poor, that they have more need of their oats for themſelves than for their horſes. So I hired myſelf out by the day to work in the fields; my wife was always at her ſpinning; and my children went about begging charity. But, all of us together, we got ſo little, that at the end of the week, we could not manage to pay for a little truckle-bed we hired in a garret: ſo, in a little time, we had nothing but the ſky to cover us, and the ground to lie upon! My poor wife, between ſickneſs and ſorrow, has breathed her laſt!

And when I uſed to be foaming with rage, like a madman, and ready to break every thing in the room, ſhe knew the way to bring me back to God, and make me an honeſt man again.

                  <p>He preſently knew my girl; and he got up from the table, in ſpite of all his compan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ion could ſay to hinder him. He gave the poor thing a glaſs of wine, and took her hand and came out with her, to make her tell him all that had happened to us. And then he bid her bring him to where I was. They found me in the next ſtreet, pumping ſome water into my hat, to refreſh myſelf a little, becauſe of the heat. I thought I ſhould have gone mad with joy, when I ſaw him. All dirty and ragged as I was, I took him in my arms before them all; and I believe they were afraid I ſhould have ſuffocated him, I hugged him ſo heartily. However, he hugged me as much again. But, at laſt, as a mob got about us, he told me to take him ſomewhere that we could be alone together; and ſo I took him to a garret which I had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpoke to ſleep in.</p>

                  <p>I told him all the ſame I have been telling your honour; and the good young gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman fell a crying, and took on mightily. It is I, ſaid he, ought to beg for you, for it was I that was the cauſe of your misfortune. How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, I won't go to ſleep till I have done ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for you. Here, poor Peter, take this; you ſhall have all that I have in my pockets; and then he felt in them, and emptied them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to my hands. At firſt I would not take it, and he was very angry. I told him I ſuppoſed it was only the money they had given him for his amuſements, and that, as to me, I was uſed enough to hardſhips. He quite gnaſhed his teeth, and ſtamped with his feet, and, I dare ſay, would have beaten me, at laſt, if I had not taken his purſe.</p>

                  <p>About ſix ſhillings. And he would only keep ſixpence of it. It ſhall never be ſaid, cried he, that an honeſt old ſervant of my uncle, that never robbed nor murdered, was obliged, in his old age, to go a begging, and had not ſo much as a roof to ſhelter him. Get yourſelf a room; and before three days are at an end, I will come to you again, and bring you enough to live upon, till I can write for more to my un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle.

                  <p>And what do you do with your chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren? ſaid he, while he was playing with my boy. What do I do with them? ſaid I; why, they run along the ſtreets and roads, carrying flowers, and little brooms, and the like, to ſell; and when nobody will buy any, they beg cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity. That's very bad for them, ſaid he; for at that rate they'll only grow up to idleneſs or roguery. You muſt make your boy learn ſome honeſt trade, and put your girl out to work with ſome honeſt people.</p>

                  <p>Very true, ſaid I; but how am I to offer them in all theſe rags? If I had only fifty ſhillings, or there-abouts, I ſhould know well enough how to diſpoſe of them. There is a weaver here who employs children, if I could only give him a guinea, or ſo, before-hand. And here is an herb-woman, too, who would as willingly take the girl, to ſell her flowers, and ſo forth, but I had only juſt enough to buy her a gown, or ſo. And then I might go and try to get into ſervice again myſelf, in ſome rich houſe, and not be forced to ſtroll about in this way like a vagabond.</p>

                  <p>Not a word, Sir, but went away: however, two days after, he came back again. Where is the weaver, ſaid he, that would take your ſon? Carry me to him directly. I then ſhewed him the way, and he went and talked to him in private. And now, ſaid he, where is the herb-woman? So then I ſhewed him the

way there too. He left me at the door, and went and talked to her in the garden, and then came back to me, without ſaying a word, and walked off with me. But when he had gone about a hundred ſteps, he ſtopp'd ſhort, and, catching hold of me, called out: Good old man, ſet your mind at reſt about your children. And then, after that, he bid me go to a ſlop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhop, that he pointed to me, a good way off; where he had paid for this ſurtout and coat that you ſee I have got on.—And I think, in my own mind, I look as great as a lord in them!</p>

I was quite poſitive to give it him back; but if ever I ſaw him fall into a paſſion, that was the time. He told me, Sir, that it was your honour that ſent it him, on purpoſe for me: but when I told him I would run here out of hand to thank you for it, he ſaid you would make believe you knew nothing about it.

                  <speaker>Peter.</speaker>
                  <p>I'll tell you, Miſs. They would not take my boy, after all, without a certificate of his birth: ſo I was obliged to come and aſk it of the parſon. And juſt as I got into the village, it ſeemed as if Maſter Frederick had brought good luck to me, for I was told that Mr. Boynton wanted a coachman. So I went, and offered myſelf to his ſervice, and he ſaid he had no objection to taking me, provided I could bring him a good character from my laſt maſter. Now I could not go into the other world to aſk one of the major; ſo I made bold to try if I might ſpeak to your honour. I don't know but you may judge proper to refuſe it me, but I ſhall always be glad to think I have had an opportunity to give you my humble thanks for the favours you was ſo good as to ſend me by Maſter Frederick.</p>

                  <p>No, my good Peter, you owe thoſe favours to nobody but him. And he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt ſtripp'd himſelf in order to clothe you. But then he owes you, in exchange, the return of my affection. From what a misfortune you have ſaved him! But for you, Peter,—yes, but for you, I ſhould have baniſhed him from my ſight for ever!</p>

               <p>PAPA, I can tell you of a very good ſervant when you turn away old John.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bellamy.</speaker>
               <p>And who commiſſioned you to take any ſuch trouble? Why ſhould you think I intend to turn him away?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
               <p>What, papa, ſhall you always keep that old fellow? I am ſure a younger man would do much better for us.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bellamy.</speaker>
               <p>How now, Peregrine! This is a bad reaſon for diſcharging an old ſervant. An old fellow, you call him; O Peregrine! you ought to be aſhamed of yourſelf. Is it not in my ſervice that he is grown old? is it not even very probable that his attendance upon you in your childhood, and the concern and anxiety which he felt for your frequent illneſſes, have made him grow old before his time? How unreaſonable, therefore, and how ungrateful it would be, to take an averſion to him on ac<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="290" facs="unknown:026643_0295_0FD10A9FEFE2ED28"/>
ſuch as that requires far more experience than you can yet have had, and a judgment at which you cannot have arrived. I will, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, convince you, in a few minutes, of the very ſuperior advantages an old ſervant has over a young one, for fidelity, for exactneſs, and for knowledge of his buſineſs.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
               <p>I believe it, to be ſure, papa, if you ſay ſo. But then his wearing that wig! it ſeems ſo droll to ſee a man ſtanding behind your chair, and waiting upon you, with a wig on! I can never look at him without being ready to burſt out a laughing.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mr. Bellamy.</speaker>
               <p>This is a bad account of your own diſpoſition, Peregrine, and ſuch a one as I did not ſuſpect you of deſerving. Do you not know that he loſt his hair in a long and dangerous illneſs? Is not laughing at him, then, an inſult on God, who inflicted upon him that illneſs?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
               <p>But then he is ſuch a grumbler, papa! and beſides, he is not half ſo nimble as any of the others are.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Bellamy.</speaker>
               <p>No, no, Peregrine, he may be grave, or thoughtful; but I am ſure he is no grumbler. Neither, indeed, is he quite ſo alert as a young lad of eighteen or twenty; but are you therefore to hate him? Oh Peregrine! the very idea makes me ſhudder! You may alſo, then, hate me too, ſhould Heaven indulge me with a long old-age?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>

               <p>If I ſhould confeſs what I have done, papa, you would only be angry with me, and then I ſhould get puniſhed.</p>

               <speaker>Mr. Bellamy.</speaker>
               <p>You know very well, Peregrine, that I do not love to chaſtiſe you, and that it is a method of correction I employ very ſeldom. It is by reaſoning, and by gentleneſs, that I endeavour to direct and to govern both you and your ſiſter. I am ignorant what the fault is that you have committed; I cannot, therefore, make you a promiſe that you ſhall not be pun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed for it. But is that the condition you would preſcribe for making your confeſſion? Do not you know my affection for you?

               <speaker>Mr. Bellamy.</speaker>
               <p>Is it poſſible! and could you really ſo far forget what is due to ſo worthy a man? Did he hear you?</p>

               <p>Poor old John! I know well it was juſt the ſort of injury to wring his very heart. It is, indeed, very hard, at his time of life, to be made the ſport of a child; and how much more hard, when from a child whom he has known and attended from his birth, and to whom he has done ſervices and good offices that can never be repaid!</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Peregrine.</speaker>
               <p>Ah, papa, how much I have been to blame! I will go and aſk his pardon! and I promiſe you, for all my life long, that he ſhall never have to complain of me again.</p>

               <p>You will do very right; and on thoſe terms alone can you obtain forgiveneſs for yourſelf from God, or from your father.

               <p>Yes, papa; or at leaſt I thought he had. I was playing with my ſquirt, and I made aim at his face with ſome peas I had put in it.

You may always diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe as you like of what money I give you. It is your own. You could not have made a bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter uſe of my preſent.

               <speaker>Mr. Bellamy.</speaker>
               <p>Their wages are merely the pay of their work: but a preſent is a matter of favour, and will not only excite their gratitude, but induce them to go beyond what is actually their duty in ſerving you.</p>

               <p>I will explain myſelf, then by the inſtance of old John. I give him his wages, his clothes, and his food, in return for his time, his labour, and his ſervice: but when he has given me his time, his labour, and his ſervices, is he not out of my debt? Does he owe me yet more? Nevertheleſs, you well know he takes care of every thing in my houſe; that he has made himſelf ſuperintendant over the reſt of the ſervants, and that he frequently ſaves me from loſſes and impoſition. And this he does purely from perſonal regard to me, without any particular order from myſelf, and merely in

When you are old enough to mix in the world, you will hear complaints of the ingratitude and careleſſneſs of ſervants where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever you go.

               </gap>red from ſervice, lived upon his own eſtate, with an excellent wife, and five children, who were every one o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap>em worthy of ſuch parents. All the inhabitants of the neighbouring villages felt the utmoſt reſpect for them; and the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect harmony which reigned in the whole fami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, made the ſight of it pleaſant<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and even af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting to all beholders. The ſweetneſs of Captain Ford's diſpoſition, joined to the order and decorum preſerved throughout his houſe, inſured to him the good-will and admiration of whoever had the happineſs of knowing him. All the young lads who lived near his eſtate
<pb n="297" facs="unknown:026643_0302_0FD0F9E92B95CE70"/>
were eager to enter into his ſervice; and when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever there was a vacancy in his houſehold, by the death or diſcharge of any domeſtic, the place was inſtantly ſought, as if it had been an employment of high honour. Chearfulneſs and content were marked upon the countenances of all who belonged to him. They ſeemed but like humble and dutiful children waiting upon their father. His commands were always ſo juſt, and ſo eaſy, that no one had even a wiſh to diſobey them. They lived together in as ſtrict a union as if they had been brothers: or, if they had ever any diſpute, it was but of zeal for the ſervice of their maſter, and of regard for his intereſt.</p>
            <p>MR. Fenwick, an old comrade of Captain Ford, who had likewiſe retired to live in the country, though at a great diſtance from the eſtate of his friend, made him a viſit one day, as he was paſſing near his houſe in his way to the capital. After various other ſubjects, the converſation fell upon the many difficulties and inconveniences of houſe-keeping. Mr. Fenwick declared that watching and ſuperintending ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vants was the greateſt of all fatigues, and that he had never met with any who were not either inſolent, lazy, or careleſs of their maſter's con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns. I have no ſuch complaints, ſaid Captain Ford, to make of mine. I have not, for theſe ten years paſt, had one ſerious ſubject of diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure in my own houſe. I am quite ſatisfied with my ſervants, and they ſeem equally ſatisfied with me. You have uncommon good-luck, then, anſwered Mr. Fenwick; and you muſt certainly have learnt ſome ſecret, firſt of making
<pb n="298" facs="unknown:026643_0303_0FD0F9F4C6F58A38"/>
ſervants good, and then of keeping them ſo. The ſecret, anſwered Captain Ford, is a very ſimple one, and I will ſhew it to you. He then brought forth a ſtrong box. What does this mean? cried Mr. Fenwick. Captain Ford, without making any reply, opened the box; and he then ſaw ſix drawers, with theſe inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. <hi>Extra expences.—My own.—My wife's.— My children's.—Servant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ities.</hi>— As I have always a year's income before-hand, Captain Ford now anſwered, I divide it into ſix parts at the beginning of every twelve-month. in the firſt drawer, I put a certain ſum, to be ſtrictly reſerved for unexpected demands and oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions. In the ſecond, is what I allow for my own private purſe. The third contains what is neceſſary for houſe-keeping, and my wife's pin-money. The fourth, all that the education of my children, which is the beſt I can give them, ought to coſt me. The fifth, the ſervants' wages. And the ſixth, what I think proper to diſpenſe in preſents and gratuities to them. It is to this laſt drawer that I owe the happineſs of never having a bad ſervant. Their wages are only for what their ſervice makes their due; but the little gifts which I occaſionally diſtribute among them, are for good offices not included in their actual duty, but which their perſonal affection for me leads them to do, beyond either my orders or expectations.'</p>

            </head>
            <p>ON a beautiful day in the midſt of ſummer, Mr. Wilkins promiſed his two children, Dorinda and Antony, that he would take them to walk out with him in a very pretty garden, at ſome little diſtance from his houſe. He went, therefore, into his dreſſing-room to get ready, and deſired the two children to wait for him in the parlour.</p>
            <p>ANTONY, tranſported with the pleaſure he expected from this little expedition, began run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and jumping about, giddy with joy, till the ſkirt of his coat bruſhed down a very rare and curious flower, which his father was culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vating with infinite care and attention, and which, at noon-day, in order to ſhelter from the burning heat of the ſun, he had unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately removed into the room.</p>
            <p>O brother! what have you done? cried Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rinda, picking up the flower, which was broken off from the ſtem.</p>
            <p>SHE had it ſtill in her hand, when her father, having changed his dreſs, returned into the parlour.</p>
            <p>WHAT does this mean, Dorinda? exclaimed Mr. Wilkins, very angrily; have you been ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering that flower, which you have ſeen me take ſo much pains to cultivate, on purpoſe to preſerve its ſeed? Dear papa, cried Dorinda, trembling, don't be angry, pray!</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="300" facs="unknown:026643_0305_0FD10AA9976EBBC8"/>I ſhall not be angry now, anſwered Mr. Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kins, recovering his temper; but leſt you ſhould happen to have the ſame fancy for gathering flowers in the garden to which I am going, and which does not belong to me, you muſt not be ſurpriſed that I think it neceſſary to leave you at home.</p>
            <p>DORINDA looked down, and ſaid nothing; but Antony would no longer be ſilent. He approached his father, while his eyes ſwam in tears, and ſaid to him: It was not my ſiſter, papa, it was I that broke off the flo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>r: ſo it muſt be for me to ſtay at home; but pray let Dorinda go.</p>
            <p>MR. Wilkins, touched by the ingenuouſneſs of his children, and by the affection which they ſhewed for each other, tenderly embraced them, and ſaid: You are both of you my darlings, and you ſhall go with me together.</p>
            <p>DORINDA and Antony jumped for joy. They were then taken to the garden, where all the moſt curious plants were pointed out to them. Mr. Wilkins obſerved, with much ſatisfaction, that while they were walking in the flower-beds, Dorinda preſſed her frock tight down on each ſide with her hands, while Antony h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>d up the flaps of his coat under his arms, from the fear of doing any miſchief.</p>
            <p>THE flower which Mr. Wilkins had loſt, would probably have given him ſome pleaſure; but he received infinitely more in viewing the fraternal tenderneſs, the candour and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cretion which flouriſhed in his children.</p>

            <head>THE INSTRUCTIVE DISAPPOINTMENT.</head>
            <p>IN a beautiful morning in the month of June, Alexis had got himſelf ready to accompany his father upon a party of pleaſure, which had occupied all his hopes and thoughts for a fort-night before. Contrary to his uſual cuſtom, he had riſen very early, to haſten the preparations for his expedition: but juſt at the inſtant, when he fancied he had arrived at the accompliſhment of his expectations, the ſky became dark, the clouds thickened and grew black, and a moſt tempeſtuous wind beat down the branches of the trees, and blew up the duſt in whirlwinds. Alexis ran continually into the garden, to exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the ſky; and then ſkipt up ſtairs, three ſteps at a time, to conſult the barometer<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but both the ſky and the barometer agreed in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>appointing his wiſhes. Nevertheleſs, he ſcrup<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ed not to aſſure his father they might go in ſafety, that all theſe gloomy threats would diſperſe into nothing, that the weather would be finer than before, and that they ought to ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>MR. Pierſon, however, who had no blind confidence in the foreſight of his ſon, thought it wiſer to wait a little longer: and ſoon after, the clouds ſuddenly burſt, and a torrent of rain
<pb n="306" facs="unknown:026643_0311_0FD10ABE17FB9E30"/>
fell upon the earth. Alexis, then, aſhamed as well as grieved, burſt into a flood of tears, and refuſed all conſolation.</p>
            <p>THE rain continued till three o'clock in the afternoon: the clouds then diſperſed, the ſun recovered its ſplendour, the ſky its ſerenity, and all nature ſeemed reſtored to the freſhneſs of ſpring. The temper of Alexis cleared, like the horizon, by degrees. His father took him out into the fields; where the calmneſs of the air, the warbling of the birds, the beauty of the meadows, and the ſweet perfumes breathing every where around him, ſoon brought back peace and good humour into his boſom.</p>
            <p>DO you obſerve, ſaid his father, how de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightful a change has juſt been made throughout the creation? Recollect but the gloomy face of things, which ſo lately ſaddened us: the earth, you may remember, was parched, and opened in wide gaps from the long drought: the flow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers loſt their ſweet ſmell, and bent their droop<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing heads; all vegetation ſeemed at an end. To what muſt we attribute this ſudden renewal of the beauties of nature? To the rain we have had, to-day, papa, anſwered Alexis: and, in pronouncing theſe words, he was inſtantly ſtruck himſelf with the folly of his behaviour, and the injuſtice of his repining. He coloured; and his father judged by his conſciouſneſs, that his own reflexions would ſuffice to teach him, for the future, to ſacrifice, without murmuring, his perſonal gratification, for the general good.</p>

            <head>THE SECRET OF PLEASURE.</head>
            <p>I WISH I might do nothing but play all day long, mama, cried little Laura to Mrs. Draper, her mother.</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Draper.</speaker>
               <p>What! nothing elſe for the whole day?</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Laura.</speaker>
               <p>Yes, mama, nothing elſe at all.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Draper.</speaker>
               <p>I have no deſire but to make you happy, my love; but I am ſure playing ſo long will only tire you.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Laura.</speaker>
               <p>Playing tire me, mama! O no, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed! you ſhall ſee if it will.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>LAURA then, jumping at every other ſtep, flew in ſearch of all her play-things. She ſoon got them together: but ſhe was quite alone, for her ſiſters were employed in ſtudying with their ſeveral maſters till dinner-time.</p>
            <p>SHE enjoyed her liberty at firſt with all poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſpirit, and, for one whole hour, was perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly happy: but, after that, ſhe began to grow weary, and every moment took from her ſome portion of her pleaſure.</p>
            <p>SHE had already looked at her play-things, one after another, an hundred times; and now ſhe knew not what to do next. Even her fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourite doll diſpleaſed and tired her.</p>
            <p>SHE went to her mama, and begged ſhe would tell her of ſome new amuſement, and play with her a little herſelf; but, unfortunately, Mrs. Draper was engaged in ſettling ſome affairs of
<pb n="308" facs="unknown:026643_0313_0FD10AC18EEDB760"/>
importance; and ſhe was therefore forced to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſe Laura's requeſt, however unwillingly.</p>
            <p>THE little girl then ſeated herſelf mournfully, in a corner, where, uncomfortable and yawn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſhe waited till her ſiſters had finiſhed their leſſons, and were allowed to find entertainment for themſelves.</p>
            <p>THIS time, at laſt, arrived. Laura ran up to them, and, in a doleful voice, told them how long the morning had ſeemed to her, and how impatient ſhe had been for their coming.</p>
            <p>THEY now made choice of their moſt favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ite plays, in order to raiſe the ſpirits of their little ſiſter, who was tenderly loved by them all.</p>
            <p>BUT, alas! their kindneſs was in vain. Laura declared ſhe was quite ſick of all theſe plays al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready, and that they did not give her the leaſt pleaſure; and added, ſhe believed they were all in a plot againſt her, not to chuſe any game that ſhe liked.</p>
            <p>ADELAIDE, her eldeſt ſiſter, who was a young lady of ten years of age, and very ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and reaſonable, now took her by the hand, and ſaid to her, with great ſweetneſs:</p>
            <p>LOOK at us all, Laura, one after another, as we ſtand here together; and then I will tell you who among us it is that occaſions your diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent.</p>

               </speaker>
               <p>And who is it, then, ſiſter? for I am ſure I can't find out.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Adelaide.</speaker>
               <p>That is only becauſe you have not looked at yourſelf. Yes, my dear Laura, it is nobody but yourſelf; you ſee very well that theſe plays ſtill amuſe us, notwithſtanding we
<pb n="309" facs="unknown:026643_0314_0FD10AC3C8701860"/>
have played at them ſo often, and that even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you were born. But we are juſt come from doing our taſks, which makes every thing ſeem new to us. If you had earned your plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, as we have done, by working, you would find it as ſweet as we do.</p>
            </sp>
            <p>LAURA, who, child as ſhe was, did not want for underſtanding, was much ſtruck by her ſiſter's diſcourſe. It taught her that, to be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally happy, it was neceſſary to mingle uſeful ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes with pleaſant diverſions. And I know not whether, ſince that time, ſhe would not have conceived a greater dread of a whole day of mere pleaſure, than of one filled up with every employment, ſuch as was ſuited to her age.</p>

            <head>THE BIRD's NEST.</head>
            <p>MAMA, Mama! cried little Simon, one evening, as, quite out of breath, he ran up to his mother, only look at what's in my hat!</p>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Beville.</speaker>
               <p>Ha ha, a little bird! and where did you get it?</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
               <p>I found a neſt this morning in the garden-hedge: ſo I waited till it was night; and then I ſlid ſoftly up to the buſh, and before ever the bird was aware, pop! I caught it by the wings.</p>

            <sp>

               <p>No, mama, all its children were there too. But they are ſo little, they have got no feathers on yet: ſo I am not afraid of their eſcaping.</p>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Mrs. Beville.</speaker>

            <sp>
               <speaker>Simon.</speaker>
               <p>I ſhall put it in a cage, and hook it up in my room.</p>

Take courage, my child; I have ſaid this merely to

try you. Your father is not in priſon, and nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther your ſiſter nor yourſelf are going to be confined.

                  <p>To me that is a great recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendation. Your father was a man of high honour, and an officer of noble courage.

                  <p>And that is doing every thing. The greateſt of men cannot do more. You ſee here, Sir, your mother. Her virtues, and the fair promiſe I ſee in your amiable little brother of inheriting them, have given me the moſt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous idea of all your family; and it is owing to this that I have deſired to aſſemble you all before me.</p>
