            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>A DAY much to be remembered is that, which we are this afternoon met toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther here in God's houſe, religiouſly to commemorate; yea a day never to be forgotten. It will be handed down to our poſterity, of the lateſt generations, what occured at LEXINGTON, upon the <hi>Nineteenth</hi> of <hi>April,</hi> 1775.</p>
            <p>FIVE paſſing years, have not in the leaſt eraſed from our minds the memory of that bloo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy and murderous ſcene, here began and ſince carried on by <hi>George's</hi> troops in our land.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:016873_0004_0F9EC0FFA25AFF88"/>
IT is ſtill freſh in our minds, what feelings we had when the thunder of war firſt burſt forth upon us, and our friends here fell a ſacrifice to enraged malice. We are men, and can recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lect what a ferment our blood and ſpirits were in, when we who were at a diſtance before the riſing of that morning ſun, received the ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dings of your ſad fate, and garments rolled in blood. It flew as it were upon the wings of the wind. The firſt report was, that one third part of the town had fallen before the enemy. Bleſſed be God it did not prove true.</p>
            <p>WE heard the calling to arms with ſurprize, yet with reſolution by God's help, to ſtand forth in the defence of the land, and repel force with force.</p>
            <p>THE great ſuperintendant of the world, cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the arrows of his quiver to enter into our reins—we were filled with bitterneſs—our ſoul was removed far off from peace—we forgot proſperity. At this day we remember our afflic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and miſery, the worm wood and the gall. Our ſoul hath them ſtill in remembrance, and is humbled in us.</p>
            <p>WE had fainted, unleſs we had believed to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord in the land of the living.</p>
            <p>WHAT ſupported us, was the goodneſs and juſtice of our cauſe. That the Lord would not caſt off forever, but though he cauſe grief, <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> will have compaſſion, according to the mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:016873_0005_0F9EC0FFC3BCAA40"/>
of his tender mercies. For he doth not afflict willingly, or grieve the children of men. And though clouds and darkneſs are round about him; yet juſtice and judgment are the habitation of his throne; for the judge of all the earth can do nothing but right.</p>
            <p>IN the midſt of our thoughts within us, we were able to ſay, let God be judge.</p>
            <p>TO heaven we appealed as the protector of his people, and avenger of the injured.—we were ready to adopt the language of Joab—be of good courage, and let us behave ourſelves valiantly, for our people, and for the cities of our God, and let the Lord do that which is good in his ſight.</p>
            <p>THE enemy, as if it was a thing pleaſing to them to diſlodge ſouls, and had received the diſpoſition of their minds from him who was a murderer from the beginning, and is called the great enemy of God, upon the ſhedding the firſt blood, were ready to give their ſhout. But the triumphing of the wicked was ſhort.</p>
            <p>THEIR march was ſoon obſtructed and their retreat became neceſſary.—In a very few hours their huzza's, their laughter was turned into mourning, by the fall of many of their party, and the groans and cries of the wounded. A juſt puniſhment of the murder they had com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted in the morning.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:016873_0006_0F9EC1008303AAE0"/>
THE day indeed was diſtreſſing to us, and will be related as ſuch to the children yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born. But God was with us to uphold us.—"If it had not been the Lord who was on our ſide, then may Iſrael ſay; if it had not been the Lord who was on our ſide, when men roſe up againſt us; then they had ſwallowed us quick, when their wrath was kindled againſt us."</p>
            <p>OUR hope was in the living God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> who made heaven and earth. Who graciouſly appeared for us that day, as he has ever ſince done, through the courſe of this diſtreſſing war. God was our refuge, a preſent help in trouble. He has been with us to conduct us in dark and diſtreſſing times. Bleſſed be the Lord God of Iſrael, who hath not given us a prey to the enemy.</p>
            <p>MY brother who came before me, and was your remembrancer the laſt year, then mention<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed a variety of inſtances, wherein the Lord hath helped us, how his power and goodneſs have been very conſpicuous. I may now this day re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peat it and ſay, "hitherto hath the Lord helped us," and can only add at this time, that it was our belief in the divine government, which ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported and kept us from ſinking in the ſea of trouble, God in his righteous and wiſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence has called us to paſs through.—We may well join with David in the languague of our text and ſay, I had fainted, unleſs I had believed, to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord in the land of the living—and receive his excellent advice and
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:016873_0007_0F9EC1014CB93F78"/>
counſel—wait on the Lord, be of good courage, and he ſhall ſtrengthen thine heart, wait I ſay on the Lord.</p>
            <p>From the words of our text we may obſerve,</p>
            <p>THAT faith and truſt in the government of divine providence, is the great ſupport of God's people in the moſt perilous and diſtreſſing times.</p>
            <p>FIRST. IT may be particularly conſidered, that the people of God, when preſſed with ſore troubles and difficulties, ſtand in need of ſupport, and a place of refuge to flee unto. And</p>
            <p>SECONDLY. I ſhall ſhow how faith in the providence of God ſupports the ſoul, in preſſing troubles and difficulties.</p>
            <p>I. THE people of God, when preſſed with ſore troubles, ſtand in need of ſupport, and a place of refuge to flee unto. Agreeable to the Pſal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſt; in God ſays he, is my ſalvation, and my glory; the rock of my ſtrength, and my refuge is in God—truſt in him at all times ye peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple—God is a refuge for us. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 62, 7, 8.</p>
            <p>The providences of God are promiſcuouſly diſpenſed to the children of men here in this ſtate. The righteouſneſs of the righteous, is not always upon him, or the wickedneſs of the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon him in this world. But the righteous is often exerciſed with adverſity and trouble, and the wicked flouriſh in earthly proſperity. By
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:016873_0008_0F9EC102A61A97C8"/>
this means men are properly in a ſtate of trial and probation, and their final ſtate to be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined according to their conduct and behaviour here. The goodneſs of God does not always lead men to repentance and engage them to fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in his ſervice; nor is the righteous at all times overwhelmed with adverſity. Both proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity and adverſity ought to be ſo improved by us, as to excite us to acknowledge God as the diſpenſer of them.</p>
            <p>IT is the wicked man's crime to be unmindful of the divine goodneſs, and attribute his ſucceſſes to his own wiſdom and induſtry. And it argues great diſtruſt in the wiſdom and goodneſs of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence, for the righteous man to be overwhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med in the day of trouble and adverſity, becauſe he may be ſure God can bring him out of trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and has declared all things ſhall work toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther for good, to ſuch as love God, and make conſcience of walking in obedience to his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands. Becauſe the righteous ſtand in great need of ſupport in the day when troubles preſs hard upon him, therefore God has ſaid, call upon me in the day of trouble; I will deliver thee, and thou ſhall glorify me.</p>
            <p>IT ſeems abſolutely neceſſary to man's preſent ſtate in this world, that there ſhould be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing for him to lean upon, and have recourſe unto as his ſupport and refuge. "Every man at his beſt eſtate, is but a feeble, infirm creature; what from the weakneſs of his own mind, the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:016873_0009_0F9EC103463C34E8"/>
diſorder of his own paſſions from within"; to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with all that train of evils he ſhall una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voidably meet withal from without, "the great obſcurity which there is in the nature of things, that uncertainty which attends the iſſues and events of them; the mutability of all human affairs" and the impoſſibility of providing againſt all events that may poſſibly come to paſs: from theſe conſiderations it appears, that to believe in the goodneſs of God and hope in his mercy, are altogether neceſſary to the ſtate of men in this world, and they muſt always be in an unſafe, unquiet condition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> unleſs they have ſomewhat to ſupport and relieve them in their ſtraits and difficulties. "Our conditions in this world are often in ſcripture repreſented by a ſtate of war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare, wherein the virtues of faith and hope, are ſaid to be our breaſtplate, our ſhield, and our helmet, the chief defenſive army, whereby we are to be guarded againſt all aſſaults. And ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times by a ſtate travelling by ſea, wherein hope is our anchor, that which muſt fix and keep us ſteady in the midſt of all ſtorms." Which hope we have, ſays the apoſtle "as an anchor of the ſoul, both ſure and ſtedfaſt". As the anchor is to ſecure the ſhip from daſhing againſt the rocks when the tempeſt ariſes, ſo a firm belief in the goodneſs of God keeps the ſoul of the ſaint from being overwhelmed when troubles and afflictions ſurround him. How diſtreſſing would be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of many a one, did they not believe there was a God, that governed the world and ordered all events? How would they ſink down into the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:016873_0010_0F9EC103844B9430"/>
depths of deſpair, were they not ſure God was able to bring them out of the furnace of afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and had declared he was ever ready to hear the cries of the diſtreſſed.</p>
            <p>SUCH is the ſtate of things in this world, that adverſity will unavoidably be the portion of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of the children of men. And at times ſuch diſtreſſes as ſeem almoſt unſurmountable, but this keeps up the ſpirits of the righteous, that God governs the world, and can bring good out of evil, and order out of confuſion—can ſo over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rule men's minds and order events, as finally to promote his own glory, and the good of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple.—Which brings me to the ſecond general head of my diſcourſe at this time.—namely,</p>
            <p>II. To ſhow how faith in the providence of God, ſupports the ſoul in diſtreſſing troubles and difficulties. I had fainted, ſays David in our text, unleſs I had believed to ſee the goodneſs of the Lord in the land of the living.</p>
            <p>ALL the divine attributes unite to render God amiable in the ſight of the chriſtian, and excite faith and confidence in him. He that really believes God to be what is declared of him in the ſacred oracles, the wiſe, holy, and good go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernor of the world, will derive ſupport from him in preſſing troubles. Becauſe he knows ſuch a Being will provide for, and take care of his people, ſo that nothing ſhall befall them but what ſhall eventually terminate for their good,

provided they live in the diſcharge of their own duty. Particularly I may ſay,</p>
            <p n="1">1. THE chriſtian firmly confides in the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of divine government, and is hence ſuppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, under the troubles and perplexities attending this frail ſtate.</p>
            <p>THIS is expreſsly aſſerted in the holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, the Lord is a God of knowledge and by him actions are weigh'd; and ſays the Pſalmiſt, his underſtanding is infinite. He is perfectly acquainted with our condition and circumſtances in the world. Whatever difficulties we may be in, he knows how to extricate us out of them. If we are ſeeking to obtain that which will be hurtful to us, he knows how to diſappoint us. Are we in want of real neceſſaries, he can eaſily deviſe means to relieve us, and often times makes proviſion for his people in ways unknown to us, and often beyond all human expectation. We have ſeen it verified in the courſe of the preſent war. We have fought our enemies with their own weapons which God has put into our hands. Are we in fear and tremble at impending evils, ſeeing no way to eſcape? His infinite wiſdom and underſtanding can inſtantly find out, and open a way for us to be ſet at liberty, and avoid the thing we ſo much ſeared. In a word, he can alſo diſappoint us in our enterpriſes, when he ſees the accompliſhment of them will not be beſt for us. So that as the wiſe man has ſaid, "the race ſhall not be to the ſwift, nor the battle
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:016873_0012_0F9EC1050F4C2EF8"/>
to the ſtrong, neither yet bread to the wiſe, nor yet riches to men of underſtanding, nor yet fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to men of ſkill; "for as he ſays, <hi>'Prov.</hi> 21, 30. There is no wiſdom nor underſtanding nor counſel againſt the Lord; the horſe is prepared againſt the day of battle, but ſafety is of the Lord. There are many devices he tells us in a man's heart, nevertheleſs the counſel of the Lord that ſhall ſtand." This is a ſufficient rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon why the chriſtian ſhould place his hope and confidence in God. This yields him mighty ſupport in the day of trouble, that God infinitely wiſe governs the world, knows what it beſt for us, and can project ways for the effecting it.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The chriſtian is aſſured God is boundleſs in his goodneſs, love and grace to men, therefore ever ready to help and relieve them.</p>
            <p>THIS begets a ſtrong confidence in him, and calms the mind in the day of adverſity. The Pſalmiſt has declared that "God is good to all, and his tender mercies are over all". He is ever friendly and beneficent to his creatures.</p>
            <p>EARTHLY friends may leave and forſake us, but God will never forſake ſuch as place their confidence in him upon the principles of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. Solomon has told us, a friend loveth at all times. A true friend loveth in all ſtates and conditions, and a brother is born for adverſity. And there is a friend that ſticketh cloſer than a brother. God is ſuch a one. And for the ſame
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:016873_0013_0F9EC105C34305A0"/>
reaſon others forſake us, will God ſtand by to aid and aſſiſt us. Others forſake us, becauſe we are in trouble and adverſity, and ſome pains and care are neceſſary in order to yield us relief. God ſees our need and is ready to help, becauſe we are in trouble. He has told us to repair to him in this caſe.—This is the argument he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lows us to make uſe of to prevail with him to ariſe for our help and aſſiſtance; <hi>Pſal.</hi> 22, 11. "Be not far from me for trouble is near; for there is none to help.—"Bow down thine ear O Lord, hear me for I am poor and needy—pull me out of the net that they have laid privily for me; for thou art my ſtrength, into thine hand I commit my ſpirit." "That which among men, ſays one<note n="*" place="bottom">Biſhop Wilkings.</note> is uſually the chief occaſion to take off their affection and kindneſs, namely miſery and affliction, is a principal argument to entitle us to the favour of God, and therefore is fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently made uſe of by good men in holy ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to that purpoſe." That God is the helper of the fatherleſs, will regard the cries of the afflicted, and is nigh unto all them that call upon him, is a powerful argument why we ſhould ever place our truſt and confidence in him. This keeps the ſoul from deſpondency in the day of affliction, ſupplies it with needed ſtrength, and keeps the mind ſteady in the way God directs. The conſideration of the divine attributes elevates our ſoul, and encourages us to perſevere. But how ſad is the ſtate of that ſoul, who can have no hope in God, when troubles ſurround him.
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:016873_0014_0F9EC106F2DF73E8"/>
What perplexities does he feel? what anguiſh takes hold of him? This was the ſupport of the Pſalmiſt in a diſtreſſing day, that though God ſhould hide his face from him, yet he would be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve he ſhould' ere long ſee of his goodneſs in the land of the living. This was Paul's lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guague, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1, 3, 4. "Bleſſed be God, even the father of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt, the father of mercies, and the God of all comfort; who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forteth us in all our tribulations, that we may be able to comfort them which are in any trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, by the comfort where-with we ourſelves are comforted of God."</p>
            <p n="3">3. THAT God is matchleſs in his power and able to do every thing he ſees will be beſt for his creatures, is a mighty ſupport to the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving ſoul in the day of adverſity. I know ſays the Pſalmiſt, "that the Lord is great, and that our Lord is above all Gods. Whatſoever the Lord pleaſed, that did he in Heaven, and in Earth, in the ſeas, and all deep places." Becauſe it is God that giveth power to the ſaint; and to them that have no might he increaſeth ſtrength, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould we hope in his mercy, and place our confidence in his almighty arm.</p>
            <p>THIS was the prophet's language, "truſt ye in the Lord forever: For in the Lord Jehovah is everlaſting ſtrength." He is the rock of ages, able to ſave at all times, and out of all troubles. Accordingly is called "the hope of Iſrael, and the Saviour thereof in the time of trouble". He is
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:016873_0015_0F9EC107636A6030"/>
the confidence of all the ends of the earth, and of them that are afar off upon the ſea. This is a neceſſary qualification in that Being in whom we place our confidence, that he is one who is able to help us, and this ability is truly in God, and in him alone. In vain is ſalvation hoped for from the hills, and from the multitude of mountains; truly in the Lord our God, ſays the Prophet, is the ſalvation of Iſrael, Jer. 3, 23. Thus the Pſalmiſt profeſſes his faith in the power and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence of God; truly my ſoul waiteth upon God; from him cometh my ſalvation. He is able to help and deliver me. It is as if he ſaid, I am fully convinced I have no reaſon to hope for de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance but from God, no arm of fleſh is ſuffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient, it muſt come from the Lord. He only is my rock and my ſalvation—He is my defence. Ready to eſpouſe my cauſe. None elſe are able if they were willing. For ſurely men of low degree are vanity, and men of high degree are a lie; to be laid in the balance they are altogether lighter than vanity. Hence he cautions men againſt placing their confidence in ſuch as will diſappoint them. Put not your truſt in princes, nor in the ſon of man, in whom is no help, his breath goeth forth, he returneth to his earth; in that very day his thoughts periſh.</p>
            <p>HAPPY is he that hath the God of Jacob for his help, whoſe hope is in the Lord his God: which made heaven and earth, the ſea and all that therein is. The prophet Iſaiah alſo is as particular and full in his counſel and advice,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:016873_0016_0F9EC108D5129F70"/>
Ceaſe ye from man, whoſe breath is in his noſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trils; for wherein is he to be accounted off. Don't depend upon any creature, but place your confidence in God—He is the only Being, that can help and ſave us; for he is the orderer of all events. Therefore it is ſaid, <hi>Job</hi> 34, 29. When he giveth quietneſs, who then can make trouble And when he hideth his face, who then can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold him? Whether it be done againſt a nation, or againſt a man only.</p>
            <p n="4">4. WHAT adds greatly to the ſupport of the ſuffering and afflicted ſaint is this, that God is unchangeable, ever remains the fame, in wiſdom, power and goodneſs, therefore may always be confided in.</p>
            <p>As goodneſs is eſſential to the divine nature, ſo this is a ſtrong ground of hope. Was God all juſtice, then nothing could be expected from him, by any fallen creature, but ſeverity of wrath. But he has proclaimed his name, the Lord, the Lord God, gracious and merciful, &amp;c. And there is forgiveneſs with him, that he may be ſeared. It is an argument, why he ſhould be had in the greateſt reverence, becauſe he is ſo good, gracious and compaſſionate, and never chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges. This is the divine reaſoning, <hi>Malachi</hi> 3, 6. I am the Lord, I change not, therefore the ſons of Jacob are not conſumed; as if he had ſaid, were it not for my unchangeable nature, the chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of men would be in miſerable circumſtances Since my long-ſuffering changeth not, they are
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:016873_0017_0F9EC109AFCE4FD0"/>
not conſumed in their ſins; but have a ſpace for repentance, and an opportunity to eſcape deſerved puniſhment.</p>
            <p>EARTHLY friends may make great proteſtati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of kindneſs and friendſhip, and our expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions may be raiſed; but how ſuddenly may their minds be changed, their conduct altered, and we ſuddenly diſappointed? Or they may be ſuddenly taken out of the world by death, then all their kind offices towards us muſt ceaſe, and we left in a ſorrowful and afflicted condition.</p>
            <p>BUT God is from everlaſting to everlaſting, the ſame yeſterday to day and forever. With him there is no variableneſs, neither ſhadow of turning; therefore does the prophet ſay, bleſſed is the man that truſteth in the Lord, and whoſe hope the Lord is. "For he ſhall be as a tree plant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the waters, and that ſpreadeth out her roots by the river, and ſhall not ſee when heat cometh: But her leaf ſhall be green and ſhall not be careful in the year of drought, neither ſhall ceaſe from yielding fruit." Seeing God is immutable, the children of men may ſafely con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fide in him, and at all times make him their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge. Says the prophet, therefore will the Lord wait, that he may be gracious unto you, and therefore will he be, exalted, that he may have mercy upon you: For the Lord is a God of judgment; bleſſed are all they that wait for him. And ſays David in our text<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> wait on the Lord; be of good courage, and he ſhall ſtrengthen thine heart; wait I ſay on the Lord. The Pſalmiſt
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:016873_0018_0F9EC10C09FEF9A8"/>
encourages his hope in God, from the conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, that others had experienced the divine ſalvation. <hi>Pſalm</hi> 22, 45. Our fathers ſays he, truſted in thee, O thou that inhabiteſt the praiſes of Iſrael; they truſted, and thou didſt deliver them, they cried unto thee, and were delivered—they truſted in thee, and were not confound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed—Thou haſt made me to hope—Be not far from me, for trouble is nigh—Ye that fear the Lord, praiſe him; all ye ſeed of Jacob glorify him; and fear him all ye ſeed of Iſrael. "For he hath not deſpiſed, nor abhorred the affliction of the afflicted; neither has he hid his face from him, but when he cried unto him he heard."</p>
            <p>THUS I have laid before you, in a very imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect manner, the ſcripture grounds and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, for faith and truſt in the government of divine providence, and been able to do little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſides ſtiring up your minds by way of remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance.</p>
            <p>What remains now is by way of application.</p>
            <p>WE may hence ſee, it is not only the duty, but the greateſt happineſs of men, to place their hope and confidence in God, under preſſing difficulties.</p>
            <p>AGREEABLE to the prophet; who is among you that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> the Lord, that obeyeth the voice of his ſervant, that walketh in darkneſs, and hath no light? Let him truſt in the name of the Lord, and ſtay upon his God, Iſai. 50, 10.
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:016873_0019_0F9EC10D46F59208"/>
With great propriety it may be ſaid, God's re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to us, and ours to him, make it our duty to truſt in him.</p>
            <p>As God is our Creator, we are to acknowledge him as ſuch—as he at firſt gave us our being, ſo he alone can maintain it, therefore we are to confide in him.</p>
            <p>As God is the fountain of all good, ſo to him, we are to make our addreſſes for all we need.</p>
            <p>FOR a man to neglect God, is really to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſe his own happineſs; at leaſt not conſider where it is to be placed.</p>
            <p>HE that does not acknowledge God, as the great governor of the world, the orderer of all events, the beſtower of all good, may be ſaid to live without God. He is expoſed to that cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, <hi>Jer.</hi> 17, 5. Thus ſaith the Lord, curſed be the man that truſteth in man, and maketh fleſh his arm, and whoſe heart departeth from the Lord.</p>
            <p>GOD is a Being every way fit to be truſted in, infinite in his wiſdom, almighty in his pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, boundleſs in his goodneſs, and unchangeable in his nature. Ever ready to hear the ſupplicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of his diſtreſſed people, and grant them re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief.</p>
            <p>THUS it is evident from the whole run of ſcripture teſtimony, as alſo the experience of all
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:016873_0020_0F9EC10E1CC24E00"/>
the ſaints, that it is not only the duty, but the greateſt felicity of man, to have his hope placed in God, when perilous times ariſe. They that truſt in the Lord, ſays the Pſalmiſt, ſhall be as mount Zion, which cannot be removed, but abi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deth forever. As the mountains are round about Jeruſalem, ſo the Lord is round about his people, to defend and ſuccour them, and beſtow all needed bleſſings, as his wiſdom ſees meet. God's covenant and promiſe, ſhall never fail any of the children of men. All things here below may be changed, and fail, but God will ſtill abide the ſame to his people; and they may truly ſay, in the Lord Jehovah is everlaſting ſtrength; therefore will we truſt in him. Tho' wars and tumults ariſe, yet we will not be diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mayed with fear and anxiety, at what may come to paſs. On the divine word we will reſt, which, ſays God, is our refuge and ſtrength, a very pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent help in trouble; therefore will not we fear, though the earth be removed, and though the mountains be carried away into the midſt of the ſea. Though every thing may ſeem to be in a great confuſion, yet there is a river, the ſtreams whereof ſhall make glad the city of God. There is a God, that is over and above all, who guides the affairs of this lower world. God is in the midſt of his church, ſhe ſhall not be moved: God ſhall help her, and that right early. In his own good time, he will ariſe and make bare his arm, ſhew his marvellous power, and his enemies ſhall be ſcattered. The heathen may

rage and the kingdoms be moved, but when he uttereth his voice the earth ſhall be melted.</p>
            <p>WE are aſſured what great things God has done for ſuch as have truſted in him. He has never failed to free them out of their troubles, let them be of what ſort ſoever, or their caſe ever ſo difficult. Let the circumſtances of a people be ever ſo diſtreſſing, or calamity nigh, God is able to deviſe means for their help, and open a way for their deliverance. To the upright there ſhall ariſe light in darkneſs. We ſee with great pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priety David might ſay to his ſoul in a day of preſſing troubles, and encourage himſelf in God, as in the text; wait on the Lord, O my ſoul, be of good courage, and he ſhall ſtrengthen thine heart; wait I ſay on the Lord. How much does it become us at the preſent day my hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, when our difficulties are ſo many and great, to exerciſe faith and truſt in the government of divine providence.</p>
            <p>GOD can ſcatter theſe dark clouds, cauſe his holy ſpirit powerfully to opperate upon men's minds, and preſently alter the appearances of things.—I doubt not my brethren, many of you can give full teſtimony to the truth of what has been ſaid, that you had fainted in theſe diſtreſs<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing times that have paſſed over us, if you had not believed, to ſee of the goodneſs of the Lord, in the land of the living.</p>

flame of war firſt burſt forth? Was not God with you as your upholder, and comforter? Did not the ſacred oracles, afford you ſome ſupport? Did you not repair to God as the city of your refuge, and deſire he would diſplay his power on your behalf? Did you not then feel a lively ſenſe of the need of divine help? Was not God's government acknowledged, and did not the precepts of his word ſilence your complaints? Were ſome of your houſes then in flames, (as has been the ſad caſe of whole towns ſince) Was not this the languague of holy writ? The Lord reigneth; he is cloathed with majeſty, clouds and darkneſs are round about him; righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs and judgment are the habitation of his throne.</p>
            <p>WERE our friends fallen by the weapons of our enemy and wallowing in their gore? Did not this cry in our ears? Be ſtill and know that I am God. Is our ſubſtance laid waſte, Jeſus has taught us to ſay, Father, not my will, but thine be done.</p>
            <p>OUR friends, that fell here by the hands of murderers, are now ſleeping in the duſt, and hear not the voice of the oppreſſor; but are not their ſouls now crying with a loud voice, ſaying—How long O Lord, holy and true, doſt not thou judge and avenge our blood on them that dwell on the earth? Their blood like that of Abel cryeth unto the Lord from the ground. God is juſt, but the perpetrators of that murder,

            <p>FOR a prince to wage war with his ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects without provocation, as was the caſe of the Britiſh King, when hoſtilities here firſt commenced, he muſt be accountable at God's tribunal for the blood murderouſly ſhed.<note n="*" place="bottom">Says the great Mr. Locke, "Whenever the legiſlators endeavour to take away, and deſtroy the property of the people, or reduce them to ſlavery under arbitrary power, they put themſelves into a ſtate of war with the people, who are there upon abſolved from any farther obedience, and are left to the common refuge, which God has pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for all men, againſt force and violence.

place to place, without moleſtation. We re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joice you had ſpirit on ſo ſudden an occaſion, to reſiſt tyranny at the peril of your lives. And you ſee how ready your brethren were to concur with, aid and aſſiſt you upon the ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt intelligence. The ſtroke firſt given was heavy indeed in this place, we all lament it—we thank God, no more of you were ſuffered to fall.—The ſpirit you diſcovered upon that day, was noble.—Zeal for your country's good inſpired your breaſt.—What more excellent than a love for our country! Would to God it were more extenſive and better directed!—By your appearing under arms this day, we truſt you give us a token, you will ever be ready to ſtand forth in the defence of the land, whene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver occaſion calls for it. The ſoldiery are ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for the defence of the land againſt the inſults of oppreſſing tyrants (as we are ſufficient<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly taught at this day) and are to be reſpected in their place.

them greater opportunities to bite and devour one another.—With a very ill grace, many that pretend friendſhip to their country, complain of the cruelties of the Britons, having leſs humani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty themſelves.—A ſorrowful thing whenever there is occaſion to ſay it.</p>
            <p>WE never need diſtruſt the divine power and ability to help and ſave us.—But we muſt be qualified ſubjects for mercy, by becoming a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting and reforming people. If we turn to the Lord, in the way of our duty, he will turn to us in ways of mercy, and cauſe his face to ſhine upon us. But ſo long as we love our ſins, we muſt expect trouble.—Our covetouſneſs, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſtice, oppreſſion and hard heartedneſs, muſt be put away, as we deſire to ſee proſperous days. We muſt value the goſpel, if we would have it continued to us.</p>
            <p>OUR dependence can never be too firmly placed in the divine Being, if we properly behave ourſelves and do our duty.</p>
            <p>LET it be our care to be acquainted with God, as he has revealed himſelf in the ſacred ſcriptures. Acquaint now thyſelf with him, ſays Eliphaz to Job, and be at peace; thereby ſhall good come unto thee. We muſt know him in his works, as the creator of all things in heaven and earth, viſible and inviſible; as the great ſuperintendant of the world, whoſe univerſal providence upholds and governs all things; provides for and ſupplies the returning wants of his creatures.—As the governor a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the nations, who orders the events of peace and war, proſperity and adverſity.</p>

PARTICULARLY let us labour to know God in Jeſus Chriſt; then we ſhall ſee the propriety of truſt in him, for all the favours and bleſſings we want for this world, and that which is to come.</p>
            <p>LET every one exert himſelf to the utmoſt of his ability, for the ſetting up of civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, upon the beſt plan that can be agreed upon, though it may not be according to every man's mind. The bleſſings of civil government are many and great, ought to be prized and ſought after by all.</p>
            <p>A people without law, (or with laws poorly executed which is much the ſame) will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently become deſtitute of juſtice, and righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs.<note n="†" place="bottom">
                  <p>"Where the laws cannot be executed, it is all one as if there were no laws; and government without laws is, I ſuppoſe a myſtery in polities, unconceivable to human capacity, and inconſiſtent with human ſociety."</p>
                  <p>Locke on government, P. 390.</p>
               </note> The ſetting up of civil government among us is neceſſary, for the bringing on a better ſtate of things; yea abſolutely neceſſary, and none can oppoſe it but ſuch as are igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant of their own intereſt.</p>
            <p>WE wiſh for the out-pouring of the holy ſpirit from on high, a reformation of man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, a revival of religion, and a truly chriſtian temper among men, then we may hope for proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity.</p>
            <p>GOD grant, that the time may be haſtened, when peace, truth and righteouſneſs ſhall uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſally prevail; and the Redeemer's kingdom come with power, and fill the whole earth.</p>
