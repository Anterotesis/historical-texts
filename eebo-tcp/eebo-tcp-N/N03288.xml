            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <hi>Tyre</hi> was a <hi>Gentile City</hi> of great <hi>Antiquity,</hi> and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nown for <hi>Trade</hi> and Wealth, ſcituate on the <hi>Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diterranean Sea,</hi> near to the Lot of the Tribe of <hi>Aſher.</hi> It was built by ſome Colony of the <hi>Zidonians,</hi> and is therefore in our Context called <hi>the Daughter of Zidon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon</hi>'s time we find the <hi>Tyrians</hi> faithful Allies and Friends of <hi>Iſrael.</hi> And as one well obſerves, <q>Trading Cities ſeldom prove dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous Enemies to their Neighbours; for they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and maintain their Grandeur, not by the Conqueſt of others, but by Commerce with them.</q>
            </p>
            <p>The Inhabitants of <hi>Tyre</hi> were now grown the moſt skilful in <hi>Sea Affairs</hi> of any in the World. A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the ninth Year of <hi>Hezekiah, Salmanezer</hi> the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> invaded and beſieged them both by Sea and Land. By Sea they beat the <hi>Aſſyrian and Phaenician Fleet</hi> of ſixty Sail, with <hi>twelve</hi> Ships only. This gave 'em a Name for <hi>War</hi> as well as Riches, and made 'em the Terror of the Ocean. The <hi>Aſſyrian Army</hi> then block'd 'em up by Land; for <hi>Old Tyre</hi> was built upon the <hi>Continent,</hi> and the <hi>new City</hi> after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward upon an <hi>Iſland;</hi> which <hi>Siege</hi> they bare for five Years, and were at laſt delivered by the Death of <hi>Salmanezer.</hi> Upon this Succeſs they were puff'd up with new Pride, and grew hau'tier than ever, which provoked the <hi>Holy God</hi> to utter the <hi>Burden</hi> and Prophecy againſt them, in the <hi>Chapter</hi> before us, wherein is foretold, 1. The miſerable <hi>Overthrow</hi> of the <hi>Tyrians</hi> by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> and the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Army; and 2. Their <hi>Reſtoration,</hi> like their Nei'bours the <hi>Jews,</hi> after <hi>ſeventy</hi> Years; when they ſhould recover their ancient <hi>Liberty, Trade</hi> &amp; <hi>Riches</hi> again — This is the Danger and Miſery of Places of <hi>Commerce,</hi> that as they grow rich and <hi>opulent</hi> they

               <hi>Such was Tyre</hi> when at the End of 70 Years ſhe recovered Freedom, Trade and Riches. She did all ſhe could to <hi>allure</hi> the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of the Nations to her again; the <hi>Tyrians</hi> were as much ſet upon worldly Gains, were as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinate

This is the <hi>Harlotry</hi> here imputed to her, an <hi>inordinate Luſt</hi> after Riches, and Pleaſure in it; which in <hi>Scripture</hi> is called ſpiritual <hi>Fornication.</hi> And accordingly the <hi>Prophet</hi> goes on to brand and expoſe <hi>Tyre</hi> for her Love of Money, v. 16. "<hi>Take an Harp and go about the City, thou Harlot that haſt been forgotten! make ſweet Melody, ſing many Songs that thou mayſt be remembred.</hi> Nothing can be more <hi>elegant</hi> than this predicting" the <hi>various Artifices</hi> and even <hi>diſhoneſt Practices,</hi> whereby the City of <hi>Tyre</hi> regain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her Liberty, would return into her <hi>wonted</hi> Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce with <hi>all</hi> the Nations, and <hi>entice</hi> the <hi>Merchants</hi> of the Earth into their uſual Dealings with her.

The <hi>High Prieſt</hi> of God, in his <hi>Attire</hi> of Holineſs and Glory, on the <hi>great and ſolemn Day,</hi> wore no more <hi>ſacred Inſcription</hi> than this was! yet <hi>this</hi> ſhall be written on the <hi>Merchandiſe of Tyre!</hi> marvellous <hi>Word!</hi> written for the Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons <hi>to come,</hi> and that <hi>the People to be created ſhould praiſe the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>when</hi> was this to be? and <hi>wherein</hi> ſhould it be ſo? — Why, In the Day when <hi>Tyre,</hi> and other <hi>Nations,</hi> ſhould come, 1. <hi>Not to treaſure up</hi> their Gains, from a Spirit of Covetouſneſs, or of Ambi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Pride, or of Confidence in their Riches; but 2. when their Gains by Trade ſhould be devo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to <hi>God's Honour</hi> and employ'd in <hi>his Service,</hi> in Works of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Charity;</hi> for the Eſtabliſhment and Support of the <hi>Houſe and Worſhip</hi> of God, and for the Relief of <hi>his Poor:</hi> for ſufficient and durable <hi>Food</hi> and <hi>Clothing</hi> for the <hi>Paſtors</hi> and the <hi>Poor</hi> of Chriſt's Flocks.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>was there ever</hi> ſuch a Time as this, for <hi>New Tyre?</hi> and <hi>when</hi> was it? — I anſwer, There were ſuch Times; and <hi>two Periods</hi> may probably be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferr'd to;</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Time of <hi>Judah's Return out of Babylon,</hi> when tho' the <hi>ſeventy</hi> Years of <hi>Tyre</hi> were not quite expired, yet <hi>new Tyre</hi> had attained more than <hi>fifty</hi> Years Growth, and was able to furniſh the <hi>Jews</hi> toward and aſſiſt them in their <hi>rebuilding of the City</hi> and their <hi>ſecond Temple.</hi> The <hi>Tyrians</hi> actually did this, partly <hi>in Obedience to the Edict of Cyrus,</hi> to whom they were ſubject, and partly from Intereſt
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004002_0020_10037EEF84BCF3A0"/>and Inclination, having been Fellow-Sufferers with and in the Captivity of <hi>Judah</hi> Accordingly we read in <hi>the Book of Ezra,</hi> of <hi>Meat and Drink, and Oil given to them of Zidon and of Tyre, to bring Cedar-Trees from Lebanon to the Sea of Joppa; according to the Grant by the Hand of Cyrus King of Perſia.</hi> Chap iii. 7. So early was the Merchandiſe of <hi>new Tyre</hi> Holineſs to the Lord, for the rebuilding of his <hi>Temple,</hi> and for the furniſhing of his <hi>Prieſts and Worſhipers.</hi> And it is greatly to be obſerved to the Honour of the <hi>Tyrians,</hi> That as the <hi>Fathers</hi> in old <hi>Tyre</hi> had a ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial Hand in Materials for building the <hi>firſt</hi> Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, ſo had their <hi>Poſterity</hi> in the <hi>ſecond.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But <hi>ſecondly,</hi> The <hi>Prophecy</hi> in my <hi>Text</hi> looks to be ſure to ſome Time <hi>long after</hi> the Return of the <hi>Jews</hi> from <hi>Babylon;</hi> even <hi>to the Days of the Meſſiah</hi> and the <hi>Converſion</hi> of ſome in <hi>Tyre</hi> by the <hi>preached Goſpel.</hi> The Prophecy plainly ſuppoſes that <hi>Tyre</hi> would for a <hi>long</hi> Term of Years return into her <hi>old</hi> Courſe and Way of living, and continue <hi>Pagan;</hi> tho' in a Way of <hi>Trade</hi> it might be <hi>friendly to the Jews</hi> their Nei'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours. In this there was little or <hi>no</hi> Religion; their <hi>Idol</hi> Gain and worldly Wealth was ſerved in it. But in the Day of the <hi>Converſion of the Nations</hi> to the Chriſtian Faith, <hi>Tyre</hi> alſo received the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel. And then it was that her Merchandiſe and Hire became <hi>Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> being uſed by a Number of Gods choſen and called there in the Services of <hi>true Religion and Godlineſs,</hi> the Support of his Worſhip, Miniſters and Poor.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Nehemiah</hi>'s Time we read of the <hi>Men of Tyre dwelling at Jeruſalem,</hi> and we may ſuppoſe from that Time to the Day of <hi>Chriſt</hi> many a Gift and Offering from <hi>Tyre</hi> to the Altar of God at <hi>Jeruſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem;</hi> wherein the Words of <hi>David</hi> in the xlv <hi>Pſalm</hi> might be fulfilled, as they doubtleſs were in his <hi>own</hi> Day; "<hi>The Daughter of Tyre ſhall be there with a Gift.</hi>

               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:004002_0021_10037F8C98BCA058"/>
In <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s Time we find many of <hi>Tyre</hi> and <hi>Zidon</hi> better diſpoſed to have received <hi>Him</hi> and his <hi>Goſpel</hi> than the Men of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> for if <hi>his mighty Works had been done among them they would have repented in Duſt and Aſhes.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Days and <hi>Acts</hi> of the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> we find <hi>Chriſtians</hi> at <hi>Tyre,</hi> Chap xxi. 3, 5. with whom <hi>Paul tarried ſeven Days,</hi> and who <hi>thro' the Spirit</hi> warn'd him of his <hi>Danger</hi> and Sufferings if he went up to <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and when he departed from them <hi>they bro't him on his Way with their Wives and Children,</hi> ſo reverend and fervent was their <hi>Love</hi> to him for the Goſpels ſake, <hi>till he was out of the City,</hi> where <hi>they kneeled down on the Shore and prayed, and took Leave one of another.</hi> After this <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> flouriſhed in this <hi>trading City,</hi> and then her <hi>Merchandiſe</hi> became <hi>devoted,</hi> in part, to the Worſhip and Glory of <hi>Chriſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that we plainly find in my <hi>Text,</hi> 1. A Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of the <hi>Converſion of the Tyrians.</hi> 2. How they ſhould then <hi>uſe their Wealth;</hi> that it would be <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecrated to God</hi> in pious Uſes, and <hi>holy</hi> to his Worſhip. 3. This <hi>Spirit</hi> and Example of the <hi>Tyrians</hi> is for the Learning and <hi>Imitation</hi> of other Places, Cities and Countrys, among the <hi>Gentiles.</hi> Let the Chriſtians of <hi>Tyre</hi> teach us, that where ever the Goſpel is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived, in the <hi>Love and Power</hi> of it, it will bring forth <hi>this good Fruit;</hi> the Merchandiſe and Hire of the People <hi>will be</hi> Holineſs to the Lord. <q>So <hi>Chriſtians</hi> ſhould uſe their Eſtates in the Service of God, and unto <hi>pious Uſes,</hi> and count that beſt laid <hi>up,</hi> which is ſo laid <hi>out.</hi> Both the Merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diſe of the Men in <hi>Trade,</hi> and the Hire of the Men of <hi>Labour,</hi> ſhould be devoted to God. The <hi>Tythe</hi> was ſo under the <hi>Law,</hi> and there is a <hi>Due</hi> (and ſurely an <hi>equal</hi> one) under the <hi>Goſpel.</hi>
               </q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>New Tyre</hi> has the Honour of teaching us <hi>this</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the <hi>New Teſtament;</hi> and in all Places of the

                   facs="unknown:004002_0022_10035EB1EEA6A850"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>World, thro' all Ages, the <hi>Goſpel</hi> is to be thus ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noured. As it is written, Zech. xiv. 20. <hi>In that Day there ſhall be upon the Bells of the Horſes Holineſs unto the Lord; yea every Pot in Jeruſalem and in Judah ſhall be Holineſs to the Lord of Hoſts.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here let me <hi>pauſe</hi> and obſerve to you, <hi>The Advantage that trading Places have beyond others by their Merchandiſe and Commerce;</hi> and the <hi>Obligation</hi> they are under to <hi>improve</hi> their Advantages, <hi>for getting and propagating the ſaving Knowledge and Worſhip of God.</hi> This was <hi>Tyre's</hi> Happineſs and Benefit by her Situation for <hi>Traffic.</hi> She was much the more known to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and knew ſo much the more of <hi>her God and Worſhip,</hi> than other Places. Her <hi>Merchandiſe</hi> put her in the Way hereof. Many a Man of <hi>Tyre</hi> went a trading to <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> and heard of the <hi>true God,</hi> his Law to and his Works for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſaw his <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> the Order and Worſhip of his Houſe.</p>
            <p>Many of the <hi>Jews</hi> alſo were led to <hi>Tyre</hi> by their Trade, where they accidentally ſpake of the <hi>Lord God</hi> of their Fathers, his Worſhip, Laws and Works. Other Places it may be took up ſtrange and odd Notions of that <hi>ſeparate People,</hi> as a ſingular ſort of Folk; but the <hi>Tyrians</hi> ſaw they were <hi>a wiſe and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding People,</hi> had <hi>Statutes and Judgments moſt righteous,</hi> and excelled other Places in Sobriety and Juſtice as well as in Devotion. And who knows what Influence this might have on that Degree of <hi>Union,</hi> which there was between <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> and <hi>Tyre</hi> in the Days of <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Solomon?</hi> 1 Kings v. 6. <hi>My Servants ſhall be with thy Servants.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But this we know, That <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> has been greatly ſerv'd by Trade and <hi>Merchandiſe,</hi> by means whereof a great Part of the World has been <hi>goſpeliſed.</hi>
               <pb n="11" facs="unknown:004002_0023_10037F988BE10BD0"/>For the Knowledge of Chriſt has been <hi>propagated</hi> by Trade far and near. The <hi>Earth</hi> and <hi>Sea</hi> have thus help'd the <hi>Church,</hi> and as <hi>Daniel</hi> foretold it would be, <hi>Many have run to and fro'</hi> (croſs the Ocean) <hi>and Knowledge has been increaſed.</hi> God has us'd the <hi>Loadſtone</hi> and the <hi>Mariners Art</hi> in the Service of Chriſt, and <hi>the Ends of the Earth have ſeen his Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And to add yet one more Benefit of <hi>Commerce;</hi> it <hi>enlarges</hi> Peoples Hearts to do <hi>generous</hi> Things, for the Support of Divine Worſhip and Relief of the Poor. We always ſee moſt of this in Places of Trade. And ſo it has been from the firſt Days of <hi>Tyre,</hi> of whom we read, "<hi>The Daughter of Tyre ſhall be there with a Gift:</hi> She <hi>firſt</hi> and more <hi>free</hi> of her Gifts than others. This is moſt natural to Places of <hi>Commerce;</hi> Something to give and a Heart to give. May it be always found ſo in <hi>trading</hi> Places! but eſpecially we wiſh them a Heart to make the <hi>beſt</hi> Gift, <hi>Themſelves</hi> with their Eſtates, and this in the beſt <hi>Manner;</hi> as the Churches of <hi>Macedonia</hi> are celebrated for ever for doing, 2 Cor. viii. 1,—5. <hi>The Riches of whoſe Liberality abounded in their deep Poverty,</hi> praying the Apoſtles <hi>with much Entreaty that they would accept the Gift, and take upon them the Fellow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of miniſtring to the Saints; firſt giving their own Selves to the Lord, and then to</hi> the Apoſtles <hi>by the Will of God.</hi> "When Converts <hi>joyn themſelves to the Church</hi> then they come <hi>with a Gift,</hi> devoting their <hi>Seed and Subſtance</hi> together with their Perſons, Gifts and Powers, to his Service and Glory.</p>
            <p>It is high Time I now come to the <hi>Doctrine</hi> which my <hi>Text</hi> leads me to enlarge on, which is,</p>
            <p>"<hi>That the Merchandiſe and Hire of a People, their Trade and worldly Buſineſs, their Gains and Riches, ſhould be Holineſs to the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:004002_0024_10037F9B5BE32130"/>
The <hi>Enquiries</hi> under this <hi>Doctrine</hi> muſt be 1. Into the <hi>Meaning</hi> of the Phraſe, <hi>Holineſs to the Lord.</hi> 2. When the <hi>Traffic and Wealth</hi> of a People may be ſo called? 3. <hi>Why</hi> it muſt be ſo?</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Meaning of this <hi>Phraſe, Holineſs to the Lord</hi> muſt be look'd into. And the <hi>firſt</hi> time that we find it us'd, than <hi>which</hi> there could not have been found any more <hi>eminent,</hi> was the <hi>Divine Order</hi> concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>High Prieſts Veſtments,</hi> his <hi>Garments for Glory and Beauty,</hi> wherein <hi>he</hi> was to approach before the <hi>Lord,</hi> and miniſter unto Him upon the <hi>moſt ſolemn Occaſions:</hi> Exodus xxviii. 36, 37, 38. <hi>Thou ſhalt make a Plate of pure Gold, and grave upon it like the Ingravings of a Signet, Holineſs to the Lord: And thou ſhalt put it on a blue Lace, that it may be upon the Mitre, upon the Fore-front thereof; upon Aaron's Forehead, that he may bear the Iniquity of the Holy Things which the Children of Iſrael ſhall hallow in all their Holy Gifts; And it ſhall be always upon his Forehead, that they may be accepted be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now we may obſerve in this firſt Appointment of this <hi>Title</hi> &amp; <hi>Inſcription,</hi> that it plainly was meant to ſignify, 1. The infinite Holineſs of the <hi>God of Iſrael,</hi> and of <hi>Chriſt</hi> the <hi>great High Prieſt of our Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion.</hi> 2. The Holineſs of the <hi>Prieſthood and Miniſterial Office,</hi> their ſpecial <hi>Conſecration</hi> to holy Miniſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and their ſpecial <hi>Obligations</hi> to be <hi>Holy</hi> to the Lord. 3. The <hi>Holineſs of God's Worſhip,</hi> and that all his People muſt take Care to be very <hi>holy</hi> in all their Approaches to Him, in all the <hi>Inſtitutions</hi> of his Worſhip. Pſalm xcix. <hi>The Lord is great in Zion, and high above all People: Let them praiſe thy great and ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible Name, for it is Holy; Exalt the Lord our God, and worſhip at his holy Hill; for the Lord our God is Holy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:004002_0025_10035EBC28057FA8"/>
So that in this <hi>Title Holineſs to the Lord</hi> we have 1. the Holineſs of <hi>God:</hi> 2. a <hi>Conſecration</hi> to Him, or the Separation of a Perſon or Thing to <hi>holy Uſes:</hi> 3. <hi>Actual Uſe</hi> and Imployment therein: and 4. in a ſpecial <hi>Relation</hi> to his <hi>Worſhip.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Holineſs to the Lord</hi> ſuppoſes, and in the higheſt manner declares, as <hi>in ſhining Capitals of Gold,</hi> the infinite, unutterable, incomparable, inconceivable <hi>Holineſs of Jehovah, the only true God;</hi> that He is the <hi>Holy One,</hi> and <hi>alone</hi> Holy, <hi>glorious</hi> in Holineſs, the <hi>thrice</hi> Holy; and there is <hi>none</hi> Holy like Him or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide Him. This is his <hi>Glory</hi> in both <hi>Teſtaments</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">Iſaiah vi. 1, 2, 3. Revel. iv. 8, 9.</note>, in his <hi>Temple</hi> above and in that below: "<hi>I ſaw the Lord ſitting upon a Throne, high and lifted up, and his Train filled the Temple: Above it ſtood the Seraphims, covering their Faces, and One cried unto Another and ſaid, Holy, Holy, Holy is the Lord of Hoſts! the whole Earth is full of his Glory.</hi> And if the bleſſed <hi>God</hi> were not Himſelf thus <hi>Holy,</hi> why and how ſhould Perſons and Things be called <hi>Holineſs</hi> unto <hi>Him.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">2. It ſpeaks a <hi>Conſecration</hi> of Perſons and Things to God, a <hi>ſeparation</hi> of them to his more immediate Service and Glory, to be of holy <hi>Uſe</hi> according to his Will. So <hi>Aaron</hi> and the <hi>Prieſthood</hi> were of old ſeparated and devoted to God, and therefore had <hi>this Name</hi> written on them, <hi>Holineſs to the Lord.</hi> So the <hi>Sabbath</hi> is conſecrated Time, and in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> called <hi>Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> Exod. xxxi. 15. In like manner the very <hi>Fruit of the Trees in the fourth Year were holy to praiſe the Lord withal:</hi> Levit. xix. 24. The Hebrew Word is <hi>Holineſs;</hi> being given to the <hi>Prieſts</hi> and to the <hi>Poor.</hi> And the ſame is ſaid of the <hi>Veſſels</hi> of Silver and Gold, Braſs and Iron, in <hi>Jerioo.</hi>
               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:004002_0026_10037FA82475C550"/>Joſh. vi. 19. Thus <hi>Iſrael was Holineſs to the Lord</hi> (Jer. ii. 3) by the Covenant of <hi>Circumciſion,</hi> their Dedication to God therein; and in like Manner do all <hi>Chriſtian People</hi> by their <hi>Baptiſmal Dedication</hi> to God wear the ſame Words, as on their <hi>Foreheads.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">But moreover, 3. <hi>Holineſs to God</hi> imports the <hi>actual Uſe and Improvement</hi> of Perſons and Things in the <hi>Service</hi> of God and to his <hi>Glory.</hi> When <hi>Aaron</hi> put on his <hi>Mitre</hi> it was actually to <hi>officiate</hi> before the Lord. He was then in a more ſpecial manner to intend, deſign and act for, the ſanctifying God's Name in holy Miniſtrations. <hi>De facto</hi> there was <hi>Holineſs to the Lord</hi> in his right Diſpoſitions, and Diſcharge of his Office: Elſe the Prieſthood and Worſhippers <hi>profaned the Holineſs of the Lord which be loved.</hi> Mal. ii. 11. Otherwiſe, <hi>in their ſet Office</hi> ("in the Diſcharge of their Office to which they were <hi>ſet apart"</hi>) <hi>they ſanctified themſelves in Holineſs.</hi> 2 Chron. xxxi. 18. Then, and <hi>then</hi> only, were they <hi>Holineſs</hi> to the Lord, in <hi>Deed</hi> and in <hi>Truth.</hi> And ſo are we to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> if we are holy in Heart and Life; if we <hi>live to Him in all holy Converſation,</hi> as in our <hi>Baptiſm</hi> we have bound our Selves.</p>
            <p n="4">4. And laſtly, This <hi>Motto, Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> has a more particular Regard to the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of God, his <hi>Miniſtry</hi> and <hi>Sanctuary,</hi> his <hi>Ordinances</hi> and <hi>Inſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutions.</hi> So <hi>Iſrael</hi> as Worſhippers, and <hi>Aaron</hi> as a Prieſt, and the <hi>Sabbath</hi> as the Day of weekly Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, and the <hi>Firſt-fruits</hi> as offered in Worſhip, were dignified with this <hi>Style</hi> of Holy to the Lord. So when <hi>we</hi> by the Grace of God devote, uſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy <hi>our</hi> Souls and Bodies, our Gifts and Powers, our Time and Eſtate, in the Services of Religion, and for promoting his Worſhip, they become <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Lord.</hi> We become in our <hi>Perſons</hi> as
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004002_0027_10037FAE8B7BDD78"/>
               <hi>Temples of the living God,</hi> and God is <hi>ſanctified in us</hi> as in them <hi>that draw nigh to Him;</hi> and our <hi>Powers</hi> of Mind and Body, with the <hi>Fruit</hi> of our Bodies, our <hi>Time</hi> and <hi>Eſtate,</hi> our <hi>Intereſt</hi> in the World and our <hi>Influence</hi> among Men, are as ſo many <hi>Offerings</hi> to God at his <hi>Altar,</hi> which <hi>conſecrates</hi> the Gifts.</p>
            <p>Having thus enquired into the <hi>Meaning</hi> of the Phraſe <hi>Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> I come new to enquire,</p>
            <p n="2">II. <hi>When</hi> the <hi>Traffic and Wealth, Merchandiſe and Buſineſs</hi> of a Perſon or People may be ſo called? To which I anſwer in <hi>three</hi> general Heads,</p>

            </p>
            <p>I Then is our <hi>Merchandiſe and Trade,</hi> Wealth and worldly Buſineſs, <hi>Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> when we ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riouſly <hi>devote, dedicate and conſecrate,</hi> a due Part of our <hi>Subſtance,</hi> together with <hi>our Selves,</hi> to the <hi>Glory and Service of God.</hi>

Neither will the Eſtate do without the <hi>Perſon,</hi> all his Heart and all his Soul; nor the Perſon do (if that could be) without the <hi>Eſtate,</hi> for it will go with the Heart and Love. — But I prevent my ſelf on the <hi>ſecond</hi> Anſwer to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiry I am upon:</p>
            <p n="2">II. Our Merchandiſe and Wealth is <hi>Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> when what is conſecrated and devoted out of our <hi>Eſtate,</hi> is actually <hi>uſed</hi> and imployed in the <hi>Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> of God, according to his <hi>Will. "When thou voweſt a Vow, defer not to pay; why ſhould God be an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gry at thy Voice<note n="*" place="bottom">Eccleſ. v. 4, 5, 6. Pſalm lxxvi. 11,</note>?

            </p>
            <p>It is to be feared that many <hi>Chriſtians</hi> do not eno' apprehend and conſider, that their <hi>worldly Eſtate</hi> enters into their <hi>general Vow,</hi> and is always a Part of it, in their <hi>Self-Dedication</hi> to God. But God's Part is <hi>holy to Him</hi> whether we conſider it or no; and if we render Him his Part, the <hi>whole</hi> is ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied unto us. There is not <hi>Holineſs to God</hi> written
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004002_0031_10037FC4FA63E040"/>on our Perſons, Faculties and Powers, nor on our Eſtate, till both one and the other are <hi>uſed</hi> to holy Ends and Purpoſes, in actual Miniſtrations to the Glory of God. But if we are actually honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring God with our whole Man, Soul and Body, the Powers of the one, and the Endowments of the other, the <hi>Spirit of the Living God</hi> dwells and rules in us, and has <hi>graven on us,</hi> as in Letters of Gold, <hi>Holineſs</hi> to Himſelf. And if we are <hi>honouring the Lord with our Subſtance, and with the Firſt-fruits of our Increaſe,</hi> we may <hi>read</hi> with Pleaſure the ſame <hi>Inſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> on our <hi>Eſtates,</hi> &amp; others may <hi>ſee</hi> it on us. 2 Cor. iii. 2. <hi>Ye are our Epiſtle written in our Hearts, known and read of all Men: Ye are manifeſtly declared to be the Epiſtle of Chriſt, miniſtred by us, written not with Ink, but with the Spirit of the Living God; not in Tables of Stone, but in fleſhly Tables of the Heart.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now if it be ask'd, <hi>Wherein</hi> a Part of our worldly Eſtate is to be <hi>us'd</hi> to the Glory of God? it is eaſily anſwer'd in the <hi>two</hi> general and known <hi>Inſtances,</hi> Works of <hi>Piety</hi> and <hi>Charity.</hi> The <hi>firſt</hi> is the very <hi>Thing</hi> in my Text, and the <hi>other is like unto it,</hi> and never to be ſeparated; the <hi>firſt</hi> is a more direct Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Love to <hi>God,</hi> the <hi>other</hi> to our <hi>Neibour;</hi> on which <hi>two hang all the Law and the Prophets,</hi> and conſequently the whole of <hi>Holineſs to the Lord</hi> is contained in them.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Firſt</hi> then, Our <hi>Wealth</hi> and worldly Buſineſs is <hi>Holineſs</hi> to the Lord, when with a true and right Heart it is uſed and imployed in <hi>Works of Piety to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward God, for the Support of his Worſhip.</hi> When it is <hi>for them that dwell before the Lord to eat ſufficiently, and for durable Clothing.</hi> That is to ſay, When Men make Conſcience of giving unto God a due Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion out of their Eſtates for the Support of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion</hi>

            <p>When People expend prudently and piouſly for the ſetting up, and carrying on, the <hi>Worſhip</hi> of God where they live, or in other Places; or in ſending the Goſpel to People deſtitute thereof, and periſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for lack of Knowledge; and in making Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for a more private Inſtruction of Children in ſuch Places; their Wealth in this <hi>Uſe</hi> of it becomes <hi>Holineſs to the Lord.</hi> It comes into a <hi>Relation</hi> to di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Worſhip, even as <hi>Aaron</hi> and the <hi>Holy Things</hi> of old belonging to the <hi>Tabernacle.</hi>—But unto ſuch Works of <hi>Piety</hi> for the Support of God's <hi>Worſhip,</hi> we muſt add</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> Works of <hi>Charity and Mercy,</hi> which are as much in themſelves, and render us as much, <hi>Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004002_0033_10035ECC429E9FB0"/>to the Lord,</hi> as the other.

They are the Lords <hi>Receivers</hi> as well as his Prieſts, and we have them <hi>always with us.</hi> And the <hi>pious poor</hi> are among his <hi>ſpiritual Prieſts,</hi> rich in Faith, choſen of God and <hi>called.</hi> He that gives to them, for their comfortable Eating and Clothing, with a right and charitable Frame of Spirit, <hi>lends to the Lord, and honours Him with his Subſtance.</hi> Theſe are ſpiritual <hi>Sacrifices</hi> with which God is <hi>well pleaſed.</hi> There is Worſhip and <hi>Incenſe,</hi> an <hi>Odour of a ſweet Smell</hi> in them, as well as in Offerings at the <hi>Altar</hi> of God. The <hi>Alms</hi> of Believers go up for <hi>a Memo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial</hi> before God, with their <hi>Prayers;</hi> as did thoſe of <hi>Cornelius.</hi> The <hi>Great High Prieſt,</hi> at the <hi>Golden Altar</hi> within the <hi>Vail,</hi> preſents the one and the other in the <hi>Cloud of Incenſe,</hi> his own Merits &amp; Interceſſion. <hi>He,</hi> the <hi>Holy One</hi> of God, was <hi>Holineſs to the Lord</hi> above all the Sons of Men; and his Miracles of <hi>Mercy</hi> were like his Prayers and Devotions beyond number, and alike honorary to God. God will have <hi>his poor</hi> fed, as well as his <hi>Miniſters.</hi> And why not? are they not together <hi>Heirs of his Kingdom?</hi> and has he not put them together again and again, the <hi>Levite</hi> and the <hi>Poor</hi>

            </p>
            <p>But give me leave more <hi>particularly</hi> to prove, by three or four <hi>Arguments,</hi> that Works of <hi>Charity to the poor</hi> are proper <hi>Holineſs to the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. They are <hi>Obedience to the Law of God</hi> which is moſt holy. The <hi>Word</hi> of God is the Rule of Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs,
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004002_0034_10035F4AE09F22A0"/>and one of its grand Rules and Laws to us is <hi>Alms-deeds,</hi> and acts of Charity. Theſe are an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minent Branch of that <hi>Holineſs</hi> which the Lord re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quires, Zech. vii. 9. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord, Shew Mercy every one to his Brother.</hi> Only let what we do be done in Obedience to God, for his Glory, and with a pure Reſpect to his Will, not <hi>to be ſeen of Men;</hi> ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving true <hi>Compaſſion one of another, loving as Brethren, pitiful, courteous, tender-hearted</hi>
               <note n="‖" place="bottom">Matth. vi. 1. 1 Pet. iii. 8. Epheſ. iv. 32.</note>; otherwiſe there is no <hi>Holineſs</hi> to the Lord, nor <hi>Reward</hi> from our <hi>Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther that is in Heaven.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To give to the <hi>poor</hi> out of our Eſtates is <hi>Holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the Lord,</hi> becauſe it is <hi>our Conformity to God and Chriſt in their Bounties and Mercies to the indigent and miſerable.</hi> Conformity to the Holy God is <hi>Holineſs,</hi> but <hi>Compaſſion</hi> and Mercy to the poor is Confor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity to God; <hi>who maketh his Sun to riſe and his Rain to fall on the evil and on the good; Be ye therefore per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect as your Father in Heaven is perfect.</hi> Mat. v. 45, 48. So <hi>Chriſt</hi> approved Himſelf to be the <hi>Holy One</hi> in the Days of his Fleſh, by filling up his Life with Acts of <hi>God-like Charity and Mercy.</hi> They <hi>cried after Him,</hi> laid themſelves in his Way, <hi>and he healed them all.</hi> This was <hi>Holineſs to his Father,</hi> and in the Sight of Men, and we ſhould lay up in our Hearts his me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morable Words, Acts xx. 35. <hi>It is more bleſſed to give than to receive.</hi>

            <p n="3">3. A right and charitable Diſpoſition is <hi>the Fruit of the Holy Spirit</hi> in us, &amp; therefore can be no other than <hi>Holineſs to the Lord. "The Fruit of the Spirit is Love</hi>

III. Always provided that what we ſo devote and uſe <hi>is acouired honeſtly and righteouſly</hi> in the <hi>Fear</hi> of God and in his <hi>Way;</hi> and is <hi>given</hi> by us <hi>with a ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Mind, Heart and Affection.</hi>

            <p n="1">1.

            <p>
               <hi>Firſt,</hi> Our <hi>Dependence</hi> muſt be on God for his <hi>Bleſſing</hi> to make our lawful Endeavours proſperous; For it is the Bleſſing of God <hi>that makes rich,</hi> and it is <hi>He</hi> that <hi>gives us Power to get Wealth;</hi> it is therefore <hi>prophane and unholy</hi> to act in our worldly Buſineſs but with a Dependance on the Governing and over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruling Providence of a wiſe and Sovereign God: James iv. 14. <hi>Go to now you that ſay, To Day or to Morrow we will</hi> be here or there, do this or that, and <hi>make Gain; Whereas ye ought to ſay, If the Lord will</hi> we ſhall do ſo.

            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Secondly,</hi> We muſt daily commit our worldly Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs to God in <hi>Prayer,</hi> and more eſpecially at Times our more important Concerns and Intereſts.

We pray <q>that of God's free Gift we may receive a competent Portion of the good Things of this Life, and enjoy his Bleſſing with them.</q> It is greatly for the Glory of God, and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004002_0039_10035ED97655FD08"/>for our temporal Intereſt and daily Comfort that we daily pray for God's gracious Direction to us in, and for his Bleſſing on our worldly Buſineſs: "<hi>That the Lord thy God may bleſs Thee in all the Works of thy Hand.</hi> So <hi>Iſaac</hi> pray'd for his Son, "<hi>God give Thee of the Dew of Heaven, and the Fulneſs of the Earth, and Plenty of Corn and Wine.</hi> And ſo <hi>Jacob</hi> prayed for himſelf, "<hi>If God will be with me in the Way I go, and give me Bread to eat.</hi> And ſo <hi>Moſes</hi> for the Tribe of <hi>Levi, "Bleſs, Lord, his Subſtance:</hi> The <hi>leſs</hi> it is, the more <hi>need</hi> to pray over it; for the Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing of God can make a <hi>little</hi> go far.

            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly,</hi> We muſt keep from <hi>every ſinful &amp; wicked Way</hi> in our worldly Acquiſitions and Enjoyments, and govern our Selves by the holy Laws of <hi>Juſtice and Righteouſneſs, Sobriety and Temperance,</hi> and uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſal <hi>Obedience</hi> to the Divine <hi>Law.</hi> Elſe all is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holy and unclean, and we forfeit God's Bleſſing and provoke his Curſe. It is only ſincere, hearty, univerſal and perſevering <hi>Obedience</hi> to the holy Commandments of the Lord our God, that will render us holy and acceptable in his Sight. Deut. xxviii. 1, 2, 3. <q>

               <hi>Fourthly,</hi> In Caſe a Perſon have acquired Riches in <hi>any unjuſt and unrighteous Manner,</hi> by <hi>Deceit and Fraud,</hi> or by <hi>Extortion and Oppreſſion;</hi> he muſt make <hi>his Peace with God by Repentance,</hi> with deep <hi>Humilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> before Him for his Wickedneſs; and if it be in his Power he muſt make <hi>Reſtitution;</hi> which if he cannot do to the <hi>Perſons wronged</hi> let him do it to the <hi>poor,</hi> beſeeching God to <hi>pardon</hi> him for <hi>Chriſt</hi>'s ſake and accept his Offering; and then his <hi>Merchandiſe</hi> and his <hi>Charities</hi> ſhall be yet <hi>Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding his paſt <hi>Unrighteouſneſs</hi> and Sin. See the Caſe of <hi>Zaccheus,</hi> Luke xix. 8. <hi>And Zaccheus ſtood and ſaid before the Lord,</hi> 
               <q>
                  <hi>Behold, Lord, the half of my Goods give I to the poor; and if I have taken any Thing from any Man by falſe Accuſation, I reſtore him four-fold: And Jeſus ſaid unto him, This Day is Salvation come to this Houſe.</hi>
               </q> "When true Faith, Repentance and new Obedience comes to a Houſe, <hi>Salvation</hi> comes to it, however great the Sins of it had been before. <hi>Zaccheus</hi> had been a <hi>Publican</hi> and an Extortioner, exacting more than was his right. "Thoſe <hi>Publicans</hi> had the Ear of the <hi>Roman Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours,</hi> and by a falſe Account of Perſons and Things could eaſily be injurious.

And having thus ſaid, <hi>When</hi> the Traffic &amp; Wealth of a People is <hi>Holineſs to the Lord,</hi> I come (as was propoſed) in the <hi>third</hi> and laſt place to enquire,</p>

            <p>I might eaſily enter into, and enlarge on, many <hi>Reaſons</hi> of this Duty, which are alſo <hi>Motives</hi> to it, and muſt pray you to give <hi>'em</hi> a juſt <hi>Conſideration,</hi> and ſo make the <hi>Application</hi> of all that has been ſaid every one to himſelf.</p>
