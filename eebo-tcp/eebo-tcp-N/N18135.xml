            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>THE preſent ſituation of your domeſtic con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns, and the fituation of public affairs in general, loudly call for your attention: It is time that you ſhould know what comforts you are to enjoy, what rights you have to defend.</p>
               <p>The laws of nature are ſufficiently promulgated by that neceſſity which has occaſioned them, by the benefit man receives in obſerving them, and the evils he ſuffers by their infraction. Governments are inſtituted to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the laws of nature, and not by the arbitrary de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crees of men to violate them. Theſe truths, although ſo obvious and ſimple, that no perſon can be ignorant of them, yet it is neceſſary that they ſhould be premiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in order to eſtabliſh the principles upon which men enter into civil ſociety.</p>
               <p>The leaſt acquaintance with the order of ſciences evidences that it is by the moſt ſimple truths that men attain the knowledge of thoſe which are leſs evident. Thus in geometry, it is neceſſary to begin by learning that the whole is greater than any of its parts, that things which are equal to the ſame are equal to one an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other, and other truths which children know, but the uſe of which is neceſſary for penetrating into other truths which are not ſo clear.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="unknown:023507_0003_0FBFCC52DA5AF6A8"/>
To diſcover the origin of government it is not neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that we ſhould have recourſe to the vague opinions of the ſcholiaſts, or to the contradictory accounts of civilians: A careful inveſtigation into the nature of man, manifeſts that it is the intention of the Creator of the world that he ſhould live in ſociety. His ſenſations, his faculties, his wants in childhood and in old age, render this ſtate neceſſary. Man thus united in ſociety, is not left to the arbitrary and capricious decrees of men; but, with every other part of the creation, has laws ordained by GOD for his government: theſe laws are ſimple and evident; they have their foundation in the reciprocal duties men owe to each other, and their rights ariſing from ſuch duties.</p>
               <p>On whatever ſide we turn our eyes, we ſee nothing in nature which is not governed by laws proper to its exiſtence, and which is not organiſed in a manner to obey ſuch laws, to acquire every ſuccour which is a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the nature of its being, or neceſſary to its mode of exiſtence, Man is not neglected by his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor; the gifts which to him are particular, and which give him the empire of the world, manifeſt that hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and proſperity are deſigned for him, and an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der proper to enſure him the enjoyment of them.— Therefore, we muſt regard ſociety as being the work of GOD himſelf, and the laws conſtituting the ſocial order as making part of the univerſal and immutable laws of the creation. In ſupport of this opinion, man is found in every part of the world connected with his fellow creatures upon principles of government more or leſs perfect, according to the ſituation of the coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, and the number of its inhabitants, where the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural produce of the earth affords a ſufficient ſupport for its few inhabitants, and the gratification of their
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:023507_0004_0FBFCC5455CD7778"/>wants does not depend on the aſſiſtance of men, but ariſes from the bountiful gifts of GOD; the ſocial tie is the weakeſt imaginable. Men depending on wild animals taken in chaſe, or on ſiſh for their ſupport, having a right in the game they take, as the juſt reward of their exertions and induſtry, and alſo in their bows and arrows, and other perſonal property, they are ſtronger united in ſociety than the laſt; but even in this ſtate, the ſociety as a body does not revenge the injuries which any individual may ſuſtain, as every man is ſuppoſed capable of defending his perſon and the ſmall property immediately connected with it.</p>
               <p>In the paſtoral life, the mark of government is ſtill ſtronger; here you have maſter and ſervant and ſome degree of ſubordination.</p>
               <p>But whenever the population of a country becomes ſo great as to render the cultivation of the ſoil neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry for the ſupport of its inhabitants, then a ſirm, eſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bliſhed government becomes equally neceſſary to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port each individual citizen in the right of ſoil, and the advantages and proſits ariſing from his labor.</p>
               <p>Conſidering Agriculture then, as forming the baſis of regular government; it is proper that every citizen engaged in this moſt honorable, and moſt uſeful em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy, ſhould be acquainted with that chain of practical truths, which conſtitutes the order of laws the moſt advantageous to men united in ſociety: Theſe are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed under regulations or ordinances, moſt favorable to the cultivation of the land, in which the intereſt of all is concerned, and to which the increaſe of every good is united.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="6" facs="unknown:023507_0005_0FBFCC5936599300"/>
Convinced of the dependence of civil ſociety upon Agriculture, and that the population, the proſperity and the happineſs of a country is in a direct ratio to the cultivation of the earth; it becomes the intereſt, it becomes the duty of the farmers of the United States, to procure a ſyſtem of laws favorable to this di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine ſcience. Under this happy ſituation of public affairs the rights and duties of men would be known: juſtice and the energy of government, would be firmly united together for the protection of the liberty of every citizen; and your property, after having once contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to the ſupport of government by an equal direct tax, would become perfectly free, without being ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to unjuſt commercial regulations.</p>
               <p>The independent yeomanry of England are almoſt annihilated, owing to a deſtructive lethargy having taken place amongſt them reſpecting their rights — The gentlemen in that country, living independent on their own eſtates, have always been duped, by men much more active and connected than themſelves, into the belief that to grant the demands of the commercial and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturing claſſes, was the beſt way of promoting their own intereſt—The farmer, after paying one tenth of the produce of his labor to the clergy, two or three more tenths to the government, and a very heavy tax for the ſupport of a numerous poor, rendered ſo by large ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacturing towns: after this weight of taxes, the free ſale of the remainder of his produce is reſtricted to ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfy the avarice of merchants and manufacturers.</p>
               <p>A freeman ſhould examine every act of government for himſelf; for, however diſintereſted, however vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuous the men intruſted with the legiſlative authority; yet if they are ignorant of the dependence of civil ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:023507_0006_0FBFCC5CF12901B8"/>upon the phyſical order of cultivation, their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration will produce nothing but arbitrary, mutable, and contradictory laws—Stateſmen and lawyers have greatly contributed to involve the rights of men as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nected in civil ſociety into a labyrinth of error, invert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the order of nature, and, in the place of eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing government upon the ſimple principles of juſtice, uſing every artifice to render the ſcience of politics im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penetrable to the people, wiſhing to attract the admira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of an ignorant populace by myſterious, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure oracles, rather than enlighten the minds of free citizens by ſubſtantial and immutable truths.</p>
               <p>Nor is it any matter of aſtoniſhment that Lawyers ſhould be ignorant of the fundamental principles of government: All the ſciences have been rendered ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure by the pretended teachers of them. The hiſtory of medicine, and of philoſophy in general, ſupport this aſſertion. Even the Chriſtian religion itſelf is ſo greatly altered from its original purity and ſimplicity, that was the holy founder of it now to appear on earth, he would ſcarcely be acknowledged by the oſtentatious profeſſors of his own doctrines. Mankind in general continue in error, becauſe the guides on whom they depend, being themſelves unacquainted with truth, are incapable of inſtructing others, and therefore only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culcate ſuch falſe principles as they are infeſted with. Knowledge muſt be acquired by experience and reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, by which means alone we are enabled to diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh ſubſtantial, permanent good, from tranſitory pleaſure.</p>
               <p>The ſcience of political economy in no inſtance is ſubject to uncertainty, but a pleaſing uniformity is diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverable in every part of it. To engage the learned
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:023507_0007_0FBFCC606B373F68"/>in the belief of a new ſcience may be difficult, and ſtill more difficult to render them ſo humble as to ſtudy its elements. Wiſdom frequently inſpires us with a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the knowledge acquired, and makes us ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picious of novelties. Men, who have dedicated great part of their lives to antient and modern learning, will not eaſily be perſuaded that the antients were ignorant of the eſſential truths of political economy; and that the moderns, who have acquired ſo much uſeful know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge in philoſophy, ſhould be unacquainted with the beſt ſyſtem of promoting the happineſs of men united in ſociety. Yet this is really the caſe, and the world is alone indebted to a few enlightened men in France for this important diſcovery.</p>
               <p>This ſubject merits your moſt ſerious attention, hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing no leſs an object in view than eſtabliſhing a govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment founded in juſtice. The ſublime ſatisfaction which you will experience in being the authors of pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good, and of ſeeing thouſands of your fellow citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens happy in living under your adminiſtration, will be your ample reward.</p>
               <p>It is to you alone that the people of the United States can look—it is to you alone that they ought to look, for protection and ſupport. Men of weak judge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and little reflection, regard the Farmers merely as laborers, who raiſe wheat or other grain for the ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of men; but they appear ignorant that it is the Farmers alone who furniſh every other claſs of citizens with the means of paving their expences, and on whoſe ſucceſs depends the proſperity of the ſtate.</p>
               <p>The neceſſity of a perfect knowledge with political economy, and the high ſtation which you hold in civil
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:023507_0008_0FBFCC61F0DA12B0"/>ſociety, ſhould engage you to dedicate part of your leiſure to the ſtudy of this ſcience—a ſcience evidently of the firſt importance, becauſe it brings us near to GOD himſelf, by engaging us to promote the general proſperity and happineſs of mankind. Removed from the noiſe and buſtle of a great city, and accuſtomed to reflection, you are well qualified to become acquainted with truth, by means of ſtrict examination.</p>
               <p>Being yourſelves convinced of the exiſtence of a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural order, intended by the Creator of the Univerſe for the purpoſe of promoting the happineſs of men united in ſociety: For you to be ſilent or inactive on this important ſubject, would be criminal. Although you may not at preſent have ſufficient influence to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſipate the thick clouds of political ignorance, with which our country is ſurrounded, or to ſtop the unjuſt meaſures of government; yet you may expect to ſee that day, when your fellow-citizens in general will be convinced of the juſtice of theſe ſalutary principles; and admitting their inſluence over every department of government, we ſhall experience a happy revolution in our laws, and in our manners, by which means our country will become the ſeat of juſtice and of peace. Experience, reflection and truth, muſt open the eyes of men, and will dictate thoſe meaſures moſt proper for them to adopt. For whenever public affairs are directed by mere opinion, they are always fluctuating, inadequate and unjuſt. Tyrants, governed by opinion, believe that their happineſs and reputation conſiſt in deſtructive wars, in parade, and in expence; and your Legiſlators, governed by mere opinion, think it neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary that the commerce of your country ſhould be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted by oppreſſive and embarraſſing regulations, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qually unjuſt and impolitic. When a people are inat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:023507_0009_0FBFCC63588D3B88"/>to the fundamental principles of their original compact, or to the conduct of thoſe men intruſted with the ſupreme power of the ſtate, they muſt expect that the proſperity and happineſs of the community will be continually ſacrificed to the ambition and avarice of a few.</p>
               <p>There are no people more ſubmiſſive to their govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment than the Chineſe, becauſe they are well inſtructed in the reciprocal duties of the ſovereign, and of the people, and are watchful that theſe duties are not vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olated on either ſide.</p>
               <p>You have hitherto been equally ſubmiſſive to your government, but you have not been equally attentive to the conduct of your officers entruſted with the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtration of it; and yet there are men among you who are anxious for a more efficient government, in order to render the people ſtill more ſubmiſſive.—Such characters ſhould reflect, that a time may come when reaſon will find the minds of our citizens diſpoſed to hear, and will determine them to do themſelves juſtice. A wiſe Legiſlature will diſtinguiſh between the appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation of their conſtituents, and the indignant ſilence or lethargy of a free people.</p>

This ſcience is ſupported by the phyſical order of cultivation, cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culated to render the ſoil the moſt productive poſſible; and by the ſacred moral principle of doing unto others as we would have others to do unto us—The firſt is neceſſary to the maintenance and exiſtence of civil ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety —the laſt, equally neceſſary to enſure its proſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity.</p>
               <p>In the propagation of this bleſſed doctrine, you muſt expect to be oppoſed by the ignorant, proud, and all thoſe indolent characters among you who are anxious for lucrative offices in government, that they may be ſupported by the labor of their fellow-citizens. You will be told by theſe wretched diſciples of Machiavel, Hobbs and Spinoſa, that the natural ſtate of man is that of a ſavage animal, perpetually at war with his fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low-creatures; that it is force alone which renders him ſubmiſſive to government; and that ſelf-intereſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly engages him to take the advantage of his neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors by force or ſtratagem—A moſt horrid ſyſtem, which authoriſes every ſpecies of outrage and injuſtice, and from the adoption of which it neceſſarily follows, that every man in civil ſociety muſt be either maſter or ſlave, oppreſſor or oppreſſed; and to preſerve himſelf from deſtruction, muſt be conſtantly employed in the ruin of others. The error of theſe men ariſes from their want of reflection, and conſequently miſtak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a momentary intereſt for a ſolid, permanent good, dictated by reaſon.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="unknown:023507_0011_0FBFCC6C82AA8A78"/>
The ſame Great Being who created man for the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of his own glory, has alſo appointed an order of conduct, calculated to conciliate the intereſts of men united in ſociety, not merely by aſſuring to each indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual his own ſafety, without uſurping the rights of others, but by making the proportion of every man's happineſs to depend upon his benevolence and ſervices to others.</p>
               <p>Men, thus united in ſociety, and forming a diſtinct government, muſt naturally wiſh that ſuch government ſhould poſſeſs great riches, great authority, and great power. The only poſſible means of acquiring this ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, depends upon a ſtrict obſervance of the phyſical order of cultivation—When the ſupreme power of the ſtate, conſidering itſelf as a partner entitled to receive only a juſt portion of the net proceeds of the land, ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cures and protects the Farmer in the free diſpoſal of the remainder.</p>
               <p>The ſovereign power which thinks it has the right of commanding, and wiſhes to enjoy the power of making itſelf obeyed, ſhould at the ſame time comply with its duty in doing nothing but for the general good of the ſociety, and ſecuring to every individual the full enjoyment of thoſe natural rights, to ſecure which men enter into civil ſociety, and put themſelves under the protection of government,</p>
               <p>The reciprocal rights and duties of the people, and of the ſovereign, conſtitutes ſubſtantial juſtice. In con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering this ſubject one point ſhould be attended to, which is, that in every government the duty of the ſovereign power, in acting conſiſtent with the ſafety of the people, always preceeds its right of demanding
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:023507_0012_0FBFCC6FF1E014E8"/>obedience; whilſt, on the contrary, between individu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als, every man's duty of ſerving his fellow-citizens, precedes his right of expecting any benefit or attention from them. The juſtice and neceſſity of theſe funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental laws muſt appear evident to every perſon in the leaſt acquainted with the ſituation of men in ſociety; they naturally ariſe from that ſituation, and owe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to legiſlative authority, or expreſs contract.</p>
               <p>An ignorance or neglect of theſe ſalutary principles of political economy, muſt occaſion the whole admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtration of that extenſive government which you have adopted, to be wavering and unjuſt; and your repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives being too far removed from the inſtructions of their conſtituents, will think that their own haſty o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pinion or caprice ſhould be the ruling principle of legiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation. But the yeomanry of the United States will certainly never ſuffer themſelves to be reduced to that abject ſtate of ſervility as to believe that thouſands of freemen ſhould be ſubject to the arbitrary opinion of the few; or that the people owe every ſubmiſſion to government, whilſt that government is only devoted to ſupport the luxury or ambition of its officers.</p>
               <p>A Legiſlature unprovided with any fixed rule of conduct in the exerciſe of its power, muſt conſtantly be ſubject to the caprice of the moment. You ſhould therefore impreſs the minds of your ſervants in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs with the juſt principles of political economy—an attention to which will guard them againſt the infatua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of power, the projects of ambition, or any falſe ideas of glory, connected with the extravagance and parade of a court. This duty is more particularly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary at a time when your country is juſt at the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of a new and important aera, and when too
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:023507_0013_0FBFCC725C876010"/>many of your fellow-citizens, infatuated with the falſe principles of the government of Great-Britain, are anxious to adopt her wretched ſyſtem of policy. To divide the intereſt of the people appears to be a funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental maxim of that government; and therefore it is conſtantly engaged in making laws to regulate its agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture, its commerce, and its manufactures; and thus, by ſacrificing the intereſts of one claſs of citizens to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>other. jealouſies and animoſities are created among them. In the place of doing ſubſtantial juſtice to her induſtrious farmers, manufacturers, and mechanics, by admitting a free diſpoſal of the produce of their labor and ingenuity, the country is overwhelmed with com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial regulations, in order to ſecure a monopoly of the carrying-trade to her own merchants, and to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port a very expenſive navy; although the real advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage of either, have never been clearly aſcertained.— From hence alſo the excluſion of ſtrangers from her ports, prohibitory impoſitions, repriſals, jealouſies of commerce, quarrels, and, in fine, the moſt deſtructive wars, to ſupport meaſures, the contrary of which would be the true intereſt of that country.</p>
               <p>Every unprejudiced citizen muſt allow, that the total freedom of commerce, without any reſtrictions what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, will be one of the principle means of promoting the proſperity of our country. In this great queſtion you ſhould take a decided part; and as you wiſh to ſupport the general intereſt of the community, you ſhould exert yourſelves to expoſe and ſuppreſs the falſe principles of thoſe men who wiſh to make their fortunes by monopolies and intrigue; and whoſe projects of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulence are ever founded upon the ruin of the people.</p>

               <head>LETTER III.</head>
               <p>THE Legiſlators of a free people, influenced by the juſt principles of political economy, will look only to the land for a ſource of revenue. Thus ſcience mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſts the truth of the following axioms, beyond the poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibility of a doubt.</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt: The earth is naturally fruitful.</p>
               <p n="2">2d. The earth is not ſufficiently productive for the ſupport of civil ſociety without cultivation.</p>
               <p n="3">3d. The earth is the only ſource of thoſe things ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to the exiſtence of men.</p>
               <p n="4">4th. The earth being the only productive fund, the cultivation of the earth is the only productive employ.</p>
               <p n="5">5th. Every other kind of work which has for its object the preparation, alteration, or tranſport of ſuch productions may be more or leſs neceſſary, but they are not productive.</p>
               <p n="6">6th. No work can be executed without expence; this expence conſiſts in the ſupport of its agents, and in the collection and preſervation of the inſtruments ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſary to ſuch work.</p>
               <p>There exiſts then two kinds of work, the one pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive —the other unproductive. They equally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the expence of ſubſiſtence, but whilſt the one is creative, the other only replaces the actual conſumption of ſubſiſtence.</p>
               <p>The cultivation of the land being the only produc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive employ, it conſequently does not merely pay the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:023507_0015_0FBFCC7DC3ADAE50"/>expence of ſubſiſtence, but alſo furniſhes a ſurplus, more or leſs conſiderable, according to the ability or independent ſituation of the Farmer.</p>
               <p>It is the intereſt of the government, and of every claſs of citizens, that this ſurplus ſhould be the greateſt poſſible.</p>
               <p>Becauſe it affords the only juſt revenue to the ſtate:</p>
               <p>Becauſe, in proportion to the net produce of the land, will be the encouragement and comfortable ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of uſeful mechanics and manufacturers:</p>
               <p>Becauſe, the greater this produce, the greater will be the employ and profit of the merchant.</p>
               <p>In fine, the whole community, from the moſt dig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nified character, to the pooreſt beggar, are all benefit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by the full cultivation of the earth.</p>
               <p>As the proſperity and happineſs of every individual in civil ſociety depends upon Agriculture; and as it is the intereſt of all, that Agriculture ſhould be the moſt productive poſſible, it is the duty of all to encourage and promote it. This muſt be accompliſhed by devot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing large ſums of money to thoſe previous expences ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to making the land fertile.</p>
               <p>The expences which are neceſſary to obtain an an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual production from the land, by cultivation, are of two ſorts: primitive expences, which conſiſt in the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſe of inſtruments of huſbandry, horſes, oxen, and other animals neceſſary on a well regulated farm; and annual expences, which conſiſts in the ſupport of the Farmer, his family, and ſtock, from one harveſt to the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:023507_0016_0FBFCC7F15C57C80"/>other: beſides which, 10 per cent. upon the primitive expences ſhould be annually deducted from the groſs produce of the farm, to replace the ſtock, inſtruments of huſbandry, &amp;c. which require renovation at leaſt every ten years.</p>
               <p>The quantity of the net produce of Agriculture de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends upon the primitive expence; when the fund is inadequate to the full cultivation of the ſoil; the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual expences of every kind being deducted leaves but a ſmall ſurplus; and therefore, the greater the fund, the better will be the cultivation, and the greater will be the profit to the farmer, and to the ſtate.</p>
               <p>The groſs produce of Agriculture naturally divides itſelf into two portions, one of which ſhould be held ſacred to diſcharge every expence neceſſary to the full cultivation of the ſoil; the remainder, forming the great maſs of wealth of the community, is diſtributed among the citizens according to their induſtry and me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. And as this ſurplus ariſing from Agriculture is the only real wealth of a government, it follows, that a nation cannot ſpend annually more than its annual income, without deſtroying itſelf. The ſubſequent works to cultivation do not multiply the riches of a ſtate, nor extend its power of ſupporting expence; they are certainly very neceſſary, and very uſeful, but they are unproductive.</p>
               <p>The quantity of the net produce ariſing from culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation depends not only upon the quantity of the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nual produce, but alſo on its value; when this is low, a greater proportion of the groſs produce is required to pay the neceſſary expences of cultivation, and therefore the ſurplus remaining muſt be ſmaller. As it is the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:023507_0017_0FBFCC80953F58A8"/>intereſt of every claſs of citizens, and of the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment itſelf, that the produce of the land ſhould be the greateſt poſſible, ſo it is equally the intereſt of all, that ſuch produce ſhould bear the greateſt poſſible price, by means of a perfect free commerce.</p>
               <p>Ambitious Stateſmen, and thoſe contemptible wretches who are ſeeking to be ſupported by the public revenue, will endeavor to perſuade you, That by impoſts laid on the neceſſaries and conveniences of life, the burthen of ſupporting your government will be more equally di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided amongſt the citizens—that ſuch taxes being op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional they are moſt conſiſtent with the independent ſpirit of freemen—and that the revenue ariſing from the conſumption of the articles taxed, the acquiring of it is attended with leſs delay and difficulty than by a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect tax.</p>
               <p>Inſtructed in the juſt principles of political economy, you certainly will not ſuffer yourſelves to be deceived by ſuch ſophiſtry.</p>
               <p>As all the private and public wealth of a country a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſes from the land, the revenue neceſſary for the ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of government can only be derived from the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietors and farmers; therefore, every indirect tax, however circuitous, muſt finally flow from the ſame ſource. You can gain no poſſible advantage from in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct taxes upon articles of conſumption, but on the contrary muſt ſuffer a very conſiderable loſs—The me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chanic —the manufacturer—the merchant, and every other claſs of citizens to whom you may have occaſion to pay wages, will make their charges in proportion to the duties they pay to the government: All ſuch ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences being deducted from the groſs produce of your
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:023507_0018_0FBFCC8215180258"/>farms, muſt diminiſh that ſurplus which conſtitutes your wealth, <hi>and in proportion to which you ſhould pay a revenue to the ſtate for protection.</hi> Such charges may become ſo great as to eat up the whole produce of your induſtry, particularly where the ſoil is not very rich and fertile. In this ſituation you may be regarded as ſlaves to ſupport the pageantry of government, but cannot be eſteemed freemen, acquiring property for yourſelves.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the ſecond poſition—that indirect taxes being optional, they are moſt conſiſtent with the independent ſpirit of freemen—it is a principle that no juſt or wiſe government will adopt. The tax which each individual is bound to pay, ought to be certain— the time and manner of payment, and the quantity to be paid, ought all to be clear and plain to the contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butor. Where it is otherwiſe, and it is left to the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of every perſon to contribute what ſum he pleaſes to the neceſſary expences of the ſtate, diſorder muſt pervade the moſt important department of government, and the public revenue will be in a ſituation of uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty never to be depended on. Beſides, a free citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zen of a republic will not wiſh to enjoy the protection of a government without contributing his juſt propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion towards its ſupport.</p>
               <p>An unjuſt and oppreſſive tax may be acquired from a free people without much difficulty, by laying a duty or exciſe upon articles of conſumption, in which caſe the purchaſer thinks he is only paying the price of the commodity, whilſt in fact he is paying a heavy tax. Such a ſyſtem of deception may be well calculated for an ariſtocracy, where a few haughty and deluded men are in the habit of violating the rights of their fello-citizens,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:023507_0019_0FBFCC8B9C988A98"/>and hold themſelves unaccountable for the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penditure of the public revenue—But is it ſafe for a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>public of freemen to be indifferent with reſpect to their finances? An enlightened people, wiſhing to preſerve the liberty of their country, will cheerfully ſubmit to their duty in contributing to the neceſſary expences of government, but at the ſame time will contend for their rights, in having the revenue ſtrictly appropriated to the juſt demands of the ſtate, and not waſted in ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting the parade or extravagance of the ſervants of the people, or in bribery and corruption.</p>
               <p>In whatever manner a tax is taken, it is not a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of indifference to the proſperity of the country. A tax ſhould take out of the pockets of the citizens as lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle as poſſible over and above what it brings into the public treaſury of the ſtate. Indirect taxes upon arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles of conſumption, in proportion to what they bring into the public treaſury, take from the people more than any other tax, by the number of revenue officers neceſſary to carry the ſyſtem into execution, whoſe ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laries and perquiſites are a real tax upon the people. However plauſible theſe taxes may appear, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceal a hidden poiſon, which is continually preying up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the induſtrious part of the community. De Witt obſerves, that the Dutch taxes upon conſumption, raiſed the price of their broad cloth 40 per cent. Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain has long labored under the ſame diſtemper, which, by excluding her from foreign markets, will put an end to her manufactures. Nothing ſupports them at pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent but the immenſe capitals inveſted in them, and the great perfection to which they have brought machinery to aid and facilitate the work. The agriculture and infant manufactures of your country muſt ſuffer a ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>milar fate, if the labor of the poor is to be enhanced by duties on ſalt and other neceſſary articles.</p>

               <head>LETTER IV.</head>
               <p>AS the earth is the only ſource of private and public wealth, it is evident that the revenue ſhould be determined by the immutable principles of juſtice, being ſtrictly confined to a certain proportion of the produce of the earth, after the deduction of every neceſſary ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the proprietor or farmer. The full cultiva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the ſoil, and the real intereſt of ſociety, depends upon this arrangement. It therefore cannot be vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated by government with impunity. The laborer, the mechanic, the manufacturer, and every other claſs of citizens, occupied in the ſervice of the Farmer, ought not to be ſubject to a capitation tax, or to any indirect tax upon the neceſſaries or conveniences of life. Theſe occupations, however uſeful or agreeable, yet not being productive of any real wealth, every charge and expence to which they are ſubject muſt be reimburſed by the Farmer. If theſe principles are not well founded, then civil ſociety can exiſt independent of the produce of the land, or cultivation, which is impoſſible.</p>
               <p>The hiſtory of all nations bears teſtimony that it is for want of looking to their true intereſt that ſo many governments purſue an unjuſt ſyſtem of ſinance, found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon indirect taxes; being influenced by the caprice of the moment, without any regard to futurity. Such governments not only direct every public meaſure, but alſo interfere in the moſt minute actions of their citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens: But as ſuch power is ſeldom exerciſed conſiſtent with the ſtrict principles of juſtice, it becomes oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, conſtantly violating the rights, the liberties and proſperity of the people. The ravages of ſuch govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be diſcovered in every quarter of the world: Its direful effects may be traced in the poverty, in the inactivity, and in the depopulated ſtate of all countries
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:023507_0021_0FBFCC8EDBCF79F0"/>which have experienced its fury. Why at the preſent day do we find people living in the moſt wretched miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry, although inhabiting countries which by induſtry would afford them every convenience to render them happy and comfortable? Why are they deprived of uſeful manufactures, or neceſſary arts? Is the climate or ſoil of Egypt, of Greece, of Italy, and many other countries, now languiſhing in a ſtate of miſery, chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed? or, muſt we not rather attribute this aſtoniſhing alteration to the deſpotiſm of their governments, which has fruſtrated the moſt bountiful gifts of nature. Such tyrants, influenced by a puerile pride, attached to their own perſons, and having no idea of real grandeur, connected with the general proſperity of the people, are contented to govern countries almoſt depopulated, and which preſent to the traveller the remains of a former proſperity and population, contraſted with the diſtreſſing appearance of preſent miſery and wretched<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs. The negligence and the extravagance of unjuſt governments have in this manner changed the moſt flouriſhing and populous countries into deſerts. The land, abandoned by the cultivator, frequently occaſions famines, followed by contagion. All countries be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come healthy in proportion to their cultivation; they are not cultivated but in proportion to their popula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; they are not populous but in proportion to the proſperity, the eaſe and liberty of their inhabitants.</p>
               <p>No government ever derived advantage from keeping its citizens in a ſtate of miſery; and yet there are ſome politicians who dare to ſupport the falſe and deteſtible opinion, that to render the people ſubſervient to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment it is neceſſary to keep them poor and depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent. Men treated in this way will either fall into a ruinous lethargy and inaction; or, becoming deſperate
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:023507_0022_0FBFCC908708D7A0"/>by accumulated wrongs, they will puniſh the authors of their miſery. A government that wiſhes to acquire the love and confidence of its citizens, ſhould be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly engaged in promoting their proſperity and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs —This maxim, ſo ſimple, and ſo ſelf-evident, yet is too little attended to, by men exerciſing the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign power of ſtates—On the contrary, unjuſt and arbitrary rulers expect to be honored, whilſt their op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive conduct only inſpires horror. They deſire that the agriculture of their country ſhould flouriſh, whilſt by unjuſt commercial regulations they prevent the free ſale of the produce of labor—They wiſh that a general ſpirit of induſtry ſhould prevail, whilſt by indirect taxes they clog and impede every exertion of their citizens. They wiſh to enjoy an extenſive com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, whilſt by the moſt impolitic mercantile regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions they diſcourage foreigners from viſiting their ports.</p>
               <p>All theſe evils ariſe from inattention, or from an ignorance of the real intereſt of civil ſociety, as found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the full cultivation of the ſoil.</p>
               <p>As you, my fellow-citizens, value the real proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of your country, acquaint yourſelves with the cauſes of the decline and fall of nations. The ſame effects will ever follow the ſame cauſes; and therefore you ſhould ſtrictly attend to the operations of that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſive and dangerous government which you have juſt adopted. Congreſs is eſtabliſhing a ſyſtem of finance, founded in deception, which never has been purſued by any government but to the oppreſſion of the great body of the people. Do not ſuffer yourſelves to be lulled into a dangerous lethargy by the opinions of thoſe men who are looking to Congreſs for lucrative
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:023507_0023_0FBFCC94ED1588D0"/>offices, that they may be unjuſtly ſupported by the labor of others.—Come forward—tell your ſervants in Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, that it is you who muſt feel the effects of their Machiavelian politics; tell them the truth, and convince them that their own true intereſts depend upon the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral proſperity of the people. Convinced that a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic revenue is neceſſary for the ſupport of government, tell them that you are willing to pay a juſt proportion of the annual produce of your land into the public treaſury, but that the remainder ſhall be left free at your own diſpoſal.</p>
               <p>A ſyſtem of ſinance of this kind is not unprecedent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed<note n="*" place="bottom">In China the revenue of the Sovereign is derived from the land which riſes or falls with the plenty or ſcarcity of the annual produce. The public revenue in that extenſive empire being immediately connected with the cul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivation of the land; therefore Agriculture becomes an object of public at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention.</note> —The Prince of Baden, in Germany, with full conſent of his ſubjects, has long ſince adopted it; in conſequence of which he has aboliſhed every ſpecies of indirect tax, and all trafficking or commercial regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, leaving the actions of his ſubjects totally free, except where they violate the rights of others. It is ſaid the Duke of Tuſcany, and ſome other Princes in Europe, are about adopting ſimilar principles of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue.</p>
               <p>But the apparent advantages of commercial regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and of indirect taxes upon articles of conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, ſeduces your government in ſuch a manner, that although at preſent it makes this ſyſtem of finance, an excuſe to prevent the exceſſive uſe of foreign articles of luxury, there is great reaſon to apprehend that it will, in time, become the only ſource from whence a public revenue will be drawn—The facility of adding
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:023507_0024_0FBFCC9CEB7BD600"/>to the old taxes, or inventing new ones—the eaſe of collecting—the pecuniary advantages which a great number of citizens gain as agents, and the deception which takes place upon acquiring a revenue by an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>direct tax upon articles of conſumption, will all tend to eſtabliſh this deſtructive ſyſtem. The principle of fiſcality will pervade every department of government, and the intereſt of the Farmer, the mechanic, the la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>borer, and the moſt neceſſary and uſeful citizens, will conſtantly be ſacrificed to rich monied men, who will be always ready to become the creditors of the ſtate, in order to enjoy, in a ſlothful indolence, a participation of the public revenue.</p>
               <p>This ſyſtem of taxation is more ruinous by its de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructive effects upon cultivation, than by the enormous expence neceſſary to carry it into operation: and yet, if you refuſe to pay to government a juſt proportion of the net produce of your farms, by a direct tax, and you will ſubmit to be deceived and ruined by the arts and projects of crafty financiers, you muſt expect that, by circuitous impoſitions, the free ſale of your produce will be circumſcribed, and the very ſources of your riches will be deſtroyed. The immutable principles of political economy cannot be diverted or fruſtrated by the falſe opinions of ſpeculative men. A conſtant re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue is necſſeary for the ſupport of civil government; the ſource of ſuch revenue ſhould be equally certain, and therefore muſt ariſe from the annual produce of the land.</p>
               <p>The difference to the Farmer between a direct and an indirect tax, is very great. A direct tax is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſined to a juſt proportion of the not produce of the land.—Indirect taxes are obſcure in their operation,
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:023507_0025_0FBFCC9DDD42EFB0"/>devoid of all order and proportion. The money raiſed by a direct tax paſſes immediately into the public Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſury, whilſt an indirect tax, upon articles of conſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, requires a great expence to ſupport a hoſt of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue officers. A direct tax, being confined to a juſt proportion of the net produce of your farms, can never be oppreſſive; whilſt an indirect tax, preying upon the groſs produce of your farms, will deſtroy the means of future cultivation.</p>
               <p>When the public revenue depends upon indirect taxes, little attention is given to economy in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penditure of it. Miniſters look forward to future taxes to ſupply deficiencies, but ſuch reſources do not produce relief to ſatisfy the demand, becauſe the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue muſt be diminiſhed in proportion to the deſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the productive fund. In this ſtate of diſorder the expence will always exceed the public revenue: every year will create new demands, and will augment the difficulty of providing for them. Under theſe cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances public debts muſt be contracted, by which you will unjuſtly burthen poſterity to diſcharge debts contracted to ſupport the folly and extravagance of the preſent day.</p>
               <p>The dreadful example of Great Britain, and of ſome other nations, which have given way to the deſtructive ſyſtem of ſupporting their governments, by procuring public credit, ſhould be a warning to this infant repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic: Should we be ſo far infatuated as to adopt ſimilar principles of ſinance, we muſt expect that the property of our beſt and moſt uſeful citizens, will be ſacrificed to ſatiate the unbounded avarice of ſtock-jobbers and uſurers; and the wealth of our country, wreſted from neceſſary agricultural improvements, (in which the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:023507_0026_0FBFCC9F54726000"/>of the whole community is concerned) will be devoted to ſupport the parade and diſſipation of a few idle men, in great cities.</p>
               <p>The eſſential object of civil ſociety is, to procure to every individual citizen the greateſt poſſible happineſs, by ſecuring to him the full enjoyment of his property. Under this general term is included, the property of perſon, the property of moveable goods, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty of the ſoil rendered productive by labor.</p>
               <p>In the natural order of political economy, the duties and rights of men are equal. The right which cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſponds with the abſolute duty and neceſſity of ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying our wants, is the right of a full and entire liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of our perſons. To violate this right, is to deſtroy the very intention of our exiſtence. Every man in your country, ſhould be regarded as the abſolute ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign of his perſon. The nature of our exiſtence, by which we are rendered liable to conſtant wants, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minds us of our duty, without the interference of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment to preſcribe or delimit our conduct. A wiſe legiſlature will not, therefore, interfere with the actions of citizens, <hi>except when they violate the rights of others.</hi> Make uſe of every means in your power to eſtabliſh this firſt law of nature. The two other ſpecies of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty depends upon the unequivocal rights of our per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons. The three together will inſure the proſperity and ſtability of your government.</p>
               <p>Our rights over the other ſpecies of property ariſe from the labor we have beſtowed in acquiring them, or from the bounty of others: Such property can be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lienated, as its exiſtence does not depend upon the life of the original proprietor.</p>
               <p>

The neceſſity of ſubſiſtence excites us to work.— The firſt employ is that of hunting, or collecting the ſpontaneous fruits of the earth: By this means, men are ſupported during the time they are engaged in clearing the land, and rendering it productive by agriculture. The property of goods precedes the property of land, in the ſame manner that perſonal property precedes both. They are all ſo intimately blended together, that one cannot be violated without the others ſuffering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury. Of what advantage is the free diſpoſal of a man's perſon, if the whole property acquired by his labor, is to be wreſted from him by an arbitrary power? The territorial right of a government, can give it no legal authority over the property of its citizens; except as far as is neceſſary to ſupport the expence of protection conſiſtent with the original compact.</p>
               <p>If you admit theſe principles to form the baſis of your laws, you may expect, that the agriculture of your country will immediately revive. Under your govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, men will regard their property as certain of the powerful protection of inviolable juſtice, and, therefore, will inveſt large ſums of money in the cultivation of the earth, as the moſt proſitable employ. You beſt know how far an event of this importance is to be deſired: Your experience has long ſince taught you, that land is productive in proportion to the previous expence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed.</p>
               <p>Men do not eſteem or value property but as they are the peaceable poſſeſſors of it; and, therefore in a coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try where the moveable property is not exempt from tax, and held ſacred, the idea of wealth will only be attached to gold and ſilver, the amount of which, in the hands of individuals, is ſeldom known to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic.
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:023507_0028_0FBFCCAA5C391CE8"/>From hence accumulation of gold will be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the only riches of your country, and every art will be made uſe of to draw it from ſtrangers, not to be appropriated to the neceſſary and uſeful improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of agriculture and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 span">

               <p>The induſtry of a country will ever be influenced by its laws. Oppreſſed by unjuſt laws, men will not inveſt their money in the cultivation of the land, which, to render productive, requires great expence of money, or moveable property.</p>
               <p>The real wealth of a country, as ariſing from agri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culture, ſhould pay a tax to that government by which it is protected. Whatever form it may afterwards aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, or however it may change its ſituation, it ſhould be left to the free diſpoſal of the proprietor. This is the right of every citizen, and it is the duty of the ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign authority to ſupport him in ſuch right.</p>
               <p>The poſſeſſion of territory, without its being culti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated, is of little value to civil ſociety, whether con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſting of foreſts or extenſive plains, depopulated by oppreſſive governments. Perſonal labor and move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able property are neceſſary to render the land pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive.</p>
               <p>From the principles adduced reſpecting the public revenue due to a government, it appears,</p>
               <p n="1">1ſt. That civil ſociety has no claim upon the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of a citizen, becauſe he derives this right from GOD, independent of ſociety.</p>
               <p n="2">
                  <pb n="30" facs="unknown:023507_0029_0FBFCCAC16B589A0"/>
2d. That moveable property owes nothing to go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, as its juſt appropriation is to render the land productive; on which account it ſhould be left to the free diſpoſal of the proprietor.</p>
               <p>The full liberty and ſecurity of theſe rights, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by the concurrence and union of men in civil ſociety, produces an increaſe of property, which is obtained from the earth by means of agriculture. The net produce of ſuch property, together with a very ſmall part naturally ariſing from fertile ſoils, conſtitute the real wealth of a people, and therefore is the only ſo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="3 letters">
                     <desc>•••</desc>
                  </gap>e from which a juſt revenue can be drawn. As this advantage to individuals totally depends on the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of government, it becomes the firſt duty of every citizen to ſupport its authority and power. This pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference is conſiſtent with ſtrict juſtice, becauſe men ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire the whole of ſuch property under the protection of civil ſociety. Theſe reciprocal rights and duties of the people and of the ſovereign power, being well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood, and mutually ſupported, muſt render a go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment happy and permanent. Under its benign influence, the net produce of the land would become the greateſt poſſible to the emolument of the Farmer, and through him to the advantage of every individual in the ſtate.</p>
               <p>Under whatever form the ſovereign authority of a country may be adminiſtered, it has a juſt claim only to a certain proportion of the net produce of the earth, to defray the neceſſary expence of protection, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it ſhould be regarded as a co-partner with the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietor or Farmer. In this ſituation it could never in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the rights of its citizens, without experiencing an equal injury to its own power. As the proſperity and
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:023507_0030_0FBFCCAD9EBAF180"/>happineſs of the people, and the full enjoyment of their rights, is of conſequence to the ſovereign authority, ſo the proſperity and power of the government is equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly intereſting to the people under its protection. The only means of eſtabliſhing a uſeful and permanent a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement between theſe reciprocal rights and duties, ſo neceſſary to be ſupported, is to eſtabliſh the juſt pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion due to government for protection, and ſtrictly conſining the appropriation of the public revenue to the neceſſary ſervices of the ſtate, and not ſacrificing it to the ſupport of a few men in lucrative or unneceſſary offices. The power and authority of government, u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nited with the private exertions of our citizens to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the land productive, would make our country po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>polous and happy.</p>
               <p>Such is the immutable law of political economy, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained by GOD to promote the happineſs of men united in ſociety, and is the only juſt foundation of revenue.</p>

               <p>HOW long will you ſuffer yourſelves to be duped by the low cunning and artifice of half-informed Law<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yers, and mercenary Merchants? Are theſe characters to be the dictators of a free people? Are you to have no laws, no regulations, but through their influence, or by their authority?—Certainly you have not wreſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the power from Great Britain, to place it in the hands of theſe men. As you value your own proſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity and that of your children, look well to the preſent moment: a dangerous ariſtocracy is forming, which if not cruſhed in the bud, will deſtroy your liberties for ever: Continuing in a ſtate of lethargy reſpecting pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic affairs, you will too late repent of your folly and negligence.</p>
               <p>From whence does your government derive its au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority for interfering in, or directing the occupation of its citizens—from whence its power of reſtricting the free ſale of the produce of your farms by commercial regulations? Are theſe meaſures founded in wiſdom and juſtice; or are they not rather a contemptible imi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation of the oppreſſive governments in Europe, where it is a political maxim, that it is neceſſary to keep the <hi>people</hi> poor and dependent, in order to render them ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſive. This could not be effected by an equal direct tax, and therefore recourſe is had to indirect taxes up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on articles of conſumption; by which means the weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy citizens and great landed proprietors, do not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute to the public revenue in proportion to their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, whilſt the Farmer, the mechanic, and the labor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, are unjuſtly oppreſſed. The proſperity of your country does not require that a few members of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety ſhould enjoy a ſuperſluity of wealth, but that the great body of the people ſhould live at their eaſe and be
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:023507_0032_0FBFCCBA10087A18"/>happy. It is the misfortune of the preſent day to connect the dignity of government, with the parade and extravagance of its officers. A more ruinous ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem of policy cannot be purſued, than laviſhing the property of induſtrious citizens upon uſeleſs offices, or in <hi>penſions</hi> to idle men in no manner engaged in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting the good of the Commonwealth. The wealth of private citizens at their own free command, and employed by themſelves, will ever be of the greateſt advantage to their country. It is therefore the inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt of every nation that ſuch uſeful characters ſhould enjoy the moſt comfortable ſupport, that thereby they may be encouraged to defend and ſupport their coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try in times of public danger. To make war a profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, in order to acquire territory or riches, is to ruin the great body of citizens, to enable a few to enrich themſelves—beſides, money thus acquired conſtantly brings in its train luxury, venality, baſeneſs, and every vice which tends to the deſtruction of civil ſociety.</p>
               <p>Almoſt all the wars which have been entered into by the kingdoms of Europe for many years paſt, have been to procure to themſelves an extenſive commerce, which has appeared to them the only ſource of wealth. Their politicians do not perceive that the abundance of ſilver, produced by commerce, terminates by deſtroying commerce itſelf. The greater the quantity of money, bank notes, or any circulating paper, in a country, the greater will become the price of ſuſtenance, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently of work; then the poorer nations will natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally ſupplant their rich neighbours in their commerce. Merchants will always apply where they can be ſupplied at the loweſt rate.</p>

Your Legiſlators appear to forget that their country is inhabited by an independent yeomanry, who ought to be regarded as the moſt valuable claſs of citizens, and not ſacrificed to the avidity of merchants, who are citizens of the world, and who know no country but their coffers of gold. The Farmer, finally, pays all the impoſts, and by his induſtry procures from the earth the neceſſary ſubſiſtence for ſociety. Merchants are in general engaged in furniſhing nations with uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs or unneceſſary articles.—Their commerce would be confined within narrow limits, if they were only to ſupply thoſe things neceſſary to render life comfortable or happy. It is true, that in a country accuſtomed to frivolity and diſſipation, a vitiated taſte makes many things indiſpenſable; but are governments inſtituted to ſupport the extravagant fancies of a few idle men, who know nothing more intereſting to their country, than what will contribute to their own vanity, or grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication?</p>
               <p>An enlightened government will ever give the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt attention to the happineſs and to the proſperity of its real citizens; to thoſe who poſſeſs and cultivate the land: it will give every encouragement to agriculture, as the moſt uſeful occupation in which its citizens can be employed.</p>
               <p>What advantage has the yeomanry of any country derived from wars undertaken on account of commerce? Nothing but new taxes, or having their eſtates and the induſtry of their children mortgaged, to pay an annu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al and heavy intereſt to a few monied men.</p>
               <p>To appeaſe the clamors of merchants, who think themſelves of importance to the ſtate, becauſe they oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:023507_0034_0FBFCCBC94176AD8"/>an influx of ſilver, wars are commenced and purſued to the ruin of the Farmer. The ordinary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues of the ſtate are found inſufficient to ſatisfy the additional expence occaſioned by the war, and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment has recourſe to public credit. The wealthy Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chant lends the money to government, and the Farmer pays the intereſt without receiving any benefit from the meaſure. In this manner a commercial war, carried on at the expence of the lives of many valuable citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens, and much treaſure, terminates in bringing an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional burthen on the nation. Whilſt it enriches merchants, financiers and uſurers, who may poſſeſs no real property in the ſtate, and who may remove from it, as ſoon as they have accumulated the property of its laborious citizens.</p>
               <p>The eſtabliſhment of public funds, from whence your wealthy citizens may draw an annual income, will not only become very burthenſome to the induſtrious part of the community, but will alſo favor the indolence of men, who, neglecting agriculture, or any other em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of real uſe to their country, will abandon themſelves to indolence, and ſeek for amuſement in the diſſipation of your cities, which they will infeſt by their diſorderly lives. Wiſhing to preſerve the man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of the people, you ſhould not ſuffer your govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to furniſh any citizens with the means of living in a uſeleſs ſtate of inaction, but rather provide for the happineſs of the great body of the people, by encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them in moderate work, by which they may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the real comforts of life. It is impoſſible to ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der men happy whilſt plunged in eſſiminacy, indolence and vice, and whoſe diſordered imaginations are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petually occupied in creating chimerical wants.</p>

The unjuſt policy of nations in violating the rights of the people in favor of a few, is the fruitful ſource of every moral and political evil.</p>
               <p>Public credit, which our politicians eſteem of the greateſt importance to government, ſhould be regard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as the moſt unjuſt and ruinous invention of modern times. It is only uſeful and convenient to ſerve the ambitious projects of governments, and to add to the wealth of monied men. The facility of acquiring cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dit precipitates nations into wars and other expences beyond the revenues of the ſtate; funding ſyſtems are adopted, and peace itſelf does not relieve the people from oppreſſive taxes; but the miſery of the preſent generation is unjuſtly tranſmitted to poſterity. Thus kingdoms, which paſs for the moſt opulent, experience real diſtreſs, and thoſe who govern them are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally reduced to ſeek for new expedients to ſatisfy the demands of uſurers. They reſemble thoſe young men who borrow money at any rate, and mortgage their patrimony to ſupply the extravagancies and follies of youth.</p>
               <p>In Turkey, and ſuch deſpotic governments, where the lives and fortunes of the people are at the arbitrary diſpoſal of the ſupreme power of the ſtate, the proper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the ſubject is taken by force—and therefore there is no occaſion to ſupport the phantom of public credit. Free governments, unjuſtly or weakly adminiſtered, have recourſe to this deſtructive expedient. By dou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceurs and great apparent advantages, men are tempted to become creditors to the ſtate—Government finds it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf embarraſſed, and every artifice and deception is made uſe of to draw money from the people to ſatisfy the demands of men, who living upon the blood of
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:023507_0036_0FBFCCC7D813ECD8"/>their fellow-citizens, inſult them with an oſtentatious parade of their ill-gotten wealth.</p>
               <p>An extenſive public credit can be of little ſervice to you: it may tend to ruin your country. The cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of borrowing will precipitate your Legiſlators in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to unneceſſary expences and wars, which may be a means of adding to the wealth of a few artful men, but will add nothing to the happineſs of the uſeful and laborious citizen.</p>
               <p>The enormous debts, which at preſent oppreſs and will ruin all the great nations of Europe, has been pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſive; and the practice of funding ſuch debts has gradually enfeebled every ſtate which has adopted that deſtructive ſyſtem. The republics of Venice and Genoa, have long languiſhed under the oppreſſive load, and the citizens of Holland can no longer boaſt of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joying their ancient liberty, whilſt they are under the abſolute control of an ariſtocracy of monied men.</p>
               <p>To proportion your expences to your income, is a maxim as neceſſary to be attended to by government, as by individuals. This ſalutary principle is deſpiſed and neglected when public credit is too eaſily acquired; and, therefore, in the place of eſteeming an enormous public debt as a bleſſing, every wiſe and good man will regard it with anxiety and horror.</p>
               <p>Let your government conduct with that degree of wiſdom and juſtice, as to ſecure the conſidence and affection of the <hi>people,</hi> and it will have no occaſion of rich creditors, to ſupport its authority and dignity.</p>

Whilſt engaged in the laborious, but honorable, em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy of cultivating your ſields, it would afford you ſome conſolation to reflect, that, after paying into the public treaſury an equitable proportion of the net pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of your farms, to defray the expences of a juſt government; you were permitted to enjoy the free diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſal of the remainder. But to ſee your property waſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſupport the diſſipation, extravagance and folly of officers of government, or unjuſtly taken from you to ſupport idle peaſioners and placemen, is hard indeed. But even here the evil does not end; the pittance of property left, is made ſubject to commercial regula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and thus your rights are ſacrificed to add to the wealth of a few merchants in your ſea ports. How far ſuch regulations are politic or juſt, requires your ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous conſideration.

               <p>Your Legiſlators, not daring openly to violate your rights, effect their purpoſe under the pretext of neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary commercial regulations; this point being once firmly eſtabliſhed, they will follow the example of Great Britain, and interſere in every action of your lives, till, at length, like the people of that devoted country, you will not deſerve the name of freemen.

               <p>The diſpoſal of the produce of your labor is not an adventitious right, ariſing from your connection in civil ſociety, but is one of thoſe natural, original rights, to preſerve which, you have entered into ſociety.</p>
               <p>To acquire an unreſtricted commerce, was one of the objects for which you contended with Britain, and now you ſubmit to its being violated by your immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate repreſentatives.</p>
               <p>All reſtrictions of trade, under the name of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mercial regulations, are impolitic, oppreſſive, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>juſt; and whatever form they may aſſume, they have ever been found burthenſome to the people and injuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous to the revenues of the ſtate. No authority on earth has alegal right to ſubject you to ſuch regulations. The firſt right derived from nature, is the full liberty of our faculties, and the enjoyment of property ariſing from the uſe of them. Our ſenſations engage us to purſue ſuch advantages, to ſeek pleaſure, to avoid pain, to ſupport our exiſtence, and to ſatisfy our wants by
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:023507_0039_0FBFCCD46EBA47C0"/>the means of a multitude of productions, which we cannot make uſe of without acquiring them, and which we cannot acquire but by the full enjoyment of our fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culties and of our labor.</p>
               <p>All aſſociations among men have commenced from an expreſs or tacit convention to reſpect each others rights. When ſuch primitive aſſociations created a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign authority, it was becauſe the great increaſe of population, and the neceſſary inequality of riches, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered the rights of all unſafe; and therefore to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote order, and the better to ſecure to every one the uſe of his property, government was armed with a power ſuperior to that of any individual. No other intereſt, no other motive, no other object could have engaged men to ſubmit to ſuch authority.</p>
               <p>The original and fundamental title, which the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs of the United States has to ſovereignty, is to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain, to protect, and to preſerve the rights of all.— Theſe rights, as has been obſerved, conſiſt in every ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen enjoying the greateſt poſſible advantage from the uſe of his faculties and property, which includes an unlimited purſuit in every kind of work, and a free ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change of his property. Theſe principles cannot be contradicted, but in an age of ignorance and barbari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, in which the rights of the ſovereign and of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are not known. Nor can your government violate them without diminiſhing the riches, the proſperity and number of our citizens, and conſequently the wealth and power of our country.</p>
               <p>It is eaſy to purſue the beaten track of <hi>Britiſh</hi> poli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tics; but it requires an enlightened underſtanding, and ſome attention to diſcern, the <hi>natural</hi> and <hi>inevitable</hi>
                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:023507_0040_0FBFCCD623BF2B38"/>conſequence of adopting ſuch meaſures. Local and temporary evils diſappear before the eye of a wiſe Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſlator, who takes a general view of things, and regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lates his conduct in conformity to the natural and eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial laws of <hi>juſtice.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is a law anterior to civil laws, the ſupport of which ought to be the only object of government. It is the ſacred law of PROPERTY: By this, every man has a right to the free diſpoſal of his perſon, and of goods acquired by his induſtry as far as he does not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jure the rights of others. This principle ſo ſimple in itſelf conſtitutes the foundation and baſis of civil law.</p>
               <p>The firſt property of man is that of his perſon, which conſiſts in the free uſe of his faculties. A ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond property, not leſs ſacred, ariſes from the firſt, and conſiſts in the goods acquired by his induſtry.— The fruits of the tree which he cultivates, and the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of grain which he ſows, although he receives them at the hands of nature, yet this bounty is not purely gratuitous, but is the juſt reward of his atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and labor. It is then evident that man's right to ſuch property is abſolute, that he may uſe it, or deſtroy it at his pleaſure, without being accountable to any ſet of men on earth. It is impoſſible to conceive that, conſiſtent with the ſtrict principles of juſtice, ſuch right can be ſuſceptible of any limitation. Should you deſire to cut down a tree which you had planted, ſhould you wiſh to conſume, or even to deſtroy, the produce of your farms, what right has government to interſere, to prevent you from having the free diſpoſal of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty ariſing from your exertions, and conſtituting the reward of your induſtry?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:023507_0041_0FBFCCD7F0C45448"/>
Unpon this right, which every man has over his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty, is founded his right to a free, unlimited com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce, or exchange of ſuch property. This liberty is neceſſary to accompliſh the mutual exchange of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty amongſt men, to ſatisfy their reciprocal wants. This exchange is a contract purely natural, where the command of property ſhould be free in its moſt exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive ſenſe. Civil law may intervene to compel the exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of a contract; but it ought not to regulate the conditions or limit the price.</p>
               <p>The neceſſary effect of the diviſion, the diſtribution and the free circulation of property, is to produce the juſt value of every commodity. A fair competition takes place between the purchaſers, and the price of the merchandiſe is regulated by its plenty or ſcarcity. No perſon will have juſt reaſon to complain where the price of things are in this manner regulated by cauſes purely natural.</p>
               <p>A perfect free trade will always enſure to the Farmer the higheſt price for his produce, by bringing purchaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of every denomination to his very doors: and by creating a competition between the purchaſers, that price will always afford the moſt juſt criterion of the real value of property. Under the laws of order and juſtice, every man enjoys the greateſt poſſible liberty in the exercife of his right of property; and therefore he is encouraged to render his farm in the higheſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree productive, not only to his own emolument, but to that of his country: Such might be your happy ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, if the natural order of things was not inverted by arbitrary commercial regulations.</p>
               <p>Wherever the right of property is violated by pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hibitive laws, or a juſt competition deſtroyed by exclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:023507_0042_0FBFCCDA6F45F1A8"/>regulation, all muſt be confuſion and diſorder.— The price of things not being influenced by natural cauſes, every man ſeeks to give them a complexion fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vorable to himſelf; and commerce, inſtead of being an amicable exchange of property, becomes the theatre of little, low cunning and deception. The Farmers and Merchants, no longer obliged to ſubmit to the common law of competition, treat each other as ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and reciprocally ſeek to turn in their own favor a balance which is always falſe, when not regulated by LIBERTY. The merchant, enjoying a monopoly un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the ſanction of law, obtains the property of the Farmer without giving the full value of it, and by this means unjuſtly deprives him of the reward of his labor.</p>
               <p>It is greatly to be lamented that the commercial re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gulations and laws of all the nations in Europe, are founded in error and injuſtice; and it is equally to be lamented that your ſervants in Congreſs are adopting ſimilar meaſures. It is time that a free people ſhould know, that however high the authority from which they take their examples, yet that error never will ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion injuſtice and oppreſſion.</p>
               <p>It is confidently aſſerted that <hi>Great Britain</hi> owes all her power and grandeur to her <hi>navigation act.</hi>—to her <hi>exciſe laws</hi>—and to her commercial regulations—To thoſe cauſes ſhe is indebted for the miſery of her moſt uſeful citizens. The grandeur and power of a nation muſt be eſtimated, not from the exuberant wealth of the few, but from the eaſe and proſperity of the many. It is true that <hi>London,</hi> and ſome other parts of Britain, exhibit an appearance of wealth, little known in former days. But what is the ſituation of the great body of the <hi>people?</hi> Marchall and Young, two of the lateſt and
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:023507_0043_0FBFCCDCD33D52D0"/>moſt accurate obſervers of the agriculture of England, declare that the yeomanry of that country are almoſt annihilated; and their manufacturers and laborers are daily becoming objects of charity. Inſtead of being alarmed at theſe appearances, and ſeeking to remedy ſo great an evil we are told with the moſt aſtoniſhing, thoughtleſs exultation, that their King was chanted in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to church by ſeven thouſand <hi>charity children,</hi> and that three hundred thouſand children belonging to <hi>parents</hi> not <hi>capable of bearing, the expence of their education,</hi> were objects of <hi>Sunday ſchools.</hi> Whilſt ſuch inſtances mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt the humanity and benevolence of that nation, they at the ſame time afford the moſt unequivocal proof of the wretched, depending ſituation of the <hi>people.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The navigation act of Britain, which appears to be the fond object of imitation with Congreſs, has for more than a century, ſubjected the induſtrious part of the people to a legal monopoly; it has violated the rights of the huſbandman, and of the moſt induſtrious citizens, to augment the riches of the merchants: it has impoveriſhed the maſters of the houſe, the real citizens occupying the land, to enrich the ſervants; it has contributed to raiſe pecuniary fortunes, by which the delirium of public ſunds has been ſupported. The merchants of London, Briſtol and other ſea ports, have rapidly increaſed their fortunes at the expence of their fellow-citizens, and becoming of importance by the influence of their riches, they have precipitated the nation into commercial wars beyond its ability.</p>
               <p>Had Britain never experienced the <hi>curſe</hi> of a <hi>naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion act</hi>—had the induſtrious part of the nation been permitted to enjoy the full and juſt value of the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce of their labor, by a free commerce; had ſhe not
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:023507_0044_0FBFCCE26527EEB0"/>entered into wars to ſupport the unbounded avarice of her merchants—had ſhe not borrowed money, and <hi>funded her debts,</hi> to enable her to carry on ſuch wars —and had ſhe avoided <hi>exciſe laws,</hi> and every ſpecies of indirect taxation; contenting herſelf with a juſt portion of the net produce of the land, the great body of the people would enjoy a degree of eaſe and happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to which they are now ſtrangers, and the nation itſelf would experience real proſperity and power.</p>
               <p>The raw, bulky materials, which conſtitute the principal part of your exports, does not afford a freight to ſatisfy your merchants; and therefore, theſe men, ever attentive to their private emolument, have taken the advantage of your lethargy, and have influenced Congreſs to enact the moſt arbitrary and unjuſt laws, ſacrificing your rights and your property, to add to their wealth.</p>
               <p>Engage your Legiſlators to take a ſurvey of the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hauſted, and almoſt diſmantled ſtate of your farms; inform them of your poverty and inability to render your farms productive, and then let them turn their attention to the eaſe and affluence of the merchants, enjoying every comfort and luxury in your great cities. The contraſt is ſo great that no man can think it con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with juſtice, that Congreſs ſhould eſtabliſh a monopoly in their favor. A juſt competition for the produce of your farms, being deſtroyed by reſtricting foreign veſſels from coming amongſt us; the whole agricultural intereſt of your country muſt depend upon the mercy of a combination of merchants.</p>

               <head>LETTER VI.</head>
               <p>KNOWING what conſtitutes your rights, you ſhould comply with that duty you owe to yourſelves and to your poſterity, and ſupport ſuch rights.</p>
               <p>Do not ſuffer ambitious and deſigning men to miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lead you into an opinion, that whilſt you enjoy the freedom of electing your Legiſlators there is no danger of your rights being violated. This is a dangerous and falſe doctrine; for laws made by the immediate repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives of the people, are not always juſt. Britain, which is regarded by many of our politicians, as an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample worthy of imitation, is continually enacting laws, not only unjuſt, but oppreſſive to her moſt valuable citizens. You can only be regarded as a free people whilſt your Legiſlature adheres ſtrictly to the laws of nature, and calculates every one of its regulations for the protection of PROPERTY, and for promoting the <hi>general happineſs</hi> of the community. This princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple is too frequently ſtifled by the voice of avarice and ambition; the wealthy citizens, by intrigue, ſumptuous entertainments, and bribery, influence the conduct of Legiſlators; and when by ſuch means a law is obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in favor of the few, however the general rights of the community may be violated, yet it muſt never be altered or repealed, from a mock apprehenſion of a breach of public faith.</p>
               <p>Under ſuch circumſtances of fineſſe and impoſition, it is neceſſary that you ſhould ſupport a regular militia; otherwiſe an army of mercenaries may be thought ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to procure obedience to laws. This has taken place in England to ſupport the moſt unjuſt and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſive exciſe laws; and the Miniſtry of that country
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:023507_0046_0FBFCCE82BAF26B8"/>depends more on a willing, obedient ſoldiery, than on the juſtice of laws, to procure a ſubmiſſion to them.</p>
               <p>Under every government the dernier reſort of the people, is an appeal to the ſword; whether to defend themſelves againſt the open attacks of a foreign enemy, or to check the inſidious encroachments of domeſtic foes. Whenever a people are ſo enervated by luxury, as to intruſt the defence of their country to a regular, ſtanding army, compoſed of mercenaries, the power of that country will remain under the direction and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence of the moſt wealthy citizens. The hiſtory of Holland and other modern republics will manifeſt, how far a <hi>mere monied intereſt</hi> is to be intruſted with the li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties of the people. This ſubject requires your moſt ſerious conſideration. Whatever form your govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may aſſume, your liberties will be ſafe as long as you ſupport a well regulated militia. Thoſe who expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience the labor of acquiring property, will ever be the beſt defenders of it.</p>
