            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <p>WHEN the laſt Cenſor went to the preſs, the long conteſted and important queſtion on the treaty with Great Britain was ſtill undecided. Go! ſaid I, gentle Cenſor, and, in thy mild and conciliating accents, beſeech the deſperate demagogues to ſpare us a little longer.</p>
               <p>A ſort of cloud had interpoſed between the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and the ſun of proſperity. Terror had ſeized on all thoſe who had ſomething to loſe; they knew not whether it was prudent to buy or to ſell, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther their ſhips were ſafeſt in the harbour or out at ſea; the ſans-culottes began to grind their teeth and whet their couteaux, while the heads of the ariſtocrats ſeemed to totter on their ſhoulders, and hang as it were by a bit of ſkin.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="173" facs="unknown:030223_0004_0FE52B371A483DB0"/>In this ſituation were we, when, on the 29th of April, the queſtion was taken in a committee of the whole Houſe. The <hi>Ayes</hi> were 49 and the <hi>Noes</hi> 49: the Chairman, Mr. Muhlenberg of Penn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſylvania gave the caſting vote in the affirmative.</p>
               <p>Thus was the fate of a nation ſuſpended upon the voice of one man, and thus have we once more narrowly eſcaped war and anarchy.</p>
               <p>Some benignant ſylph certainly whiſpered Mr. Muhlenberg in the ear; for, it is well known, that he had been a declared enemy to the treaty from the firſt moment of its appearance. He was one of the leaders at the town meeting held at Philadel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phia on the 25th of July, 1795. At this meeting "the d—ned treaty was kicked to hell," and the aſſembly adjourned to go and break Mr. Bingham's windows. This meeting appointed a committee to draw up a memorial, praying the Preſident not to ratify the Treaty. The memorial after reprobating every article of the treaty ſingly, concludes thus: <q>Your committee apprehend that great evils would reſult to theſe States from this treaty, if ratified, they therefore recommend that an addreſs be prepared, and preſented to the Preſident of the United States, praying that he will not ratify the ſaid treaty.</q> Now, Mr. Muhlenberg was one of the very committee who drew up this memorial. Nor did his oppoſition ceaſe here; for we find him voting for the papers, and for the proteſting reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of Mr. Blount. Had he not voted for this latter reſolution, I could have admitted, that he gave his caſting vote from a perſuaſion that the Houſe had no right to ſet the treaty aſide; but, in voting for the reſolution of Mr. Blount, he in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts on this right, and therefore the caſting vote
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:030223_0005_0FE4FE6C342EE300"/>
remains to be accounted for. Idle ſtories go about: ſlander is ever on the wing: for my part I am not one of thoſe who will give credit to nothing that he cannot ſee through: but I leave a myſtery as I find it. This miraculous converſion is certainly to be attributed to the interpoſition of ſome <hi>inviſible</hi> power; to that power let us return our thanks, and not to Mr. Muhlenberg.</p>
               <p>But though the reſolution for carrying the treaty into effect had paſſed in the committee, it had yet to get through the Houſe, and much apprehenſion was entertained for its ſafety on the paſſage. The oppoſition was determined to diſpute the ground to the laſt inch; accordingly when the reſolution was taken up in the Houſe, on the 30th, <hi>Mr. Dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born</hi> moved the following preamble to it: <q>That although in the opinion of this Houſe the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty is <hi>highly objectionable</hi> and <hi>may prove injurious to the United States,</hi> yet, conſidering all the cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances relating thereto, particularly that the laſt 18 articles are to continue in force only dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the preſent war, and two years thereafter, and confiding alſo in the efficacy of meaſures which may be taken for bringing about a diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the violations committed on our neutral rights, in regard to our veſſels and ſea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, therefore;</q> &amp;c.</p>
               <p>This was the laſt ſhift of a baffled ſaction. <q>If you do carry the treaty, ſaid they your reſolution ſhall contain the proofs of your own folly and incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtency.</q> The plan was well laid: it was expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that ſome of the members, who had voted for the reſolution the day before, would alſo vote for the preamble; nor was this improbable; any in conſiſtency might be expected from ſome of them</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="175" facs="unknown:030223_0006_0FE52B389C3CB2E0"/>Mr. Muhlenberg, as if afraid of being out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtripped by Mr. Chriſtie and ſome others, haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give the preamble his entire approbation, and did at laſt actually vote for it. Thus, we ſee this gentleman, firſt oppoſing the treaty at a town meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and drawing up a memorial beſeeching the Preſident not to ratify it; then we find him voting for a reſolution that declares the Houſe to have a right to ſet the treaty aſide; but, when called on for his caſting voice, he ſeems to have forgotten all about the evil tendency of the treaty and the unmaking power of the Houſe. Sleep, however, ſeems to have refreſhed his memory, and we find him, next day, voting for a preamble, that de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares this treaty <q>highly objectionable, and that it may prove injurious to the United States;</q> but, in leſs than ten minutes afterwards he falls back into his old ſtate of torpidity, and really votes for this very "highly objectionable and injurious treaty," without any modification or preamble at all. What an excellent political weather-cock! He tacks with ten times the celerity of the Indian on the top of his Sugar-houſe.</p>
               <p>When the preamble was put, there appeared ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the counting, or rather miſcounting, of the <hi>"Calm Obſerver" Ayes</hi> 49 and <hi>Noes</hi> 49; con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently, the ſpeaker, Mr. Dayton, was called on for the caſting vote, and he gave it in the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gative.</p>
               <p>Thus, another caſting vote preſerved the honour of the Houſe, as a former one had done that of the nation. But, it muſt be remarked here, that, when the names of the members came to be print<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, it appeared 50 had voted in the negative; ſo that there was a majority againſt the inconſiſtent
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:030223_0007_0FE4FE6DC589C538"/>
preamble, even without the caſting vote of the Speaker.</p>
               <p>Mr. Jekyll, in his account of the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act (Woodfall's Reports for 1794; Vol. 4. p. 12) ſays: <q>this act was firſt obtained by ſomething like a miracle. In one ſtage, it was carried in the upper Houſe by a ſort of <hi>pious fraud:</hi> one of the tellers ſeeing a very <hi>fat</hi> Lord coming in, and knowing him to be a man of <hi>weight,</hi> count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him for <hi>ten.</hi>
                  </q> I ſhould have thought that, for like reaſons, Mr. Muhlenberg had been count<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for <hi>two,</hi> had not the error been by ſubſtraction in place of addition. Whether the <hi>fraud</hi> would have been quite ſo <hi>pious</hi> on this occaſion, as in ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the Act of <hi>Habeas Corpus,</hi> is another thing: yes, Mr. Beckley, that's another thing.</p>
               <p>How the Clerk of the Houſe came to miſcount, or how his miſcounting came to paſs unreproved, when diſcovered, are queſtions well worth aſking. Such miſtakes are not common; nor is it likely that an extraordinary degree of inattentiveneſs would prevail at ſuch an important moment. I do not pretend to dictate to members of Congreſs; but, were I one, I would exert my utmoſt to diſplace a Clerk who would dare to miſtate a vote of the Houſe, though that Clerk ſhould be the very image of <hi>Lord Chalkſtone</hi> himſelf.</p>
               <p>Finally, the reſolution of Mr. Hillhouſe was put, in its original form: <q>Reſolved that the neceſſary laws be paſſed for carrying into effect, the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty concluded between His Britannic Majeſty and the United States.</q>—The <hi>Ayes</hi> and <hi>Noes</hi> were as follows:

               <p>The reſolution paſſed, of courſe, and a commit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tee was appointed to bring in the bills.</p>
               <p>The reader will recollect, that, to know the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al inclinations of the members, be muſt obſerve, who voted for the call for papers, and who did not. In the preſent liſt of <hi>Ayes,</hi> I have marked in <hi>italicks</hi> thoſe members who voted in favour of Mr. Livingſton's <hi>paper motion,</hi> that ſuch as laboured through the heat of the day may be diſtinguiſhed from ſuch as did not drop in until the eleventh hour.</p>
               <p>The Repreſentatives who voted on this memora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble queſtion may be divided into three claſſes: 1. ſtaunch friends of the Conſtitution and the treaty; 2. the converts; 3. the hardened political ſinners.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="179" facs="unknown:030223_0010_0FE52AFAAA3C4568"/>As to the firſt of theſe claſſes I ſhall ſay nothing: the perſons compoſing it are ſo much above all praiſe, that I could not hope to do them juſtice. They will find an ample reward in the ſucceſs of their indefatigable efforts, and in the grateful ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledgements of all their worthy conſtituents.</p>
               <p>The ſecond claſs, or the <hi>converts,</hi> merit but lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle thanks from any body. Their apologies for ſhifting ſides were, as, indeed, apologies generally are, a moſt monſtrous abuſe of words. What, for inſtance, could be more ridiculous than for a man to get up and make a long harangue, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to perſuade <hi>others</hi> to vote againſt the treaty, and conclude with ſaying that <hi>he</hi> ſhould vote for it?—And why?—Becauſe he would not create a diviſion between the different branches of the go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment! ſurpriſing! he had voted for forcing the papers out of the Preſident's hands, he had alſo voted for the reſolution that was to remain as a proteſt againſt the Preſident's refuſing of theſe pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers, and, at laſt, he votes for the treaty in order to cultivate harmony between the different branch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of the government! the gentleman ſeems to have fallen out with the other branches, merely to have the pleaſure of making it up again. This farce may, then, take the name of a comedy late<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly written by a Citizen of Philadelphia: <q>the tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umphs of love; or happy reconciliation.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The fact is, however, this converſion was not owing to a conciliating diſpoſition in the converted. Had it not been for the manly, prudent and well-timed meaſures of the Merchants of Philadelphia,
<pb n="180" facs="unknown:030223_0011_0FE52B5CB8764110"/>
this important treaty would have been ſet aſide.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <p>The following memorial was preſented to the Houſe on the 17th of April.</p>
                     <floatingText type="letter" xml:lang="eng">
                        <body>
                           <head>To the Honourable the Houſe of Repreſentatives of the United States. THE MEMORIAL OF THE SUBSCRIBERS Merchants and Traders of Philadelphia,</head>
                           <opener>Reſpectfully Repreſents,</opener>
                           <p>THAT they have waited, with anxious expectation, to ſee the neceſſary meaſures adopted by your honourable Houſe for carrying into operation the Treaty concluded between the United States and Great Britain, and are now ſeriouſly alarmed leaſt thoſe meaſures ſhould be further delayed or entirely omitted.</p>
                           <p>Under that impreſſion, they deem it incumbent on them to repreſent, That the property of the Merchants of the United States, amounting, upon a moderate computation, to more than five millione of dollars, has been taken from them by the ſubjects of Great Britain, the reſtitution of which, they verily believe, depends, in a great meaſure, upon the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of the Treaty on our part.</p>
                           <p>Independent of this immenſe ſum, they have embarked the principal part of their remaining fortunes in veſſels and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventures, the ſafety of which will, as they apprehend, be materially affected by a refuſal or neglect on the part of the United States to comply with ſtipulations ſo ſolemnly entered into. Beſides their particular intereſts as Merchants and Traders, they feel an intereſt, in common with their fellow citizens of other deſcriptions, in the preſervation of Peace, on which the proſperity of this country depends;—and they ſhould deem themſelves wanting in that ſpirit and indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence which ought ever to characterize freemen, if they for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear, on ſo intereſting on occaſion as the preſent, to expreſs their wiſhes and expectations. They, therefore, with all due reſpect for the Repreſentatives of the People of the United States, beg leave to recommend, that no partial conſiderations of policy may influence their deciſion on this important que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion; but that the Faith, the Honour, and the Intereſt of the Nation, may be preſerved by making the neceſſary provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions for carrying the Treaty into fair and honourable effect.</p>
                        </body>
                     </floatingText>
                     <p>Nor did the Merchants of the Capitol ſtop here: they ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a committee to correſpond with other mercantile towns, and with the back counties of Pennſylvania. This meaſure brought ſuch ſwarms of petitions from the people of property of every quarter of the Union, that the Oppoſition began to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive how little their own ſtrength was.</p>
                  </note> However indifferent the converts might be to the ſuſpenſion of inſurance and the general ſhock given to buſineſs of every kind; however they might af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect to laugh at the alarmiſts, they would have been afraid to return among their conſtituents,
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:030223_0012_0FE52B9DEC5A5308"/>
had they plunged the country into diſtreſs and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion. Very probably their turn for roaſting would have come; they might have ſeen their effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gies dragged about in a dung-cart, with French gold in their hands. Happy might they have thought themſelves, if a juſtly enraged people had confined their vengeance to the burning of images and pictures, when the originals were at hand. Their recantation was, in ſhort, like that of a man who ſees the ſtake and the faggots before him. I look upon their ſupport of government, on the preſent occaſion, as a ſort of verbal conformity with a mental reſervation. Few people are dupes enough to believe them ſincere. The doſe they have ſwallowed with ſo many wry faces, has only ſerved to ſet their gall in motion: the executive branch of government may expect at their hands every check and impediment that diſappointed ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lice can ſuggeſt.</p>
               <p>But, little merit as I aſcribe to the <hi>converts,</hi> and little hope as as I have of their reformation, I
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:030223_0013_0FE52B0492908488"/>
muſt ſtill prefer them to the hardened ſinners; for, though a ſort of death bed repentance, ſuch for inſtance, as that of the <hi>caſting voice,</hi> can never be ſuppoſed to atone for a life of political ſin, yet it is at any rate, leſs offenſive to morality and decency, than to hear the ſons of reprobation blaſpheming to the laſt gaſp, and expiring with curſes on their lips.</p>
               <p>All the 48 members, found in the oppoſition on the definitive queſtion concerning the treaty, will unavoidably meet with the approbation of the French National Convention. They all certainly merit the fraternal hug; but there are ſome of them whom it would be unjuſt to mix promiſcuouſly with the common herd: theſe ought to have a kiſs on both cheeks, while the reſt might be put off with a kiſs on one; or, if French politeneſs will inſiſt upon the <hi>double baiſes,</hi> to all the five kings might ſalute the leaders, while the reſt might be left to the ſkinny-lipped blood ſuckers of the Council of Elders.</p>
               <p>In order to regulate the ceremonial, I ſhall point out thoſe whom I think entitled to the diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed honour of being ſlobbered by the five ſultans; obſerving, once for all, that I do not wiſh to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciate the value of any man's labour, or interfere with any bargain that might be previouſly entered into between the parties. The labourer is worthy of his hire, whether he ſucceeds in his object or not.</p>
               <p>To place the <hi>Italian</hi> at the head of theſe wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thies is an act of juſtice, and an act of juſtice which I have the more pleaſure in performing, as I have lately been accuſed (how falſely every body
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:030223_0014_0FE52B26425561B0"/>
knows) of attempting to ſink that gentleman in the opinion of the public.</p>
               <p>When the treaty-making power was to be attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; or, in other words, when a breach was to be made in the Conſtitution, and ſuch a breach as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver could have been cloſed, the aſſailants ſeemed at a loſs for a leader. Citizen M—ſon ſhrank from the taſk. The eyes of the phalanx at laſt turned towards the <hi>Italian.</hi> Murderers, when preparing for their horrid work, always chooſe, from among their gang, ſome preciouſly ill-looking villain to give the firſt ſtab; that done, they fall on with leſs remorſe, and diſpatch the proſtrate victim. I do not pretend to ſay, that the aſſailants of the Conſtitution acted upon the ſame maxims of phy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiognomy: no, God forbid I ſhould ſay or inſinu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate any ſuch thing: on the contrary, if perſon had any thing to do in the matter, I ſhould rather ſuppoſe that the leader was choſen for his beauty.</p>
               <p>Let, however, the motive to the choice be what it might, that it was a good one we all know. With what art did the <hi>Geneveſe</hi> approach! how did he twiſt and turn, when he found an obſtacle in his way! how did his eyes gliſten, when ready to dart in upon his devoted prey! Thoſe that fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed him had little more to do than to mouth over what they had heard, as the yelping puppies of the pack give tongue, when they hear the cry of the leading old hound.</p>

               <p>Had SOMERVILLE written his beautiful poem of <hi>The Chace</hi> but yeſterday, with the late proceedings of the Houſe of Repreſentatives before his eyes, he could not have made a more apt alluſion than is contained in the above quoted paſſage. The reſt did, indeed, with joint cry approve, and loudly boaſt diſcoveries not their own; but the ſagacious
and indefatigable <hi>Geneveſe</hi> untied the Gordian knot; and, though his game at laſt eſcaped him, he is en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titled to all the honours of the field. The grateful ſportsman, to reward his faithful and laborious cur, claps him on the back and ſpits in his mouth. And ſo out <hi>Italian</hi> ſhall be diſtinguiſhed from his collea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues, by ſome ſuperior reward.</p>
               <p>After the <hi>Geneveſe,</hi> I think we muſt give the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedence to the <hi>Long-man</hi> from New York and the <hi>Short-man</hi> from Philadelphia.</p>
               <p>From the firſt of theſe, who labours under an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme poverty of talents, much could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected. His head is generally thought to be as empty as his purſe ever was; yet, he certainly ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſſed all his fellow labourers, except the cunning <hi>Italian.</hi> He ſet out with <hi>bluſhing,</hi> and I leave any one to gueſs at the efforts that muſt be made to get a bluſh through a ſkin like his. Beſides, where will you find a young man of his pretentions, a kind of creole <hi>Adonis,</hi> as it were, who would riſk his complexion for a ſingle moment? who would ſuffer his pure yellow, his fine golden hue, to be
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:030223_0016_0FE52B3B5B323438"/>
mixed with red, and thus debaſed to a vile copper-colour? who would, in ſhort, ſuffer himſelf to be changed from a guinea to a half-penny? I do not know whether the gentleman has been <hi>accuſtomed to ſuch depreciations</hi> or not; but, if this be the firſt time, ſuch a ſacrifice is, in my humble opinion, worthy of a capital compenſation.</p>
               <p>I did not intend to trouble the reader with re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks on any particular paſſages of this gentlemans' ſpeeches: they are generally ſuch ſtrings of plagiar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſms, that, to cenſure them, you muſt cenſure their authors, and this is ſometimes diſagreeable. One paſſage or two, however, call for obſervation; which I am the more ready to beſtow on them, as they appear to be original.</p>
               <p>The gentleman, in defence of his <hi>paper motion,</hi> told the Houſe, that <q>it was impoſſible to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine that they would not <hi>impeach,</hi> until the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pers were ſeen. Facts might then appear, which would render that an unavoidable meaſure which was not now contemplated. If, for inſtance, inſtead of a treaty with Great Britain, they were now diſcuſing one formed with the Porte, where it is the cuſtom for Miniſters to give and to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive <hi>preſents;</hi> and, on the production of the correſpondence, it ſhould appear that our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter had received a <hi>douceur</hi> (bribe) on the ſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the treaty; would not the Houſe think themſelves obliged to impeach?</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is a ſuppoſition, wound up with an interro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation. Now, let us ſee if we cannot ſuppoſe and put queſtions as well as this <hi>Adonis.</hi>—Suppoſe, then, that the electors of a certain diſtrict or city were
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:030223_0017_0FE52B068392AC40"/>
ſilly enough to chooſe, as their repreſentative, a man at once proud and poor, haughty and mean, inſolent and crawling; ſuppoſe that this man were an inſolvent debtor, who had viſited the inſide of a jail, and who had bilked his creditors by paying them but <hi>three ſhillings in the pound.</hi> Now, ſhould a man like this riſe up in Congreſs, and, adopting the ſentiments, the ſtyle and even the geſticulations of the mob, baſely inſinuate, that a public Miniſter, of unſpotted fame, had received a <hi>bribe</hi> from a fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign prince; what, I aſk, would ſuch a man de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve?—To be cut out, at full length, in a <hi>Living Stone,</hi> and ſtuck up at the corner of the <hi>Fly-Market,</hi> for the boys to throw rotten eggs at, till the ſtatue became as yellow as the original.</p>
               <p>The gentleman declared (and <hi>very ſincerely,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out doubt) that his ſuppoſition was by no means applicable to Mr. Jay; and I declare, with equal ſincerity, that my ſuppoſition is by no means appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to Mr. Livingſton, for whoſe feelings, as the reader muſt have already perceived, I have a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful tenderneſs; a tenderneſs, indeed, that I would wiſh to equal that which he has ſhown for the feelings of the Preſident and Mr. Jay.</p>
               <p>The next paſſage that attracts my attention ſeems to be a ſort of ſide wind eulogy on the five kings and their mild and humane government. <q>All Europe ſays our <hi>Adonis,</hi> was once free; all Europe, with the <hi>exception of France</hi> and Swit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zerland <hi>are now in chains.</hi> Where then, will hiſtorical facts be found to juſtify the charge? In the obſequious Parliament of Britain?</q> &amp;c.— Poor <hi>Adonis</hi> how little does he know about all Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope!—and is it poſſible that any one, pretending
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:030223_0018_0FE52BA8CD776340"/>
to be a reaſonable creature, ſhould yet talk to us about French liberty? a decree launched forth by their merciful lords, the other day, will give us a pretty correct idea of Frenchmens' freedom. This decree bears: <q>that the parents of Emigrants ſhall <hi>now</hi> give up to <hi>the nation</hi> that portion of their property, which <hi>would have fallen,</hi> after their death, to their Emigrant children.</q> Let any one judge from this, whether the poor devils are <hi>in chains</hi> or not. But, why do I cite particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar inſtances of their ſlavery! what occaſion have I here to attempt a contradiction of what every one, even the moſt ignorant of the people, knows to be falſe and ridiculous? "In Turkey, and in Morocco" ſays PLYFAIR, <q>the people know under what deſpotiſm they groan; they know who their rulers are, and they know that whatever injuſtice they may be guilty of towards individuals, they muſt have ſome regard to the general intereſt, to the preſervation of the whole. They have the ſatisfaction too of complaining to a friend in ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret of their misfortunes; but <hi>the miſerable French ſlave,</hi> who thinks himſelf a <hi>free citizen,</hi> does not know who his maſters are. He dares not com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, becauſe all around him conſider that their miſeries are the effects of freedom and philoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phy, and like the Philoſopher Pangloſs, though ruined and miſerable, they have been taught to ſay, that all is as well as poſſible.—Wretched people among whom every thing is at the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition of a gang of intriguing deſpots, who, by means of a printing preſs and reams of Aſſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nats, pillage the nation, and excite to maſſacre and bloodſhed.</q>—This is the only people in Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope who, our <hi>Adonis</hi> tells us, is not in chains! I can aſſure him, that ſuch an aſſertion, at this day,
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:030223_0019_0FE52B623B7008B0"/>
is barely honoured with a ſneer. The people of America have at laſt opened their eyes. They have ſeen French liberty ſeated on her throne, the guil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lotine, ſurrounded with confiſcations, guards, man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acles and dungeons; they have ſeen French religion exhibited in blaſphemies againſt the Almighty and in the adoration of a common proſtitute; they have ſeen French humanity in the form of a child torn from its mothers womb and writing on the point of a bayonet. Yes, and they have ſeen the effects of French gold too, and I can tell you Mr. Living<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſton, that they deſpiſe the corruptor as well as the corrupted. French friendſhip they know they do not want, and French enmity is become the object of their contempt.—To ply them then, Sir, with this old, ridiculous, thread bare tale of French liberty, though it may procure you a <hi>feu de joie</hi> from the hulks at New York, is an inſult to the underſtandings of your conſtituents, for which I much queſtion if even your ignorance will be thought a ſufficient apology.</p>
               <p>But, it ſeems, there is one other nation, beſides the French, who are <hi>not in chains;</hi> the Swiſs.—It is ſomething ſingular that our orator forgot the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>publics of <hi>Batavia</hi> and <hi>Geneva.</hi> They have both the happineſs of having the ſame kind of free go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as his dear France. Their legiſlative and executive branches, and all their offices of ſtate, excepting the prime miniſter, Citizen Guillo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tine, are the ſame. What then, could render them unworthy of being called free nations! how comes Switzerland, the beſt part of which <hi>groans</hi> under an Ariſtocracy, to be prefered to theſe regenerated ſtates, theſe apes of the French republic, theſe firſt
<pb n="189" facs="unknown:030223_0020_0FE52AE7611C0F18"/>
born of the great Baboon?—Our <hi>Adonis's</hi> head was abſolutely turned with his paper-kite motion.</p>
               <p>Never ſurely was poor youth ſo diſcomfitted, ſcouted and routed as he has been during this ſeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. After a months hard labour, the Preſident refuſes him a peep at the papers; he ſeeks venge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, meets a ſecond rebuff, and is at laſt, reduced to the mortification of ſeeing the ſchemes of nine long months overturned in a ſingle moment, in ſpite of the counter efforts of his <hi>worthy</hi> relations, at New York, joined to thoſe of Chocolate grinder and Serjeant Cl—ke. In this ſituation what is he to do!—Jog back quietly to daddy's, make the moſt of his perſonal charms, ogle the fair ſex in place of grinning at General Waſhington, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent himſelf with reading billets doux inſtead of ſtate papers. But, for mercy's ſake, let him take care how he <hi>bluſhes:</hi> "the <hi>bankrupt,</hi>" ſays an au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor "never yet found the fair one kind;" and what then could he expect for a yellow boy who ſhould bluſh himſelf to Jerſey copper?</p>
               <p>Having thus diſmiſſed the long raw boned Knight of the <hi>Woful countenance,</hi> I muſt now beg the rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders reſpectful attention, while I bring on the ſcene probably for the laſt time the little duck legged Squire.—There he is, like a balled ſinger in a fair! don't fright yourſelves, Ladies; upon my ſoul he'll do you no violence. 'Tis as gentle a little creature as you ever ſet eyes on: you may even ſtroke him without apprehending the leſt miſchief; do but liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en to his ſpeech, and he'll lick your hand like a ſpaniel.</p>
               <p>This gentlemans' efforts on the oppoſition may be conſidered as confined to the exaltation of the
<pb n="190" facs="unknown:030223_0021_0FE52B63C1A6A738"/>
                  <hi>magnanimity of the king of Spain,</hi> and that of <hi>his own diſintereſtedneſs.</hi> Indeed, both ſubjects were equally worthy of his ſmall talk eloquence. The magnanimity of a man, who ſhakes hands, in an humble peace, with the murderers of the head of his family, is well matched with the diſintereſted<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of another, who aims at the deſtruction of his country, or at leaſt, of all that is valuable in it, that he may raiſe himſelf on its ruins.</p>
               <p>He told the Houſe, that <q>he had ſeveral veſſels at ſea, not inſured; that he had landed property in great quantity,</q> and hence he took occaſion to conclude, that he could not be ſuſpected as wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to involve the country in a war. This indeed, from a man of moderate views, from a man of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate vanity even, ought to have ſome weight; but, from one like the perſon here ſpoken of, it ought to have none at all.</p>
               <p>There are ſome men, who as the poet ſays, <q>never are at hearts eaſe, while they ſee a greater than themſelves.</q> Such is this gentleman. He muſt be every where, and every where at the head; and, as it commonly happens with thoſe of his ſtamp, nature has abſolutely diſqualified him for the attainment by fair means. Still, however, he drives on towards his object, and in his progreſs em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploys all thoſe little arts that worth and genius diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain. How has he laboured to eſtabliſh for himſelf the character of a man of learning and taſte! how often and how barefacedly has he condeſcended to become his own puff in the common papers! how many letters has he written to diſtant places to inſure the inſertion of articles in praiſe of himſelf! what incredible pains has he taken to procure the
<pb n="191" facs="unknown:030223_0022_0FE52B44AD88FB80"/>
appearance of a ſilly poem, ſigned with his name, in a periodical publication of a foreign country!</p>
               <p>He told the Houſe of Repreſentatives of his ſhips and his lands; he might have told them of his <hi>houſe</hi> too, unleſs indeed, he looked upon that as unne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary, from its being ſo perfectly known. This houſe, which reſembles in furniture a Dutch virtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſo's baby hutch, is become a kind of rareeſhow. The vain proprietor acts the part of a deſpicable ſhowman. This houſe-that-Jack-built is his hobby horſe, and when mounted on it, he is more an ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of ridicule than the whore on the black ram, or poor Gulliver aſtride the nipple of the Brabding<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagian maid of honour.</p>
               <p>Money however he has, and with this he finds his way into almoſt every meeting that bears the name of a <hi>ſociety,</hi> a name, by the by, of which moſt men of ſenſe begin to be heartily tired. Our Lilliputian, with his dollars, gets acceſs where, without them, he would not be ſuffered to appear. But, of all his little baits for admiration and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence, none is ſurely ſo perfectly ludicrous as his becoming the Mentor of the <hi>little miſſes.</hi> That a vain man ſhould condeſcend to cajole the mob, to greaſe the hands of the leaders of a club or ſociety, that he ſhould crawl to news-printers, or even run dangling about after ſpectators to advance his taſty manſion, is not ſo very ſurpriſing: but that he ſhould ſo far defy the power of ridicule as to profeſs himſelf the periodical declaimer at the breakings-up of a boarding ſchool, and even ſhow an uncommon anxiety to have his ſpeeches on thoſe occaſions pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed, is what no mortal could ever have expected, no, not from John Swanwick.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="192" facs="unknown:030223_0023_0FE52B6545561AA8"/>What attention is due to a man like this, when he produces the coincidence of his own intereſt with that of his own country as a proof that his conduct is in conformity to both? ſuch a man feels intereſted in nothing that does not bring food to his vanity, and if a greater quantity of this is to be obtained by the loſs of his property than by its pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention, he will never ſcruple to hazard it; Where then, is his diſintereſtedneſs, and his patriotiſm?</p>
               <p>At firſt glance, one would imagine that a being like this was formed for the contempt, or, at leaſt, for the diverſion of mankind; and, under certain governments, he would, indeed, be harmleſs; but, in a ſtate where all depends upon the popular voice, I do not know a more dangerous character. Of a proud man you have ſome hold; his pride will not let him ſtoop to ſuch meanneſſes, by which alone he can come at the power that makes him formidable; while the vain one will ſtop at nothing. Knowing that the accompliſhments of his hopes depends on the people and that it is to numbers he muſt owe his ſucceſs, he ſpeculates in their errors and their prejudices, and turns them to his own advantage at the expence of the community. No rebuſſ. no ill treatment or diſcomfit diſcourages him: kick him out at your front door, and he will come in at the back: drive him from one office of one aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembly, and he will get into another: ſome where he will be, where he can make himſelf talked of. He is ever the cringing ſlave of power: he adores it in whatever hands it may be found: as he wheedles a democratic populace, ſo would he the crueleſt deſpot on earth; he has not a drop of independent blood in his heart, and he is the mortal enemy of all thoſe who have.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="193" facs="unknown:030223_0024_0FE52BB6D977C680"/>That ſuch a man as this ſhould be the repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative of a State of which I am an inhabitant, is, I muſt confeſs a mortification; as to repreſenting me, however, he never did, nor ſhall he ever do it: therefore, as a fraction of the ſovereign people, I do hereby, once for all, enter my proteſt againſt every thing that he may do, or have a hand in. When he looks round, from his hobby-horſe, on the multitude who have been weak enough to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit their intereſts to his ſapient head and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="1 word">

                  </gap> heart, let him remember, that there is one who would not truſt him with the ſtump of an old worn out pen.</p>
               <p>When I ſee people, who have choſen a repreſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tative like this, brought to the verge of ruin by him and his aſſociates, I cannot ſay I pity them. Many of the Merchants and traders who were ſo alarmed the other day, on account of the oppoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the treaty, had uſed every effort in their power to inſure this man's election. What muſt be their reflections, when they ſaw him, not only voting for the deſtruction of their property and themſelves, but endeavouring to nullify their peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by another, ſigned by foreigners, blackguards and negroes? Surely this ought to be a leſſon to thoſe, who are to chooſe or reject him another time. But, indeed, men of property, men who ought to be of weight, are in this country, as in moſt others, indifferent and ſlothful as to their po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical rights. Whatever may be the cauſe of this, the conſequences are well known, they are already felt, and will from day to day and from year to year be felt more ſeverely.</p>
               <p>Thus, I have endeavoured to juſtify the prefer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to be given to theſe three heroes of the <hi>hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened

ſinners.</hi> Citizen Madiſon was formerly reck<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned as a ſort of chief; but he has ſo ſunk out of ſight this campaign that we can look upon him, at leaſt, as no more than an aide-de-camp. The firm and <hi>indiviſible</hi> phalanx of Virginia were led on by a younger, more bold and more artful comman<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der; had victory decided in their favour, the Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizen would have put in his claim to a ſhare in the glory of the day; but the timely deſertion of the <hi>heavy horſe</hi> of Philadelphia, and the diſgraceful de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat that ſucceded, has left him without even the hope of repairing his reputation. As a politician he is no more; he is abſolutely deceaſed, cold, ſtiff and buried in oblivion for ever and ever.</p>
               <p>There are, then, but three of theſe gentlemen whom I look upon as entitled to the <hi>collade frater<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nelle</hi> from the five kings; the others muſt put up with a ſmack from the <hi>elders</hi> or <hi>youngers.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is one difficulty remaining, which it will not be very eaſy to get over; that is, the parties are at ſuch a diſtance from each other, that to embrace in perſon would be impoſſible, unleſs one or the other would be content to make a voyage; a thing which we cannot expect, for, like the buz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard, neither likes to loſe ſight of their prey. 'Tis true, that, in France, they do embrace by proxy, and probably this may be now reſorted to. We can very well ſpare a deputation, and if they ſhould never return, few, I believe, would mourn their loſs.</p>
               <p>I now bid the oppoſers of the treaty farewel: they and I have been at war for rather better than a year; I have ſeen them completely beaten, and though I pretend to no other merit than the little
<pb n="195" facs="unknown:030223_0026_0FE52B08897CB9E8"/>

               <head>PAINE'S AGE OF REASON.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>The</hi> Chriſtian Religion teaches men to forego their private intereſts for the ſake of doing good, it is not therefore ſurpriſing, that deiſts and atheiſts ſhould forego their private intereſts for the ſake of doing miſchief. Things oppoſite in their nature muſt be expected to be oppoſite in their effects.</p>
               <p>The Editor of the <hi>Aurora</hi> of Philadelphia (Mr. Franklin Bache) has advertiſed for ſale a ſecond part of Paine's Age of Reaſon, at a <hi>low price.</hi> It is ſaid, he has received <hi>fifteen thouſand</hi> copies of this from Paris, and it is very certain that he ſells them at a price which will hardly pay firſt coſt and expences. When I went to ſchool, I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member we had for a copy: <q>Zeal <hi>in a</hi> good cauſe <hi>deſerves</hi> applauſe.</q> If this old maxim be a true one, I would aſk; what <hi>zeal</hi> in a <hi>bad cauſe</hi> deſerves?</p>
               <p>A perſon, to whom the parties were well known has aſſured me, that poor Paine imbibed his firſt principles of deiſm of Doctor Franklin; if ſo, it is poſſible that the Editor of the <hi>Aurora</hi> may look upon the diſtribution of the Age of Reaſon as a means of propagating his Grand Father's princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, and ſo far <hi>ſome perſons</hi> will defend it, as an
<pb n="196" facs="unknown:030223_0027_0FE52B0A0C626518"/>
act of filial piety, or rather filial gratitude, for as to piety I think we may venture to leave it out of the queſtion.</p>
               <p>This grateful young man ſhould, however, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect that a vender of poiſon will not be excuſed merely becauſe the compound was kneaded up, or the receipt for it given, by his anceſtor. Deiſm cannot be well ſaid to run in the blood, or I ſhould really be afraid, that the decendant of the illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous old deiſt was contaminated. Charity bids me to hope the contrary, and to aſcribe the exceſs of his zeal to the amiable motive above mentioned.</p>
               <p>It is going too far, perhaps, to ſay, that any loſs on theſe blaſphemous pamphlets is to fall on Mr. Bache, The French republic has ever ſhown a ſincere deſire of regenerating us, and as ſhe finds us obſtinate in politics, ſhe may be willing to try her hand in another way. The papers have told us lately, that Mad Tom takes up his lodgings at the Houſe of the American Embaſſador; if this ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond part of the Age of Reaſon ſhould have come to us under his auſpices, it is a fact of a curious na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture indeed.</p>
               <p>As to the work itſelf, it cannot be better deſcri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than by ſaying that it is as ſtupid and diſpicable as its author. The wretch has all his life been employed in leading fools aſtray from their duty, and, as nothing is more eaſy, he has often ſucceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. His religion is exactly of a piece with his po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litics; one inculcates the right of revolting againſt government, and the other that of revoking againſt God. Having ſucceeded againſt the Lord's anoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed (I mean his and our <hi>ci-devant</hi> friend the moſt
<pb n="197" facs="unknown:030223_0028_0FE52B6BACD4AF40"/>
Chriſtian king) he turned his impious arms againſt the Lord himſelf. This proceſs is perfectly natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, as has been exemplified in the conduct of others as well as that of Paine.</p>
               <p>How Tom came to think of exerciſing his clum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy battered pen upon the Chriſtian Religion is what has excited a good deal of curioſity, without ever being well accounted for in this country; notwith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, the circumſtances under which a man writes ought to be attended to in forming a judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of his opinions, particularly if thoſe opinions are new and extraordinary. For this reaſon, I ſhall endeavour to trace this raggamuffin deiſt from A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica to his Paris dungeon, and to account for his having laid down the dagger of inſurrection in order to take up the chalice of irreligion.</p>
               <p>Thomas, after having retailed out a good deal of very <hi>Common Senſe</hi> commonly called <hi>Nonſenſe,</hi> found himſelf rather richer than when he began.<note n="*" place="bottom">In his ſecond Part of the Rights of Man, he ſays he has a <hi>place</hi> in the State of Delaware. Whether this be a lye or not I cannot tell; but, if it be true, it was certainly the product of the revolution; for every one knows he had nothing before. This was encouragement for him to try his talent in other coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. A confiscated caſtle in France, or ſome Abbey where he might join ſacrilege to robbery, was a ſufficient temptation to lead him acroſs the ocean.</note> This gave him a ſmack for revolutions; but find<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing himſelf ſinking faſt into his native mud, and pretty univerſally deſpiſed and neglected by the people of this country: finding, in ſhort, that the Americans were returning to order, and feeling that his element was confuſion, he croſſed the At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lantic to baſk in the rays of the French revolution.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="198" facs="unknown:030223_0029_0FE52AE953A89BA8"/>The <hi>Propagande</hi> at Paris, that is, the ſociety in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtituted for the propagation of the vile and deteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble principles of the <hi>Rights of Man,</hi> as laid down in the famous French Conſtitution, fixed their Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobinical eyes on Tom, as an excellent miſſionary for great Britain and Ireland. Off goes Tom with his Rights of Man, which he had the abominable impudence to dedicate to <hi>General Waſhington.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">The <hi>Second Part</hi> was dedicated to <hi>Lafayette,</hi> to which no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body had any kind of objection.</note> The Engliſh Jacobins ſtared at him at firſt: he went a ſtep further than they had ever dreamed of: his doctrines, however, grew familiar to their ears: they took him under their wing, and he made ſure of another revolution. This ſecurity was his misfortune, and had nearly coſt him a voyage to the South Sea.</p>
               <p>From the thief-catchers in England Tom fled, and took his ſeat among the thieves of Paris. Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter having diſtinguiſhed himſelf in execrating the Conſtitution he had written in defence of, he, and two or three others, ſet to work and made a new one; quite brand new, without a ſingle ounce of old ſtuff. This covered Tom with glory ſoon after, when it was unanimouſly accepted by the rich, free, generous and <hi>humane</hi> French nation.</p>
               <p>This may be looked upon as the happieſt part of Tom's life. He had enjoyed partial revolts before, had ſeen doors and windows broken in, and had probably partaken of the pillage of ſome ariſtocra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tic ſtores and dwelling houſes; but, to live in a continual ſtate of inſurrection, <q>ſacred, holy, or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ganized inſurrection;</q> to ſit ſeven days in the week iſſuing decrees for plunder, proſcription and
<pb n="199" facs="unknown:030223_0030_0FE52B9628D1EBB0"/>
maſſacre, was a luxurious life indeed! It was, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, a ſhort life and a merry one: it laſted but five months. The tender-hearted philanthropic murderer, Briſſot, and his faction, fell from the pinnacle of their glory: poor Tom's wares got out of vogue and his carcaſs got into a dungeon.</p>
               <p>This was a dreadful reverſe for old Common Senſe. To be hurled, all in a moment, from the tip top of the <hi>Mountain</hi> of the <hi>Grande Convention Nationale</hi> down to the very bottom of a ſtinking dungeon, was enough to give a ſhock to his poor unſteady brain. But this was not all; he well knew that the national razor was at work, and had every reaſon to ſuppoſe that his days were num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bered. He laid extended on the dirt like a ſheep or a calf in a ſlaughter-houſe, expecting every mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that the Butcher would come for him.</p>
               <p>How Thomas came to eſcape is ſomething that will probably remain a miſtery. It was ſaid, that <hi>Danton</hi> (the new chief tyrant) ſpared his life at the requeſt of certain Americans; but this is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable, not that ſome Americans might be found ſilly enough to petition for it, but becauſe, when his enlargement was afterwards demanded upon the ſcore of his being an American, the ruling tyrants anſwered, that he was a <hi>ſacré Anglois,</hi> a d—nd Engliſhman. The fact is, I believe, Dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton and his party deſpiſed Tom too much to run any riſk of diſobliging their friends in Great Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain and America by taking away his worthleſs life. Be the motive what it might, he was kept in his cage, and there he wrote the firſt part of his <hi>Age of Reaſon.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="200" facs="unknown:030223_0031_0FE52B6FA72B5418"/>Now to the motive that led him to the compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition of this blaſphemous work; which was no other than that of ſaving his ugly uncombed head from the guillotine.</p>
               <p>The reader will recollect, that it was under the reign of <hi>Danton</hi> that the Chriſtian Religion was aboliſhed by a decree. A few days before Tom's impriſonment the famous feſtival of Reaſon was held. A common ſtrumpet was dreſſed up as the <hi>Goddeſs Reaſon,</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">She was guillotined ſoon after.</note> ſeated on a throne of turf, and, while incenſe was burnt before her altar at ſome little diſtance, the idolatrous populace, with the Convention at their head, proſtrated themſelves before her. Not many days before this, the <hi>conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional</hi> Biſhop of Paris,<note n="†" place="bottom">
                     <hi>The</hi> conſtitutional <hi>clergy means the</hi> new clergy, <hi>the</hi> clergy of the revolution, the apoſtates.</note> with his vicars and three rectors, came to the Convention and and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicated their religion, declaring themſelves to have been cheats, and that in future they would profeſs no other worſhip than that of <hi>Reaſon.</hi> In ſhort, <hi>Danton,</hi> and <hi>Robeſpierre</hi> (then ſecond in command) were inceſſantly occupied in extirpating the ſmall remains of Chriſtianity from the minds of the poor brutified and enſlaved French. It was a neceſſary preparation to the bloody work they intended they ſhould execute.</p>
               <p>Citizen Common Senſe knew this, and therefore it was not wonderful that he ſhould attempt to ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en his lot, and prolong, perhaps, his miſerable days, by ſomething from his pen, calculated at once to flatter their vanity and further their exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crable views. Thomas had long railed againſt the baſeneſs of courtiers, but when the moment of tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al
<pb n="201" facs="unknown:030223_0032_0FE52B47B06C8BA0"/>
came he was found as baſe as the baſeſt. The high-minded republican Paine, who had ſet Lords and Kings at defiance, was glad to bend the knee before a vile low-bred French pettifogger. He de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcended to make uſe of the very phraſes that the new tyrants had introduced. The Goddeſs was called <hi>Reaſon,</hi> the church which was profaned by her worſhip was called the <hi>Temple of Reaſon,</hi> and the inſcription on the banners carried at the feſtival was <hi>"The Age of Reaſon"</hi> (Le ſiecle de la Raiſon) the very title of Tom's book. Baſe adulation! adu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation not to be excuſed even by the ſituation in which he was. The old French clergy, with the dagger at their breaſts, ſcorned to purchaſe life at ſuch a price.</p>
               <p>I would by no means be underſtood as believ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that Paine's book was a deſertion of his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples; for, as I before obſerved, he had been cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted years before. It is the diſgraceful motive for publiſhing his creed that I am expoſing. That it was done to make his court to the tyrants of the day cannot be doubted; for, in all his former works, if he has occaſion to ſpeak of the Chriſtian religion, he does it in decent if not reſpectful lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. In his Rights of Man, for inſtance, he extols toleration, and obſerves, that <hi>all religions are good;</hi> but as ſoon as he got into his new-faſhioned ſtudy, a dungeon, he diſcovered that <hi>they were all bad,</hi> or at leaſt the Chriſtian Religion, and it was of the divers denominations of that religion that he before <hi>pretended</hi> to ſpeak. When he ſaid, that all religions were good, he was an abominable hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crite, or he is one now, when he tells us that the Chriſtian Religion is a very bad one. Either he diſguiſed his ſentiments to deceive the Engliſh, or he has ſince done ſo to deceive <hi>Danton</hi> and <hi>Robe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpierre.</hi>
                  <pb n="202" facs="unknown:030223_0023_0FE52B6545561AA8"/>
Tom knows the value of a character for conſiſtency too well to run the riſk of loſing it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs upon a preſſing emergency: but, the guillotine was yet red with the blood of his comrades, and he well knew that there was but this one way of keeping his own corrupted ſtreams within his veins.</p>
               <p>It will be ſaid, by Tom's deiſtical Friends, that the <hi>Second Part</hi> of the Age of Reaſon was written after his releaſement, and at a time when he was in no danger. Very true; but the die was caſt; the <hi>Firſt Part</hi> was out, and there was no recalling it. He had openly attacked both heaven and earth; he could do no more. One eſſay at blaſphemy was as good as a thouſand for eſtabliſhing his new pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenſions to infamy; but Thomas had now ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing elſe to attend to beſides his reputation; I mean his belly. The uſual means of ſubſiſtence had failed: he was no longer a <hi>great</hi> Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive of a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>free</hi> people. The handful of aſſignats he received daily were gone to ſome more ſtaunch patriot, and the old Rights of Man was left to dine where he could. As to political drugs Thomas's were grown out of vogue in France as much as they now are in this country: his conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution was declared to be the moſt ſtupid perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance that ever iſſued from a ſick brain, and its author fell into diſcredit as rapidly as he had riſen to fame.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Inſurrection, revolution, conſtitution,</hi> a knowledge in all theſe ſeems to be a neceſſary qualification in a profeſſor of the <hi>Rights of Man.</hi> Tom Paine underſtood the firſt perfectly well, he had a ſmattering of the ſecond, but as to the third he was, and, if alive is, totally ignorant.</note> Among thouſands of others, he experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>enced the ſudden change in the opinions of the vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>latile Pariſians: from being a ſort of demi-god he was become the moſt degraded thing in nature, a
<pb n="203" facs="unknown:030223_0034_0FE52AEB12FD5400"/>
poor, half-ſtarved deſpiſed pretender to renown. Beſides, the conſtitution that was now coming into play, with a council of youngers and a council of elders and five kings, elected by <hi>people of ſome pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty,</hi> or, at leaſt, ſome <hi>qualification,</hi> was what Tom never could defend with his right of univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal ſuffrage and continual inſurrection, and, for once, he had the prudence to hold his tongue.</p>
               <p>Tom's fate in France was nearly what it had been in America; when it was no longer neceſſary to employ him he ſunk into neglect. Happy if he could have ceaſed eating when his inſurrection ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents became uſeleſs; but as he could not, he muſt continue to write, and as he was in a country where he was permitted to revile none but the Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mighty, the Almighty he reviled. The preſent of poiſon he has ſent to his "fellow citizens" of America, not therefore, ſo much the work of choice as of neceſſity. The Second Part of the Age of Reaſon he wrote, for a living and the Firſt Part he wrote for his life.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who prefer a few years of life to every thing elſe, may find an excuſe for this degraded man: it is impoſſible for any of us to ſay how we ſhould act at the foot of the guillotine. But, what ſhall be ſaid to thoſe, who, preſſed by neither dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger nor want, make uncommon exertions to ſpread his infamous performance among the ignorant part of their countrymen, and thereby ſow in their minds the ſeeds of vice inquietude, and deſpair? Again; deiſts may find ſome apology for doing this; but who will dare to become the apologiſt of thoſe book-ſellers, who, profeſſors of the Chriſtian faith, throw out this bait of blaſphemy to catch un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wary comers, and, ſmiling at their ſimplicity, pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et
<pb n="204" facs="unknown:030223_0035_0FE52B4AA0AA2EC0"/>
the dirty pence. Such men (and they are but too numerous) are like the Hollander on the coaſt of Japan, who, to outſtrip others in trade with the natives, tramples on the croſs of his Saviour.<note n="*" place="bottom">I know a printer and book-ſeller who has taken, for his ſign, the picture of the blaſphemer Paine. This undoubtedly is to inform the <hi>amateurs</hi> of inſurrection and infidelity that they may be ſupplied within. It is no more than fair to impute this intention to him who hangs out ſuch a ſign. When <hi>Caterfelto</hi> placed the picture of the Devil over his door, it was to inform people that hell was to be ſeen in the houſe.</note>
               </p>
               <p>I ſhall here take the liberty of adding an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tract from an addreſs, delivered by <hi>Judge Ruſh</hi> to the Grand Jury of the County of Berks, with which I ſhall diſmiſs this article.</p>
               <q>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> we are told by our law books, is <hi>part</hi> of the <hi>law</hi> of the <hi>land;</hi> and as ſuch a Judge may at <hi>any time,</hi> without ſtepping aſide from the path of duty, il<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſtrate its precepts and enforce its evidences. It muſt therefore be particularly incumbent on him at <hi>this time,</hi> when deiſm is daily venting itſelf in ambiguous hints or ſneers, or openly attacking religion with ſhallow ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument.</p>
                  <p>To the native growth of infidelity among us, it is more than poſſible, augmentations may have been made, in conſequence of our admiration of a certain great na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in Europe, more eſpecially as a member of the late convention in that country (generally ſuppoſed to have been actuated by an uncommon zeal for the Rights of Man,") availing himſelf of his literary re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation, has by an attempt to overthrow all religion, indirectly endeavoured to juſtify their blaſphemous meaſures to extirpate it. It is really aſtoniſhing, Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, that a man who calls himſelf a patriot, ſhould ſtrive to undermine religion, the <hi>only foundation</hi> of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and morality. The penetrating genius of Mont<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſquieu,
<pb n="205" facs="unknown:030223_0036_0FE52BB85B954F50"/>
taught him to entertain ſentiments very differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent from thoſe of the "Age of Reaſon." Having compared the effects on ſociety produced by different religions, and examined them <hi>merely</hi> in a political light; what is the deciſion? "The principles of chriſtianity," ſays he, "deeply engraved on the heart, would be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more powerful than the falſe honour of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies, the humane virtues of Republics, or the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile fear of deſpotic ſtates." The vaſt comprehenſive mind of the great Bacon, ſaw the ſubject in the ſame point of view. "There never was found," ſays this profound philoſopher, "in any age of the world, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther philoſophy, or ſect, or religion, or law, a diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline which did ſo highly exalt the public good, as the <hi>chriſtian faith.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I have already, Gentlemen, conſumed more time than I intended, and ſhall therefore inſtantly cloſe with a ſingle obſervation.</p>
                  <p>If the great duties of truth and juſtice, and the pureſt precepts of morality; if the moſt exalted bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence and unbounded humanity; if ſincerity, candor meekneſs, magnanimity, gentleneſs, and forgiveneſs of injuries, have a native tendency to improve the heart, and diffuſe peace, order, and happineſs among man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind, and are <hi>ſtrictly enjoined</hi> by the Chriſtian religion, as <hi>indiſpenſable conditions</hi> of obtaining the favour of the Deity; what muſt we think of the writer, who has exerted his talents to <hi>leſſen</hi> our motives, or <hi>enfeeble</hi> our obligations to the practice of theſe benificent and god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like virtues?</p>

               <head>FRENCH GENEROSITY.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>On</hi> the 27th of April laſt, there appeared, in the Philadelphia Gazette, an order, ſaid to be iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued by the French Convention (I lump the five kings and council of old ones and council of young ones all together) to the commanders of their privateers, concerning the papers of Mr. <hi>Spillard,</hi> the famous traveller. The perſon who ſends this article to <hi>Mr. Brown,</hi> requeſts him to publiſh it, as <q>
                     <hi>it will be acceptable to</hi> every friend of the French na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, <hi>and of</hi> uſeful diſcoveries.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Before we ſay any thing about the order itſelf, we ought to obſerve, that it is publiſhed to give
<pb n="209" facs="unknown:030223_0040_0FE52B80C5404CA0"/>
pleaſure to the friends of the French, by extolling French <hi>generoſity.</hi> The friends of <hi>uſeful diſcoveries</hi> too are to be obliged, and the paragraphiſt ſeems to hint, that thoſe who are friends of the latter muſt be of the former. I muſt allow that the French have made ſeveral <hi>new</hi> diſcoveries, as, for inſtance, forced-loans, aſſignats, the maximum, requiſitions, revolutionary tribunals, feſtivals to Reaſon, drowning boats, ſhooting <hi>en maſſe,</hi> and the renowned guillotine. While <hi>Spillard</hi> has been employed in exploring the back parts of America, the French have been employed in exploring both back and belly parts of the human body: they have been cutting off the breaſts of women and ſecrets of men; they have been tearing out the heart from the breaſt and the embryo from the womb. Theſe are certainly diſcoveries; but, I imagine, the "friends of France" alone will think them "uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful" ones.</p>
               <p>Now to the <hi>generous</hi> order. After having run on a long while, in the uſual bombaſtical cant of the Convention (but with <hi>leſs vaunting</hi> than former<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly) the order ſays:</p>
               <q>
                  <p>As a philoſophical traveller, he knew the chances of war: he knew how <hi>formidable the cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage of the French was.</hi> By venturing on ſea to reach his country, he undoubtedly puts his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in the <hi>generoſity</hi> of a <hi>great republic,</hi> found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon the love of <hi>virtue,</hi> the <hi>ſciences</hi> and <hi>arts.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>No, <hi>Spillard's</hi> hope ſhall not be in vain, and to have recapitulated here his intereſting labours, is ſufficient to be convinced of the readineſs of his captors to aſſiſt the views of the government. That is a debt which they will acquit in the name of the republic, a <hi>great leſſon</hi> which they
<pb n="210" facs="unknown:030223_0041_0FE52B1C4D495630"/>
will give <hi>to our enemies,</hi> and a great claim to the glory which they will acquire; for a <hi>good action</hi> deſerves as much as a great victory.</p>
               </q>
               <p>The Convention could not, all at once, leave off their old ſtyle. We muſt yet be dunned with the <hi>formidableneſs of French courage;</hi> and poor <hi>Spil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lard</hi> muſt be called a <hi>philoſopher,</hi> a name now ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymous, with cut-throats. They muſt yet keep up their cant about a <hi>great republic,</hi> and their love of <hi>virtue</hi> and of the <hi>arts</hi> and <hi>ſciences.</hi> We have, indeed, ſeen ſome few inſtances of the force of their genius, and of their application, in the <hi>diſcoveries</hi> above ennumerated; but how long is it, I would be glad to know, ſince they have become the pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trons and protectors of the <hi>arts</hi> and <hi>ſciences?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I have a book lying before me from which I ſhall here borrow a ſact or two. The library at Aney was crammed into hogſheads; at Narbonne the books were ſent to the Arſenal; at Fontaine le Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jon the library of the Fuillants was thrown aſide as waſte paper. Many of the libraries of Monks contained editions printed in the firſt days of the art of printing; books, ſold in France for a few crowns, were ſold in London for 125 guineas. A clock <hi>en malachite</hi> was ſold for a trifle, though the only one exiſting. They mutilated or deſtroyed all the famous ſtatues, one in particular that coſt 200,000 livres. At Pont Mouſſon, a large picture, which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>noiſſeurs offered to cover with guineas as its price, was ſold for leſs than two. At Nancy, in the ſpace of a few hours, they broke and burned to the value of 100,000 crowns in books and pictures. At Lyons 800 antique medals of gold were thrown in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the crucible. The antiquities of Arles were de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroyed to come at ſalt-petre.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="211" facs="unknown:030223_0042_0FE52B54C86A8E68"/>One member of this Vandal Convention propoſed to deſtroy the portal of St. Denis; another wanted to kill all the rare animals in the muſeum of Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Hiſtory; a third ſaid he did not like learned men, and that the term was ſynonymous with ariſtocrat; a fourth propoſed, that ſoldiers might be promoted to generals, without being able to write; to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, one of theſe monſters ſaid, that <hi>all men of genius ſhould be guillotined.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Theſe are lovers of the arts and ſciences! Theſe are the repreſentatives of that <hi>great</hi> republic to whoſe <hi>generous</hi> forbearance <hi>Spillard</hi> is to owe the recovery of his papers. Amazing change! Theſe people, who burnt <hi>Horace</hi> and <hi>Virgil</hi> becauſe they had been encouraged by kings, and who deſtroyed the <hi>royal</hi> library, merely becauſe it was royal, are now uſing their utmoſt endeavours to preſerve the papers of <hi>Spillard</hi> for the uſe of a <hi>king,</hi> and, oh, ye gods! for a king of England too! A "deſpot" with whom they were <q>never to make peace, 'till he begged it on his knees, with a halter about his neck!</q>
               </p>
               <p>Kind, forgiving, <hi>generous</hi> fellows! how are they reformed! they who, in the beginning of the war, ſeized on the property, even to the very cloths, of all the Britiſh ſubjects who happened to be in France, and threw their perſons into loathſome priſons, where hundreds of them periſhed; they who, <hi>in the days of their ſucceſs,</hi> iſſued a decree for murdering every Briton taken in the field of action; they, whoſe cannibal agents dug the half rotten body of the brave <hi>General Dundas</hi> from the grave and hung it on a gibbet. Yes, theſe very people are now uncommonly ſolicious to ſave, for an En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gliſh
<pb n="212" facs="unknown:030223_0043_0FE52B73E7BAE600"/>
gentleman, the little memorandums he may have made in his travels!</p>
               <p>How ſhall we poſſibly account for all this? let us ſee if the cloſing ſentence of the extract I have given from their order, will not throw ſome light on the matter. "This will," ſay they, <q>give a <hi>great leſſon to our enemies;</hi> for a <hi>good action</hi> de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerves as much as a <hi>great victory.</hi>
                  </q> So, ſo! dad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy <hi>Merlin</hi> is coming round, is he? a great leſſon of <hi>generoſity</hi> is to be given to their enemies, and this good action is to yield them as much as a great victory? this is what you may call coaxing. No, no; none of your good actions; keep them for your friends, and your great victories for your enemies.</p>
               <p>And do I live to ſee the <hi>Grande Convention Fran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coiſe</hi> wheedling "the <hi>nation of ſhop-keepers?</hi>" The people of that devoted Carthage, which they pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed us they would deſtroy? they may wheedle long enough: Billy Pitt has not forgotten that his head was to be brought before them, as a preli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minary to any peace they might <hi>grant</hi> to the "ſhop-keeping nation:" he has not forgotten that they guillotined him in effigy along with his royal Maſter. Billy's turn is come: he may now ſay to them, in one of Shakeſpeare's characters: <q>And thus, my lads, the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.</q>
               </p>
               <p>When the reader compares their <hi>patronage</hi> of the arts and ſciences, in their own country, and their <hi>generoſity</hi> ſhown towards the Engliſh, in their proſperous days, with their <hi>pretended</hi> motives ſet forth in this generous order, I am perſuaded he
<pb n="213" facs="unknown:030223_0044_0FE52B564A382A48"/>
will attribute their change of conduct to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per cauſe.</p>
               <p>Pray then, Mr. Brown the gazette man, let us hear no more of your French generoſity. For ſhame, Sir! how can you ſuffer your fine large gazette to talk about French virtue? tell your cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſpondent, if he ſhould peſter you with ſuch ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther paragraph, that the bore is diſcovered. Tell him that the "friends of France" are very much reduced in numbers, and are daily and hourly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing. Tell him, above all, that nothing can keep the ſans-culotte cauſe alive but an immediate ſupply of the ready; that the "friends of France" are not to be ſatisfied with mere ſounds of <hi>genero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity;</hi> that fraternity and flattery go but little way at the ſhambles or the grog-ſhop, and that, in ſhort, flour merchants or not flour merchants, they all prefer "ſolid pudding to empty praiſe."</p>

               <head>REMARKS. On the poetical Works of <hi>John Swanwick</hi> af Phila<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delphia.</head>
               <p>
                  <hi>In</hi> the laſt Cenſor I made my readers a ſort of half promiſe to give them ſome account of the poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical works of Mr. Swanwick, and I am now pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring to fulfil it.</p>
               <p>Theſe works are, as yet, confined to a poem, which is to be found in the Gentleman's Magazine for June, 1795, publiſhed by <hi>Sylvanus Urban</hi> of the city of London. The reader will be ſurpriſed that a poem, written in Philadelphia, ſhould be export<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="214" facs="unknown:030223_0045_0FE52BBFCDA74128"/>
to England for publication: I was and am yet ſurpriſed at this; and ſtill more, that <hi>Citizen</hi> Swanwick ſhould ſend his works to the editor of a <hi>Gentlemen's</hi> Magazine. He had heard, I preſume, that this is the repoſitory of moſt of the little fugi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive pieces written by men of learning and genius, and ſo he condeſcended to enrich it with a piece of his own. This was certainly generous in him, if we recollect what a hatred he has for all that is <hi>gentleman-like.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The poem is entitled: <q>The proſpect of ſeeing the Fine Arts flouriſh in America.</q>—After hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing ſpoken of the epoch, when the artiſts of Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica ſhall ſtay at home <q>to finiſh the glories of the riſen day of Columbia,</q> our author, by a hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py tranſition, turns our eyes to what we already poſſeſs:
<q>
                     <l>"But ſee what <hi>flow'rets</hi> we already claim,</l>
                     <l>"What lovely <hi>harbingers</hi> of future fame!</l>
                     <l>"Behold <hi>philoſophy's</hi> bright temple riſe,</l>
                     <l>"And fanes to learning every where ſurpriſe;</l>
                     <l>"What <hi>ſchemes of charity</hi> the ſoul excite</l>
                     <l>"To acts of bounty, and unmix'd delight;</l>
                     <l>"Some <hi>to the jail with pitying ſteps repair,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>"To miniſter to <hi>woes</hi> that <hi>languiſh</hi> there:</l>
                     <l>"Others <hi>the bed of raging illneſs ſmooth,</hi>
                     </l>
                     <l>"And the worſt pangs of human <hi>ſorrow ſooth.</hi>"</l>
                  </q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus, then, <hi>Schemes of charity, Viſiting the Jail,</hi> and <hi>Miniſtering to the Sick</hi> are, by Mr. Swanwick called "<hi>flow'rets,</hi> the lovely <hi>harbingers</hi> of fame;" and hence are to ſpring the <hi>fine arts.</hi> Never did I before hear that <hi>poor-houſes, jails</hi> and <hi>ſick beds</hi> were places for cultivating or encouraging the <hi>fine arts.</hi> Mr. Swanwick may there practiſe fine arts, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps,
<pb n="215" facs="unknown:030223_0046_0FE52BC45C37F408"/>
ſuch as are neceſſary to gain him votes at an election; theſe are very fine arts indeed.—But ſtop, there are more of theſe arts to come yet.</p>
               <q>
                  <l>"Some to fair freedom <hi>living altars raiſe,</hi>
                  </l>
                  <l>"And bid <hi>the negro</hi> celebrate her praiſe:</l>
                  <l>"Others the <hi>farmer</hi> with their cares embrace,</l>
                  <l>"And pay due homage to his uſeful race;</l>
                  <l>"Some <hi>manufacturers and their arts</hi> protect,</l>
                  <l>"Others <hi>humane</hi> eſtabliſhments erect.</l>
                  <l>"But ceaſe <hi>the Muſe!</hi>—"</l>
               </q>
               <p>Our poet alludes to the <hi>negro ſociety,</hi> or abolition ſociety, as it is called; and, I am ready to allow it a place among the harbingers of the fine arts. This ſociety is, indeed, a nurſery for ſome of the fineſt arts ever practiſed either in Europe or Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica. But, how comes our author to number <hi>farm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>manufacturing</hi> among his fine arts? Plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and grubbing and making anchors and cables, or grinding ſnuff or boiling up ſugar; theſe do not ſeem to me to be <hi>fine</hi> arts. After theſe come <hi>"humane eſtabliſhments;"</hi> and, though theſe had been before enumerated, Mr. Swanwick muſt thus ſum them up together and expreſs them over again, for fear we ſhould imagine that he did not look on them as mere tricks of art. Mercy on us! who ever heard before, that <hi>humane</hi> eſtabliſhments were among the hot-beds of the fine arts!</p>
               <p>So much for the vein of abſurdity running through this metre: now to the Nonſenſe.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Miniſtering</hi> to <hi>woes</hi> may be a fine art, but, when we are told that theſe woes <hi>languiſh,</hi> what are we to think of the fine artiſt? to <hi>languiſh</hi> is to <hi>pine away,</hi> to <hi>droop,</hi> to <hi>ſink under affliction.</hi> Now, can it be ſaid that a woe <hi>pines</hi> and <hi>droops?</hi> let us change
<pb n="216" facs="unknown:030223_0047_0FE52B57CDD65008"/>
the principle words in this line for ſuch as are ſy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonymous with them, but rather more familiar, and we ſhall be ſtruck, nay, knocked down with the nonſenſe.</p>
               <q>"To <hi>ſuccour pains</hi> that <hi>pine</hi> in the jail."</q>
               <p>I could ſay ſomething about the <hi>raging</hi> illneſs of <hi>ſorrow,</hi> and ſorrow <hi>ſtretched upon a bed</hi> too, but I haſten on to the <hi>living altars</hi> of freedom. The poet tells us, that the ſlave ſociety raiſe living altars to freedom, and then bid <hi>the negroes</hi> celebrate her praiſe. Now, what are theſe <hi>living altars?</hi> why, the perſons freed, <hi>the negroes themſelves;</hi> and ſo, theſe kind gentlemen bid <hi>the altars praiſe the god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſs!</hi>—They will ſtand in no need of prieſts at any rate.</p>
               <p>With reſpect to the <hi>farmer,</hi> I will leave it to the experience and good ſenſe of the reader to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, whether it be either uſual or fitting to <hi>pay homage</hi> to the race of him <hi>whom we have taken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our care and patronage.</hi>—Our poet often makes uſe of figures of rhetoric, but that of the <hi>galimati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as</hi> is the only one he has perfectly at command. It requires neither learning nor taſte to diſcover that he has a plentiful lack of both.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Butler,</hi> in remarking on the verſes of the would-be poets of his time, ſays they made one line for <hi>ſenſe</hi> and one for <hi>rhyme.</hi> It is certain that this is a moſt ſure mark of ſterility; but our little man goes a ſtep further, or rather falls a ſtep ſhort, of this: he has one line for <hi>rhyme</hi> and the other for nonſenſe.</p>
               <p>This piece of rhyming proſe I do not ſcruple to pronounce the moſt miſerable attempt at verſifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="217" facs="unknown:030223_0048_0FE52BC2AF047020"/>

Certain I am that if old Sylvanus Urban had been acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with our little author's principles in politics, he never would have ſuffered his chiming to enter his repoſitory.</p>
               <p>Had this been a piece ſcratched out in a hurry and ſent away to the news-paper, one might have winked at its faults, one might have yawned over its inſipidity and thrown it aſide; but here is a ſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>died trap for fame; this poor dull morſel had been copied over a hundred times, perhaps, before it was ſent all the way to Old England. I think I ſee the little poet now, ſcratching his head and gnawing his pen, telling his fingers and ſearching his rhyme book. Alas! Mr. Swanwick, people do not make poetry this way. They may hammer out lines 'till they clink, but as to poetry it never was hammered out of a dull brain.</p>
               <p>What is moſt laughable, is, to hear the little man calling out upon the <hi>Muſe.</hi>—"But <hi>ceaſe</hi> the <hi>Muſe!</hi>" as much as to ſay that the <hi>Muſe</hi> had inſpired the ſmall-beer verſes we have above extracted! It is with rapture I hear Milton invoke the heavenly Muſe, or Shakeſpear wiſhing for a Muſe of fire; but when, at the end of fifty lines of vapid metre, I hear the little whiffling poetaſtor calling on his Muſe to ceaſe her courſe, a ſneer contracts the muſcles of my noſe, in ſpite of all my complaiſance and compaſſion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="218" facs="unknown:030223_0049_0FE52B79AD23E0B0"/>If Mr. Swanwick reckons the noble art, taught by the famous <hi>Martinus Scriblerius,</hi> I mean the <hi>art of ſinking in poetry;</hi> if he reckons this among the fine arts, I congratulate him on having brought it to perfection, for he has certainly rolled from the very bottommoſt ſtep of the <hi>Bathos.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Thus it is to be a pretender to univerſal genius without having any genius at all. Inſtead of get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting renown a man gets himſelf laughed at. It is a real misfortune: Mr. Swanwick might have been happy all his days as a <hi>Tide Waiter;</hi> but, from his dabbling in a variety of <hi>arts</hi> for which he is not calculated, he will moſt probably preſerve through life that character ſo deſpicable among partizans; <q>a <hi>Jack</hi> of all trades and <hi>maſter</hi> of none.</q>

               <p>
                  <hi>Since</hi> the autumn of 1793, we have heard talk about little elſe than Britiſh depredations on the American commerce. Moſt of the news-papers have been crammed with phillipics againſt the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſh government on this account; the nation have been called thieves and their king the great ſea-robber. This was not very decent language, but even this was ſurpaſſed by certain members of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, who ſeemed to vie with each other in the uſe of that ſort of rhetoric uſually called <hi>Billings<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate.</hi> I have their ſpeeches now before me, but the extracts I would wiſh to give from them are too lengthy, and I ſhould be ſorry to mutilate ſuch elegant compoſitions.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="219" facs="unknown:030223_0050_0FE52B281D437C50"/>I am the laſt on earth that would attempt to ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtify injuſtice, I cannot therefore be thought to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the depredations of the Britiſh: but, at the ſame time I know they have been a thouſand times falſly accuſed, that every art has been made uſe of to exaggerate their violences, that the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of veſſels taken by them has been counted fifty times over, and that language has been imput<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to them which they never held.</p>
               <p>Nor can the Britiſh be juſtified by ſaying that they have done no more than imitate the French; but, we muſt be permitted to wonder that the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations of one nation ſhould excite ſuch a live<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſentment as to puſh the country within a hair's breadth of a war, while equal depredations on the part of France ſhould excite not the leaſt diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent, except among the merchants immediately feeling the loſs. At the very moment that the members of Congreſs were execrating the ſea-rob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of Britain, and ordering General Confiscation and Admiral Embargo to take up arms againſt them; at this very moment the depredations of our dear, generous, <hi>humane</hi> and <hi>pure fingered</hi> allies had committed greater havock and acts of diſhoneſty than "the king of pirates" (to uſe a legiſlative ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion) or his ſubjects, had ever done. I have in another work quoted the report delivered to the Houſe of Repreſentatives on this ſubject, ſtating <q>that the French had not only been guilty of <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>predations equal to thoſe of</hi> the Britiſh, but that they had, beſides, violated the treaty between the two countries, and had, moreover, cheated the American merchants by diſcharging in de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preciated aſſignats a contract which ſhould have been diſcharged in coin.</q>
               </p>

                  <pb n="220" facs="unknown:030223_0051_0FE52B99AA8EFD30"/>When this report came to be examined, every <hi>uncorrupted</hi> man was aſtoniſhed to hear members fall upon the Britiſh tooth and nail, while they were ready to give the <hi>baiſes fraternel</hi> to the robb<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Garmagnoles.

               <p>The merchants, however, though generally par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial enough towards the <hi>grande republique,</hi> ſtill re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collected the loſs, which has been ever ſince in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſing.

That the uſual courſe is after taking the cargo by force and dureſs to detain the veſſels under pretence of paying in produce, until the maſters and crews are wearied with idleneſs, ſickneſs, delay, <hi>and inſult,</hi> ſo as to be willing to return either altogether without pay, or with ſuch ſmall portions thereof, as ſcarcely to pay the freight and charges oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſioned by theſe long delays; whereby in moſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances the whole capital has been left behind, and in thoſe inſtances where a conſiderable part of the cargo has been paid for in Colonial produce, the expences of demurrage have conſumed almoſt the whole, as by vouchers ready to be laid before the Houſe or a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mittee thereof will abundantly appear.</p>

That although your memorialiſts are perfectly ſatisfied that the Executive authority of the Union hath done all within its power to procure re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſs to your memorialiſts, yet it has not had the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired effect.</p>
                     <p>Your memorialiſts further repreſent that they had hoped that ſome arrangement would have been aſſent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to, whereby the debt due from the Republic of France to the citizens of America might have been diſcharged out of the debt due to her from the Unit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed States, and under this expectation they <hi>exerciſed patience,</hi> but finding that money funded and <hi>transferr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to an agent of the republic,</hi> all hope from that reſource is vaniſhed.</p>
                     <p>Your memorialiſts feel the more concern that while <hi>proviſion has been made by the Executive of the Union for obtaining from other nations</hi> a <hi>redreſs for ſpoliations</hi> committed on their commerce, no meaſures adopted have been ſucceſsful for procuring ſimilar ſatisfaction from that nation which the merchants of this have ſhewn <hi>ſo decided an affection to,</hi> by ſupplying their iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lands with proviſions and neceſſaries at a <hi>greater riſk than attended any other branch of their trade,</hi> ſupplies that were abſolutely neceſſary to their Colonies and which they could from no other place nor in any other manner be furniſhed with.</p>

               <p>Some people will pity and others will laugh at theſe memorialiſts; the French republicans will be among the latter. Upon my word, it was very cruel of our dear allies, after having received ſuch proofs of our "ſo <hi>decided affection,</hi>" to cheat and inſult us even more than the "great ſea-robber"
<pb n="223" facs="unknown:030223_0054_0FE52B8A27D328F0"/>
did I after the patriotic and affectionate captains had run the gauntlet, as it were, to get in to the ports of their dear friends and allies to ſave them from ſtarv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, how ſilly they muſt look to have their cargoes ſeized, and be themſelves thrown into a dungeon! this was often the caſe. I have once before ſaid, that the Carmagnoles called them, <hi>les capitaines à coup de bâton,</hi> or <hi>caned captains;</hi> juſt as their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vention called the Pruſſians, <hi>les ſoldats à coup de bâ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> or <hi>caned ſoldiers.</hi> Indeed, they did often kick and beat theſe captains, and, though the poet tells us that ſuch kind of blows wound honour more than any other, yet we have never heard this called a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional diſgrace: on the contrary, the more theſe fellows were kicked, the louder did they cry <hi>long live the Republic,</hi> and the more lies did they bring us in her favour.</p>
               <p>The hearts of the patriots at home partook of the inſenſibility of the backs and poſteriors of the gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lant mariners, and, had it not been for this after-clap memorial of the merchants, the whole would have ſunk into oblivion.</p>
               <p>Some perſons of extraordinary patriotiſm went ſo far as to apologize for the conduct of the French; as thus: <q>The mother country engaged in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bating deſpotiſm at home, and endeavouring to calm thoſe troubles which exiſt in her boſom, cannot pay ſufficient attention to the filling the offices in the iſland with honeſt and upright cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters, otherwiſe they certainly would not ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer the conduct purſued. This is proved by the <hi>honourable and very ample payment for damages and demurage made to Americans detained in their ports.</hi> They are therefore not implicated in the
<pb n="224" facs="unknown:030223_0055_0FE52AF7A3A3C398"/>
charge of depredation.</q> (See the <hi>Aurora</hi> of 28th. May 1795.)</p>
               <p>Now, Great Britain was at war in Europe as well as France was, why then was not the ſame apology applicable to her? but, this apologiſt ſays, that <hi>ample payment was made for damages,</hi> &amp;c. If this be true the memorialiſts are miſtaken, for they ſay there are <hi>two millions</hi> of dollars yet unpaid in May 1796. I know very well that the French promiſed to pay amply: I recollect that, when Mr. Randolph's report (the ſubſtance of which I have above noticed) was publiſhed, it was accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied with a note from his <hi>intimate friend</hi> Fauchet, declaring the readineſs of the French Republic to make immediate compenſation. This had the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired effect, for, though a ſingle farthing will ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be paid, the declaration was looked upon as an acknowledgement of the debt and as a ſecurity for the future; while the Engliſh miniſter, not dar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to make a promiſe which he was not ſure would be fulfilled, was obliged to remain ſilent, and his ſilence was conſidered as a proof that his court not only authorized, but was reſolved to continue its depredations. But, how deceitful are appearances! he that promiſes every thing pays nothing, and he that promiſes nothing pays every thing.</p>
               <p>Either the apologiſt tells us a falſehood or the merchants tell us one. I have no great inclination to interfere with the matter: I leave them to ſettle it between themſelves; or if they ſhould be obliged to call in an umpire, none is ſo proper as the dear nation for whom they both have <q>ſhown ſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cided an affection.</q>

               <p>This intelligence, if true, at once decides the queſtion of French influence and corruption; it is therefore of the utmoſt importance to form a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rect opinion concerning it. Let us firſt ſee what claims the letter itſelf has to authenticity, and then, whether the alarming information it contains be corroberated by facts already known.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="227" facs="unknown:030223_0058_0FE52B299ECFCD58"/>The gazette in which this extract firſt appeared is remarkable for its impartiality. The Editor is a man of much experience in his buſineſs, and en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joys a high reputation for candour and underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It is not probable that ſuch a man ſhould be deceived with reſpect the authenticity of the let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and it is ſtill leſs probable, that he ſhould be prevailed on to print it, not believing it authentic. The manner, too, in which he introduces it to the public, ſeems to me to be a ſtrong proof of his perſuaſion, that it would be ſoon followed up with a more explicit account. Indeed, had he not be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved that the whole affair muſt finally come to light, it is hardly credible that he would have haz<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arded a piece of intelligence reflecting ſuch indeli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble diſhonour on a portion of his countrymen, and not capable of anſwering any good purpoſe what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever.</p>
               <p>The Editor has never ſhown himſelf the enemy of France. He has not indeed, like hundreds of others, approved of the maſſacres in that country; but the inſtant thoſe maſſacres ceaſed, he contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted his dole of praiſe to the triumphant <hi>moderates.</hi> He was among the firſt to oppoſe the principles of the preſent conſtitution in France to thoſe of our Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cobins; and though he was miſtaken here, though he was oppoſing miſchief to miſchief, the miſtake proves, that the preſent French government had his appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bation, and as it ſtill continues the ſame it muſt ſtill have that approbation. There is then, no reaſon to ſuppoſe that he would lend his hand to a fabri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation tending to diſcredit the French government. In truth, he is over cautious in ſpeaking of it: if the intelligence be true, the hardeſt terms he has for conduct of ſuch an infamous and treacherous nature are, <hi>"unkindneſs and imprudence."</hi> A man

who could ſo far get the better of the feelings he muſt entertain upon the ſight of this intelligence, is rather to be ſuſpected of a partiality for, than againſt the French government.</p>
               <p>The Editor of the <hi>Minerva</hi> has, 'tis true, been a bold and able defender of the Britiſh treaty; he might therefore be ſuppoſed to be anxious for its ſucceſs, as all men are zealous in a cauſe they have decidedly eſpouſed; but, this cauſe ſtood no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er in need of ſupport when the extract appeared, the treaty having paſſed the Houſe of Repreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives ſixteen days before. Had this intelligence been a mere invention to ſtir the people up againſt the oppoſition, or rather againſt their deſtructrive projects, it ſhould have made its appearance at the time when petitions were handing about for and againſt the treaty. At that time ſuch a battery might have been opened to good purpoſe; but, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the treaty was ſanctioned, it would have been playing it off upon the defeated and the dead.</p>
               <p>In ſhort, there is no reaſon whatever to ſuppoſe, that the Editor would have publiſhed the extract, believing it a fabrication; and as it is almoſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible he ſhould be duped by any fabricator, we muſt believe it authentic, eſpecially when we ſee the intelligence contained in it ſtrongly corroborated by facts already moſt clearly and unequivocally aſcer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained.</p>
               <p>It is certain that every American who loves his country, and who conſequently feels a deep con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern for its honour, muſt be fired with indignation upon hearing, that <q>certain influential men on this ſide of the water had invited the French govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="229" facs="unknown:030223_0060_0FE52B9B2C5E3B08"/>
to <hi>force</hi> the government of America to ſet aſide the treaty, and that the French rulers had liſtened to the propoſal;</q> but the Editor of the <hi>Minerva</hi> muſt excuſe me, if I think it rather ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſing, that he ſhould imagine either one or the other "impoſſible." Says he, <q>it ſeems impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble that any American citizens could be ſo loſt to all ſenſe of virtue and duty, as to endeavour to bring upon their country ſo great an evil, and it ſeems leſs probable, that the government of France ſhould ſo far forget our rights as an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependant nation, and be ſo unmindful of the ſpirit and genius of freedom as to be diſpoſed to follow the pernicious advice.</q> Now, the truth is, that what is here repreſented as next to impoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible is no more than a continuation of what we have been witneſſes of during four ſucceſſive years.</p>
               <p>In order to form a correct opinion as to the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bability of the truth of the intelligence from Paris, we muſt go back to the epoch when the ruinous and ruined French nation was firſt <hi>called</hi> a Repub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic,<note n="*" place="bottom">I ſay <hi>called,</hi> becauſe France is no more a Republic in real<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity than Turky or Morocco, or any other deſpotic ſtate.</note> and trace down the chain of the machinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of its tyrants to the moment, when the hoſtile determination, the <hi>ne plus ultra</hi> of impudence and of perfidy is ſaid to have been formed.</p>
               <p>When <hi>Briſſot</hi> and his colleagues declared war againſt Great Britain, Holland and Spain they form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the plan of forcing this country to make a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon cauſe with them. For this purpoſe Citizen Genet was ſent out to replace Mr. Ternant, bring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with him the neceſſary inſtructions, and the
<pb n="230" facs="unknown:030223_0061_0FE52B8BA894CF28"/>
ſtill more neceſſary <hi>rouleaux</hi> of <hi>Louis d'ors.</hi>
                  <note n="*" place="bottom">Some time ago, I had a note ſent me, giving an account of the depoſit as well as the removal of certain <hi>rouleaux,</hi> ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companied with a poem entitled <q>the confeſſions of <hi>François Louis d'or.</hi>
                     </q> The author has my thanks for both; but want of room has delayed their publication for the preſent.</note> As it was foreſeen that the Executive of the United States would reſolutely oppoſe the overtures for war, Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net was to effect by force what could not be effect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by perſuaſion. If the government of America was ready to aid the cauſe of France it was to be reſpected, but if not it was to be deſtroyed by ſtirr<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing up the people to oppoſition.</p>
               <p>Inſtead, therefore, of coming directly to the ſeat of government, the Citizen landed at one of the ports the moſt diſtant from it, and in a part of the Union the moſt likely to be led aſtray by his ſeductive and ſeditious arts. On his arrival he found a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamation of neutrality, ſtrictly forbidding the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of theſe States to do any thing contrary to their duty as a nation at peace with all the world; but, in place of acknowledging this right of a neutral nation, what did he do? He iſſued Letters of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que and military Commiſſions: by ſea he ſent Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ricans to cruiſe on the Britiſh, and by land to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vade the Spaniſh dominions. His journey through the Southern States was a kind of triumphal pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion, and he at laſt made his public entry at Phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ladelphia more like a viceroy or a conqueror than a foreign miniſter.</p>
               <p>His introductory letter to the Secretary of State was a clear declaration of his intenſions. "When," ſay he, <q>the emiſſaries of our <hi>common enemies</hi> are making <hi>uſeleſs efforts</hi> to <hi>neutraliſe</hi> the gratitude of your fellow citizens, &amp;c.</q> This language was
<pb n="231" facs="unknown:030223_0062_0FE52BC739460490"/>
an unequivocal proof that he deſpiſed the Preſident and his proclamation of neutrality, and that he depended on the people for ſupport. Accordingly his endeavours were all directed towards this one object, exciting diſcontent and diſobedience.</p>
               <p>Thoſe who had ſucceeded in deſtroying one go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment by the infernal agency of Jacobin clubs, knew their utility, too well to neglect employing them againſt another. The Jacobins had hurled the king of France from his throne, and the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mocrats might hurl General Waſhington from his chair. It is ſomething truely ſingular, that a cele<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brated <hi>atronomer</hi> and a <hi>ſecretary of ſtate</hi> ſhould be the <hi>preſident</hi> and <hi>ſecretary</hi> of the mother-club in each country; it is, however, a fact: <hi>Bailly</hi> and <hi>Dumouriez</hi> once filled thoſe honourable poſts in France, as <hi>David Rittenhouſe</hi> and <hi>A. J. Dallas</hi> did in the firſt club that was formed in America.</p>
               <p>On the plan, and at the recommendation, of the mother-club at Philadelphia, others were formed all over the Union. Their affiliations were as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect in their nature as thoſe of the Jacobins in France, or of the Reformers in England and Scot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, and the principles and object of all were the ſame. It would be tedious to enter into a detail of their manoeuvres, and diſagreeable alſo, as it would not fail to bring to mind the conduct of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny perſons who now wiſh their folly to be forgotten.</p>
               <p>When the Citizen ſaw that the clubs were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come numerous, and thought that things were ripe, he made an open avowal of his intentions of <q>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pealing from the Preſident to the people.</q> This precipitant avowal, dictated by French vanity, hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pily diſconcerted all his plans. The hectoring mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter
<pb n="232" facs="unknown:030223_0063_0FE52B8D2AEFB300"/>
was miſtaken; he thought he had the poor doltiſh Pariſians to deal with; but he was ſoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced of the contrary. The people of America, though their partiality for the French nation, and their ſtill greater partiality for what they <hi>then</hi> ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gined to be the cauſe of freedom, had led them into innumerable fooleries, and diſtinctors as unwiſe as unjuſt, ſhowed, when it came to the trial, that they had too much love for their country, and for their friend and father to eſpouſe the cauſe of a man who aimed at the deſtruction of both.<note n="*" place="bottom">The French republicans aſſert, with their uſual inſolence, that the <hi>people</hi> of this country began to expreſs their diſlike to Genet only when they found he was recalled. This is falſe. The democratic ſocieties, indeed, played him this trick; but the <hi>people</hi> expreſſed their deteſtation of his conduct, and that moſt unequivocally too, the inſtant he talked of his <hi>appeal.</hi>
                  </note>
               </p>
               <p>From the moment the inſolent Briſſotonian found himſelf baffled, his myrmidons began to cry havock. They attacked the citizens of Charleſton at the door of their play-houſe, cut the traces of their coach-horſes, wounded ſeveral perſons, and if I am not miſtaken killed one or two. The militia were call<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed out, and the city was ſtruck with terror. Not long after an American had his ſkull cleft on board of one of their veſſels, for a pretended <hi>inſult to their tricolored cockade.</hi> Many perſons of this city of Philadelphia had the mortification to ſee their peace officers hacked with ſwords in the middle of the ſtreet.<note n="†" place="bottom">How all the offenders came to eſcape puniſhment is a queſtion to be put to the governor of Pennſylvania and others, who ought to have ſeen the laws executed.</note> And yet we are now told that <q>it ſeems <hi>impoſſible</hi> that the government of France ſhould attempt any thing againſt our neutrality.</q>

                  <pb n="233" facs="unknown:030223_0064_0FE4FE64D115F660"/>I know I ſhall be told here, to make a diſtinction between the rulers in France and their miniſters in this country; and I would do this, if I ſaw the leaſt reaſon for ſo doing; if I were not well convinced that the latter have in no caſe ſurpaſſed their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtructions. The friends of the French government make this diſtinction, and tell us that Genet was <hi>recalled</hi> for his miſconduct. The turbulent miniſter was, indeed, <hi>diſplaced;</hi> but the manner of doing this fully proves, that it was a matter of expedien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and not of choice. His maſters, and the maſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers of unhappy France, could not reject the Preſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents' requeſt, without diſguſting the people of this country, who muſt have looked on ſuch a ſtep as a decided mark of approbation of Genets' inſolence; nor could they call home without puniſhing him. Therefore, at once to preſerve the good will of the Americans and avoid the puniſhment of a man whoſe conduct they did in reality approve of, they diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſed him from his employment and left him qui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>etly amongſt us, where, beſides, it was poſſible for him ſtill to act, though unſeen, as the ſhow-man behind the canvaſs gives movement and volubility to his puppets.<note n="*" place="bottom">If ſome good ſoul would but give us a peep into the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>patches that now and then go over to Long-iſland, we ſhould, perhaps, ſee ſome more "precious confeſſions."</note>
               </p>
               <p>Let it be recollected, too, that Genet was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placed by Robeſpierre and his crew, and I leave any one to determine whether the merciful Robeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pierre, the very prince of cut-throats, could diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of the plans of our Long-iſlander. The gentle Roboſpierre did, indeed, ſend us word that it pained his humane and generous ſoul, to think that the repreſentative of a <hi>great</hi> and <hi>brave</hi> nation
<pb n="234" facs="unknown:030223_0065_0FE52B1DCFE10488"/>
ſhould ſo diſobey its will; but we ſhould have aſk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed this bloody villain, what he would have ſaid if Genet had ſucceeded in his <q>appeal from the Preſident to the people.</q> Genet was diſplaced becauſe he had failed, and not becauſe he had at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempted our deſtruction. Robeſpierre has been aptly termed the <hi>ſcape-goat</hi> of the Convention, in France, and Genet may with equal aptneſs be termed their ſcape-goat in America.</p>
               <p>The inſurrection in the Weſtern Counties of Pennſylvania was undoubtedly a great evil, but much good has been derived from it. This inſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection was imputed to the machinations of Great Britain, and as people's ears were all open to every thing, however abſurd, that was advanced againſt that nation, it is not wonderful that many very well meaning men marched againſt the inſurgents with a full expectation of finding them under the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand of the Governor of Upper-Canada. This was ſinning againſt conviction certainly; but, what errors will not men plunge into, when blinded by prejudice and pricked on by revenge! moſt peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ware heartily aſhamed of having been the dupes of this trick, long before the appearance of Citizen Fauchet's intercepted letter; but that truly ineſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mable eſſay on bribery and corruption has placed the whole matter in a fair light, and, as the ſaying is, "clapped the ſaddle on the right horſe."</p>
               <p>Every man who ſeeks for truth and not for falſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood will regret, with me, that we are not in poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſion of the famous N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 2 and N<hi rend="sup">o</hi>. 6, mentioned in Citizen Fauchet's letter, and of the other diſpatches preceding that letter. Had we the peruſal of theſe precious pieces, we might enter into ſome detail not having them we muſt content ourſelves with
<pb n="235" facs="unknown:030223_0066_0FE52B35671A6040"/>
proceeding like mathematicians, from the known to the unknown.</p>
               <p>We know, that the ſame man, who was Secretary to the firſt Jacobin ſociety in this country, and who afterwards denied his report concerning the <q>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal from the Preſident to the people;</q> we know that this man is named, in the intercepted letter, amongſt the three or four who were balancing to decide on their party, when the overtures for money were made to the French miniſter.</p>
               <p>We know, that all the leaders in the inſurrection, as well as their partizans here, were then and are now the decided ſupporters of France in oppoſition to Great Britain. If we look back to the meetings of the inſurgent committees, we ſhall there find the names of two members of the preſent Houſe of Repreſentatives, and if we turn to the <hi>yeas</hi> and <hi>nays</hi> of that Houſe, we ſhall find them both voting againſt the Britiſh treaty, and oppoſing every mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of the Federal government.<note n="*" place="bottom">When I ſaid, in the firſt part of the <hi>Bone to Gnaw,</hi> that the enemies of Great Britain were invariably the enemies of the Federal Government, the good democrats affected to laugh at me: let them deny this now, if they can. I defy even their impudence to deny the fact.</note>
               </p>
               <p>We know, that poor Citizen Fauchet expreſſed his ſevere regret at the failure of the inſurrection; and ſurely we know, that when a man expreſſes his regret at the failure of an enterprize, it is certain he wiſhed it to ſucceed. After having juſtified the cauſe of the inſurgents, and whined out their diſcomfit, he ſays: <q>Thus will the government acquire ſtability, <hi>for one complete ceſſion at leaſt!</hi> Who knows what will be the limits <hi>of this tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph!</hi>
                     <pb n="236" facs="unknown:030223_0067_0FE52B7E06373B78"/>
perhaps advantage will be taken of it to obtain ſome laws for <hi>ſtrengthening the government!</hi>
                  </q>— I was tempted to throw in an <hi>alas,</hi> or two here; nothing elſe is wanting to render the paſſage truly pathetic; as thus: <q>My dear Maſters, in ſpite of my teeth this government will <hi>laſt one ſeſſion longer at leaſt! Alas!</hi> who knows what may be the limits of this triumph over our brothers! Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, Oh hell! we ſhall never be able to knock it down.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Let the reader well remember, that theſe dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful forebodings of Citizen Fauchet are to be found in a confidential diſpatch, intended for the peruſal of the Convention only. It is from documents like this, and not from public declarations, that we are to judge of the diſpoſitions of a foreign go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment. Suppoſe, for inſtance, a letter from the Britiſh Miniſter had been intercepted, contain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing expreſſions of his regret at the ſucceſs of the government in quelling the inſurrection, and juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying the conduct of the inſurgents. What would then have been ſeen? need I aſk this? Poor man! the Lord have mercy upon him, if he had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mained here after the diſcovery. Our language is copious, and particularly in terms of execration; but I am miſtaken if enough would have been found. Thoſe who talk high-dutch would have had an advantage, as it is ſaid, a man can curſe harder in that language than in any other.</p>
               <p>Fauchet was recalled, and, as no miſconduct was imputed to him, he went home you ſee. But here is one circumſtance that I muſt beg the good reader to attend to, and that is, that Citizen Joſeph was
<pb n="237" facs="unknown:030223_0068_0FE52BB29CFD95C8"/>
called away <hi>after a defeat,</hi> juſt as his renowned pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſor was. As ſoon as it was known in France, that Father Joſeph's fatal diſpatch had fallen into the hands of the Engliſh Miniſtry, it was perceived that the writer would become odious here; that he would always be ſuſpected by the government, and that his friends would be afraid to truſt their <hi>pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious confeſſions</hi> to his ear. How kind was it, then, to recall him and ſend another, whom no mortal man could ever think of ſuſpecting: no, certainly not; it would be hard, indeed, to ſuſpect a third. The moſt unfortunate gamblers reckon with confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence upon a good throw out of three.<note n="*" place="bottom">Having ſtumbled upon the word <hi>Gamblers,</hi> it puts me in mind of the <hi>Farro Banks, Gaming-Tables</hi> and <hi>Gambling Lotteries,</hi> in all about two hundred now in this city. Theſe noble inſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions we owe entirely to the French; and, when we add to theſe the paganiſh calendar and the Age of Reaſon, muſt we not bluſh to think that theſe generous enlightners of the world are ſtill obliged to cry out on our <hi>ingratitude!</hi> how much better are all thoſe pretty things than the naſty broad-cloths and linens we get from thoſe ſad dogs the Britiſh!—And yet we make a treaty with them! O, fy!</note>
               </p>
               <p>The third (and I hope the laſt) fair trial of the ſtrength of French influence was, the attempt to ſet aſide the Britiſh Treaty. Here it failed alſo; but we are not to conclude that, becauſe it failed, it never was made. For my part, I am confident the trial was made, and have not the leaſt doubt that it would have ſucceeded, had it not been for a <hi>diſappointment.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It would be uſeleſs to repeat here what has been ſo often ſaid reſpecting the conduct of poor Mr. Randolph, at the time of the ratification, or to go over all the manoeuvres of the partizans of France, from the moment the treaty firſt arrived in the country till the meeting of Congreſs. Still leſs ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary
<pb n="238" facs="unknown:030223_0069_0FE52B7C722E5FE0"/>
is it to enter into a detailed account of what has paſſed ſince that time, as it is freſh in every one's memory. One fact, however, I muſt relate here, as it is well worthy of attention.</p>
               <p>In the <hi>Cenſor</hi> for April, page 145, it was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked, that <q>the petition againſt the treaty, ſaid to be ſigned by fifteen hundred citizens of Philadelphia, was carried round for ſignature by a <hi>Frenchman;</hi>
                  </q> to this I have now to add, that, in the State of New Jerſey, two <hi>Frenchmen</hi> went about ſoliciting ſignatures of another petition of the ſame import. The perſon, who was ſo obliging as to furniſh this information, ſaw them at a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic houſe preſſing people to ſign. He was himſelf prevailed on to do ſo; but, thinking, upon recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lection, that he had done wrong, he returned to the houſe and ſcratched out his name. Would to God that numbers of his countrymen were as ready to correct their errors!</p>
               <p>After having given this ſhort ſketch of the hiſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of French influence down to the time when, as our Paris intelligence ſtates, it was to break out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to action, let us compare that intelligence with the ſituation of things on this ſide of the water. A few ſentences will ſuffice.</p>
               <p>The ſubſtance of the Paris intelligence is this: <q>that certain influential men in America had enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a negociation with the French government, the reſult of which was; France was to oblige the Executive of the United States to abandon the treaty with great Britain, by threatening it with a war in caſe of refuſal; but that this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, the writer believed to be laid aſide <hi>on the</hi> 14th <hi>of February.</hi>
                  </q> On the 24th of March, Mr.
<pb n="239" facs="unknown:030223_0070_0FE52BD444DC3F58"/>
Livingſton's motion paſſed by a majority of <hi>twenty five.</hi> This was only 38 days after France had given up the project. On the 28th of April, 35 days la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, this <hi>frightful majority</hi> changed into a <hi>minority,</hi> and the treaty paſſed very quietly. This was 63 days after France had given up the project. So that, it is poſſible that this might be known when the latter vote was taken, and not when the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer one was.</p>
               <p>I by no means pretend to ſay, that any unfavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able news from France had an influence on theſe votes; on the contrary, I am, alas! (as Citizen Fauchet ſays) too well convinced of the purity of the Oppoſition, to ſuppoſe that they, or any of them, could be the <hi>"influential men,"</hi> hinted at in the extract. No, no, God forbid I ſhould think any ſuch thing; mercy on us all! they, poor men, changed their votes becauſe their conſtituents chang<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their notes. It is theſe conſtituents who are to blame then, and, of courſe, the <hi>"influential men"</hi> are to be found among them. Now, conſtituents are every body, and every body is nobody; and thus you ſee, reader, we all of us draw ourſelves decently out of the ſcrape.</p>
