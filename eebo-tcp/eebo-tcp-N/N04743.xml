            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <salute>Chriſtian Reader,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>INASMUCH as the Reverend <hi>Theophilus Pickering</hi> has publiſhed and recommended to the ſerious Conſideration of his Readers, a Narrative of the Ordination of the Reverend <hi>John Cleaveland,</hi> over a new-gathered Church in <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> conſiſting chiefly of aggrieved Brethren, heretofore Members of his Church, without exhibiting what paſs'd previous to this Event; it appears neceſſary in order to a right Judgment, that this Defect in his Hiſtory be ſupply'd: Hereupon we believe the Judicious and Impartial will not think quite ſo ill of us as Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> would have them; and all will be better able to judge of the Effect, when they know the Cauſe that produced it; and hereby it will alſo appear who are moſt to blame, Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> and Adhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, who ſo evilly entreated us for ſo many Years together, or we who by this Treatment were drove to this Paſs. It will alſo appear by this Narrative what Churches beſt anſwered the Chriſtian Character, thoſe that ſat ſtill the Spectators of our Diviſions and Diſtreſſes, or thoſe that appeared for our Relief in the Manner by him complained of.</p>
            <p>But before we proceed to the Relation of Facts, we would premiſe a few Things, and offer them to the Conſideration of the Reader.</p>
            <list>
               <item>1. As all Covenants, ſo Church-Covenants, ſuppoſe two Parties, each of which have ſomething to perform as a Condition dependant on each other.</item>
               <item>2. In Church-Covenants, the Privileges and Advantages, as the Word, Sacraments, Diſcipline &amp;c. agreable to the Goſpel, are always preſuppoſed, and to be regarded as the Inducements with the Perſon that joins with a Church; who therefore puts himſelf under their Watch and Government; which they promiſe and engage: But if this be neglected by the Church, then that Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant is by them vertually diſſolved, and the Party injured, in Reaſon and Juſtice (if not in Form) at Liberty from his Obligation to that Church. Hence,</item>
               <item>3. In Caſe it ſo happen, thro' the Art and Subtilty of the Paſtor being him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf involved; or the implicit Obedience of a major Part of his Church, to his Dictates and Deſigns; or from what Cauſe ſoever; that the Way to a declared and formal Diſſolution of ſaid Covenant, or the Relation of a Member, diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed in his Expectations as aforeſaid, is blocked up, and his Diſmiſſion or Relief not to be obtained in a Way of Order. Then, we ſay in ſuch a Caſe, it is lawful, at leaſt excuſable; to be ſure, not anſwerable to the firſt Aggreſſor, for ſuch a diſappointed and injured Member, to ſeek Relief in a Way extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judicial,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005920_0003_10292AC5D99D4040"/>ſince the main Thing in Religion, <hi>viz.</hi> The Edification of the Perſon can't be obtained otherwiſe. And to this all Forms however uſeful, muſt tive Way; and hence whatever Injury is thereby done to the Order of the Churches, muſt in Juſtice and Equity fall on thoſe that were the Aggreſſors, and had de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy'd the Thing in Effect: And for ſuch to plead a Right over Members ſo uſed and ſo relieved, or that talk of cenſuring Churches, who have afforded their Aſſiſtance; do by a juſt Conſtruction declare they have a Right to hold thoſe Members only for to abuſe them; and every Church that will be ſo hardy as to interrupt their Deſign, ſhall be ſure to ſmart for it.</item>
               <item>4. If this Neglect of a Church or Paſtor has been continued for ſuch a Length of Time, as in Reaſon to wear out the Patience and Spirits of the Sufferers, and produce an utter and total Deſpair of future Advantage by continuing together, and thereupon a Separation be produced (or may we not ſay <hi>extorted</hi>) then the Trial of the Caſe muſt be by what happened before this Event, and not by what the Church might afterwards do; which, whatever it is, might be done, only from politick Views, to bring an Odium upon a Tranſaction that they would not before uſe Means to prevent. And it appears unreaſonable to condemn one Man for acting incongruous to the Mind of another, when his Mind in that Matter was not known, 'till that Act was perpetrated.</item>
            </list>
            <p>Thus having premiſed or laid down theſe few Principles, we proceed to ſhew by a Relation of Facts, and by anſwering a few Queſtions, how far our Caſe correſponds with and may be ſupported by them.</p>
            <p>In the Year 1741 and onwards, it pleaſed God out of his infinitely rich free and fovereign Grace to bring upon the Minds of many in this Pariſh, a deep Concern about their future Eſtate, and <hi>what they ſhould do to be ſaved:</hi> And al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tho' ſomething of this Concern then ſpread itſelf over the Land, and in ſome Places was very remarkable, we believe it was in none more ſo than in this Place, where before we were as careleſs, worldly, and ſecure as any, if not more ſo. But now the Face of Things was changed: <hi>An Engagedneſs to hear the Word preached; Chriſtian Conferences; private Meetings for religious Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip; and Aſſiſtance to each other in a Way of Life;</hi> were what the Minds of many appeared to be deeply concerned in, and engroſs'd much of our Time: And we have undoubted Grounds to conclude (at this Time) the free Grace of God was richly diſplayed in the ſaving Converſion of many to God, among us: God's Grace be magnified therefor! At the firſt Appearance of theſe Things Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> ſeem'd very reſerv'd and cautious how he gave us Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; however, we had Hopes he would ſoon ſee it to be his Duty to fall in with what we were firmly perſwaded, was from the Spirit of Chriſt. But we preſently found our Miſtake, and that we were to expect little ſpecial Aſſiſtance or Encouragement from him: For, excepting that for two or three Months he allowed us to have occaſional Preaching from others under certain Reſtrictions; and that he would hold his own Lectures more frequently (which he drop'd again after one or two Sermons) we don't remember any Thing that he did to encourage or aſſiſt us; or that he adapted his Preaching any otherwiſe to the times (as we apprehend) than by taking Advantage of the Failings that attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, to blacken and diſparage the whole: Nor do we believe he will ſay, that he
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:005920_0004_10292AF8D9694790"/>once cloſely converſed with any one Perſon under Soul-Concern, when ſought unto for that Purpoſe; or that he once attended a private Meeting, whereby to aſſiſt and guide their Minds and Devotion in a Way of Truth; and to prevent thoſe Miſtakes in both he ſo often complained of: Nor will he ſay on the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary, that he forbore to treat both the Operations and the Subjects of them with a general Slight &amp; Contempt; once he ſaid, we were led by a deviliſh Spirit; which we apprehended was in a Manner unbecoming a Miniſter to treat any Thing that had but the Appearance of Religion; to be ſure in a Manner extream<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly offenſive and grievous to tender Minds.</p>
            <p>This Carriage, together with his <hi>old Way of Preaching</hi> (which now was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come very <hi>unſavoury</hi> to us) caus'd great Uneaſineſs. Some of us often apply'd to him for Redreſs, but in vain; for he ſoon refuſed to treat with us otherwiſe than by Writing; to which we were loth, knowing he had a Faculty to be critical; and thinking him diſpoſed to take the Advantage his Learning &amp; Parts gave him over us. But at length finding the Cauſe of our Offence increaſing, and <hi>no Hope</hi> of Relief, but by the Church, before which we ſuppoſed the Caſe in this Way would ſoon come; therefore on the 12th of <hi>March</hi> 1744, we exhibited a Paper to him, containing <hi>fourteen</hi> Articles of Grievance, reſpecting his <hi>Preaching</hi> and <hi>Practice,</hi> ſigned by twenty ſix of the Church, out of ſixty three, as we think the Number was: Hereupon we ſoon received his Anſwer in Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to ſome of the Articles of Charge, with a Deſire that we would explain our ſelves on the other: Whereupon we preſently explained thoſe he deſired, and as we tho't fully replied to what he had ſaid, in Anſwer to us; concluding with this Poſtſcript, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>Thus, <hi>Rev. Sir,</hi> we have examined your Anſwer to our Complaints, by which you will ſee how far you come ſhort in giving us Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; we pray you to conſider and duly weigh this our Reply, and our Complaints in this and our former Paper: And pray Sir, Do this with Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dor and a Chriſtian Spirit; and after ſome waiting we ſhall attend you in Perſon to know your Reſult: but ſhall expect a free Converſation, and no penning of Words, nor taking Advantage on either Side: If you are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced, and give us reaſonable Satisfaction, all will be well; otherwiſe we may then propoſe to you ſome other Method for obtaining Relief; for we propoſe not to follow you farther by way of Writing. <hi>April</hi> 10.1744.</q>
            </p>
            <p>To this we received his of <hi>April</hi> 16, in which was the following Paſſages, <hi>viz.</hi> 
               <q>You ſignify your Intention to come and know my Reſult (and have a free Converſation with me without penning of Words or taking Advantage) to this I ſay, if you mean to ſhew me Reſpect, I am much obliged to you; but I apprehend the Method you propoſe, is neither neceſſary nor ſafe.</q>
            </p>
            <p>This Denial (as we took it) of a free Conference, occaſion'd farther writing. The Relation of which we muſt at preſent leave, while we ſtep back, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late a new Matter of Offence that had ariſen, which we were controverting be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween us; the Thing was this, <hi>viz.</hi> On the 11th of <hi>March,</hi> the Day before our aforeſaid Articles of Charge were deliver'd; as Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> was preaching his afternoon Sermon, he had this Expreſſion, viz. <hi>That none know the Actings of Faith, but God only;</hi> or to that Purpoſe: After Sermon, one of the Hearers meekly deſired him to explain himſelf thereon, for that he was diſſatisfied with the Expreſſion; to this others joined alſo; but he declin'd anſwering the Queſtion, or explaining the Aſſertion, and declared, he was not afraid of <hi>diſobliging a
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:005920_0005_10292AC88D20BF90"/>Friend,</hi> or <hi>of loſing a Pariſh;</hi> as he remember'd his own Words; but as we underſtood him, his Words were, <hi>He did not value diſobliging a Friend, or loſing a Pariſh.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When we ſaw we could not then be reſolved, we propoſed to wait on him at his Houſe, for his Solution; and accordingly the next Day we waited on him for that Purpoſe; but it ſeem'd he had heard, his Words about loſing a Pariſh, were underſtood by ſome others as we took them; and that his Party did not like the Slight, they imported; hereupon, he at once refus'd to confer with us, on the ſaid Aſſertion, otherwiſe than by writing; and in a Mood not the moſt pleaſant, demanded of us, how he expreſs'd h0imſelf, the Day before with Reſpect to <hi>loſing a Pariſh?</hi> Three or four of us anſwered, we underſtood him to ſay, <hi>He did not value &amp;c.</hi> This Anſwer he immediately penned down, and then de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded, Who elſe dare ſay ſo? But others ſuſpecting his Deſign, held their Peace. Finding we were to expect Satisfaction in Nothing from him, we delivered him our Articles of Complaint before mentioned, and then withdrew: The ſame Day came forth from Mr. <hi>Pickering,</hi> the following Citation or Impeachment, in theſe Words, <hi>viz.</hi>

This <hi>Piece</hi> he ſent out by that ſame <hi>Titus,</hi> his Servant, whom he tells the Pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick in his <hi>bad Omen</hi> he ſent hither and thither, about the Time of the ſaid Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation; but as we could not think him in earneſt, or it he was, that we ſhould fail to prove the Point upon him; alſo in Regard he had quite ſlipt off from the main Thing, <hi>viz.</hi> our Diſſatisfaction at his Aſſertion in his Preaching, and his pretended Interruption thereon, and had laid out all his Concern upon ſome Diſadvantage be had given his temporal Intereſt; conſidering alſo the Severity of his Terms, we pay'd no Obedience to the Citation, nor gave Bonds of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnification, as was demanded.</p>
            <p>However, according to his Threatning, when the <hi>Court</hi> ſat, he laid the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter before the Grand-Jurors; but upon our producing a Number of Evidences to prove his Words to be as we had alledged; he ſaw good to drop that Matter: however that he might not fail to do us a Diſpleaſure, laid before the Grand-Jurors the Interruption conſiſting in our ſpeaking in the Meeting-Houſe as before related; and with two Days worry or Fatigue obtained of the Jury, to find a Bill againſt <hi>three</hi> of us, for aſking the Solution aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>At this Proceeding People grew more generally offended, which might be the Occaſion, that Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> cauſed the Church to meet on the 27th of <hi>April,</hi> about a Month after he had procured the preſentments, to acquaint them, as it appears by his Minutes, with the Difficulties that had ariſen; and ſeem'd to be diſpos'd to read the whole of our Papers to the Church; which we alſo earneſtly deſired, to accommodate Matters among our ſelves: but it ſtop'd in the Intimation, and nothing was done, excepting that he read the Paper of Charges, omitting what had been written thereon; he at the ſame Time ſaid much to juſtify his proſecuting us in the Law; however he told us, if we ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted a Senſe of our Miſconduct, he ſhould rejoyce at it, and endeavour to ſerve us at the Court then coming on: And to ſhew how far we were to depend upon his good Diſpoſition towards us, he then recall'd the Liberty he had given us of having the preaching of others amongſt us, which was the only Favour he had ever heretofore granted unto us; remarking at the ſame Time his giving that Liberty, was an Error in him, for which he aſked Forgiveneſs.</p>
            <p>Whereupon when we ſaw what his fair Pretence of a Pacification was like to come to, we delivered him a Paper of Complaints in eight Particulars, chiefly on his proſecuting us in the Law, and for refuſing to explain the aforeſaid Aſſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and another Paper containing an Anſwer to his of the 5th of <hi>April</hi> 1744. The firſt of theſe he read to the Church, and then diſſolv'd the Meeting with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Vote.</p>
            <p>Soon after this, our Trial come on, and we were acquited, paying Coſt. On <hi>May</hi> 7. 1744, we received Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi>'s Anſwer to our laſt mentioned Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per of Complaints, juſtifying the Matter of the Proſecution, but making ſome Confeſſion as to the Manner of his Proceeding: in this Paper alſo explain'd his ſaid Aſſertion, <hi>viz.</hi> That his Meaning was that none knew the Actings of Faith in another, but God himſelf. And if this was indeed his Meaning, he might in a few Words at firſt have told us ſo, and thereby prevented all the Miſchief and Offence that aroſe thereon, but he was not ſo diſpoſed.</p>
            <p>On <hi>May</hi> 18. 1744, we ſent him a Reply to his ſaid Anſwer, ſhewing that it was the Matter of the Proſecution, as well as the Manner of it, that was offen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:005920_0007_10292ACA1086CA08"/>and unjuſtiſiable: We alſo ſent him a ſhort Paper in Reply to one we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceiv'd from him, upon our other Articles of Complaint; in both which we ſtrongly urged him to call the Church together, and lay our Caſe before them, for their Judgment thereon. On the 30th of <hi>May</hi> following, we had another Paper from Mr. <hi>Pickering,</hi> inſiſting on his Juſtification, with a plain Denial to grant us a Church-meeting, for the Purpoſes aforeſaid.</p>
            <p>But to do Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> Juſtice, he offered on Sight of an atteſted Copy of the Bill of Coſt (from the Clerk of the Court) to repay us, if deſired; tho', as he ſaid, it was not agreable to Equity; but as our Concern chiefly was about his untender, and as we thought, unchriſtian Method of Proceeding with us, (which ſtill he laboured to juſtify) we let this go, with a great Deal more, it had coſt us, which he did not propoſe to repay, as a ſmall Thing, in Compariſon of other Things.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>May</hi> 28th we ſent him a Paper ſigned by thirty-five of the Church requeſting a Church meeting, to conſider of our Affairs: On the 29th we received a ſhort Paper from him, gloſſing on one or two of our former Papers, and denying us a Church-meeting, on Pretence we had left his Communion, which ſome of us had done upon his proſecuting us in the Law as aforeſaid (at which we believe the World will not wonder or judge us raſh in ſo doing; ſince 'till then under all our Abuſes and Neglects we had not left it:) he therein inſiſted we had no Right to expect the Church to act upon our Affairs.</p>
            <p>Thus unhappy were we; our Paſtor had for ſome Years treated us (as we apprehended) with Cruelty, and our Church with Neglect, whereby our Conſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciences were ſo offended as that, we could not in Charity and Love commune with them; and then this muſt be conſtrued as cutting our ſelves off from all Right to a Church-meeting for our Help! What could Men do in ſuch a Caſe?</p>
            <p>Notwithſtanding this Reaſon and Denial, or our requeſting again, a Church-meeting was held: All our Papers were read, but nothing was done thereon. At this Meeting we propoſed three Things to the Church, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>(1) Either that they would paſs their Judgment on our Cauſe, or let us know their Mind about it? or elſe.</item>
                  <item>(2) That they would join with us in Council. And if they would do neither of theſe,</item>
                  <item>(3) That they would diſmiſs us to ſome other Church, or to embody into Church-State by our ſelves.</item>
               </list>
But Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> did not ſeem diſpoſed, that the Church ſhould act on our Affairs at all, and by the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches accuſtomed Silence they were willing he ſhould have his Way; ſo the Meeting ended, and they did neither.</p>
            <p>On the 14th of <hi>September</hi> following we ſigned and ſent him another Requeſt for a Church-meeting; but on the 18th were deny'd in ſuch Terms and Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in Anſwer from him, as gave us to conclude he never would ſuffer the Church to act upon our Affairs; therefore on the 21ſt we ſubſcribed and ſent him the following Paper, <hi>viz.</hi>

                  <p>"WE find by your's of the 18th to our's of the 14th Inſtant, that you refuſe to call the Church together, to conſider and determine on the Charges we have exhibited againſt you, according to our Requeſt therein; and taking your Reaſons together, they ſeem to import thus much; That let thoſe
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:005920_0008_10292AFFB13A8A00"/>Charges be never ſo high and juſt; and the Church never ſo much rent with Diviſions; yea, tho' the Truthe of the Goſpel and your Uſefulneſs be in never ſo much Danger; and our Conſciences never ſo much offended; yet if you can ſurmiſe or imagine in your ſelf (being your own Judge) that our perſonal Conduct and Behaviour has been diſtaſteful to you; or that our De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires for Peace are not real; or if you can dwindle (the great Charges of not preaching the Doctrines of Grace as you ought; and other material Errors and Defects laid againſt you) into Trifles, as not ſeeing juſt as we do in the Times; or unleſs we return to your Miniſtry and Communion, without any Satisfaction; and the Cauſes of the temporary Withdrawment, don't only remain, but as we conceive, are greatly aggravated; that therefore we have no Right to deſire a Church-meeting; that you are not in Duty obliged to call one; and that the Church have nothing to do, or that they can do nothing with Safety in the Matter (and ſo you are ſafe.) The Abſurdity of this Way of Reaſoning, as alſo of your laſt Paper to our eight Charges, might eaſily be ſhewn: But we had done with diſputing before, for that beſides our having argued out the Matter before, and ſignified our Intention to proceed no further in that Way: We are, <hi>Rev. Sir,</hi> too well aware, how it would ſuit you, to run round this Matter in an endleſs Circle; you being in the mean Time ſafe; while we get no Relief to our offended Conſcien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces. Well, Sir, if the Church may not judge between us, and we can have no Deciſion there, we would propoſe this method, <hi>viz.</hi> That a joint Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil ſhould be called in, mutually and equally choſen between us, to hear and determine on the Matters of Offence, we have laid before you: And pray, <hi>Rev. Sir,</hi> you would call the Church together next Week, to ſee if they will join in ſuch a Council: We could enforce this Requeſt with Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations tender and awful, but let your Treatment of ſuch Conſiderations in our laſt, excuſe that we omitted them in this. We are, Sir, more than ever your aggrieved and offended Brethren."</p>

            <p>Here note, he would have us make out what we had againſt him, but would give us no Opportunity, either to himſelf by Conference, to the Church at a Meeting; or to a Council called for that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Upon this Defeat, we ſaw no Way left by the Rules of Order, but to bring on an Inquiry upon the Church, for neglecting the Means of Healing, agreable to the third Way of Communion; and being deſirous to try all Ways for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lief, agreable to the Conſtitution of theſe Churches; we accordingly applied to the Paſtor of the third Church in <hi>Ipſwich,</hi> to interpoſe in the Matter; and if he ſhould find needful, to come with his Church to admoniſh this Church for their Neglect &amp;c. The Paſtor ſome Time after made Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> a Viſit, and then renew'd it, with two other Paſtols in the Neighbourhood, but to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe: Some Time after the firſt mentioned Paſtor laid the Caſe before his Church, who voted a Letter to Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> &amp;c. Thereupon we had ſeveral Church-meetings, but no Vote muſt be paſſed; at one of which <hi>March</hi> 18th 1744, 5, the Aggrieved preferred another Requeſt for a Church-Meeting, to conſider and paſs upon their Affairs, before other Churches were concern'd, alledging that it could not be known what the true State of the Cauſe was; whether it was the Church, or only a minor Part that Really diſapproved of his Conduct, ſince to that Time no Vote of the Church had ever been paſſed about our Affairs: But at this Meeting there was no Vote paſs'd, nor any Thing done for us, nor was it thought that either Church or Paſtor intended to do any Thing; nay, Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> ſaid no Vote ſhould be paſs'd thereon by the Church, but what was agreable to his Mind; and the Church was willing it ſhould be ſo. Two Days after this, we received from the Paſtor a Sheet, chiefly filled with jealous Inſinuations and ſevere Reflections, on Occaſion of our Requeſt at the Meeting, but there was no direct Anſwer thereto: However, at the ſame Meeting, the Paſtor by a long Paper propoſed to join in Council, but on Terms ſo ſingular, that it is a pitty it's Length ſhould forbid it a Place in this Narrative. However, we will mention ſome Particulars. (2d) Article was, that fourteen Churches ſhould be called (at leaſt) to prevent the Multipli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of Councils. This might well be adapted to another End; when he had ſet all the Churches aſide; that he might do by the next Propoſal, which was (3d) that neither of us ſhould chuſe Churches, any of whoſe Paſtors have appeared by their Conduct to have eſpouſed a Party among us, or that hath pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judged either Side, or with whom we have had any perſonal Difference, or any Miſunderſtanding not yet iſſued or decided. (4) That it muſt appear that the Aggrieved were generally united in their Choice. (5) That the Choice made by each Party in Lanner aforeſaid, ſhould be refered to the ſtanding Part of the Church, for their Conſent and Approbation, to be ſignified by a Vote: ſo that his own Party was to chuſe all at laſt, in Effect. Taking this Offer into Conſideration, on the 15th we ſignified our Agreement thereto, with the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Amendments, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>(1) That the Number of Churches ſhould be fix, eight, or ten, inſtead of fourteen, or more.</item>
                  <item>(2) That there was too much
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:005920_0010_10292B029035C3D8"/>uncertainty in the Qualifications of the Churches; therefore we propoſed to try, whether we could not agree upon the Churches before we cloſed the Offer, or elſe that he would explain himſelf on that Head.</item>
                  <item>(3) That his Part of the Church ſhould determine our Choice, we could by no Means agree to: Theſe Amendments being delivered him, the fair Offer of a Council dropt, as we ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goſed it would, being unſnared.</item>
               </list>
By this it may appear what was deſigned, when he told his Church he was for healing Matters.</p>
            <p>But to proceed, on the 20th of the ſame Month, we received another Paper from our Paſtor, ſignifying that the Reaſon why we did not join in Council upon his ſaid Plan, was becauſe we were afraid of our Cauſe (indeed we might have Reaſon enough for Fear from the Nature of his Plan, without the leſt Regard to the Merits of our Cauſe.) But he ſaid nothing to our propoſed A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mendments; and makes another Offer ſtill more condeſcending in Shew, <hi>viz.</hi> That if we pleaſed we might call a Council our ſelves, but he thought it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaſonable to refer himſelf to them; tho' he ſhould pay a Deference to their Advice if they were not juſtly chargeable with Weakneſs or Partiality: But whereas this was no more than we might do without his Conſent, and to no Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, whatever their Judgment might have been; we regarded this Offer only as tantalizing of us, calculated by it's ſeeming Fairneſs to confirm the more fluctuating and conſcionable Part of his Adherents: Therefore we took no farther Notice of it. Hereupon, when the ſaid third Church of <hi>Ipſwich</hi> ſaw nothing was brought to paſs to Purpoſe, came <hi>Auguſt</hi> 1745, and blamed the Church for their Neglect; adviſed to join in Council, and ſo left us: Agreable to this Advice we proceeded to nominate ſome Churches, and eight were agreed upon: But before we proceeded any further, it was whiſpered about, that Things might be accommodated amongſt our ſelves by Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi>'s leaving us on certain Conditions: accordingly Committees were choſen on both Sides, to tranſact this Affair: The Conditions agreed upon were principally theſe, <hi>viz.</hi>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That the major Part ſhould conſent to his going.</item>
                  <item>2. That we ſhould buy his Eſtate.</item>
                  <item>3. That he and the Aggrieved ſhould forgive one another all perſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Offences, and part on peaceable Terms.</item>
               </list>
On theſe Conditions he would leave us the next <hi>March.</hi> Nothing could be more agreable to us: The Proſpect of Peace was ſo pleaſing, that without any Security from the Paſtor to perform his Part, we readily ſigned a Paper of his drawing up, whereby we freely for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give each other alſo, aſking pardon of God, declaring that all Controverſies, Offences, and Papers, relating to the ſame, ſhould be from thenceforth null and void. And that no Time might be loſt, the next Day a Paper drawn by him was delivered to two of the Church of his agreeing to, for to be carried about, to ſee whether a major Part of the People would ſign it; which was accordingly done; and a majority of the Church did ſign it; and then it was to be laid be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Pariſh: But e'er this was effected, it was reported, that the Paſtor did not ſign to go or leave the Place; and he being queſtioned thereon, the Reports were confirmed: It was for Reaſon alledged, that the Paper was longer in ſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than he expected; that People had been perſwaded into it; and to tell the Truth, that no ſuch Promiſe ſubſiſted, and that he had ſaid nothing, whereby they had Reaſon to think he intended it; or Words importing as much. It may, we think, eaſily be conceived how this muſt ſurprize us; and how our Relief in a Way of Order, (which we had for ſome Years been labouring after)

Our Controverſies hove up a general Forgiveneſs paſs'd, and nothing to ſhew under Hand, of the Promiſe that induced us to do this: (What can be thought of ſuch a Paſtor!) It is true, the Paſtor has ſince owned it in a Paper dated <hi>Febr.</hi> 7th 1745, 6. containing his Reaſons why he did not go: By this Means our Hands were ty'd, being turned out of the Way of Relief by Council, which taken together, with all we had met with, before; we might well conclude it impracticable ever to obtain any Relief in a Way of Order; he was ſo artful and ſhifting; we had endeavoured it, by applying to our Paſtor,—to the Church,—to him to join in Council, and by an Inquiry for three or four Years; and now ſaw our ſelves as far from Deliverance, as when we firſt began: However, we had this Advantage by the Pacification, that five out of ſix of our Number, that were (<hi>Auguſt</hi> 2. 1745) laid under Suſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by the Church for withdrawing from their Communion, for Cauſes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which they had then never ſignified their Minds, were releaſed from that Cenſure; whereby we had the Advantage of going off without that Incum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brance or Diſadvantage we ſhould otherwiſe have had, if a Cenſure be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſo, from a Paſtor and Church behaving as our's had done. Here, let it be noted, that this Suſpenſion was the firſt and only Vote that the Church ever to the Date thereof paſſed upon our Affairs, and this had no Reſpect to the Merits of the Controverſy: What Order of Diſcipline muſt this be! Sometime after this, when Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> and Church were, as we apprehended, about again to lay us under Cenſure, we went into the Meeting, and there declared, our withdrawing from them in Form: And this brings up the Matter to the End of this Affair; for our appearing afterwards before Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi>'s Council, was only in Token of our Reſpect to them, as Men and as Chriſtians, without the leaſt Thought of returning to our Paſtor or Church again, that we had left; or of diſſolving that Church-Covenant we had entred into for the Maintenance of the Doctrines Worſhip and Diſcipline of Chriſt in a Church-State by our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, in the Preſence of a Council of Churches conven'd for that Purpoſe.</p>
            <p>Theſe Things we think Mr. <hi>Pickering,</hi> ſhould have placed in the Front of his <hi>Bad Omen,</hi> if he had deſigned an impartial Judgment; for the Cauſe of the Cauſe, is the Cauſe of what is cauſed.</p>
            <p>Now from this Relation of Facts (if we have miſtaken or miſrepreſented any, we will retract as ſoon as convinced) the Caſe may be thus ſummed up: A Number of Church Members were offended with the Preaching and Practice of their Paſtor, and could get no Redreſs from him: They then agreable to their Duty and Privilege reſulting from their Church-State, laid their Caſe before the Church; they would do nothing for them, but by their total Negligence, and to ſay the beſt of it, paſſive Obedience to the Will and Dictates of their Paſtor, ſuffered their offended Brethren to be turned out of the Way of Relief, by any Rule known in our Conſtitution, thro' Length of Time; which muſt juſtly be ſuppoſed to be ſufficient to diſpirit and diſcourage any meer Man; yea, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce an utter unfitneſs for Church Communion and Fellowſhip together; and not only ſo, but by this total Negligence to perform this Covennat-Obligation to their Brethren, vertually and in Reaſon have diſſolved the Obligations on the aggrieved's Part towards them, ſo that hereby they have left themſelves not only without Excuſe for their Conduct, but alſo without Right to complain of any Thing that is done for them by others: Or more ſhortly thus; We put
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:005920_0012_10292B05534A2BE0"/>our ſelves under the Bonds of a Covenant with this Church, that we might en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joy the Priviledges of ſuch a State, which they then promiſed us; but thro' their Neglect or ill Conduct, we could not enjoy thoſe Priviledges, they kept not their Promiſe to us; ſo that of Courſe our Obligations to them, and their Right over us, muſt be vertually diſſolved, and we left at Liberty to provide for ourſelves as before we enter'd into that Covenant: And hence let us put this Queſtion; <hi>What could we have done more?</hi> Or what more in Reaſon could be expected to be done by us, all Circumſtances conſidered? Or which is an Omen of moſt Evil to theſe Churches, for a Paſtor and Church thus to treat their Members and to paſs with Indemnity? or for theſe Members ſo treated, to ſet up for themſelves, as we have done?</p>
            <p>If it be objected,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Object.</hi> 1. That the Articles of Complaint were immaterial and trifling: We anſwer,
<list>
                  <item>1. That they were, ſome of them, of the higheſt Importance in Religion, both <hi>doctrinal</hi> and <hi>practical;</hi> as not preaching the Doctrines of Grace; his not ſalling in with, and promoting the Operations of the Holy Spirit upon the Hearts of Men; but treating them and the Subjects of them unſeemly, and the like.</item>
                  <item>2. Our Paſtor himſelf acknowledged, they were of Importance, and the Church never pretended the contrary.</item>

            <p>To which we ſay, That we do not take the Argument to lie here: We took them to be real, and that was ſufficient. The Queſtion is not now, whether they were groundleſs or not; but whether (they being thought real by us) the Church ought not to have acted upon them; adviſed and admoniſhed the er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring Party: However, to humour the Objector; we Anſwer,
<list>
                  <item>1. That we did not ſubmit our Cauſe to the Council, and are ſorry that we muſt ſlatly deny Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> in that plain Fact. It is true, as we have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ready hinted, that at their Deſire, we (who always ſtood ready to give a Reaſon as well for our Conduct as for our Hope) did in ſome Meaſure acquaint them with our Conduct and the Reaſon thereof: But as they were a Council, we had no Hand in calling, and were (as we underſtood) only ſummoned in, to aſſiſt the Church in laying us under Cenſure; eſpecially, as we were before this em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bodyed into a Church-State and Covenant by our ſelves; we had not the leaſt Tho't of returning; and conſequently of ſubmitting our ſelves to that Council.</item>
                  <item>2. This Council did not condemn us in all our Articles of Complaint; but judged we had hard Uſage, and juſt Reaſon to complain in ſeveral; tho' it muſt be owned upon the whole, they turned the Scale in Favour of the Party that called them in; but this being agreable, as we think, to the general Cuſtom<note n="*" place="bottom">That it is agreable to the general Cuſtom &amp;c. to turn the Scale in Favour of the Party &amp;c. we ſuppoſe none will diſpute; and why muſt it be thought ſtrange, that this ſhould be the general Cuſtom of ſuch; ſince Parties in a Controverly generally chooſe ſuch Councellors as they think are of their own Sentiments, that will frame their Reſult accordingly.</note> of

                  <item>3. That as we underſtand five Paſtors out of nine did not vote the Reſult, and three of them with ſome of the Delegates openly proteſted againſt ſome main Parts of it, or at leaſt entred their Diſſent therefrom: So that we hope before we are rejected on the Score of this Council's condemning of us, it will beſhewn when a Party Council ever did otherwiſe than to Ballance the Account in Favour of thoſe that call'd them in. However, we verily think, upon the peruſal of the Reſult, we have full as much Credit given us as is uſual in ſuch Caſes, if not more. Nay, we believe that if ſome miſtaken and contradictory Conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions that are to be found therein were rectified and reconciled, the Iſſue would have been otherwiſe.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>But as we had nothing to do with the Council, or their Reſult, we ſhall diſmiſs it with this Remark, <hi>viz.</hi> That our being condemned by this Council, could not be ſuch an inſuperable Obſtacle in the Way of ordaining our Paſtor, as Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> would have it: And it ſeems Mr. <hi>Pickering</hi> foreſaw this, and therefore roundly tells the Publick, we ſubmitted our Cauſe to this Council, and therefore muſt be concluded by their Act.</p>

               <hi>Object.</hi> 3. Why did we not again move for Council, when he refuſed to go away, upon the Pacification, or proceed in the third Way of Communion, as before intended? To which we Anſwer,
<list>
                  <item>1. That we had been ſo often &amp; in ſo many Ways deſeated, we were quite diſcouraged; for out Paſtor always had Means at Hand, to turn us aſide from the main Point; and a Pretence to juſtify himſelf therein: Beſides his own Party ſeemed reſolved to protect him, let what would become of us. And further, by this Time we had ſuch a diſlike to his Miniſtry and Conduct, that we could not endure the Thought of continuing under them.</item>
                  <item>2. As to the third Way of Communion, it meets with no Encouragement in theſe Churches; we found by what we had done, that altho' our Paſtor would agree to call in Council to heal our Diviſions; yet in Caſe we were in ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt to proceed in the third Way of Communion; he would call a Council of Advice, thereby to prevent the Proceeding in the third Way; for by this Time, we both had found, that it was the ſettled Opinion of the Rev. Paſtor we had apply'd to, that in Caſe a Church in like Circumſtances doth call in the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cil of other Churches to adviſe about their Matters of Offence or Diviſion; the third Way of Communion ſtops of Courſe, and can take no Place; and we had no Doubt, but thoſe that for their own Safety had ſo often refuſed to call in a Council when they might be endangered thereby, would from the ſame Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple readily enough call in one when it was neceſſary for their Protection and Safety: Nor indeed do we know any Rule in our Conſtitution, for any ſmall Number to commence ſuch a Proceſs; nor can it be ſuppoſed, are well able to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005920_0014_10292B07602F1ED8"/>ſupport the Expence that ſuch a Proceeding muſt be attended withal. No, we conceive the Rule is for Churches in ſuch Caſes to come of their own Accord, and upon their own Expence; and if they do not, the Aggrieved are deprived of the Help intended them by the Conſtitution of theſe Churches: And were we now to be queſtioned by theſe Churches for leaving our Church and Paſtor as we did, might we not, in Anſwer, humbly and pertinently tell them, that the Church to which we belonged was rent with Diviſions, and thereby became Scandalous, and for ſeveral Years together neglected to uſe the Means of Heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, whereby we in particular, were greatly diſtreſſed; that all this was pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lickly known, and yet the Churches would not come for our Relief; therefore we were obliged to leave them as we did. On this Principle we think our Sepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration would have been excuſable, had we never moved in the third Way of Communion at all; how much more ſo, ſince we proceeded in that Way as long as there was any Thing to be expected from it, as before hath been ſhewn.</item>

<list>
                  <item>1. And who was the Cauſe, and how could we help it? unleſs we could have contentedly lived without the Ordinances of the Goſpel; and would not this have been a paying too great a Complement to Order? We truſt, Order is as beautiful in our Eyes, as in the Eyes of other Chriſtians; and that we have ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as much Pains to ſupport it, both before we ſeparated, and ſince; for this, let what we did for Relief in a Way of Order before related, and our preſent Church-State and Behaviour, witneſs.</item>
                  <item>2. As to encouraging Separations, and ſo endangering the Peace of the Chur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ches; we can truly ſay, that we diſlike Separations on trivial and ſlighty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, as much as any Chriſtians, and would with Humility caution againſt ſuch, or of taking Example by us, to ſeparate without weighty Reaſons: But where Chriſtians are treated by Churches and Paſtors, as we have been treated by ours, we have Freedom to ſay, that we have no great Concern about preſerving the outward Peace of ſuch Churches; and we think it highly offenſive to God if they do not ſeparate, ſince we can't ſee what Goſpel End can be ſerved, for Perſons to be held down under ſpiritual Tyranny, in order to ſupport &amp; main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain ſuch a Peace. <hi>Ye are bought with a Price; be ye not the Servants of Men.</hi>

                  <item>3. As to our having no Rule for our Proceeding, we Anſwer, If we have no particular Rule in the Platform, we have Preſidents both in the Word of God, and Church Hiſtory, to countenance the Thing.
<list>
                        <item>(1) As to the Word of God, we find, that it not only juſtifies us as to the Matter or Foundation-Cauſe of our Separation, as 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.1.-8. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 6.3,—5. 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 1. 2 <hi>Joh.</hi> 7,—11. 3 <hi>Joh.</hi> 7,—10. 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 3.6. <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.9. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.14,—<hi>uit. Jer.</hi> 23.16, 17.27,—32. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 13th &amp; 34th <hi>Chap. Rom.</hi> 16, 17, 18. But alſo as to the Manner of it, by the Practice both of the Prophets and Apoſtles, as Iſai. 8.11, 12. <hi>For the Lord ſpake thus to me with a ſtrong Hand, and inſtructed me that I ſhould not walk in the Way of this People, ſaying, Say ye not a Confederacy to them to whom this Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple ſhall ſay, a Confederacy; neither fear ye their Fear; nor be afraid, but ſanctify the Lord of Hoſts &amp;c.</hi> Jer. 15.19. <hi>Let them return unto you, but return thou not unto them</hi> Act. 19.9. <hi>When divers were hardned, and believed not, but ſpake Evil of that Way before the Multitude, he departed from them, and ſeparated the

                        <item>(2) As to Church-Hiſtory we ſhall mention only the two great Examples, <hi>viz.</hi> the reformed Churches ſeparating from the romiſh Church; and the Diſſenters from the eſtab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſhed Church of <hi>England;</hi> the Lawfulneſs of which has been ſufficiently de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended againſt all Oppoſers. And altho' we have not equal Reaſon upon all Accounts with the former, yet we verily think we have with the latter, for what we have done: But whether we have equal Reaſon with either, yet if we have ſufficient Grounds to leave the Church we belonged to; as in Conſcience we think we had, and hope we have made ſufficiently evident; we may juſtly plead theſe Examples for our Juſtification, and be ſafe, while they are unmoved.</item>

            <p>
               <hi>Honoured and dearly beloved in our</hi> LORD JESUS: We aſk of you as tender, charitable and compaſſionate a Regard, under our Circumſtances, as our Cauſe will bear: True it is, that in this our Time of Trial and Temptation, we in many Things may have offended both GOD and Man, for which we deſire hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to aſk both his and your Pardon; and in particular we do this of our late Paſtor and adhering Brethren, for any undue Warmth &amp; Raſhneſs in Speech or Behaviour, while our Controverſy was depending: However, we believe we can truly ſay in the Fear of God, that it has been our ſincere and main Deſire and Endeavour to promote the Intereſt of true and vital Religion; that the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel might be preached to us with Clearneſs Power and Succeſs; that Sinners might be converted, and Saints edified to Life eternal; and we truſt by ſtill pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuing theſe Things in a Way of Goſpel Order, Peace &amp; Charity, to recommend ourſelves to you, and reflect Glory upon the Author of our Salvation; who alone can finiſh the ſame in us.</p>
            <p>But if after all, any are reſolved to ſtir up themſelves, and endeavour to hurt and diſturb us in what they may; the Will of the Lord be done! We can only ſay under ſuch Apprehenſions, as <hi>Luther</hi> did, when he had done ſpeaking before the Emperor and States of Germany, in the Maintenance of the ſame Proteſtant Cauſes, "I have ſaid, and the Lord be merciful to me." Yea! one Thing more would we leave for the Conſideration of ſuch, which we have upon Divine Record, Pro. 17.15. <hi>He that juſtifieth the Wicked, and he that condemneth the Juſt, even they both are Abomination to the Lord.</hi>
