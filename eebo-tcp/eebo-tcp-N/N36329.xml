            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>TO inculcate the principles of virtue and morality, in the young and riſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing generation, is, no doubt, an object of the greateſt importance: and to effect this purpoſe, is the chief inducement with the compiler of this ſmall volume, for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>truding it on the public.</p>
            <p>From the compilation of a youth, peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple arrived at maturity can expect <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

            <p>Should this be the caſe a which from the opinion of ſeveral judicious friends, to whom he has ſubmitted the manuſcript, it will, it may prove as an incitement to his proceeding in ſome other undertaking, which, as he advances further in life, he truſts, may prove more conducive to public utility: to promote which, he knows to be the duty of every good cit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>izen.</p>

            <head>ON DEVOTION.</head>
            <p>DEVOTION, conſidered ſimply in itſelf, is an intercourſe betwixt God and us; betwixt the Supreme, ſelf-exiſtent, inconceivable Spirit, which formed and preſerves the univerſe; and that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular ſpirit, with which, for awful reaſons, he has animated a portion of matter upon earth that we call man. It is a ſilent act in which the ſoul di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſts itſelf of outward things, flies into heaven, and pours forth all its wants, wiſhes, hopes, fears, guilt or pleaſures, into the boſom of an Almighty Friend. Though this devotion, in its firſt ſtages, may be a weariſome and inſipid exerciſe; yet this ariſes mere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly from the depravity of nature and our paſſions. A little habit will overcome the reluctance when you have fairly entered upon your journey; the ways of this wiſdom will be ways of pleaſantneſs, and all its paths peace. True devotion, doubtleſs requires a conſiderable degree of abſtraction from the world: hence modern chriſtians treat it as a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion; hence many modern writers have little of its
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:047474_0005_1023B1A2581D4B48"/>
unction; but it glows in the ſcriptures, it warms us in the fathers, it burned in an Auſtin, and in ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny others of the perſecuted martyrs who are now with God. That we have little of it, is not won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful; it makes no noiſe in the circle of the learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, or of the elegant under a heap of worldly cares: we ſmother the lovely infant and will not let it breathe.</p>
            <p>Vanity, ambition, pleaſure, avarice, quench the celeſtial fire: and theſe, alas, are too much the gods of mortals ever ſince the world began! Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have been amuſing us only with ſhadows of this piety, inſtead of giving us its ſoul and ſubſtance. Superſtition has placed it in opinion, ceremonies, auſterities, pilgrimages, perſecutions, an auguſt temple or ſplendid imagery, which has little con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with ſentiment or ſpirit. Enthuſiaſm has ſwelled with unnatural conceptions, and obtruded a ſpurious offspring upon the world inſtead of the engaging child of reaſon and truth; whilſt the luke<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warm and indifferent, have reſted in a few outward duties which have had no vigor: and as they ſpring not from the heart, never entered the temple of the Moſt High.</p>
            <p>Real piety is of a very different, and of a much more animated nature; it looks up to God, ſees, hears, and feels him in every event, in every vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſſitude, in all places, in all ſeaſons and upon all occaſions; it is theory vivified by experience, it is faith ſubſtantiated by mental enjoyment; it is heaven tranſplanted in the human boſom; it is the radiance of the Divinity, warming and encircling man; it is a ſpiritual ſenſe gratfiied by ſpiritual ſenſations: without this, all ceremonies are inefficacious; books, prayers, ſacraments and meditations, are but a bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy without a ſoul, or a ſtatue without animation.
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:047474_0006_1023B1668E312DC0"/>
That man is capable of having ſuch an intercourſe with his Maker, there are many living witneſſes to prove, without having recourſe to the viſions of fanatics, or the dreams of enthuſiaſts. It may be proved to ſpring from natural and philoſophical cauſes; God is a ſpirit, ſo is the mind. Bodies can have intercourſe, ſo can ſouls: when minds are in an aſſimulating ſtate of purity, they are in union with their Maker. This was the bliſs of Paradiſe; ſin interrupted, and holineſs muſt reſtore it to a ſoul thus diſpoſed. The Creator communicates himſelf in a manner which is as inſenſible to the natural eye, as the falling of the dews; but not leſs refreſhing to its ſecret powers, than that is to vegetation. The primitive ſaints are deſcribing this when they ſpeak of their tranſports. David felt it when he longed for God. <hi>As the hart panteth after the water-brooks.</hi> Paul, when he gloried in his tribulations, it was embodied in him when he was carried up into the Third heaven and heard <hi>things impoſſible to be utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.</hi> Stephen was filled with it, when he ſaw the <hi>Heavens opened, and prayed for his murderers.</hi> By it, martyrs were ſupported when they were ſtoned and ſawed aſunder: and till we feel it in ourſelves, we ſhall never fully know how gracious the Lord is. If you can acquire this ſpiritual abſtraction, you will at once have made your fortune for eternity; it will be of little moment what is your lot on earth, or what the diſtinguiſhing viciſſitudes of your life; proſperity or adverſity, health or ſickneſs, honor or diſgrace; a cottage or a crown will all be ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny inſtruments of glory: the whole creation will become a temple; every event and every object lead your mind to God. And in his greatneſs and perfection you will inſenſibly loſe the littleneſs, the glare and tinſel of all human things. If I wiſh on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:047474_0007_1023B1A4B543D570"/>
to ſet off your perſons to the greateſt advantage, I would recommend this true ſublime religion; it gives a pleaſing ſerenity to the countenance, and a chearfulneſs to the ſpirits, beyond the reach of art or the power of affectation. It communicates a real tranſport to the mind, which diſſipation mimicks for a moment, a ſweetneſs to the diſpoſition and luſtre to the manners, which all the airs of modern polite<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſtudy but in vain.</p>

            <p>I PLANTED it with my own hand, ſaid my lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle ſiſter, holding up a withered China-aſter, plucked up by the roots.—I covered it from the ſun, I watered it night and morning; and after all (wiping her eyes with the corner of her frock) af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter all it is dead!—" Alas! how many are the occurrences in life, thought I, which reſemble Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry's flower.—Too eaſily believing what we wiſh, we adopt ſome pretty trifle; and laying it as it were in our boſom, love it "as a daughter." Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy paints it in gay colors; increaſing in beauty, we ſee its little leaves expand, and trace its progreſs with anxious ſolicitude, from the ſwelling bud to the full blown; and then when we fondly expect to enjoy it, reality tells us after all it is dead!—</p>
            <p>How often does an only ſon engroſs all the care of his parents, and wind himſelf round every fibre of their hearts. To cheriſh the idol, is every wiſh on the ſtretch, to indulge it are all the rarities of art and nature procured. Sleepleſs nights and anx<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ious days, are their lot: and lo! when they hope

to ſee the end of their labors, ſtruck by the hand of diſeaſe, or debaſed by the contaminating touch of vice, the agonizing parents find, after all, it is dead!—</p>

            <p>A POOR half-witted man, named Joſeph, whoſe employ was to go on errands, and carry par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cels, paſſing through London ſtreets one day, heard pſalm-ſinging in a place of worſhip; he went into it, having a large parcel of yarn hanging over his ſhoulders: it was Dr. Calamy's meeting-houſe, St. Mary's, Aldermanbury.

ſurrounded the Doctor. He read the text in 1ſt Tim. I. 15. "This is a faithful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt Jeſus came into the world to ſave ſinners, of whom I am chief." From this he preached in the cleareſt and ſimpleſt manner, the ancient apoſtolic goſpel, the contents of this faithful ſaying, <hi>viz.</hi> that there is ſalvation for the vileſt ſinners, ſolely through the worthineſs of Jeſus Chriſt, the God who made all things. "Not many rich, not many noble, are called by this doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine (ſaith the apoſtle) but God hath choſen the weak things of this world to confound the things that are mighty." While the elegant aſſembly liſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſly heard this doctrine, and if they were ſtruck with any thing at all, it was only with ſome brilliant expreſſion or well turned period that dropped from the Doctor. Joſeph, in rags, gazing with aſton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhment, never took his eyes from the preacher, but drank in with eagerneſs all he ſaid: and trudging homeward, was heard thus muttering to himſelf; "Jeſus Chriſt, the God who made all things, came into the world to ſave ſinners, like Joſeph; and this is true; and it is a "faithful ſaying." Not long after this, Joſeph was ſeized with a fever and was dangerouſly ill. As he toſſed upon his bed, his conſtant language was, "Joſeph is the chief of ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners; but Jeſus Chriſt came into the world to ſave ſinners, and Joſeph loves him for this." His neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors who came to ſee <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Have you cloſed with Chriſt, by acting faith upon him? "Ah! no (ſays he) Joſeph can act nothing; Joſeph has nothing to ſay for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf,

but juſt that he is chief of ſinners; yet ſeeing it is a faithful ſaying, that Jeſus, he who made all things, came into the world to ſave ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, why may not Joſeph, after all, be ſav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?" One man finding out where he heard this doctrine, on which he dwelt ſo uniformly, and with ſuch delight, went and aſked Doctor Calamy to come and viſit him. He came; but Joſeph was now very weak, and had not ſpoken for ſome time, and though told of the Doctor's arrival, he took no no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of him; but when the Doctor began to ſpeak to to him, as ſoon as he heard the ſound of his voice, he inſtantly ſprang up on his elbows, and ſeizing him by the hands, exclaimed as loud as he could, with his now feeble and trembling voice, "O Sir, you are the friend of the Lord Jeſus, who I heard ſpeak ſo well of him, and whom I love for what you ſaid of him. Joſeph is the chief of ſinners; but it is a faithful ſaying, that Jeſus Chriſt, the God who made all things, came into the world to ſave ſinners, and why not Joſeph? O pray to that Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus for me, pray that he may ſave me: tell him that Joſeph thinks he loves him, for coming into the world to ſave ſuch ſinners as Joſeph." The Doctor prayed. When he concluded, Joſeph thanke him more kindly: he then put his hand under the pillow and took out an old rag, in which were tied up five guineas; and putting it into the Doctor's hand, (which he had kept all <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

            <p>THERE is a remarkable paſſage in the life of Canute, king of England, containing inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions both to prince and people. His courtiers, (ever too prone to magnify and flatter thoſe whom they think to pleaſe by ſo doing) would frequently extol his power and wealth, and pretend ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times almoſt to adore his perſon. Canute was a man of too good underſtanding not to ſee the folly of ſuch flattery, and of the perſons from whom it came; but for their effectual conviction, and to ſhew the ſmall power of kings, he cauſed his roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al ſeat to be placed on the ſea-ſhore, while the tide was comming in; then, in the midſt of his flatter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing nobles and great lords, whom he cauſed to aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemble together for that purpoſe; arrayed in robes of gold with his crown on his head, and all the ſtate and royalty he could command, he thus ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſed the ſea. "Thou ſea, belongeſt to me, and the land whereon I ſit is mine, nor hath any one unpuniſhed reſiſted my commands; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Then riſing from his ſeat, and looking round him, he deſired all preſent to behold the weakneſs of human power, and that none truly deſerved the name of king, but him whoſe eternal laws both heaven, earth and ſeas obey. From that time he never wore a crown, eſteeming earthly royalty nothing elſe than poor contemptible vanity.</p>

If to accommodate man and beaſt, hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven and earth, if this be beyond me, it is not poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble.—What conſequence then follows? or can there be any other than this—If I ſeek an intereſt of my own detatched from that of others, I ſeek an intereſt which is chimerical, and can never have exiſtence.</p>
            <p>How then muſt I determine? have I no intereſt at all?—If I have not, I am a fool for ſtaying here: it is a ſmoky houſe, and the ſooner out of it the better.—But why no intereſt?

Is a ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cial intereſt, joined with others, ſuch an abſurdity as not to be admitted?—The bee, the bever, and the tribes of herding animals, are enow to convince me that the thing is at leaſt ſomewhere poſſible. How, then, am I aſſured that it is not equally true of man?—Admit it; and what follows? If ſo, then honour and juſtice are my intereſt; then the whole train of moral virtues are my intereſt; without ſome portion of which, not even thieves can maintain ſociety.</p>

            <head>THE HERMIT:—A FABLE.</head>
            <p>A CERTAIN Hermit had ſcooped his cave near the ſummit of a lofty mountain, from whence he had an opportunity of ſurveying a large extent both of ſea and land. He ſat one evening contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plating with pleaſure on the various objects that lay diffuſed before him. The woods were dreſſed in the brighteſt verdure; the thickets adorned with the gayeſt bloſſoms. The birds caroled beneath the branches; the lambs frolicked around the meads; the peaſant wiſtled beſide his team; and the ſhips driven by gentle gales, were returning ſafely into their proper harbours. In ſhort the arrival of ſpring had doubly enlivened the whole ſcene be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore his eye; and every object yielded a diſplay ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther of <hi>beauty</hi> or of <hi>happineſs.</hi>

            <p>On a ſudden aroſe a violent ſtorm. The winds muſtered all their fury, and whole foreſts of oak lay

ſcattered on the ground. Darkneſs inſtantly ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded; hail-ſtones and rain were poured forth in cataracts, and lightning and thunder added horror to the gloom.</p>
            <p>And now the ſea, piled up in mountains, bore aloft the largeſt veſſels, while the horrid uproar of its waves drowned the ſhrieks of the wretched mariners. When the whole tempeſt had exhauſted its fury, it was inſtantly followed by the ſhock of an earthquake.</p>
            <p>The poor inhabitants of a neighbouring village floked in crowds to our Hermit's cave; religiouſly hoping, that his well-known ſanctity would protect them in their diſtreſs. They were however, not a little ſurpriſed at the profound tranquility that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared in his countenance. "My friends," ſaid he, "be not diſmayed.
