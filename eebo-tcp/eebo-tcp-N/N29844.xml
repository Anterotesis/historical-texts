            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>IN the 27 <hi>v.</hi> of this Chapter, Our Lord Jeſus Exhorts his Hearers, that they <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour for the Meat which endureth to ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life.</hi> And there is a double Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive couched in the Exhortation.</p>
            <p n="1">(1.) That this Spiritual heavenly food of the Soul is unſpeakably deſirable; in that whereas bodily food, and all that the carnal heart can deſire, is periſhing, this is Everlaſting; and ſuch as feed on it, ſhall live for ever: Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare this 27 <hi>v.</hi> with <hi>v.</hi> 57. <hi>Labour not for the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:039688_0003_10157FEA399472B0"/>
Meat which periſheth, but for that Meat which en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dureth unto everlaſting life, which the Son of Man ſhall give unto you; for him hath God the Father ſealed. As the living Father hath ſent me, and I live by the Father; ſo he that eateth me, even he ſhall live by me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">(2.) That it is Undoubtedly attainable. <hi>Which the ſon of man ſhall give unto you; for him hath God the Father ſealed.</hi> There is not only all fulneſs of ſuitable and ſatisfying Proviſion ſtored up in Chriſt; but he has both Authority and a Diſpoſition to give it out unto hungry and humble Beggars at his Door.</p>
            <p>Now Chriſt having told them that they muſt labour for this Unperiſhing Meat, they enquire what Works they muſt do, <hi>v.</hi> 28. As the Young Man, Matth. 19.16. — <hi>Good Maſter, What good thing ſhall I do that I may have Eternal Life.</hi> They are careful about many good works; but Chriſt directs them to One, which includes all, <hi>v.</hi> 29. <hi>Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto them, This is the work of God, that ye believe on him whom he hath ſent.</hi> This is the <hi>One thing needful</hi>; for it receives Chriſt in all his Offices, with all his Benefits, that he may <hi>Of God be made unto us Wiſdom, Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Sanctification and Redemption:</hi> So that even <hi>the Righteouſneſs of the Law is fulfilled in them which are in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> by a lively, working Faith; Rom. 8.1, 4. And <hi>the Faith of Gods Elect does work by love, purifie the heart, crucifie the fleſh, overcome the world, quench the fiery darts of the wic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked one, give glory to God,</hi> and is the great Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the New Covenant.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:039688_0004_10157FEE0827AD50"/>But what is this Faith, ſo uſeful and efficaci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous?</p>
            <p>Why, it is nothing but what is expreſſed by the Souls coming to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, in the words of our Text, and thoſe that are next before it: <hi>And Jeſus ſaid unto them, I am the Bread of life: he that cometh to me ſhall never hunger; and he that believeth in me ſhall never thirst. But I ſaid unto you, that ye alſo have ſeen me and believed not. All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me; and him that cometh to me, I will in no wiſe caſt out.</hi> By the Contexture of which three ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and the three that follow next after, you may plainly perceive that Coming to Chriſt, and Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving on him, are the ſame thing: and as was ſaid before, the <hi>One thing</hi> — for there be but two things that we fear, Death and Want: now he that comes to Chriſt ſhall never die; and he that believes in him ſhall never Want; Chap. 11.26. Compar'd with this Context.</p>
            <p>And in the Text it ſelf, there is Double in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement offered unto the Periſhing Sinner, exactly Anſwering the two-fold impediment ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in the way of many Souls, when they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vited to come unto Chriſt.</p>
            <p>I am ſo weak and helpleſs, ſaith the Poor Soul, that I cannot move one half ſtep towards Chriſt, in the way of Believing.</p>
            <p>Now to Anſwer this Objection,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Chriſt,</hi> who <hi>died for us when,</hi> or becauſe <hi>we were without ſtrength,</hi> Rom. 5.6. does here put the diſcouraged Heart in mind of the all-con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quering efficacy that there is in the Spirits Draw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:039688_0005_10157FF05600F328"/>
who for this end is ſent out by the Father and the Son; even to make Chriſts intended Spouſe <hi>willing</hi> to come, <hi>in the day of his Power<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               </hi> All that the Father giveth me ſhall come to me. His <hi>other Sheep,</hi> that are not yet effectually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; they ſhall hear the voice of their Shepherd, for he will find them Ears, <hi>Joh.</hi> 5.25.10.16, they ſhall come unto, and follow him; yea run after him: for he will draw them by victorious Grace, <hi>Cant.</hi> 1.4. The Father, or the Elder Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther gives the little Child a hand, when it nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther can nor dares attempt to take one ſtep; and ſo it comes ſecurely, though with much fear and trembling, to their arms and boſom. <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But the awakned Sinner hath further to ſay;</p>
            <p>If I ſhould come to Chriſt, laden as I am with iniquity; guilty before God and Man of tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion and ſin; for number unaccountable; for heinouſneſs double died: beſides the curſed ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance and enmity ſtill remaining in my heart; that as I never have, ſo I never can do any thing but diſhonour God, and damn my own Soul: How can it ever enter into my heart, that ſuch a Rebel ſhall be received to Mercy; and ſuch crimſon and ſcarlet abominations be forgiven.</p>
            <p>Anſw. <hi>Him that comes to me, I will in no wiſe cast out.</hi> Whatſoever he has been or done, and left undone or ſet his heart upon; <hi>him that comes to me,</hi> let him be as bad as bad can be; and worſe than he can think himſelf to be: Yea worſe than ever came before him, or that ever refuſed to come; yet, <hi>him that comes to me, I will in no wiſe cast out.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:039688_0006_10157FF2C3883490"/>The Words need further Explication; but the <hi>Text,</hi> with little variation, will be the <hi>Doctrine</hi>; which to explain, confirm, and apply, is my whole buſineſs in the preſent Exerciſe; as it is yours to hear, receive, and improve what the LORD hath to ſay unto you, from the <hi>Text</hi> and <hi>Doctrine,</hi> which is,

to come to Chriſt, without Divine, almighty drawings: <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father which ſent me draw him</hi>—Joh. 6.44. But the ſight of their weakneſs is not enough to humble them: they are ready to make an Excuſe of that; they muſt therefore by a more thorough work of Conviction, be made ſenſible that they want a Will as well as Power to come to Chriſt; that they have a heart full of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion againſt the Authority of God, in every Command of the Law; but more eſpecially in [that Command of his] that Goſpel Command to periſhing-Sinners, 1 Joh. 3.23. <hi>And this is his Commandment, that we ſhould believe on the Name of his Son Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> They muſt have their Eyes op'ned to ſee alſo, the horrid nature of this Sin; what blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemy there is in the Diſobedience of Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>belief, 1 Joh. 5.10, 11. <hi>He that believeth not God, hath made him a liar, becauſe he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son.

He ſhall convince you of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, in and through me, for you; by this very argument, that I am received, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alted, rewarded according to the tenour of the Covenant of Redemption; as having done my work, which was to work out a Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs for you; which if I had not done, or done to the halves; I ſhould certainly have been ſent back again, and never have received my Wages 'till I had done my work. <hi>He ſhall convince the World of Sin, becauſe they believe not on me; Of Righteouſneſs, becauſe I go to the Father, and ye ſee me no more</hi>; and</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Of Judgment, becauſe the Prince of this World is Judged.</hi> This laſt Branch of the work of Conviction, implied in the Soul's coming to Chriſt, ſeems more dark than either of the former. How plain is it that <hi>the whole need not the Phyſician, but thoſe that are Sick</hi>: The Soul muſt ſee its Malady, before it will look out for a Remedy. Nor will a Sin-ſick Soul betake it ſelf to Chriſt for a Cure, 'till it be convinced that this Phyſician has the Balm that will Mollifie, caſe and heal its wounds: and if Guilt, for having violated the Law, be the Souls Wound; then a Righteouſneſs to Anſwer all the demands of the Law, muſt
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:039688_0014_1015800B93201288"/>
be the Guilty Conſciences true Relief; which Righteouſneſs is only in and from Chriſt. <hi>By him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which they could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes.</hi> So the Believing Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner comes to be accepted, as Righteous in Gods ſight. I ſay theſe things ſeem more plain: they are plain to him that has a Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Underſtanding. But what it is to be <hi>Convinced of Judgment, becauſe the Prince of this World is Judged,</hi> is not ſo obvious. So far as is neceſſary for my preſent purpoſe; that Conviction of Judgment which draws the Soul to Chriſt, I conceive, in part, to be thus wrought, and neceſſary to be wrought; <hi>viz.</hi> As Conviction of righteouſneſs relieves under a ſenſe of Guilt, ſo Conviction of Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under the killing ſenſe of Sins Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in the Soul. As if our Lord ſhould have ſaid; I will ſend the Comforter to Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply Redemption, by Convincing of Sin, in its condemning guilt and reigning Power; and then by ſhewing the Soul, not only its diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge from the Sentence of Condemnation, by the Imputation of my Surety-righteouſneſs; but alſo its deliverance from the Power of Sin and Satan, through my Conqueſt for it, in and by it. <hi>I will bring forth Judgment unto victory: the Prince of this World is Judged,</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demned, chained and dragged, as it were, in Triumph, at my Chariot Wheels, in my Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cenſion, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 68.18. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.15. And truly, to tell the throughly awakned Sinner of Pardon
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:039688_0015_1015800D9BCD2448"/>
without victory, could be no compleat ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction; being a Captive that muſt be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed by Power as well as Price. I acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge, ſaith the Soul that is convinced, not only of Sin, but in ſome meaſure, of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs too; I acknowledge that there is compleat Juſtification, thro' Chriſt, for the Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving Sinner: but as for me, I am an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent Unbeliever. My caſe and diſpoſition is expreſſed, Joh. 5.40. <hi>Ye will not come to me that ye might have Life.</hi> And I am likely to drop into Hell, before the Open Arms of a Merciful Redeemer, becauſe I cannot, or rather becauſe my will is not to run into thoſe Saving Arms. Then comes the Almighty Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit, and convinces of Judgment; ſhewing how that Chriſt hath bruiſed the old Serpents Head;
<q>by baniſhing him his Temples, ſilen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing him in his Oracles, diſpoſſeſſing him of Humane Bodies, terrifying him with the Unexpected approach of Hell, defeating his Temptations in the Wilderneſs, conquering him upon Mount Calvary, diſarming him at once of all his three great Weapons, the curſe of the Law, the ſtrength of Sin, and the Power of Death.</q>
So that he can de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Captiv'd Soul no longer: It is now made willing in the Day of Chriſts Power.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Coming to Chriſt implies or preſuppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeth a ſenſe of Self-emptineſs, as well as Guilti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; together with the inward and effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious as well as outward Doctrinal revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:039688_0016_10158011AAE30100"/>
of Chriſt, in his All fulneſs; not only of Righteouſneſs and Strength, but Grace and Good-will towards Men. This is repreſented in the Parable of the Prodigal, <hi>&amp;c. Luke</hi> 15. He was brought to extremity of pinching want: Nor could any ſuitable ſupply be had for his neceſſities, in all that forein Country, Only <hi>in his Fathers Houſe was bread</hi>; and there was <hi>enough and to ſpare.</hi> It was this double ſenſe that brought him to Reſolve; <hi>I will ariſe now and go to my Father,</hi> &amp;c. Inlarge in your Meditations on this Inſtructive, and Encouraging Example.</p>
               <p n="3">3. <hi>Coming to Christ implies a Diſpoſition in the coming Soul Anſwerable to the diſcoveries of Christ made unto the Soul: And ſo far as the Soul ſees and conſiders the Lord Jeſus, in his Nature, Offices, Properties and Operations; ſo far is this New Diſpoſition reduced into act or motion.</hi> Is <hi>Chriſt over all, God bleſſed for ever?</hi> Acts 9.5. Then ſaith the Soul, I will <hi>Worſhip Him,</hi> as I am required to do, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 45.11. Was he born of a Virgin, that he might purchaſe his Church with his blood, and be a ſuitable Head to it? And how is he, for the aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Wiſdom, Condeſcenſion and Love herein expreſſed, both admir'd and ador'd! Is he the Great Prophet, Prieſt and King of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? Then, ſaith the coming Soul, He ſhall be both my Atonement, and Advocate; and I will be his Diſciple, and Subject, to take his Yoke upon me, and learn of him. Is he the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:039688_0017_1015801422B5F898"/>
chief of ten Thouſands? He ſhall be altogether lovely in mine eyes. In a word, has it plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed the Father that in him all fulneſs ſhould dwell? I will then depend on him as my Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; and truſt in him to ſave me from my Sins, and deliver from the Wrath to come; becauſe his Name is Jeſus, a SAVIOUR; <hi>Matth.</hi> 1.21. 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 1.10.</p>
               <p n="2">2. Queſt. <hi>What ſecurity is there, with reſpect to thoſe that the Father hath given to our Lord Jeſus Christ; that they ſhall, all of them, come thus, unto him?</hi>

                  <hi>Anſw.</hi> There is full and ſuper-abundant Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity, as to this Infinite Concern; and it ſtands in ſuch things as theſe.</p>
               <p n="1">1. The immutability of the Counſel of God's Will, and purpoſes of his Grace; according to an inviolable Covenant of Redemption; Rom. 9.11. <hi>For the Children being not yet born, nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther having done any good or evil, that the Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of God according to Election might ſtand; not of works, but of him that calleth.</hi> Chap. 11.7. <hi>What then? Iſrael hath not obtained that which he ſeeketh for; but the Election hath obtained it, and the reſt were blinded.</hi> 2 Tim. 2.17, 18, 19. <hi>And their Word will eat as doth a canker: of whom is Hymeneus and Philetus; who concerning the Truth have erred, ſaying that the Reſurrection is paſt already; and overthrow the Faith of ſome.
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:039688_0018_1015801761604FC0"/>
Nevertheleſs, the Foundation of God standeth ſure, having this ſeal, The Lord kneweth them that are his.</hi> Heb. 6.17, 18. <hi>Wherein God willing more abundantly to ſhew unto the Heirs of Promiſe the Immutability of his Counſel, confirmed it by an Oath: That by two Immutable things, in which it was impoſſible for God to lie, we might have a strong Conſolation,</hi> —Pſal. 40.6—8.— <hi>Burnt-offering and Sin-offering hast thou not re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired. Then ſaid I, Lo, I come; in the Vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumn of the Book it is written of me: I delight to do thy will, O my God: Yea thy Law is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in my heart.</hi> Zech. 6.13. — <hi>And the Counſel of Peace ſhall be between them both</hi>; i. e. The Lord of Hoſts, and <hi>the Man whoſe Name is the</hi> BRANCH, <hi>v.</hi> 12. Two Infallible Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons; therefore the Salvation of the Elect, which was the Matter Undertaken, and made as ſure as theſe two Infinite Parties, by con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>triving, willing, declaring, promiſing, cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nanting, ſwearing, and even pledging their very Being, could make it; cannot poſſibly Fail.</p>
               <p n="2">2. This ſecurity further ſtands in the Divine Alſufficiency to bring to paſs what the Father and the Son have purpoſed, predicted, promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed, ingaged in, and reſolved to Effect. <hi>All that the Father giveth me, ſhall come to me,</hi> ſaith Chriſt: But what if they ſhould want both Power, and a Will to come? <hi>I will make them WILLING in the day of my Power. I will work to will and to do, in them, of my own good Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure,</hi> ſaith the Lord. <hi>I will lead the blind by a

way they have not known. The Dead ſhall hear the voice of the Son of God; and they that hear ſhall live. Every one that hath heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto me.— Who worketh all things after the counſel of his own will</hi>; Pſal. 110.3. Phil. 2.13. Iſai. 42.16. Joh. 5.25.6.44. Eph. 1.11. So that unleſs Infinite Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the Creating Reſurrection, and all conquering Power of the Almighty ſhould be Inſufficient to bring to paſs what He that can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not lie has promiſed, and ſworn to accompliſh<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> the Elect cannot fail, any one of them, of co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming into the Everlaſting Arms of their Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</p>
               <p n="3">3. To ſumm up what might have been fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Branched forth, into divers Heads of Anſwer. All proper Means, and ſuch as the Wiſdom of God, and the Power of God has made effectual to the Elect, in all former Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerations, and to many Thouſands in our Days; all thoſe Means, in great variety, are ready at hand, for the Enlightning, Convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing, Perſwading, and effectual Calling of the other Sheep, which are not yet brought in: nor can we ſuppoſe more difficult Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes than have been; ſuch as <hi>Menaſſeh, Magda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len,</hi> and <hi>Paul</hi>; the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> and Chriſt's Murderers: yet ſuppoſe, if you pleaſe, a Caſe more difficult than all theſe; yet will it be a like eaſy to Omnipotent Wiſdom: And all poſſible oppoſition from Earth and Hell; yea or Sin, which is more than both<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> all that Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nality
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:039688_0020_1015801C04F29A00"/>
of the Mind, and curſed Enmity of the Will; all that hardneſs of Heart, blindneſs of Mind, and ſearedneſs of Conſcience, that could ever be found in any Elect Soul; I ſay, all was fore-ſeen perfectly, when the Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Redemption was in making: What then hindred not from undertaking their Ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual Calling, can never be ſuppoſed to obſtruct the accompliſhing of it; being once, ſo ſolemnly ingaged for. In a word; If any one ſingle Perſon, that the Father has given to Chriſt, in the ſenſe of our Text, might fail of coming to him; then all might fail; and every thing elſe that he has purpoſed, or promiſed, or ſworn to Effect, Pſal. 89.35. <hi>Once have I ſworn by my Holineſs, that I will not lie unto David,</hi> i. e. unto Chriſt, his Seed, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Elect, ſhall endure; which implies their coming to Chriſt. Nor could the Bleſſed God be ſecure as to any thing that he ſhould pleaſe to ingage in; which is Blaſphemy, in a high degree to imagine.</p>
               <p>Thus much for the Firſt and Second Branch of the Text and Doctrine; by which you ſee, that of all the Father giveth to Jeſus Chriſt, not One ſhall fail of coming unto him. It remains, that we Explain and Confirm the third Propoſition.</p>

And I will give them one heart, and one way, that they may fear me for ever, — And I will make an Everlaſting Covenant with them, that I will not turn away from them, to do them good; but I will put my fear in their hearts, that they ſhall not depart from me.</hi> And Cautions are ſo far from inferring any poſſibility of an Elect Souls periſhing, or a true Believers lo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing his Faith; that they prove the quite Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary: Since God, who has ingaged for the Saints Perſeverance, has alſo provided all Means to ſecure it; among which theſe Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Warnings are not the leaſt. <hi>Paul</hi> once told a certain number of Men, in great hazzard of their Lives, that they ſhould be every Man of them Saved. He told them ſo in the Name of God; for he was aſſured of it by Revelation from Heaven. And yet, after all, Cautions, Directs and Warns them about the Means of their Preſervation; What they muſt do, and what they muſt avoid, in order to it, as the appointed Means: yea is Poſitive, that except the way of their ſafety be taken, and the way of their deſtruction
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:039688_0024_10158026F46AFDB8"/>
be avoided, they could not be ſafe; <hi>Acts</hi> 21. And if theſe things be conſiſtent in Temporal Caſes, why not in Spiritual? <hi>Becauſe I live,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>ye ſhall live alſo:</hi> Yet, <hi>If ye live after the fleſh, ye ſhall die,</hi> ſaith Paul.</p>
               <p>Thirdly; There is, at leaſt, one thing more implyed in the Words, I will in no wiſe caſt out; and that is the jealous Fear, part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly through ignorance, and partly through guilt, that is wont to fill and perplex the Minds of awakned Sinners, that are invited to accept of whole Salvation through Chriſt. For ſuch as we are, and have been, to come into a State of Peculiar Favour and Friendſhip with the Son of God, and Lord of Angels; <hi>Who is of purer eyes than to behold iniquity, and who cannot look upon Sin?</hi> We are afraid and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhamed to come. But have you not the more need of Pardon and Salvation through Chriſt? And ſince he calls you, it will be no pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumption to come when you are called<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but wicked rebellion to refuſe. <hi>Ariſe,</hi> ſaith Chriſt, <hi>and come away. Come unto me, all ye that labour and are heavy laden, and I will give you Rest. If any man thirſt, let him come to me and drink. I will give to him that is a-thirst, of the Fountain of the water of Life, freely, The Spirit and the Bride ſay, Come; and let him that heareth ſay, Come, and let him that is a-thirst come: And whoſoever will, let him take of the water of Life freely. Be of good chear ariſe he calleth thee.</hi> No; Others may do well
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:039688_0025_101580298C068978"/>
to go; but I am ſo vile and utterly unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy, that I dare not venture. Alas! All the venture lies in your Diſobedience to the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Call; for <hi>him that comes to</hi> Chriſt, <hi>He will in no wiſe caſt. out: But he that believes not ſhall be damned.</hi> Sinners are afraid to truſt in Chriſt, and not ſo much afraid to continue in Unbelief, Now what an unaccountably ſtrange thing is this! Afraid to go to Chriſt, when he Calls, Invites, Intreats and Commands the periſhing Soul to come: And at the ſame time, daring to ſtay away from Him, altho' he threatens with all the fiery Curſes in the Law, and Eternal damnation in the other World, every Soul that diſobeys the Goſpel, by refuſing to come to Chriſt. What ſhall we think of this Matter? Why, the Truth of the Matter is and muſt needs be this; That they Queſtion the Truth of the Goſpel. It can't poſſibly be otherwiſe; in that, when the Truth of the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> That there is Salvation in Chriſt for the chief of Sinners, on condition of Acceptance, when 'tis offer'd: this, I ſay, being once cleared up to any Soul; that Soul never objects its Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthineſs to come to Chriſt: Nor its want of Power to believe neither; for it is as Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural to Confide in and rely upon a known, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, bountiful, and faithful Promiſer, as it is to be jealous of a known Cheat. How well then did Jeſus ſay, Joh. 17.3. <hi>This is Life Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal, that they might KNOW thee the only true God, and Jeſus Chriſt whom thou haſt ſent?</hi>
                  <pb n="25" facs="unknown:039688_0026_1015802DC4C9A1B8"/>
They that <hi>Know</hi> the Lord, whoſe Name is <hi>Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful</hi> and <hi>True,</hi> will put their Truſt in him: and they that do not ſo, therein make him a Liar; as was ſhown before. And that you may know the Lord, and the workings of his Heart and Soul toward periſhing Sinners; let me a little argue the Truth of this laſt Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition, to make way for the Application of the whole; by ſhewing, in a few Particulars, how certain it is, that <hi>Chriſt will in no wiſe caſt out any One that cometh to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="1">1. In that he is not only as full as he can hold of Good Will towards Men, and every way furniſhed to Compleat their Salvation; but he is alſo many ways obliged to receive all that come unto him.</p>
               <p>For,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) <hi>This is his Fathers Will that ſent him, that every one who ſeeth the Son and believeth on him, may have Everlaſting Life.</hi> Joh. 17. 3. Now, he that drank off a Cup of Unmixed Wrath, which put him into a Bloody Sweat, and becauſe it was his Fathers Will; cannot, ſurely, caſt out any one that, <hi>having heard and learned of the Father, cometh unto him,</hi> as the Appointed and Anointed Saviour.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) He is Self-obliged, by his own free Promiſes, to receive all Comers, good and bad, in the ſenſe of that Text, Matth. 22.10. <hi>So thoſe Servants went out into the high-ways, and gathered together all, as many as they found, both
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:039688_0027_1015802FD5964E60"/>
bad and good: and the Wedding was furniſhed with gueſts.</hi> In the Invitations, Commands and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Chriſt, before-mentioned, there is no Exception, excluſive of any Comer.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) Yea, and his thus ſending forth his Servants, with ſuch Meſſages as they bring to hunger-ſtarv'd, naked Beggars, does lay ſome ingagement on the Bountiful Maſter of the Feaſt, to make them welcome, when they come at his Call, and do as they are bidden, Matth. 22.4. <hi>Again he ſent forth other Servants, ſaying, Tell them which are bidden, Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my Oxen, and my Fatlings are killed, and all things are ready: Come unto the Marriage.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now, before we paſs to another Argument, let us lay theſe Three things together: and can it once enter into our Thoughts, that the Dear and only Son of Gods Love will croſs his Father's Will; that Eternal Truth will break his Promiſe, and Infinite Goodneſs invite fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſhing Souls to a Feaſt, only to mock them?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Which might have been brought under the former Argument; Such as come to Chriſt, are the very Perſons that his Father gave him, in the Covenant of Redemption; and on whom he hath ſet his Unchangeable Love, in the days of Eternity; His Children, his Siſter and his Spouſe; for whom he did and ſuffered more than Son of Man, or Angels Tongue can, poſſibly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:039688_0028_1015803304DDF4D8"/>
and on whom he has waited, 'till <hi>his head was filled with dew, and his locks with the drops of the Night:</hi> And can he yet find in his heart to thruſt and kick them away out of his Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence, when they come; ſecretly too, drawn by his Spirit? It can never be!</p>
               <p n="3">3. How can that Meek and Merciful Jeſus, whoſe Bowels of Compaſſion ſo tenderly moved towards thoſe whoſe hearts were full of Mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der and Blaſphemy againſt him, that he be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moaned, and with many Tears, lamented over them, becauſe of their unrelenting obſtinacy in rejecting him, when he came unto them: How can he, I ſay, after this, caſt out, abhor and deſtroy ſuch as come, and fail down in the duſt at his feet? <hi>A Mother ſhall ſooner forget her ſucking Child, that ſhe ſhould not have compaſſion on the Son of her womb</hi>; Iſai. 49.1<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>. There may be ſuch a Monſter in Nature. But I will add, that the Tendereſt Mother, who can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not bear to ſee the leaſt Severity uſed towards an Enemy, or ev'n a dumb Creature; ſuch an one ſhall ſooner throw an only Son into the fire, and ſtamp on it with her feet, than Chriſt Jeſus will deny the moſt loving and hearty welcome to the Coming Soul. There is nothing in Nature ſo impoſſible, as that the Lord Jeſus ſhould caſt out the Coming Sinner.</p>
               <p>Finally; If Chriſt ſhould caſt out ſo much as one Soul that cometh unto him; No a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wak'ned Sinner, after that, could have any ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficient
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:039688_0029_10158037D24DDA20"/>
Incouragement, from the Goſpel, to be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve in the Lord Jeſus. For, does not ev'ry awakned Soul ſee it ſelf to be moſt unworthy? Is there ſuch another Wretch on the face of Gods Earth? Have any, but the Devils, ſuch Hearts as Mine? Now, if there were any Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ception, on the account of Unworthineſs; No thorowly awakned Sinner would ever come. All the hope and ſupport is, that the very worſt are not Excepted; and none were ever rejected, unleſs they refuſed to come.</p>
               <p>Beſides, if any Coming Soul, drawing near to Chriſt, meerly on the Incouragement of the General offer; <hi>Whoſoever will, let him take of the Water of Life freely.</hi> And this Large, all<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching Promiſe, that has drawn ſo many thouſands to Chriſt; <hi>Him that cometh to me I will in no wiſe cast out</hi>; I ſay, if any One Soul, from <hi>Adam</hi>'s Fall, to the laſt Trumpets ſounding, willing to Accept the offer, Coming at Chriſt's Call, ſhould be Refuſed; there were no more any Truth in the Goſpel, to be depended on.</p>

Father of Mercies to that Remnant; and ſet forth his eſteem of them! Eſpecially conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring,</p>
               <p n="1">(1.) That not ſo much as one of all the Millions of Fallen Angels was thus loved and cared for, <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.16. <hi>Jude, v.</hi> 6. Thoſe richer and ſiner veſſels were caſt away; and veſſels of clay, yea broken Pot-ſheards regarded, and gathered up; when a new World might have been made with leſs coſt; or this have been fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhed with new veſſels, made out of the duſt, as Adam; or out of nothing, as the Angels.</p>
               <p n="2">(2.) That theſe were by Nature no better than the reſt of Man-kind, who were over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>looked and paſſed by in God's Eternal Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe of Love; which He is ſaid to have <hi>Purpoſed in Himſelf,</hi> concerning the Salvation of this Remnant, Yea, do not many of the Elect prove much worſe than others, in Natural diſpoſition, and Unnatural Rebellion, before their Converſion? 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1. 26. <hi>Ezek.</hi> XVI. the whole Chapter. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6 9, 10, 11. <hi>Luke</hi> 6. 37. to the end of the Chapter.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.) If we conſider what it was that moved the bleſſed God, thus to diſpoſe of this Diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed Number; this further Commends the freeneſs of his rich Grace in Chriſt. He was not urged by Intreaties; for there was no Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture in Being to ſpeak a word for them, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.21—31. And the firſt made the Motion to our Redeemer.

<pb n="30" facs="unknown:039688_0031_1015803E98B85E80"/>
and the profit will be all their own: they were likely to be an Exerciſe to his Patience, all their Days in this World; by ſlighting his offered Grace, before their Converſion, and abuſing it afterwards. That, then, which moved the Lord to pity and ranſom a Number, was his Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious good Will, and meer Soveraign Pleaſure, which firſt Diſpoſed him to raiſe them from the Depth of Miſery to the Heigth of Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs; and then to commit them into a ſafe Hand, that the Deſigned Felicity might be ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured beyond Hazzard; that there might be no poſſibility of a Relapſe into a State of Sin and Miſery, which wou'd be Irreparable. And it might be further pondered, what Ingagements and Bonds the Father takes of Chriſt; and how high he bids by way of Recompence, — How he furniſheth him for the Work, promiſing to ſtand by him,— and every thing — be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond hope and deſire, beyond conception or imagination, of Men or Angels; — And all to Commend this Love to his Choſen.</p>

Hence, Nothing can be more abundantly ſecured, then their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat Salvation. This is what Chriſt has Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertaken; even to bring many Sons to Glory, and the thing is as good as done, when ſuch an Undertaker has Ingaged in it, There be ſome Men, ſo thorow in Buſineſs, that we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>con our ſelves ſecure, when we have com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted an Affair unto them, and they have

— There are ſome of you that believe not. For Jeſus knew from the beginning, who they were that believed not, — And he ſaid, therefore ſaid I unto you, that no man can come unto me, except it were given to him of my Father. From that time many of his Diſciples went back, and walked no more with him. Then ſaid Jeſus unto the Twelve, will ye alſo go away? Then Simon Peter Anſwered, Lord, to whom ſhall we go?

               <p n="1">1. For their Direction in the way to Chriſt; that in order to their finding acceptance with him, they fail not of coming aright unto him.</p>

The ſenſe of Guilt, binding the Sinner over to the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment Seat; Utter inſufficiency to obey, either the Law or Goſpel, together with the ſenſible acknowledgment of Unworthineſs to receive the leaſt Degree of ſparing Mercy, which is the loweſt kind of Mercy, has driven many a poor periſhing Soul to Chriſt; when ignorance of the Plague of their own hearts, has kept thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands and ten thouſands from him; who have been either always Sober, or of reformed Lives, and lively affections; living upon their own Righteouſneſs. <hi>I was a live without the Law once; but when the Commandment came, Sin revived and I died,</hi> Rom. 7.9.

You need not fear going to Chriſt too ſoon or too faſt, if it be to him, indeed, that you go: nor need you fear a Repulſe, or in the leaſt, doubt of an hearty and abundant Wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come, provided you come to him meerly on the incouragement given you in the Goſpel; which, in ſhort, is this, <hi>Christ Jeſus came in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the World to ſave Sinners: He is the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs to every one that Believeth</hi>; 1 Tim. 1.15. Rom. 10.4. If thou comeſt as a moſt forlorn, ſelf-undone, and as to what the whole Creation can poſſibly do for thee, an Hopeleſs Wretch, to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt as an Alſufficient and Compaſſionate Saviour; <hi>full of Grace and Truth</hi>; thou canſt not come amiſs, nor miſs of what you come for; <hi>viz.</hi> Sanctifying as well as Pardoning Grace; Worthineſs and Righteouſneſs, as well as Deliverance and Happineſs; even whole Salvation.</p>
               <p n="3">(3.)

If the Lord will Save my Soul alive, it ſhall live, for ever glorifying God in the higheſt; if not, I can but die, in miſſing the right Door of Mercy, after all my ſeeking and waiting; and Die I ſhall, moſt certainly, if I ſit ſtill. I will go to the King of Sion, in my rags and ſores, and plead Guilty, as well as Miſerable; and if I periſh, I periſh. And that you may not fail in this important Article, of Juſtifying the LORD and Condemning thy ſelf, how ever it ſhall pleaſe his Soveraign Majeſty to

deal with thee; Renew acts of Self-Reſigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, a thouſand times over.</p>
               <p>I conclude with certain Conſiderations, full of Incouragement to ſuch as are willing to be Directed in the Way to Chriſt; and reſolved, under the Spirits Conduct, to follow the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel given.</p>
               <p n="1">1. Before ever Man Sin'd or had a Being, the Saving of a Remnant, thro' Chriſt, was Propoſed, Agreed to, and Reſolved on, as what would bring Glory to God in the Higheſt, <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.3—12. <hi>Luke</hi> 2.14. So that by coming to Chriſt, the Believing Sinner falls in with the moſt Pleaſing Deſign that, for all what appears, ever came into the E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Mind: And can your coming off from the Creature, and coming out of your ſelves, and coming over to the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, then, be Unacceptable?</p>
               <p n="2">2. Chriſt Jeſus, your Surety, has already paid all your Debts, who are coming unto him; and has Received a Diſcharge for the greater as well as leſſer Sums, that were owing to Divine Juſtice; and you put the Lord to no difficulty; for he has, as it were, Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berleſs Blank-Pardons lying by him; 'tis but putting in your Name; which he will be In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely more ready to do, than you can be to give it up to him, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 32.5.86.5. <hi>Luk.</hi> 15.20; and on. <hi>Jer.</hi> 13.27. <hi>Rev.</hi> 22.17.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:039688_0042_101566335D342E58"/>3. Your very coming to Chriſt, and caſting all the Burden of Sin, and guilt, and fear, and ſhame Upon him, does more glorify God, than if you had never Sinned; or could, now anſwer the Law for your ſelves, in your own Perſons: and the more Guilt you are labouring under, the more Honour you put upon Chriſt, by believing his Righteouſneſs to be Reſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible, and his Blood Meritorious for ſo great a Sinner; <hi>Rom.</hi> 4.16—22.</p>
               <p>Finally; My Young Brethren, and Dearly Beloved; What ſhall I yet further offer, for your Incouragement in coming to Chriſt; that may, by the Bleſſing of Heaven, DraW you the faſter and the ſooner to him.</p>
               <p>Here you have it, on the Word of an Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal King; and he ſpeaks it on his Eternal Honour, That He <hi>will in no wiſe caſt out, the Soul that comes to him.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>You are, the moſt of you, I truſt, the Children of Praying, believing Parents; and ſo are under the Life giving Promiſe of Divine Teachings: <hi>No man can come to me, except the Father which hath ſent me Draw him:— It is written in the Prophets, and they ſhall be all Taught of God. Every man therefore that hath heard and hath learned of the Father cometh unto me.</hi> v. 44, &amp; 45 in the Chapter of our Text.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:039688_0043_10158061324CF7E8"/>You are found in the way wherein God is wont to meet with the Soul that ſeeks him, thus Early: and herein you are willing to ſuffer Reproach for Jeſus ſake; which is highly pleaſing to him, <hi>Prov.</hi> 8.17. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 4.14.</p>
               <p>Yea, is not the Good Spirit of God Now Striving with many of you? Such as are gone before you have had their Day: Some improved it, and are happy; others ſlip't it, and are loſt and Damn'd for ever. <hi>For, ye know, how that afterward when he would have inherited the Bleſſing, he was rejected: for he found no place of Repentance, tho' he ſought it carefully with tears.

            <p>WE do this day, in the Strength of CHRIST; humbly and heartily avouch the Lord, whoſe Name alone is JEHOVAH; Father, Son, and Spirit; to be Our GOD, and the GOD of our Seed; Entirely, and Ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſtingly Devoting, and Dedicating both our Selves, and Ours, unto His holy Fear, and Service, according to His Word; Promiſing and Covenanting to Walk with GOD, and One another, as GOD's Choſen People and a particular Church of CHRIST, ought to do: Complying with the whole Will of GOD, ſo far as He has been pleaſed, or ſhall further pleaſe to diſcover His Mind to us by His Spirit, Word, and Providence; Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledging, Embracing, and Submitting un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Lord JESUS CHRIST God-Man, as Head of the Church, Prophet, Prieſt, and King of out Souls; the Only Mediator between GOD, and Man, and

Surety of the New Covenant; that He may of GOD be made unto us Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption; Looking for Acceptance of our Perſons, and Services only in the Beloved.

And in all things labour to Carry it towards thoſe that are without, as well as towards thoſe that are within, as becometh the Goſpel of CHRIST; that ſo GOD may dwell among us, and be for us; and that we may be peculiar People to His Service, and Glory.</p>

NOW that we may Keep Covenant with our GOD, we deſire from the bottom of our Hearts, to deny all Self-Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, and Strength; and to depend Wholly, and Only on the Divine All-ſufficiency. And wherein, after our beſt Endeavours, we ſhall fail, and fall ſhort: We would Penitently, Believingly, and with ſincere renewed Purpoſes, be Waiting on Soveraign Grace, (through the Blood of the Covenant, and Interceſſion of our Advocate with the Father, JESUS CHRIST the Righteous) for Repeated Pardons to be Sealed unto us by the Holy Spirit of Promiſe. To which FATHER, SON, and HOLY GHOST, One GOD, the ſame in Subſtance, Equal in all Divine Perfections, Be Dominion and Fear, with Eternal Glory.
