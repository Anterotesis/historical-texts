            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">H</seg>AVING already addreſſed you upon the like Errand with our preſent one, we ſhall not make any long Apology at this Time, judging it need<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs; becauſe we truſt we have already given you ſome Proof of the Goodneſs and Honeſty of our Deſign, in ſpeaking our Part in this publick Manner, in the Defence of deſpiſed Truth and Order, againſt the Errors and Diſorders of the Times. It is enough (we ſuppoſe) to tell you, that we deſign to proſecute the ſame Cauſe at this Time: For tho' we are ſenſible, by late Experience, that we cannot eſcape the Laſh of virukent Tongues, if we ſpeak Truth without Diſguiſe, as formerly; yet we are in great hopes, that our ſpeaking the Truth without Palliation, will prevent our fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling under the ſeverer Stings of our own Conſciences; when Times appear ſuch, that the Lovers of Truth cannot be ſilent and innocent. We entirely agree with a Paragraph in a lace Writer, who ſaith, <q>That ſuch as are Friends to Liberty, will find it equally neceſſary to be Friends to the Principles of the Reformation: I am, <hi>ſaith he,</hi> always of Opinion, that Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtant Liberty and Proteſtant religious Truths are cloſely linked together, and together muſt ſtand or fall. The Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation can only ſubſiſt and flouriſh by the Principles it began upon: Every thing elſe, in ſome Shape or other, tends to Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery and Slavery. There is a falſe Policy in the World, an over-valued Learning and miſtaken Wiſdom: Nothing ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Conſiſtency will bear Examination. Truth only is great,
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004792_0003_100DED9438F41BD0"/>
and at one Time or other will prevail.</q> Upon this Score we are much ſurpriz'd at the Conduct of many diſſenting Proteſtants among us, who (tho' they ſeem'd lately zealous for Proteſtant Principle<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Can any ſuppoſe that the holy One, who once injoined divers bodily Purifications or Waſhings, in order to inſtruct Men in the ſpiritual Leſſon of Soul Purifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, in which his Soul delights, hath any where injoined Men to wallow in Dirt, in order to make their Souls clean?

to eſtabliſh Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s Character, and to propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gate the Credit of his Scheme, and alſo to palliate and defend his Errors: and Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> makes grateful Return to them <hi>in Specie;</hi> and this puts us in Mind of an old Story, which we read ſomewhere; How that <hi>Sanctius,</hi> the King of <hi>Arragon</hi>'s Brother, who marching againſt the <hi>Saracens,</hi> diverted himſelf a while at <hi>Rome:</hi> The bountiful Pope, who is always prodigal of what coſts him Nothing, cauſes him to be proclaimed, <hi>Sanctius,</hi> by the Grace of God, <hi>King of Egypt, &amp;c.</hi> The Noiſe of the Trumpets calls him to the Balcony, and he aſks, what was the Matter?

                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>aſh.</hi> How like this are the Proclamations made among us at Seaſons, we leave others to determine, only we ſhall take Notice, that it hath been obſerved. That when it is Mr. <hi>White<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>field</hi>'s Turn to ſpeak, then Mr. <hi>G. Tennent</hi> is proclaimed the <hi>moſt able and moſt eminent Servant of Chriſt, and all his Aſſociates or Party ſpiritual Men and faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, &amp;c. &amp;c.</hi> On the other Hand, if their Turn comes to ſpeak or write, then Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> is proclaimed the <hi>moſt able and moſt eminent Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant of Chriſt:</hi> Whereas, by his Writings he appears to be ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther weak or worſe; How elſe comes it to paſs, that theſe are ſo incoherent, empty, vain and trifling, and even fabulous in many Places, as we have partly ſhewn already? When there is ſuch an Hue and Cry after Phariſees, we would be glad to know, whether it would be ſafe for the other Side to trumpet one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's Praiſes ſo loudly and highly as this Side doth, without be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in Danger of being taken up for Phariſees, and having the <hi>Crow's Eggs</hi> caſt in their Teeth? Becauſe Chriſt ſaith to thoſe Phariſees that were offended at him for healing a Man on the Sabbath, <hi>How can ye believe, that receive Honour one of another? John</hi> v. 44. Beſides, is it not ſome Difficulty to underſtand, how <hi>two moſt Eminents</hi> can orderly ſubſiſt among <hi>Catholicks,</hi> unleſs One be content to reſide at <hi>Avignon,</hi> and leave <hi>Rome</hi> for the other? For, according to the old Rule, two Suns in the Firmament is one too many, becauſe ominous. It was remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, how highly Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> publickly did commend Mr. <hi>G. Tennent</hi>'s printed Sermon, preached at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> of the <hi>Danger of an Unconverted Miniſtry,</hi> as an excellent Piece, and as be judged, an unanſwerable one: This, together with the
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004792_0004_100DED96D21C7598"/>
general Applauſe given to the ſaid Sermon, by many of our Party-Zealots, ſo far influenced us, as to incite us to read ſaid Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon again; and upon the beſt Peruſal we could make of it, we are ſo far diſappointed, that tho' Mr. <hi>Tennent,</hi> in ſome of his former Sermons, gave us tolerable Satisfaction; yet in this he ſeems to us to have fallen into ſeveral palpable and unhappy Miſtakes, which have influenc'd him (as we think) to expreſs himſelf otherwiſe than according to Truth, and Chriſtian Chari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty: if we have been any Ways miſtaken herein, we are very willing to ſubmit the Paragraphs we have extracted, and our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marks thereupon, to your more mature Judgments. To proceed then in Order, we ſhall in the firſt Place take a curſory View of the <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory,</hi> ſo that we may make an orderly Entrance, and let us come out as we can.</p>
            <p n="1">I. Epiſtle Dedicatory, Paragraph the Firſt, <hi>"I thought it proper to dedicate to you the following Sermon, which I have deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered among you, as a Teſtimony of my Regard for you, and Deſire that you might be directed in the Choice of a Miniſter, that ſo that important Affair might be managed to your ſpiritual and immortal Benefit.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> I. When it was Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi>'s profeſſed Aim to direct the People of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> in the Choice of a Miniſter, doth not he ſeem to be very deficient in giving them proper Directions for that Purpoſe? For what can we find, that looks like Directions, but the following Paragraph in pag. 30, 31. <hi>And O! that vacant Congregations would take due Care in the Choice of their Miniſters! Here indeed they ſhould haſten ſlowly. The Church of</hi> Epheſus <hi>is commended for trying them which ſaid they were Apoſtles, and were not, and for finding them Liars. Hypocrites are againſt all know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of others, and judging, in order to hide their own Filthineſs; like Thieves they flee the Search, becauſe of their ſtolen Goods: But the more they endeavour to hide, the more they expoſe their Shame. Does not the ſpiritual Man judge all Things? Tho' he cannot judge the Eſtate of ſubtle Hypocrites infallibly; yet may he not give a near Gueſs, who are the Sons of</hi> Sceva, <hi>by their Manner of Praying, Preaching, and Living? Many Phariſee-Teachers have got a fine long String of Prayings by Heart, ſo that they are never at a Loſs about it; their Prayers and Preachings are generally of a Length, and both as dead as a Stone, and without all Savour.</hi> Dixi.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> II. Tho' we join with Mr. <hi>Tennent, That vacant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations ſhould take due Care in the Choice of their Miniſters;</hi>
               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:004792_0004_100DED96D21C7598"/>
it being a weighty Concern of the greateſt Importance on many Accounts; yet we wou'd ask, What ſort of a Proof of due Care is haſtening ſlowly? or how will both conſiſt? For is not the Danger of thoſe Sheep that want a Shepherd great, as well as that of thoſe who have only unconverted Miniſters? For is not a dry Morſel, or half a Loaf, better than no Bread? And is not the Privilege of a Goſpel-Miniſtry, ſo precious, as to deſerve all poſſible Speed in procuring it? Or is it ſuppoſed, that a ſettled Miniſter will ſtand in the Itinerant's Way or Light? If there be any ſuch ſpiritual Men in vacant Congregations, as can on the bare Hearing of the Declaration of Men's Experiences, preſently tell, whether they are carnal or converted; where is the Prudence or Care in being tardy, when it can be diſpatch'd to a good Purpoſe at once? Or if the Members of vacant Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations dare not truſt their own Skill herein; would it not be a good Deed, if the Congregation be able, to pay <hi>Ten</hi> or <hi>Twenty Pounds</hi> to a new-faſhion'd <hi>Rabbi,</hi> for a Viſit, who can in an Hour or two, by keeping a Judgment-Meeting, gueſs the Matter at once, and then pronounce the Judgment with as much Authority, as if he ſat in <hi>Peter</hi>'s Chair? Or if the Congregation be poor, would it not be a Deed of Charity in ſuch Rabbies, to give a vacant Congregation ſuch a Viſit <hi>gratis,</hi> or only upon their paying a ſmall Modicum to bear the Charges of their Journey? And when in ſettled Congregations every Member is ſuppoſed to be endowed with preſent Skill, to judge the Itinerant more gifted and gracious, and the Pariſh Miniſter leſs gifted or carnal, How comes it to paſs, that a whole Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, when vacant, are or ought to be at a long Stand before they can poſſibly gueſs the Point; unleſs it be that the carnal Miniſter, upon his Removal, hath carried away the <hi>Urim and Thummim,</hi> out of the Bounds, among the reſt of his <hi>ſtolen Goods;</hi> and the People, tho' they have Materials to make new ones, yet for want of a Leader, muſt ſpend a long Time in melting and forging them out? Or is this to ſuit their Matter to People's Inclinations, who naturally caſt off, but are ſlow to take on them Chriſt's eaſy Yoke?</p>

We grant, <hi>That the Church of</hi> Epheſus <hi>was juſtly commended for trying them which ſaid they were Apoſtles, and were not, and for finding them Liars.</hi> Why then ſhould thoſe Miniſters and Congregations be diſcommended by ſome, who ſuſpect ſuch ordinary Miniſters, who put themſelves in a Level with Chriſt's
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:004792_0005_100DED9A65AE1A58"/>
Apoſtles, if not with Chriſt himſelf, at Seaſons, by pretending to an immediate Call and Miſſion to the Miniſtry, to cloak their Diſorders and Want of Conformity to Goſpel Rules; and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to act and think by the immediate Guidance of Divine Inſpiration, to palliate Errors and Enthuſiaſtick Rovings; yea, who pretend to have done greater Things than Raiſing dead Bodies, for Proof of their pretended inward Manifeſtations; when in Reality there is nothing done, but an artificial Raiſing of the tender Paſſions of the weaker Veſſels, and making of Parties and Factions, by glaring Sights, Sounds and vain Boaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings? Will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tell us, what Names ſuch high Pretenders deſerve? For if by <hi>the Sons of Sceva,</hi> Mr. <hi>T.</hi> means falſe Pretenders to extraordinary Gifts and Works, we will readily grant, that by the Help of Scripture-Rule, by the viſible Failure of their Performances, and the Names of Blaſphemy written in their Foreheads, Men may do ſomething more than give <hi>a near Gueſs</hi> who are ſuch; for if there was not ſome ſure Way to know ſuch Impoſtors, how ſhould it be impoſſible to deceive the Elect?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> IV. Whereas Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> affirms, <hi>That Hypocrites are againſt all knowing and judging of others, in order to hide their own Filthineſs:</hi> What Allowance is to be made to different Climates, or whether Antipodes are endued with Diſpoſitions as oppoſite as their Situations are to each other, we will leave to long Heads; but we would deſire to know, in what World do thoſe Men live, that are <hi>againſt all knowing of others?</hi> Can it be ſuppoſed, that Hermits and Amazons are arrived to this Pitch of Hypocriſy? Or what Sect is that among Chriſtians, that are againſt all judging of others? For is not there a wide Difference between Men's being againſt poſitive and peremptory judging of Men's carnal or gracious State, and their being againſt all judging of others? For may not ſuch hold their Duty to make a probable Judgment of others, without contradicting themſelves in the leaſt? May not Men be againſt judging the Hearts of others, becauſe it is their firm Belief, that God alone is Judge concerning Regeneration, as to its internal real Principle and State in Men's Souls; and yet hold it their Duty to judge of its Evidences and Fruits in their external Demonſtration, ſtill leaving the Heart to God? May not Men be againſt making the ſecret State of Men's Souls towards God, the Foundation of Judgment concerning them, becauſe ſecret Things belong to God;
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004792_0005_100DED9A65AE1A58"/>
yet judge it their Duty ſo far to judge Men's Doctrines and Profeſſions, and their Deportment, as to be able to make a probable Judgment of Men's ſecret State, as a Concluſion inferred from the Judgment they are called to make of the Fruits and Evidences of Grace in their external Demonſtration or Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance? But if it were ſo, that Hypocrites are againſt all knowing of others; how then did <hi>Jehu</hi> venture to aſk <hi>Jehonadab</hi> ſuch a dangerous Queſtion, as, <hi>Is thy Heart right, as my Heart with thy Heart?</hi> unleſs he believed, that notwithſtanding <hi>Jehonadab</hi>'s Declaration, he was ſure to remain as ignorant of <hi>Jehonadab</hi>'s Heart as before? And if Hypocrites are againſt all judging of others, what unhappy Signs or Planets reigned in <hi>Judea</hi> in the Days of Chriſt's Incarnation, that had ſuch a ſtrong Influence upon the Scribes and Phariſees, as to over-rule their natural Bent; ſo that tho' Hypocriſy (of which they had a large Stock) fortified them againſt all judging of others; yet againſt Wind and Tide they judged Chriſt a Sinner, Deceiver, Traitor and Conjurer, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and damned the People that had reſpect to Chriſt and his Doctrine, for a curſed Crew that <hi>knew not the Law, Joh.</hi> 7.49. Can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> think, that he himſelf is more for judging others, than the Phariſees were? Nay, may we not defy the Pope to judge our Miniſters more than the Phariſees judged Chriſt? If there be any Hopes at all of Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s ſeeing his Error, may not we hope, he may ſoon eſpy it here? For doth not Scripture and Experience tell us, that it is the native Temper of the Hypocrite, to pretend to know and judge others, as well as to neglect looking into his own Heart? <hi>Mat.</hi> 7.1,—5. Is not his judging and condemning others, as well as his vain Pretence to know their Hearts, <hi>Satan</hi>-like in <hi>Job</hi>'s Caſe, one great Part of his Art to hide his own Deformity? For how can the Hypocrite be white, unleſs he firſt caſts Dirt upon his Betters, to make them look black?</p>

               <hi>Qu.</hi> V. Granting, That <hi>Thieves flee the Search</hi> by honeſt Men or indifferent Perſons, <hi>becauſe of their ſtolen Goods, and that the more they endeavour to hide, the more they expoſe their Shame;</hi> yet will not Thieves readily ſubmit to be ſearch'd by their own Familiars and Companions, and be glad of the Opportunity; becauſe they know before-hand, that the Judgment will fall in their Favour, by their giving their Judges a Share of the Booty? And will not this be a likely Way to make a Companion paſs for a legal Witneſs, when Trial comes? Let the Query then be
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004792_0006_100DED9C2CA4DD10"/>
Whether ſuch Candidates as are unwilling to be tried and judged by indifferent Perſons choſen by the Synod, but run into a favourite Preſbytery, contrary to a late Agreement made in the Synod; or thoſe that are willing to ſubmit to Examination both by the Synod and Preſbytery, look moſt ſuſpicious in the Point?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> VI. Is not Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> after all the Noiſe made about a carnal and converted Miniſtry, obliged to give up the high Pretence of the ſpiritual Man's Ability to diſcern the true Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtian from the cloſe Hypocrite? When after a bold towring Queſtion, which at the Propoſing of it, would ſeem to promiſe no leſs than a compleat Victory, viz. <hi>Doth not the ſpiritual Man judge all Things?</hi> Well, but will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſay, that the ſpiritual Man can make a poſitive Judgment of the ſecret State of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors? No; he intends no ſuch Thing; for doth not he anſwer his own Queſtion, (1) Negatively, by ſaying, <hi>that he,</hi> i. e. the Spiritual Man, <hi>cannot know the State of ſubtle Hypocrites infallibly;</hi> (2) Poſitively, by propoſing a very modeſt Queſtion, thus, <hi>May not he,</hi> that is, the ſpiritual Man, <hi>give a near Gueſs, who are the Sons of</hi> Sceva, <hi>by their Manner of Praying, Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and Living?</hi> If it were not for what fore-goes and follows, would not this be apt to tempt a Body to think, that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is as ſober in his Judgment about judging of others, as any of his Brethren? For might it not puzzle any Body to demonſtrate the Difference between near Gueſs and probable Judgment? Nay, of the Two, is not the latter, in Propriety of Speech, more than the former? And if this were conceded, would not the Controverſy on this Head be at an End? But yet it may be ſaid, that ſeeing the Scope of the whole Sermon ſeems to imply, that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> would have Men believe, that they may know a converted from an unconverted Miniſter; or elſe would not the main Part of the Fabrick fall? May it not therefore be objected, that we are to take Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s <hi>near Gueſs</hi> in its due Connexion with what foregoes and follows? And if it be thus, muſt it not intend ſomething more than a probable Judgment; or elſe doth not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> knock under? Suppoſing then, that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> by a near Gueſs means ſome Degree of Knowledge beyond a Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility, as the Scope of the Performance ſeems to dictate, and as his Partizans ſeem <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004792_0006_100DED9C2CA4DD10"/>
or the Truth? May it not be juſtly feared, that the near Gueſs which Men can make of the ſecret State of others, may prove to be no more than a poor blind Gueſs by Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s Rule? And can it amount to any more, in an ordinary Way, than a Proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bility at the moſt, by a better Rule than his ſeems to be as yet? What can be the Meaning of this <hi>near Gueſs,</hi> if not, that we may <hi>almoſt</hi> come to know the Matter; for what comes only near the Mark doth not hit it, be it ever ſo near? And after all, tho' we haſten as ſlowly as <hi>Tom Long the Carrier,</hi> or even as ſlow as the Pope with his Reformation, by putting <hi>One Hundred</hi> Years at leaſt between every Step, and ſo ſpend the greateſt Part of the Life of the Father and Son in gueſſing; if we can arrive no farther than a near Gueſs, that he is either a true Saint or a ſubtle Hypocrite at laſt; had not People much better make an exquiſite Trial of what comes within the Verge of their Cognizance, and leave the reſt to God? Now in making Choice of a Miniſter, we own, that People ſhould conſult with God by Prayer for Direction, and with God's Miniſters as their Watchmen under Chriſt, make uſe of their beſt Judgments in trying the Suitableneſs and Sufficiency of the Gifts, and Sound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Doctrine, and Blameleſsneſs of the Character and Life, and good Appearance of the Faithfulneſs of the Candidate; if in theſe he gives Satisfaction, ought not Men to judge him a gracious Man? If notwithſtanding a Man's good and comforta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Appearance in the Particulars aforeſaid, Men proceed to make Gueſſes of Miniſters gracious or carnal States, without, beyond, or contrary to the well-grounded and conſiderate Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, formed upon due Trial of his Gifts, Orthodoxy, and Regularity, as aforeſaid; will any tell us how it will be practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cable to follow Goſpel-Rules in the Choice of a Miniſter? For let us ſuppoſe for Arguments ſake, even more than we can grant in the Point, that the ſpiritual Man can know the cloſe Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite from the true Chriſtian, without ſeeing or perceiving any external Fruits of his Hypocriſy any way; is not the Choice of a Miniſter, if regularly carried on, to be the Act of the whole Congregation, and accordingly all the Male Members are to have a Vote or Voice therein? Now in Caſe there be any unconverted Members in the Congregation, will not theſe be uncapable of judging in this Matter, and of Conſequence muſt not ſuch be debarr'd of their Vote? And of Conſequence muſt not the whole Choice be devolved on the converted Part,
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:004792_0007_100DED9F3B85DAA0"/>
to judge and chuſe for the Whole? But then how ſhall this be done? For firſt how ſhall the converted Part be known? Muſt not Men learn to ſwallow one Error after another to ſupport a <hi>Diana?</hi> For muſt not Men ſuppoſe, and then believe, without and contrary to Scripture Evidence and Experience, that every one that is in a State of Grace knows it? And when that is done, muſt not they ſuppoſe and believe in the ſame Manner, that true Converts can both know another, and can diſtinguiſh them from the Unconverted? Well, Men may pleaſe themſelves with theſe fine Notions, as thinking they have got the true Philoſopher's Stone; but then, when they come to Practice, will they tell us, how ſhall the Unconverted again know the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted, in order to chuſe them for Voters? Or have true Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers, or thoſe that call themſelves ſo, a Right to chuſe a Miniſter for themſelves and their unconverted Neighbours, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe all is theirs? What if the converted Part again diſagree in their Choice, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas</hi> did about <hi>Mark?</hi> Or can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> think, that the unconverted Part of <hi>Nottingham,</hi> to which People this Sermon is dedicated, will freely act an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plicit Faith in the Skill of thoſe who call themſelves converted? Or will not they rather think, that it is their inviolable Right and juſt Privilege to chuſe for themſelves? Is it not therefore evident, that ſuch Enthuſiaſtick Notions can ſerve no other End, but to build a <hi>Babel</hi> on the Ruins of a Goſpel Church and Order? Beſides, is it not notorious, that Candidates paſs their Trials as faſt and as eaſy (if Reports be true) in <hi>Brunſwick</hi> Preſbytery, as in any other in our Bounds? How elſe comes it to paſs, that ſuch as had no Scruples to comply with the late Act of the Synod, till they went thither, choſe to paſs their Trials there, when, as Things appear, there was no Probability of their ſettling there?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> VII. Granting, that <hi>many Phariſee Teachers have got a fine long String of Prayer by Heart, ſo that they are never at a Loſs about it;</hi> yet may not a gracious Man, that hath the Spirit or Gift of Prayer, equalize them herein? Or is a ſhort Prayer the beſt Proof of the Spirit of Prayer always? Yea, grant that <hi>their Prayers and Preachings</hi> may be <hi>generally of a Length;</hi> yet will any ſay, that they are any Worſe for that? For may not Study, Skill and Experience help the gracious Man to ſuit his Prayer and Sermon to the allotted Time, when he is under an Appointment to preach twice a Day, and that in two different
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004792_0007_100DED9F3B85DAA0"/>
Places ſome Miles diſtant one from another? Grant, that to ſome of his Hearers, a Man's Performances in both <hi>are as dead as a Stone, and without all Savour;</hi> may they not be lively and ſavoury to the Unprejudiced for all that? Was not this the Caſe with CHRIST and <hi>Paul?</hi> Where is the Wiſdom of pelting witty Sentences or Apothegms at the Reader's Head, as Boys do Snow-balls, which with equal Eaſe and Execution may be retorted? For is it not eaſy to render trivial Matter plauſible to the Ear, when we are cheated with the Charivary of ſounding Braſs, and the Ditty of a ſounding Cymbal?</p>
            <p>Par. II. Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> ſaith, <hi>If any ſhould object againſt the Stile, and ſays that it is too pointed; I anſwer, that it is no keener than the Reflections of Chriſt himſelf againſt the old Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees. So far as I know my Heart, it is Grief for the Injuries that have been done to the Church of God by natural Miniſters, that has extorted ſuch Acrimony from my Pen.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> I. Granting, that Chriſt uſed as keen Reflections againſt the Phariſees, as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> uſeth here; yet with what Face can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> compare the Body of the Clergy of this Generation with Phariſees, who were degenerate in Principle and Practice, yea, not only natural, but alſo unnatural in many Principles and Prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tices? <hi>Mat.</hi> 15.4, 5, 6. Beſides, with what Face can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſet himſelf upon a Par with Chriſt, who knew what was in the Hearts of the Phariſees, as being GOD-MAN, and therefore knew how to point his Arrow to the proper Mark, without any Danger of miſſing it? Is Chriſt's Example, or even the Example of inſpired Writers, who were guided by an infallible Inſpiration in pronouncing bitter Reflections or Curſes againſt or upon par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Perſons, imitable by others who want ſuch an Inſpiration? Or is it not irreconcilable to the Law of Love, under which Chriſtians are? Beſides, doth not Chriſt point out the Crimes in Principle or Practice of thoſe, whom he reflects upon, and not raiſe a general blind Out-cry againſt them? If Acrimony be fit for one Miniſter, why not for all? If for Miniſters, why not for Church-Members? For are not they to follow their Leaders in what they follow Chriſt? Yea, may not they take a little more Liberty than their Teachers? For are not ſome of them well paid for their Gravity; whereas the People are obliged to be ſober at their own Coſt? And ſo who muſt be a Pattern of Meekneſs, but the poor natural Man? And how ſhall he be either, for he is for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bid to meddle in Things ſacred? O ſtrange! what will be the End of theſe Things?</p>

               <hi>Qu.</hi> II. May not we aſk Mr. <hi>T.</hi> if he had Reaſon to reſent the Injuries done to the Church by ſome natural Miniſters, as he calls them, which he ſignifies to have extorted ſuch Acrimony from his Pen; is the unnatural Acrimony of the ſpiritual Man's Words or Behaviour, or bitter Railings, and diſorderly general Clamours, fit or valid Proofs of his Spirituality? Or are they fit or proper Remedies to cure the Wounds made by the Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions of others? Or do not theſe ſmell as ſtrong, and ſavour as Rank of the Fleſh, as thoſe very Corruptions Men pretend to purge by them? If ſome had given juſt Offence, doth Mr. <hi>T.</hi> do well to be angry with all, or moſt of his Brethren, upon this Account? Is not there a great Difference to be made between thoſe that prove diſorderly, and were rejected for their Diſorders, and thoſe that remain ſtill orderly; albeit they differ from Mr. <hi>T.</hi> in ſome diſputable Points, which are not as yet fully deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined? For may not the other Side be in the right, for aught hath appeared as yet? Have not ſome of Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s. Opponents about the late Act of the Synod, given as good Proofs (if not better than Mr. <hi>T.</hi> or his Party ever did) of their firm Attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to Truth and Order; and have they not appeared to as good Purpoſe as he, againſt the Diſorders of ſome diſorderly Brethren, who were ſwayed, by their Corruptions, to act like Weather-Cocks, by turning with the Tide of Luſt, Gain or Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plauſe? Have not ſome Miniſters, by their much longer ſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing than himſelf in the Miniſtry, been a Means to convey the Truths of God to him and his Equals? And did not ſuch deſerved<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly gain a good Reputation for their Works Sake, before he came to the Stage? And conſequently do not ſuch deſerve the Reſpect of Fathers from him? Was it any Sign of Prudence or Piety in <hi>Rehoboam</hi> to reject the Counſel of the Elders that ſtood before his Father, and to make young raw Novices his Counſellors? And will any tell us, what will become of Truth and Order among us now? For muſt not ſome Miniſters in all Appearance make a bold Stand againſt the Catholick Tide of Errors and anarchial Diſorders of the preſent Time, which are propagated among us by Mr. <hi>W.</hi> and <hi>T.</hi> and their Adherents, who make it their Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſſneſs to juſtify and palliate Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Errors; and to throw in ſome Grains of their own to make good Weight, and good Meaſure preſſed down, to the confounding of Truth and Order? If the Injuries done by natural Men can excuſe the Acrimony dropt from Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Pen, muſt not he bear with the Complaints
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:004792_0008_100DEDA14A2682C0"/>
of thoſe that are condemned for natural Men without Proof or Trial? For doth not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> condemn the Body of the Clergy of this Generation in the Lump for Phariſees? If Injuries have been done as aforeſaid, ought not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to mourn rather than glory and be puffed up, as he ſeems to be? And ought not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to take good heed to his own Ways and thoſe of his Party, who call themſelves ſpiritual Men, leſt that they by their Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, anarchial Diſorders and Intruſions, do greater Injuries to the Church in a few Mont<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap> than they and others can mend in an Age? And ſeeing there is ſuch an Appearance of Pride, Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perciliouſneſs and Love of Pre-eminence, as well as of Ill will to and Contempt of his Brethren and fellow Chriſtians, in his keen Reflections and raſh Cenſures, is not there juſt Ground for Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to aſk his own Heart a ſecond Time, whether there be not ſome other Reaſon in the Matter, beſides what his Heart gave him an Account of upon the firſt Enquiry? Did not Chriſt queſtion <hi>Peter</hi> thrice? Beſides, we would deſire to know, how this will juſtify any Expreſſions or Practice, that is diſagreeable to Goſpel Rule? For did not <hi>Paul</hi> walk in all good Conſcience even while a Phariſee? <hi>Acts</hi> xxiii. 1. And even when he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the Church, did not he do it in Zeal? <hi>Phil.</hi> iii 6. And may not Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Heart be a deceitful Heart as well as the Hearts of others? And will not the Diſorders of thoſe that call themſelves ſpiritual Men in our Day be injurious to the Church, by grieving the Godly and hardening the Wicked, as well as <hi>David</hi>'s Sins did of old; and the more they are palliated and juſtified, the more injurious ſtill?</p>
            <p>Par. III. Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> vindicates his Performance againſt an Objection, which he foreſaw might be made againſt it, becauſe of its <hi>Inconſiſtency with Church Rules;</hi> which we ſuppoſe refers to the Encouragement he gives to People, to leave their own ſtated Paſtors, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> To this he offers two Things by Way of Anſwer, <hi>viz,</hi> 1. <hi>That there is great Difference between the flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſhing and declining State of the Church.</hi> 2 <hi>That every general Rule admits of Exceptions.</hi>

Whereas all Church Rules are or ought to be well founded on Scripture or the Light of Nature, no other Rules being according to our profeſt Principles neceſſary for the Being, nor conſiſtent with the Well-being of a Goſpel Church; And if the Rules Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſpeaks of, be not of this Kind, but thoſe of meer human Invention; What Need was there of an Apology
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:004792_0009_100DEDA35554C120"/>
from a Proteſtant Diſſenter for contradicting Rules, which are profeſſedly pronounced null and void by the whole Party, of which he is a Member? Have not we therefore juſt Reaſon to think, that Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s making of ſuch an Objection, and giving ſuch Anſwers to it, ſuppoſes the Rules to be of the former Kind?</p>

Is it not therefore obſervable, that every religious Sect or Society, in order to act harmoniouſly and unanimouſly among themſelves, have in their Turn thought it neceſſary to agree up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the true Meaning of Scripture Rules, or what appeared ſuch to them, as well as to fix and frame particular Rules out of ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Ones, for the well Government and Order of their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity in particular Affairs?

               <hi>Qu.</hi> III. Beſides, ſeeing the Controverſy of the Day is, in a great Meaſure, about the Extent of the Power of Communities, of making, forming or framing Rules for their own Society, and the Obligation of thoſe Rules when agreed upon, we ſhall en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to put the Matter in as fair a Light as we can, in order either to be reſolved or to reſolve others. We ſuppoſe it will be granted by all Hands among Non-Conformiſts, (1) That no Church Judicature, in making Rules, hath Power to make any thing neceſſary by their Determination, which is not one Way or other neceſſary, prior or antecedent, to ſuch a Determination; and therefore we reject the Notion of the Power of impoſing Things meerly indifferent, dubious or unlawful; but here the Query is, Whether or no Things may not become neceſſary for the preſent, by Reaſon of ſome Emergencies happening, which are not abſolutely neceſſary in their own Nature, nor made ſo by any poſitive Law of God in particular? Yea, may not Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances ſo far alter the Nature of Things, in their own Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture indifferent, as to make the Obſervation or Non-obſervation of them neceſſary in ſuch Circumſtances for the preſent; yea, ſo as to give Grounds to a Judicature, to determine the Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation or Non-obſervation of them neceſſary for the preſent, and as ſuch, to impoſe them upon their Community during preſent Circumſtances? How elſe could the Apoſtles and Church at <hi>Jeruſalem</hi> judge abſtaining from Things offered to Idols, Blood and Things ſtrangled, neceſſary Things? Is it not evident, that it was not their Determination, but the concurrent Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, that made abſtaining from theſe Things neceſſary, they only judging them ſo, becauſe Circumſtances rendered them ſo? And did not they judge, that the Neceſſity ariſing from ſuch an E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mergency gave ſufficient Grounds to impoſe ſuch a Canon for the preſent? <hi>Acts</hi> xv. 28. (2) Let it be granted, that no Church Judicature can determine any thing to be Duty, but what comes under ſome general Command of God, one Way or other, ſo that there is no Room to bring in any new Duties, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances or Orders; But yet the Query is, when the Duty is commanded plainly and expreſsly, but the Manner thereof is undetermined, ſo that there may be two or more Manners diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctively under the Command, ſo that the Duty may be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed this Way or that Way; whether or no ſome Emergencies or weighty concurrent Circumſtances may not require a Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, to determine one of thoſe different Manners preferable to
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004792_0010_100DEDA5190C1430"/>
the other, during the preſent Exigency, and thereupon enjoin the Obſervation of it for the preſent, until a better Expedient can be found out? For, is it not plainly demonſtrable, that what is beſt in itſelf is not always the beſt Expedient in all Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances; or elſe muſt not Neceſſity, that old evil and ſturdy Counſellor, be forced, will he nill he, to conform unto the Law? And ſuppoſing there be two Manner of Ways of Performing a commanded Duty, if the one be either difficult, hazardous or impracticable, during the preſent Circumſtances, when the other is eaſily accompliſhed to a good Purpoſe; if the one appears more ſubject to Abuſe than the other, or hath been abuſed, when the other appears ſafer and leſs ſubject to Abuſe; if the one appears more edifying than the other, or better adapted to ſecure the compleat and decent Performance of the Precept than the other, by Reaſon of ſome concurrent Circumſtances; is it any Infringment on Chriſtian Liberty, for any Society, in ſuch Caſes, to make it a temporary Rule for their own Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity, to obſerve that Manner of the two, which appears moſt apt to obtain the End, when both come under the Rule of God's Command; or to enjoin what is moſt expedient according to their beſt Judgment, during the preſent State of Things? If any will ſay, that this is aſſuming too great a Power in this Matter, will any tell us, where was the Church, Sect or Party of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, that were of any Standing in the World, that have not, in their Turn, aſſumed as much Power as is here claimed? (3) Let it be granted, as to Rules made in Emergencies, that the Neceſſity muſt extend as far as the Determination: for if they become neceſſary to one particular Church, and not to another, it will not oblige the other Church to come under the Impoſition, unleſs they come under the Neceſſity alſo: And ſo may not a Rule be neceſſary in one Time or Place, which is not ſo in another? (4) Let it be granted, that when the Neceſſity evidently ceaſes, the Impoſition in ſuch Caſes ought alſo to ceaſe, and the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of the Church may claim it as their Right, to be relaxed of the Burden, and may reaſſume their former Liberty, which the preſent Neceſſity did reſtrain: And ſo, may it not be the Duty of Synods as much to repeal ſuch Acts, when Circumſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces alter, as it was their Duty once to make them? May not we hence alſo ſee, that altering circumſtantial Rules occaſioned by Emergencies, when Circumſtances alter, is ſo far from being inconſiſtent with Reaſon or Religion, that on the contrary,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004792_0010_100DEDA5190C1430"/>
Men's Attachment to obſolete Canons, occaſioned by particular Emergencies, in or under different Circumſtances, would be a Proof of the Lameneſs of the one, and the ready Way to make the other to uſe a Crutch, when it hath no need of it. (5) Let it be granted, that no Judicature is to feign Neceſſities and ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginary Exigencies, as an Engine for ambitious Spirits, to try Concluſions upon Men's Conſciences, or to practiſe upon Men's Tameneſs; and therefore the Neceſſity ought to be ſuch as carries its own Evidence along with it to the unprejudiced; and that therefore Men ſhould be fair and above Board in pointing out the Neceſſity, and not to depend upon a meer Determination in the Matter: For doth not Experience prove, that Sparingneſs in pointing out the Neceſſity requiring ſuch Determinations, for Fear of offending ſome, hath often wronged a good Cauſe; and hath been a Means to help ſuch as were diſpoſed to quarrel, to carry their Reſentments higher, to the Offence of many? If any grant, that this Power of forming Rules in religious Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munities, ſhould be further limited than is here ſpecified, will they tell us what Limitations they want more? Or does our Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod claim or exerciſe more than is here contended for?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> IV. When therefore any Community, be it leſs or more Publick, after mature Deliberation, aſking Counſel of God, and conſulting with his Word and one another, do in a ſolemn Manner agree, that ſuch and ſuch Rules are Scriptural in one or other of the Senſes aforeſaid, and therefore meet Expedients to prevent Sin, or to preſerve Order, and therefore eſtabliſh them as aforeſaid in their Community; how is it conſiſtent with Reaſon or Religion, to ſuffer ſuch Rules to be counter-acted by particular Members, without calling them to an Account? If this be allowed in ſuch weighty Matters, as the Choice of a Miniſter, and the practical Diſſolving of the Relation between Miniſter and People, after the ſolemn Contracting of it with uplifted Hands, Faſting and Prayer, in Obedience to Chriſt's Inſtitution; why not in many more Caſes of leſs Moment? And ſo, if in particular Matters, Men are allowed to multiply Exceptions, as oft as their Humours move them, of what Uſe or Service will the general Rule be at laſt, excepting only to make a fair Shew to deceive the Simple? For is it not evident, that no general Rule can be put in Execution but in particular Caſes? If therefore it be neceſſary to make Exceptions, in any particular Caſe, againſt a general Rule eſtabliſhed in a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:004792_0011_100DEDA7649BBC10"/>
ought not all regular Members of ſuch a Community apprize their reſpective Community of ſuch Matters, as ſeem to require ſuch Exceptions, that ſo the Circumſtances of ſuch Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs may be ballanced and conſidered according to Merit, that ſo common Conſent may be obtained for making ſuch Excep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, if none be expreſſed in or under the general Rule already? How otherwiſe can Men expect to walk without giving their Brethren juſt Offence? Is not that Power too great which the Pope challenges, when he aſſerts his Right and Authority to diſſolve Contracts, Relations, and Obligations, at his Pleaſure, under the Pretence of the greater Good of the Church? And doth not he deſerve the Title of <hi>Man of Sin</hi> upon this Account, very richly? And can any ſuppoſe, it were poſſible for him to impoſe the Belief of ſuch a monſtrous Power, if it were not, that his Followers are firſt poſſeſſed with another falſe Notion, which makes Way for this, <hi>viz.</hi> That he can forgive Sins? Other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe would not the former be dari<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g to Reaſon and Religion? And to give every Church Member ſuch a Power as to his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to his own Miniſter, how monſtrous doth it look in a Proteſtant Country?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> V. That there is a vaſt Difference between the flouriſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and declining State of the Church is eaſily granted; for doth not Experience tell us, that in declining Times there are always ſome ingenious Fellows, who will juſtify any thing that ſeems to ſerve a Turn? But then, tho' there is a Difference between Winter-frize and a Summer Suit, a Wedding Garment and a mourning Gown, and between the flouriſhing and declining State of the Church, will it thence follow, that Men's Obligations to obſerve good Rules laxen or leſſen in declining Times from what they were in flouriſhing Times, as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> inſinuates here? Will not ſuch leaden Rules, that will gently bend with the Times, be a means, wherever they prevail, to make a crooked World ten times more crooked than it is? For what makes the Difference between the flouriſhing and declining State of the Church, but the careful and conſcientious, and the careleſs and hypocritical Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of Goſpel Rules and Order? Is it not therefore ſelf-evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the due Obſervation of good Rules, is the only Way to prevent and cure Declinings, unleſs Men would decline away the very Form of Religion, and bring it to Sun-ſet? In what Country was it found, that breaking thro' good Rules was a <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>ns of Reformation, much leſs a Step in it? Beſides, is not
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004792_0011_100DEDA7649BBC10"/>
our Standard of Doctrine and Diſcipline very good, and do not thoſe Miniſters, that are accounted carnal Men, keep to it in both, as well, if not better than Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and his Party do? And if there be any Declinings in Practice, is breaking induſtriouſly thro' good Rules the Way to mend the Matter? Will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> name the Miniſter of the other Side, who, in Pulpit or Preſs, ſo much countenanced breaking thro' Church Rules, as he doth here? And let him in a calm Hour conſider, whether or no, ſuch Miniſters as are not content with walking diſorderly them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves only, but alſo in the moſt publick Manner induſtriouſly encourage others to break thro' good Rules, in order to make Factions and Parties, do not appear to be in as declining a State as any other whomſoever? Are not they poor Empiricks, that preſcribe knocking Men on the Head, or cutting it off, to cure the Head-ach, albeit it may prove effectual?</p>
            <p>Par. IV. Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> adds, <hi>May the Lord ſcourge out Hire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings out of his Temple, and ſupply you with a faithful Miniſter, &amp;c.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> I. As to the firſt Petition, viz. That <hi>God may ſcourge out Hirelings out of his Temple,</hi> if we conſider it ſeparately, who more willing to ſay <hi>Amen</hi> than we? But yet, when we conſider what follows in the ſame Paragraph, viz. <hi>and ſupply you with a faithful Miniſter,</hi> and compare it with the Scope of the whole Performance, which is to condemn the Body of the Clergy of this Generation for Crowds of covetous Phariſees, muſt not the true Meaning thereof be, <hi>ſcourge out the Preſbytery of</hi> Donnegal <hi>and their Candidates, that there may be Room for</hi> Brunſwick <hi>Men,</hi> who are the only faithful Men in their own Eſteem, if Fame be not a cruel Lyar? And may not <hi>Donnegal</hi> Preſbytery well reply in the Apoſtle's Words, <hi>They zealouſly affect you, but not well; they would exclude US,</hi> as you have it in the Margin, <hi>that you may affect them?</hi> Gal. iv. 17.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> II. If Mr. <hi>T.</hi> judges not the Workman worthy of his Hire, why doth he take it? If the <hi>Hireling</hi> be he that takes moſt, let the Query be, Who got moſt at <hi>Nottingham,</hi> in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to his Labours, ſince the Deceaſe of the late Paſtor? Whether he that carries the biggeſt Bag under a Cloak, or he that carries a little one openly, be the <hi>Hireling?</hi> Or whether he that takes Wages at Home, and yet ſpends a great Part of his Time abroad, in order to increaſe his Wages, or he that tarries with his own Flock, as being content with a poorer Pittance by
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004792_0012_100DEDA9E575FF10"/>
far, be moſt worthy of the Name? Is it not notorious, that <hi>Brunſwick</hi> Men are as apt to remove for the Sake of richer Benefices as any other? Whether Hirelings would not take a very prepoſterous Method, by joining with Diſſenters, to gain their End, as Matters go in moſt Places, albeit, Providence is to be admired in making their little much in the Enjoyment? Yet have not we Reaſon to be thankful for our very great Liberty, which many precious Saints were deprived of? <q>But yet, may not he gape for Dignities and Honours, till he is Chap-fallen, whoſe Conſcience ſhall caſt his Lot among Diſſenters? And when he angled all Day, may not be come Home with a Diverb, ſaying, I have fiſhed fair and caught a Frog?</q>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> III. But to trace the Matter a little further, What ſort of Creatures are theſe Hirelings? Have we not their Picture pretty well drawn in <hi>Mic.</hi> 3.5. <hi>Thus ſaith the Lord concerning the Prophets that make my People err, that bite with their Teeth, and cry Peace; and if any put not into their Mouth, they proclaim a War againſt them?</hi> May not a ſmall Comment upon this Text, put the Matter in better Light, <hi>viz.</hi> Who is the Hireling, but he that cauſes the People to err, by encouraging them to break thro' good Rules, that bites with the Teeth of terrible Menaces and roaring Bulls? and if theſe tame any Aſſes fit for riding, will it not be Time to cry Peace, by proclaiming all tamed Creatures, Converts? But what elſe can be done to ſuch knotty Pieces, as will not open their Purſes or Butteries by either of theſe Ways, but proclaim a War againſt them, by damning them for a curſed Crew of carnal hard-hearted Phariſees, hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>critical Varlets, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> And then it follows by the old Rule, that no Faith is to be kept with Hereticks; and by the new Rule, are not all carnal Men ſuch? For who will dare ſay, that there is any Difference between a carnal Man and a corrupt Phariſee? But after all, tho' theſe Hirelings ſhould be ſcourged out of the Temple, unleſs the Church Doors be well guarded, and the Church Windows be well watched, that they do not re-enter by the one, nor climb up by the other; may it not be feared, that for every <hi>one</hi> that is driven out, <hi>ſeven</hi> will enter in at a Back-Door, as long as Catholick Anarchy prevails to keep an open Door to all Comers? And who knows but that the latter may be more hungry than the former; when 'tis well known, that <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s leaner Kine came up laſt? And was it not a little ſtrange, that the ill-favour'd Kine were of ſuch an untoward,
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:004792_0012_100DEDA9E575FF10"/>
envious Nature, that neither the fat Cattle, nor <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Grana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, could make them alter their ſhabby Ill-favour?</p>
            <p>Having thus taken a View of the <hi>Epiſtle Dedicatory</hi> and the <hi>Directions</hi> given in the Sermon, we now proceed to conſider the Main of the <hi>Sermon</hi> in order.</p>
            <p>The Text was, MARK vi. 34. <hi>And JESUS, when he came out, ſaw much People,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>We entirely agree with Mr. <hi>Tennent, That a faithful Miniſtry is a great Ornament, Bleſſing and Comfort to the Church of God, ſo on the contrary, that an ungodly Miniſtry is a great Curſe and Judgment.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If we miſtake not, the Conſideration of the Circumſtances of the Place, compared with the main Scope of the preſent Performance, affords us juſt Grounds to propoſe one general Query, by Way of Introduction, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> I. Whether it be not an effectual Way to comfort People, when under Sorrow for the Loſs of a Goſpel Miniſter, to poſſeſs them with the Notion, that what they loſt, was not only worthleſs, but alſo their Curſe, and that their Bereavement was a great Deliverance from a ſore Judgment, which put them in as fair a Way to obtain a great Bleſſing, as <hi>Rebecca</hi> did <hi>Jacob;</hi> ſo that if People underſtood their own Good, they ought not only to bleſs God for the happy Change, but alſo to awaken a much deeper Sorrow upon the Account of the Enjoyment of what they once wrongly counted their Mercy, but really was their Curſe? And ſo may not we learn hence the ſpeedieſt Way imaginable to comfort a poor diſtreſſed Widow, bemoaning the Loſs of her kind and dear Huſband; for what is it but telling her, that it was her blind Love and fanciful Fondneſs, that made her to think much of him, when in Reality he was the ſorrieſt Tool alive, good for nothing but to ſtand in the Way, and to hinder Room for a Better; or if he were not ſo, tell her it is her true Intereſt to bury the Memory of all his Endowments in the Ditch, and at leaſt feign him to be ſuch a one as is aforeſaid now, whatever he was; for what is a dead Lyon worth? And ſo divert Sorrow for the Loſs, with a greater Sorrow for the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, during her Days of Mourning; and this will ripen for a ſecond Match in a Hurry, when yonder brisk, topping Fellow comes, who is worth ten of what ſhe loſt. Or elſe let her try the Experiment; and will it not be probable, that ſome Body will gain his End, if the Widow be worth Money? Is this diſtinct Application? But to proceed.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="24" facs="unknown:004792_0013_100DEDABB7C03F50"/>Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi>'s Doctrinal Propoſition is, <hi>That the Caſe of ſuch is much to be pitied, who have no other but Phariſee Shepherds or unconverted Teachers.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Query</hi> I. Whereas Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> gives it as a Mark of Phariſee Teachers, <hi>That they are very indiſtinct in the Application of their Diſcourſes,</hi> pag. 9. We would aſk Mr. <hi>T.</hi> what ſort of Teachers are thoſe that are very indiſtinct in their Doctrinal Propoſitions? Will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tell us, how an Error in the firſt Concoction can be rectified in the ſecond? And can any be more indiſtinct in his Application, than Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is here in his Doctrine? For is not there a vaſt Difference betwen a corrupt, degenerate, blind, unnatural Phariſee Teacher, full of Bigotry to human Inventions, and an orthodox, regular, letter-learned, ſober, judicious, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing and gifted Miniſter, even tho' he were unconverted? But who can prove him unconverted while ſuch? Is there no Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between thoſe who induſtriouſly took away the Key of Knowledge, even Scripture, to make Way for their own Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions, and thoſe who induſtriouſly make Uſe of the right Key to inſtruct themſelves and others? Is there no Difference between ſuch abandoned Wretches, who for their ſore Abuſe of the Means of Light and Knowledge, were given up to Blindneſs of Mind, Hardneſs of Heart, Deafneſs of Ear; yea, to Pride, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luſion and Vain-Glory, ſo that they became thirſty Perſecutors, and virulent Oppoſers of Chriſt and his true Followers; for were not the Phariſees ſuch? And a natural Man, orthodox in Principles, regular in Practice, endowed with a great Degree of common Gifts of God's Spirit, ſuch as Knowledge, Convictions, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> capable of ſpeaking with the Tongues of Men and of An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gels, of underſtanding all Myſteries, and having all Knowledge? Tho' it be true that a natural Man may arrive to this Pitch; yet, who but blind Ignaroes, ſtuffed with Enthuſiaſms, will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to judge ſuch a one a natural Man, unleſs ſome different Fruit appears? Tho' we grant, that the Want of Grace may and doth hinder his own Soul's ſaving Benefit; yet ſurely, is not there a vaſt Difference between the Miniſtry of the one and that of the other, as to others, even as much as there is between Light and Darkneſs, Meat and Poiſon, Bread and a Stone, Fiſh and a Scorpion, Truth and Error, and between human Inventions and divine Inſtitutions? When therefore Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſeems deſigned<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly or inadvertently to jumble and confound theſe two together, in the Doctrine, and throughout the whole Performance, mak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing

We readily grant, that it would be the Duty of every one that duly regards his own Salvation, to forſake ſuch a cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Miniſtry as that of the Phariſees was; but we challenge Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and his whole Tribe to ſhew us that Scripture, which warrants a Church-Member to forſake an orthodox, regular Miniſter, upon a blind Gueſs of his carnal or unconverted State, when there is Nothing in his Principles or Practice to ſupport the Charge? For is it not evident, that Anarchy in Armour muſt be ſet up in God's Temple, if ſuch a vain Opinion once prevails?</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi>'s firſt doctrinal Query is, <hi>To enquire into the Characters of the old Phariſee Teachers.</hi>

But when Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is a great and a good Man, at leaſt ſaid to be ſo, what can be the Meaning of this, unleſs it be, on the one Hand, to force the Phariſee and natural Man into an Identity, by aſcribing unto the Phariſee all the Good that a natural Man may attain to, that ſo he might have ſome Colour to pelt the natural Man's Hide with all the <hi>bad Characters</hi> of the Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee? But yet, is not this as difficult a Taſk as the Blackſmith once undertook, <hi>viz.</hi> To mix the black and the white Horſe, in order to make one, of a mixt Mettle, of both? Muſt not the Caſe be deſperate, that requires ſuch <hi>poor Shifts</hi> to lay a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation for it? And muſt not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> have ſome high Mark in his View, to make him undertake ſuch an <hi>Herculean</hi> Labour as this ſeems to be? Could any thing leſs than advancing either Mr. <hi>W—d</hi> or himſelf into ſomething like a papal Chair, be a Temptation ſtrong enough for him, to poſſeſs him with ſuch a vain Notion, as that his bold <hi>Say-ſo</hi> will convince the World, that the <hi>Body of the Clergy of this Generation</hi> are, 1. <hi>natural Men,</hi> and becauſe natural Men, therefore, 2. <hi>Phariſees?</hi> Who muſt be the Perſons chiefly levelled at, but the Body of <hi>our Sy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nod?</hi> And, is there no Difference between the Principles of <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting Proteſtants</hi> or <hi>Preſbyterians</hi> and thoſe of the <hi>Phariſees?</hi> If the <hi>Pope's</hi> firſt Pair of Stairs were more rotten than theſe, was not he a couragious Fellow to climb them up.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> III. If the Phariſees were bigotted to human Inventions in Religious Matters, as ignorant of the Truth, as <hi>Nicodemus</hi> of the New-Birth, and looked upon the common People that reſpected Chriſt and his Doctrine, with an Air of Diſdain, How could they be called orthodox?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> IV. If Phariſees were proud, malicious, ignorant, cruel and Perſecutors; how could Mr. <hi>T.</hi> pronounce them regular?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> V. If they were ignorant, blind as Moles; how could Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſtile them letter-learned?</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="27" facs="unknown:004792_0014_100DEDAFBAEC9840"/>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> VI. If a letter-learned, orthodox and regular Man ſhould preſent himſelf to <hi>Brunſwick</hi> Preſbytery, in order to be entered upon Trials; how could Mr. <hi>T.</hi> according to Scripture-Rule reject him?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> VII. Can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> or any of his Party, give any Proof to others of their qualified Fitneſs for the Miniſtry, ſave only what appears in their Orthodoxy, Letter-learning and Regularity? Can any Church-Judicature make any Trial of Men, but in the above Particulars? Yea, can any Judicature of Men in an ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Way, form any Judgment of the gracious State of Miniſters or Church Members any other Way, but by the Evidences of Grace appearing in their Orthodoxy and Regularity? Can Men by the Declaration of their Experiences prove any Thing to others, but their Orthodoxy in ſuch Points of Faith or Holineſs as they profeſs Experience of?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> VIII. Whether the firſt Set of Characters Mr. <hi>T.</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtowed upon the Phariſee Teachers, be not their feigned and not their real Characters? If any of Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s Oppoſers ſhould give ſuch fair Characters to Phariſees, would it not be deemed Ground ſufficient to call him one of them? If Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will ſay, that he meant no more, but that they eſteemed one another ſuch; do not Papiſts, and even the very worſt Hereticks, count their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions or Party orthodox and regular? Will that give Ground to orthodox Proteſtants to proclaim and aſſert, that they are ſo in their publick Sermons and printed Books? Or is not this a plain caſting a Stumblig-block before the Blind to cauſe him to fall? <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.14. <hi>Deut.</hi> 27.18.</p>
            <p>But to proceed to the ſecond Catalogue of Phariſee Characters; if theſe were given only to the Phariſees, we might well join with Mr. <hi>T.</hi> by caſting in ſome more, and as material Ones, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe the Number; but as they are levelled againſt the Body of the Clergy of this Generation, particularly againſt the greateſt Part of the Miniſters of our Synod, with whom Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is at ſome Variance, as we apprehend the Matter; if Mr. <hi>T.</hi> or any other have aught to charge their Brethren with, ſhould not he and they come Face to Face, name Perſons and prove Charges, that ſo Judgment may be obtained againſt them according to Merit? Are not bitter outragious Railings, diſorderly general Exclamations, and general defamatory Libels, as contrary to the Goſpel Rules of Diſcipline as any other lawleſs Practice? But when contrary to all Reaſon and Equity Men are condemned
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:004792_0015_100DEDB24B103AC8"/>
without Proof or Trial, or even Summons to appear to anſwer for themſelves; can any take it amiſs, that we ſpeak a Word in their Behalf? If we ſuffer our Miniſters, who ſtand in the Front, to be thus unjuſtly condemned, what may we expect, but that our Turn will be next, if we appear for Truth and Order, againſt the Errors and Diſorders of factious-ſpirited Men? We ſhall therefore trace Mr. <hi>T.</hi> thro' the ſeveral Branches of the Phariſee Teacher's Character, and when we have offered but a ſmall Part of what we have to offer in the Matter, we ſhall leave the Unprejudiced to judge, whether Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and his Party, or his Oppoſers, act moſt conformable to the Character he aſſigns unto the Phariſee. When it is Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s Turn to be Carver, can he take it amiſs, that we ſerve his Brethren with the firſt Cut of Phariſee Characters? And if that will not ſerve him and them, is not the ſecond Cut large enough for Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and his Party? For when he frankly beſtows the firſt fair Set of Characters upon the Phariſees, doth not he aſſign over his Right to them under Hand, before a competent Number of Evidences; ſo that if his Brethren can but ſhew a better Claim to them than the Phariſees, muſt not the Trial or Judgment fall in their Favour? For how can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> claim Orthodoxy and Regularity in the preſent State of Things, when by his own Donation he hath made theſe the Phariſee's Property, without turning Phariſee? And will not this entitle him to the ſecond Set of Phariſee-Characters by his own Law? To bring the Matter then to a Deciſion, let the Query be, whether Mr. <hi>T.</hi> who hath reſigned, or his Brethren who have not reſigned, have the beſt Title or Right in the firſt fair Set of Phariſee-Characters, <hi>viz.</hi> Orthodoxy, Letter-Learning and Regularity? If they have not reſigned, are not they in Poſſeſſion? If Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath reſigned, muſt not he make a new Purchaſe, before he can come to have a legal Poſſeſſion? when therefore there is no Medium, muſt not giving up a Right in the firſt, be the procuring of a juſt Right in the ſecond Set of different or contrary Characters? which are as follows, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. The firſt Branch of the Phariſee Teacher's Character is <hi>Pride and Self-Conceit.</hi> We grant, that the Phariſee deſerved the Character; for doth not the Scripture tell us, that they were a People that truſted in themſelves that they were righteous and deſpiſed others, <hi>Luke</hi> 18.9, — 14. But as for <hi>loving the upper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Seats in the Synagogues,</hi> we query, whether that was a Part
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004792_0015_100DEDB24B103AC8"/>
of the Character of that proud Sect, and not the peculiar Character of the Phariſee Teachers? For doth not Reaſon and Scripture both allow, that the Pulpit ſhould be higher than the common Seats? For did not <hi>Ezra</hi> ſtand upon a Pulpit of Wood, and was he not higher than the People? <hi>Neh.</hi> 8.4, 5. Or will Men condemn <hi>Ezra</hi> for a wicked Phariſee, becauſe he was a Scribe? Would not that Man make himſelf ridiculous, who would call Mr. <hi>T.</hi> a proud Phariſee, becauſe when preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he maketh Uſe of a Pulpit within Doors, or a proper Stage or Balcony without, higher than the People, that his Auditors may hear the better? And doth not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> accept of the Title of <hi>Maſter,</hi> by way of civil Reſpect, and can he ſay, that others have done more, or conteſted with any about it? Or would Mr. <hi>T.</hi> that others ſhould reject it, that he may wear ſuch Feathers ſolely in his own Cap? Can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> with all his Skill in Rheto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rick tell the World, what is that material Difference, that is between him and the Body of the Clergy of this Generation in ſuch Matters? Where then is the Edification of turning Scripture thus into an empty Sound, by quoting it to no Purpoſe, but to amuſe the Weak, by making People believe that the Point is proved, when it is only darkened and palliated with Sounds? Who are <hi>more maſterly and poſitive in their Aſſertions</hi> than thoſe, who ſtrive to advance mere and falſe Opinions into the Rank of Articles of Faith, ſuch as, 1. That every one that is in a State of Grace, knows it. 2. That we muſt know, that our Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters are truly gracious, before we can know that they are called of God to the Miniſtry. 3. That a Miniſter muſt have Aſſurance that he is converted, before he can know that he hath a divine Call to the Miniſtry. 4. That a Miniſter muſt know that Chriſt is formed in the Hearts of his Hearers, before he can take Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort that he doeth Good. Will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tell us, whoſe Mark or Inſcription have theſe? and how can theſe be proved? Who are thoſe that look upon others that differ from them with more <hi>Air of Diſdain,</hi> than thoſe who (like the old <hi>African</hi> Conven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, much reviled and much imitated, who monopolized Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation to thoſe that were of <hi>Donatus</hi>'s Part) condemn all that differ from them, and judge them <hi>accurſed, carnal, hypocritical Varlets, Phariſee Teachers, covetous Locuſts,</hi> &amp;c.? Is there not a remarkable <hi>Air of Diſdain</hi> in theſe opprobrious Names, as well as in calling Men <hi>Dupes, Dunces, dead as Stones, blind as Moles, ſtone blind, ſtone dead,</hi> how can theſe be politick? Whereas
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004792_0016_100DEDB4D66E4F40"/>
as Matters go, is it not Men's Unhappineſs, if we may ſo call it, that they cannot wink ſo hard, as to overlook Mr. <hi>W—d</hi>'s and <hi>T.</hi>'s Errors and Anarchies? For is it not Matter of Fact, that thoſe who embrace crude Nonſenſe with an implicit Faith, are proclaimed knowing Men? If there be any Writings penned by the other Side, that have more or half as much of an <hi>Air of Diſdain,</hi> than this Sermon ſeems to have, let them be produced; for if any other bids more Gentleman-like for this Part of the Phariſee-Character than Mr. <hi>T.</hi> Would it not be Juſtice to adjudge it to him?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Branch of the Phariſee-Teacher's Character, is <hi>Policy and Craft:</hi> We hope it will be allowed by all, that to be wiſe as Serpents, and innocent as Doves, is wholeſome Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſel; but yet is not Craft another Thing? Did not he ſpeak home to the Point, tho' he ſpoke roughly and in haſte, who ſaid, <hi>You ſhall not meet with a Man in a Thouſand, but will liberally rail at damned Machiavelian Policy, which yet according to the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of their little Wit, they ſtrive to imitate; which tempts me to think, that they hate not ſo much his Knavery, as they repine at their own Folly; and judge not his Politicks ſo evil, as they are vex'd that they cannot equalize him; they nibble at his Principles, becauſe they cannot reach his Wit.</hi> Might not a Man know by this Man's Words, that he was a politick <hi>Hugonot?</hi> Did not <hi>Satan</hi> more befool the Phariſees, by tempting them to enſnare Chriſt with <hi>their captious Queſtions,</hi> than they diſcovered their <hi>Policy</hi> in the Fact? Was not that leſs politick, than if they had attempted to bind <hi>Sampſon</hi> with Tow-yarn? And are not they as unpolitick, that attempt to build their Neſts high upon the Ruins of the Goverment and Order of God's Houſe, as well as of their Brethren's Characters, by putting themſelves and others in falſe Colours? For is not this kicking againſt the Pricks? But who are thoſe, that are moſt induſtrious to get <hi>the Applauſe of the Populace, and uſe moſt Craft, and ſly and ſneaking Methods, to keep the People in their Intereſts?</hi> What elſe but this is the meaning of Men's intruding into Vacancies in the Bounds of other Preſbyteries, into diſſatisfied Corners of ſettled Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, and their creeping into Houſes to lead captive the Silly? What means the Noiſe made of <hi>Catholiciſm and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation,</hi> as if Reformation conſiſted in an Indifferency about Truth and Order, and in Men's becoming ſuch Latitudinarians, as to have a Conſcience of between 70 and 80 Degrees of South
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004792_0016_100DEDB4D66E4F40"/>
and North Latitude; or in making the Church Doors wide enough to let in all Preachers, tho' never ſo erroneous and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>orderly? as if it was our Duty to keep fair Play between God and the Devil, without ſiding with the one more than the other; or as if Reformation conſiſted in changing Sides and Guides, and becoming Fire and Tow for Party, but as cool as Patience itſelf in the concerning Truths of the Goſpel, or even in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming diſorderly? What mean the diſorderly general Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations and Defamations of pious Miniſters, Phariſee like? What means the ſmoaky Whiff of pretended Charity, whereby Men profeſs a <hi>Willingneſs to die for their Auditors,</hi> whom it may be they never ſaw before, nor have had any intimate Converſe with them either before or after? Do not Men betray an high Degree of Ignorance, if not what is worſe, by pronouncing ſuch glaring empty Expreſſions? And do not others diſcover an high Degree of Sillineſs by admiring ſuch vain Flatteries? For who can be ſo ignorant, that allows himſelf to think, but may pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſently know, that Saying is eaſy; Doing, hard; Suffering, much harder, and Suffering unto Death, ſuch ſweating Work as the Living cannot well form proper Conceptions of, nor of their own Strength to go thro' it, while it is out of Sight and unfelt? For is not the beſt Man at the beſt Vanity and Nothing, and leſs than Nothing too? Beſides is not Ability to ſuffer for Chriſt, the Goſpel, or his Church, a peculiar Gift? <hi>Phil.</hi> 1.29. Can any ſuppoſe that God gives this peculiar Gift to any in quiet and peaceable Times, wherein Men have not the leaſt Call to Sufferings? Can any expect that ordinarily God will impart to us any more, than Grace to help in a Time of Need? <hi>Heb.</hi> 4.16. Can any think that the higheſt Stock of inherent Grace, that ever a meer Man was endowed with, is ſufficient to make one ſtand in a ſuffering Hour, without a ſuitable Supply from without of exciting and aſſiſting Grace? When therefore the Ignorant fondly admire ſuch glaring, empty Expreſſions; muſt not the underſtanding Hearer have a vaſt Stock of Charity, before he can believe, that ſuch frothy Preachers are as much as orthodox in Principle, with reſpect to Sufferings, when their Mouths utter ſuch Expreſſions as ſavour ſo rankly of Ignorance and vain Confidence? Doth not the Devil preach more ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxly than this in <hi>Job</hi> 2.4.? What mean the vain-glorious Boaſtings of themſelves, and the high Praiſes Men beſtow upon one another in Publick? Who uſeth moſt of <hi>Abſalom</hi>'s Wiles in
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:004792_0017_100DEDB693945828"/>
the Gate, to ingratiate themſelves with the People? What means the Outcry made of the Church's Danger, becauſe of her preſent Guides; and the Terrors and Flatteries ſounded? If <hi>the People</hi>'s <hi>Favour be the main Chance;</hi> who hath obtained moſt Succeſs in ſecuring this as Proofs of their Diligence? Have other Miniſters uſed the ſame Wiles in the Bounds of <hi>Brunſwick</hi> Preſbytery, which tho<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="3">3. The third Branch of the Phariſee-Teacher's Character, is <hi>Cruelty and Malice.</hi> Will it not be hard for Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to inſtance any Acts of Cruelty, which the proteſtant Clergy of this Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, of any Denomination, have committed againſt any upon the Account of Religion, in our <hi>Engliſh</hi> Dominions? And is it not notorious, that edged Tools are pretty well taken out of their Hands? And have not many of them, of all Denomina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, given good Proofs of their being Men of a quiet, peaceable and harmleſs Diſpoſition, by their meek and inoffenſive Behaviour? And for all, that ſome of them, as well as of other Ranks, are fiery Zealots and Make-bates, will not the Body of the Clergy of this Generation afford a very conſiderable Number, that may juſtly be called merciful Men? We hope that all orthodox Chriſtians will own, that to aſſert Truth, to confute Er<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rors, to ſtop the Mouths of Gainſayers, to reprove the Unruly, to comfort the Feeble-minded, to ſupport the Weak, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Obſervation of Chriſt's Commands, and even to <hi>take the little Foxes, that creep in thro' Holes to ſpoil the Vines,</hi> is a commendable Practice in Goſpel Miniſters; But who are thoſe, that breath forth moſt of the Cruelty of Wolves, by an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prudent and an uncivil denouncing of Terrors, by damning and devilizing Men, giving the Devil more than his juſt due? Who are thoſe that diſcover moſt Malice, by aſperſing their Brethren, dreſſing them in Wolves Skins, by crying out <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, carnal Hypocrites, Ahitophels</hi> and <hi>Locuſts;</hi> drawing their preſumptuous Cenſures thro' the very Hearts of their Oppo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſers, even when they are in the Right in oppoſing them; tearing their Characters, marring their Uſefulneſs, diſquieting their Peace, encouraging their People to leave them without any juſt Reaſon for it, fomenting Factions, to the occaſioning the Removal of ſome Miniſters from their People, and the diſheart<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening of others? Was not it an Inſtance of ſome Cruelty, that ſome were guilty of, if Fame be not a Lyar, who were induſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious to hinder the Reception of a Miniſter in a ſecond Place,
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:004792_0017_100DEDB693945828"/>
when he was driven by a Storm of Contention from his proper Seat? What is that Truth or Power of Religion, that the other Side have oppoſed? Where have People been oppoſed in any of the regular Exerciſes of Piety? Can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> give any Inſtance of a Miniſter of the contrary Side, who raſhly judged their, or any of their ſpiritual State? And had not they a juſt Call to ſpeak againſt what was unſound in their Doctrine, as well as uncharitable and diſorderly in their Conduct, when contrary to God's Word?</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to <hi>Ignorance of the New-Birth.</hi> Hath Mr. <hi>T.</hi> or his Party advanced the leaſt Tittle or Scrap of divine Truth or Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacy in that Point, or any other Point of Divinity beyond what his Oppoſers did? Will not his Brethren, at his Invitation, be willing to confer with him on the Head, and compare Notes, whether he will privately or publickly? Or if they will not, ſhould not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> acquaint the Publick in Print, what are the Truths, relating to the New-Birth, which others oppoſe? Doth not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> diſcover an intolerable Air of Diſdain, if not ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is worſe, in his calling his Brethren's Preaching, when according to his own Conceſſion they do it orthodoxly, <hi>Prating?</hi> For is not this caſting Contempt on God's own Ordinance, when rightly adminiſtred? If Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath a Mind to divert himſelf, let the Query be, whether the old or new Method of Preaching be moſt like Prating? And may not the next be, Whether a great Part of the late Sermons of ſome be not down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>right Scolding and Railery, unfit for the Stage, much more ſo for the Gravity of the Pulpit? Did not he ſpeak pretty well home to the Point, who ſaid, <hi>He that will call Preaching Pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting, will hardly ſcruple to call my Ears Horns?</hi> What then?</p>
            <p n="5">5. As to <hi>Covetouſneſs,</hi> hath Mr. <hi>T.</hi> or his Party ever refuſed to take a good Salary, when they could catch it? Or did they ever refuſe a Place upon the Account of the Greatneſs of the Salary? Or have they been out of Humour, when Money was offered them? Will not Pockets ſometimes receive Money, without defiling Men's Hands with ſuch Traſh? Have not ſome of theſe Gentlemen removed from the Places where they were firſt ſettled, in order to better themſelves that Way as well as others? If all was known, would it not be merry Work to talk of great Salaries among Diſſenters; for are not theſe almoſt as rare as <hi>black Swans?</hi> Have not others accepted of, and content<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themſelves with as ſmall Salaries as any of theſe? Have theſe

Gentlemen any ſettled Miniſter in their Bounds, who received no more Salary from his People than between <hi>Eight</hi> and <hi>Ten Pounds</hi> this laſt Year, and the Year before laſt, no more than <hi>Thirteen</hi> or <hi>Fourteen Pounds,</hi> and for ſeveral Years paſt no much more? Will they ſend ſome of their able Hands, to take ſuch bulky and rich Benefices, if we tell them where they can get them? Is not there great Reaſon, why ſuch Miniſters ſhould be very careful to keep the People to their Favour? Or if their People ſhould combine with Mr. <hi>T.</hi> or his Party againſt them, can it be ſuppoſed, that they will ſpeak a Word againſt them for fear of loſing their Bread? Or will not ſuch bold Fellows, that have little or nothing to loſe, ſing boldly, when they ſee the Robbers coming, and whet their Knives at the Counter againſt the common Vogue, becauſe their Intereſt that Way is ſo low, that they are wholly out of Fear about it? If it be true, as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſeems to inſinuate, that the one fixeth his Eye on the Bag is it not notorious, that the other fingers the Money in their own Bounds, in Vacancies, faſter and plentier than they? And whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the feeling of a full Purſe, be not a better Prize to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vetous, than the Sight of an empty Bag? Have the other Side entered into theſe Gentlemen's Labours, as they did into thoſe of others, in order to get more Money? Or have not the moſt able Places got moſt Viſits from Itinerant Miniſters, when the Places that were wholly deſtitute of Preaching before, are neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected, except they lie in the Way to the Carcaſs? Was not the Invention of <hi>Bell</hi>'s Prieſts to get a rich Maintenance, under the Notion of Sacrifices to hungry <hi>Bell,</hi> a cunning Trick? And may not crafty Phariſees invent ſomething like it in theſe latter Days, which will bring in Money by the <hi>Hundreds?</hi> And will not Mr. <hi>Receiver</hi> fare the better of that, tho' Mr. <hi>Somebody</hi> gets Part of the Booty? But who more blind than they that will not ſee? Would it be any Breach of our Charter, if an Office was erected with proper Officers, to make a Cry in the Camp to all well diſpoſed Perſons, Who will <hi>throw in, throw in their Mites,</hi> to releaſe a penny Priſoner out of <hi>Turkiſh</hi> Slavery? How can this be done without a round Sum to purchaſe or hire a Veſſel for the Voyage, as well as to fit her with a proper Cargo to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fray accruing Charges?</p>
            <p n="6">6. As to <hi>Bigotry to human Inventions and ſmall Things:</hi> Was it any Fault in the Phariſees to be zealous and preciſe in ſmall Matters? For doth not our Saviour ſay, <hi>theſe Things ye ought to

Let the Query then be, Whether <hi>their ſwallowing the Camel or their ſtraining at a Guat</hi> was the Sin? Or is any-body obliged to ſwallow a <hi>Guat,</hi> becauſe it is ſmall? Is not the Authority great, when the Things in themſelves, prior to God's Commands, are but ſmall? Is not this to be ſeen plainly in <hi>Adam</hi>'s firſt Sin? And as to <hi>Bigotry to human Inventions,</hi> if Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath aught to charge his Brethren with on that Head, ought not he to deſcend to parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars, and ſpeak out, that they may be either foiled or cleared? In the mean Time, will he tell us, what but human Inventions or worſe, are, 1. The general, diſorderly and ſeemingly malici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Exclamations againſt Miniſters in the Lump; 2. The Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of poſitive judging Men's carnel or gracious States, by or upon Men's Declarations of their Experiences, and erecting So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cieties for this Purpoſe, as one main End of them; 3. The vain Pretence of ordinary Miniſters to an immediate Call to the Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry; 4. The induſtrious hiding or concealing of Goſpel Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes, or the Grace thereof, for a Time, from convinced Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, in order to raiſe their Terrors and Diſtractions higher by the Law; 5. Their ſending Miſſionaries into Vacancies in the Bounds of other Preſbyteries, without their Invitation, and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt their declared Judgment, without as much as hearing their Reaſons, or ſtriving to ſatisfy their conſcientious Scruples in the Matter; is not this Lording it over their Brethren with a Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs? Is not ſuch a Practice not only inconſiſtent with our Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution, but alſo a Violation of the Rights and Order of all regular Societies in the general? Is not Goſpel Liberty a Right or Privilege to obſerve, and not to deſtroy Goſpel Order, much leſs can it be a Liberty to ſet up Anarchy in its Room? Should not Diſſenters, who plead for <hi>Liberty of Conſcience,</hi> let the World ſee and know, that they want not an univerſal Toleration of all Things; but a well bounded Toleration to diſcharge their Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties to God and Man in their proper Places, Callings and Rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, without diſturbing others in their proper Stations? 6. What but an human Invention, is a Non-reſident, indefinite Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry? For is it not eaſy to ſhew, that it is ſubverſive as of Goſpel Order, ſo of a Goſpel Miniſtry? For either Men muſt
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:004792_0019_100DEDBAB2E80350"/>
own, that a ſtated Miniſtry is God's Ordinance, or not: If they ſay not, doth not their own Practice contradict that? If they own it to be ſo, are not Goſpel Ordinances not only inſtitutive of themſelves, as requiring their own Obſervation; but alſo excluſive, not only of what is directly oppoſite to them, but alſo of collateral Inſtitutions ſet up in Oppoſition to them? For how can there be Room to ſet up an itinerant Miniſtry, where there is a ſtated orthodox Miniſtry already, without ſetting up Threſhold againſt Threſhold, and Altar againſt Altar? And how can there be Room for that, unleſs there be ſuch weighty Differences between both, as will afford at leaſt one Side juſt Cauſes of Separation? And ſuppoſing there be juſt Cauſes of Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, muſt not Men, before they regularly clear the Way for it, uſe Goſpel Methods, by treating with their Brethren in a Chriſtian Way and Manner, in order to try all proper Meaſures of God's Appointment, to remove their conſcientious Differen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, whether by their own Reſolution or Conviction, or that of others? If Men divide abruptly without Cauſe, or if they have juſt Cauſes of an orderly Separation, without trying orderly Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thods to remove ſuch Cauſes, if poſſible, as aforeſaid; How can they clear themſelves of being guilty of making Schiſms?

For when there are Men of Learning on both Sides, can any think, that Grace extinguiſhes Reaſon now, no more than it did it in Chriſt and in his Apoſtle's, who ſilenced Gainſayers to the Face for all their ſilly Craft? And if Men had ſuch high Degrees of the Spirit of Wiſdom, as they ſometimes pretend to, would not they do the ſame with Eaſe to Men's Faces, without being obliged to uſe ſuch ſilly and ſinful Shifts, as general Cla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours and blind Puſhes, without naming particular Perſons or Crimes?</p>

Did not their Principles, who were full of Self-conceit of their own Holineſs, incline them to deſpiſe others? And do not Hiſtories tell us, that they counted the common People the Men of the Earth, reckoning them as the Dung thereof, judging them Sinners and prophane, yea even <hi>accurſed,</hi> becauſe they <hi>knew not the Law,</hi> i. e. as to their corrupt Gloſſes upon it, counting none Saints but ſuch as followed them, pronouncing Damnation to all others?

And is it not remarkable, that their abuſing the common People at an odd Rate, by caſting Diſdain and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon them, when it was done under the vain and ſpecious Pretence of Religion, drew the People after them in Droves, they being above all others in their high Eſteem and Veneration; when the honeſt <hi>Karraites,</hi> that ſtood up for the People's Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges, by rejecting and oppoſing their vain and burdenſome falſe Traditions, were ſcorned and deſpiſed?

How much of the like Principles appears in Men's publick, clamorous, and vain-glorious Boaſtings of their high Degrees of Grace, Comforts, Experiences, Feelings, and their Out-cries againſt others, that ſpeak againſt ſuch Practices, calling them carnal Men and Hypocrites, we leave others to judge at their Leiſure. Is not there a Spice of the ſame Spirit to be ſeen in the Practice of ſome Miniſters, who refuſe to aſſiſt their Brethren at the Sacrament, and to communicate when preſent, and aſſiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in preaching, upon a vain Conceit of their own Holineſs, and others being carnal Men; when for aught that appeared before or after, they could not fix a Charge againſt them in Principle or Practice; nor advance any Thing but their own Notions and Boaſts, true or falſe, to render themſelves preferable to others? Is not this plainly making vain Opinions or Traditions a Rule, when Scripture is wholly laid aſide? Would not Men of ſuch Principles, if once they had the Upper-hand, ſoon caſt others out of their Synagogues, when they thus excommunicate themſelves from God's Ordinances, in order to caſt an Odium upon their Brethren?

And do not ſuch faſten Terrors in the Hearts of the Righteous, whom God would not have made ſad?

And in one Word, what is Phariſaiſm but Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion dreſſed with a Cloak of Fervency againſt Atheiſm? Had Mr. <hi>T.</hi> inſiſted but a little upon and diſplayed the Leaven of the Doctrine of the Phariſees, how eaſily might he have proved, that ſuch People are to be pitied, who have no better than old Phariſee Teachers? And ſo, would it not follow, that if others now ſymbolize with them in Doctrine and Practice, that the Caſe would be plain? Which leads us to the ſecond Doctrinal Query, viz. <hi>Why ſuch People, who have no better than old Phariſee Teachers, are to be pitied?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>We could eaſily give our Aſſent to the Propoſition contained in ſaid Query, <hi>viz.</hi> That <hi>ſuch People</hi> as aforeſaid <hi>are to be piti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed,</hi> without any Proof at all; but yet, hath not the Impertinen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy and Weakneſs of Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Proofs a native Tendency to render the cleareſt Truth more ſuſpected, than it was in its own proper Light? For is it not evident, that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſpoils it in the Proof, by the ſame Indiſtinctneſs which we have ſhewn to be in the Doctrine, <hi>viz.</hi> His confounding the <hi>natural Man</hi> and the <hi>Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee Teacher,</hi> as if they were one and the ſame? Or rather doth not he in the Proof quit the <hi>Phariſee Teacher</hi> with his leavened Doctrine, and draw his Arguments wholly from the Defects and Danger of the <hi>natural Man's Miniſtry?</hi> We would be glad to know, what was the Reaſon, when the <hi>Phariſee Teacher</hi> was tied faſt to the Stake in the Query, that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> in the Proof puts the <hi>natural Man</hi> to do Penance, and to bear all the Blame, the <hi>Phariſee Teacher</hi> having no more but a By-blow at the moſt? Muſt not the Reaſon of this be, becauſe Mr. <hi>T.</hi> either reſpected the <hi>Phariſee Teacher</hi> more, or hated him leſs, than thoſe he calls <hi>natural Men,</hi> or rather would call ſo? We own it would have been an eaſy Matter, to prove many of the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees by all Appearance natural Men; yea, and that ſome of them were <hi>very unnatural</hi> too; but yet, would it not be too great a Taſk to prove, that natural Men are or were Phariſees? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="1">1. The firſt Argument then to prove, that ſuch People, who have no better than the old Phariſee Teachers, are to be pitied, is, 1. <hi>Becauſe natural Men have no Call of God to the miniſterial Work, under the Goſpel Diſpenſation.</hi> If this were true, how doth it prove the Point? For may not a natural Man's Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, if he be orthodox, vaſtly differ from an heterodox Phariſee's Miniſtry? Yea, doth not a private Conference with a private Chriſtian, or even bare Reading of Scripture by private Chriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, or even reading of good Sermon Books vaſtly excel a Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſee Teacher's Miniſtry? And if a Miniſter be gifted and ſound in the Faith, as well as regularly called, is not there a vaſt Dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference between the Miniſtry of one that preaches ſound Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Doctrine, and one that preaches vain Traditions and cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupt Gloſſes!</p>
            <p>But before we come to the Point, we may premiſe a few Things to prevent Miſtakes: We do then freely grant, 1. That Grace is abſolutely neceſſary to make a Man a true Chriſtian, and none doubts, but that a Miniſter ſhould be a true Chriſtian; nor do we ſuppoſe, that any among us will ſay, that without true Grace any can fulfil his Miniſtry acceptably, as to himſelf; and therefore it is very evident, that no Man can be looked upon, as fit to be called to the Miniſtry, but ſuch as are eſteemed gracious Men: So that it is not our Aim, in the leaſt, to plead for an unconverted Miniſtry; for we are againſt having ſuch as much as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> And if Mr. <hi>T.</hi> undertakes to prove any of our Miniſters ſuch, we promiſe upon good Proof made, to reject them forthwith; but the Query is, Who are to be eſteemed carnal Miniſters, or how to know them? 2. We grant, that it is the unqueſtionable Duty of every private Chriſtian, much more of a Chriſtian Miniſter, to examine himſelf about his State oft, and to labour diligently in the Uſe of appointed Means, to attain all poſſible Evidences of their gracious State. 3. That the Ordainers of Perſons to the Miniſtry, ſhould make an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Trial of the Gifts and Orthodoxneſs of Candidates to the

And when thoſe that are authoriſed by God for this Purpoſe, do in the Simplicity of their Hearts act according to their beſt Light, in Chriſt's Name, and according to his Inſtitution, in calling any into the Miniſtry, wherein Miniſters act miniſterially, with the Concurrence of the People, inviting or calling in a Way of Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel Privilege or Obedience to Chriſt; Is not every one that is thus called according to Goſpel Rule, at leaſt mediately called of God?

Whereas therefore Mr. <hi>T.</hi> in <hi>p.</hi> 7. aſks this Query, <hi>Isn't it a principal Part of the ordinary Call of God to the miniſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rial Work, to aim at the Glory of God, and, in Subordination thereto, the Good of Souls, as their chief Marks in their underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king that Work?</hi> We anſwer, that this is no Part of the divine Call to the Miniſtry, much leſs is it a principal Part of it; but the Duty of the Perſon called: The Call is God's Act either immediately or mediately, but this Aim is the Act of the Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didate in Obedience to the divine Call, whereby God calls Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons not to be Miniſters, but Chriſtians; for isn't it the Duty of all Chriſtians, as well as Miniſters, to aim at God's Glory, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> And can any think, that what is the Duty of all Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans in common with Miniſters, is any Part of the Call to the Miniſtry, which is a peculiar Office belonging to ſome only in the Church and not to all? And therefore we would aſk Mr. <hi>T.</hi> again,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> I. Whether or no the Candidate ought not to have this Aim, if he acts conſcientiouſly, before a Call be given him? Yea, whether or no he may not have this ſincere Aim many Years before a Call be given him? Yea, may not this Aim be in ſome who never receive a Call, by Reaſon of ſome providen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial Lets, tho' ſuch a Call was really once deſigned both by themſelves and others?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> II. If the Call to the Miniſtry conſiſts principally in ſuch an Aim, as is aforeſaid, will it not follow, that every Godly Man hath a Call to the Miniſtry? For will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſay, that a
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:004792_0023_100DEDC45712F3B0"/>
Man may be Godly, without having ſuch an Aim? And muſt not every Godly Woman have ſuch an Aim too, as well as the Godly Man? What Need then is there of uſing the Ivory Chair in chuſing Popes? For by this Rule, may not a ſecond Pope <hi>Joan</hi> be admitted in her Hoop-Petticoat? For who can ſay, that her Sex is any Hindrance to her having a good Aim?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> III. If the divine Call to the Miniſtry conſiſts princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally in ſuch an Aim; is it not in the Power of a godly Perſon to call himſelf with a divine Call, at leaſt as to the principal Part of it, and would not this be a flat Contradiction? And when he hath the principal Part of a divine Call in himſelf, may not he make a Shift as to the reſt, eſpecially if others are a little backward, as not being clear in the Matter? For how can he ſtop at Man's Judgment, if others judge him unfit, who knows, that he hath the principal Part of the divine Call? Can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> expect, that any but meer Enthuſiaſts, will join with him, in placing the principal Part of the divine Call in ſuch an Aim?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> IV. Doth not a divine Call not only authorize, but alſo require and oblige the Perſon called, to ſet about the Execution of his Office, as ſoon as Providence opens a Door for it, without any further Inauguration? And will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſay, that ſuch an Aim will warrant or juſtify a Man in ſo doing, tho' never ſo ſincere?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> V. If the principal Part of the Call to the Miniſtry conſiſts in the ſecret Aim of the Perſon called, how ſhall it be poſſible for People in an ordinary Way, to be ſatisfied about the Validity of the Call of their Miniſter, ſeeing it is well known, that the moſt notorious Deceivers have made the moſt vaunting Boaſts of their good Aims, to hide their bad Deſigns and anarchical Diſorders, for which this Notion opens a wide Door; for if this be admitted, may not every one that willeth, conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crate himſelf a Prieſt?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> VI. It is readily granted, that a natural Man, while ſuch, cannot aim ſingly at God's Glory; but yet when the Call to the Miniſtry doth neither in whole nor in part conſiſt in ſuch an aim; why may not a natural Man have a regular Call to the Miniſtry for all this? And this leads us to Mr. <hi>T.'s</hi> ſecond Attempt, to confirm his beloved Tenet, viz. <hi>That a natural Man hath no Call of God to the Miniſtry under the Goſpel Diſpenſation;</hi> which Tenet is made the He-Goat of the Flock, or the main Battering-Ram to win or keep the Fort: But here
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:004792_0024_100DEDC622FEF818"/>
we think it may not be amiſs to caution the Reader, not to be frightned at the odd Sight he is like to ſee; for if we miſtake not, he ſhall by and by ſee ſuch a Sight as <hi>Moſes</hi> his burning Buſh, <hi>viz.</hi> Scripture ſet on Flame by this Fire of Contention, burning, but not conſumed; but let him not fear; for 'tis only a Fire of one Man's kindling, and why may not another Man quench it, at leaſt with God's Help? Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s ſecond Confir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation of his Tenet or firſt Reaſon, ſeems to conſiſt of three Parts, <hi>viz.</hi> A Query before, a Query behind, and a Scripture Text in the middle, containing a Query to cement both; and here we cannot expect to make a quick Diſpatch; for doth not the Scripture ſay, that a threefold Cord is not eaſily broken? Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s Words are theſe, <hi>Are not wicked Men forbid to meddle in Things ſacred?</hi> Pſ. 50.16. <hi>But unto the Wicked, God ſaith, What haſt thou to declare my Statutes, or that thou ſhouldſt take my Covenant in thy Mouth? Now, are not all unconverted Men wicked Men?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Here, before we proceed further, we ſhall premiſe a few Words to clear the Way. We ſhall remark then, 1. That we are ſlided unawares from wicked Miniſters to <hi>wicked Men</hi> in general, and from the miniſterial Office to <hi>ſacred Things</hi> in general, and the unconverted Man is fairly excommunicated not only from the Miniſtry and ſpecial Ordinances, but from med<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dling with whatever Things that can be called <hi>ſacred;</hi> ſo that if this Rule ſtands, if the carnal Man makes or meddles in Things ſacred, ſuch as Prayer, Reading or Hearing God's Word, he muſt venture at his own Peril, by kicking againſt the Pricks, or bidding open Defiance to a plain divine Prohibition; and if this be not ſtrange Divinity, what can be called ſo? 2. Becauſe it is hard to venture at once to the Head of this horned Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, we ſhall take it by the Tail, and grant, that all uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Men may be rightly called wicked Men; but before we will yield any more, we will try the Force of a few Queries on the Head.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> I. If the wicked, <hi>i. e.</hi> the unconverted Man, be forbid to meddle in ſacred Things, will it not thence follow, 1. That Sins of Omiſſion are no Sins in an unconverted Perſon; for if it be ſuppoſed, that the Command makes Obedience his Duty, will not a Prohibition by the ſame Authority, releaſe as faſt as the Command binds? And is not there this Advantage in the Caſe, that the Prohibition binds always and at all Times? And
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:004792_0024_100DEDC622FEF818"/>
if Mr. <hi>T.</hi> could but prove this Doctrine true, would it not be worth its Weight in Gold for the ſlothful Servant, when called to an Account for hiding his Maſter's Talent, or tarrying idle in the Market-Place, under a Goſpel-Call? For if Mr. <hi>T.</hi> here declares God's Counſel, as he pretends to do, may not the ſlothful Servant tell Chriſt boldly, that the Reaſon why he ſat idle was, becauſe he forbad him to meddle in ſacred Things by the Mouth and Pen of his faithful Servant Mr. <hi>G. T.?</hi> Can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> think that Chriſt will admit of ſuch a Plea and judge accordingly, or that he himſelf will be able to ſtand his Ground in this particular.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> II. If the unconverted Man be forbid to meddle in ſacred Things; will it not follow, that Duties, ſuch as Prayer, Reading or Hearing God's Word, conferring about it, or medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tating upon it, are in their own Nature, or as Duties, as truly Sins in a natural Man, as Stealing, Lying, Idolatry or Adultery are Sins in a ſpiritual Man? For will not a Divine Prohibition, if there be any ſuch, make the forbidden Duty formally a Sin? And hath not ſuch a Doctrine a native Tendency to confound the Difference between Sin and Duty, Good and Evil, and to demoliſh the very Form of Religion, under a Pretence of advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing the Power of it? What a ſtrange Divine Law would that be, that would forbid Men that are under it, the Performance of the Duties required by it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> III. If the unconverted Man be forbid to meddle in ſacred Things; will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tell us, what ſhall he do? For if the Divine Law forbids him to perform Duty, or to meddle therewith; doth not it alſo forbid him to commit Sin, or to meddle therewith? And can any find a Medium in this World between both, or in the next either? And all the While is not Man ſuch a Creature, that cannot be wholly idle; and if God will not find him Work, can we think but the buſy Devil will employ him faſt enough? For is not the idle Perſon the Devil's Shop? It is well known, that an unconverted Perſon cannot exerciſe Grace, whereof he hath none, ſo as to be buſy in the Power of Religion; and if he be forbid to meddle in the Form, poor Soul! whither ſhall he go? What miſerable Preaching of Chriſt and the Goſpel have we here, where we have neither Law nor Goſpel? What can be the Reaſon, that ſuch a Man as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> thus halts at Noon-Day in a plain Caſe? Muſt not it be, either becauſe he did not conſider the Point, or elſe hath not
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:004792_0025_100DEDC852CC4568"/>
he imbibed ſome enthuſiaſtick Notions unawares? Is not there room enough for God to blame and reprove the carnal Man for going on in Sin, and his wrong and defective Performances, to require better Duties from him, as well as to declare the Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acceptableneſs of his preſent Duties; becauſe of his great Sins and Failures in the manner of the Performance of them, as well as becauſe of his Out-breakings otherways; without in the leaſt forbidding, but in all requiring him to meddle to a better Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe with ſacred Things, and to render unto God the Tribute of Obedience due to him from his Creature? Can any be ſo ſenſeleſs as to argue, that becauſe the Scripture ſaith, that <hi>the Prayer or Sacrifice of the Wicked is an Abomination to the Lord,</hi> as <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.27. and 28.9. that therefore God forbids all unconverted Perſons to pray or ſacrifice? For by the ſame Rule, may not Men prove, that God forbids the unconverted Man to plow his Ground, becauſe it is ſaid in <hi>Prov.</hi> 21.4. that <hi>the Plow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the Wicked is Sin?</hi> And by parity of Reaſon, may not Men ſay, that God forbids the carnal Man to eat or drink, to buy or ſell, to walk or fit, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> IV. If God forbids the unconverted Man to meddle in ſacred Things, will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tell us, how did God ſo far approve of <hi>Ahab</hi>'s Humiliation, as to delay the Judgment threatned o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> his Houſe in his Days, upon the Account thereof? 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 21.29. Or was it any Miſtake in <hi>Peter,</hi> to enjoin the Duty of Prayer upon <hi>Simon Magus,</hi> when he ſaw him <hi>in the Gall of Bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Bond of Iniquity?</hi> Acts 8.22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> V. When a poor convinced Soul is ſorely humbled under a Senſe of its ſinful and loſt State, or elſe a Godly Perſon is ſorely oppreſſed with melancholly; is it not one of <hi>Satan</hi>'s moſt uſual Temptations, whereby he labours to enſnare ſuch, his poſſeſſing them with an Opinion of their Unfitneſs for any Duty; and would not he get double Advantage over them, if he could but poſſeſs them with ſuch an Opinion, as that God forbids all unconverted Perſons to meddle in ſacred Things? For muſt not he be a great Stranger in <hi>Iſrael,</hi> who knows not, that ſuch are the moſt likely to condemn themſelves for un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted? Whoſe Intereſt then will ſuch a Doctrine ſerve?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> VI. When the Propoſition to be proved by M. <hi>T.</hi> was, <hi>That natural Men can have no Call of God to the Miniſterial Work under the Goſpel Diſpenſation;</hi> is it not a little odd, that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> was obliged to run as far back into the Old Teſtament
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:004792_0025_100DEDC852CC4568"/>
as the <hi>Pſal.</hi> 50.16. to fetch his firſt and main Text to prove the Point? And after all will he tell us, how to apply this Text, to prove what is peculiar to the Goſpel Diſpenſation, without borrowing Help from ſome ſuch Maxim, as <hi>far ſought is good for Ladies?</hi> For doth not God ſpeak there to ſuch Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and Prieſts, whoſe continual Practice it was to offer continual or daily Sacrifices, as the Law required under the Old Teſtament Diſpenſation? And was not that Practice peculiar to the Old Teſtament Diſpenſation to diſtinguiſh it from the New? Where is Diſtinctneſs now? For would not this ſtrike againſt the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinuance of the Prieſthood in the Houſe of <hi>Aaron</hi> and Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> as much as againſt Goſpel Miniſters, unleſs they were converted?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu</hi> VII. Doth not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſtrangely wreſt this Text to ſerve a Turn, when he inſinuates, that God herein forbids the uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted to meddle in ſacred Things? For doth not God in the Context plainly forbid ſuch an Interpretation of his Words? when he ſaith in <hi>Verſe</hi> 8. <hi>I will not reprove thee for thy Sacrifices or Burnt-Offerings continually before me:</hi> For is it not remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that God, who foreſeeth all Things, calculateth his Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions here, as if he was purpoſely guarding of them againſt ſuch Cavillers, who would be apt to improve his Words contrary to his Intent to drive Men from their Duty, when it was his plain Intent to forbid their Sin, and not their doing their Duty in the leaſt? For doth not he ſay, <hi>I will not reprove thee for thy Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices,</hi> and is not this as much as if he ſhould have ſaid, as for this offering Sacrifices, O <hi>Iſrael,</hi> thou doſt well ſo far, that is thy Duty; I do not reprove thee for doing thy Duty, but do ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove of thy Diligence herein: Thy Sin is not thy offering Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices, but thy Sin is thy <hi>Covenant-breaking</hi> with God inſtead of <hi>paying him thy Vows,</hi> ver. 14. and thy diſhonouring God's Name by thy <hi>wicked and perverſe Converſation</hi> inſtead of <hi>order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it aright</hi> ver. 23. Doſt not thou ſee, O <hi>Iſrael,</hi> how incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent is thy vile and ſinful Practice with thy offering Sacrifices, and <hi>taking my Covenant in thy Mouth?</hi> What ſignifies thy of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering Sacrifices, tho' good in its Place, without Obedience to the moral Law, which is greater than the ceremonial One? What ſignifies thy making Covenant with God, if thou doſt not pay thy Vows? Does not thy breaking inſtead of paying thy Vows ſpoil thy good Deed in making them? What ſignifies thy making a fair Profeſſion by declaring my Statutes, doth not
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:004792_0026_100DEDCA0F98EF68"/>
thy wicked Practice mar all the Good that is in ſuch a Profeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion? To declare my Statutes is thy Duty, I do not reprove thee for that, but have not I juſt Reaſon to reprove thee for thy hating Inſtruction, and caſting my Words behind thee? When thou prayeſt, preacheſt and profeſſeſt in thy own diſorderly Way and for thy own Ends, what Glory have I thereby? Or what Acceptance canſt thou expect with God, tho' Men may praiſe thee? Canſt thou think that thy fair Profeſſion will be a Cloak thick enough to hide the Deformity of thy Theft and Adultery from me, tho' it may do it from Men for a Time? Canſt thou think, O vain <hi>Iſrael,</hi> that thy towring religious Show will ſtand thee in any Stead, if at the ſame Time thou giveſt thy Mouth to Evil, and thy Tongue to frame Deceit, by flattering thyſelf and others with vain Words to break their Vows, to caſt my Statutes behind them, and to go on in rebellious Diſorders contrary to the Rules and Order preſcribed in my Word? Yea, canſt thou think, that thy Sacrifices and fair Declarations will be acceptable to me, if thou joineſt thereto ſuch wicked Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, as ſitting as a cenſorious Judge and ſpeaking againſt thy Brother, by ſlandering thy own Mother's Son, by perverſe Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clamations and general Libels, repreſenting him as an Hypocrite and carnal Man, a corrupt Phariſee, a Dupe, a Dunce, and a Fool, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> God may for wiſe Ends ſuffer Men to ſwagger a while in ſuch irreligious and wicked Practices, and may ſuffer them to carry this under a religious Covert, and even to be proſperous therein; but will not there be Bitterneſs in the latter End, if ſuch do not repent in Time? For who will be able to ſtand before what is ſpoken in <hi>ver.</hi> xxi. 22? Will not God call to ſuch one Day as he did to <hi>Job</hi> in <hi>Chap.</hi> xl. 7, 8? What is there in all this to forbid the Unconverted to meddle in Things ſacred? For is not joining of a wicked Practice to a religious Form and a fair Profeſſion; and making the latter a Cloak to the former, the only Thing forbidden here? For who ſhould haſten faſter to meddle in ſacred Things, in due Order, than the unconverted Man, if we take Scripture for our Rule? Can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not God forbid the Treachery of a <hi>Judas</hi> Kiſs, without for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidding the natural Man to kiſs the Son, as all Converted or Unconverted are commanded to do in <hi>Pſal.</hi> ii. 12? Would not it be as good Divinity to ſay, that a <hi>Judas</hi> Kiſs is the fulfilling of that Precept, as to ſay the former? And does not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> in <hi>p.</hi> 19. encourage People to ſomething like this, where, if we take
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:004792_0026_100DEDCA0F98EF68"/>
him right, he would teach Men to cover their diſorderly Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drings from their own pious Paſtors upon ſecret Surmiſes, that others are more gifted than they, with the fair Shew of the <hi>Spirit of Meekneſs and Love?</hi> So that if they have but Braſs and Deceit enough to give their Miniſters ſuch a parting Kiſs as <hi>Judas</hi> gave for a Salutation to his Maſter, may not they ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Rule, bid them ſuch a Good-Night as the <hi>Raven</hi> gave <hi>Noah,</hi> without any Regard to preſent Relation, or former Kindneſſes or Benefits by them? For how ſhall he be a <hi>clean Mule,</hi> that will not give his Dam a <hi>clean Kick</hi> after get<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting a good Suck? Cannot God forbid the Deceit of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pudent Trollop, that makes a clamorous Noiſe about her Vows and Peace Offerings, to hide her filthy Market, which ſhe is ready to cry at every Corner, where ſhe can get Cuſtomers void of Underſtanding, without forbidding unconverted Men to make orderly Sacrifices and Vows? Cannot God forbid the Villany of ſuch Sacrificers, who had the daring Confidence to offer Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices to him with Hands polluted in the Blood of their Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, without forbidding the Unconverted in <hi>Iſrael</hi> to offer Sacrifices? <hi>Iſa.</hi> i. 10 — 15. Who can doubt but that ſuch bloody Villains, as had Confidence enough <hi>to ruſh upon the thick Boſſes of God's Buckler,</hi> would be ready enough, to ſerve a Turn, to ſwear by the great <hi>Oſyris</hi> a thouſand Times, that they had a very tender Conſcience? And might not they give their <hi>offering Sacrifices</hi> and <hi>abſtaining from eating</hi> Black-Puddings <hi>throughout the whole Year or Lent</hi> for Proofs thereof, without telling the World, that they loved <hi>Wine and Eggs</hi> better than ſuch Fare? But to return to the Point, when God endowed unconverted Men with the Gifts of Prophecy, and of Working of Miracles, like thoſe ſpoken of in <hi>Matth.</hi> vii. 22. Or with the Gifts of an Apoſtleſhip as <hi>Judas,</hi> and gives them a Call and an Opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to exerciſe ſuch Gifts for the Good of his Church, was it their Duty to obey or diſobey the Call, ſuppoſing them to be in Doubts about their State? Or in ſuch a Caſe, that when a Perſon gives ſuch ſatisfying Proofs of his being duly qualified for the Miniſtry, as to Gifts; having alſo ſuch a fair Appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of Grace in his Orthodoxy and Regularity, as encourages others to call him to it, tho' neither he nor they are ſure of his gracious State, ought ſuch a one to tarry in <hi>Jericho</hi> till he gets Aſſurance? Or ought not he, with an humble Reliance on
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:004792_0027_100DEDCBA445FAF0"/>
God's Grace, to accept and obey the Call given him; or, at leaſt, may not he do this in Faith?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> VIII. Doth not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſtrangely confound that Text in <hi>John</hi> 10.1, 9. by making the <hi>Door of regular Entrance</hi> into the Miniſtry, ſpoken of in <hi>verſ.</hi> 1. and the <hi>Door of Salvation,</hi> ſpoken of in <hi>verſ.</hi> 9. one and the ſame? Is this Diſtinctneſs too? For what orthodox Proteſtant doubts, but that Faith in Chriſt is the Way of Salvation? But will any infer thence, that Faith is the Door of Entrance into the Miniſtry? For if ſo, will it not follow, that every true Believer, Male or Female, ſhould be admitted into the Miniſtry? For according to Mr. <hi>T.</hi> do not they come in by the Door? Is it not very ſtrange, that ſuch a Man as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> who blames others, and condemns them for carnal Men, for want of Diſtinctneſs doth thus confound Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters ſo different? For are not the Keys of the viſible Church, which open the Door of Entrance into Memberſhip and the Miniſtry therein, committed to Church Officers, to open and ſhut it according to Divine Preſcriptions? But doth not Chriſt keep the Key of the Door of Salvation at his own Girdle, and in his own Hand, as he tells us in <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.7. What elſe is <hi>the Key of David</hi> there ſpoken of? Beſides ought not Men to have Faith, or at leaſt deemed to have it, before they are looked upon as fit to be called into the Miniſtry, How then can Faith be a Door of Entrance into it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> IX. Whereas Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to confirm this falſe Gloſs, ſaith, that <hi>remarkable is that Saying of our Saviour in Mar.</hi> 4.19. What tho' it be true that <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Andrew</hi> followed Chriſt is a ſpiritual Senſe, Will it follow thence, that Chriſt will not make Men Miniſters, till they are true Followers of him in the ſame Senſe as they did? For is it not remarkable alſo, that Chriſt himſelf made <hi>Judas</hi> not only a Miniſter, but alſo an Apoſtle, tho' he was no true, but only a feigned Follower of him? And will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> pretend to be wiſer than the Wiſdom of God?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> X. Whereas Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſaith, that <hi>Chriſt reproved Nicodemus for taking upon him the Office of the Miniſtry, &amp;c.</hi> Doth not he miſrepreſent the Matter? For is it not evident, that his Igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in a fundamental Article of Faith, was the only Article he was reproved for? And may not any Miniſter, or even private Chriſtian, give Mr. <hi>T.</hi> or any other Miniſter, a modeſt Reproof, for diſcovering Ignorance in talking on any common Head of Divinity, without in the leaſt calling the Validity of their Call
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:004792_0027_100DEDCBA445FAF0"/>
to the Miniſtry into queſtion? Beſides might not <hi>Nicodemus</hi> be a Ruler of the <hi>Jews</hi> and a <hi>Maſter in Iſrael,</hi> without being a Miniſter? For were not Phariſees Civil as well as Eccleſiaſtical Rulers? And for aught that is written to the contrary, might not <hi>Nicodemus</hi> be of the former Rank, and ſo no Miniſter; unleſs it be thought, that their Civil Rulers were not dignified with the Title of <hi>Rabbi,</hi> or were not concerned in Scripture Knowledge, becauſe the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Government was wholly a Theocracy?</p>

That 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1.12. proves that <hi>Paul</hi> was <hi>a faithful Miniſter,</hi> we own; but we would deſire to know, what is there ſaid of the <hi>natural Man?</hi> Is not the Argument that runs from one to all very lame? For might not the ſingle Inſtance of an unconverted <hi>Judas</hi> be as well urged to prove all Miniſters unconverted?</p>

               <hi>Qu.</hi> XII. Whereas Mr. <hi>T.</hi> aſſerts, <hi>That the Devil may drive Men into the Miniſtry,</hi> we would aſk Mr. <hi>T.</hi> who are in greater Danger of being driven into it by the Devil, than ſuch who plead for an inward or an immediate Call in an ordinary Way, and place the principal Part of the ordinary Call to the Miniſtry in the Aim of the Perſon called? Who but the Devil drives Men into anarchical diſorderly Ways, contrary to Goſpel Rule and Order, under the Pretence of an inward Call? Further we ſuppoſe Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will own, that the Devil drives none into the Miniſtry without God's moſt holy and wiſe Permiſſion; is it any Way contradictory to God's moſt holy Perfections, to ſuffer others to be admitted into the Miniſtry, by the Door of a regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Call? Will God's Grace or Power be leſs glorious, if he works any ſaving Effects by the Miniſtry of ſuch? May not ſome ſuch be converted afterwards, and others be Caſt-aways after preaching edifyingly to others, tho' they had a regular Call to the Miniſtry, according to Chriſt's Inſtitutions? We own, that the Ordainers are under a Rule, and are to follow Chriſt's Preſcriptions, and ought not to commit the Miniſtry to any, but ſuch as have the good Appearance of faithful Men, and if any diſcover their Hypocriſy afterwards in the apparent Fruits of it, they ought to reject them; but yet will any infer from hence, that God is under ſuch a Rule?</p>
            <p>But to ſet the Matter in a clearer Light, we ſhall trace Mr. <hi>T.</hi> a little further: Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſays, pag. 8. <hi>But God ſends not ſuch hypocritical Varlets,</hi> i. e. <hi>into the Miniſtry.</hi> Muſt not Mr. <hi>T.</hi>
               <pb n="54" facs="unknown:004792_0028_100DEB6E8A606710"/>
mean then, that God ſends only gracious Men or true Believers into it? Whereupon we ſhall aſk,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> I. Is not that Act, whereby God ſends Believers into the Miniſtry, the Call of God? Will it not unavoidably follow, that thoſe Qualifications, ſuch as Faith and a good Aim, are not the Call of God, but ſomething different from it, and antecedent to it? Otherwiſe muſt not a Man be called before he is called, which is abſurd?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> II. If the Call to the Miniſtry conſiſts in theſe Qualifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, will it not follow, that no Perſon ought to enter upon the Work until firſt he be aſſured of his own gracious State, and that he hath true Faith? Again would it not follow, that every Miniſter ought to deſiſt from his Work, whenever or as often a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> he doubts or is uncertain of his gracious State; becauſe that in ſuch a Caſe, he is not ſure that he hath a Call to the Work?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> III. Suppoſe an empty Formaliſt or an Hypocrite to have been in the Miniſtry for ſome time, who afterwards comes to be awakened, and ſee and be convinced of his ſinful State; muſt he then in Conſcience lay down his Miniſtry, and look upon his Ordination null and void, becauſe he ſees himſelf to want thoſe Qualifications, in which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> makes the divine Call to conſiſt, l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ſt he further provoke God by running, and ſo incur that dreadful Challenge in <hi>Pſ.</hi> 40.16. <hi>What haſt thou to do to declare my Statutes, &amp;c.?</hi> For if theſe Words imply a Prohibition to the natural Man to meddle in ſacred Things; will not his Praying or Preaching be kicking againſt the Pricks? Again, if in ſuch a Caſe a Man's Call or Ordination be null and void, whether he muſt be re-ordained when or if he be converted?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> IV. If the divine Call to the Miniſtry conſiſts in theſe Qualifications, and we ſhould not hear ſuch Miniſters who are not called of God, how can a Perſon in Faith hear a ſtrange Miniſter, or any of whoſe Converſion he hath no Knowledge or Certainty, and knows not but that he may be one of thoſe Locuſts, or cruel covetous Phariſees, or hypocritical Varlets who are not called of God, and can do his Soul no Good, let his Gifts be never ſo great? And if he comes in a diſorderly or anarchical Way, will not there be more ground to ſuſpect it?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> V. If the divine Call to the Miniſtry conſiſts in theſe Qualifications, will it not follow thence, that the weak tho' true believing Miniſter hath not ſo good, ſo ſtrong or ſufficient a Call as the ſtrong Believer hath? Yea, may not the ſame Miniſter's Call
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:004792_0028_100DEB6E8A606710"/>
grow ſtronger and weaker as the Evidences of his Graces do ebb and flow? And would not the Aſſerting of both or either be ridiculous?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> VI. Whence then doth this Confuſion, under which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſeems to labour, proceed<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Doth it not proceed from his jumbling and mixing Things together, which are of a quite different Nature and Order, as if they were one and the ſame Thing? For doth not he confound the authoritative Call, Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion or Command of God, which is the divine Act, either mediately or immediately, with the Qualifications requiſite in the Perſons called, to render them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>it for the Work they are called to, as if they were the ſelf-ſame Thing? But are not theſe very different? For Inſtance, Was not both <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David</hi> equally called of God to the Kingdom? but yet were not they very differently qualified for the Office? Was not both <hi>Peter</hi> and <hi>Judas</hi> equally called to the Apoſtleſhip? but yet were not they very differently qualified for the Work? Had not <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thaniel</hi> theſe Qualifications before he received a Call? And who can ſay, but that it was ſo, with all the Apoſtles, except <hi>Judas?</hi> Doth not all this ſhew, that the Call to the Miniſtry is one Thing, and the Qualifications requiſite to fit for that Work another? What then is become of this towring Argument, which is the He-Goat of the Flock, in which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſo much triumphs? Doth not it fall flat to the Ground upon a ſmall Handling? For what is the whole of it but bare-faced Sophiſtry, candied over with rhetorical Strains? Can any think there is any Need to awake <hi>Sampſon</hi> to break ſuch Tow-yarn more than half rotten? Is this the Book that our <hi>Great Man</hi> counts <hi>unan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwerable?</hi> Can any lay any Streſs upon his Judgment and Commendations of Men, when it appears ſo ſhallow in Judging of Books?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> VII. We would further aſk Mr. <hi>T.</hi> whether the ſeven Deacons ſpoken of in <hi>Acts</hi> 6.5. were called of God to that Office before they were choſen by the Apoſtle's Direction or not? If they were, why did not they execute their Office before? If they were not called of God to that Office before, how can any ſay, that their Call conſiſted in their good Qualities? For is it not ſaid that they were full of the Holy Ghoſt before? Doth it not ſeem, that the Imbibing and Improving the falſe tho' vulgar Diſtinction between the outward and inward Call, the Call of God and the Call of Man to the Miniſtry, is the
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:004792_0029_100DEDCEB5082048"/>
Foundation of the above Miſtake in Mr. <hi>T.?</hi> If it were not for this, would it not be altogether needleſs to inſiſt upon a Thing ſo plain and obvious to any unbyaſſed Perſon, tho' but of an ordinary Capacity? We grant that the above Diſtinction will hold, and is clearly warranted by Scripture, when it is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied to the Goſpel Call to Chriſtianity; for Scripture tells us, that many are called by the Word, who are never called in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wardly by the Spirit: But is it not as evident, that God never appointed, and that Godly Men never uſed, nor could in Faith uſe, the Inſtitution of a Call to the Miniſtry, to convert Men, or to beget Faith in them? For in giving this Call, do not Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters and People call a Man to the Miniſtry, not to make him a Chriſtian or faithful Man, but becauſe they charitably judge him a faithful Man already, by the Trial made of him? Is it not very evident, that the Call to the Miniſtry is not given to convey Gifts or Graces to fit a Man for the Office, but to give a Man Authority and Opportunity to exert the Gifts and En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dowments, which he is judged to be endowed with, before a Call is given? Elſe, what Need would there be of making an exquiſite Trial of Mens Gifts and Fitneſs before-hand? We grant alſo, that there is a plain Diſtinction between an ordinary and an extraordinary Call to the Miniſtry, the one being me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate the other immediate, the latter was peculiar to extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Officers, ſuch as Prophets and Apoſtles; the former only is what ordinary Miniſters can in Faith expect. Where then is the Scripture Foundation for the Diſtinction between the Call of God and the Call of Man, the inward and the outward Call to the Miniſtry? We challenge Men to quote one ſingle Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture to ſupport this feigned Diſtinction in the whole Book of God: For is it not evident, that the outward Call, of which Men or Man is the Mean, Inſtrument or immediate Agent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when gone about according to Chriſt's Inſtitution and Direction in his Word, is the Call of God; yea, the only ordinary Call which we may juſtly name the Call of God? And is it not a reproaching of Chriſt's Inſtitution, to name it the Call of Man by Way of Diſparagement, to diſtinguiſh it from what we name the Call of God? Is not making Diſtinctions where the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap> is no Room for them, Phariſee-like, who diſtinguiſhed between ſwearing by the Altar and the Gift upon the Altar, the Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and its Gold, as indiſtinct a Way of Preaching as omitting Diſtinctions, where the Nature of the Matter requires them<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
               <pb n="57" facs="unknown:004792_0029_100DEDCEB5082048"/>
And is it not obſervable, by what we have ſaid already, that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is chargeable with both in this Sermon? And ſeeing he makes Indiſtinctneſs in the Application of Doctrines, one of the Characteriſtick Defects of the natural Man's Miniſtry, will he tell us in his next a Sign of what is Indiſtinctneſs in a ſpiritual Man throughout his whole Sermon? We grant, that ſome do run uncalled or unſent into the Miniſtry, as the falſe Prophets and falſe Apoſtles of old, and thoſe even now, that upon a Pretence of an inward and immediate Call enter into the Vine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yard in a diſorderly Way, diſagreeable to Chriſt's Inſtitution; but yet can any that are outwardly regularly called, be ſaid to go unſent or uncalled? For is not the Call to the Miniſtry an external Call, and is not the Effect of it an external viſible Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation in the viſible Church, as viſible between the Perſons calling and the Perſon called; or a viſible Separation of a Man to an Office and Authority in the viſible Church? For is it not evident that Offices and Officers have a Relation only to the viſible Church, and not to the inviſible? It is true, the Miniſter may and ought to be an inviſible Member of Chriſt's inviſible Body; but will any ſay, that there is room for or need of Miniſters to be inviſible Paſtors in the inviſible Church as ſuch? If then, there be an inward Call to the Miniſtry, muſt not there be ſome inward Effect of this inward Call, or elſe is it not in vain? To put the Matter in fairer Light if poſſible; In the Call of the Goſpel to Chriſtianity, there is a double Effect, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. An <hi>outward</hi> Effect, the Winning of Men to an outward Profeſſion and Memberſhip in the viſible Church and Duties therein. 2. An <hi>inward</hi> Effect, the Bringing of Men into a Memberſhip in the inviſible Church or Body of Chriſt, by or through a lively Faith; and therefore, is it not evident, that there is room for and need of an outward and an inward Call, the one by the Word, the other by the Spirit, in this Step? If any will ſay, that the Call to the Miniſtry is a parallel Caſe; will they be ſo kind as to try their Skill in running the Parallel, and we will promiſe Attention. When Men are choſen into any Church Offices, are not they choſen out of the Church, which is or ought to be an Aſſembly of Saints, in which none ſhould be admitted, and in which none ſhould be tolerated in full Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion, but ſuch as by their Profeſſion and Converſation, bear a credible Appearance of their being Saints indeed? When there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore Men chuſe a Miniſter, ſhould not they in all Reaſon chuſe
<pb n="58" facs="unknown:004792_0030_100DEDD050B33138"/>
an orderly Member, againſt whom there is no Charge of Accuſation depending, and who appears upon an exquiſite Trial and Enquiry, to be gifted, and ſound in the Faith, and regular in Practice? And yet when Men are but Men, ſhort-ſighted Creatures, may not the beſt and wiſeſt Men upon Earth, after all poſſible Pains, be foully miſtaken, as to Men's ſecret State of Grace, which none but God knows abſolutely, and thoſe to whom he reveals it? Yet when in Obedience to Chriſt, and according to his Inſtitution, they act a conſcientious Part in calling any to the Miniſtry; is not ſuch a one rightly and legally called to the Miniſtry; ſo that there is no Deficiency in the Call, whatever may be in the Perſon called? And ſo, who can deny but that <hi>Nadab</hi> and <hi>Abihu, Hophni</hi> and <hi>Phinehas, Judas</hi> and <hi>Demas,</hi> together with all the unconverted Men that ever entered into the Miniſtry in a regular Way, according to Chriſt's Inſtitution, had a divine miniſterial Call, tho' they wanted Grace, which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> names the Call of God? But is it not wrong thus to miſcal ſacred Things? For is not changing of the true Names of ſuch Things, the ready Way to loſe their true Ideas, and thereby to bewilder ourſelves and others, to the great Hazard of Truth?</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſecond Argument, to prove, that <hi>ſuch People who have no better than Phariſee-Teachers, are to be pitied,</hi> is, <hi>becauſe the Miniſtry of natural Men is uncomfortable to gracious Souls.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> I. But what is this to the Matter in Hand? For may not the Miniſtry of a ſpiritual Man be as uncomfortable to carnal Men, or even to ſpiritual Men under Decays and Slumbers; how elſe are Men made to cry and roar ſo loud at Seaſons? If Reports be true, have not ſome Hearers of late Sermons been made ſo uncomfortable as to chuſe Strangling rather than Life? Have not many more been put into ſuch Shocks and Fits, as made them Objects of Pity and Grief to moſt of their Beholders; when it may be thoſe who had got the <hi>Second-ſight,</hi> could rejoice at ſuch mournful Sights, in Token of their Tender-heartedneſs? Would it be ſafe then to call every Miniſter that will make his Hearers uncomfortable a carnal Man? Who then are theſe carnal Miniſters? <hi>Meſſrs. Somebodies, Meſſrs. Every Bodies,</hi> but <hi>Somebodies;</hi> and after all is ſaid, are not they <hi>Meſſrs. No-body</hi> knows them? Are not thoſe edifying Sermons wherein the Preacher makes clamorous Out-cries againſt Phariſees and carnal Men and Miniſters, upon meer Gueſſes; when for aught is ſaid in publick,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:004792_0030_100DEDD050B33138"/>
the Preacher may be levelling his Arrows againſt the <hi>Papal</hi> Crew in the <hi>German</hi> Empire; and ſo, as to the main Thing driven at, is not the Hearer obliged to return Home, after a tedious Journey, as wiſe as he went, only he hath got a Flea in the Ear, to put him upon making Gueſſes upon Gueſſes upon the Preacher's Out-cry, founded upon Gueſſes, and as his Humour ballances to the one Side or the other, will he not paſs his Cenſure, and draw it thro' the Heart of Some-body, to make the Devil Sport? O rare Edification! For what is raſh cenſuring and accuſing the Brethren on ſuch Footings, but Playing a Tune upon the Devil's Fiddle? But will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and his Party, firſt prove themſelves to be ſpiritual Men, by ſome ſtated Rules beſides their own bold Say-foes? And if the other Side afterwards will not venture as ſevere a Trial before indifferent Judges, will not the Way be in ſome meaſure cleared, to treat them accordingly? Beſides, Is not Truth much more comfortable than Error; and ſo is not there a great Difference between Hearing an orthodox Miniſter and an heterodox Phariſee as to Comfort? And may not a carnal Man greatly excel many a godly Man, in all common Gifts of Memory, Judgment, Oratory, Eloquence, as well as the Heathen Orators did, and ſo be able to deliver their Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſes with all the Advantage of Diction, Pathos, Emphaſis, Cadence and Accent? Doth not the Apoſtle plainly grant this in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13.1—3.? Beſides, when Miniſters are orthodox in Doctrine and regular in Practice (for if they be not ſuch, we plead not for them) How can Men know that they are uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted? When therefore the Word is preached in Purity by a Miniſter that is regularly called, behaving orderly, and who hath not forfeited his Character by falſe Doctrine or Miſbeha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour; ought not his Auditors chearfully and thankfully to attend there-upon, looking to God for his Bleſſing upon his own Ordinance, without needleſs and hurtful Jealouſies, Doubts or Queries about the Miniſter's ſecret State towards God? But to proceed,</p>

Tho' we own, that <hi>there is an Emnity between the Seed of the Woman and the Seed of the Serpent, and that this will be now and then creating Jarrs between unconverted Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters and godly People;</hi> and will it not do the ſame between unconverted People and a godly Miniſter, eſpecially if People counter-act good Rules, as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> adviſes them? If Miniſters are the Make-bates in every Quarrel between them and the

People, would it not be good Advice to get them indicted for common Barrators? Only leſt honeſt Men ſuffer Wrong, will it not be neceſſary to except the Raiſers of Feuds and Factions in their Brethren's Bounds, for peaceable Men? For who knows, but that this may make ſome of them love Peace the better for the future? Beſides will not the Relicks of Corruption in the godly Miniſters and People, often cauſe them to jarr and contend one with another, as <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas, Luther</hi> and <hi>Calvin, Hooper</hi> and <hi>Ridley</hi> did? And may not <hi>theſe poliſh their Pleas with Wit and Rhetorick, and gild them with the ſpecious Names of Zeal, Fidelity, Peace, good Order and Unity?</hi> How then ſhall we catch the natural Man with this ſhattered Net?</p>

Tho' tis true, that <hi>natural Men have no true Love to Chriſt, and the Souls of their Fellow-Creatures;</hi> yet may not they outdo a faithful Miniſter in pretending Love to both, as well as their Great Grandfathers the falſe Apoſtles outdid <hi>Paul,</hi> both in commending themſelves, and pretending great Love to Souls? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.12. <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.17. And did not their fair tho' falſe Pretences prove very bewitching to ſome? <hi>Gal.</hi> 3.1. Can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> produce any Writings, wherein any of his Brethren appear ſo void of Love to their Brethren, as he appears in the preſent Sermon? Or is the Tribute of Love fully paid to Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters already, ſo that the little Remainder of it left is due only to the People?</p>

And are not natural Men crafty Fellows ſtill; ſo that if they find that a little Warmth in the Delivery will give Money or Praiſe, will not the Love of Money warm them to a due Pitch, to offer the

Let <hi>Teaching with Authority</hi> be for ever aſcribed to Chriſt as his juſt Praiſe, who ſpoke in ſuch an incomparable Manner, that never a Man did or will ſpeak like him; but yet we would aſk, whether Men's ſpeaking with Authority conſiſts in furious Paſſions, ſtrong Voice or Accent, and maſterly poſitive Aſſertions and Harangues, without Order, Reaſon, or Scripture Proof; or in a clear ſtating of Truth, and confirming it with clear Scripture Proofs, with becoming Gravity, and commending themſelves not to the Ears, but to every Man's Conſcience, in declaring God's whole Counſel without Reſerve or corrupt Mixture? For is not the mighty Man in the Scriptures the moſt authoritive Divine, albeit his Language is leſs fluent than gaudy Rhetoricians?</p>

Is there no Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance <hi>of Anger</hi> in Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s proclaiming <hi>the Body of the Clergy of this Generation, ſwarms of Locuſts, Crowds of covetous and cruel Phariſees, who, if they could help it, would not let one faithful Man come into the Miniſtry?</hi> Did ever a diſſenting Proteſtant paint the Body of the Proteſtant Clergy in ſuch black and diſmal Colours, in any Age? Is not there barefaced Slander contained in theſe Expreſſions? Is there no Appearance <hi>of Anger</hi> in Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s pronouncing ſuch orderly Members, as content themſelves with and adhere to their own pious Paſtors, and will not ramble over the Pariſh-line to him and his Party, <hi>Dupes and Dunces, as blind as Moles, as dead as Stones, without any ſpiritual Taſte and Reliſh, poor Fools, ſilly Souls, &amp;c?</hi> But we ſhall meet thoſe Things in our Way again, and therefore paſs them here: Who are thoſe that are more guilty of ſtrengthning the Hands of the Wicked, by promiſing them Life, than ſuch who proclaim

diſorderly Ramblers, Criers, Roarers, and Tumblers, and Rowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, if not Demoniacks, <hi>Converts,</hi> and that upon the Account of ſuch odd Doings, whereas it is well known, that many ſuch behaved exceeding vile afterwards as well as before? Who are thoſe that <hi>faſten Terrors into the Hearts of the Righteous</hi> more than thoſe, who pronounce all in a damnable State, who do not know that they are in a gracious State? Whereas Mr. <hi>T.</hi> brings it in as a Charge againſt the carnal Men <hi>that they ſow before they plow;</hi> We would query, whether ſome Sort of Ground or Grain will not yield a better Crop in that odd Way? But how doth Mr. <hi>T.</hi> plow God's Vineyard, if not by ſowing God's Word? Hath he any Sort of Plow to prepare his Hearers before ſowing the good Seed? What have we here then but a jingling empty Sound? If the Meaning is, that Miniſters ſhould induſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly preach the Law and Terror to their Hearers firſt, and hide the Goſpel from them at leaſt for a Time, as it would ſeem to be, by what foregoes and follows; We would aſk, how is this poſſible in a mixt Multitude, without ſerving Men <hi>with a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Meſs?</hi> Whether feeding the Child or beating the Dogs is the main Care of the Nurſe? If the Children muſt be neglected for a Time, for fear that the Dogs may ſnatch away ſome Crumbs, or till the Dogs are ſo well laſhed as to run away or change their Nature, may not there be Danger of neglecting them too long? Where can we find that Wheat growing in the Field of the viſible Church, that is without Chaff and Tares? If ſo, will not there be as great a Danger, to preach the Goſpel an hundred Years hence, as there is now? What a fine giddy Counſellor is carnal Wiſdom in religious Matters? For is not the Goſpel the Foundation in the ſecond Covenant, how elſe ſhall Chriſt be the Foundation and chief Corner-ſtone? Is not the Law as a Rule, and a broken Covenant added as an Appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dix unto the Promiſe, as we read in <hi>Gal.</hi> iii. 19? Muſt we then always begin with the Appendix, or can we lay any Foundation for Faith or Goſpel-Obedience by the Law? Before Men con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn Miniſters for carnal Men on this Account, ſhould not they take heed, that they do not ruſh unawares upon the thick Boſſes of God's Buckler? For is it not evident, that the great <hi>Jeho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vah,</hi> whoſe Wiſdom is infinite, revealed a Saviour to fallen <hi>Adam,</hi> before he pronounced the Curſe of the firſt Covenant up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him? <hi>Gen.</hi> 3.15. Is it not one main Difference between the firſt and ſecond Covenant, that in the firſt the Law was
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:004792_0033_100DEDD5C6A11138"/>
before the Promiſe, but in the ſecond after it? And is it not impoſſible to place the Command before the Promiſe in the ſecond, without turning it to be a legal Covenant under ſome Form or other? Is not <hi>Chriſt's Sermon on the Mount</hi> one of the firſt and longeſt Sermons of his that we have upon Record, and doth not he therein pronounce the Beatitudes firſt? Might it not be ſuppoſed, that many of Chriſt's Hearers were as carnal as the Hearers of our Miniſters, who are ſtaged for <hi>carnal Men,</hi> for not conforming to <hi>carnal Rules?</hi> Was not it Chriſt's Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion to his Diſciples, when he ſent them forth, <hi>into whatſoever Houſe ye enter, firſt ſay, Peace be to this Houſe,</hi> Luke 10.5. And could they proclaim <hi>Peace</hi> by the Law to any <hi>one Houſe?</hi> Who the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

When Miniſter therefore have firſt laid down the Doctrine of Juſtification ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxly, agreeable to our Standard, and keep to it, how can they preſs or drive Men to Duty and good Order too much, in Po<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

Whereas Mr. <hi>T. pag.</hi> 11. charges carnal Miniſters thus, <hi>They love thoſe Unbelievers that are kind to them, better than many Chriſtians, and chuſe them Companions;</hi> We would aſk, whether Unkindneſs to his own orderly Miniſter be not a ſurer Sign of a factious Partizan than of a Believer? Whether Kindneſs to his own Miniſter, if he is clear in the reſt, be a proper mark of an Unbeliever? Or may not theſe Publicans by Chance go to Heaven before Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s unkind Saints? Is it not an hard Caſe, if there be Jarrs, whoever is in the Fault, <hi>the Miniſter is carnal:</hi> If there be Love between Miniſters and People, <hi>the Miniſter is carnal, and the Kind to him, Unbelievers;</hi> if he be of a calm Temper, <hi>he is cold and carnal and a Coward;</hi> if he is warm, and preſſes Men to Duty, <hi>he is a carnal Driver;</hi> if he comforts People, <hi>he is carnal, for he ſtrengthens the Hands of the Wicked;</hi> for none elſe will be ſo kind as to come and hear ſuch; if he reprove the Unruly and Diſorderly, <hi>he is carnal;</hi> for theſe are the Saints of the Day, however it may go here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>after, when the firſt will be laſt and the laſt firſt? Are not they born under ſome unhappy Planets or Signs, or elſe very unhappy in their Judges, againſt whom all Sorts of Premiſſes ſhall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude to their Diſadvantage? But yet will the Diſciple expect to be above his Maſter? If the Matter were really ſo, that thoſe that call themſelves ſpiritual Men prove unkind to the Miniſters, and thoſe that are accounted carnal Men are kind to them, grant they were really ſo, without they ſhew Love and Reſpect to ſuch in a civil Way, how can they be true Followers of him that upon the ſame Account was ſtiled the <hi>Companion of Publicans and Sinners?</hi> and who but Phariſees will be offended at them for ſo doing? <hi>Mat.</hi> 9.10, 11.

palliating of Errors, Anarchy and Diſorder, as well as Unkind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to and exclaiming againſt orthodox and regular Miniſters, are counted Signs of Converſion; is it any Wonder that Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Truth, Confutation of Errors, Preſſing of Duties, bearing Witneſs againſt Diſorders, is unpleaſing to ſuch irregular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verts; who, tho' they love dearly and are greatly edified in hearing others laſhed in a blind Way, yet they will not have their <hi>Tammuz</hi> or <hi>Dalilah</hi> touched with a Finger, for fear <hi>Dag<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

            <p n="3">3. Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s third Argument to prove his Doctrine, is, <hi>The Miniſtry of natural Men, is for the moſt Part unprofitable.</hi> And would not Somebody obtain his End, if by ſilly and ſinful Arts he could make the Miniſtry of thoſe, whom he calls, right or wrong, natural Men, not only for the moſt part, but altogether unprofitable and unacceptable in the World? When on the one Hand God is prayed unto, to confound them, and when this prevails not, do not Men take the Devil's Way by defaming, reproaching, falſe accuſing and cenſuring them, by oblique Inſinuations and indirect Suggeſtions, caſting Dirt in a blind Way, as if they were reſolved neither to act the Part of Friends nor of fair Foes; and can Men think that God will be always ſilent, tho' he may be for a time; or can they think God will be thus ſerved, and that the Intereſt of Chriſtianity will be thus promoted, or their own Ends will be gained in ſuch immoral, wicked and deceitful Ways, which Scripture and even Nature's Dictates reprove; and can any Thing but enthuſiaſtick Rovings fortify Men to act thus under a Cloak and Cry of Religion?

               <hi>Qu.</hi> I. As to real Benefit, may it not be juſtly feared, that the Miniſtry of the moſt godly Men hath been leſs profitable than the Pious could have wiſhed in all Ages, and in moſt if

But as for making Parties, ſuch is the Biaſs of corrupt Nature, that we would aſk, Who ever that had Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, Courage and Policy enough to paint groſs Errors with glaring Colours, but have been ſucceſsful, at leaſt for a Time, to draw Multitudes after them? Have not the <hi>Phariſees, Sad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducees,</hi> and <hi>Eſſenes,</hi> outdone the <hi>Karraites?</hi> Have not <hi>Theudas, Judas of Galilee,</hi> and <hi>Barchochebas,</hi> played their Pranks with Succeſs?

Have not <hi>Arrius, Pelagius, Arminius, Socinus, Fox,</hi> had their Tribes; and have not ſome of them too many ſtill? Had not Dancing <hi>Sacheverel</hi> his Mobs? And might not the Zeal of theſe in their Time, compare Notes with our preſent Rabble, unleſs Enthuſiaſm will help to make a better Story?

            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> III. We plead for no Miniſters who by the Unſoundneſs of their Doctrines or Miſbehaviour, give juſt Offence; for if any can be proven ſuch of either Side, we wou'd have Men join in diſcarding them, albeit they would pretend to be ſpiritual Men; for by their late Conduct we are afraid of none more than thoſe, that make a fair Shew in the Fleſh, and glory much in Appearance and deſpiſe others, who ſeem to have bid farewel to Charity and Goſpel-Order, and we are afraid are going to barter the Love of Truth, for Love to Mr. <hi>W—d,</hi> and his incoherent corrupt Scheme; and we would have our ſpiritual Watch-men to look diligently to it, leſt there be a Root of Bitterneſs ſpringing up, which may trouble them and defile many. In the mean Time ſay we, Let the <hi>Blind</hi> have proper Guides, and, if poſſible, Eye-ſalve; let the <hi>Dead</hi> be buried, or bury their Dead; let <hi>Mad-men</hi> be purged, bleeded and diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plined, and let Swords and Halters be put out of their Way; let <hi>poſſeſſed Men</hi> be bound, watched and prayed for; let <hi>Rebels
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:004792_0035_100DEDDAD3537E98"/>
and Enemies to God</hi> be ſharply reproved by Miniſters, and puniſhed by Magiſtrates, if upon Trial it appears they deſerve it; let the <hi>Captives of Darkneſs</hi> be pitied, inſtructed and prayed for; let <hi>Lepers</hi> be ſhut out of the Camp for ſeven Days, and if poſſible cleanſed; let <hi>ignorant Ruſticks</hi> have their Plows mended, or be put to Trades; let the <hi>Unconverted,</hi> if known, be put among Catechumens, and wait upon God in the Uſe of Means: Thus much of the rational Part of this Argument.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As to the Scripture brought to confirm it, <hi>viz.</hi> Jer. 23.32. <hi>Behold, I am againſt them that propheſy falſe Dreams, ſaith the Lord, and do tell them, and cauſe my People to err by their Lies and by their Lightneſs; yet I ſent them not, nor commanded them: therefore they ſhall not profit this People at all, ſaith the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> I. Was not there ſome Reaſon why Mr. <hi>T.</hi> Phariſee-like, quoteth Mr. <hi>Pool</hi>'s Gloſs upon the Text, inſtead of the Scripture Words themſelves; and who is he like, when he cites only ſuch a ſmall Part of the Gloſs, and leaves the Perſons there intended, wholly under a Veil for any Thing that is ſaid to diſcover them to his Readers? Was it <hi>Ignorance or Anger,</hi> or ſomething elſe, that prompted Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to <hi>miſapply this Text,</hi> by appropriating it to the Miniſtry of the natural Man in general, whether orthodox or heterodox? For who but Enthuſiaſtick Dreamers, that falſely pretend to an immediate Call and Miſſion, and to an immediate Guidance of a divine Inſpiration, or imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate Revelations, when in Reality they only declared their own Dreams and Fancies, and deluſive Experiences, who ran in a diſorderly Way, contrary to God's inſtituted Order, cauſing the People to err by preaching Lies and Lightneſs, and not ſound Doctrine, are the only Perſons here intended and ſpoken of? Is it not therefore evident to the meaneſt Capacity, that there is not a Word here that ſtrikes againſt an orthodox orderly Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter, that preaches ſound Doctrine, and is not turning its Edge againſt ſuch, a plain Perverting of Scripture? And we appeal to the whole World, whether or no Mr. <hi>W—d</hi> appears in his Writings to come within the Verge of this Text, more than any Miniſter of our Denomination within the Bounds of the Synod? And are not thoſe that are attached to his Enthuſiaſtick Notions, them that are next in the File? What then will become of Men's high Pretences to great Edification, in hearing Men preaching glaring Experiences, which to the Auditor can be no better than a waking Dream, whatever it be to the
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:004792_0035_100DEDDAD3537E98"/>
Preacher? For how is it poſſible for the Hearer to come to any Certainty in the Matter about ſuch Declarations, <hi>viz.</hi> Whether ſuch boaſting Accounts are deluſive Fancies, Deceits, or Reali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties? At the moſt, can the Hearer arrive to any more than a bare human Faith, in an ordinary Way, in ſuch Matters? And is not advancing an high Degree of human Faith, in Matters of Religion, the Bane of it, and the only Way to make Phariſee Rabbies, contrary to the plain Caution given in <hi>Matth.</hi> xxiii. 8, 9, 10. For who more blind than thoſe who have their Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences tailed to one Fore-Horſe? And if ſuch Relators appear deficient, as to Solidity, Orderlineſs, or Conſiſtency with Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Reaſon or themſelves, is not human Faith itſelf rendered thereby a doubtful Wavering, if Men do but act as rational Creatures?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> II. As to <hi>Experience of Succeſs or Unſucceſsfulneſs;</hi> Who that hath read any thing conſiderable, and allows himſelf Leave to think, but knows that this is a very precarious Rule to judge of the Goodneſs or Badneſs of Things and Perſons? For how often ſhall we find, that decoyed Villany hith been ſucceſsful, when real Virtue ſtrove againſt the Tide to no Purpoſe; how elſe could Chriſt ſay, <hi>I have laboured in vain, I have ſpent my Strength for nought and in vain?</hi> Iſa. xlix. 4. Will not the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances that we have given already of good and bad Miniſters, if duly conſidered, put the Matter in a fair Light? But to follow Mr. <hi>T.</hi> in his Ramblings; grant that there is too much Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of Security up and down, and that Miniſters may have their Share in the Guilt, by their Slackneſs in ſome or moſt Places; yet may it not be owing, in other Places, more to the Want of due Improvement in the People? But is it not hard to judge, whether this proceeds from the total Want of Grace, or the Want of the due Exerciſe or Excitation of it, eſpecially when Men are orderly? For had not <hi>the wiſe</hi> as well as <hi>the fooliſh Virgins</hi> their <hi>Slumbers?</hi> In what Age was it, wherein the Church enjoyed Liberty, Peace and Proſperity, for any Time, but the moſt faithful Miniſters had too much Reaſon to mourn in ſecret, becauſe of the Security and Unconcernedneſs of their Hearers? And how can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tell, but that this is the Caſe at preſent with many or moſt of his Brethren? Yea grant, that other Miniſters <hi>are not Succeſsful in fixing Terrors and Convictions</hi> to that Degree that Mr. <hi>W—d, T.</hi> and their Adherents fix them, or which they judge neceſſary as Preparative to Converſion; yet
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:004792_0036_100DEDDDD6172E90"/>
if the End of winning Souls to Chriſt, can be obtained with leſs Degrees, whether are thoſe high Degrees deſirable for them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves? May not therefore their Want of Succeſs in ſuch Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, be owing to their Faithfulneſs? <hi>viz.</hi> Becauſe they are not clear in Conſcience to uſe ſuch artful Ways to raiſe Men's Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions in a blind Way as others uſe, as judging, that God comes not in the Earthquake nor Whirlwind, but in the ſtill Voice, now as well as formerly. For is it not notorious, that they clear up Truths, and preach as convincingly, to the underſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Hearers, as the other Side, as well as more orthodoxly? And may we not further enquire, whether or no the ſolid Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes and Power of Religion do not ſeem to loſe Ground apace, by Men's crying up ſuch Awakenings in the Manner it is done? For do not Pride and Peeviſhneſs, Self-conceit and raſh Cenſures, Factions and Contentions, in many Places, ſeem to threaten to deſtroy the very Form of Religion and Goſpel Order? For tho' we own, that keeping up the Form is not enough to prove, that the Goſpel flouriſhes; yet, <hi>when hearing the Word, parta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king the Sacraments, and even paying the Salaries of Miniſters,</hi> are plain Goſpel Duties; and when done or performed in a be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coming Manner, are not theſe better Signs of the Succeſs of the Goſpel, than the Contempt and Neglect of theſe and other Duties, upon the Account of cauſeleſs Offences, groundleſs Jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſies, Factions and Party-Zeal, diviſive litigious Quarrels and diſorderly Rovings?</p>

Whereas Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſeems, in <hi>page</hi> 12. to explode the very Notion <hi>of a Miniſter's taking Comfort in his acting a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Part in doing his Duty, without ſeeing Succeſs:</hi> It muſt be owned, that to labour in vain, is double hard Labour; yet, it not the Succeſs of our Labours wholly and ſolely the Lord's, and not ours, how fit ſoever the Inſtrument be, as may be ſeen in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 7? And yet, did not God lay ſuch a Burthen, as <hi>la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring in vain,</hi> upon ſome of his very dear Servants, to their great Tryal and Exerciſe? And did not he tell ſome of them beforehand, that <hi>their Miniſtry would be ſucceſleſs;</hi> and was their Obedience and Faithfulneſs leſs or more glorious, in that they acted a good Part in Submiſſion to divine Authority, when they knew they ſhould have no Succeſs, or at leaſt no great one?

to comfort him, but that <hi>his Judgment was with the Lord, and his Work with his God?</hi> Iſa. xlix. 4. And doth not he comfort himſelf in his doing his Duty, even when he <hi>laboured in vain,</hi> when he ſaith in the next Verſe, <hi>Though</hi> Iſrael <hi>be not gathered, yet ſhall I be glorious in the Eyes of the Lord, and my God ſhall be my Strength?</hi> And hath not God given Grounds to his Servants, to comfort themſelves in their doing their Duty, as in <hi>Ezek.</hi> iii. 19, 21. and xxxiii. 9? And as to ourſelves, is not our acting a faithful Part, in the Way of Duty, the only ſolid Grounds of Comfort, in our ſeveral Callings and Works thereof, <hi>Gal.</hi> vi. 4? But as to Comfort in others, we readily grant, <hi>that a conſcientious Man, who travels in Birth that Chriſt may be formed in the Hearts of his Hearers, cannot take Comfort,</hi> without ſeeing probable Grounds of Hope of it, appearing in Men's Attachment to Truth in Principle and Practice; but if Miniſters, who are but Men at the beſt, cannot take Comfort in the Succeſs of their Labours <hi>without knowing</hi> or being aſſured, <hi>that Chriſt is truly formed in the Hearts of his Hearers,</hi> as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſeems to inſinuate here; how is it poſſible for Miniſters in an ordinary Way, to take Comfort in their Labours, while in this Life? Muſt not they therefore, according to this Rule, reſolve, while here, to ſow in Tears, without expecting to reap as much as the Firſt-fruits of Comfort in the Succeſs of their Labours, till the Time of reaping in Joy comes? For is not the Pretence of the certain Knowledge of the ſecret State of others in an or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Way, a vain Dream of an empty ſenſeleſs Brain?

But is it not the Truth in the Matter, that the Succeſs or real Efficacy of ſacred Adminiſtrations, depends wholly and ſolely upon the divine Bleſſing and Co-operation therewith? And if Men deſert the Truth in any Point, may it not be ſeen, that their great Capacities will only ſerve to entan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gle themſelves and others with vain Notions?</p>

May not a carnal Miniſter one Way or other make himſelf Maſter of the ſame Words and Phraſes, which Godly Miniſters uſe in ſpeaking of the higheſt Myſteries and Exerciſes of Grace, and of the moſt experimental Parts of Religion? As for Example, may not ſuch a Miniſter get, by Memory, Mr. <hi>J. T</hi>'s and Mr. <hi>Blair</hi>'s Sermons of <hi>Regeneration</hi> and <hi>Adoption:</hi> yea Mr. <hi>G.

And can any doubt, but that ſuch a Miniſter would be as care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and induſtrious this Way, as if he acted from better Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples? Beſides, hath not every Grace its Counterfeit? And are not theſe as like true Grace, that Men deceive themſelves with them, and others with their Luſtre; and when great Gifts are added to theſe, may not Men in the Strength thereof go very far in the Theory of the Doctrine of Experiences; and if they feel <hi>the leſs,</hi> may not they paſs with Men, if they have but Cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage to pretend <hi>the more?</hi> For doth not the Acceptance that the barefaced Pretence of Men's Ability to know and judge the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cret State of others, ſhew, that bold Pretenders may paſs with many for great and good Men?</p>

               <hi>Qu.</hi> VI. We would aſk Mr. <hi>T.</hi> further, whether he really judges, that the Truth of God delivered by a gifted, orthodox and regular Miniſter, tho' he were unconverted, have not a far greater Aptitude, as means to convince, convert and edify Hearers, than <hi>any Temptation of Satan, or any thing elſe that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duceth its Effect by meer Chance-Medley,</hi> as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is pleaſed to expreſs it <hi>page</hi> 13? 1 Becauſe the Ordinance is of Chriſt's Inſtitution. 2, The Power of God's Word, which is ſuppoſed to be ſpoken truly and decently. 3, Becauſe of the Prayers of the Godly Hearers. 4, The due Attention given to the Word as the Word of God. 5, Becauſe of the Prayers of the whole Church of God for a Bleſſing upon his own Ordinance. Will not theſe, together with other Circumſtances that may concur, make the good Effect following thereupon, an Effect of God's Bleſſing upon his own Inſtitution, and not of <hi>Chance-Medley,</hi> though Grace ſhould be wanting in the Preacher, which neither he nor the Hearer knows, nor ſuſpects? Is God's Power, Grace or Holineſs any Way leſs glorious, if God owns his own Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances, regularly adminiſtred, as to the external Part of it, to do a ſaving Good to the Hearer, when the Preacher, for Want of Grace, receives no ſaving Benefit thereby? Doth not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſeem to allow, that <hi>ſome Inſtances could be ſhewn of unconverted Miniſters being inſtrumental in convincing Perſons of their loſt State,</hi> i. e. effectually, as we underſtand him, or elſe, can any ſuppoſe it <hi>a rare Thing</hi> for them to convince Men in ſome De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of their fallen State? Can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> give any one Inſtance of a Perſon effectually convinced of his loſt State by <hi>Satan</hi>'s Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations? For are not all <hi>Satan</hi>'s Temptations, even thoſe that he tranſacts as an Angel of Light, blinding and not enlightning?
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:004792_0038_100DEDE152551D80"/>
It is true, God may over-rule Evil, ſo as to bring Good out of it, but can that Good in any Senſe be ſaid to be the Effect of the Evil, or is it not the ſole Effect of ſome good Cauſe? Is there the ſame Ground to think, that God will make uſe of Satan, who hath no Right nor Call to uſe any one of God's Ordinances, as often as he doth a natural Man, well gifted and regularly called, according to God's Inſtitution, making Uſe of his own Ordinance in Obedience to him, to convince, convert and edify Souls? Doth not God beſtow Gifts on natural Men, either for their own Good, or for the Good of others; or elſe, muſt it not be, that he beſtows them in vain? Is there any Ground in all the Book of God for Men to think, that God will own Satan as an Inſtrument of conveying any ſaving Bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to the Souls of Men? If there is, had not Men better to wait upon him, than upon an enthuſiaſtick Dreamer's Miniſtry; for doth not that Text in <hi>Jer.</hi> xxiii. 32. plainly aſſure us, that ſuch <hi>ſhall not profit God's</hi> Iſrael <hi>at all,</hi> be their <hi>Dreams</hi> never ſo pleaſing to Fleſh and Blood? We grant, that God may make Uſe of Satan, to chaſtize and afflict the Bodies and Minds of Perſons, for doth not Scripture and later Experience prove this? But who can prove, that God hath made uſe of him to ſubdue any Sin? It is granted, that the Body may be mortified by Satan; but is it not the proper Work of God's Spirit to mortify the Deeds of the Body? Is it therefore ſuppoſable, that God will make Satan inſtrumental of conveying any ſaving Good to Souls by his wicked Temptations, in all which he rebels againſt God and ſeeks the Ruin of Souls? If Men will once ſwallow this wicked Suggeſtion, may not they as well believe, that wicked Men, who are Satan's Inſtruments, may, by their Temp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, convince Perſons too, and conſequently that they may do at leaſt as much Good to Souls by ſerving the Devil as ever they can do by ſerving God, ſeeing there is no more than a <hi>Chance-Medley</hi> in both? Is it not one of the moſt unjuſt and wicked Cenſures of the Age, to rank all natural Men with Phariſees, in order to condemn the Body of the Clergy of this Generation for natural Men and Phariſees; and, as if this was too little, to rank them with Devils, in order to raiſe Prejudices againſt them, to the marring of the Succeſs of the Goſpel and the Good of Souls, by their Miniſtry, as far as ſuch wicked Inſinuations can prevail? How much of the Phariſee Mr. <hi>T.</hi> acts herein; yea, how much he hath rejoiced the Devils in Hell by ſuch
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:004792_0038_100DEDE152551D80"/>
Cenſures, we leave him, at a calm Hour, to conſider. In the mean Time we recommend to his Conſideration, what is written in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 1—3. Could any Thing but raſh Anger and Party-Zeal, or worſe, inſpire a Miniſter of Chriſt, to take ſo much of the Devil's Part againſt orthodox and orderly Miniſters, and the regular Exerciſes of Religion, upon blind (and for aught appears, or for aught he or any of his Party knows) falſe Gueſſes of their carnal State, as to many of them? Should not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> conſider, whether or no what Chriſt told his Diſciples, in <hi>Luke</hi> ix. 55. be not very applicable to him on this Account?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> VII. Is not reading of Scripture an Ordinance of God's Appointment, enjoined upon natural as well as ſpiritual Men, for Conviction, Converſion and Edification; and is there not a Bleſſing pronounced upon him that readeth, in <hi>Rev.</hi> i. 3? We would therefore aſk Mr. <hi>T.</hi> are not there ſome natural Men convinced and converted by reading the Scripture? If ſo, can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> give us any Reaſon, why a gifted natural Man's preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Word, convincingly and clearly, ſhould be leſs efficacious to convince and convert others, than a natural Man's own reading the Word, when the latter may be more ignorant than the former? Or will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tell us, that Conviction or Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion by reading the Scriptures is an Effect of <hi>Chance-Medley</hi> too, in order to perſuade People to caſt away their Bibles, or the read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them, with or after their old Paſtors, that they may ſeek the Law wholly at the Mouth of the Prieſts, for the Prieſts Lips ſhould keep Knowledge? But by Experience, by the Help of their Bibles, may not People know that they may utter Dreams? Well, is not it ſome Comfort to the old Miniſters, that they are not contemned, but where the Truth and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances of God are ſlighted, and juvenile Inventions, having hoary Periwigs clapt on their Heads to make them look Grave, are admired? For when the former regain their loſt Credit, and the latter, by their being well viewed, loſe it, may not they ſtand a fair Chance of being accounted honeſt Men again, for all this empty Noiſe?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi>'s fourth Argument to prove, that the People <hi>are to be pitied,</hi> &amp;c. Becauſe <hi>the Miniſtry of natural Men is dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous, both in reſpect of the Doctrines and Practice of Piety. The Doctrines of</hi> Original Sin, Juſtification by Faith alone, <hi>and the other Points of</hi> Calviniſm, <hi>are very croſs to the Grain of unrenew'd Nature.

Hopes of Preferment, may have the Edge of their natural Enmity againſt them blunted; yet it's far from being broken or removed: It is only the ſaving Grace of God, that can give us a true Reliſh for thoſe Nature-humbling Doctrines; and ſo effectually ſecure us from being infected by the contrary. Is not the Carnality of the Miniſtry, one great Cauſe of the general Spread of</hi> Arminianiſm, Socinianiſm, Arianiſm <hi>and</hi> Deiſm, <hi>at this Day through the World?</hi>

For if Mr. <hi>Tennent</hi> ſtands to what he ſays here, doth not it amount at leaſt to thus much, That a firm Attachment to the nature-humbling Doctrines of <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> is a good or at leaſt a probable Sign of the gracious State of the Perſon thus attached? If ſo, muſt not the Body of our Synod, while <hi>Calviniſts,</hi> paſs for gracious Men?

Will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> engage for himſelf and his Party, if we engage for the other Side, to refer the Debate about carnal Men to be fairly determined, as Men can be proven to ſtand attached to <hi>Calviniſm,</hi> or infected by what is contrary?

               <hi>Qu.</hi> II. Is not Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s ſecond Anſwer as weak and of as little Force as the former? We muſt own, that we do not well underſtand what it is that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> means, by ſaying, That <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das's Miniſtry was extraordinary neceſſary, in order to fulfil anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Prophecies concerning him:</hi> is not there ſomething leſs or ſomething more than the Truth here? However, That <hi>Judas his Miniſtry was extraordinary,</hi> is readily granted; but yet, can any imagine, but that Grace was as neceſſary to fulfil an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Office as to fulfil an ordinary one? But will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tells us, what <hi>extraordinary Neceſſity</hi> was there of fulfilling the <hi>Prophecies</hi> concerning <hi>Judas his Miniſtry,</hi> more than for the fulfilling of all other Divine Prophecies, as for Inſtance, the Prophecy concerning the Coming of the <hi>grievous Wolves</hi> into the Church of <hi>Epheſus,</hi> concerning the Coming of <hi>Anti-Chriſt,</hi> and of <hi>falſe Chriſts,</hi> and of the Perillouſneſs of the latter Days, becauſe of the falſe Teachers and the Degeneracy of Profeſſors? Was the Miniſtry of <hi>Judas</hi> any more neceſſary to fulfil Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies, than the Miniſtry of the Aſſes Colt to carry Chriſt to <hi>Jeruſalem?</hi> For was it not as neceſſary, that the Prophecy in <hi>Zech.</hi> ix. 9. concerning this, ſhould be fulfilled, as any Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies concerning <hi>Judas? Matth.</hi> xxi. 4, 5. Beſides, was there any Neceſſity, that God ſhould make any Prophecies con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning <hi>Judas</hi>'s Miniſtry; but only God's <hi>good Will and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure</hi> to order Matters ſo? And if there was any or the leaſt Inconſiſtency with God's holy Perfections or his revealed Will, in his giving a Call to an unconverted <hi>Judas,</hi> under the <hi>New-Teſtament</hi> Diſpenſation; might not God eaſily have prevented that neceſſity, by decreeing and propheſying in another Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner? And even after this Propheſy was made, was not there as great Neceſſity to fulfil every other divine Propheſy, when ones made, as there was to fulfil the Propheſies concerning <hi>Judas?</hi> For did not God's Truth, Faithfulneſs and Immutableneſs, bind him to fulfil all, as much as any one of his Prophecies? Where
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:004792_0041_100DEDE839E486B0"/>
then is there Room for this extraordinary Neceſſity to take Place? Is not this a falſe and an empty Sound as well as the former?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> III. As for the <hi>Abuſe made of the Inſtance of</hi> Judas's <hi>Miniſtry,</hi> let thoſe that are guilty look to that, we are only for getting what Light and Inſtruction that Part of Scripture affords us; for is not that wrote for our Inſtruction, as well as the reſt of our Bibles? But as for <hi>Halters,</hi> if they were not thrown in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> Way, might not we well let them alone, as what no way (as we know of) belong to either Side in this Controverſy, <hi>to feel</hi> or to handle? For whatever Evil may be ſuppoſed to be in Men's different Apprehenſions in religious Matters, or even in Men's different States, as to Grace, hath not God and Man judged Halters unfit Engines for zealous Kirk-men among Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſtants to handle? And can there be any Room to fear, that they ſhall be entruſted in ſuch Hands, but where Lord Inquiſitors are firſt choſen to make Inquiſition into, and Diſcoveries of the unknown Land of Conſcience? Till therefore we hear Rumours of the one, what need Proteſtants be afraid of the other? But ſeeing ſuch Tools are good for nothing but to break the Neck, and not to convince the Judgment; have not we Reaſon to bleſs God for wiſe Rulers and an equitable Conſtitution, which adjudge them to proper Perſons and Crimes? And is it not the Duty of all Chriſtians, earneſtly to pray, that God may in Mercy preſerve Men from ſuch a Degree of Deſpair, and all the native Cauſes of it, as may drive Men into Halters undeſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vedly, as well as from ſuch Practices as may juſtly deſerve them? Let none ſay, that this is the laſt Shift of legal Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing.</p>
            <p>In <hi>page</hi> 15. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> endeavours to take off the Force of ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Objection, taken from <hi>Paul</hi>'s <hi>rejoycing at the Goſpel's being preached by ſome, out of Envy and Contention, and not ſincerely,</hi> Phil. 1.</p>

Is not Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Anſwer ſo weak and feeble, that one night juſtly think, that his Cauſe would have appeared every whit as good and ſtrong, if he had not at all meddled with the Objection, unleſs it be with thoſe, who are diſpoſed to take every Thing Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſays and writes, upon an <hi>implicite Faith?</hi> For though it be allowed, that the Apoſtle was well verſed in <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

but a ſmall Matter to be judged by Man's Judgment; yet, as his Character ſubſerved the Credit of the Goſpel, was not he a zealous Maintainer and Defender of it, in Oppoſition to the falſe Apoſtles, who endeavoured to raiſe their own by vain-glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Boaſtings, and to blacken and eclipſe the Apoſtle's Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, by Clamours and Miſrepreſentations, as knowing that they could not overturn his Cauſe, unleſs firſt they could wound his Character, no more than the Phariſees could Chriſt's? Can any unbyaſſed Reader think, but that the Apoſtle's Joy or Rejoycing, there ſpoken of, was upon the Account of the Preaching of Chriſt, as a Saviour, to loſt Sinners, when he plainly ſays, <hi>What then? notwithſtanding every Way, whether in Pretence, or in Truth, Chriſt is preached; and I therein do rejoice, yea, and I will rejoice?</hi> Where have we in the Text the leaſt Grounds for the idle Gloſſes Mr. <hi>T.</hi> makes here, intimating that the Apoſtle's <hi>Joy or Rejoicing</hi> was upon the Account that ſuch Preaching as is aforeſaid, gave him an Opportunity <hi>to exerciſe Self Denial,</hi> or ſhould be a Means to promote his <hi>ſpiritual Progreſs in Goodneſs,</hi> and <hi>perhaps prove a Mean to procure his temporal Freedom?</hi> Was not giving Way to the like fertile Invention, in gloſſing upon Scripture the very Method by which Phariſee Doctors formed their <hi>Gemara</hi> upon their <hi>Miſnah,</hi> and of both framed their <hi>Tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mud,</hi> whereby they at laſt quite evacuated Scripture of its proper Senſe?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> II. Doth not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> here plainly give up the Cauſe, and allow the Objection its full Force, when he ſays, <hi>the Apoſtle would rather, that Chriſt ſhould be preached out of Envy, than not at all; becauſe their Preaching might be a Means of curing the groſs Ignorance of Goſpel Doctrine reigning in that Age?</hi> Doth not he here ſeem to make a fair Conceſſion, that uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted Miniſters might do good to Souls, by turning them from Darkneſs to Light, and why not, <hi>from the Power of Satan unto God?</hi> For ſeeing, as the ſame Apoſtle notes elſewhere, that <hi>unſanctified Knowledge puffeth up, but edifieth not,</hi> as in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> viii. 1. How could he, agreeable to his own Doctrine, <hi>rejoice</hi> at ſuch Preaching, if he did not believe, that the Knowledge conveyed thereby might be ſanctified? We entirely agree with Mr. <hi>T.</hi> that the Apoſtle's <hi>Joy</hi> was a <hi>comparative Joy,</hi> for how could any knowing Objector dream, that the Apoſtle ſhould rejoice as much at ſuch Preaching, as if it was done ſincerely? Seeing therefore Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſeems to grant the main Thing con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:004792_0042_100DEDEABA36D8E8"/>
for, in this Objection, doth not it appear needleſs, to follow him in his conjectural Gloſſes any further? For do not the Apoſtle's Words plainly import thus much at leaſt, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Preaching of Chriſt and the Goſpel in Purity, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever Men's ſecret Deſigns be therein, good or bad, yet the Work done, affords Matter of Joy to the pious Soul? Will Men then conſider, what Sort of a Spirit ſways ſuch, who en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to ſuppreſs orthodox Preaching of the Goſpel, upon meer Gueſſes of the Preacher's unconverted State, if not the Spirit of Envy?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s third doctrinal Query, is, <hi>How Pity ſhould be ſhewn, on this mournful Occaſion, to the World, now groaning under the intolerable Burthen of unconverted Miniſters:</hi> And his Anſwer is,</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>By mourning for and ſympathizing with them, with compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate Tenderneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> I. Was it not a pretty Piece of <hi>Machiavelian Policy</hi> in wicked <hi>Jezebel,</hi> to proclaim a Faſt to mourn for <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Sin, when the Eye-ſore was <hi>Naboth</hi>'s Vineyard; which could not be procured for Money, and therefore muſt be purchaſed at the vaſt Expence of falſe Swearing and cruel Murder, coloured over with the Paint of a religious Faſt? And who better pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared for ſuch a Faſt as was deſigned, than an <hi>Ahab,</hi> that was ſick and bedrid with Diſcontent? Is not mournful moaning of a Child that hath got a Fall, the ready Way to make him cry heartily, tho' he is not hurt?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s ſecond Anſwer, is, <hi>That this Pity is to be ſhewn, by praying for them with Earneſtneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> I. When <hi>like People, like Prieſt,</hi> is an old Scripture Phraſe, how comes it to paſs, that in this Age, the Crowds of the People in moſt Places are exceeding Godly, but the Body of the Clergy exceeding carnal? When there is ſuch Talk of tender Pity and earneſt Prayer for the godly People, as being in a poor melancholy State, is it not a little ſtrange, that there is not a Word of Pity, nor of Prayer, for the unconverted Miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, who are ſuppoſed to be in a much poorer State, neither in this Inſtruction, nor in the whole Sermon? Are they ſo far gone, that they are unfit to be prayed for, or to have a little Room in ſome Corner of the new Kalender; Is the Prayer that <hi>they may be converted, or detected, or confounded,</hi> which ſome uſe, a Piece of Supererogation? Are not orthodox, regular
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:004792_0043_100DEDECF4FE1210"/>
Miniſters as fit to be prayed for, as an heterodox diſorderly Iti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerant? Is it not a little ſtrange, that when he was directing to pray for a Bleſſing upon the <hi>dry Morſels,</hi> got in dry Paſtures, and from dry Nurſes, that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> did not think it proper, to direct Men to pray for Heaven's Bleſſing or Influence, to increaſe the Graſs of the one, and the Milk of the other? If Mr. <hi>T.</hi> rightly applies that Text in <hi>Jer.</hi> xxiii. 32. to the proper Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons, when it is expreſly ſaid, that thoſe there intended ſhould not at all profit God's <hi>Iſrael,</hi> how can ſuch a Prayer for <hi>ſanc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifying and ſweetning their dry Morſels</hi> be made in Faith? Doth not Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s preſſing Men to pray as aforeſaid, imply, that he hath ſome Hopes, that ſuch Prayers of the Godly may conduce to render ſuch Preaching ſucceſsful; and is not this more Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of Charity, than ſeems to be reconcileable to his Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions elſewhere? For if there be any Grounds at all for the Soul to reſt in Hope, in the Uſe of ſuch Prayers, muſt not there be ſome greater Probability of obtaining the Bleſſing prayed for, than a meer <hi>Chance-Medley?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. In <hi>pag.</hi> 16. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> goes on to a third Direction, how to ſhew Pity in this ſorrowful Caſe, and that is, <hi>by liberal Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>butions to encourage private Schools and Seminaries of Learning, which are under the Care of ſkilful and experienced Chriſtians, in order to educate Youth for the Miniſtry.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The Motion, for aught we know, is very good, and if Congregations in general would contribute a little that way, may it not be of ſome Conſequence, for an after Supply? Only we would deſire to know, how ſuch a Deſign can be carried on better for the common Intereſt, than by putting ſuch a School under the Care and Inſpection of the Synod? But yet, tho' we would not be ſo far miſinterpreted, as if we ſpoke any thing againſt encouraging ſuch Schools, for we believe it a very good Motion; yet is it not obſervable, that when Mr. <hi>T.</hi> makes ſuch Out-cries againſt Hirelings, yet he himſelf expects ſome Fruit from Goſpel-Hearers, <hi>more than cheap Prayers,</hi> when it would ſeem, that he judges it too great a Favour for ſuch Miniſters, whoſe hard Lot it is to be accounted unconverted upon Gueſſes, to have a Share of <hi>People's cheap Prayers;</hi> albeit it is well known, that the Miniſters thus abuſed, at leaſt many of them, have had their great Share in planting and watering thoſe very Congregations, in which upſtart Innovators now ſo much crow over them? We would further aſk, Whether the unpecedented
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:004792_0043_100DEDECF4FE1210"/>
Strictneſs in the Admiſſion of Scholars; which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> preſcribes here, <hi>viz.</hi> That none ſhould be admitted into ſuch Schools, <hi>but ſuch as have plain Evidences of experimental Religion,</hi> be approve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able or unreaſonable? Would it not be ſoon enough to require this of a Candidate, when he enters upon Trials? Or might not Godly Tutors be probable Inſtruments of Converſion in the Youth under their Care? And doth not Experience tell us, that Youth under Tutorage have ſtrangely altered, ſome for the Better, and ſome for the Worſe? But Mr. <hi>T.</hi> inſinuates, that he had ſome Apprehenſions, that <hi>the Phariſees would be againſt ſuch a Propoſal;</hi> if he intends by Phariſees, the Miniſters of our Synod, who are at ſome Variance with him, for who elſe can be thought to concern themſelves with our Schools; might not he know the Contrary by the Motion that was on Foot laſt Year in our Synod, for ſuch a School to be erected among us, under the Care and Inſpection of the Synod? And if Mr. <hi>T.</hi> intends the Miniſters of our Synod in another Inſinuation, <hi>viz.</hi> his ſaying, <hi>if they could help it, they would not let one faithful Man come into the Miniſtry;</hi> and when it is notorious, that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> never had any Debates with any others but the Synod about Admiſſions of Men into the Miniſtry; and when there is a Debate on this Head depending between him and the Synod; how can any underſtand them of any other? Did any pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing the Chriſtian Religion among the Non-Conformiſts, ſhew themſelves ſo bare-facedly void of Charity and more cruel in raſh Judging than Mr. <hi>T.</hi> does appear in theſe Words? Is it not hard for his Brethren, that are thus abuſed, to entertain a favourable Opinion of his Chriſtianity, who appears ſo mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrouſly void of Truth and Charity, as theſe Words import? For can their very worſt Enemies, if they have any ſuch, ſay that they ever admitted any into the Miniſtry, but ſuch as had at the Time of their Admiſſion, a good Appearance of Piety? And if it happened afterwards, that any ſuch diſcovered any Unſoundneſs in Doctrine or Irregularity in Practice, have not his Brethren acted as faithful a Part in bearing Witneſs againſt ſuch in a Way of regular Diſcipline, as ever he or any of his Party did? Tho' 'tis probable, they did not publickly libel them, in a blind Way, nor make diſorderly publick general Exclamations againſt them, after the new Mode, which we judge uncivil as well as unchriſtian, as being contradictory to Reaſon and the Rules of Scripture-Diſcipline, which teacheth
<pb n="86" facs="unknown:004792_0044_100DEDEE9DC60E18"/>
us that all Authority and Church Power is given for Edification, and not for Deſtruction, as it is written in 2 <hi>C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>.</hi> 10.8. and 13.10. For how can any Set of Men clear themſelves or ſatisfy others, when wrongly traduced in ſuch a blind Anti-Chriſtian Way? And do not ſuch as uſe ſuch Methods, copy more after the Phariſees in aſperſing Chriſt and his true Followers, or after <hi>Ovid,</hi> who in his Rage curſed <hi>Caeſar</hi> under the feigned Name of <hi>Ibis,</hi> than after Chriſt, who tho' tis true, reproved both the <hi>Phariſees</hi> and <hi>Sadducees</hi> ſharply, yet were not thoſe Names the diſtinguiſhing Characters of particular Sects, known by their diſtinguiſhing Principles and Practices, among whom he lived? And doth not he always point out ſome particular falſe Doctrine or Male-practice, which he reproved them for? How contrary then to his Practice are Men's dark Inſinuations, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proaches and blind Puſhes made at the Characters of ſome Miniſters, under the Umbrage of crying againſt Phariſee-Teachers and carnal Miniſters? For if ſome of our Miniſters be not intended, why is this Noiſe made now in a Time of ſome Variance in our Congregations, to raiſe groundleſs Jealouſies and Suſpicions? And if ſome of them be intended, why are not they proſecuted in a Way of regular Diſcipline? For how elſe can ſuch Exclaimers clear their own Conſciences towards ſuch, or convince their Hearers of their Integrity, or direct them in rejecting unworthy Miniſters, if ſuch there be among us? For if Hearers go to act herein by blind Gueſſes upon general Out-cries againſt we know not whom, nor for what, will it not be ſomething worſe than their acting upon an implicit Faith? But to return to the Matter in Hand; if it be enquired, where theſe private Schools or Academies might be had, and who are the Maſters? Altho' Mr. <hi>T.</hi> doth not particularly point them out in his Sermon, yet if we compare what is here ſaid, wiſh what Mr. <hi>T.</hi> (as we are informed) declared publickly in the laſt Synod, will it not put the Matter in clearer Light? For was it not remarkable, that when the Synod was cognoſcing upon the Propoſal then under Conſideration, concerning erecting a publick School to train up Men for the Miniſtry, that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> openly diſapproved ſaid Propoſal? And was not the Reaſon he then gave of his Diſapprovement, becauſe he believed ſaid Propoſal was levelled againſt his Father's School? Will not this, together with ſome concurring Circumſtances of the ſame Nature, which we may declare if Need be, afford us a probable Commentary
<pb n="87" facs="unknown:004792_0044_100DEDEE9DC60E18"/>
upon this Direction of Mr. <hi>T.?</hi> So that tho' he ſpeaks of private Schools in the plural Number; yet doth not it ſeem likely, that his Father's School is the only One he wants to be encouraged with liberal Contributions? And if ſo, what is the Meaning of that ſolemn Epiphonema or Exclamation, <hi>Who is upon God's Side? Who?</hi> but this, Who will contribute to my Father's School? Who?</p>
            <p>It were endleſs to follow Mr. <hi>T.</hi> in all his blind Puſhes; but will he tell us, what he means by <hi>the Kingdom and Credit, which the Phariſees are wont to be ſcared about?</hi> When both his Partizans as well as we underſtand, that this is levelled againſt ſome of our Miniſters, we cannot but think that we make a nearer Gueſs of the Perſons aimed at in thoſe Words, than is made of Men's carnal and gracious State oft by thoſe that make high Pretences of being ſpiritual Men, or elſe let Mr. <hi>T.</hi> confute us. We would therefore aſk, Hath Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ever heard any of our whole Party uttering the leaſt Mum in the Behalf of the Title of any King in our Dominions, but King JESUS and King <hi>George,</hi> ever ſince the latter came to the Throne? Muſt not this be a blind Puſh to blacken Men's Credit, or elſe a <hi>ſly and ſneaking Method to ſecure the Favour of Grandees or Applauſe of the People to a Party?</hi> Or muſt it not be to incenſe them againſt others, Phariſee-like, who ſaid to <hi>Pilate, Thou art not</hi> Caeſar<hi>'s Friend, if thou let this Man go; Whoſoever maketh him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf King, ſpeaketh againſt</hi> Caeſar? But tho' we are confident our wiſe and good Rulers underſtand our Conſtitution better, than to be incenſed againſt any Man upon meer Slanders and falſe Surmiſes, eſpecially when they conſider there are ſome Out-cries made againſt the Chriſtianity of ſome Civil as well as Eccleſiaſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Rulers, by ſome of the ſame Catholick Knot, who in ſpight of Right and Truth, would take from all others that differ from them the very Name of true Chriſtianity, by miſcalling them carnal Men and Phariſees; yet doth not Experience prove, that any vain and falſe Out-cry may do Wonders with the giddy Multitude, to drive them into Diſorders? But if Truth be told, who are thoſe among us who ſeem to meddle with State Affairs more than thoſe who in a blind Zeal make ſome faint Eſſays, in ſome Sermons, to revive the Debates about the ſolemn League and Covenant? But ſuppoſe a Knot of Gentlemen, by their Libels, Reproaches, diſorderly Exclamations and Miſrepreſenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Miniſters, have brought their Credit as low as they can

wiſh in the Books of their warm Admirers, as well as advanced their own high, by their vain-glorious Boaſtings and Noiſe of Catholiciſm, and of Zeal for Reformation, <hi>&amp;c,</hi> is it Chriſtian-like or Gentleman-like to triumph over thoſe that are down? For beſides that the Wheel always goes round, hath not every Leaf two Sides, and every Controverſy two Parties? May not their Credit be as high in the Books of their Party, as Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s is in thoſe of his Party? And if Mr. <hi>T.</hi> does not take better Care to look what he preaches and writes than he ſeems to have done in this, may not there be Danger, that the Wheel will turn faſter to its proper Place than it was forced out of it? But why ſhould Men fight for a Bundle of Straw? Did not he that of all Men had the beſt Claim to a good Name, an high Credit, and a glorious Reputation, know what it was one Day to hear the Multitude crying, <hi>Hoſanna to the Son of David,</hi> ſhortly after hear the Multitudes in the ſame City crying out, <hi>Crucify him,</hi> with as much Fervency? Was not <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Barnabas,</hi> as we read in <hi>Acts</hi> 14. in Danger of being Deified? And yet, when deſigning Jews, it may be of the Sect of the Phariſees, came to <hi>Lyſtra</hi> and miſrepreſented the Apoſtles, was not their Credit ſo low, that <hi>Paul</hi> was ſtoned and dragged out of the City? Here were two Converſions, and Men were very zealous in both; and would not Men do well to conſider, whether we have not many like them? But was it not good Advice, whoever gave it, <hi>He that wiſhes well to his own due Praiſes, let him never deſire they ſhould be yoked with another's unjuſt Reproaches, leſt the Hearer, knowing the one unrighteouſly ſlandered, conclude that the other is as unjuſtly flattered; For is it not an unqueſtionable Maxim, that he that will be a Sycophant againſt one, will be a Paraſite to another?</hi> And ſhould not Men that have great Credit, of all others, take heed how they improve it?</p>

Word, forſooth, for Preaching, to help the little Credit of the Clergy) <hi>more orthodoxly about the New-Birth, than their Prede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſor</hi> Nicodemus? And if by theſe latter be not intended the Body of the Miniſters of our Synod, why do Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s own Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tizans interpret the Matter ſo, as if they were the Perſons here pointed out? For will any tell us, where we, at ſuch a Diſtance from Mr. <hi>T.</hi> himſelf, can learn the true Meaning of ſuch Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions better, than from the declared near Gueſſes of ſuch as call themſelves ſpiritual Men? For is it not probable, that they might hear more of the Matter in the <hi>Conclave</hi> than is told in the Publick? And have not ſome of our Miniſters, that are both orthodox and regular, been proclaimed <hi>carnal Men and Hypocrites,</hi> more publickly, without any juſt Charge tabled againſt them, that deſerved a juſt Reproof, much leſs ſuch a mercileſs Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure? Is all this no Grounds to appear againſt ſuch baſe Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cries to raiſe unjuſt Prejudices, albeit, Men have no Conſciouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Guilt in the Matter? If therefore Mr. <hi>T.</hi> can prove any Articles of Charge, of any Weight, againſt any of his Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren, why doth not he appear againſt them in the Way of regular Diſcipline, ſo that they may be rejected, if they deſerve it? And have not <hi>Meſſrs. T.</hi> and <hi>B—r</hi> been deſired to do this in our Preſbytery, and yet refuſed to comply? What will <hi>Mr. T.</hi> think of a late Writer, who ſays, <hi>It was an hateful Spirit in</hi> Cain, <hi>the Companion of a bloody Principle, that made him ſay,</hi> Am I my Brother's Keeper? <hi>And we do generally find that Perſon, who is backward to be his Brother's Keeper in an evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical, forward enough to be his Murderer in a moral Conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation: but let Brotherly Love continue.</hi> But to trace the Matter a little further, 1, One Branch of the heavy Charge againſt the Clergy, is, <hi>That Swarms of Locuſts, Crowds of Phariſees, have as covetouſly as cruelly, crept into the Miniſtry, in this adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terous Generation! who as nearly reſemble the Character given of the old Phariſees, in the Doctrinal Part of this Diſcourſe, as me Crow's Egg does another.</hi> And to ſtrike Home, this is ſaid <hi>to be the Caſe of the Body of the Clergy of this Generation.</hi> Hear your Charge, your heavy Charge, O ye Clergy! Come to the Bar, anſwer to your Indictment, or elſe, muſt not you be damn'd at once? For is it not Part of the new Mode of Preaching, when ſome Men come acroſs the Word <hi>Condemned</hi> in a Scripture Text, to chuſe to read it <hi>damm'd;</hi> whether becauſe this Mode is leſs Scriptural, or becauſe they would
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:004792_0046_100DEB6D058BF7B8"/>
conform to the uſual Dialect of roaring Boys; let them anſwer that? If the Attorney for the Defendant, Judge, or Jury, call for the Evidence, to prove this heavy Charge, is not the main and only Evidence this, <hi>They are blind, who do not ſee this to be the Caſe!</hi> There is your Charge, and there is your Evidence, and if Judge or Jury be ſo ſaucy as to deſire more Clearneſs in the Matter before they pronounce Judgment, let them know their Doom beforehand; for is it not paſt all Doubt, that, by the laſt rehearſed Clauſe, they are damn'd for <hi>blind Men</hi> already, if they offer to demur in the Caſe? Are not theſe <hi>big Words</hi> and <hi>bold Say-ſoes,</hi> uttered with that Confidence, which bad Men commonly aſſume, that would be believed in an unproved Falſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hood? Is not this a brave ready Way to conjure down any Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troverſy at once, and to blow up the Caſtle of the Credit of the <hi>whole Body of the Clergy</hi> with a ſingle Puff of vain corrupt Breath? Let none aſk, is this powerful Preaching? For is it not all Thunder, without the leaſt Flaſh of Lightning? And what is the Sum of it but this, <hi>I know it, I believe it, I aſſert it, and I will ſtand to it, and I will damn him that will ſay, Nay?</hi> But then, if any one ſhould ſay, in the Behalf of the Clergy with their ſtorm-beaten Credit, are not many of them orthodox, and for aught that is proven againſt them, live regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly? And doth not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> in the Doctrinal Part, own, <hi>That nothing but the Grace of God, can give Men a true Reliſh of the Nature-humbling Doctrines of</hi> Calviniſm, <hi>and effectually ſecure them from being infected by the contrary?</hi> What will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> then ſay to thoſe, who are of a longer Standing than himſelf in the Miniſtry, and yet ſeem fully as well, if not better at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tached to theſe Doctrines, than he and his Party ſeem to be of late? Can this ward off the Blow? No, no: For have not we a. 2d. Branch of the Charge, which ſhall do the Execution of blowing up all ſuch Pleas? behold! it comes, <hi>It is true, ſome of the modern Phariſees have learnt to prate a little more ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doxly, about the New-Birth, than their Predeceſſor</hi> Nicodemus, <hi>who are, in the mean time, as great Strangers to the feeling Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perience of it, as he.</hi> Surely! Do not theſe Men feel well, who feel for themſelves and all the World beſides? But how ſhall we ſteer now, for are not we gone into ſome Latitude beyond the <hi>Thirty-two</hi> Points of the Seaman's Compaſs? And ſo, is not the Matter paſt Trial, at the Bar of Man, or even of Angels? For when <hi>Men prate orthodoxly,</hi> tho' they were ſuch Bunglers
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:004792_0046_100DEB6D058BF7B8"/>
as not to be able to preach, how can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> prove, that <hi>they are as great Strangers to the feeling Experiences of the New-Birth, as</hi> Nicodemus, or even, that they are greater Strangers to it than himſelf, ſeeing it is no falſe Latin to ſay, that <hi>he cannot ſearch the Heart?</hi> And on the other Hand, how can the Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy prove their feeling Experiences, when it is a Maxim in Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine, as well as human Law, that <hi>no Man</hi> is a proper Evidence in his <hi>own Caſe?</hi> Unleſs therefore Mr. <hi>T.</hi> can prove, that he ſees other Men's <hi>inward Feelings,</hi> and that they are heterodox, when their Words are orthodox, muſt not he be nonſuited in all our lower Courts, and conſequently muſt not the Trial be adjourned to the great Aſſizes, at King Jeſus's Bench, at once, unleſs ſome can be ſo happy, as to produce authentick Commiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, under the Broad Seal, to conſtitute them general Vicars, to judge the Secrets of other Men, by <hi>Feelings?</hi> Indeed, it muſt be owned, that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath acted a dexterous Part, in painting the Phariſee with two oppoſite Faces, under one Hood, ſo that if Men are <hi>orthodox, letter-learned and regular, or the contrary,</hi> they ſtill anſwer <hi>the Character given to the Phariſee;</hi> and muſt not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> have ſome cunning Art, beyond what is common to Man, if he can paint his own Face, ſo that it will not an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer either of the Phariſees Faces, and be a good Man too? But if the News be true, that Phariſees are now become ortho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dox and regular, let alone their letter-learning, we would aſk, whether ſuch Phariſees ought not to paſs, with Men, for brighter Chriſtians than Mr. <hi>W.</hi> or <hi>T.</hi> or their Adherents, until they reject openly Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s falſe Scheme, as well as the falſe Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity contained in this Sermon, together with their late anarchi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Tenets and Practices, which are inconſiſtent with Truth and Goſpel-Order? And ſeeing the <hi>New-Birth</hi> is the only Point here touched, will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tell us, who of our Miniſters of the other Side, appear to <hi>grope</hi> ſo much <hi>in the Dark</hi> about the Doctrine of it, as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> ſeems to do, when one while he makes it <hi>a ſpiritual Conception of Chriſt, as the Seed of the Wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, in the Hearts of Believers?</hi> And another while, doth not he ſeem to make it the Work of the Miniſter, to regenerate thoſe that are baptized by him, by aſſerting, that <hi>Chriſt gave a Commiſſion to his Apoſtles, and their Succeſſors in the Miniſtry, to baptize Men into the Nature of the Holy Trinity?</hi> Another while, doth not he ſeem to make it <hi>Man's own Work,</hi> when he preſſes Men, as ſunk into <hi>the Nature of the Beaſt and the
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:004792_0047_100DEDF4985C5BD0"/>
Devil, to believe in Chriſt, in order to receive the quickening or ſanctifying Spirit?</hi> How will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> prove, that this Man <hi>ſeek</hi> well, when it appears to ordinary Capacities, he doth not ſpeak well in this, and <hi>many other</hi> weighty Points of Doctrine? Will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> name us that orthodox pious Writer, that is guilty of ſuch a monſtrous Degree of Uncharitableneſs and raſh Judging, as ſeems to be couched in thoſe Charges againſt the <hi>Body of the Clergy of this Generation,</hi> when he thus unmercifully and groundleſly draws his Cenſures thro' <hi>their Hearts,</hi> without pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving <hi>one ſingle Charge</hi> againſt them, in Principle or Practice, but on the contrary, owns them orthodox? Might not ſuch Language, without Surprize, provoke ſome Acrimony or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partee, if it were not that our Lord forbids, to <hi>render Railing for Railing?</hi> May not we therefore rather chuſe to pray, that God may in his due Time, put a Stop to ſuch reproachful Tongues and Pens, which in this particular ſeem to be ſubſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vient to his Intereſt, who is the <hi>Father of Lies,</hi> and the great <hi>Accuſer of the Brethren?</hi> In the mean time, what is the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort of ſuch pious Miniſters, who are thus condemned without any Trial, but that they well know, that it is but a ſmall Thing to be <hi>judged of Man's Judgment,</hi> and that the <hi>righteous Judge of the Quick and the Dead,</hi> who ſtands at the Door and ſits at the Helm, will one Day overhall ſuch raſh Judgments, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover who are <hi>Holy,</hi> and who are <hi>Strangers to the Feelings of the New-Birth?</hi> In the mean time, we wiſh Mr. <hi>T.</hi> no worſe, than to ſee his Error in Time, in thus offending againſt the Generation of God's Children; for tho' <hi>every Bean hath its black,</hi> and every Rank of People their Cullers, yet, may not we on good Grounds hope, that God hath many a precious Saint in the <hi>Body of the Clergy of this Generation?</hi> But who are thoſe that increaſe the Adultery of this Generation more than ſuch, who forſake their own Charges, and induſtriouſly enter into other Men's Labours; who uſe ſneaking Methods, to alienate the Hearts of People from their ſtated Paſtors, to affect and follow them; and who intrude into Vacancies, in the Bounds of other Preſbyteries, in order to withdraw them from their proper Watchmen and to turn them to their Party; and where they cannot gain the whole, encourage Diviſions, that there may be Adultery however, where-ever they can find or make Holes, even tho' they are obliged to make their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance at Back-Doors? And doth not the doleful Caſe of the
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:004792_0047_100DEDF4985C5BD0"/>
Church of God, upon this Account, call more loudly for bitter Lamentation, than upon any other, leſt the tottering Candle-Sticks, that hold forth the Light of God's Word in Purity, be removed, and we be left to wander after glaring Sights and Feelings, under the thick Clouds of enthuſiaſtick Dreams?</p>
            <p>But to proceed to the <hi>Second Inference.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> I. Is not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> in his ſecond Inference, as hard and bitter upon the Hearers of ſuch Miniſters, or thoſe that content themſelves under their Miniſtry, as he is in the firſt upon the Miniſters themſelves? For are not they condemned as ſuch as <hi>have not in them the Temper of Chriſt, and are not they called as blind as Moles, as dead as Stones, poor Fools, poor ſilly Souls, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſpiritual Taſte or Reliſh?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> II. Will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tell us, Whether the Caution Chriſt gave, <hi>not to call our Brother a Fool,</hi> was given to the Laity, or Clergy, or to both? For what puzzles us is, that we have heard ſomething of ſome Privilege called <hi>the Benefit of the Clergy,</hi> and we would know, whether there be ſome ſecret Law that gives the Clergy Liberty to revile, rail at, abuſe and reproach their Hearers, if they do it under the Name or Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of Preaching? For if it be true, that God's Law forbids the natural Man to meddle in ſacred Things, may not there be ſome Law, that gives the ſpiritual Man Liberty to uſe his Tongue as if it was his own? Or elſe why is there ſo much of this done by ſome? Or is there ſome Myſtery in the declining State of the Church that warrants this? If Miniſters go to rail in the Pulpit, can there be any ſolid Reaſon given, why the People ſhould not have Liberty to anſwer them? What is the Reaſon, why by the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> Noblemen have the Privilege that none of them can be bound to the Peace, but becauſe the Peace is ſuppoſed to be always bound to them? And can Goſpel-Miniſters think, that they ſhould have Liberty to crow over their Hearers any longer than they are the Meſſengers of Truth and Peace? Will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tell us, what ſort of Creatures are thoſe, that count meer Railery, bold Aſſertions, bitter Invectives, and clamorous Exclamations, powerful Preaching? Does Mr. <hi>T.</hi> think, that People are ſilly, becauſe they are ſilent, or becauſe they will not ſtoop to kiſs the Pope's Toe, in order to be made Saints; or becauſe they will not go over the River to fetch muddy Water, when they have much clearer Water running in their own Spouts, and at their Doors? Would it not be good Advice to
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:004792_0048_100DEDF7E7A356C0"/>
Mr. <hi>W-d</hi> and <hi>T.</hi> to winnow their Seed a little better than they ſeem to have done of late, leſt they provoke ſome of theſe ſilent Fellows, to ſpeak rough-hewn <hi>Scotch</hi> or <hi>Welſh</hi> to them? For have not ſuch ſilent Fellows time to think, and their Fortunes at command? Can any then think but that they dare ſpeak the Truth bare-facedly, without Palliation? Can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> think that abuſing People at this odd Rate, is the Way to proſelite any People, but thoſe of whoſe Intellectuals he hath juſt Cauſe to think nothing but what is mean and contemptible, or elſe are ſome way diſaffected to their own Miniſters, or their Fellow-Members? But in caſe we were ſuch ſilly Souls, is not the Cure eaſy? For if we take good Courage to rail at our own Miniſters and Preſbyterial Order, wink hard, and lift up our Legs, ſo as not to ſtumble at Mr. <hi>W-d</hi>'s and <hi>T.</hi>'s Errors and Diſorders, reſign our Reaſons by taking other Men to ſee, feel, taſte, reliſh and judge for us; may not we hope to hear ourſelves proclaimed Converts for all this? And ſeeing Mr. <hi>T.</hi> would have us conſider <hi>Jer.</hi> v. 30.31. We have done it; and now propoſe this ſhort Query thereupon, <hi>viz.</hi> Is it not Fact, that Mr. <hi>W—d</hi> pretends to an immediate Call and Miſſion; to act and think by the immediate Guidance of a divine Inſpiration; and yet doth not he preach and print many Falſhoods? Doth not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and his Party get greater Sway by his means, <hi>viz.</hi> his proclaiming them faithful Miniſters of Chriſt, <hi>&amp;c.?</hi> And do not many of the <hi>People love to have it ſo?</hi> And is not the Beginning of theſe Things the Beginning of Sorrow? And muſt not Time anſwer what <hi>the End</hi> of them will be? But can it be expected, that ſowing Thiſtles will produce a better Return than a Crop of Thorns? Further, ſeeing it is our Turn to ſpeak, We wou'd have Mr. <hi>T.</hi> conſider, whether or no he diſcovers Prudence, Piety, or even <hi>great Experience of the Difficulties which pious Souls are expoſed to in this Valley of Tears,</hi> in his reflecting in ſuch a taunting ſcoffing manner upon Miniſters and People, for <hi>counting Deſpair a terrible Thing, and cautioning People againſt it?</hi> Who can believe Mr. <hi>T.</hi> is in earneſt? For is not Deſpair really a terrible Thing? Is it not one of the greateſt Sins that Men can be guilty of under Goſpel Light and Offers, upon many Accounts? And if we conſider it as a Puniſhment; is it not a little Hell upon Earth to the Soul that is burdened with it? And is it not one of the worſt Ingredients of the Miſery of damned Souls? For how could their Miſery be compleat if they had but Glimmerings of
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:004792_0048_100DEDF7E7A356C0"/>
Hope? What Temptations more dreadful than thoſe which Deſpair diſpoſes the Soul to fall in with, if preventing or reſtraining Grace ſteps not in? And hath not the falſe Doctrine ſo much harped upon, <hi>viz. that every one that is in a State of Grace, knows it,</hi> a native Tendency to draw weak and doubting Chriſtians into Deſpair, as well as to hinder their Comfort? For how can any anſwer it to God or their own Conſciences, when duly awakened, if they drive Men to Deſpair by meer Falſhoods, when in Reality they betray the true Scripture Doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of Aſſurance by ſuch blind Puſhes? For when profeſſed <hi>Calviniſts</hi> aſſert, that all true Chriſtians have Aſſurance, which is the ſame as knowing that we are in a State of Grace, when their Opponents can prove, that many true Chriſtians are under Fears and Doubts, and that others arrive no higher than a well-pounded Hope; will not this have a native Tendency to render <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>e very Doctrine of Aſſurance more ſuſpicious to the Contrary-minded? And ſo what do Men do by ſuch blind Puſhes, but on the one Hand betray Truth with a broad Kiſs, and on the other <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>and form a Club to its Antagoniſt, to daſh out its Brains? Beſides, are not Miniſters as great, if not greater Debtors to the Weak, than the Strong? Should not they therefore feed them with Milk, if they are not able to endure ſtrong Meat? For is not he an unmerciful and an unnatural Father, that gives a Child crying for Bread, a Stone to break his Teeth, or crying for Fiſh, a Scorpion to poiſon him, by telling him a rough terrifying Error inſtead of Truth, in order to caſt him from Fear to Deſpair?</p>
            <p n="3">3. As to the third Inference we approve of it?</p>
            <p n="4">4. As to the fourth Inference, which ſeems to have been the main Scope of the Performance, <hi>viz.</hi> To diſſolve all relative Bonds and Ties between Paſtor and People, at leaſt to proclaim them null and void, as to People's Obligation therefrom to attend upon the Adminiſtrations of their own fixed Paſtors ſtatedly; ſo that if we take Mr. <hi>T.</hi> up right, his declared Judgment here is, that People, after the Choice of a Miniſter to be their ſtated Paſtor, are at their free Liberty to abſent themſelves from his Miniſtry, as far and as often as they or any of them pleaſes, whether the Miniſter be godly or graceleſs: If godly, then the Opinion of <hi>another's ſuperiour Gifts,</hi> yea, the <hi>Judgment or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination</hi> of any Perſon, or even the Conceit or <hi>Hope of getting greater Benefit elſewhere,</hi> are pleaded by Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to be ſufficient

Reaſons for any Perſon to leave his own Paſtor, and to go for ordinary to hear another, (for occaſional Hearing is out of the Queſtion;) much more if any of them gueſſes that <hi>his Miniſter is a carnal Man,</hi> then he ought to leave him; ſo that there ſeems to be a wide Door opened for any Member to deſert his Miniſter upon any kind of Diſtaſte or Diſſatisfaction, without being accountable to any about it.</p>
            <p>To prevent Miſtakes, we ſhall premiſe a few preliminary Queſtions, then ſtate the Matter, and afterwards examine the main Hinges of Argument uſed by Mr. <hi>T.</hi> here.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> I Let it be granted, that People may go to hear other Miniſters beſides their own occaſionally, without Offence; yet is it not too great a Stride to argue from thence, that Men may make a common Practice of this? For doth not the latter carry in it a plain Contempt of the ſacred Adminiſtration of their own Miniſter, and many other Evils? And to pretend to do this in a Spirit of Meekneſs, when no apparent Reaſon is aſſigned, what is it better than a <hi>Judas</hi>'s Kiſs? Can any like <hi>Jacob</hi>'s ſmooth Voice, when he feels <hi>Eſau</hi>'s rough Hands and heavy Fiſts?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> II. Let it be granted, that Men may go without Offence to hear other orthodox and regular Miniſters at Seaſons, beſides their own; yet will not the Caſe alter, if Men are heterodox or blemiſhed in their Doctrine, or diſorderly in their Manner of Entrance, whereby the Rights and ſacred Order of Religious Societies are infringed?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> III. Let it be granted, that People may to go hear other Miniſters, that are for carrying on the common Intereſt in an united peaceable Way and Manner, by endeavouring to ſtreng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then the Hands of the ſtated Paſtors, and to cultivate a good Underſtanding between Paſtors and People; yet will not the Cauſe alter, if Itinerants uſe diviſive factious Methods in the moſt bare-faced manner, by crying up themſelves, and exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing againſt all but their own Party, ſetting up Threſhold againſt Threſhold, and Altar againſt Altar, encouraging Factions, by preſſing People to forſake their own Miniſters, whether they are gracious or graceleſs?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> IV. Let it be granted, that if Men can prove any Articles of Charge againſt their Miniſter in Doctrine, Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline or Deportment, that they ought to be heard, and that Miniſters and People ought to be dealt with accordingly; and
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:004792_0049_100DEDF9964DDAA8"/>
that if after due Trial to accommodate Matters in a Goſpel-Way, the Party offending proves obſtinate, and will not ſubmit to Goſpel-Rules, that then the injured Party ſhould be ſet at Liberty; if Matters are come to that Heighth, which ought to be the laſt Remedy; ye<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> more, let it be granted, that if People acting a conſcientious Part, can produce any true Account, that may ſatisfy impartial judicious Perſons, that they have proved any Charges of Weight againſt their Miniſters, for which they ought in Juſtice to be diſcarded, but were kept in, contrary to Rule; if after patient Writing and due Remonſtrances of juſt Grievances, in lower and higher Judicatures, People ſail to get the Cauſes of juſt Offence removed, that then the People may and ought, in Obedience to God and the Dictates of their own Conſciences, to ſeek for the beſt Expedient they can get elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where; but yet, can any prove from any Part of Scripture, that any thing will warrant the common Practice of inſulting the ſacred Adminiſtrations of our own ſtated Paſtors, but what will warrant a total Separation from ſuch? And will any ſay, that a Separation from a Church, with which we have <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

And ought not all orderly Non-conformiſts, to bear a publick Teſtimony againſt, and Abhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of ſuch impious Inſinuations, as have a native Tendency to wound and expoſe Religion, and the Credit of its true Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors, to the Deriſion of its Oppoſers?</p>

Did not the Apoſtles and Evangeliſts, by divine Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, fix a mutual and particular Relation between particular Paſtors and particular People, when they ordained Elders in every City? <hi>Tit.</hi> i. 5. And hath not God's Church, in all Ages ſince, thought this a ſufficient Warrant, to act by the Pattern then given, both as to forming particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and in giving the Overſight of them to particular Paſtors in the Lord? And is it not the peculiar Privilege of the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a particular Church, as ſuch, to have a Vote in chuſing and calling a particular Miniſter, to take the Overſight of them, in the Lord, as a diſtinct Body or Society, into which none is to be admitted but upon Trial, Approbation and Conſent, and out of which none is to depart orderly, but upon weighty Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons offered, which in their very Nature demand Conſent? And hath not the Miniſter thus choſen, as the Charge of the Work and Flock devolved upon him, ſo alſo the Rule and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority over his Flock, to command their Attendance upon his orderly and timous Adminiſtrations? For as the Miniſter at his Ordination, declares his Reſolution to act his Part with Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulneſs, do not the People alſo, with up-lifted Hand, vow and declare their Willingneſs to receive and acknowledge him, as a Miniſter of Chriſt, and to obey and ſubmit unto him, and to wait upon his ſacred Adminiſtrations, as having the Rule over them in the Lord, as well as to maintain, encourage and aſſiſt him in all the Parts of his Office? Now when this is done in the moſt ſolemn Manner, with Faſting and Prayer, by what Authority or Rule may a Perſon break or diſſolve that Relation, by acting as if he ſtood not in ſuch Relation, as ſoon as any bold Intruder ſhall come to make a Party, by entering into other Men's Labours? How can a Shepherd feed his Flock, if they are not obliged to keep under his Care? How can he lead them to Paſture, if they are not bound to keep under his Paſtoral Rod? What ſignifies the Steward's dividing every Man his Portion, and ſtudying to do it with Faithfulneſs and Impartiality, if the Houſhold come not to receive it? What ſignifies chuſing of Guides, if Men are not bound to follow them? What ſignifies chuſing Watchmen, if Men keep not within hearing of their Warning, nor take Warning when our proper Watchmen give

What ſignifies ſtudying of Sermons to ſuit the Caſe of the Flock, if they be not bound to attend the publick Meetings? Yea, how ſhall publick Worſhip be eſtabliſhed, and kept up ſtatedly, any where, if the Members of particular Congregations are at Liberty not to attend, at their own Humours? Doth not ſuch a Principle encourage People to Humorouſneſs, Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Anarchy and Confuſion, ſo that whenever they take any Diſguſt upon any Occaſion, be it never ſo unjuſt and unreaſona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, they may go and come at Pleaſure, as if they were under no Bond at all? Would not eſtabliſhing ſuch Rules as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> lays down here, with Reſpect to People's leaving their own Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters, be Phariſaical <hi>with a Witneſs?</hi> For would not they as effectually make void God's Inſtitution of particular Congrega<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Miniſtry, to all Intents and Purpoſes, as ever the Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees made God's Commands of none Effect, by their Tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions?</p>
            <p>If we miſtake not, Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Arguings here are built upon ſome obſolete or new coined Maxims, which have not been cur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent among Proteſtants in theſe laſt Ages, whether becauſe of their Orthodoxy or Declinings, we will leave that to the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der's Judgment, after we have given our Opinion in the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter? For tho' we are not ſo vain, as to pretend Infallibility in making Gueſſes, yet we ſee no Reaſon, why we may not be ſuppoſed to be as capable of forming nearer Gueſſes of the To<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>picks of a Man's Arguments in his Writings, than the ſpiritual Man can of the ſecret States of Men's Souls by their verbal Declarations: If therefore we gueſs right, we are of the Mind, that Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Arguments are fetched from or founded on the following Topicks, or at leaſt, that the following Propoſitions are the Native Conſequences of his Doctrine here, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. That People have a Right to their ſtated Miniſter's La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours; but yet, that he hath no Right or Authority, to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand their Attendance upon his ſacred publick Adminiſtrations, any further than their Humours are pleaſed or their Inclinations lead them: So that tho' in all other Relations the Poſſeſſion is mutual, as 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> vii. 4. but yet in the Relation between Paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:004792_0051_100DF016B1C83F58"/>
and People, it is wholly of the People's Side: So that it is good <hi>Engliſh</hi> for People to tell their Miniſter, <hi>All that is yours is ours, but we are wholly our own for all that.</hi> How elſe can we force that Text in 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> iii. 22. to prove, that God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have a Right to the Gifts of all God's Miniſters alike, and that therefore they are at their own Liberty to leave their own Miniſters, and <hi>to make uſe of the Gifts of another</hi> at their own Pleaſure, without <hi>wronging</hi> any? But can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> think, that Gods Intent in that Text is, to tell every particular Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation, or any Sect of People, that all the Particulars con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in that Text were theirs equally, as to their Uſe, upon their clearing to themſelves and Party their Title to Chriſt? For would not they be unholy Saints, that would claim and uſe ſuch a Right? And would not others have a very unhappy World to live in, if ever ſuch unruly Creatures ſhould become the moſt numerous Party?

And will he tell us, what are his Arguings bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter than theirs? For if this Text may ſerve to diſſolve one ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred Relation, why not all Relations? And why may not <hi>Things preſent, and Things to come,</hi> and the World, include the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of <hi>All?</hi> And what miſerable Work may enſue, if ſuch a Conceit, as that <hi>Life and Death</hi> is theirs, in the ſame exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive miſtaken Senſe? It coſt us ſome Thoughts what could be the Meaning of the Pope's Liberality (who is otherwiſe Niggard enough) in beſtowing the Title of Catholicks upon his meaneſt Followers, until we read upon his Mitre the Name of <hi>Catholick</hi> or <hi>Univerſal Biſhop;</hi> Is not he hereby entitled to all the Cream that drops from the Name, when the poor People have no more than an empty Title; which entitles them to no more than the heavy Burden of feeding and maintaining <hi>Swarms of greedy Locuſts</hi> with the Sweat of their Brows and their Hearts Blood? How vain then is it for Proteſtants, to cheat themſelves with the Noiſe of the Name of Catholicks? For may not Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tholick Miniſters, if we make ſuch, claim to be ſpiritual Men two Ways <hi>viz.</hi> By <hi>Office</hi> and <hi>Grace;</hi> whereas the People have but a ſingle Claim, and ſo, inſtead of the Tenth, claim all to be theirs? And if Men will make an Engine of falſe Gloſſes upon Scripture Texts, to rob Miniſters of their juſt Authority
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:004792_0051_100DF016B1C83F58"/>
over their People, may not we ſoon ſee the Time, when ſuch Gloſſes will be made uſe of, for Ropes to hang the religious Rights of the People? For are not both founded on the ſame Bottom? And if we do not maintain both, how ſoon ſhall we loſe both? Is not this Catholick Mode the ready Way for Men to increaſe the Number of Teachers to an unſupportable Burden, when in reality they are deſtitute of a Paſtor to take Care of the Flock? Is not graſping at all, the Way to loſe the little one hath? Can any think, that thoſe Congregations are better ſupplied, whoſe Miniſters are whole Months abroad, than thoſe whoſe Miniſters tarry with them? To have a Right to the Gifts of all Miniſters are big Words; but if at the ſame Time others have as good a Right as we to our own Miniſter's La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours, ſo that he muſt act accordingly, will this big Right make us fat? And if on the other Hand Mr. <hi>T.</hi> once allows, that a Miniſter hath Authority to command his People's Attendance upon his publick Adminiſtrations, will not his Arguments on this Head prove meer Cobweb?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Maxim, which ſeems to be at the Bottom of Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s Arguings here is, That a Miniſter is bound to his People, but that the People are as free from their Miniſter after a Call, Choice, and contracting the Relation of Paſtor and Flock, as before. How elſe can there be room <hi>for Men's coveting the beſt Gifts and proving all Things</hi> after the Match is made? Is it not enough that Men have Liberty to dandle and kiſs other Women when they are ſingle; but when married, ſhould not they delight themſelves always in their own Fountain or Ciſtern? For how can Men hope that God will deliver them from Evil, if they lead themſelves into Temptation, by embracing the Boſom of a Stranger? And what but this can we make of the Out cry made here againſt <hi>binding Men to particular Miniſters againſt their Judgment and Inclinations, when they are better edified elſe-where, calling it carnal with a Witneſs, a cruel Oppreſſion of tender Conſciences, compelling Men to ſin; for he that doubts is damned if he eats?</hi> What is the meaning of this Out-cry? Is it not very like the Out-cry <hi>A. B. Whitgift</hi> once made about their woful and diſtreſſed State, when the Parliament was like to paſs a Bill againſt Pluralities? But what is this cruel Yoke that Men are in Danger of now? Is it any more than this, let every Man have his own Wife, and every Woman her own Huſband, and let every Flock that have got an orderly Paſtor attend for ordinary
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:004792_0052_100DEE229E0A75D0"/>
upon his Adminiſtrations, obey him in the Lord, and eſteem him highly for his Work's Sake? And what if it was added to this, Let every Miniſter for ordinary reſide with his own Flock, would any Man deſerve the Character of an Oppoſer of God's Work for ſaying ſo? Will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tell us, where among the Non-Conformiſts have Men been bound to a Miniſter againſt their Judgment and Inclination? Hath ever a Miniſter been ſettled in any of our Congregations, but upon the Call and Choice of the People? And is it not a greater Privilege and Liberty for a People to have a pious Miniſter of their own Choice to attend upon, than to be vagabond Stragglers from Place to Place as <hi>Sheep without a Shepherd?</hi> And when Men have an orderly Miniſter, where is the Carnality of obliging them to diſcharge their Duties to God and to their o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>es for the Community of Goods and Wives as well as of Miniſters, or for deſerting their own Wives, as well as Flock or Paſtors, to cloak Sin and Diſorder? And are not the Duties of Miniſters and People as plainly required as the other? What is that unſcriptural Doctrine or Practice that is impoſed? Who can ſet Men at Liberty from relative Goſpel Duties? Is there no Difference between Chriſtian Liberty and Licentiouſneſs, Anar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy and Diſorder? Is not the one a Liberty to preach and profeſs Truth, to obſerve Order, and to perform the Duties of their Place and Relations peaceably? What do conſcientious Non-Conformiſts want more than this? Muſt Men have Liberty beſides this to ſpread Errors, to confound Order, to diſturb others in the orderly Exerciſes of Piety, by rambling up and down to raiſe Factions, Feuds and Contentions, and to carnalize, devilize, phariſize, and abuſe Men, with the Nick-names of <hi>Dupes and Dunces,</hi> meerly becauſe they do not run with them into the ſame Exceſs of Riot, as they do?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Maxim is, That the Determinations of Miniſters and Seſſions touching the Liberty or Diſmiſſion of particular Members, is to be founded upon and over-ruled by the Judgment and Inclination of ſuch Members; ſo that all the Authority that Church Rulers in ſuch Matters ſeemingly are allowed to exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciſe, is no other or more, but only to enquire what are the Judgments and Inclinations of particular Members, with reſpect to adhering to or leaving their own Paſtor, and then to give
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:004792_0052_100DEE229E0A75D0"/>
them Liberty to act herein as they ſee fit; for how without this, can there be room to plead <hi>Men's Judgment and Inclinations as juſt Reaſons</hi> to juſtify their forſaking their own Aſſemblies, where God's Word is purely and therefore powerfully preached, and his Ordinances adminiſtred in Purity? Have not the beſt Men in this imperfect State oft ſuch corrupt Inclinations as will as naturally lead them to Sin and Diſorder, as <hi>the Eagles fly to the ſtinking Carcaſs,</hi> if Men give Way to them? What if the Judgment or Inclination of the Member appears to the Miniſter and Seſſion inconſiſtent to Goſpel Rule and Order, muſt they thereupon give Way to Men's Neglect of Duty and committing Sins, without bearing Witneſs againſt them for both?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another Maxim is, That every Member, after ſolemn devoting or giving up of himſelf to God, his Church, and it's Rulers, to walk in Church Fellowſhip with them, and to be ruled by them according to God's Word, is ſtill Judge in his own Caſe, how long and how often he will attend upon or abſent from the publick Adminiſtrations of his choſen ſtated Paſtor, without being accountable to his Paſtor or Fellow-members for his Neglect herein: For if the Member pleads <hi>Inclination or Opinion of being better edified elſewhere,</hi> is not he at Liberty according to Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s Rule? Who then is Judge in the Caſe? What then is become of the Right of Societies in their Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers? May not Wantonneſs, vain Curioſity, Love of Novelties, Diſguſt, Want of Love to Truth and Goſpel Order, vain Admiration of glaring Errors and Diſorders, when nick-named Reformation, or even the Having of Perſons in Admiration, incline Men to deſert their own orderly Paſtor, as well as better Principles? How then is it poſſible for Goſpel Rule to take Place, where ſuch vain Notions prevail?</p>
            <p n="5">5. Another Maxim is, That ſecret Reaſons or Surmiſes in a Man's own Breaſt, of which he can make no apparent Proof, are ſufficient Grounds to diſſolve the Relation between Paſtor and Flock, at leaſt to juſtify Men's Non-Attendance upon the Adminiſtrations of their proper Paſtors: For according to <hi>Mr. T.</hi>'s Rule, if a Member is uncharitable enough to condemn his own Paſtor for <hi>a carnal Man,</hi> tho' he is orthodox and regular; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> pretends <hi>he is not edified by him,</hi> tho' his Doctrine is ſound, and his Life exemplary, or is prejudiced againſt him, ſo that tho' he once conſcientiouſly judged him <hi>a gifted Man,</hi> who appears to be ſo ſtill to more judicious Perſons, yet if upon a

ſlender Trial he thinks another <hi>more gifted than him,</hi> or if he hath fallen out with him, tho' that may be upon the Account of his Faithfulneſs, ſo that he <hi>is not inclined</hi> to hear him, is not he at Liberty, at leaſt if he hath the Art of Diſſembling ſo far as to give his Miniſter a <hi>Judas Kiſs</hi> at parting, may not he bid him Good-Night at Noon-Day? Is it not a brave Thing that Church-Members, at leaſt diſſatisfied ones, have ſuch an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage over their reſpective Paſtors, ſo that if they want to deſert them upon any Difference whatſoever, is it not the eaſieſt Thing in the World to make a plauſible Pretence of one of theſe ſurmiſed Excuſes? and then will he not be capped to all Intents and Purpoſes? For then hath not he got him upon the Hugg, yea, the <hi>Corniſh Hugg,</hi> and down he goes? For if he is a gifted Man, what Difficulty is it for ill Humour, to call him a <hi>carnal Man,</hi> a <hi>Phariſee,</hi> and to fill the Buſhel, an <hi>Ahitophel</hi> too? If he be a gracious mild Man, is it not eaſy to call him a <hi>well-meaning ignorant Ruſtick?</hi> But if he be both a gifted and gracious Man, what Difficulty is it to tell him that he <hi>preaches too profound Divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity,</hi> and that <hi>Men are better edified elſewhere?</hi> If he happens to demand an Account of the Perſon's Edification, <hi>viz.</hi> what new Leſſons he hath learned, or Progreſs he hath made in practical Godlineſs more than before? may not he tell him, that <hi>this is begging the Queſtion, he feels it, he believes it, he knows it, he aſſerts, and he will ſtand to it, and that Thouſands think ſo as well as himſelf?</hi> and may not he add to all this, that <hi>it is as plain as the Sun, and that he is blind that doth not ſee it, yea, as blind as a Mole, as dead as a Stone, a Dupe, a Dunce, without any ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual Taſte or Reliſh?</hi> And if the Pariſh Miniſter be ſo obſtinate as to call all this no more than bold Say-ſoes; is not there a Remedy for that alſo? for may not the Church-Member tell his Paſtor, that <hi>it is his Inclination to leave him, and to go elſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where?</hi> And ſo may not we have Uſe for an old ruſty Rhime?
<q>
                  <l>I do not love thee Dr. <hi>Fell,</hi> the Reaſon why I cannot tell;</l>
                  <l>But this is all that I can tell, I do not love thee Dr. <hi>Fell.</hi>
                  </l>
               </q>
Is not this ſubſtantial Divinity? And when a Perſon rhymes it ſo pleaſantly too, hath not he a Buſhel full of the <hi>Spirit of Meekneſs?</hi> And if the Miniſter be not carnal with a Witneſs, can he offer to ſay one Word more? But if he does, will it not give the Member double Advantage over him, to call him a carnal unconverted Phariſee, an Oppreſſor of tender Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and if he ſays but little, but grieves at the hearing

of ſuch ſorry Reaſons, ſpoken with ſuch Confidence, if all that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſays be true, will not this be <hi>a Sign of his Rottenneſs and Hypocriſy?</hi> Are not theſe great Proficients! For cannot they def<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Well, well, Men may deceive them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, and mock others like themſelves with ſuch Stuff; but will God be mocked alſo, and count this Religion?

            <p n="6">6. In order to fortify Men's Plea of their getting more Edi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication over the Pariſh Line, than within it, we think we ſee another Maxim half forged out, but either for Want of ſodder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or a welding-Heat, or becauſe of the ſtubborn Temper of the Metal, it ſeems ſo full of Flaws, that it wants the ſecond Heat or Purification, before it be fit to be handled but very gingerly, which is this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Benefit of Hearers or the Succeſs of a Miniſter's Performances, depends ſometimes upon the Miniſter's <hi>ſuperiour Gifts,</hi> ſometimes <hi>Grace</hi> carries the Day, ſometimes <hi>the Judgment or Inclination of the People</hi> will do Wonders, whatever the Miniſter be, for aught appears; but low to reconcile theſe jarring Elements with themſelves or Scripture, which teaches, that the Efficacy of divine Ordinances depends upon God's Bleſſing and Co-operation, muſt be left to further Enquiry.</p>
            <p n="7">7. That private Members may know when their Miniſters are Graceleſs, albeit they cannot prove any Charges againſt their Doctrine or Deportment; for if they can do the latter, why are Men ſo much in Love with graceleſs Men, when they exclaim ſo loudly againſt them, as not to proſecute them? Can it be for Want of Good-Will? Or if they are willing, how are Men ſo unſkilful as to pitch upon <hi>ſecret Surmiſes,</hi> which they cannot prove true, when at the ſame Time it is in their Power to produce apparent Proofs, which would deſerve Hearing? For does not the uſing of the former Shifts, prove the Dearth of the latter?</p>
            <p n="8">8. Another Maxim is, That a diſſatisfied Member, that hath taken ſome Diſguſt at, or is at Variance with his Miniſter, right or wrong, is in a Capacity to make a truer Judgment of the Gifts and Graces of his Miniſter, as well as of his own
<pb n="106" facs="unknown:004792_0054_100DEEA152F64750"/>
Edification by his Miniſtry, than he himſelf could make when he reſpected him, or than the whole Congregation and Preſby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tery could make at his Ordination, at leaſt, than what his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Well-wiſhers do make of theſe Matters. How elſe can ſuch <hi>ſecret Surmiſes</hi> be pleaded to be <hi>juſt Cauſes of Separation</hi> from him?</p>
            <p n="9">9. Another Maxim is, That all the Conceits Men entertain, and all the vain boaſting Men make <hi>of their Benefit and Edifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion out of the Pariſh-line,</hi> are not only all true, but alſo ſuch <hi>evident Truths,</hi> as ſhould ſway Miniſters and Seſſions to give up their Right in ſuch Members. How elſe can this be pleaded to be a <hi>ſufficient Ground</hi> to deſert the Adminiſtrations of one's proper Paſtor, for all in general that make it? For is it not eaſy to prove by apparent Fruits, that many pretend to much Benefit, who are ſenſibly hurt, in the Judgment of others more judicious in ſuch Matters? And is it not well known, that the Account that ſome of them give of the Matter is very lame?</p>
            <p n="10">10. Another Maxim is, That deſerting, cenſuring and abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing their own orderly Paſtors, and falling in with their Side, according to Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Rule, is a ſure Sign <hi>of Grace and Conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion;</hi> but adhering to their own Miniſters, is a true Sign of <hi>carnal Men.</hi> How elſe are the uneaſy and diſſatisfied, through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out this Sermon, proclaimed <hi>pious, godly Souls,</hi> and the Adherents to their own Paſtors are nick-named <hi>Dupes and Dunces, &amp;c. with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any ſpiritual Taſte or Reliſh?</hi> We grant, that ſuch private Members as make groundleſs Exclamations againſt their own Miniſters, upon <hi>meer Surmiſes,</hi> are fit Followers to ſuch Preachers as do the like; but yet, we would aſk, whether thoſe that admire glaring Errors and Diſorders or thoſe that oppoſe them, are the <hi>greateſt Dupes and Dunces,</hi> or give the beſt Proofs of their Grace?</p>
            <p n="11">11. There ſeems to be another Maxim deſigned out of all, which, if it could be proved, would be worth all the Reſt, <hi>viz.</hi> To make People believe, that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and his Party are the <hi>only ſpiritual Men and gracious Miniſters,</hi> and all his Oppoſers <hi>Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrites;</hi> the <hi>only wiſe Men,</hi> and others but <hi>ignorant Ruſticks;</hi> at leaſt the <hi>only edifying Preachers,</hi> and all the reſt being but <hi>lame Men,</hi> and unfit for the Work; for if they have <hi>Grace,</hi> they want <hi>Gifts,</hi> or if they have <hi>Gifts,</hi> they want <hi>Grace,</hi> or if they have a little <hi>of both,</hi> they preach againſt the <hi>Errors and Diſorders of the Times,</hi> and therefore their Sermon are unedifying

to ſuch as are projecting how to build a <hi>Babel.</hi> Now, as this laſt ſeems to be the Deſign of the whole Performance, may it not be worth our while to conſider, what are the Proofs offered to ſupport it? This will appear then,</p>
            <p n="1">1. If we conſider the profeſſed Scope of the whole Sermon, <hi>viz.</hi> To exclaim againſt carnal, unconverted Miniſters, judging them ſeverely, and, according to Mr. <hi>T.</hi> Rule, <hi>Hypocrites are againſt all judging of others, in order to hide their own Filthineſs;</hi> and therefore to be ſure publick Exclaimers againſt Hypocrites are all honeſt Men, for is not this built on another ſure Maxim, <hi>viz.</hi> A Whore was never heard to call her Companion a Whore in the wide World, leſt ſhe ſhould retort and call her a filthy Strumpet?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Proof is, The Crowds follow them, and doth not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> give us Scripture Proof for this, <hi>where-ever the Carcaſe is, there Eagles will be gathered,</hi> and may not we add another as much to the Purpoſe every whit, <hi>Rev.</hi> xiii. 3. <hi>and all the World wondered after the Beaſt?</hi> But before we can apply Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Text to the Matter in Hand, muſt not we have ſome Rule, ſuch as, <hi>As the Wheel-barrow rumbles over the Pebbles, ſo a Thumb-Rope of Sand will make an excellent Cable for the Fiſhers Folly:</hi> If it were not a diſtinct Application here might be thought too homely, Is it not eaſy for a carnal Man to be diſtinct? We ſhall then only aſk, who are the Eagles; what is the preſent Carcaſe; and what draws the Eagles to the Carcaſs? If Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will be accounted a ſpiritual Man, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to his own Rule, muſt not he be diſtinct in applying his own Compariſons? Who was he that aſſigned <hi>Univerſality</hi> for a Mark of the true Church? But if ever we ſaw the Picture of the Horſe in the Mill, may not we ſee it here? The Miniſters are good Men, becauſe the Crowds follow them; and the Crowds that follow them are Converts, becauſe they are graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Miniſters, and the Multitude's Attachment to them proves it?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Proof is, Becauſe others do not put Men into ſuch deep Convictions and under ſuch deep Horror, as makes them cry, roar, faint and roll on the Ground, or ſo as to run into Halters; or as to caſt them into Fits and Convulſions, as ſome do. What would a carnal Man be judged worthy of ſome Months ago, if he ſhould ſay as much as Mr. <hi>W.</hi> does of theſe bodily Convulſions, viz. <hi>That he believes they come from
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:004792_0055_100DEEA2D7A066A0"/>
the Devil,</hi> Journal, vol. 3. p. 63? We own that we do not find, that theſe were plenty among Proteſtants, by any Account we can get, but in the firſt breaking out of <hi>Quakeriſm;</hi> but if ſome Travellers are to be credited, are not they much more plenty in the Popiſh Dominions? For, when the Prieſts kindle the Flames of <hi>Purgatory</hi> into a terrible Bonfire, when the Pope's Bulls make an hideous roaring, when the Noiſe of the Wheels of the <hi>Inquiſition Coach</hi> rattle, how can the poor People, that are kept in ſuch profound Ignorance, poiſoned with Superſtition, and broken-hearted with ſlaviſh Fear, bear ſuch Thunder-Claps, without being put into a Conſternation? But then the Query is, whether ſuch Shocks are the Fruit of Guilt or of Grace, of Ignorance or of Knowledge, of Faith or Unbelief, of Hope or Deſpair?</p>
            <p>Before we come to make cloſer Remarks upon particular Arguments here, it may be, it will not be amiſs to tranſcribe a Paragraph out of Mr. <hi>Burrough</hi>'s <hi>Irenicum,</hi> pag. 84.85. "<hi>The ſixth dividing Principle,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>is, What is beſt in itſelf muſt be choſen and done, not weighing Circumſtances or References.</hi>—</p>
            <p>
               <hi>It is,</hi> ſaith he, <hi>in itſelf a better Thing to enjoy a Miniſtry of the moſt eminent Gift and Graces, than one of lower, but if this ſhould be made a Rule, that a Man who is under a Paſtor, who is faithful and in ſome good Meaſure gifted, upon another Man's coming into the Country, that is more eminent, he ſhould forſake his Paſtor and join to the other; and if after this ſtill a more eminent Man comes, he ſhould leave the former and join to him; and by the ſame Law, a Paſtor, who hath a good People, yet if others be more likely to receive more Good, he may leave his own People, and go to them; what Confuſion and Diſorder would there be continually in the Church? Men muſt conſider not only what the Thing is in it's own Nature, but what it is to them, how it ſtands in Reference to their Relations. If you be joined to a Paſtor, ſo as you believe he is ſet over you by Chriſt, to be a Paſtor to you, though this Man hath meaner Gifts than others, and it would he more comfortable for you to have another Paſtor; yet this is not enough to cauſe you to deſert him whom Chriſt hath ſet over you; and if People may not leave their Paſtors, becauſe others have more eminent Gifts, then ſurely Paſtors muſt not leave their People, becauſe others have more eminent Livings.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>T.</hi> here points out three or four Cauſes, which he aſſerts to be ſufficient Grounds to juſtify Men in deſerting their own
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:004792_0055_100DEEA2D7A066A0"/>
Miniſter's Adminiſtrations, and to go for ordinary to hear another, <hi>viz.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſeems to aſſert, That People's Notion of their own Miniſter's having <hi>leſſer Gifts than a Stranger,</hi> will juſtify the Deſerting of the former, and going to the latter <hi>frequently.</hi> pag. 19.20.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> I. Is not ſuch an idolizing Preference of Men upon the Account of ſuperior Gifts, a Reflection upon the Wiſdom of the Author of all Gifts, for his uſing Variety in the Diſtribution of Gifts, who gives to one <hi>five,</hi> to another <hi>two,</hi> to another <hi>one Talent?</hi> Muſt he that hath one Talent be left idle, if he lives nigh one that hath two, and he that hath two be left idle if he lives nigh one that hath five Talents? If ſo, what could he do that had but one Talent, but hide it in a Napkin, if he lived among ſuch People as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> would have all to be? How could he make Uſe of it? And would not ſuch a Method excuſe him that had two in doing in the ſame manner? Beſides, when a whole Congregation and the Preſbytery, after ſolemn calling upon God, and upon fair Trial, may be ſuppoſed to be liable to miſtake, who no doubt judge a Man to have at leaſt a Compe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tency of Gifts, when they give him a Call; and it may be ſtill on good Grounds judge that the deſpiſed Miniſter hath five Talents, and the admired Stranger but two or one; why may not the Diſſatisfied under Diſguſt take the one or two for the five Talents? Is not there more Safety in the Multitude of Counſellors now as well as in <hi>Solomon</hi>'s Time? Further, how without equal Trial of both Miniſters, can any Man form an adequate Judgment of Men's Gifts? Is it not common for Men to admire a Stranger for once or twice wonderfully, whom after a While they think leſs of than their own Miniſters? And may not Men of good Judgment eaſily miſtake a Perſon's Gifts or real Worth upon a tranſient Trial? For is it not known, that one may excel in Judgment, the other in Delivery; the one hath better Matter, the other more flouriſhing Language; the one in Solidity, the other in making a fair Appearance; the one is more zealous, the other is more ſtedfaſt; every one having his peculiar Gifts; and is it not well known, that empty Barrels and ſhallow Waters make always the loudeſt Sound?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> II. Beſides, if Men could form a right Judgment in the Matter, by giving him that hath the five Talents the Preference;
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:004792_0056_100DEEA48137A928"/>
yet would not ſuch a Practice upon ſuch Grounds be idolizing of Inſtruments, by ſuſpending the Succeſs or Benefit of Sermons upon the Gifts of the Preacher, and not on the Bleſſing of God, and the Co-operation of his Spirit? May not he that hath leſs or no Grace excel in Gifts? and muſt a gifted Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite be a fitter Inſtrument for God to work by, than a pious Miniſter of leſs Gifts, and therefore encouraged when the other is deſerted? Hath not God often owned a Man of leſſer Gifts, that is pious, to make him more ſucceſsful than others more gifted? And is not this a very uſual Thing, if not God's moſt common Way, that he may learn us to ceaſe from Man, and that no Fleſh ſhould glory before Him, but that He alone might be exalted? Beſides, tho' we allow, that when a Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation is vacant, that it is their Duty and Intereſt to endeavour by all means, to get a Paſtor of the beſt Gifts they can; but yet is it not one Thing to be wiſe and wary in chuſing a Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter and contracting a Paſtoral Relation, but another Thing to break and cut the Bond of that Relation, after it is voluntarily entered into and contracted? May not there be room for many Conſiderations to take Place, to ſway the Choice in making a Match, which would appear both ridiculous and ſinful when pleaded to be juſt Cauſes of Divorce, after the Marriage-Knot is tied? But yet doth not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> juſtify this Latitude or Licence by putting the married and unmarried upon a Par, as to a ſecond Choice, from <hi>p.</hi> 18 — 22, even ſuppoſing a Perſon's <hi>Paſtor be gracious?</hi> We grant, his Reaſonings may hold in making a Choice before ſuch a Relation be contracted; but how can it afterwards, when the Choice is made and the Match is concluded, not for a Day or during Pleaſure only, but as long as by God's good Providence the ſaid Relation continues, or until it be diſſolved in an orderly Way? And does not this appear to be Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s Mind, if we conſider the Topicks he argues from, <hi>viz. The Birds of the Air, the Fiſhes of the Sea, and the wild Beaſts of the Field?</hi> If there comes out an Act againſt Metaphors, ſhould not there be a Clauſe in it, <hi>viz.</hi> That a Rhetorician ſhould never uſe an Argument, for fear he may come too near to the Heels of Truth? For might not <hi>the tame Aſs that knoweth his Owner, and the Ox that waiteth at his Maſier's Crib,</hi> learn Mr. <hi>T.</hi> a better Leſſon to the Purpoſe in Hard, than wild Fowls Fiſhes or Beaſts, who have no certain Owner, Place or Crib Paſtor or Ruler, Law or Rule of Government, nor capable of
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:004792_0056_100DEEA48137A928"/>
having any, but are leſt to wander as their natural Inſtinct leads them? And yet do not theſe obſerve ſome Order in keeping to their own Flock, and ſome of them to their own Mates, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding their Wanderings and Want of Reaſon? Where then is the Similitude between ſuch Creatures and Church-Members, who are rational Creatures, under a Law, proper Paſtor, divided into ſtated Companies, and under Vows and ſolemn Ties to continue in Church Fellowſhip, and under the Paſtoral Rod and Care of a fixed Paſtor, who is inveſted with the Authority of a Steward, both to feed and to rule his parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Flock, as a diſtinct Body or Houſhold? And are not all the orderly Relations of rational Creatures, whether natural, civil or religious, fixed and ſtated by particular Bounds and Limits, within which Men ſhould keep at leaſt for ordinary? And what is good Order in Church or State, but the due Obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of our proper Limits, by performing the Duties of our Relations in proper Place and Time, without Neglect, as well as without Encroachment or diſturbing of others in their proper Places and Relations? Will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tell us, what is that ordinary Calling or Relation in Church or State of God's Appointment, whereby Men are called to become Wanderers or Vagabonds, as the Fowls of the Air, Fiſhes, or wild Beaſts? Doth not the Chriſtian Religion in its very Nature, according to the ſtated Diſpenſation we are now under, exclude and forbid ſuch Wan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derings any further than Neceſſity or Conveniency requires them? And are not all Wandrings out of meer Choice, our Wanton<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs and Sin? As therefore Mr. <hi>T.</hi> well obſerves, that a Work may be a Duty in the Matter of it, when it is a Sin in the Manner, if not performed according to the Rule; we would aſk, whether or no the Duty of Preaching may not be abuſed this Way, as much as any other Duty, by Men deſerting their own Flocks, and intruding in a diſorderly Manner into the Labours of other pious Miniſters, to withdraw their Flocks from them? And as great Dupes and Dunces as Mr. <hi>T.</hi> counts is, we challenge him, or any of his Party to reconcile ſuch Practices to Scripture-Rule, the Preſbyterian-Plan, or even to right Reaſon and Charity? But to return to the Matter in Hand; who doubts, but that in chuſing Paſtors as well as Wives, Men ſhould <hi>ſeek the beſt Gifts;</hi> but yet muſt we be chuſing every Day for ever, without any Regard to the Choice already made, and the Relation already contracted? Is it not
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:004792_0057_100DEEA7244EBD20"/>
our Duty, when bound to a Miniſter, as well as to a Wife, to ſtand to the Choice made, and to fulfil the reſpective Duties of that Relation? May not thoſe Gifts be beſt and fitteſt for me, which God in his Providence carves out for me, tho' they be not beſt in themſelves, or in my Eſteem and Conceit; and when Men ſtand related upon a ſolemn Choice, ſhould not all that are bound to an orderly Miniſter in an orderly Way, believe this, notwithſtanding corrupt Reaſon or Inclination ſuggeſt the contrary? For when Miniſters are but Inſtruments, what hath a more direct Tendency to anſwer or reach the deſigned End, than a careful and cloſe Obſervation of God's Inſtitutions in uſing Means and Inſtruments, without conſulting with Fleſh and Blood? That <hi>there is a Difference or variety of Gifts, and that Men ſhould be duly reſpected upon the Account of ſuperior Gifts,</hi> we own, but will it follow thence, that we are to contemn our own Miniſter, if he hath a Competency of Gifts, by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawing our Attendance upon his Miniſtry, any more than that a Man ſhould deſpiſe his own virtuous Wife, becauſe ſome fine Lady in the Town is more beautiful than ſhe? For is it not well known, that plain Preaching may be more edifying to the Vulgar than profound Doctrine, which may be more edifying to Men of greater Capacities? For is not a wooden Key that opens the Lock, better than a golden one that makes a fidling Din in the Wards, and yet confounds them? Is not ſound Scripture Doctrine the true Food of Souls, and what is truly edifying? And is not Truth, in her ſober homely Garb, more edifying than gaudy Error, ſpruced up with all the Fineries of the Scene or Stage, or bug-beared with all the Horns that can ſtick upon its hydratick Heads? And if Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Sermons be ſtripped of the Padlock of Pen and Inkhorn Terms, what Sermons are there preached among us, but what will more than equalize this Sermon of his, as well as Mr. <hi>W</hi>'s Sermons, for old Truth? And doth not ſound Matter edify better than ear-pleaſing empty Sounds? But how great ſoever Men's Gifts be, muſt not God carry on <hi>a Series of Miracles as long as there is a Series of true Converſion Work</hi> carried on in the World: why then ſhould Mr. <hi>T.</hi> count this unneceſſary, or the ſuppoſing this unreaſonable? How alien to the Matter in Hand is the Exam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>John the Baptiſt's Hearers, and thoſe of the Phariſees, coming to hear Chriſt, not only upon Week-Days, but upon Sabbath-Days, whom Chriſt reproved not?</hi> For may not a mean Capacity
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:004792_0057_100DEEA7244EBD20"/>
diſtinguiſh between the Maſter and the Servant, and between ordinary and extraordinary Times or Matters? For where was that Pariſh Church among the Phariſees, wherein the ſame Goſpel Doctrine which Chriſt preached, was preached in Purity? In what Part of the World was <hi>John the Baptiſt</hi>'s Pariſh? When hath Mr. <hi>T.</hi> or his Adherents, given as good Proofs of their being as much greater than their Brethren as Chriſt did to <hi>John?</hi> Might not <hi>John</hi> worſhip Chriſt without being guilty of Idolatry, as well as give him the Preference? But what ſort of Creatures are thoſe who put themſelves upon a Par with Chriſt in extraor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinary Matters? And is not Chriſt's <hi>particular Reſpect to John, and his taking him, with Peter and James, to Mount Tabor and Gethſamene,</hi> as little to the Purpoſe? For who was that ſtated Paſtor, unto whom theſe Diſciples were related, whoſe ſacred Adminiſtrations were deſerted, by their accompanying Chriſt?</p>
            <p n="2">2. Another Thing that is pleaded to be ſufficient Grounds to juſtify People to forſake their own Miniſter, and to go to hear others for ordinary, is, <hi>the Judgment and Inclination of People ballancing that Way.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before we come to lay down Queries, we ſhall premiſe a few Words: As to the Noiſe here made about <hi>binding Men againſt their Judgment and Inclination, to a particular Miniſter;</hi> if levelled againſt our Synod, it is entirely a falſe Charge, as we hinted already; for none are bound with us but by their own free and voluntary Choice and Conſent; all the Binding that can be pretended to be, is that we plead, that it is the Duty of the Members of a particular Congregation, who have a fixed Paſtor, to attend for ordinary upon his Miniſtry, while he is their orderly Miniſter.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> I. When it is Chriſt's Appointment, that every Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation ſhould have their own Paſtor, and every Paſtor his own Flock; how can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> have the Face to out-face the Truth ſo far, as to ſay, that obliging Church-Members to wait upon the Goſpel Adminiſtrations of their own Paſtor, <hi>is an unſcriptural Infringement on Chriſtian Liberty,</hi> unleſs he can prove that the Relation of Paſtor and People is an human Invention? Can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſay, that this is any more than Chriſt's eaſy Yoke? How terribly then doth Mr. <hi>T.</hi> miſrepreſent the Matter, when he ſaith, <hi>that it is a worſe Yoke than that of</hi> Rome <hi>itſelf?</hi> to prove which he quotes Dr. <hi>Voetius,</hi> who aſſerts, <hi>That even among Papiſts, as to hearing of Sermons, the People are not deprived of
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:004792_0058_100DEEA8DEA9BB40"/>
the Liberty of Choice.</hi> If the Account be true, whether or no one orthodox Proteſtant Miniſter, be not worth a Thouſand popiſh begging Friars with all their Trumpery? Suppoſe then, that the Pope allows the People a free Election or Choice of their own Paſtors, if this were true, are not Proteſtant Diſſenters fully as orthodox as he is in this Point? For hath not he Miſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>naries, but none of our Miniſters will cope with him, except Mr. <hi>T.</hi> will? For what elſe can we call Mr. <hi>F.</hi> who reſides with us this Winter? If the Pope allows People to chuſe a Paſtor to-day, and to reject him to morrow, upon the bare Plea of <hi>their own Judgment and Inclination,</hi> is it any Wonder that Proteſtants diſſent from Papiſts in this Point, when they differ in as material Ones beſides? For is it not the Pope's old Rule to People, <hi>Come you over to me in Ceremonials, and I will come over to you in Morals?</hi> And without we would go all the Way to the <hi>Delphic Oracle,</hi> we cannot expect a Scheme that will ſuit the Inclinations of the Generality better than his: Well, but will not we have as good Company, if we have the Vogue of all ſound Proteſtant Reformers on our Side, albeit Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſhould be ſo happy as to have the Pope on his? What ſort of an Aſpect is it when ſome of the Stars of the firſt Magnitude in this lower Orb, are in ſomething like a Conjunction with the Dragon's Tail, in the Points they diſſent from their Brethren? Hath not <hi>Rome</hi> been much abuſed, and Proteſtant Writers much miſtaken, if the News be true that the Proteſtant Yoke, even among Conformiſts, is worſe than the Romiſh Yoke? And may not Non-conformiſts ſpeak one Word more than they — in the Matter? All that we can ſay is, that we cannot wiſh any of our Fellow-Subjects as great an Evil, as to have the Trial of both; for was not it an unhappy Day when King <hi>Lucius</hi> bartered a Crown of Gold for a Crown of Thorns, by laying down his Scepter at the Feet of him that bore a Reed? But more Fury ſtill; for Mr. <hi>T.</hi> adds, <hi>It is a Yoke like that of</hi> Aegypt, <hi>which cruel</hi> Pharoah <hi>formed for the Necks of the oppreſſed</hi> Iſraelites, <hi>when he obliged them to make up their ſtated Taſk of Brick, but allowed them no Straw; ſo we muſt now grow in Grace and Knowledge, but in the mean Time, according to the Notion of ſome, we are confined from uſing the likelieſt Means to attain the End.</hi> Is not this an hard Caſe? But the Query is, whether the People's Taſk, or Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s Taſk is the greateſt, who was obliged to travel all the Way to <hi>Aegypt,</hi> to find an equal Yoke to the
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:004792_0058_100DEEA8DEA9BB40"/>
Goſpel-Yoke, but is it not ſon Comfort that he muſt not go further? for hath not he found one like it now? We never till now heard the Queſtion reſolved whether the Pope's or <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Yoke was the Heavieſt, but it would ſeem that Catholicks reckon <hi>Pharaoh</hi>'s Yoke much worſe; Why ſo? Is it becauſe they ſeel a Burden upon the Body more than double the Weight upon the Conſcience, becauſe the latter is tender? But when Mr. <hi>T.</hi> allows, that <hi>the ſame Word is preached in the Pariſh, that is preached out of the Pariſh Line;</hi> is it any Loſs that People are bereaved of Straw in their ſpiritual Food? If this be the Caſe, will not Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi>'s and <hi>Weſley</hi>'s Books, and this Sermon of Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſupply all our Pariſhes with more than enough of Straw, Hay and Stubble too, ſo that we have no Need to go out of the Pariſh Line to fetch more? And when the ſame Word is preached by an orthodox ſtated Paſtor without Straw, how are Men confined from the likelieſt Means, to attain Growth in Grace? But what if thro' Want or Weakneſs of Judgment, wavering Inſtability, Double-mindedneſs, Wantonneſs, Pride, Love of Novelties, itching Ears, Curioſity or deluſive Fancies, People are inclined not to hear ſound Doctrine, being like <hi>Iſrael</hi> of old, <hi>loving to wander, without refraining her Feet,</hi> Jer. 14.10. and to <hi>go after her Lovers, that gave her her Bread and her Water, her Wool and her Flax, her Oil and her Drink,</hi> Hoſ. 2.5. yea, to <hi>ſcatter her Ways unto Strangers under every green Tree,</hi> Jer. 3.13. Will it be the Part of the good Shepherd to ſuffer the Sheep to go aſtray, as oft and as long and as far as ſuch an Inclination leads them, or hath not God entruſted his Servants <hi>with a Rod</hi> to <hi>revenge all Diſobedience?</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.21. 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.6. Are not Sheep to follow their own Shepherds in what they follow Chriſt, and to obey their own Rulers in the Lord, ſtriving in the Strength of his Grace, to bring every Judgment, Thought and Inclination into Captivity, to the Obedience of Chriſt, praying that he may incline their Hearts to perform his Statutes always even unto the End, as knowing it to be both the Sin and the Puniſhment of the Back-ſlider <hi>to be filled with his own Ways?</hi> To conclude this, we would aſk, Whether bringing Religion to truckle to the Humours of the People, be not the ready Way to deſtroy Religion and the People? As for Inſtance, <hi>Cambyſes</hi> demanding of his Counſellors, Whether he might marry his Siſter by the Law of the Land? They an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwered, That they found no Law, that allowed a Brother to
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:004792_0059_100DEEABDDF40F70"/>
marry a Siſter; but one, that allowed the Kings of the <hi>Perſians</hi> to do as they liſt. What a poor Government would it have been, if all the <hi>Perſians</hi> had ſuch an Allowance?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Another Thing, which is ſuppoſed to afford Grounds for a Church Member to withdraw from his own proper Paſtor, is the Conceit or Hope Men may conceive <hi>of getting as good if not better Edification elſewhere.</hi> Here we are like to have ſome warm Work, if not a Battle. <hi>Page</hi> 21. Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſaith, <hi>If the great Ends of Hearing may be attained as well, and better, by Hearing of another Miniſter than our own; then I ſee not, why we ſhould be under a fatal Neceſſity of hearing him, I mean our Pariſh-Miniſter, perpetually, or generally.</hi> Is not this Argument as long as it is broad? For may not we ſay, If the great Ends of Hearing may be attained as well, if not better, by hearing our own Miniſter than another; then we ſee not, where is the Prudence, Piety, or Order, in forſaking our own Paſtor to go to hear another? Whether the commanded Duty, or the Neglect or Counter-acting of it, is fatal? Is the ſacred Relation between Miniſter and People ſuch an Atom, that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> cannot ſee it without a Microſcope? Is Men's ſolemn Choice, and the wiſe Diſpoſal of Providence, in bringing Men into ſuch a particular Relation to their Miniſter, a Nullity? Are Men's ſolemn Vows of attending upon their own Miniſter's Adminiſtrations, No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing? Is Chriſt's Inſtitution, which is the Foundation of par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Churches, and of the particular Relation between Paſtor and People, a meer Trifle? May not a purblind Man ſee, that this is ſome Reaſon, why Men ſhould ordinarily attend upon the Adminiſtrations of their ſtated Paſtor? Is it not ſome Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>front to ſay, in the open Parlour, that <hi>Doll is as good as my Lady;</hi> but muſt ſhe be better too? How then will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> prove, that ſtolen Bread is ſweeter than common, and that Men will thrive better by it? Mr. <hi>T.</hi> adds, <hi>What are, or ought to be the Ends of Hearing, but getting of Grace, and growing in it?</hi> Rom. 10.14. 1 Pet. 2.2. <hi>Anſ.</hi> Yea, and why may not glorifying God by our Obedience, as well as getting Communion with God, be as direct Ends as the former? Hath not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> lately con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended warmly with Mr. <hi>Gowell</hi> for aſſerting, that our own Good or Happineſs is our main End? What is the Reaſon that he now ſeems to change Sides, as if he had forgot his own Part of that Controverſy? Was Mr. <hi>T.</hi> aware, that it was an hard Matter to prove, that we glorify God by forſaking our own
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:004792_0059_100DEEABDDF40F70"/>
Aſſemblies? But will he tell us, whether he hath any of the Oil of Grace to ſell to or to beſtow upon his Hearers, any more than the Pariſh Miniſter? If not, what is this to the Purpoſe? But Mr. <hi>T.</hi> adds, <hi>Poor Babes like not dry Breaſts, and living Men like not dead Pools.</hi> But are not the Breaſts, if not of the Fathers, yet of the Mothers that begat them, as natural for Babes, as thoſe of a Stranger? Can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tell us in what Pariſh one may meet with more, or half as much of the Coloquintida of falſe Doctrine, than in Mr. <hi>W—d</hi>'s Books and this Sermon of his? When he doth this, may it not be time for ſuch Pariſhioners to cry out with the Sons of the Prophets, <hi>Death is in the Pot?</hi> Mr. <hi>T.</hi> adds, <hi>Well then, may not theſe Ends be obtained out of our Pariſh Line?</hi> So ſay we, may not theſe Ends be obtained within our Pariſh Line? Mr. <hi>T.</hi> proceeds, ſaying, <hi>Faith comes by hearing,</hi> Rom. 10. <hi>But the Apoſtle doesn't add your Pariſh Miniſter.</hi> So ſay we, the Apoſtle does not add an Itinerant, nor a begging Friar, nor a wandring Jew. What then? Is not the Pariſh Miniſter in Poſſeſſion, and if another enters into his Labours, ſhould not he ſhew his Patent or Call? Mr. <hi>T.</hi> adds, <hi>Is not the ſame Word preached out of the Pariſh?</hi> So ſay we, Is not the ſame Word preached in the Pariſh, and that to ſome better Purpoſe? Elſe, how could we correct Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s and <hi>W</hi>'s Divinity, who are but common Hearers, even tho' it were ſuppoſed, that we had ſome Help from the Pariſh Miniſter? Beſides, is not there ſome Odds between an orderly Paſtor and a vagabond Intruder, to diſpence Ordinances, if we have any Regard at all to our Bibles? Mr. <hi>T.</hi> adds, <hi>Is there any Reſtriction in the Promiſes of Bleſſing the Word to thoſe only, who keep within the Pariſh-Line ordinarily?</hi> We reply, Is there any Reſtriction of the Promiſes of Bleſſing the Word to thoſe only, who ordinarily go over the Pariſh-Line to hear? If there is, is not the Condition of the Sheep much better when they want, than when they have a Paſtor, if they have but a neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Miniſter? To what Purpoſe then ſhall Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s Pariſh keep him any longer? Mr. <hi>T.</hi> adds, <hi>If there be ſuch a Reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I have not yet met with it.</hi> Say you ſo; but can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſay, that he hath met with ſuch a Reſtriction on the other Side? But will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tell us where did he look for it, was it in the Promiſe only? If ſo, might not the Reſtriction be in the Precept added to the Promiſes? For is not the Bleſſing and Promiſe God's Part, and what Need was there that God ſhould
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:004792_0060_100DEEAE6242DFC0"/>
put Reſtrictions on himſelf? For might not he put Reſtrictions enough upon us, in Point of Duty, without putting the leaſt Reſtraint upon himſelf, in Point of Grace? Are our Choice of, our Vows and Relation to our own Paſtor, our Obligation to the relative Duties of this Relation, and Chriſt's Inſtitution of particular Churches, under the Care, Watch and Overſight of particular Paſtors, no Reſtriction upon the Paſtor's proper Flock, at leaſt ordinarily, to attend upon his ſacred Adminiſtrations? Here muſt not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> either own this to be God's Way, or ſay it is not? If he ſays it is not, how did he come under ſuch a Relation to his own Flock, and bring them under the Ties of ſuch a Relation to him? And if he had any Light ſince, to the contrary, how doth he continue in ſuch a Relation ſtill, as well as join in fixing others in the ſame? If he owns this to be God's Way, is not the Promiſe of Bleſſing to thoſe that keep God's Way in waiting upon him? <hi>Pſal.</hi> xxxvii. 34. Beſides, doth not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> plainly aſſert, with Reſpect <hi>to the promiſed Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to encourage us to Duty, that we have no more that a Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>adventure or Probability</hi> of obtaining it? If ſo, how clear muſt the Matter be, that the Promiſes of Bleſſing cannot be our Rule? For is not our Rule of Duty ſure and certain, if we do but hearken to it, without any Peradventure at all, ſo that, <hi>he that runs may read;</hi> yea, ſo plain, that way-faring Men, tho' Fools, ſhall not err therein? <hi>Iſai.</hi> 34.8. Muſt it not follow then, that how far ſoever the Promiſe is a Rule to us to direct our Courſe by it, ſo far it muſt needs be ſure and certain, not only in it ſelf, but alſo to us? How elſe can we obſerve it? Will Mr. <hi>T.</hi> therefore encourage People to deſert their proper Paſtors upon ſomething leſs than <hi>a Probability of benefiting elſewhere?</hi> For if we have but <hi>a Probability in the Way of Duty,</hi> muſt not we have leſs than that itſelf when we go out of it? But Mr. <hi>T.</hi> adds, <hi>Yea, I can affirm, that ſo far as Knowledge can be had in ſuch Caſes, I have known Perſons get ſaving Good to their Souls, by their hearing over the Pariſh Line; and this makes me earneſt in the Defence of it.</hi> Might not we eaſily affirm as much on the other Side, and have Numbers to join with us? But what ſignify Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s Affirmations or our Affirmations in religious Matters, when God's Word is the ſole Rule? Should not then <hi>Meſſrs. You ſay</hi> and <hi>I ſay,</hi> and <hi>Meſſrs. Experience</hi> and <hi>Feelings,</hi> inſtead of being pragmatical, in Silence hearken what ſaith the Lord, whoſe Word alone is authoritative and deciſive in the Point? If
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:004792_0060_100DEEAE6242DFC0"/>
therefore <hi>Mr. T.</hi> ſtands up in the Defence of the Practice of <hi>Croſſing the Pariſh Line,</hi> upon the ſandy Bottom of his own or others Affirmations and Experiences; have not we much more Reaſon to be earneſt in the Defence of Men's continuing in Church-Fellowſhip, without forſaking their own Aſſemblies diſorderly, upon the Foundation of <hi>God's Inſtitution?</hi> Heb. x. 25. For is it not vain and frivolous to the laſt Degree, in thoſe that own Scripture to be their ſole and perfect Rule, to plead ſuch Experiences for a Rule, which plainly thwart Scripture-Rule? But ſurely <hi>Mr. T.</hi>'s Heart ſtrangely failed him here, in that he pretends not to affirm the Matter poſitively, as to People's getting ſaving Good in his conteſted-for Way, but only with this Limitation, as far as Knowledge can be had in ſuch Caſes: Would not it look little enough in ſuch Miniſters as <hi>pretend not to know certainly, whether Chriſt be formed in the Hearts of their Hearers,</hi> to come off as lame as this? For how can <hi>Mr. T. take Comfort in what he knows not now?</hi> as he ſaith in <hi>pag.</hi> 12. How then can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> encourage People to deſert their own Miniſters upon ſuch a precarious Footing, in or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der to try a Remedy called <hi>Experimental Noſtrum,</hi> which Mr. <hi>T.</hi> recommends upon the bare Authority of his own Experience? For aught we know, hundreds have made Experiments of it in a Day; and yet, does not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> candidly own, that tho' he gueſſed it did good to many, yet he is not able to produce one unconteſtable Proof of its having done real good to one Soul? Who muſt anſwer for it, if it prove a Kill-Cure? Is not Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture Rule, which is tried ſeven Times, ſtamped with the divine Seal, recommended by a Cloud of inconteſtable Witneſſes, a far ſafer Rule, than any Rules framed out of the Experiences of as many Millions of fallible Men as there have Days elapſed ſince the Creation of Man upon Earth? Who then act more fillily or fooliſhly than thoſe, who take the bold Affirmations of a ſingle Perſon, upon the ſandy Footing of his probable Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riences, for their Rule in religious Matters, when it is evident, that the Practice encouraged by ſuch Experience, is directly oppoſite to what is required by divine Inſtitutions? What poor Arguings are thoſe, wherein there is neither proving nor hand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſome begging, nor yet yielding up the Caſe, but ſilly crowing over the Argument with half begging, and then ſummoning Mr. <hi>Experience,</hi> who is a purblind or half-eyed Gentleman, to fill the Room of a double Evidence, to witneſs a <hi>bold Peradventure,</hi>
               <pb n="120" facs="unknown:004792_0061_100DEEB185BBB278"/>
contradictory to Scripture Rule? O rare! What a Clock now? Is not it Two and Two, if not ſomething more? For if we get the leaſt Juſtice, have not we ſaved our Bail fairly, as well as entered a Demur in the Caſe, ſtanding fairly at the Mouth of the Demi-Cannon for all the Warmneſs of the Battle, Shoot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings and Huzza's? Can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> think, but that we have ſome <hi>Round-Heads ſtill,</hi> who are bold Fellows, who will ſtand up for Liberty and Property, according to the old Charter of Divine Inſtitution, for all the Noiſe, Puffings and Vapours of the <hi>hot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpur Chevaliers,</hi> for Supremacy and Prerogative, <hi>Diotrephes like,</hi> by calling their Neighbours <hi>Dupes, Dunces, and ſilly Fools, &amp;c?</hi> Further we grant, <hi>that Men ſhould have a due Regard to their Souls Edification,</hi> and that they ſhould not, by any means, chuſe any Miniſter, but one that is apt to teach, having a Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petency of Gifts, ſound in the Faith, and exemplary in his Life; and if afterwards he is found any way faulty, ſhould not they appear againſt him in the Way of regular Diſcipline, and get rid of him? If the Wife plays the Harlot, is it not better to give her a Bill of Divorce, than to keep her and pay her in her own Coin? For will not that make a Man as much a Rogue as ſhe is a Whore: And will one Sin mend another? If People have an orthodox, regular Miniſter, ought not they to attend upon his ſacred Adminiſtrations ordinarily, looking unto God for his Bleſſing upon his own Inſtitutions, waiting in Faith and Hope of it? If the Food be wholſome, and others are edified thereby, may not Men have greater Reaſon to look to their own Hearts and Ways, leſt the Fault be in themſelves and not in their Miniſters, which loudly calls for Humiliation and Amendment? For is it not evident, that the Reaſon of Men's not Profiting, is not always the Unſuitableneſs of the Miniſter's Gifts, nor his Want of Grace, nor the Want of his Exerciſe of them? For who can believe, but that <hi>Lot</hi> was earneſt with his Sons-in-Law; and yet, did not <hi>he ſeem to them as one that mocked?</hi> Was not Chriſt earneſt with <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> and yet, had not he Reaſon to complain, <hi>that</hi> Iſrael <hi>would not come to him, nor be gathered?</hi> What Sort of a Way of convin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cing Men of Sin is this; For is it not a plain Teaching Men <hi>to hide and palliate their Sins, like</hi> Adam, who ſaid, <hi>the Woman whom thou gaveſt to be with me, ſhe gave me of the Tree, and I did eat?</hi> Will it do, that Men blame and exclaim againſt their Miniſter, when they themſelves are in the Fault? For may
<pb n="121" facs="unknown:004792_0061_100DEEB185BBB278"/>
not Men's not Profiting, proceed from the Hearer's Want of Grace, or the Want of the due Exerciſe of it, or from his Neglect of Prayer for himſelf and his Miniſter, or from their coming to hear with Prejudice and Ill-will, or from Want of due Attendance upon the Word preached or Meditation upon it afterwards, or from Want of due Love and Regard to it, as it is the Word of God and not of Man, or from Love to No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velties and wanton Curioſity, or from vain Admiration of Men's Perſons and vain Fanglings, or from Want of Judgment, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted in an undue Regard unto the Dreſs and Manner of Delivery, more than the Matter delivered? Or may not Hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, many other ſuch like Ways, ſtand in the Way of their own Edification? And if it be ſo, that others, who are more conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>entious, reap real Benefit, by the divine Bleſſing, under the ſame Miniſtry; muſt not the Fault, in all likelihood, be their own, and not their Miniſter's? Beſides, is it not eaſy for Men to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain high Conceits of their reaping much Benefit, when in Reality, they loſe Ground inſtead of gaining it, by encompaſſing themſelves about with Sparks of their own Kindling? <hi>Iſa.</hi> l. 11. Did not the Church of <hi>Lacdicea</hi> both think and ſay, <hi>that ſhe was rich, and increaſed in Goods, and had need of Nothing?</hi> Can any of our Boaſters match her, with all their Skill, if her Declaration of her Experiences be Sterling, or even Currency? If any will ſay no, will they tell us, why not? And then may not we with Eaſe tell them, why the Declarations ſhould paſs only by Weights too? Do not many think they are bravely edified, when they are pleaſed and flattered, when in Reality it proves a Curſe unto them? <hi>Prov.</hi> xxvii. 14. Do not many think that they are edified, when they are encouraged in their Diſorders, or in their vain preſumptuous Hopes, by their being proclaimed Saints for their anarchical Practices? <hi>Iſa.</hi> xxx. 10, 11, Or may not Men think that they are edified, when they are confirmed in their fond but falſe Opinions, when they are diſpleaſed at Truth? 1 <hi>Kings</hi> xxii. 6, 7, 8. And may not others be edified in Reality, who are not ſenſible of it for the preſent, becauſe their Humours are croſſed? For doth not God often croſs his Hands to our Views, in giving the Succeſs, as well as <hi>Jacob</hi> did his, in bleſſing the two Sons of <hi>Joſeph?</hi> Was not young <hi>Hagar,</hi> in all Appearance, more likely to be fruitful than old <hi>Sarah</hi> with her dead Womb? But yet, what was got by croſſing the Pariſh-Line, but only <hi>a big mocking
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:004792_0062_100DEEB31D8CE160"/>
Iſhmael,</hi> who muſt be caſt out, to the creating of Grief of Heart inſtead of Comfort to <hi>Abraham?</hi> And was not <hi>Abraham</hi> obliged to return within the Pariſh-Line, before he could get the <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſed Seed,</hi> for all their Haſte and Combination to try the moſt as likely in Appearance, but improper Means? Was not <hi>Rachel</hi> as likely in Appearance to be fruitful as blear-eyed <hi>Leah,</hi> and had not the former the Love of her Huſband to boot? And yet was not the latter more fruitful, as well as proved the Mother of the promiſed Seed?</p>
            <p n="4">4. Another Thing, that is pleaded for a lawful Ground for People to deſert their own Miniſter, is, <hi>Their Opinion or Gueſs that their proper Paſtor is a natural Man:</hi> And this ſeems to be magnified above the reſt, by his aſſerting, that in this Caſe, <hi>it is both lawful and expedient to forſake the proper Paſtor.</hi> p. 22.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> I. Is it not notorious, that Enthuſiaſts have, in all Ages, branded the Orthodox, that oppoſed their enthuſiaſtick Notions, with the opprobrious Names of <hi>carnal Men, Literaliſts, Scribes and Phariſees,</hi> in order to amuſe the Vulgar, and to incenſe their blind Admirers againſt them? Was not this the Way the Phariſees took to blacken Chriſt's Character, by pretending to know, that he was a Sinner, a Glutton, a Drunkard, a Deceiver, a Traitor, a Conjurer, and what not? Was not this the Way their Brood, the falſe Apoſtles, took to blacken <hi>Paul</hi>'s Character, as may be ſeen in many Places, particularly in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 2.? <hi>But I beſeech you, that I may not be bold when I am preſent, with that Confidence wherewith I think to be bold againſt ſome which think of us, as if we walked according to the Fleſh.</hi> ver. 3. <hi>For tho' we walk in the Fleſh, we do not war after the Fleſh?</hi> Was not carnal <hi>Paul</hi> better than the glorious vain-boaſting falſe Apoſtles, who highly commended themſelves and one another, making fair ſhews <hi>in the Fleſh,</hi> in order to rent Congregations, and to draw the Members of them to their deluded Party? And did not ſuch Deceits prove very <hi>bewitching</hi> to the <hi>Galatians? Gal.</hi> iii. 1. But how did they prove this Charge againſt <hi>Paul?</hi> Doth it not ſeem that one Proof was his aſſerting his miniſterial Authority, whence he was concluded to be maſterly, becauſe he commanded People to obey their own Rulers in the Lord, and warn'd Men not to forſake their own Aſſemblies, and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed diſorderly Intruders, together with their corrupt Doctrines and Practices, therefore he was carnal? What but this makes the Apoſtle to reply, in the 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> x. 8. <hi>But tho' I ſhould boaſt
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:004792_0062_100DEEB31D8CE160"/>
ſomewhat more of my Authority (which the Lord hath given us for Edification and not for Deſtruction) I ſhould not be aſhamed: q. d.</hi> Will this prove me a carnal Man? But what had the falſe Apoſtles to ſay more, to prove that <hi>Paul</hi> was carnal? May we not ſee in Verſe the 10th, <hi>For his Letters (ſay they) are weighty and powerful?</hi> Will this do him any Service? How can it, for is not the Anſwer ready? Unconverted Miniſters are crafty Foxes, there is ſtill Enmity in their Hearts to the Seed of the Woman, tho' it is better poliſhed in others with Wit and Rhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torick, and guilded over with the ſpecious Names of Zeal, Fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>delity, Peace, good Order and Unity? <hi>page</hi> 5—9. What more to prove <hi>Paul</hi> carnal, <hi>But his bodily Preſence is weak?</hi> Was not this a home Thruſt? For how could he preach with Authority, who had no Braſs in his Countenance to make him Fool-hardy? Well, but what more, <hi>His Speech is contemptible?</hi> What can be ſaid more? For may not this big Word in the Indictment ſerve for a Category to place a whole Train of bad Epithets, <hi>viz.</hi> For if there was Room to call <hi>Paul</hi>'s Preaching contemptible, might not they call it <hi>ſoft, ſelfiſh, cowardly, dry, ſapleſs, freezing, dead as a Stone, yea, and prating too?</hi> And who but Dupes and Dunces would wait to hear him? But for all this, will not Truth be Truth ſtill, and Error, Error? Will calling honeſt Men <hi>Knaves,</hi> prove them to be ſo, or the contrary? But is it not too ſoon yet to judge poſitively, who, among orderly Profeſſors, are carnal, or who converted?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> II. Do not all Mr. <hi>T</hi>'s Reaſonings here ſuppoſe, That a graceleſs Miniſter may be known by his Hearers, altho' both in Doctrine and Diſcipline he be blameleſs, excepting human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firmities, which are conſiſtent with true Grace? For if he be blemiſhed in Doctrine or Character, ſhould not he be proſecuted according to Merit, that ſo the Evil might be taken away from among them? But if he be not blemiſhed either in Doctrine or Converſation, is it not impoſſible for Men to know his Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſſneſs? Yea, is it not raſh judging, to pronounce him Grace<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs? How then can his Graceleſſneſs, which cannot be proved, be a ſufficient Reaſon to forſake his Miniſtry? Would not ſuch Actings be a plain caſting off Scripture from being a Rule? Is it ſafe for Men to diſſolve a ſacred Relation, or to neglect its reſpective Duties, upon an uncertain Gueſs or groundleſs Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſe, which, for aught they know, may be a foul Miſtake and the Fruit of meer Prejudice? Is it not bold Work <hi>to kick</hi> in
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:004792_0063_100DEEB543973850"/>
the Dark <hi>againſt the Pricks?</hi> If any will ſay, he is confident he judges right, in judging his Miniſter carnal; was not <hi>Paul</hi> as confident, when in Zeal he perſecuted the Church, as any ſuch can be? <hi>Acts</hi> xxvi. 9. Beſides, we would aſk ſuch a one, whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther or no he was not once as confident, that his Miniſter was a gracious Man? how elſe could he give him a Call? And do not many as judicious and conſcientious Chriſtians as he, judge him to be ſo ſtill? Is it not a fundamental Error in Diſcipline, to make meer Gueſſes about Men's ſecret State towards God, the Foundation of Judgment, in paſſing any Church Cenſures upon them? And can any be deprived of a Place or Privilege in the Church, without juſt Grounds for a Cenſure? And if the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation between Paſtor and Flock is to be diſſolved, upon every private Surmiſe or Gueſs in a Man's own Breaſt, is not every Member to be ſole Judge in his own Cauſe? And ſo, is not the Church a Society that is wholly without any Bands? How then can our <hi>Jeruſalem be ſaid, to be builded as a City that is compact together? Pſal.</hi> cxxii. 3. We appeal to all Church Members, how will they like it, if, upon ſuch Encouragements, they break off from their preſent, and join with ſuch Miniſters as call themſelves Spiritual Men, if afterwards they are debarred of their religious Privileges, without any Charge proven againſt their Principles or Practices, upon meer Gueſſes of their being carnal Men, as they are taught to ſerve their preſent Miniſters? Will it not be full Time then, to think of ſome new Community again? Yea, we would aſk, how would Congregations like it, if the preſent Miniſters would forſake and leave them, for no other Reaſon but a blind Gueſs of their being carnal Men; or ſaying, that they judge they would be more edifying elſewhere; or upon pleading their own Inclination to remove from them, which they may eaſily do, upon a better Encouragement offered elſewhere, if all other Shifts fail? Can the Miniſter be tied faſter to the Flock, than the Flock are to him? Conſcience, ſpeak! When therefore it is God's Appointment, that every Congregation ſhould have their own Paſtor, and every Paſtor his own Flock? When the Relation is mutual, ought not their Love, Reſpect and Aſſiſtance to each other, to be mutual? And ought not they to be ſtudious, wary and careful how to behave to each other in that Relation, in all Reſpects, in ſuch a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as may be conducive to make and continue them mutual Bleſſings and Comforts to each other; and to watch againſt all

glaring Temptations, that Satan or his Inſtruments, whether by <hi>transforming himſelf into an Angel of Light</hi> or otherwiſe, may caſt in their Way, to alienate their Affections from each other, or to neglect their reſpective Duties to each other, as they are ſeverally called to act a proper Part, in teaching and being taught, in ruling and obeying, in adminiſtring Goſpel-Ordinan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces and in waiting upon God in the Uſe of Ordinances admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtred, in Obedience to Chriſt, in Faith and Hope of his Bleſſing upon his own Inſtitutions? For how can we in Faith expect, that thoſe <hi>who watch over our Souls, can give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count with Joy and not with Grief,</hi> if their Flocks do not obey them in the Lord? And if we grieve them, by walking diſorder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, by abſenting ourſelves from ſacred Adminiſtrations, when purely and regularly adminiſtred by them, can we expect, <hi>that this will be profitable to us,</hi> when God's Word plainly tells us the contrary? <hi>Heb.</hi> xiii. 17. Will any tell us, how we may be ſaid <hi>to eſteem them highly for their Works Sake, who labour among us, and are over us in the Lord,</hi> as we are commanded in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> v. 12, 13. if we reject their Admonitions, which are agreeable to Scripture Rule, and hearken to ſuch Inſtructions which are contrary to it, and therefore <hi>cauſe us to err;</hi> or if we neglect their Adminiſtrations, tho' gracious Miniſters, upon a meer Conceit that others are more <hi>gifted</hi> than them, when it plainly appears, upon a Review of the Writings of the admired Strangers, that they are not ſound in their Doctrine, beſides their anarchical Practices? Do we <hi>eſteem them highly for their Works Sake,</hi> when we either reproach them ourſelves, or elſe take up the Reproaches of others, who ſlander orthodox and orderly Miniſters with the black Characters of <hi>carnal Men</hi> and Hypocrites, when neither they nor we can prove the Charge, nor make regular Attempts that Way? Ought we not to be very tender of their Reputations, whoſe Faithfulneſs for God will provoke Satan and his Inſtruments, to make their Characters the Butt of their malicious, poiſonous Arrows of Reproaches and falſe Reports? Do we ſhew our <hi>high Eſteem</hi> of them, <hi>by ſtudying to be at Peace among ourſelves,</hi> when we cry them down and others up, without being able to give any ſolid Reaſon for either, and by running away from them in a diſorderly Way, like wandring Sheep after Straglers; or when we encourage and incenſe others againſt them, and to forſake them too, meerly becauſe they bear a faithful Witneſs <hi>againſt the Errors and Diſorders of

the Times?</hi> Where is the <hi>high Eſteem</hi> of them in Love, when we entertain a vain Conceit, that a more unſound Doctrine, preached by diſorderly Straglers, will edify us better, than more ſound and wholſome Doctrine, preached by our own Paſtors? Where is the <hi>high Eſteem</hi> of them in Love, if we not only give Way to our perverſe Inclinations to lead us into Diſorders and Contempt of Goſpel Order, but alſo plead ſuch Inclinations for ſufficient Reaſons to juſtify our forſaking their regular Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miniſtrations, and our flocking to and after others, who walk diſorderly? Is it not our plain Duty <hi>to withdraw from every Brother that walketh diſorderly,</hi> as we are taught in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> iii. 6? And can that Aſſembly be orderly, whoſe Teacher is an Intruder, or obſerves not the Goſpel Rules eſtabliſhed in our Communities, abſolutely requiſite to preſerve Purity, Peace and Goſpel Order?

            <p n="1">1. Who forſake their own Charges, in order to make diſorderly Intruſions into the Labours of others; was not this the Trick of the falſe Apoſtles, and does not <hi>Paul</hi> reflect upon ſuch Practices as unbecoming and rude? 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10.15, 16.</p>

For tho' we do not deſire in the leaſt to plead for an unconverted Miniſtry, and we cannot be ſo uncharitable as to think that any of our Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gations, or the Members thereof, ever knowingly choſe an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>converted Miniſter, or thought the better of any Man for being unconverted; yet we would have Mr. <hi>T.</hi> to conſider, whether or no condemning orthodox and exemplary Miniſters for carnal, meerly for <hi>Want of Succeſs,</hi> be not ſuch a crooked Rule as may lead Men to <hi>ſpeak Evil of Dignities?</hi> as we have it in <hi>Jude</hi> 8.

Was not Chriſt incomparably more excellent than all his Apoſtles, both for Gifts and Grace; and yet was not their Miniſtry more ſucceſsful than his? For where do we read that Chriſt at one Sermon converted his <hi>three Thouſand Souls,</hi> as we do of <hi>Peter</hi>'s Sermon in <hi>Acts</hi> 2.41.? But who of the Sons of Wiſdom would venture to draw the monſtrous Concluſion, which would natively flow here-from by Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s crooked Rule?

When therefore the Relation of Paſtor and People is ſuch a ſolemn Tie, founded upon a Divine Inſtitution, confirmed by mutual ſolemn and publick Vows, made before God and many Witneſſes; how inconſiſtent is it with Reaſon and Religion to aſſert, that it is in the Power of Paſtor or Flock, to diſſolve the Obligations of ſaid Relation <hi>upon meer Conceits, Surmiſes or Inclinations in the Breaſts of either Party?</hi> How can Jeſuits trifle worſe with ſolemn Contracts, than Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſeems to do here? For muſt not we have ſomething like the old Diſtinction for an Oil-ſalvo, if this Scheme takes place, <hi>I have ſworn with the Tongue, but with the Heart I have ſworn nothing at all?</hi> We think we durſt appeal to Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s own Conſcience, if he were thus deſerted by his own People (and as high as his Tide is, may not an Ebb follow?) whether he would not in his Heart diſapprove the Practice, whether he would ſpeak of it or no? Yea, would not all Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s Arguments then loſe their preſent Force, and would it not be <hi>Hackelon</hi>'s Cow, or another Man's matter? For doth not this mutual Relation of Paſtor and Flock imply a mutual Contract or Covenant? and to allow People the above unbounded Latitude, what is it but to encourage the Breach of that ſacred Contract or Covenant which this Relation implies? Yea, is not it encouraging Men <hi>after Vows to make Enquiry,</hi> contrary to <hi>Prov.</hi> 20.25.?

us to oppoſe Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and <hi>Wd.'s</hi> new Scheme? But as for the other Objections, <hi>viz.</hi> 1. <hi>That ſuch a diſorderly deſerting of Men's ſtated Paſtors, will cauſe Heats and Contentions among People.</hi> 2. <hi>That ſuch a Practice is condemned as carnal in</hi> 1 Cor. 1.12.3. <hi>That this Practice will grieve the Pariſh Miniſter.</hi> 4. <hi>That it is again condemned by</hi> Paul, <hi>who aſſerts, that</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Apollos <hi>are Nothing.</hi> 5. <hi>That by ſuch Practice People go out of God's Way,</hi> &amp;c. Before we come to ſpeak particularly to each Objection, we ſhall propoſe one or two general Queries.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> I. Do not all Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s Anſwers to theſe Objections plainly ſuppoſe, that the Members of particular Congregations ſtand in as great an Indifferency, and that juſtly, to hear their own choſen and ſtated Paſtor, to whom they ſtand related, as any other Miniſter, whom they pleaſe to apply to? But if the Matter were really ſo, what ſerves the paſtoral Relation for? Is it not contracted in vain, at leaſt to no good Purpoſe? For if the Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers of a particular Congregation are no more obliged to attend upon their own Paſtor's miniſterial Adminiſtrations, than thoſe of a Stranger, who comes any how in their Way; will it not follow, that the Miniſter is no more obliged to ſerve his own People than any others? And if ſo, will it not be Time to ſound a Retreat, <hi>Return ye every Man to his Tent,</hi> wander ye Shepherds, ſcatter ye Sheep, and let every Man ſhift for him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf? And can the Devil deſire better Advocates, than ſuch as ſay, that no Man is in Brother's Keeper? And ſo inſtead of <hi>Wo to him that is alone,</hi> muſt not he be pronounced the happy Man? For he breaketh no Bonds, <hi>and if he falleth,</hi> ſhall not he lie down as long as he pleaſeth? For who will give him the unwelcome Diſturbance of <hi>helping him up?</hi> And ſo was it not a brave Time, when there <hi>was no King in Iſrael?</hi> For had not Men then full Liberty, to <hi>do what ſeem<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>d good in their own Eyes,</hi> as their Inclinations prompted them? And ſo, inſtead of calling the Sheep that were without a Shepherd, to lament, might not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> agreeably to the Strain of his Application here, raiſe an Uſe of Conſolation, and pronounce them an happy People, both upon the Account of the Bereavement, and alſo upon the Account of their Opportunity of getting a non-ſuch Paſtor, who upon hearing their Declarations, would preſently read their Hearts, and tell them Dreams as faſt as they could tell him Falſhoods?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> II. To put the Matter in a fair Light; we will ſuppoſe two Congregations in a City, both vacant at the ſame Time, one
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:004792_0067_100DEFF075B2DB50"/>
of which in ſome Time obtains a Miniſter ſettled and fixed among them as their Paſtor, to the good Liking of the whole Congregation; we will again ſuppoſe, that the other Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation ſome Time after, alſo gets a Miniſter to ſettle among them to be their Paſtor, which laſt Miniſter is viſibly to all Appearance ſuperiour to the firſt in Gifts and Accompliſhments; now we would aſk, Whether the Superiority of the Gifts in the ſecond Miniſter, would be a juſt Reaſon for the other Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation to leave their own Miniſter, that is, merely becauſe the other Miniſter excells him in Gifts, or their imbibing a Conceit that they ſhall be better edified elſewhere, while in the mean Time they cannot charge their own Miniſter with any Blemiſhes in Doctrine or Converſation, and his Gifts are what they were ſatisfied with, and gladly took up with at firſt? If ſo, would not this be to cenſure, yea in Effect to depoſe a faithful ſufficient Miniſter of the Goſpel, yea to caſhier him, becauſe the ſovereign God hath thought fit to give a greater Meaſure of Gifts to another? And if People act thus, may not we bid farewel to all good Order, Relations, Obligations and Duties between Paſtor and People in the Church of God? And ſo, tho' the Scripture ſaith, that God is a God of Order in all the Churches of his Saints; is not the Church of Chriſt by ſuch deforming Principles, repreſented more bandleſs, confuſed, and liker a <hi>Babel</hi> than any Society in the World? For if Matters be thus, will it not follow, that when a Miniſter is invited or called to fix as a Paſtor among a People, the true Meaning and Engliſh of the People calling that Miniſter, is no more than this, <hi>viz. We are willing and contract to receive you as our Paſtor now, but with this Reſervation, that as ſoon as we or any of us can get an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity of a better, we will be no longer bound to you, altho' we ſhould have no Fault to lay to your Charge?</hi> Is all the reſt <hi>Iriſh?</hi> And if this be rational, orderly, diſcreet and becoming the Piety of the Church, or the Dignity of the miniſterial Character, let Reaſon judge. And finally, we would aſk, whether the Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter hath not as great a Liberty to leave his Congregation, or any part of them? If ſo, where is there any Obligation or paſtoral Relation between them? And is not the fixing of a Paſtor in a Place a meer Notion? If not, will it not follow, that relative Obligations are not reciprocal and mutual? And is not this repugnant to the common Senſe of Mankind?</p>

Tho' we allow <hi>Men ſhould ſeek the greater Good;</hi> yet we would aſk, Whether this greater Good be moſt likely to be obtained in the Way of God's Appointment, and in the Uſe of regular and not irregular Means? Or whether the Notion that ſtolen Bread is ſweet, be a true or a falſe Notion? Or to uſe Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s own Phraſe, <hi>Doth not he act like a Fool,</hi> who forſakes his own chaſte Wife. in Hopes of getting more Pleaſure in the Embraces of a Strumpet?</p>

Doth not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> teach Church-Members the Knack of treating their own Paſtors, <hi>as Potiphar's Wife ſerved Joſeph,</hi> by aſſerting that the Plea of their not profiting under their Miniſtry, is a juſt Cauſe to forſake them; whereas when the Miniſter is pious, orthodox and regular, ſo that others profit by his Miniſtry, is not there a great Probability, if not ſomething more, that the Fault may be at their own Door, and not at their Miniſter's?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Qu.</hi> IV. Who can thoſe Prae-Adamites be among Proteſtants, <hi>That confine Oppoſition and Diviſion, as following upon living God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs and ſucceſsful Preaching,</hi> if thereby is meant the Preaching of Truth and the Exerciſes of true Piety, <hi>to the firſt Ages of Chriſtianity?</hi> For have not all the Oppoſitions and Diviſions between Proteſtants and Papiſts, as well as many others, ariſen ſince? And if there be no ſuch Men in the Proteſtant World, is not there good Reaſon <hi>to fear, that ſuch neither know them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves nor the Goſpel?</hi> If there be ſuch Men, let Mr. <hi>T.</hi> point them out; for may not a ſmall Part of the Hiſtory of latter Ages ſoon confound ſuch a brainleſs Opinion, before it hath Time to hatch, even tho' it were placed ſo high as the Eagle's Eggs in <hi>Jupiter</hi>'s royal Lap, to breed Fables to fill the Pulpit?</p>

maſked Hypocrites in the viſible Church,</hi> is readily granted: But yet we would aſk Mr. <hi>T.</hi> whether he hath found out a ſpecifick Preſervative to ward off this Mixture? Or hath he found a Mould to caſt a true Touch-Stone, to point out the cloſe Hy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pocrite, while he keeps on his religious Maſk? Or is there any Body wiſer than him, that ſaid, <hi>Let both grow together until the Harveſt, leſt while ye gather up the Tares, ye root up alſo the Wheat with them? Matth.</hi> xiii. 29, 30.

For may not the Hypocrite think as highly and ſpeak as vauntingly of himſelf and his Attainments and Comforts, ſo that the true Chriſtian, tho' as eminent as <hi>Paul,</hi> dare not compare with him in ſuch Matters, if his Words paſs for Sterling, be<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Offender, there may at leaſt be a good Degree of <hi>Harmony.</hi> But can it be expected, that a <hi>perfect Harmony</hi> is attainable in the viſible Church, where their is not only a Mixture of <hi>Tares and Wheat,</hi> but where the Wheat hath <hi>Straw and Chaff,</hi> ſo that no Member is at a <hi>perfect Harmony</hi> with itſelf? Further, may not true Grace, particularly Charity, do Wonders, in bear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing what is ſufferable; as well as peeviſh Ill-Nature will, in its Way, do Wonders too, by making Mountains of Mole-Hills and Beams of Straws or Sun-Beams? But Mr. <hi>T.</hi> aſks, <hi>Can Light dwell with Darkneſs?</hi> We reply in another Query, Is it not good Advice to him that doubts the Poſſiblity of that, to feel his own Forehead well? And if that doth not reſolve him, ſhould not he knock and call loudly, <hi>Who is within there,</hi> till Somebody anſwers? If that will not do, may not he make ſome further Tryal in the Matter, by getting a proven Pair of Spectacles, to read Mr. <hi>W.</hi>'s Books, and this Sermon of Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s? For when every Member of the viſible Church hath Light and Darkneſs in himſelf, is it any Wonder, that an Houſe or a Field can hold its Full of ſuch Creatures, that have both Light and Darkneſs in them? For what will hinder this, unleſs ſome ſmoky, fiery, conceity Zealots get among the Crowd, to ſound a ſtinking Trumpet, like that in <hi>Iſa.</hi> lxv. 5. <hi>Stand by thyſelf, come not near me, for I am holier than thou?</hi> If it comes to this once, muſt not the honeſt Man make Room and give Place to the towring Hypocrite; or be in Danger of either being choak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with the Smoke, or burnt with the Fire of blazing Sparks?</p>

               <hi>Qu.</hi> VII. Whereas Mr. <hi>T.</hi> frankly owns, <hi>That undoubtedly it is a great Duty, to avoid juſt Cauſe of Offence to any</hi> Right well; we would then aſk Mr. <hi>T.</hi> Is the <hi>Pariſh-Miniſter Some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>body,</hi> or is he only Mr. <hi>No-Body?</hi> For, is it not juſt Cauſe of Offence to ſuch, to hear his own Hearers cenſuring and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning him for <hi>a carnal Man,</hi> when orthodox and orderly, excepting only human Infirmities, which muſt be excepted in the beſt here? Is it not a juſt Offence to a pious faithful Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, to be ſlighted and forſaken by his own Flock, upon the Account of their imbibing a Notion, true or falſe, upon a ſlender Trial, that ſome diſorderly Stragler is <hi>more gifted</hi> than he; when, to more judicious Hearers, the latter is no more than a <hi>tinkling Cymbal,</hi> that gives an <hi>uncertain Sound;</hi> and, for aught that can be proven, may be a meer Cheat for all the Crack? Is it not juſt Cauſe of Offence to an orthodox Miniſter,
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:004792_0069_100DEFF541CA9288"/>
to hear his People ſay and plead, that they are <hi>better edified elſewhere,</hi> than by his Miniſtry? when it can be proven, that his Doctrine is <hi>ſound Speech that cannot be condemned;</hi> when, at the ſame Time, the Writings of the much admired Preachers are a meer Hotch-Potch of Truth and Error; yea, and even Void of Common Senſe in many Places? Or elſe, let us be put to the Proof. Is it not a juſt Cauſe of Offence to a faithful Miniſter, who hath for a long Seaſon preached the Goſpel in Purity to his Flock, to ſee his Hearers running after Errors and Erroriſts, and forſaking better Food; yea, ſo far from loving the Truth, that they <hi>cannot endure ſound Doctrine,</hi> without ſpurning at it? Is it not juſt Cauſe of Offence to the Pariſh Miniſter, to hear his own Flock pleading for Liberty to deſert him, upon the bare Propoſal of <hi>their Inclinations,</hi> right or wrong, to do ſo; or it may be deſerting him without ſo much as acquainting him therewith? Is it not juſt Cauſe of Offence to the <hi>Pariſh Miniſter,</hi> when requiring no Obedience but Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formity to God's Commands, to have his wholſome Exhortati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons neglected and deſpiſed, inſtead of being obeyed; when the Encouragers of Diſorders are hearkened to with Readineſs? May not ſuch and the like Appearances of the Want of Love to Truth and Order, as well as of Diſregard to Chriſt's Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, and their own real Good, juſtly grieve a pious Paſtor, who weighs the Matter right, when he ſees a likely Congre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation once, in a likely Way to ſcatter and to break to Pieces, after all his Pains to gather and keep them together, meerly for Want of Men's Studying to be quiet, and to do their own Buſineſs, as we are taught in 1 <hi>Theſſ.</hi> iv. 11? And if what Mr. <hi>T,</hi> ſaith, <hi>page</hi> 27. that <hi>it is but few that have got any ſpiritual Reliſh;</hi> may it not be juſtly feared, by his own Rule, that the Doctrine, which is admired and flocked to by the Crowds of all Sorts, is none of the beſt? And can Mr. <hi>T.</hi> tell us, why may not the Want of this <hi>ſpiritual Reliſh,</hi> incline Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to forſake the wholſome Doctrine of the Pariſh Miniſter? How then can it be a ſafe Rule, to give Way to Inclinations to ſway us in ſuch Matters, contrary to our own Vows and Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture?</p>
            <p>Qu. VIII. Whereas Mr. <hi>T.</hi> adds, <hi>That it is highly neceſſary, that pious Souls ſhould maintain Union and Harmony among them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, notwithſtanding of their different Opinions in leſſer Things. And, no doubt, this is the Drift of the many Exhortations we have
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:004792_0069_100DEFF541CA9288"/>
to Peace and Unity in Scripture.</hi> Well then, ſhould not pious Miniſters write good Patterns, in being ſtudious to maintain Union and Harmony among themſelves too? For what but the Want of this among the Miniſters, is the Cauſe of all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion among the People? And are not the Things wherein Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and his Party differ from the Reſt of the Miniſters of our Synod, as far as hath yet openly appeared in their Debates, Things of a leſſer Nature, whatever this new Confuſion may breed? How then doth Mr. <hi>T.</hi> follow his own Preſcriptions here? For can he think, that his diviſive anarchical Methods of ſtriving to make Rents and Factions, are the proper Methods to maintain Union and Harmony? Can any ſerious Chriſtian think, that Mr. <hi>T.</hi> and his Party would like it well, if their Brethren, who are at ſome Difference with them, ſhould be as induſtrious in their Bounds, as they have been elſewhere, to withdraw their Hearers from them, and to diſturb their Peace and Order? Or if they ſhould approve of ſuch Methods, would it not argue, that they had not any great Regard for the Souls of their Flock? If the Meaning of this be, that this Union and Harmony is only to be maintained with their own Partizans; as it ſeems to be, if we obſerve the Conduct, towards others, of a Knot of Gentlemen, who ſet up their own Party for the only true Catholicks or ſpiritual Men: If this be the Intent, is not the Law of the right Phariſee, a Popiſh Cut? For did not the former teach Men, <hi>thou ſhalt love thy Neighbour and hate thine Enemy? Matth.</hi> v. 43. And did not the latter teach Men, <hi>that no Faith is to be kept with Hereticks?</hi> But doth not Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture teach us, that there is a Peace and Unity that we are to cultivate with all Men as much as poſſible, much more with all Proteſtants of different Denominations, and much more with thoſe in our own Dominions than thoſe in <hi>Moravia?</hi> And why may not there be Peace and Unity, in ſome Reſpects, ſingular, which we are to cultivate with thoſe of our Denomination or Society, without being Guilty of Bigotry? And ſeeing Mr. <hi>T.</hi> on this Head, mentions <hi>the Unity of the Legion of Devils in one Man, and of</hi> Ahab's <hi>falſe Prophets, which were four Hundred Daubers, &amp;c.</hi> in order to caſt Contempt on the Pariſh-Miniſters; we would aſk, what Sort of an Union and Harmony there is between him, and Mr. <hi>Whitefield</hi> and <hi>Weſley,</hi> when the Writings of the former of the two laſt, is a motley Mixture of Truth and Error, Popery and Proteſtantiſm, <hi>Antinomianiſm, Armini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aniſm,

Calviniſm</hi> and <hi>Enthuſiaſm,</hi> and thoſe of the latter pure <hi>Arminianiſm,</hi> as far as hath, as yet, appeared? Who then are the Daubers and moderate Men, as to fundamental Truths and Goſpel-Order? Or are any Daubers better, becauſe of their Harping upon different Strings to confound Truth and Order? Or will the <hi>Majority's being of a Side</hi> now hallow all any more than formerly?</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>ſecond</hi> and <hi>fourth</hi> Objection, becauſe they ſeem to coincide, we place them together, <hi>viz. That ſuch a Practice here preſſed to, is like that of the factious</hi> Corinthians, <hi>who ſaid, I am of</hi> Paul, <hi>and I am of</hi> Apollos, <hi>which the Apoſtle condemns as carnal, becauſe</hi> Paul <hi>and</hi> Apollos <hi>were Nothing.</hi>

And if they are faithful, can we give away to another their juſt Due? And is not this done, if we neglect to attend upon their Miniſtry ordinarily? For whether we confeſs it or no, doth not the Practice prove a Slight and Undervalue in the Matter? Yea, let it be granted, that Members of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregations may, without Offence, take their Liberty to go to hear other neighbouring, orderly Miniſters, or a Stranger that comes in an orderly Manner, occaſionally, and at Seaſons: Yet, doth not the Caſe alter, when Men come in a diſorderly, intru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Manner, to make Parties, ſetting up Threſhold againſt Threſhold, and Altar againſt Altar, preſſing People to forſake their own ſtated orderly Paſtors, upon trivial Excuſes and Sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes; and abuſing ſuch as cleave to their own Paſtors with op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>probrious Names of <hi>Dupes and Dunces, &amp;c.</hi> when Men ſend their Miſſionaries, induſtriouſly to foment and keep up Factions and Diviſions, and when Men labour to caſt Contempt and Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dain upon other Miniſters, by Carnalizing and Phariſizing them meerly for oppoſing Errors and Diſorders? Doth not Mr. <hi>T.</hi> plainly yield up the Conteſt here, when he ſaith, <hi>That the Apoſtle, in the aforeſaid Places, reproves an exceſſive Love to, or Admiration of particular Miniſters, accompanied with a ſinful Contention, Slighting and Diſdaining of others, who are truly godly, and with Sect-making?</hi> If this then be not the Caſe now, we

When <hi>Paul and Apollos</hi> preached the ſame Goſpel equally pure, was it not a ſinful Idolizing of the Inſtrument, to ſay, that the one preaches edifyingly, and that the other did not? And if the Caſe were the ſame now, as to the Paſtor and Itinerant, would it not deſerve the ſame Cenſure? But in Caſe that it can be proven, that many of our ſtated Paſtors, who are deſpiſed, preach the Goſpel more orthodoxly than ſome Itine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rants, whoſe Doctrine is heterodox in many weighty Points of Doctrine; who can believe, but that the Notion ſome entertain, of their getting greater Good by a falſe Doctrine than they might get by a true one, if the Fault be not their own, can be any thing elſe but a meer Fiction and Deluſion?</p>

Can any Man, upon Scripture Grounds, think, that a diſorderly breaking off from an orderly Paſtor, upon the Grounds <hi>Mr. T.</hi> here lays down, in order to join elſewhere, is ſuch a Sign of Grace or Converſion, as will afford Comfort upon a Sick or Death Bed?

Is it any Proof of this, that when Men before made an orthodox Profeſſion of Truth, and that with ſeeming Love to it and Zeal for it, that they now aſſert Errors as faſt wi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

Who can believe that Men are better edified, when thoſe that appeared Sons of Peace, turn factious and contentious; when thoſe that ſeemed meek and humble, do now delight in proud, auſtere Cenſoriouſneſs, and black-mouthed Barking; when thoſe that before ſpoke well, do now ſpeak evil of Dignities; when thoſe that before waited duly at the Poſts of God's Gates, are ſeldom ſeen to wait there, but when their Idol is there; when thoſe that before ſeemingly took Delight in hearing a Goſpel-Sermon, do now in ſome Places mutter becauſe their Miniſter quotes too many Scripture-Proofs in his Sermon, counting that a Quotation or two in a Sermon is full enough; and therefore how can Goſpel Miniſters expect to be reſpected, when the Goſpel itſelf is deſpiſed? When ſuch and the like Fruits appear, is it any raſh Judging to judge that ſuch deceive themſelves, who think they increaſe in Grace, who are viſibly turned from the ſolid Exerciſes of Religion, to crooked Ways and vain Janglings?</p>

Whereas Mr. <hi>T.</hi> ſaith, <hi>That to oblige Church-Members to wait for ordinary upon the miniſterial Adminiſtrations of their own Paſtor, is limiting the Holy One of Iſrael:</hi> What ſtrange Strides are theſe for a wiſe Man? Cannot Man be limited to wait upon God in a Way of Duty, according to God's Appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, but this muſt limit God? Doth God's limiting the Ocean, imply that he is thereby limited? Did God's bringing Man under a Law or Covenant, which limited Man in Point of Duty, any Way limit God in Point of Grace? If ſo, how ſhould there be any Room for God to enter into a ſecond Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant with fallen Sinners, in and thro' a Mediator? Was God limited by his limiting his publick Worſhip in a peculiar Manner at <hi>Jeruſalem;</hi> or by his limiting the Prieſthood to the Houſe of <hi>Aaron</hi> and the Tribe of <hi>Levi,</hi> even tho' all the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregation of <hi>Iſrael</hi> was holy? And yet did not <hi>Korah,</hi> tho' a <hi>Levite,</hi> ſuffer Vengeance for attempting to croſs and confound the Limits God put between the Houſe of <hi>Aaron</hi> and the <hi>Levites,</hi> and thoſe between the <hi>Levites</hi> and the reſt of the Tribes of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> And is not this written for our Inſtruction? Is God limited by his confining the publick Adminiſtration of his publick Church-Ordinances to publick Officers regularly called; or by his fixing a ſtated Relation between a particular Paſtor and a particular Flock, any more than he is limited as to the Continuation of Mankind, by fixing a particular Relation between an Huſband and Wife? But who among us limit God more in this Matter; than thoſe who ſuſpend the <hi>Succeſs of</hi> ſacred Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtrations upon the <hi>Gifts or Grace of the Miniſter or Inclination of the People,</hi> yea than thoſe that pronounce the <hi>ſame Word,</hi> preached by the Pariſh Miniſter unedifying, that is pronounced edifying when preached out of the Pariſh Lines, as if Diſorder itſelf would ſecure the Succeſs; or than thoſe who aſſert that Men muſt have ſuch and ſuch high Degrees of Law-Terrors, in order to Converſion and muſt be kept for a conſiderable Time under them, in order to bring them to the Birth, pronouncing all unconverted, who are not brought home in ſuch an obſervable Manner, as to be able to account for the Manner of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion by Feelings; as if God's Cords of Grace and Love had loſt their Strength and Force? Is it not very ſtrange, that Men who count the Fixing the Bounds of Man's Duty the Limiting of God, do unawares on the other Hand really ſtint and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcribe the Manner that God ſhall carry on Converſion Work?

How alien to the Purpoſe in Hand is Mr. <hi>T.</hi>'s quoting ſeveral Scriptures to prove God's Unſearchableneſs, in order as it would ſeem to prove, that People may or ought to forſake their own Miniſter for ordinary, and go to hear others, upon the Grounds aforeſaid? May not a Man with half an Eye ſee, that to draw ſuch an Inference from the Doctrine of God's Unſearchableneſs, is a palpable inconſequential Conſequence, which cannot be forced from it with any Colour of Reaſon? For doth not this prove, that <hi>he is a God nigh at Hand as well as a God afar off,</hi> or within as well as without the Pariſh Line? Tho' God be unſearchable and his Ways paſt finding out; yet hath not he declared his Statutes to <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and ſhewed Man what is good, ſo that he that reads may run in the Way of Duty? Tho' his Spirit <hi>like the Wind bloweth where it liſteth,</hi> as being a free Agent in all his gracious Operations; yet hath not he made it our Duty <hi>to watch daily at his Gates, and to wait at the Poſts of his Doors; and hath not he commanded the Bleſſing, even Life, upon the Mountains of Zion?</hi> Prov. 8.34. Pſ. 133.3. Tho' <hi>Jehovah rides upon the gloomy Cloud;</hi> yet hath not he made it our Duty to <hi>walk in the Way of his Commandments?</hi> Tho' <hi>he makes Darkneſs his Pavilion,</hi> doth not he require, that we ſhould <hi>walk in the Light?</hi> Tho' <hi>his Paths are in the great Waters,</hi> yet hath not he made it our Duty <hi>to keep upon a ſure Foundation,</hi> and not to venture into the deep Waters, leſt we ſink too ſoon? But what is this to the Matter in Hand? For when we know that God is unſearchable, is it Wiſdom for us to take the Wings of the Morning to try to ſearch him out, by climbing up to Heaven, or going into the Deep, or by riding upon the Clouds of Enthuſiaſm, or by dwelling in the Darkneſs of Ignorance, Errors and Diſorders, and be ſure to dwell the appointed Time in the deep Waters of Diſcomfort and Deſpair, according to the new forged Canon, till ſome petty Pope ſigns an Abſolution; and in order to find ſuch unhappy Paths, deſert our own Paſtors, who are not like to lead poor Souls into them, becauſe they fear God, love his Word, pity Souls, conſidering themſelves? Is not this a rare Piece of myſtical Divinity? It is a great Truth, that God is every where, and worketh where, when and as he liſteth; yet is this any Rule for Men to go over the Pariſh Line, rather than into the Pariſh-Kirk, when God's eſſential Preſence is in both alike, without the leaſt Difference? For may not he that tarries at home, and goes to neither of the two,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:004792_0073_100DEFFD50663630"/>
make as good a Plea for himſelf as either of the two, that he limits not God; for may not he ſay, that God may as well meet him upon his Bed or his Fire-ſide as in the Church or Field? For who can ſay, but that God may as well wo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>k without and contrary to Means as with them? For how elſe was the Spirit of Propheſy poured down on Mr. <hi>Wd.</hi> when reading a Play-Book? Is not this a fine Droll to wound Religion under the fifth Rib, when we pretend to ſtand up for it? For by Parity of Reaſon, may not Men without any great Stretch further, tell us, that we ſhould not confine ourſelves to read our Bibles or other Scriptural Books, in order to our Chriſtian Improvement, left we limit God? Shall we once more ſee the Time, when it will be told that a Play-Book, Pack of Cards, and the Book of Sports, muſt have their Turns, that Satan may be let looſe under the Pretence of Goſpel Liberty? For may not the Pretence of not limiting of God, with little more Courage, ſerve to cloak all as well as ſome Diſorders? But yet, is not God's Word a ſurer Rule by far, which teacheth that every particular Congregation are to have their particular Paſtor? When therefore God hath by his Providence brought us to a particular Relation to a Godly Miniſter, Have not we better Grounds in the Word of Truth, to expect God's Bleſſing upon the Labours of an orderly Miniſter, whom we in Obedience to Chriſt, have ſolemnly choſen according to Divine Inſtitution, to take the Over-ſight of us in the Lord, than upon the Adminiſtrations of a diſorderly Intruder? Is it not evident, that neither Miniſter nor People can fulfil the Duties of that Relation to each other, without walking in Fellowſhip with each other in attending upon Goſpel-Ordinances according to God's Word, <hi>without forſaking their own Aſſemblies?</hi> With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſuch an Attendance, what is the Paſtoral Relation but an empty Sound and meer Mockery? If then the Ties or Bonds of this Relation, which is God's Inſtitution, obliges the Flock to attend upon the paſtoral Adminiſtrations of their own Paſtor, as well as their own ſolemn Vows made at their contracting ſuch a Relation; can any in Faith expect, that the <hi>King who is held in the Galleries,</hi> will be more likely to meet them, by their ſtarting out of their aſſigned Poſt and Place, than by keeping in it? Will any tell us, what is that Cauſe which the Scripture aſſigns as ſufficient to juſtify the ordinary Forſaking, or Non-Attendance of a ſtated Member of a Congregation upon the regular ſacred Adminiſtrations of an orderly Paſtor, while the
<pb n="146" facs="unknown:004792_0074_100DEFFF155F38D0"/>
ſaid Relation ſubſiſts, and no providential Let ſtands in the Way? For is it not a great Truth, that no act of Religion, how glaring and ſpecious ſoever, hath a real Tendency to advance the Glory of God, or to promote the real Good of Souls, than when due Regard is had in the Performance of it to the Rule of God's Word, both as to the Matter and Manner? And can we think, that thoſe Acts, which tho' for the Matter may be good or middling, yet as to their Manner are downright irregular, and diſhonourable to God and Religion, ſhall be bleſſed for our greater Good, than thoſe which both for the Matter and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner are ſcriptural? Or may not we rather expect, that if we lead our ſelves into Temptation, by going to ramble out of the Way of Duty, by deſerting our proper Guides and Station, that this may provoke God to deſert us, to remove our Candleſticks, and encourage Satan to tempt us with ſuch deluſive Notions as may make Truth and Duty hateful to us, becauſe contrary to our wandring Inclinations, and vain Admiration of Perſons, and Love to vain Janglings?</p>
            <p>When therefore Mr. <hi>T.</hi> hath cleared the former Objections, and our Reaſoning thereupon, we deſire him to anſwer us, Whether the Practice of deſerting the ſacred Adminiſtrations of Men's ſtated godly and orthodox Paſtors, upon meer Conceits, Surmiſings and groundleſs Jealouſies, about their ſecret States, or other ſecret Reaſons, which admit of no ſolid Proof, be not</p>
