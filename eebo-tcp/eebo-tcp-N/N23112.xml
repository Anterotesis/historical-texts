            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <q>BUT NONE OF THESE THINGS MOVE ME, NEITHER COUNT I MY LIFE DEAR UNTO MYSELF, SO THAT I MIGHT FINISH MY COURSE WITH JOY, AND THE MINISTRY WHICH I HAVE RECEIVED OF THE LORD JESUS.</q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE are the words of the great apoſtle Paul. He addreſſed them to the elders of the church of Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus. Theſe elders endeavoured to diſſuade him from going to Jeruſalem, as they imagined he would there be expoſed to great troubles and dangers, from the enemies of the goſpel. The apoſtle conſidered it his duty to go. He was very deſirous of preaching chriſtianity to his countrymen, the Jews, who dwelt at Jeruſalem. He was determined not to be prevented, by the formidable pic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of impending dangers, ſet before him. He expect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed troubles, and was prepared to meet and bear them, with fortitude, and patience. "None of theſe things move me."</p>
            <p>HE expreſſes a firm and unſhaken reſolution, to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſue the path of duty, diſcovered to him, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the difficulties and hazards which might attend it. He had engaged in a good cauſe, in a good work, and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:030548_0004_0FE7A77E96BF798F8"/>
he would not deſert it, becauſe the duties of it could not be performed, but with great danger and ſelf-denial. In this he ſet a noble example, to the followers of CHRIST, in general, and to his miniſters in particular. "Hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing put their hand to the plough they ſhould not look back." They ſhould not neglect any known duty, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be the expence or pain of performing it.</p>
            <p>IN the following words of our text he riſes, in the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of a holy zeal and heroick courage. "Neither count I my life dear to me, that I might finiſh my courſe with joy, and the miniſtry which I have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived of the LORD JESUS." He had "received the miniſtry" of the goſpel, or an apoſtleſhip, "of the LORD JESUS," who is the great LORD of the harveſt, whoſe ſovereign province it is to ſend labourers into his vineyard. This apoſtle had a clear, a ſpecial, an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary call to this work. The call he had accepted; and to the ſervice he had devoted his life. Therefore to <hi>wear it out,</hi> or even to <hi>lay it down,</hi> in that ſacred em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, was not ſo painful to his mind and appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion, as the thought of quitting the work or doing the duties of it ſlightly. He had ſet out in the chriſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian <hi>courſe;</hi> he had engaged in the chriſtian <hi>miniſtry.</hi> To finiſh theſe well was his great object. This ſo ſtrongly engaged his attention and purſuit, as to give him a noble elevation of ſoul, above the obſtructions and diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments which might lie in the way. He expected his life would be ſpent, and perhaps ſhortned by a diligent and faithful performance of his duty as a chriſtian, and eſpecially as a chriſtian miniſter. He laid his account in this, and the event proved his calculation juſt.</p>
            <p>PAUL went to Jeruſalem. After he had preached the goſpel there, for a ſeaſon, and with ſome ſucceſs, the Jews, in a tumultuous manner ſeized him, and brought him before their eccleſiaſtical court. They accuſed him of ſubverting their ſyſtem of religion, and of teaching things contrary to the law of Moſes. He made a clear, rational, and animated defence. But finding it did not

ſatisfy the partial bigotted judges, before whom he was brought, he appealed to Caeſar, the roman emperor. After a while, he was ſent to Rome, to take his trial there. His trial was long delayed. During the delay, he enjoyed ſome liberty. He improved it, in promot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a cauſe, which lay near to his heart, and was dearer to him than his life. He preached the goſpel, planted chriſtian churches, and wrote epiſtles. After a while he was confined a priſoner at Rome. In priſon he wrote ſeveral of thoſe invaluable epiſtles, which we have in the new-teſtament, and which conſtitute part of the ſacred canon. After he was liberated from this con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finement, which continued about two years, he travelled over great part of Italy, preaching the goſpel, and found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing churches. He went to Spain, to Crete, to Philippi, to Macedonia; and at length, returned to Rome, about the year of the chriſtian aera 65. The ſacred hiſtory doth not particularly inform us, what brought on his ſecond impriſonment, at Rome, and his death. But ſome of the antient fathers, and particularly St. Chryſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtom, tell us, in their writings, that he having converted, by his miniſtry, a cupbearer, and a concubine, of the emperor Nero, who was a bitter enemy, and cruel per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutor, of chriſtianity, he was ſo enraged, that he order<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Paul to be ſeized, and committed to priſon: That from priſon he was brought forth, and beheaded, at a place called the <hi>ſalvian waters,</hi> on the 29th day of June, A. D. 66: That he was buried at <hi>Oſtium;</hi> and that af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, when the roman empire became chriſtian, a magnificent church was built over his tomb, which, Mr. Calmet, in his dictionary, ſays continue to this day. Thus this great apoſtle to the Gentiles, "finiſhed his courſe, and the miniſtry which he had received of the LORD JESUS," by the honors of martyrdom. No man, it is likely, ever did as much in ſpreading the goſpel, and promoting the cauſe of CHRIST, as he. That his ſufferings, in his cauſe were exceedingly great and preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing, we may collect, from the hiſtory of the acts of the apoſtles, and from ſeveral of his own letters, before he ſealed his teſtimony to the truth and goodneſs of that cauſe, by his blood.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:030548_0006_0FE7C558F160F80"/>
BUT is this a juſt picture of what the miniſters of CHRIST'S religion are to expect, and of what they do in general ſuffer? In anſwer to this enquiry, it may be ſaid, that there hath been no ſmall ſimilarity between the ſervices and ſufferings of this eminent ſervant of CHRIST, and thoſe of many, who were his brethren and companions, "in the kingdom and patience of JESUS;" eſpecially in the early days of chriſtianity, when its pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moters generally met with warm oppoſition, and cruel perſecution. The caſe has been very different, at ſome periods, and in ſome countries ſince. This difference hath been ſtrikingly obvious, in our happy land, in which the principles of religious liberty have been ſo well un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood; and maintained; and in which, the faithful miniſters of the goſpel, inſtead of being perſecuted, have been honoured, and encouraged, by men of the beſt and moſt reſpectable characters in civil ſtations.</p>
            <p>BUT can we hence pronounce, that labourers, in this part of CHRIST'S vineyard, have no trials and difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, connected with their profeſſion and employment? This would, undoubtedly, be carrying the matter too far, and ſaying what is univerſally found by experience not to be true.</p>
            <p>INDEED for one, in that profeſſion, to exhibit a long and dark catalogue of the trials and troubles which at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend it, might lead ſome to ſuſpect, that he aimed to make a merit to himſelf, in the fortitude and patience with which he meets, and bears ſuch trials and troubles. I wiſh not to fall under ſuch an imputation, or ſuſpicion. Still I do not conceive it amiſs for one, in the profeſſion, before mentioned, to ſuggeſt ſome of the burthens and difficulties which can hardly be ſeparated from it. This may tend to excite a proper degree of candor and ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs, in his fellow chriſtians towards him, and to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage their prayers for him. "He who wears the ſhoe, beſt knows where it is ſtrait and pinches," to uſe a common remark; or to uſe one of Solomon's, "the heart knoweth his own bitterneſs."</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="9" facs="unknown:030548_0007_0FE7C58F6F0D22B0"/>
No ſmall part of the difficulty of a goſpel miniſter's work and office, conſiſts in properly "taking heed to himſelf." To maintain that ſpirituality, that devout and pious frame of mind, and that ſober circumſpect courſe of conduct, which the chriſtian character requires, and which is peculiarly requiſite, to ſupport and adorn the miniſterial, is no eaſy thing, even for a good man. Great watchfulneſs, ſervent prayer, and help from above, are neceſſary to it. The miniſters of religion are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to "a city ſet on a hill which cannot be hid." Many eyes are upon them. Theſe are not always the eyes of candor and friendſhip, but too often of ſuſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cion and malevolence. What miniſter can be always ſo circumſpect and cautious, as to avoid creating, though without intending it, a number of little piques and ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, againſt himſelf? He may do it ſometimes, even by an inflexible diſcharge of neceſſary duties. And if his character muſt be taken from thoſe whom he has thus innocently, perhaps laudably, offended, all his vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues will be thrown into the back ground, and his foibles magnified with the utmoſt virulence of malice, and reſentment.</p>
            <p>No part of his profeſſional buſineſs, which a chriſtian miniſter has to perform, is without it's attendant trials and difficulties. He muſt, through a great proportion of his time, apply himſelf to cloſe ſtudy. "This is eaſy employment," ſome may be ready to pronounce; and thoſe would be moſt likely to pronounce ſuch an opinion, with confidence, who know leaſt of the matter. An ancient Sage, who knew what it is to apply his mind to a great variety of ſubjects, to acquire ſcience, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſtigate truth, remarks, "that much ſtudy is a weari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to the fleſh." Cloſe exertion of the mind preys rapidly on the body. It relaxes and weakens the various ſprings of the animal machine. It impairs the powers of digeſtion; hence crudities abound, producing that very afflictive and variegated tribe of diſorders, called <hi>nervous,</hi> and <hi>hypochondriac,</hi> by which no claſs of men ſuffer ſo much, as the ſedentary and ſtudious. They
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:030548_0008_0FE7C55ACDE23EB8"/>
often become ſtrangers to quiet repoſe, and refreſhing ſleep. All the ſprings of life are weakened, and the period of it frequently accelerated. Great ſtudents ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom enjoy a healthful vigorous ſtate of body, for any conſiderable ſpace of time. Their lot is often an early old age, and premature death.</p>
            <p>WILL it not require the vigorous employment of all the powers of the chriſtian paſtor's mind, to ſearch out the various truths and duties, contained in the ſacred oracles? To ſhew their harmony and connection? In weekly compoſitions, to aſtort and arrange them, in plain and familiar language; and in a manner adapted to the different ages, characters and circumſtances of his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple? To endeavour, by a proper application of them, to awaken the thoughtleſs and ſecure; to lead the weary and heavy laden to reſt and ſafety in CHRIST; to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move from hypocrites their falſe hopes and confidences, that they may build on the ſure corner ſtone, laid in Zion; to comfort the meek and humble followers of Jeſus, when their ſpirits are depreſſed, with gloomy apprehenſions of their ſtate and character; and to guide all into that way of ſalvation, revealed in the goſpel? The perſon who ſuppoſes ſuch ſervices can be perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſuch ſtated inſtructions prepared, without much cloſe ſtudy, and great application of mind, judges quite erroneouſly. He muſt have paid very little attention to the matter.</p>
            <p>As to the labor of <hi>public ſpeaking,</hi> from ſabbath to ſabbath, and on other days of ſocial worſhip, ſome may ſuppoſe it light and inconſiderable. Do ſuch judge rightly? Do they judge by experience? The experiment will ſhew ſuch an opinion to be unfounded, and muſt have taught all who have made it, that to ſtand for ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral hours, and to ſpeak, with a voice loud and forcible enough to be heard, by a large aſſembly, require no ſmall exertions of ſtrength; and that few things will ſooner ſpend and exhauſt it. Not only the lungs, and other organs of ſpeech, are kept on the ſtrain; but the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:030548_0009_0FE7C5954A6116D8"/>
powers of the mind muſt, at the ſame time, be vigor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly exerciſed. There muſt be a conſtant concern to ſpeak clearly and properly. In moſt aſſemblies the preacher has the additional trial, of ſeeing ſome before him, whoſe attention he is not able to gain, by his beſt endeavours, to prepare uſeful inſtructions, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver them with propriety; ſome who, either fall aſleep, or appear quite heedleſs and inattentive, "hearing as though they heard not;" others who, if they hear, it is not with the beſt diſpoſition; it is rather with a view, to watch for faults, and to make uncandid remarks, than to be inſtructed, and excited to a faithful perform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance of duty. A mere miſtake, in the ſpeaker, will, by ſuch perſons, be magnified into a crime; and any little impropriety, or uncouthneſs, in his accents, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciation, or geſture, will be more noticed, than the moſt uſeful and important ſentiments; will be remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bred longer, and be mentioned oftner, either to cenſure, or ridicule the performer. The preſent ſpeaker, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever liable he may be to ſuch remarks, has the ſatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to think, there are as few, among his ſtated hearers, diſpoſed to make them, as in moſt aſſemblies.</p>
            <p>BUT there is another thing, which may be ſtill more likely to excite unfriendly feelings, in many perſons towards their miniſter, and conſequently be an exerciſe to his faith and patience. His office obliges him to be plain and faithful in his public addreſſes, to reprove the vicious, to warn them of their danger, to call them to repentance, to urge on them the performance of neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lected duties, and to preſs ſuch a virtuous and godly converſation, as is contrary to a carnal heart, and a corrupt diſpoſition. Such exhortations and admoni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions will generally be ungrateful to the more looſe and vicious part of an audience. Will they not be apt to feel, towards their religious inſtructor, much as Ahab did towards the prophet Micajah, though they ſhould not expreſs their feelings, in ſo plain terms? "I hate him, for he always propheſieth evil concerning me."</p>

               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:030548_0010_0FE7C55C55834748"/>
STILL more difficult it may be, for a chriſtian mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter to give private counſel, exhortation and reproof, without awakening the reſentment of thoſe whom he addreſſes, and bringing on himſelf the pointed marks of their diſpleaſure. Yet faithfulneſs to GOD, and to them, will not ſuffer him to neglect this difficult and pain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful duty.</p>
            <p>THE ſervice, to which a miniſter is often called, of viſiting and converſing with the ſick, frequently involves in it great difficulties, trials, and temptations. He many times finds perſons, in ſore diſtreſs, both of body and mind. Their ſituation ſtrongly excites compaſſion. His heart muſt be hard and unfeeling indeed, not to be tenderly moved. As to many of theſe perſons, he may have no ground, from their former lives and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſation, to judge favourably of their ſpiritual ſtate. He wiſhes to ſpeak words of comfort to them, and to apply the promiſes of the goſpel, to diſpel their fears, and eaſe their pained minds. His bowels of pity and tenderneſs almoſt conſtrain him to do it. But he is anxious, left this ſhould produce a falſe peace, and lead them to reſt on deceptive hopes; left it ſhould prevent that ſenſe of guilt and danger, which they ought to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertain, in order to lay them low, humble, and penitent, at the feet of divine mercy, and to excite them to em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ploy their remaining moments, and their laſt breath, in ardent cries to a compaſſionate GOD and SAVIOUR, for pardoning mercy, and ſanctifying grace. What can the miniſter do? If he deals plainly and faithfully, through from the moſt benevolent motives, he may be deemed cruel: He may grieve and offend the ſick perſons, and their ſurrounding friends. Thoſe who have never been called to perform the part of a goſpel miniſter's duty, which we are conſidering, will hardly conceive the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficulties which in many caſes attend it. Great wiſdom is requiſite ſo to unite fidelity and tenderneſs; that a dangerous preſumption may not be encouraged, nor a fatal deſpondency produced, in the laſt and important days, and hours of ſickneſs, and of life.</p>

ANOTHER thing, in the ſituation of a miniſter of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, will, by perſons acquainted with human nature, be conſidered as painful and ſelfdenying, <abbr>viz.</abbr> his being obliged to give up his independence, ſo far as many of his people ſeem to expect; ſo far as to make himſelf ſubſervient to their call, their will, and, too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten, to their humour; ſo far as to have ſcarcely any time which he can call his own; ſo far as not to be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed to claim many of the common rights of human nature, with that free and independent ſpirit, with which other good men among his people do it, without giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing any offence. He ought undoubtedly to adopt the language, and ſentiment of the great apoſtle, who owned himſelf "his people's ſervant for JESUS' ſake;" and to be willing in a ſober and conſiſtent ſenſe, "to become all things to all men; " i. e. to diſcover a kind, yielding, and condeſcending diſpoſition. But is it certain that this would give univerſal ſatisfaction? There may be, in moſt ſocieties, a number who expect their miniſter ſhould make a greater ſacrifice than this to pleaſe them. He muſt forbear to declare his opinion, with that decent freedom which others uſe, upon religious, domeſtic, or political ſubjects, concerning which a diverſity of ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents prevails among his people. Many individuals may be ready to claim a right of prohibiting their mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter from expreſſing an opinion contrary to their's. If he doth not yield to that prohibition, he will hardly fail of meeting with the diſpleaſure of the perſons, from whom he dares to diſſent. Miniſters, as well now, as in the day of our SAVIOUR'S abode upon earth, need to be "wise as ſerpents, and harmleſs as doves." And when they ſincerely deſire and endeavour to be ſo, it is hardly to be expected they ſhould be ſo fortunate as to give offence to none. Their conceſſions may not come up to the wiſhes of ſome. Is it poſſible to pleaſe all, when ſo many, and ſo different tempers and diſpoſitions, views and deſigns exiſt among their pariſhioners?</p>

ONE of the moſt painful trails, which Chriſt's mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſters often meet with, ſtill remains to be mentioned, namely, the little attention paid to their moſt faithful inſtructions, by a great proportion of their people, and the ſmall ſucceſs of their labours, in general. It is hard to ſay what can be more grievous and diſheartening to thoſe who have a proper concern for the proſperity of the Redeemer's kingdom, and the ſalvation of precious ſouls. Under this diſcouragement, reſpecting the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to whom he miniſtred, the prophet Jeremiah once made this reſolution, "I will ſpeak no more to them, in the name of the LORD." This drew very moving com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints from ſome others of GOD'S antient prophets. "I have laboured in vain, and ſpent my ſtrength for nought: Iſrael will not be gathered. Who hath be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieved our report?"</p>

               </gap> a miniſter is diligent in his ſtudies, fervent in his prayers, earneſt in his preaching, faithful in giving private counſel, and circumſpect in his own conduct, yet then to obſerve many among his people growing evidently more hardened and fixed in wickedneſs; many who will not give themſelves the trouble of attend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing publick worſhip; many more, who appear quite careleſs and unconcerned about the welfare of their immortal ſouls; and ſome among thoſe who have bound themſelves, by publick covenant engagements, to main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a life of ſtrict piety and virtue, yet walking very unſuitably to the profeſſion they have made; what can more deeply and painfully wound him? Yet thus wound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, many times, are CHRIST'S faithful miniſters. Their time, their ſtrength, and their lives are wearing away, without the comfort of ſatisfactory evidences that "their labour is not in vain, in the LORD."</p>
            <p>I HAVE been long, perhaps too long, in ſketching out the dark ſide of the picture of a chriſtian miniſter's ſitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation. Still nothing has been ſaid but what I believe to be a juſt repreſentation, and what is often realized, by perſons in the ſacred office. This may have led many
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:030548_0013_0FE7C59C8BD7C0E8"/>
miniſters, of the preſent day, to apply to themſelves, the remark which the apoſtle made, relative to himſelf, and his brethren in the apoſtolic office. "If in this life only we have hope, we are of all men moſt miſerable."</p>
            <p>BUT is there no bright ſide to this picture? Is there no counterpart to what hath been deſcribed, of a mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſter's labours, trials and conflicts? Hath he no pleaſures and comforts, while diſcharging the duties of his ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion? He undoubtedly has, if he is faithful, and ſome which are exceedingly endearing and ſupporting. The approbation of his own conſcience, and comfortable hopes of the Divine approbation. Senſible aid and aſſiſtance in his labours, from the ſpirit and grace of CHRIST. Delightful contemplations on the truths, and bleſſings of the goſpel, for which his profeſſional buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs gives him great advantages. The friendſhip, the warm affection, the ſincere good wiſhes, and the fervent prayers, of the moſt amiable and worthy characters, among his people. Great ſatisfaction, ſometimes, in ſeeing "the pleaſure of the LORD proſpering in his hands;" and "ſouls ſlocking to CHRIST, as doves to their windows:" And eſpecially the proſpect of thoſe gracious rewards, which CHRIST hath promiſed to his faithful miniſters, when they ſhall have finiſhed their courſe, and the miniſtry they have received. "Be ye faithful unto death, and I will give you a crown of life."</p>
            <p>WILL not the faithful labourer, in the vineyard of CHRIST, who keeps the eye of his faith fixed on ſuch gracious promiſes, be comforted, in all his tribulations? Will he not, like the apoſtle, though ſorrowful, yet be always rejoicing? Yea it may be hoped that in the near views of death, he may be able in a good meaſure hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly to adopt his joyful and triumphant language. <q>I am now ready to be offered, and the time of my de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parture is at hand.

WHO could be expected to enter into the ſacred em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment, or long to continue in it, if nothing of this ſort was to be expected, or found, to ballance the many trials and difficulties which are inſeparable from it? More virtue and fortitude, than moſt men are poſſeſſed of, would be requiſite to prevent their ſhrinking from a ſervice, ſo unpromiſing, yea ſo formidable. But our SAVIOUR doth not leave, thus comfortleſs, his servants, whom He calls into his vineyard. Though the rewards of their diligence and fidelity are principally reſerved to the future world, yet for their preſent ſupport and comfort, He hath made ſuch gracious declarations as the following "Lo I am with you always to the end of the world. My grace is ſufficient for you, and my ſtrength is made perfect in your weakneſs."</p>
            <p>WITH an expectation of both theſe, the trials<note n="*" place="bottom">Seven members of the church, and three or four others, oppoſed his ſettlement.

SOON after his entering on the work he was viſited with ſuch bodily infirmities, as led him to expect his life and labours would be ſhort; that he ſhould, in a little time, finiſh his courſe, and the miniſtry which he had received. Still, with truth he can ſay, he did not forget his vows and reſolutions, to work while it was day; nor did he feel an unwillingneſs to ſpend what little ſtrength he had, in the ſervice of his beloved people. He did "not account his life dear to him," if he might ſpend it ſucceſsfully in the great work, on which he had entered. To the honour of GOD, he deſires thankfully to mention it, that he was ſtrengthened to go on, in his profeſſional labours, much beyond his expectations, and with no long interruptions, for a number of years. With ſentiments of gratitude and affection, he often re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flects on the kind, candid, and tender manner, in which his people treated him, and with which his feeble endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to ſerve them were received. They did not deſpiſe either his youth or his infirmities. The abundant marks of their ſympathetick tenderneſs and affection rendered all his labours among them, eminently labours of love, which were their own reward.</p>
            <p>AFTER about eighteen years, feebly, yet pleaſantly ſpent, in their ſervice, GOD was pleaſed to viſit him with a threatning fever, which reduced him, in appearence, to the very gates of the grave. The tenderneſs with which they miniſtred to him during that ſickneſs, is freſh in his grateful remembrance. Their prayers,<note n="*" place="bottom">A day of faſting and prayer was obſerved by his people, on his account.</note> which GOD was pleaſed graciouſly to anſwer, called him back to further labours among them. The bleſſing of Heaven, on the gratuitous, the careful, and judicious preſcriptions, and attendance of his ſkilful and bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volent phyſician,<note n="†" place="bottom">Doctor John Sprague.</note> recovered him to a better ſtate of health, than he had enjoyed for ſome time before. With renewed pleaſure and reſolution he again entered on his publick and private labours, in the goſpel. And with renewed marks of reſpect his people received him.</p>

DURING about ſeventeen years after this, he was not abſent from public worſhip more than two ſabbaths, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cepting the time when he had the ſmall pox, which de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained him three. Frequently, however, in that term of ſeventeen years, has he come into this houſe of worſhip, weak and trembling, when it appeared to him hardly poſſible that, without ſpecial help from above, he ſhould go through the ſervices of the day. Strength was, as he deſires thankfully to record, from time to time, vouch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſafed to him.</p>
            <p>ABOUT five years ago, he was viſited with a ſlow fever, which detained him from the houſe of GOD, for five ſab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>baths. Since that time, he hath, every Lord's day at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended the ſervices of the ſanctuary. He deſired now to ſet up his EBENEZER, acknowledging that "hitherto the LORD hath helped him." He hath ſpared, and aſſiſted him, to labour in his vineyard, feeble and imperfect as his labours have been, much longer than any of his pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, in this ſociety. His term of ſervice hath been protracted beyond that of moſt of his brethren, in the miniſtry.</p>
            <p>UPON retroſpecting this term of forty years, your miniſter finds much to lament, much to be humbled for, of his faults, defects, and imperfections. His hope is in the abundant mercy of GOD, and the merit of that blood, which was ſhed for the prieſthood as well as for the congregation; to pardon what has been amiſs; and to accept his feeble, though, he hopes, ſincere attempts to promote the cauſe of Chriſt, and the good of ſouls. He finds, at the ſame time, many things which demand his gratitude to his DIVINE MASTER; particularly, that he hath called him to labour in ſo pleaſant a part of his vineyard; that he hath ſupported and aſſiſted him ſo long; that he hath rendered his ſervices, in a good degree ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptable to his people; and that they have not, as he would humbly hope, been wholly uſeleſs and unſucceſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful; though it is a painful conſideration, that the evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences of their ſucceſs have been ſo few. It is matter
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:030548_0017_0FE7C5A3F5677E58"/>
of pleaſing and grateful reflection, that friendſhip and harmony among the people of his charge, and between him and them, have ſo generally prevailed. He fer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vently prays, that "brotherly love may continue." He rejoices with his flock that they have been, and now are, ſo free from thoſe religious diſputes, and contentions, which prevail in ſome ſocieties; occaſioned by different and militating ſentiments, and by the prevalence of va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious ſects and denominations of chriſtians.<note n="*" place="bottom">

THE number of deaths in this ſociety, within the term of 40 years paſt, according to the moſt authentick re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cords, is 529. I have formerly mentioned, that the yearly average number of deaths was between 9 and 10. It was ſo during the firſt 19 years of my miniſtry. In the laſt 21 years, in which the ſmall pox hath ſeveral times, prevailed among us; the dyſentry, and ſome other epidemick diſtempers, the average number has been conſiderably greater.</p>
            <p>OF the 529 perſons who have died, 9 have arrived to the age of 90 years, or upwards, which is nearly in the proportion of 1 to 60. 42 have lived to be 80 years old and upwards, beſides the 9 who ſurvived 90 years. This ſhews about 1 in 12 to arrive to the age of 80 years.</p>
            <p>74 perſons have died between 70 and 80 years of age, which, in connection with the calculations above, ſhews that as great a proportion as 1 in 5, of thoſe who have died, in the term aforeſaid, have lived to ſee threeſcore years and ten, or more. I cannot aſcertain the number of births in this ſociety, during the term of 40 years paſt. It may be about 1100.</p>
            <p>THE above calculations ſhew, that a greater propor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of perſons, among us, than has been generally ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, has lived to what we may call old age. If a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gular, ſober, and virtuous mode of living may be aſſign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as the natural cauſe, it reflects honour on the ſociety.

            <p>THE number of females, who have lived to old age, is a little larger than that of males. There is not one man, now in the ſociety, quite 80 years old. There is one woman, in her 94th year; and ſeveral between 80 and 90 years old.

Not a few of them were his intimate and confidential friends, whom he often met, with great delight, in the houſe of GOD, and at the table of CHRIST, mingling hearts and affections, in the exerciſes of piety and devotion.

            <p>IF the names of thoſe who have died, from among us, within the term often mentioned above, ſhould be called over, moſt of us ſhould hear ſome which deſignated our neareſt and deareſt connexions.

He was diſmiſſed from his office, October 9th 1769. <abbr>Rev.</abbr> Thomas Prentiſs was inducted into the paſtoral office in that town, October 31ſt 1770; and continues to miniſter to that people in holy things. A ſmall baptiſt ſociety has, for a number of years, exiſted in that town. The late <abbr>rev.</abbr> Thomas Gair, was for ſeveral years the paſtor. Since his removal, a Mr. Clarke resides there, and frequently preaches to them.</p>
                  <p>IN Wrentham, <abbr>rev.</abbr> Joſeph Bean was miniſter. On the 12th of December 1784, his life, and his very faithful labours were ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minated, in the 66th year of his age, and 34th of his miniſtry. <abbr>Rev.</abbr> David Avery was inſtalled his ſucceſſor, May 25, 1786, and his diſmiſſion voted by the town, agreeably to advice of council, April 21, 1794. It is painful to add, that that church and town, which for more than a century enjoyed great peace, harmony, and proſperity, are now in a very unhappy, divided, broken ſtate. May they be led to know and purſue the things which are promotive of peace, and chriſtian edification! A ſmall baptiſt ſociety is in the weſterly part of that town. A <abbr>rev.</abbr> Mr. Williams is their miniſter.</p>
                  <p>THE 2d pariſh in Wrentham continued vacant, after the death of <abbr>rev.</abbr> Elias Haven, till June 4th 1760, when the <abbr>rev.</abbr> Caleb Bar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num was ordained their paſtor. He obtained a diſmiſſion from the paſtoral office after about 9 years ſervice among them, and was, ſoon after, inſtalled paſtor of the church in Taunton. He went chaplain into the weſtern army, in 1776, and died abroad. The <abbr>rev.</abbr> Nathaniel Emmons was ordained his ſucceſſor, in Wrentham, April 21. 1773, and continues the beloved paſtor of that flock. This 2d pariſh in Wrentham was, in the year 1778, made a town, by an act of incorporation, and the name <hi>Franklin</hi> given to it.</p>
                  <p>IN Needham, the <abbr>rev.</abbr> Mr. Townſend continued his faithful labours till September 30th 1762, when his Lord called him away by death, in the 65th year of his age, and 43d of his miniſtry. <abbr>Rev.</abbr> Samuel Weſt was ordained his ſucceſſor, April 25th, 1764. He left Needham in November 1788; and was ſoon inſtalled paſtor of a church in Boſton, where he now officiates. The <abbr>rev.</abbr> Stephen Palmer was ordained to the paſtoral office, in Needham, November 7. 1792, and there continues his miniſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. A number of the inhabitants of Needham got incorpor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ated into a diſtinct precinct, about the year 1773. They were led to ſeek this, on account of ſome diſagreement in the town, reſpecting the place of building a meeting houſe. This 2d pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cinct has not yet ſettled a miniſter.</p>
                  <p>IN Walpole, their firſt miniſter, <abbr>rev.</abbr> Phillips Payſon, died Janu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ary 22d 1778, in the 74th year of his age, and 50th of his mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtry. The <abbr>rev.</abbr> George Morey, his ſucceſſor, was ordained Nov. 19th 1783, and continues the guide and overſeer of that people.</p>
                  <p>IN the ſecond pariſh in Dedham, the <abbr>rev.</abbr> Thomas Balch conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nued his acceptable labours till January 8th 1774, when he was removed by death, in the 63d year of his age, and 38th of his miniſtry, and was ſucceeded in office, by <abbr>rev.</abbr> Jabez Chickering, the preſent paſtor, who was ordained July 3d 1776.</p>
                  <p>IN the 3d pariſh in Dedham, of which the <abbr>rev.</abbr> Andrew Tyler was paſtor, ſome unhappy diſſentions took place, about the year 1764. Attempts to reſtore peace and harmony not ſucceeding, Mr. Tyler was diſmiſſed from office, about the cloſe of the year 1772. He died in Boſton in 1775. The <abbr>rev.</abbr> Thomas Thacher was ordained his ſucceſſor, June 7th 1780.</p>
                  <p>THE 4th pariſh in Dedham had the <abbr>rev.</abbr> Benjamin Caryl ſet over them in the Lord, as their firſt paſtor, Nov. 10th 1762. He ſtill labours among them in word and doctrine. That pariſh was incorporated, as a <hi>district,</hi> by the general court, July 7th 1784, and had the name <hi>Dover</hi> given to it.</p>

And if we ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend our view to a larger circle, to mark the footſteps of divine providence, in the vicissitudes which have taken place, within no very long period of paſt time, more uſeful information will ariſe to our minds. With<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the eaſy recollection of many of us, the grand Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican revolution hath been brought about, which has given our country a ſtation among the ſovereign and independent nations of the earth. This forms an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant aera, and hath given, or confirmed to us, civil and religious privileges, equal, perhaps ſuperior, to thoſe enjoyed in any part of the world; eſpecially taken in connexion with thoſe wiſe conſtitutions of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which have been formed, in our country, and carried into operation, during, and ſince the revolution. The faithful page of hiſtory, it is hoped, will convey the knowledge of theſe great events to the lateſt generations.</p>

The ſecond, which many of you remember, ſtood 90 years. In the year 1762 it was taken down, and this, in which we now aſſemble, was erected, in the ſame place. The ſpot fixed upon, by the proprietors, for the firſt, ſeems, by general conſent, to have been deemed the moſt ſuitable, ever ſince.

It is well underſtood that the fund, which the church now poſſeſſes, proceeded from the ſale of a number of lots of land, which belonged to it. This ſale was made more than 30 years ago. The money produced by it was let out upon intereſt. The intereſt, for a ſucceſſion of years, was added to the principal. The annual intereſt now amounts to about 267 dollars, or 80 pounds.

            <p>AND to it's honour, it may be mentioned, that a ſpirit of candor and accommodation hath generally marked it's proceedings, to the maintaining peace and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny. This was the caſe in building this houſe for

public worſhip; and in ſettling the feats, apartments and conveniences to be enjoyed in it. This was the caſe when a change of the verſion of the pſalms,<note n="*" place="bottom">ABOUT 35 years ago the ſociety, with very little oppoſition, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changed, what was generally called, the <hi>New-England</hi> pſalms, for the verſion of Tate and Brady, and a collection of Dr. Watts's hymns bound with it. About three years ago, without any oppoſition, they introduced Dr. Watts's verſion of the pſalms, and his hymns, in the room of Tate and Brady's.</note> to be uſed in public worſhip, was repeatedly made. And this hath been the caſe in regulating that agreeable part of religious ſervice, ſinging the praiſes of GOD in his houſe.<note n="†" place="bottom">Much commendation and thanks are due to thoſe who lead in that part of worſhip, for the judicious and pleaſing manner in which the ſervice is performed.</note> And, this alſo hath been the caſe when altera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions were, more than once, propoſed, and agreed to, as to terms and modes,<note n="‡" place="bottom">
                  <p>March 7th 1742, the church voted not to inſiſt on perſons offering relations, as a term of admiſſion into fellowſhip with them; and at the ſame time introduced a confeſſion of faith, to be publickly aſſented to, by each perſon, when admitted, who did not offer a relation. This confeſſion of faith, though excellent in general, was long, and contained ſome religious tenets, concerning which many pious perſons have their doubts and difficulties. About the year 1767, it was ſuggeſted to the church, that ſomething more conciſe, and expreſſed in more general terms, might better anſwer the purpoſe. A ſubſtitute of that kind was propoſed, and peaceably adopted.</p>
                  <p>At a meeting of the church, April 11th 1793, it was ſuggeſted, whether it might not be adviſeable to make ſome alterations in the modes and forms of admitting perſons into communion. A committee was choſen to conſider the matter and report, what they think proper to be done. The committee, at an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journment of the meeting, reported a general form of chriſtian union, and covenant engagements, in which all perſons admitted are to agree. This was adopted without oppoſition. The ſaid committee alſo reported the following method of admit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting perſons, as, in their opinion, proper and adviſeable, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                     <q>That a perſon, deſiring admiſſion, ſhall apply to the minister, and make his deſire known; that the miniſter ſhall mention this, in public; and if no valid objection is offered againſt the perſon, within a fortnight, the name of the perſon ſhall be inſerted in the church covenant, before-mentioned. And when the miniſter hath notified the church, that this has been done, ſuch perſon ſhall be conſidered as a member of the church, and be treated as ſuch.</q> This report was accepted by the church, the following clauſe being added, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
                     <q>Provided however, that if any perſon ſhall chuſe rather to be admitted into the church, in either of the methods which have been heretofore uſed, they ſhall readily be allowed their choice.</q>
                  </p>
               </note> of admitting perſons to church fellowſhip, and chriſtian privileges. Few diſputes and controverſies have prevailed in the church or ſociety. If the members have not always been <q>perfectly joined to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether in the ſame mind, and in the ſame judgment,</q>
               <pb n="28" facs="unknown:030548_0026_0FE7C578B6866F60"/>
yet a diſpoſition has prevailed, to permit every one freely to enjoy the right of his private opinion, provided he doth not break in upon the rights of others. This ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of candor and mutual forbearance has happily tended to the peace of the community. GOD grant it may abound among us, more and more.</p>
            <p>BUT whether the ſcenes through which we paſs, or the events upon which we are remarking, be pleaſing or painful; one thing is certain; we ſhall be here but a little while, to obſerve them. The faſhion of the world changes, and paſſes away, and we are changing, and paſſing away with it.</p>
            <p>YOUR paſtor need not tell you that he is in the decline of life. Evidences of it cannot eſcape his and your obſervation. He deſires to adore that kind providence, which has ſuſtained him ſo long. And he takes this op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity to expreſs ſentiments of gratitude to his be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loved people, for the candor and friendſhip with which they have generally treated him. He wiſhes never to forget the many, many expreſſions of their kindneſs and affection. Unkindneſſes, and injuries he deſires to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>member none. He wiſhes to be inſtrumental of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting their beſt intereſt, during the ſhort remaining period, GOD may continue him in the miniſtry. He earneſtly requeſts their prayers that he may be ſo. He has no ground to calculate upon a long continuance. He can expect no other, than e'er long to be laid by, as a broken, or worn out veſſel. But while any conſider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:030548_0027_0FE7C5B3E51266F8"/>
degree of bodily ſtrength, and powers of mind, is continued to him, he hopes not to be a mere cumberer of the ground, or burden to ſociety. To ſurvive all capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of uſefulneſs, appears to him an event, by no means to be deſired.</p>
            <p>THOUGH he ſincerely wiſhes that his private inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe among his people may be agreeable to them, and miniſter to their profit; yet probably his occaſional viſits may not, in frequency, come up to their expecta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, or his own inclination. Should this be the caſe, their candor, and good ſenſe will furniſh ſufficient apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>logies. They will do him the juſtice, to acknowledge, that he hath not been a ſtranger, in their families, in times of ſickneſs and trouble. As he hath taken a tender and ſympathetick part, in their afflictions, it is his deſire to do ſo ſtill, to the extent of his ſtrength and abilities.</p>
            <p>HE feels great ſolicitude for the utility and ſucceſs of his publick <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

The ſmall capa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city he has, as a publick religious teacher, he deſires di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligently and faithfully to improve. Still it lies very much with his hearers to determine, whether theſe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours ſhall be beneficial to them or not. Without a ſtated, ſerious, and prayerful attention, on their part, what profit can they expect to receive? He earneſtly intreats them not refuſe ſuch an attention.</p>
            <p>THE remarks which have been made, at this time, he hopes will be received with the ſame candor and friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip, with which they have been prepared, and deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. For a publick ſpeaker to ſay ſo much concerning himſelf, may be deemed rather indelicate. The ſubject and the occaſion are his apology. He hath not been wont to treſpaſs in this way. And this probably may be the laſt time, that any thing of this ſort, will be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>livered by him, in this place. Poſſibly ſome of the hiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torical anecdotes, in the foregoing pages, may be thought too ſmall and trifling to have a place there. It was the deſire of the writer not to offend in this way. Little incidents generally intereſt the feelings of perſons im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately concerned in them.</p>

To conclude,</p>
            <p>THE paſtor of this flock conſiders his time, all his little ſtrength, whether of body or mind, and even his life, devoted to the honour of CHRIST, and the promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their ſpiritual good; and thinks he can ſincerely adopt the language of the apoſtle, and ſay, that he "doth not account his life dear to him," if it may be thus faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully, and uſefully ſpent; and "his courſe, and miniſtry finiſhed with joy."</p>
            <p>THE law of mortality, if nothing elſe, muſt e'er long, diſſolve the relation of paſtor and flock, which has now ſubſiſted between him and them, through the term of forty years. GOD grant that he and they may <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
