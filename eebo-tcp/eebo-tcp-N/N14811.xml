            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            </opener>
            <p>THERE has lately appeared <hi>A Dissertation on the politi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal Union, and Constitution of the Thirteen United States of North-America,</hi> written by a Citizen of <hi>Philadelphia,</hi> which (for political reasons I conclude,) has been reprinted in this state; which pamphlet contains maxims and senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments inconsistent with, and subversive of the <hi>sovereignty, freedom</hi> and <hi>independence</hi> of these states, calculated to subvert our happy constitution, and to introduce a system or form of government more <hi>sovereign, arbitrary</hi> and <hi>despotic.</hi> I have waited with impatience for some abler pen to detect and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose the secret designs of this author. None appearing, I now present you with the remarks I made, when I first read that Dissertation.</p>
            <p>But before I enter upon that subject I would just observe to you, that in founding this new and rising empire, we ought carefully to avoid those errors which have brought ruin on our Parent State.</p>
            <p>The national <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> of Great-Britain is become so immense<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly large, that it is not in her power any longer to enslave us, or to tyrannize over the nations of Europe; which has been accumulated by granting exorbitant salaries to the officers of the crown, and supporting a host of <hi>placemen</hi> and <hi>pension<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers,</hi> that since the last war, the interest of the national debt will not admit of any abatement of taxes; but on the other hand, new ones must be devised, or additions made to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer taxes for the support of government in peace, which
<pb n="iiii" facs="unknown:018782_0003_0FA8154945BAA8D8"/>
must distress the poor—drive out many of their manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turers and useful members of society—sink the value of their lands, if not bring on national bankruptcy; and such as cannot seek an asylum elsewhere, must sink down into the most abject state of vassalage and slavery—And the same causes will produce the same effects in every region under the sun.</p>
            <p>In the <hi>first place</hi> therefore, if we would avoid their <hi>fate,</hi> let us carefully avoid those measures which have brought on her <hi>ruin.</hi>—<hi>Rome</hi> no sooner became <hi>luxurious,</hi> but she lost her <hi>liberty,</hi> which was every thing worth preserving.—High salaries and emoluments of office do not always convey <hi>wisdom, prudence, and skill in the arts of government.</hi>—Luxu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in those who <hi>govern,</hi> will contaminate the body of the people, and fraud, injustice and oppression will be introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed among the common people, to supply the want of the revenues of office among the <hi>great.</hi>—In order therefore to prevent any further the accumulation of our debt, contract<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed during the war, it would be more to the honour of the states, to copy after the prudent oeconomy of the States of <hi>Holland</hi> while they were loaded with a heavy debt, than to <hi>mimic</hi> the pomp, or assume the parade and pegeantry of the courts of <hi>Europe.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the <hi>next place,</hi> if we would support our national credit <hi>abroad,</hi> and regain that confidence which ought forever to be put in public credit at <hi>home,</hi> let us be <hi>just</hi>—do strict jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice both to the officers and soldiers of our <hi>brave army,</hi> who have <hi>fought, bled</hi> and <hi>suffered,</hi> in the cause of their country; make speedy and ample provision for the payment of the <hi>interest,</hi> and sinking the principle both of our <hi>national</hi> and <hi>internal</hi> debt, as soon as they can be adjusted, and ascertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to <hi>satisfaction</hi>—which will secure us the favour and pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of heaven, and make us respectable both at home and abroad.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="v" facs="unknown:018782_0003_0FA8154945BAA8D8"/>
Our public debt although large, with proper oeconomy may be discharged in the compass of a few years, without distressing the states, provided the several legislatures adopt measures to draw out their wealth, without disgusting them to such a degree, as to refuse submission—which will be the greatest calamity that can befal us, which a careful exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the expenditure of public monies, and strictly calling to account all public defaulters, will have the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est tendency to prevent.—The consternation into which these states were thrown, by this <hi>bloody, cruel</hi> and <hi>unnatural</hi> war, will and ought to be a sufficient excuse for the expen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diture of large sums to little or no profit.—But all <hi>criminal</hi> defaulters, who have appropriated public monies to their own private advantages, or to the aggrandizement of their families, ought publicly to be stigmatized with <hi>indelible reproach.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>A late writer has justly observed, <hi>"That the art of sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porting government, and maintaining authority is a delicate art, and requires more circumspection than is generally thought neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary: They who</hi> GOVERN <hi>are perhaps too much accustomed to hold men in</hi> CONTEMPT, <hi>and regard them too much as slaves, subdued and bent down by</hi> NATURE, <hi>while they are only so by</hi> HABIT; <hi>if you lay on a</hi> NEW LOAD, <hi>take care they do not shake it off with</hi> FURY <hi>and with</hi> INTEREST, <hi>forget not that the</hi> LE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>VER OF POWER, <hi>has no other support than</hi> OPINION; <hi>that the power of those who</hi> GOVERN <hi>is in reality but the power of those who</hi> SUFFER GOVERNMENT. <hi>Remind not people sleeping in their chains, to lift up their eyes to truths too terrible for you; and while they are</hi> OBEYING, <hi>bring not to their remembrance their right to</hi> COMMAND, <hi>when the moment of their rousing shall arrive; when they shall have thought in earnest, that they are not made for their magistrates, but their magistrates for them; when they shall once be able to bring themselves to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether, to feel the communication of kindred minds; and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounce
<pb n="vi" facs="unknown:018782_0004_0FA81549E02297D0"/>
with a voice unanimous, we will not have this law; this practice is offensive, medium is no more; you must be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strained, by an unavoidable alternative, either to punish or to yield; either to be tyrannical, or weak, and your authority thence forward detested or despised.</hi>"—To which I would only add—Human nature, vi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>e as it is, (mankind are so far convinced of the necessity of civil government,) will submit to be go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned by just and equitable laws, but will be stubborn and fractious when they are unjust, unreasonable and op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressive—and in this consists the art of governing, more especially a <hi>commonwealth;</hi> and from this quarter republi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>can rulers may look out to prevent trouble in due season, before it is too late. It is an old saying, but a true one, all men cannot <hi>judge,</hi> but they can all <hi>feel.</hi> Nothing will produce a quicker sensation among a free people, who have been accostomed to <hi>eating, drinking,</hi> and being <hi>cloathed,</hi> than to be abridged of those necessary articles, for the private e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>molument of a few individuals.</p>
            <p>It must be acknowledged the highest wisdom in these states, to encourage and promote <hi>frugality, industry, agricul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture,</hi> and our own <hi>manufactures;</hi> and to suppress by every judicious measure, <hi>luxury</hi> and <hi>dissipation</hi> of every kind. To accomplish these important views, I must for my own part highly approve of an <hi>impost</hi> recommended by our honoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Continental Congress, in which each state ought to be uniform as to the impost imposed. But whether such an impost laid by Congress, and collected by officers by them appointed; or to be collected by officers appointed by the authority of the state, accountable to our own legislature, to be appropriated to the discharging our quota of the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional debt, as soon as the same shall be ascertained, or to be paid into the Continental treasury, to be applied to such uses as they think proper, I must submit to the good sense and integrity of the legislature of the state, on which I think I can safely rely.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="vii" facs="unknown:018782_0004_0FA81549E02297D0"/>
The <hi>necessaries</hi> of life are few and simple—The conveni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>encies of life many—The luxuries of life still more, and they are such as corrupt, the morals of the people.—Encourage industry, and by a sort of necessary consequence, you make mankind frugal and virtuous.—To discharge our quota of the national debt by an impost on all goods or produce of foreign growth imported, every man may choose how much of the national debt he will pay, which will be in exact pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion, to the foreign articles of commerce which he pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chases for his own consumption: If my circumstances will permit, and my pride and vanity prompts me to wear a cloth of 40s. per yard, I pay in that article four times as much as my neighbour, who contents himself with a cloth of 10s. which will answer all the purposes of life as well, and in some cases much better, than what cost four times that sum.—But at the same time, if the citizens of these states are unwilling to pay our quota of debt, or to support go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, by taxing the luxuries of life, which will gradu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally and insensibly induce us to be frugal and industrious, it will be to little purpose to enact laws for that end.—To enact laws one session of the assembly, to be repealed the next, only enervates government, and renders the legisla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture contemptible.—I should therefore think it best, besure in <hi>democratical</hi> governments, before any new mode of taxa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is adopted by the legislature—to print the bill design<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to be passed into a law, with the reasons on which it is founded, and to let the people at large have an opportunity to weigh the reasons of it, before any undue prejudices arise in their minds, or are excited by designing men, and they generally will make a good judgment. But to frame a law, which will give a general uneasiness and dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gust, it will be impracticable to execute it.—Perhaps this may be thought too much beneath the dignity of the legis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lature of the state; but if my memory doth not betray me,
<pb n="viii" facs="unknown:018782_0005_0FA8154C46A97D78"/>
it has been, on some occasions, practised by the British par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, and if it had always been practised both by them, and the several assemblies of these states, it would often have saved them the trouble of frequent repeals. Paying of mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, with the greater part of the citizens of this state, is a very serious matter, and those who are best able, are easier led than drove.—It is firmly rivited on my mind, the body of the freemen and citizens of this state are <hi>honest,</hi> and truly wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to pay their quota of the public debt, <hi>justly</hi> due, and shall continue of that opinion, until I see just grounds to al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter my <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>entiments; and for my own part, I am desirous that they should choose the mode in which it shall be done.—If the landed interest of this state, choose their landed in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest, stock, &amp;c. should be subjected to pay the public debt;—from which we can scarcely obtain a support for the real necessities of our families, I am content; <hi>provided</hi> we are not subjected to an <hi>assessment,</hi> which would soon involve us in new troubles. Should they rather prefer that mode pointed out by Congress, which certainly will place the greatest burden on the rich and luxurious, I shall for my own part perfectly acquiesce in their choice, <hi>provided</hi> the laws are so calculated, as not to subject the private houses of citi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zens to <hi>search warrants,</hi> which never ought to be permited in a <hi>free state,</hi> for any thing short of <hi>felony,</hi> as it wears the highest badge of <hi>tyranny</hi> that can possibly be exhibited.</p>
            <p>The citizens of this state have long been anxious for a new mode of taxation, and I am for my own part willing that mode should be fairly left to their option and choice.

            <p>In the <hi>second place,</hi> if these states expect to maintain their <hi>sovereignty, freedom</hi> and <hi>independence,</hi> they ought carefully and explicitly to instruct their representatives to pay the strictest regard to the articles of our foederal union, and to regulate all their public acts agreeable thereto, as they are the <hi>palladium</hi> of all our civil rights and privileges, and the only band of our <hi>union,</hi> which they should strictly keep <hi>inviolate,</hi> as we regard our PUBLIC FAITH. And I submit it to the wisdom of the legislature of the state whether it may not answer very salutary purposes that a constant cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>respondence be supported between the several assemblies of the states, and a uniformity maintained in their instructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons to the Delegates of Congress upon any general grand and important concerns which relate to all the states in the <hi>union.</hi>

            <head>Remarks on a Pamphlet, entituled, &amp;c.</head>
            <p>THE articles of our foederal union were drawn up by Congress, and adopted by the states, amidst the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fusions</hi> of a most <hi>bloody, cruel,</hi> and <hi>unnatural</hi> war, when the attention of Congress who drew, and the states who adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them, was frequently drawn off by continual <hi>alarms, burning of towns, slaughter</hi> and <hi>bloodshed:</hi> No marvel then that every inconveniency attending them when reduced into practice, could not be foreseen, either by those who drew, or those who adopted them; at which period, it would not have been well accepted, had any one discovered, and had ventured to call into question, the propriety of any one of the thirteen articles of our confederation.</p>
            <p>It may therefore be adviseable, now we are released from the distressing scenes of war, deliberately to examine, revise, correct and amend them, in every instance, in which when reduced into practice, they may be found—inconsistent with each other—not capable of being carried into execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion—or inconsistent with the general sense and understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those who adopted them. And every man not an enemy to his country, who in any measure tenders its peace and future happiness, will readily give his consent, if the present articles of our foederal union are found on a <hi>fair trial,</hi> deficient, in either of the foregoing particulars, that they should with <hi>care</hi> and <hi>due deliberation,</hi> be revised, corrected, and amended. For, as a late writer observes, "No go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment has the prerogative to be <hi>immutable</hi>—No power how respectable soever, <hi>created <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="3 letters">

            </p>
            <p>The author of the dissertation on which I remark, has not proposed any one alteration of the articles of our foede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral union thro'out his whole dissertation, but what he pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses for the enlargement of the powers of Congress, by which it is very evident he has high notions of <hi>prerogative</hi> in those who <hi>govern,</hi> how much soever <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>The Honorable Continental Congress having stiled the Confederacy in the <hi>first</hi> article, THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA; by the <hi>second</hi> they have taken due care to se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure the rights of the separate states in the following words:</p>
            <p>
               <hi>"Each state retains its</hi> SOVEREIGNTY, FREEDOM, <hi>and</hi> IN<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>DEPENDENCE, and every <hi>power, jurisdiction</hi> and <hi>right,</hi> not <hi>expressly</hi> delegated to the <hi>United States in Congress assembled."</hi> Every power therefore not <hi>expressly</hi> delegated to Congress by the articles of confederation, still remains to be exercised by the states separately: and in this consists their <hi>sovereign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, freedom</hi> and <hi>independence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It cannot be difficult to determine what powers the states have <hi>expressly</hi> delegated to Congress, a careful review of the <hi>

               <hi>doubtfully</hi> expressed, they ought as soon as possible to be explained to the sense and understanding which Congress had when they <hi>draughted,</hi> and which the states had when they <hi>adopted</hi> them. Or if on a <hi>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ir trial</hi> it appears that Congress are not vested with all those powers necessary to execute the grand and important ends and designs for which the states entered into confederation, the powers of Congress most certainly must be enlarged, with that care and caution necessary on so important occasion.—But for Congress to <hi>assume,</hi> or for the states to <hi>submit,</hi> to any extension of power, beyond the powers delegated to Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress, will have an effectual tendency to <hi>subvert</hi> the consti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution, and destroy what the states highly value, <abbr>viz.</abbr> their own <hi>sovereignty, freedom,</hi> and <hi>independence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>The author of that dissertation on which I am about to remark, says, fol.5, <hi>"The supreme authority"</hi> (by which he means Congress) <hi>"must have the power of making war and peace.—of appointing armies and navies."</hi> These powers by the 9th article are expresslyd elegated—<hi>"of appointing officers civil and military."</hi> Congress in draughting the articles of our foederal union, reserved in their own hands the right of appointing the <hi>general</hi> officers of our armies.—The officers of our navies, when we have any in existence, and the states have <hi>expressly</hi> delegated that power to them, to whom in fact it with great propriety belongs, and could not be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised in any other way but by the supreme authority of the commonwealth.—But it never entered into their minds I presume, as it is not even suggested i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the articles, their having any power of appointing the <hi>civil officers</hi> of the states, which is a <hi>prerogative,</hi> I presume, the states never will resign, so long as they have any desire to retain their sovereignty, freedom, and independence.—Indeed was the bestowment of places of <hi>bonor</hi> and <hi>profit</hi> the gift of the su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme authority of the states, let it be <hi>King, Congress, State<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holder,
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:018782_0008_0FA8154E6D3BAA88"/>
Regent,</hi> or <hi>Dictator,</hi> or by what name soever called, they would (so long as mankind have any fondness for <hi>ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nor,</hi> and the <hi>emoluments of office</hi>) have it in their power to <hi>bribe</hi> the assembly of the states, and every one who oppose any usurped authority or undue extension of power beyond the limits of the constitution by which they are governed; but in a <hi>republican</hi> government it saps it to the very founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. So long as all public measures are open to the exa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination of the body of the electors, and the bestowment of places of crust left to their representatives, and the emolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of office kept within reasonable bounds, so long a commonwealth may be governed with safety, in peace and good order; but grant to the supreme authority in any form of government whatever, the sole prerogative of the bestow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of all places civil and military, the prerogative of annexing the emoluments of office, and the bestowment of <hi>pensions,</hi> and their subjects are slaves to all intents and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses whatever.—True it is a people may be happy under any form of government, so long as <hi>good men</hi> govern, but whenever they become corrupt—if vested with the power of bestowing all offices civil and military, and at the same time they hold the purse-strings, or which is the same thing, have such grants of money settled for life as will enable the chief magistrate, or supreme authority, to grant <hi>pensions,</hi> to such as will be the tools and creatures of his court—no matter what the form of government is, or whether govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by a <hi>King</hi> or <hi>Congress,</hi> whenever the supreme authority becomes corrupt, and are desirous of extending their pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er beyond the bounds prescribed by the constitution, they always have it in their power to effect it. This author pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeds and says. <hi>"They must have the power of making contracts—emitting, coining, and borrowing money—of regulating trade, and making treaties with foreign powers—of establishing post<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>offices.</hi>—These powers Congress are already <hi>expressly</hi> vested
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:018782_0008_0FA8154E6D3BAA88"/>
with by the articles of confederation; but these do not seem fully to satisfy the desire of this author. He then proceeds and says, <hi>"In short of doing every thing, which the well being of the commonwealth may require, and which is not compatible, to any particular state, all which require money, and cannot be effected without it, they must therefore of</hi> NECES<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SITY <hi>be vested with the power of</hi> TAXATION."</p>
            <p>This author may remember the Honorable Continental Congress drew up the articles of our foederal union, they doubtless well understood what powers were necessary to be vested in their hands, <hi>"which the well being of the common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth required, and which was not compatible to any particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar state,"</hi> at least they understood that matter as well as this author can be supposed to understand it; at the same time they fully understood the foundation of our oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the unconstitutional measures of the British parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and they well knew the confidence placed in them by the states, as the <hi>guardians</hi> of all our civil and natural rights, and they then retained in their own hands, by the articles of our foederal union, all those powers they thought neces<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sary to be lodged in their hands, which we could with safety commit to them, and still the states retain their <hi>sovereignty, freedom,</hi> and <hi>independence,</hi> and they are all <hi>judiciously</hi> and very <hi>expressly</hi> pointed out in the 9th articles, <abbr>viz.</abbr> "The sole and exclusive right and power of determining on peace and war—of sending and receiving embassadors—entering into trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and alliances—of establishing rules for deciding in all cases, what captures on land and water shall be legal, and in what manner prizes taken by land or naval forces in the service of the United States shall be divided or appropriated—of granting letters of marque and reprisals in times of peace—appointing cour<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I would just recite a few passages from a late writer on the civil constitution of England, who says, "The king of England has the prerogative of commanding armies, and equipping fleets—but without the concurrence of his parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment he cannot maintain them—he can bestow places and employments—but without his parliament he cannot pay the salleries annexed to them—he can declare war—but without his parliament it is impossible for him to carry it on—in a word, the royal prerogative, destitute as it is, of <hi>imposing taxes,</hi> is like a ship completely equipt, but from which the parliament at pleasure can draw off all the wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and leave it aground, or set it a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

that will satisfy this author, I am willing they should have the very same, <abbr>viz.</abbr> "A few hereditary duties on the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portation of wool, a branch of which in the reign of George I. was fixed at seven thousand pounds—a duty of two shil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lings on every ton of wine imported—the wrecks of ships, the owners unknown—whales and sturgeons thrown on the coast—swans swimming on public rivers—and a few feudal relicks, compose the whole <hi>appropriated</hi> revenue of the crown of England—and if these will satisfy this author, without the power of <hi>taxation,</hi> for my own part should be content they should be granted to Congress; that in no one instance, either in point of <hi>prerogative,</hi> or <hi>appropriated revenues,</hi> they should be less respectable than the monarch of Britain.</p>

            <p>This author doth not even pretend we have already vest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Congress with the power of <hi>taxation,</hi> but says they must be vested with it from <hi>necessity,</hi> and urges reasons to support that <hi>necessity;</hi> but there are others <hi>weak</hi> and <hi>silly,</hi> enough to assert, they are already vested with that power, and found their opinion on these words in the 9th article, "to ascer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain

            <p>The true end and design of our confederation I take to be this, <abbr>viz.</abbr> To unite the strength of the separate states under Congress as their <hi>general Head,</hi> and to delegate to them the direction of the operations of our military and naval forces against the power of Great-Britain.—And this I take it was the general sense and understanding of the states who adopted the articles of our foederal union, and the whole tenor of the articles themselves support this opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion.—Congress are to determine the number of <hi>troops</hi> ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary for the <hi>service</hi> of the states.—What <hi>service?</hi> The <hi>ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice</hi> of the war and general defence—and for that end they were to make requisition to each state for their <hi>quota,</hi> "and to ascertain the necessary sums of money to be raised for the <hi>service"</hi> of the war, and to appropriate and apply the same; that matter not being <hi>compalible to any particular state,</hi> by constitution is vested in congress, whose right it properly is, and is <hi>expressly</hi> delegated to them.—But this our author cannot put up with, without their being vested with the power of <hi>taxation:</hi> who says, fol. 6, <hi>"This would make all payments dependant on</hi> THIRTEEN POPULAR ASSEMBLIES."

the impost act, which was to have been collected by officers appointed by Congress, and applied at their discretion, in which the states could have no power to appropriate to the payment of their quota of debt contracted during the war, agreeable to the 8th article, the author can better say than I can pretend—but that the depreciation of bills—failure of public credit, and many bankruptcies ensued before the impost was asked for by Congress, or denied by Rhode<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>Island, are facts that are notorious, which many attribute to the want of seasonable and adequate taxation, which, cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ating a demand, would at least have retarded the deprecia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of our bills.

            <p>Some have suggested, that this author may possibly be employed, by our honorable Congress, to try how far the citizens of these states would submit to such arbitrary and despotic measures: But such suggestions I reject with con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt and disdain.

as our author appears to be, to effect the design; and that without ever once moving to the assemblies of the states for any enlargement of their powers; which no doubt, they would most readily comply with, if necessary.

               </gap>.—I rather think him some gentleman of a <hi>sovereign, arbitrary, tyrannical</hi> turn of mind, and unhappily <hi>vindictive;</hi> of which he has given a convincing evidence, in fol. 27, in these words—<hi>"Further, I propose, that if the execution of any act or order of the supreme authority shall be opposed by force, in any of the states (which God forbid) it shall be lawful for Congress to send into such state a sufficient force to suppress it."</hi>—Here, again, our author <hi>interlardes</hi> this <hi>sanguinary proposal</hi> with a short ejaculatory prayer to Almighty God; but then I do not understand him to mean to prevent the operation of his proposal, but that God would <hi>forbid</hi> or <hi>Prevent</hi> any state from opposing, by force, the execution of any act of Congress: Which, from the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent views I have of the temper and disposition of any of our states, there is not the least danger of; before so long as they regulate their requisitions by the articles of our foederal union; which Congress themselves <hi>drafted,</hi> and which the states have solemnly adopted. But should Congress ever
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:018782_0019_0FA815575C553838"/>
make any resolutions contrary to the articles of our foederal union, through inadvertence; as this author says, fol. 24, <hi>"I know that supreme authorities are</hi> LIABLE <hi>to err as well as lesser ones;"</hi> or should they, from lust of power, and spirit of domination, become <hi>"over-heated, violent, oppressive, and very tyrannical,"</hi> (as in fol. 26 he owns they may) I should think it their indispensible duty to <hi>resist all unconstitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional extension of power;</hi> although not unto <hi>blood.</hi> But should the states adopt this <hi>sanguinary proposal</hi> of our au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor, Congress would <hi>constitutionally</hi> be vested with power to enter with an armed force, and shed the blood of any of our sister states, merely for supporting the <hi>constitutional rights</hi> of the states. As Congress have wisely avoided all <hi>sanguinary</hi> measures, in drafting the articles of our union, I should not think it below the dignity of their high station, to manifest their disapprobation of so <hi>sanguinary</hi> a proposal.</p>
            <p>This proposal gave me a more violent shock, as I hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to read it just as the news arrived, that 1500 of our continental troops, with a proper train of artillery, were on full march for <hi>Philadelphia</hi> to suppress the turbulent beha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour of a part of the <hi>Philadelphia</hi> line of the army, and to protect the honorable Continental Congress from their in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults. If the form of civil government in that state is so <hi>lax,</hi> and their citizens not disposed to support it against in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sults; as the officers of that state are on <hi>half pay</hi> during life, and they can support a body of troops with a small addi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional expence, it may be well for them to take that method to do it; but I do not think it adviseable or necessary for the states to support an army for that purpose: A mild administration rarely wants an armed force to support it: The rectitude of the measures of Congress, and the Assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies of the states, will always afford them the surest protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and wherever the civil power of a state cannot sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port itself from insult, without a military force to awe their subjects into submission, there is much reason to fear either
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:018782_0019_0FA815575C553838"/>
their civil constitution is deficient, or something is wrong in the administration.—Standing armies may be necessary to support tyranny, oppression, and arbitrary government; but to have recourse to arms in a civil government, is shocking to humanity!—They may be necessary with a <hi>felon,</hi> an <hi>individual;</hi> but with a sister state, a whole com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity of the same family, the bare mentioning of arms presents to my view the bloody scenes in which we have been involved by our <hi>parent state!</hi>—The unhappy effects of which, time itself will not repair, or obliterate from our minds.</p>
            <p>I think none who duly attends to the whole scope and drift of this author, but will easily discover his design is to subvert our present constitution, and to introduce in its room, a government more arbitrary, sovereign, and despotic. His dividing Congress into two Chambers, he seems to think, will make them <hi>wonderful wise;</hi> and is much better disposed towards them than when in one house, and subjects of <hi>po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pular elections.</hi> However, he finds some difficulty even then: He has found out these two Chambers, <hi>equal,</hi> in all respects, may <hi>"grow jealous and ill-natured, and after all their information and advice, grow out of humour and insincere, and no concurrence can be obtained."</hi> But he has luckily found out a remedy even in that case, <abbr>

               <hi>"Sit still, and do nothing, till they get into better humour."</hi> This I think as bad a situ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, as to have the proceedings of Congress suspended a small period by the vote of a <hi>single state.</hi> But before he ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rives to the bottom of page 22, he has discovered a remedy for to cure the two Houses of their <hi>

               <g ref="char:endq">”</g> (Fol. 22.) Here our author
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:018782_0020_0FA81558C73FF118"/>
has wholly dropt his <hi>mask:</hi> The two Chambers being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished with A DICTATOR by the joint election of both Houses, he is to remain <hi>Dictator</hi> until the Houses can agree to displace him; which period, I presume, will never ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rive; for he is to be vested with the <hi>power of both Houses,</hi> so long as they remain out of humour; of course the power of <hi>taxation</hi> will be his <hi>exclusive prerogative;</hi> by means whereof, he will have it in his power to keep the two Houses out of humour, until he makes himself a PERPETUAL DICTATOR. There is no chimera in all this—our author is consistent in his own plan—and his views are <hi>apparent</hi>—to reduce us to an ABSOLUTE MONARCHY; and his plan, carried into exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, will effect the thing.</p>
            <p>I trust an <hi>absolute monarch</hi> is not what would be the choice of my fellow citizens: It most certainly would not be my choice, unless I could be assured always of a <hi>wise</hi> and <hi>good Prince.</hi> In a commonwealth, if small, and the electors per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonally acquainted with public characters, the people may enjoy great happiness; but when a commonwealth becomes <hi>numerous</hi>—their concerns <hi>great and important</hi>—the desire of <hi>riches, honors</hi> and <hi>power</hi> increasing with their numbers,—if the electors have not the means to obtain the knowledge of the public characters of rulers, by their votes given when acting in their public character, the choice of the electors (which, in general, in these northern states, is the main body of the citizens) will be very precarious and uncertain: Discontent and uneasiness will ensue—factions form and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease—frequent alterations and change in civil rulers will ensue;—the greatest calamity that can befal an elective state, or commonwealth, as no man, fit to <hi>rule</hi> or <hi>govern,</hi> will suffer himself to be <hi>mob'd</hi> in, and <hi>mob'd</hi> out, according as the several parties and factions succeed by their intrigues in courting the populace, and imposing on the credulity of their electors: And what will next ensue, courts of justice
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:018782_0020_0FA81558C73FF118"/>
may, in the same manner, be contaminated,—which must compleat their ruin. An open line of conduct in a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monwealth, subject to the examination of the electors, is the only <hi>barrier</hi> against <hi>tyranny,</hi>—which, in a common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, is the most cruel and oppressive of any species of ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny whatever.</p>
            <p>The form of government planned by Congress, and adopted by the states, is the only form we could adopt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der our circumstances: And the honor and digni<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

But as every de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viation from the articles of our foederal union makes a dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous precedent in future, the defects in the articles of confederation can be known only by <hi>practice:</hi> And it is time enough to make alterations in our system of government, when the defects are made evident.</p>
            <p>I must now revert to some things said by this author, which I have passed over, before I conclude these remarks. He says, (fol. 9,) <hi>"Another great object of government, is the apportionment of burdens and benefits,—and that an ill ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionment will be an everlasting source of uneasiness and discon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent."</hi>—Again, <hi>"The value of lands may be a good rule, but the ascertainment of that value is impracticable; no assessment can be made which will not be liable to exceptions and debates."</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This observation of our author is doubtless right; the same objections arose in my mind when I first read the 8th article of our foederal union. And our author says, in fol. 10, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>"That the number of living souls, or human persons, of whatever age, sex, or condition, will afford us a rule which will forever encrease or decrease with the real wealth of the states; and, of course, will be a perpetual rule, not ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of corruption by any circumstances of future time."</hi>

This mode of proportioning the quota of debt <hi>first</hi> sug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gested to the public by this author, is <hi>since</hi> recommended by Congress, with this alteration, <abbr>viz.</abbr> Two fifth parts of the slaves to be exempted from the <hi>capitation;</hi> the reasons of which exemption do not at present occur to my mind. If I mistake not, Congress have laid a prohibition on the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion of <hi>African slaves;</hi> but this exemption seems rather an encouragement to the owners to progagate them in pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference to <hi>horses</hi> or other <hi>stock;</hi> and they are improved for the same purposes in tilling ground in the southern, as oxen are in the northern states, and supported at less expence through our long and tedious winters: And at present I cannot see the reasons of the exemption of two fifth parts from the capitation; but otherwise, this proposal of our author, I acknowledge, would be perfectly reasonable, was all the lands ceded by the late treaty, which were not actual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly purchased or conquered by the Crown antecedent to the cession, to be considered as the joint interest of all the states in the confederation: But if the western lands ceded by the late treaty, not purchased or conquered by the Crown <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

            <p>I well know the Princes of Europe have come into some compacts, that when the subjects of any Prince make a dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coverty of lands heretofore unknown to the nations of Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope, whether inhabited by any of the human race or not, they take possession of it, in some formal manner, for their Prince; either by giving it some <hi>christian</hi> or <hi>saint's</hi> name, setting up a crucifix, &amp;c. Such sort of compacts, made by the Princes of Europe, may be binding on them on the eastern side of the Atlantic, but do not appear in the same light to the Americans, who, heretofore, have been wont to believe, <hi>"That God hath made of one blood, all nations of the earth, and hath determined the bounds of their habitation:"</hi> And many of us, to this day, think the natives who were the <hi>first discoverers,</hi> and had the right of <hi>prime occupancy,</hi> un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less they have sold the same, or that it has been justly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered, are still vested with the right of soil; and that a patent from the Crown will not justly give us a right to drive them from their habitations.

            <p>As for those unhappy people termed <hi>Loyalists,</hi> who have shed the blood of their country, and robbed, plundered and distressed their friends, their estates are but an inconsiderable compensation for their repeated outrages, they never ought to be permitted to reside among us, and I leave them to be punished by their own reflections.
