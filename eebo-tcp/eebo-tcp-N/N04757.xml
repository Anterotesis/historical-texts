            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE Ruin of <hi>Satan</hi>'s miserable King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and the Advancement of the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versal and happy Reign of CHRIST on the Earth, were included and hinted in the <hi>Sentence</hi> denounced on the <hi>Serpent,</hi> that <hi>the Seed of the Woman should bruise his Head.</hi> What was a <hi>terrible Threatning</hi> to <hi>Satan,</hi> in the sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prized Ears of <hi>our first guilty Parents,</hi> implied a <hi>joyful Prophecy,</hi> to keep them from Despair, and enliven their Hopes for themselves and their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scendants, of obtaining by <hi>this Seed of her's</hi> an eternal Triumph over him who had so sadly foiled them. And 'tis likely, their Hope and Faith im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately arose, laid hold on the reviving Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, earnestly desired it's happy Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and transmitted it to their Posterity.</p>
            <p>But tho' this Prophecy was at first only deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in the Form of a <hi>Threatning</hi> to <hi>Satan</hi>; it was afterwards directly given in the Form of a <hi>Promise</hi> to <hi>Abraham,</hi> tho' still in general Terms, that <hi>in his Seed should all the Nations of the Earth
<pb facs="unknown:005938_0003_0000000000000000"/>
be blessed.</hi> Yet this general Promise was more clearly by Degrees explained in the following A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to mean a DIVINE KING, no other than the SON OF GOD assuming <hi>Human Nature</hi> of the Seed of <hi>Abraham, Isaac, Iacob</hi> and <hi>David</hi>; that should be born of a <hi>Virgin</hi> in <hi>Bethlehem</hi> of <hi>Iudah</hi>; and at first despised, abused, rejected and put to Death; but should rise to immortal Life, ascend to Heaven, and thence extend his blessed Kingdom over all Nations; not by outward Force, but in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward overcoming Influence, by his <hi>Word</hi> and SPIRIT making them <hi>his willing People in the Day of his Power</hi>; and reigning in glorious Light and Holiness and Love and Peace for ever: And the Advancement of this universal and hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py Reign has been the earnest <hi>Desire</hi> and <hi>Prayer</hi> of the <hi>Saints</hi> in all Ages to the present Day.</p>
            <p>But how great the Honour, and how lively the Encouragement given in Scripture to those <hi>their Prayers</hi>; by representing them as offered by CHRIST himself with the fragrant <hi>Incense</hi> of his own Merits and Intercession, on the <hi>Golden Altar before the Throne,</hi> and ascending together in one grateful Perfume to GOD! And how chearing to every Saint is that Promise of his,— <hi>From the Rising of the Sun, even to the going down of the same, my Name shall be great among the</hi> Gentiles, <hi>and in every Place Incense shall be offered unto my Name, and a pure Offering!</hi> How
<pb facs="unknown:005938_0004_0000000000000000"/>
pleasing to GOD and the <hi>heavenly Hosts</hi> to see, as the Sun goes round the Globe, this grateful In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cense rising from every Part on high! And the more extensive and incessant are these Prayers, as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cending from the Circle of the Earth, the more does this blessed Promise go into it's desired Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment, and the holy GOD is more pleas'd and glorified.</p>
            <p>To promote the <hi>Increase, Concurrency</hi> and <hi>Constancy</hi> of these acceptable <hi>Prayers,</hi> is the great Intention both of the pious <hi>Memorial</hi> of our reverend and dear <hi>Brethren</hi> in <hi>Scotland,</hi> and of the worthy <hi>Author</hi> of this exciting <hi>Essay.</hi> And this Design we can't but recommend to all who desire the coming of that blissful <hi>Kingdom</hi> in it's promised Extent and Glory, in this wretched World.</p>
            <p>As to the Author's ingenious Observations on the <hi>Prophecies,</hi> we entirely leave them to the Reader's Judgment: With only observing, thô it is the Apprehension of many learned Men, that there is to be a very <hi>general Slaughter</hi> of the <hi>Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses</hi> of CHRIST about the Time of their finishing their Testimony to the pure Worship and Truths of the Gospel, about 3 or 4 Years before the <hi>se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth Angel</hi> sounds his Trumpet for the Ruin of <hi>Antichrist</hi>;—yet we cannot see that this is any just Objection against our joint and earnest <hi>Prayers</hi> for the glorious Age succeeding, or for the hasten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of it.</p>
            <p>
               <pb facs="unknown:005938_0005_0000000000000000"/>For if such a terrible Time is coming in <hi>Europe,</hi> which we in depending <hi>America</hi> are like to share in; the more Need we have of joining in earnest and constant Prayers for extraordinary suffering Graces for ourselves and others. And that such a Time is coming on the <hi>Members</hi> of CHRIST, is no more an Objection against their <hi>Prayers</hi> for the hastening of the following Glory, than it was before the Incarnation of <hi>Him</hi> their <hi>Head,</hi> that his most bitter Sufferings were to preceed the Spread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of his joyous Kingdom among the Nations. And the nearer the Day approaches, the more Need we have to be awakened to continual <hi>Watchfulness</hi> and <hi>Prayer.</hi>
            </p>

There never happen'd any Thing, from the Time of the Prophet <hi>Zechariah</hi> to the Coming of Christ, to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer this Prophecy: And it can have no Fulfilment but either in the Calling of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> in and after the Days of the <hi>Apostles,</hi> of in the future glorious Enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Church of God in the <hi>latter Ages</hi> of the World, so often foretold by the Prophets of the old Testament, and by the Prophet <hi>Zechariah</hi> in particular, in the latter Part of this Prophecy. 'Tis most probable, that what the Spirit of God has chief Respect to, is that <hi>last</hi> and greatest Enlargement and most glorious Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of the Church of God on Earth; in the Benefits of which especially, the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation were to have a Share, and a very eminent and distinguishing Share. There is a great Agreement between what is here said, and other Prophecies, that must manifestly have Respect to the Church's Latter-Day-Glory: As that in Isai. lx.2, 3, 4. <hi>The Lord shall arise upon thee, and his Glory shall be seen upon thee: And the Gentiles shall come to thy Light, and Kings to the Brightness of thy Rising. Lift up thine Eyes round about, and see; all they gather themselves together, they come to thee.</hi> That whole Chapter, beyond all Dispute, has Respect to the most glorious State of the Church of God on Earth. So Chap. lxvi.8. <hi>Shall the Earth be made to bring forth in one Day? Shall a Nation be born at once?</hi> — Ver. 10. <hi>Rejoice ye with</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and be glad with her, all ye that
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:005938_0011_0000000000000000"/>
love her.</hi> Ver. 12. <hi>I will extend Peace to her like a Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and the Glory of the Gentiles like a flowing Stream.</hi>— Micah. 4. at the Beginning; <hi>But in the last Days it shall come to pass, that the Mountain of the House of the Lord shall be established in the Top of the Mountains, and it shall be exalted above the Hills, and People shall flow unto it; and many Nations shall come and say, Come, and let us go up unto the Mountain of the Lord, and to the House of the God of</hi> Jacob.— <hi>And he shall judge among many People, and rebuke strong Nations afar off; and they shall beat their Swords into Plow-shares, and their Spears into pruning Hooks; Nation shall not lift up Sword against Nation, neither shall they learn War any more.</hi>—See also <hi>Isai.</hi> ii. at the Beginning.—There has been nothing yet brought to pass, in any Measure to answer these Prophecies. And as the Prophecy in my Text and the following Verse does agree with them, so there is Reason to think it has a Respect to the same Times. And indeed there is a remarkable Agreement in the Description given thro'<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Chapter, with the Representations made of those Times elsewhere in the Prophets; as may be seen by comparing Ver. 3. with <hi>Isai.</hi> lx.14. — Ver. 4 with <hi>Isai.</hi> lxv.20, 22. and xxxiii.24.— Ver. 6, 7, 8. with <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxvii.2, 11, 12, 21.— Ver. 7. with <hi>Isai.</hi> xliii.5, 6. and xlix.12 and lix.10. — Ver. 12, 13. with <hi>H<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>So that however the Prophet, in some Things that are said in this Chapter, may have Respect to future Smiles of Heaven on the Nation of the <hi>Iews,</hi> lately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned from the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity, and resettled in
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:005938_0012_0000000000000000"/>
the Land of <hi>Canaan,</hi> in a great Increase of their Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers and Wealth, and the Return of more Captives from <hi>Chaldea</hi> and other Countries, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> yet the Spirit of God has doubtless Respect to Things far <hi>greater</hi> than these, and of which these were but faint Resemblances. We find it common in the Prophecies of the old Tes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tament, that when the Prophets are speaking of the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours and Blessings of God on the <hi>Iews,</hi> attending or following their Return from the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity, the Spirit of God takes Occasion from thence to speak of the incomparably greater Blessings on the Church, that shall attend and follow her Deliverance from the spiritual or mystical <hi>Babylon,</hi> of which those were a Type; and is, as it were, led away to speak almost wholly of these latter, and vastly greater Things, so as to seem to forget the Former.</p>
            <p>And whereas the Prophet, in this Chapter, speaks of God's <hi>bringing his People again from the East and West to</hi> Jerusalem (Ver. 7, 8.) <hi>And Multitudes of all Nations taking hold of the Skirts of the</hi> Jews; so far as we may suppose that this means literally that Nation of the Posterity of <hi>Iacob,</hi> it can't have chief Respect to any Return of <hi>Iews</hi> from <hi>Babylon</hi> and other Countries, in those ancient Times before Christ; for no such Things as are here spoken of, attended any such Return: But it must have Respect to the great Calling and Gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the <hi>Iews</hi> into the Fold of <hi>Christ,</hi> and their being received to the Blessings of his Kingdom, after the Fall of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> or the Destruction of mystical <hi>Babylon.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the Text we have an Account <hi>how</hi> this future glorious Advancement of the Church of God should be brought on, or introduced; <hi>viz.</hi> By great Multitudes in different Towns and Countries taking up a <hi>joint Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solution,</hi>
               <pb n="5" facs="unknown:005938_0013_0000000000000000"/>
and coming into an express and visible <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that they will, by united and extraordinary <hi>Prayer,</hi> seek to God that he would come and manifest himself, and grant the Tokens and Fruits of his gracious Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence.</p>
            <p>Particularly we may observe,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The <hi>Duty,</hi> with the Attendance on which the glorious Event foretold shall be brought on; <hi>viz.</hi> The Duty of <hi>Prayer.</hi>—Prayer, some suppose, is here to be taken <hi>synechdochically,</hi> for the Whole of the Worship of God; Prayer being a principal Part of the Worship of the Church of God, in the Days of the Gospel, when Sacrifices are abolished: And so, that this is to be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstood only as a Prophecy of a great <hi>Revival</hi> of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and of the true Worship of God among his visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble People, the <hi>Accession</hi> of others to the Church, and turning of Multitudes from Idolatry to the Worship of the true God. But it appears to me reasonable, to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that something more special is intended, with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the Duty of Prayer; considering that Prayer is here expresly and and repeatedly mention'd; and also considering how parallel this Place is with many other Prophecies, that speak of an extraordinary Spirit of Prayer, as preceeding and introducing that glorious Day of Revival of Religion, and Advancement of the Church's Peace and Prosperity, so often foretold (which I shall have Occasion to mention hereafter) and parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly the Agreableness of what is here said, with what is said afterwards by the same Prophet, of the <hi>pouring out of a Spirit of Grace and Supplications,</hi> as that with which this great Revival of Religion shall begin, <hi>Chap.</hi> xii.10.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:005938_0014_0000000000000000"/>2. The <hi>Good,</hi> that shall be sought by Prayer; which is GOD Himself.—It is said once and again, <hi>They shall go to pray before the Lord, and to</hi> SEEK THE LORD OF HOSTS. This is the <hi>Good</hi> they ask for and seek by Prayer, <hi>The Lord of Hosts</hi> Himself.—To <hi>seek God,</hi> as the Expression may perhaps be sometimes used in Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>y signify no more than seeking the Favour or Mercy of God. And if it be taken so here, <hi>praying before the Lord,</hi> and <hi>seeking the Lord of Hosts,</hi> must be look'd upon as synonymous Expressions. And it must be confess'd to be a common Thing in Scripture, to signify the same Thing repeatedly, by various Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the same Import, for the greater Emphasis.— But certainly that Expression of <hi>seeking the Lord,</hi> is very commonly used to signify something more than meerly, in general, to seek some Mercy of God: It implies, that <hi>God Himself</hi> is the great <hi>Good</hi> desired and sought after; that the Blessings pursued are God's gracious Presence, the blessed Manifestations of him, Union and Intercourse with him; or, in short. God's Manifestations and Communica<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> his holy Spirit. Thus the Psalmist <hi>desired God, thirsted after Him,</hi> and <hi>sought Him.</hi> Psal. lxiii.1, 2, 8. <hi>O God, thou art my God; early will I</hi> seek Thee. <hi>My Flesh longeth for Thee, in a dry and thirsty Land, where no Water is, to see thy Power and thy Glory, so as I have seen Thee in the Sanctuary.—My Soul followeth hard af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Thee.</hi>—Psal. lxxiii.25. <hi>Whom have I in Heaven but Thee? And there is none upon Earth that I desire be sides Thee.</hi> The Psalmist earnestly pursued after God<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> 
               <hi>his Soul thirsted after Him, he stretched forth his Hand's unto Him,</hi> &amp;c. Psal. cxliii.6. And therefore it is in Scripture the peculiar Character of the Saints, that they
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:005938_0015_0000000000000000"/>
are <hi>those that seek God.</hi> Psal. xxiv.6. <hi>This is the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration of them that</hi> seek HIM. Psal. lxix.32. <hi>Your Heart shall live that</hi> seek GOD. And in many other Places. If the Expression in the Text be understood agreable to this Sense, then by <hi>seeking the Lord of Hosts,</hi> we must understand a seeking, that God who had with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn, as it were hid himself, for a long Time, would return to his Church, and grant the Tokens and Fruits of his gracious Presence, and those blessed Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations of his Spirit to his People, and to Mankind on the Earth, which he had often promis'd, and which his Church had long waited for.</p>
            <p>And it seems reasonable, to understand the Phrase, <hi>seeking the Lord of Hosts,</hi> in this Sense here; and not as merely signifying the same Thing with praying to God: Not only because the Expression is repeatedly added to <hi>praying before the Lord,</hi> in the Text, as signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying something more; but also because the Phrase, taken in this Sense, is exactly agreable to other pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel prophetick Representations. Thus God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's seeking, by earnest Prayer, the promised Restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Church of God, after the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity, and the great Apostacy that occasion'd it, is called their SEEKING GOD, <hi>and</hi> SEARCHING <hi>for Him</hi>; and God's granting this promised Revival and Restoration is called his being FOUND <hi>of them.</hi> Jer. xxix.10,—14. <hi>For thus saith the Lord, that after se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venty Years he accomplished at</hi> Babylon<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>

From the Representation made in the Prophecy, it appears ratio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal to suppose, that it will be fulfilled something after this Manner; First, that there shall be given much of a Spirit of Prayer to God's People, in many Places, disposing them to come into an express <hi>Agreement,</hi> uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly to pray to God in an extraordinary Manner, that he would appear for the Help of his Church, and in Mercy to Mankind, and <hi>pour out his Spirit, revive his Work,</hi> and advance his spiritual <hi>Kingdom</hi> in the World, as he has promised; And that this Disposition to such Prayer, and Union in it, will gradually spread more and m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

which at length will gradually be introduced a <hi>Revival</hi> of <hi>Religion,</hi> and a Disposition to greater Engagedness in the Worship and Service of God, amongst his pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessing People; That this being observed, will be the Means of awakening others, making them sensible of the Wants of their Souls, and exciting in them a great Concern for their spiritual and everlasting Good, and putting them upon earnestly crying to God for spiritual Mercies, and disposing them to join with God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in that extraordinary seeking and serving of God, which they shall see them engaged in; And that in this Manner <hi>Religion</hi> shall be <hi>propagated,</hi> 'till the Awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing reaches those that are in the <hi>highest Stations,</hi> and 'till <hi>whole Nations</hi> be awaken'd, and there be at length an Accession of many of the chief Nations of the World to the Church of God. Thus after the Inhabitants of many Cities of <hi>Israel,</hi> or of God's professing People, have taken up, and pursued a joint Resolution, to go and pray before the Lord, and seek the Lord of Hosts, O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers shall be drawn to worship and serve Him with them; 'till at length <hi>many People</hi> and <hi>strong Nations</hi> shall join themselves to them; and there shall, in Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cess of Time, be a vast Accession to the Church, so that it shall be <hi>ten</hi> Times as large as it was before; yea, at length, all Nations shall be converted unto God.

            </p>
            <p n="4">4. We may observe the <hi>Mode</hi> of their <hi>Union</hi> in this Duty. 'Tis a <hi>visible</hi> Union, an Union by explicit

Agreement, a joint Resolution declared by one to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, come into by being first proposed by some, and readily and expresly fallen in with by others. The In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitants of <hi>one City</hi> shall apply themselves to the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants of <hi>another,</hi> saying, <hi>Let us go,</hi> &amp;c. Those to whom the Motion is made, shall comply with it; the Proposal shall take with many, it shall be a prevailing, spreading Thing; one shall follow another's Example, one and another <hi>shall say, I will go also.</hi> Some suppose, that those Words, <hi>I will go also,</hi> are to be taken as the Words of him that makes the Proposal; as much as to say, I don't propose that to you, which I am not wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly to do my self, I desire <hi>you</hi> to go, and I am ready to go <hi>with you.</hi> But this is to suppose no more to be expressed in these latter Words, than was express'd be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore in the Proposal itself; for these Words, <hi>Let us go,</hi> signify as much, as that I am willing to go, and desire you to go with me. It seems to me much more natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, to understand these latter Words as importing the <hi>Consent</hi> of those to whom the Proposal is made, or the <hi>Reply</hi> of one and another that falls in it. This is much more agreable to the plain Design of the Text, which is to represent the <hi>Concurrence</hi> of great Numbers in this Affair; and more agreable to the Representation made in the next Verse, of one following another, many <hi>taking hold of the Skirt of him that is a</hi> Jew. And tho', if the Words are thus understood, we must suppose an <hi>Ellipsis</hi> in the Text, something understood that is not expressed, as if it had been said, <hi>Those of other Cities shall say,</hi> I will go also;—yet this is not difficult to be supposed; such <hi>Ellipses</hi> are very common in Scripture. We have one exactly parallel with it in J<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p n="5">5. We may observe the <hi>Manner of Prayer</hi> agreed on, or the Manner in which they agree to <hi>engage in</hi> and <hi>per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form</hi> the Duty. <hi>Let us go</hi> speedily <hi>to pray</hi>; or as it is in the Margin, Let us go <hi>continually.</hi> The Words literal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly translated are, <hi>Let us go in going.</hi> Such an Ingemi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation or doubling of Words is very common in the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Language, when it is intended that a Thing shall be very <hi>strongly</hi> expressed; it generally implies the <hi>superlative Degree</hi> of a Thing; as the <hi>Holy of Holies</hi> signifies the most holy: But it commonly denotes, not only the utmost Degree of a Thing, but also the utmost <hi>Certainty</hi>; as when God said to <hi>Abraham. In multiply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, I will multiply thy Seed,</hi> (Gen. xxii.17.) it im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies both that God would <hi>certainly</hi> multiply his Seed, and also multiply it <hi>exceedingly.</hi> So when God said to <hi>Adam, In the Day that thou eatest thereof, in dying thou shalt die</hi> (as the Words are in the Original) it implies, both that he should <hi>surely</hi> die, and also that he should die most <hi>terribly,</hi> should utterly perish, and be destroy'd to the utmost Degree. Yea, sometimes it seems to imply something else still: And in short, as this Inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mination

of Words in the <hi>Hebrew,</hi> in general denotes the Strength of Expression, so it is used to signify almost all those Things that are wont to be signified by the various Forms of strong Speech in other Languages: Sometimes it signifies the utmost Degree of a Thing; sometimes Certainty; sometimes the <hi>Peremptoriness</hi> and <hi>Terribleness</hi> of a Threatning, or the <hi>Greatness</hi> and <hi>Posi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiveness</hi> of a Promise, the <hi>Strictness</hi> of a Command, and the <hi>Earnestness</hi> of a Request.

            <p n="6">6. We may learn from the Tenor of this Prophecy, together with the Context, that this Union in such Prayer is foretold as a <hi>becoming</hi> and <hi>happy</hi> Thing, and that which would be acceptable to God, and attended with glorious Success.</p>
            <p>From the Whole we may infer, That it is a very <hi>sui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table</hi> Thing, and <hi>well-pleasing to God,</hi> for many People, in different Parts of the World, by express <hi>Agreement,</hi> to come into a <hi>visible Union,</hi> in extraordinary, speedy, fervent and constant <hi>Prayer,</hi> for those great Effusions of the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> which shall bring on that <hi>Advancement</hi> of Christ's Church and Kingdom, that God has so often promised shall be in the <hi>latter Ages</hi> of the World.</p>

               <pb n="14" facs="unknown:005938_0022_0000000000000000"/>And so from hence I would infer the <hi>Duty</hi> of God's People, with Regard to the <hi>Memorial</hi> lately sent over into <hi>America,</hi> from <hi>Scotland,</hi> by a Number of Ministers there, proposing a <hi>Method</hi> for such an <hi>Union</hi> as has been spoken of, in extraordinary Prayer for this great Mercy.</p>
            <p>And it being the special Design of this Discourse, to perswade such as are Friends to the Interests of Christ's Kingdom, to a <hi>Compliance</hi> with the Proposal and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest made in that Memorial, I shall first give a short <hi>historical</hi> Account of the <hi>Affair</hi> it relates to, from Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, Papers and Pamphlets, that have come over from <hi>Scotland</hi>; to which I shall annex the <hi>Memorial</hi> it self: And then I shall offer some <hi>Arguments</hi> and <hi>Motives,</hi> tending to induce the Friends of Religion to fall in with what is proposed: And lastly, make Answer to some <hi>Objections</hi> that may possibly be made against it.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>First</hi> of these Things, <hi>viz.</hi> an historical Account of the <hi>Concert,</hi> which the Memorial relates to, the following Observations may give a sufficient View of that Affair.</p>
            <p>In <hi>October,</hi> A. D. 1744, a Number of Ministers in <hi>Scotland,</hi> taking into Consideration the State of God's Church, and of the World of Mankind, judged that the Providence of God, at such a Day, did loudly call such as were concerned for the Welfare of <hi>Zion,</hi> to <hi>united extraordinary</hi> Applications to the God of all Grace, suitably acknowledging Him as the Fountain of all the spiritual Benefits and Blessings of his Church, and ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly praying to Him, that he would <hi>appear in his Glory,</hi> and favour <hi>Zion,</hi> and manifest his Compassion to the World of Mankind, by an abundant Effusion of his <hi>Holy Spirit</hi> on all the Churches, and the whole habitable
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:005938_0023_0000000000000000"/>
Earth, to revive true Religion in all Parts of <hi>Christendom,</hi> and to deliver <hi>all Nations</hi> from their great and mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold spiritual Calamities and Miseries, and bless them with the unspeakable Benefits of the Kingdom of our glorious Redeemer, and <hi>fill the whole Earth with his Glory.</hi> And consulting one another on the Subject, they look'd on <hi>Themselves,</hi> for their own Part, obliged to engage in this Duty; and, as far as in them lay, to persuade <hi>others</hi> to the same: And to endeavour to find out and fix on some <hi>Method,</hi> that should most effectually tend to promote and uphold such extraordinary Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to Heaven among God's People. And after seeking to God by Prayer for Direction, they determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned on the following Method, as what they would con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form to in their own Practice, and propose to be prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tised by others, for the <hi>two Years</hi> next following, <hi>viz.</hi> To set apart some Time on <hi>Saturday-Evening</hi> and <hi>Sab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bath-Morning,</hi> every Week, for the Purpose aforesaid, as other Duties would allow to every one respectively; and more solemnly, the first <hi>Tuesday</hi> of each <hi>Quarter</hi> (beginning with the first Tuesday of <hi>November</hi> then next ensuing) either the whole Day, or Part of the Day, as Persons find themselves disposed, or think their Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances will allow: The Time to be spent either in <hi>private</hi> praying Societies, or in <hi>publick</hi> Meetings, or alone in <hi>secret,</hi> as shall be found most practicable, or judged most convenient, by such as are willing, in some Way or other, to join in this Affair: But not that any should make any Promises, or be looked upon as under strict Bonds in any Respect, constantly and without Fail to observe every one of these Days, whatever their Circumstances should be, or however other Duties and necessary Affairs might interfere; or that Persons should
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:005938_0024_0000000000000000"/>
look upon themselves bound with Regard to these Days in any wise as tho' the Time were holy, or the setting them apart for religious Purposes were established by sacred Authority: But yet, as a proper Guard against Negligence and Unsteadiness, and a prudent Preserva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive from yielding to a Disposition, that Persons might be liable to, through the Prevalence of Indolence and Liftlesness, to excuse themselves on trivial Occasions, it was proposed, That those that unite in this A fair, should resolve with themselves, that if, by urgent Business, or otherwise, they were hindred from joining with others, on the very Day agreed on, yet they would not wholly neglect bearing their Part in the Duty proposed, but would take the first convenient Day fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing, for that Purpose.</p>
            <p>The Reason why <hi>Saturday-Evening</hi> and <hi>Lord's-Day-Morning</hi> were judged most convenient for the <hi>weekly</hi> Seasons, was, that these Times being so near the Time of dispensing <hi>Gospel-Ordinances</hi> thro' the christian World, which are the great Means, in the Use of which God is wont to grant his <hi>Spirit</hi> to Mankind, and the princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal Means that the Spirit of God makes use of to carry on his <hi>Work of Grace,</hi> it may well be supposed that the Minds of Christians in general will at these Seasons be especially disengaged from secular Affairs, and disposed to pious Meditations and the Duties of Devotion, and more naturally led to seek the Communications of the holy Spirit, and Success of the Means of Grace.—And as to the <hi>quarterly</hi> Times, it was thought helpful to Me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, that they should be on one or other of the <hi>first</hi> Days of each Quarter: <hi>Tuesday</hi> was prefer'd to <hi>Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>day,</hi> because in some Places People might have publick Prayers and Sermon on the stated Day, which might
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:005938_0025_0000000000000000"/>
not be so convenient on <hi>Monday,</hi> as on some Day at a greater Distance from the <hi>Sabbath.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was reckon'd a <hi>chief Use</hi> of such an Agreement and Method as this, That it would be a good Expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dient for the maintaining and keeping up, amongst the People of God, that great christian Duty of <hi>Prayerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness</hi> for the <hi>Coming of Christ's Kingdom,</hi> in general, which Christ has directed his Followers to be so much in, that it mayn't be out of Mind, and in a great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure sunk. Things, that we are too little inclined to, thro' Sloth, Carnality, or a Fulness of our own worldly and private Concerns, and that are to be attended at some Seasons or other, and have no special Seasons sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for them, are apt to be <hi>forgotten,</hi> or <hi>put off</hi> from Time to Time, and as it were adjourned <hi>without Day</hi>; and so, if not wholly neglected, yet too little attended. But when we fix certain Seasons, that we resolve, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less extraordinarily hindred, to devote to the Duty, it tends to prevent Forgetfulness, and a settled Negligence of it. Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ertain Returns of the Season will naturally refresh the Memory; will tend to put us in mind of the Precept of Christ, and the Obligations that lie on all his Followers, to abound in such a <hi>Duty,</hi> and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newedly engage us to the Consideration of the Impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance and Necessity and unspeakable Value of the <hi>Mercy</hi> sought; and so, by frequent Renovation, to keep alive the Consideration and Sense of these Things at <hi>all Times.</hi> —Thus the first Promoters of this <hi>Agreement</hi> judged, that it would be subservient to more abundant <hi>Prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness</hi> for Effusions of the Holy Spirit, <hi>at all Times</hi> thro' the <hi>Year,</hi> both in secret and social Worship; par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly as to this last, in Congregations, Families, and other praying Societies.—And then they also judged,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:005938_0026_0000000000000000"/>
that such an <hi>agreed Union</hi> would tend to <hi>animate</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage</hi> God's People in the Duty proposed; and that particular Persons and Societies, knowing that great Multitudes of their Fellow Christians, in so many dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant Places, were at the <hi>same Time</hi> (as a Token of the Union of their Hearts with them in this Affair) by Agreement engaged in the <hi>same holy Exercise,</hi> would naturally be <hi>enlivened</hi> in the Duty by such a Considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
            <p>It was not thought best, to propose at first a longer Time for the Continuance of <hi>this</hi> precise Method, than <hi>two Years</hi>: It being considered, that it is not possible, before any Trial, so well to judge of the <hi>Expedience</hi> of a particular <hi>Method</hi> and certain <hi>Cir<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>umstances</hi> of the managing and ordering such an Affair, as after some Time of Experience. And it was not known, but that after longer Consideration, and some Trial, it might be thought best to <hi>alter</hi> some Circumstances; or whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther others, that had not yet been consulted, might not propose a <hi>better</hi> Method. The Time <hi>first</hi> agreed on, tho' but short, was thought sufficient to give Opportu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity for Judgment and Experience, and for such as were disposed to Union in an Affair of such a Nature, in distant Places, mutually to communicate their Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>timents on the Subject.</p>
            <p>The <hi>Way,</hi> in which those that first projected and came into this Agreement, thought best for the giving <hi>Notice</hi> of it and proposing it to <hi>others,</hi> was not by any Thing published from the <hi>Press</hi>; but by <hi>personal Conversa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> with such as they could conveniently have immediate Access to, and by <hi>private Correspondence</hi> with others at a Distance. At first it was intended, that some <hi>formal Paper,</hi> proposing the Matter, should be sent about for
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:005938_0027_0000000000000000"/>
proper Amendments and Improvements, and then Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence: But on more mature Deliberation, it was consider'd how this might give a Handle to <hi>Objections</hi> (which they thought it best, to the utmost, to avoid in the <hi>Infancy</hi> of the Affair) and how practicable it was, without any such Formality, to spread the Substance of the Proposal by private <hi>Letters,</hi> together with a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest to their Correspondents, mutually to communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cate their Thoughts. Therefore this was fix'd on, as the Method that was preferable at the Beginning. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly, they proposed and endeavoured to promote the Affair in this Way; and with such Success, that great Numbers in <hi>Scotland</hi> and <hi>England</hi> fell in with the Proposal, and some in <hi>North-America.</hi> As to <hi>Scotland,</hi> it was complied with by Numbers in the four chief Towns, <hi>Edinburgh, Glasgow, Aberdeen,</hi> and <hi>Dundee,</hi> and many Country Towns and Congregations in various Parts of the Land: One of the Ministers, that was primarily concerned in this Affair, in a Letter to one of his Correspondents, speaks of an explicit Declaration of the Concurrence of the praying Societies in <hi>Edinburgh,</hi> which they had made in a Letter. The Number of the praying Societies in that City is very considerable: Mr. <hi>Robe</hi> of <hi>Kilsyth</hi> (in a Letter to Mr. <hi>Prince</hi> of <hi>Bos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton,</hi> dated <hi>Nov.</hi> 3. 1743.) says, There were then above <hi>thirty</hi> Societies of <hi>young</hi> People there newly erected, some of whom consisted of upwards of <hi>thirty</hi> Members. —As to <hi>Glasgow,</hi> this Union was unanimously agreed to by about <hi>forty five</hi> praying Societies there; as an eminent Minister in that City informs, in a Letter.</p>
            <p>The <hi>two Years,</hi> first agreed on, ended last <hi>November.</hi> A little before this Time expired, a Number of Mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters in <hi>Scotland</hi> agreed on a <hi>Memo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

and sent abroad to their Brethren in various Parts, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing to 'em and requesting of 'em to join with them in the Continuance of this Method of united Prayer, and in Endeavours to promote it. Copies of which Memorial have lately been sent over into <hi>New England,</hi> to the Number of near 500, directed to be distributed in almost every County in this Province of the <hi>Massa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chusetts-Bay,</hi> and also in several Parts of <hi>Connecticut, New-Hampshire, Rhode-Island, New-York, New-Iersey, Pensyl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vania, Maryland, Virginia, Carolina,</hi> and <hi>Georgia.</hi> The most (I suppose) of these were sent to one of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gregational Ministers in <hi>Boston,</hi> with a Letter subscribed by twelve Ministers in <hi>Scotland,</hi> about the Affair:— Many of them to another of the said Ministers of <hi>Boston</hi>; and some to a Minister in <hi>Connecticut.</hi>—It being short, I shall here insert a Copy of it at Length.

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg> Now proceed to the <hi>second</hi> Thing intended in this Discourse, <hi>viz.</hi> to offer to Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration some Things, which may tend to <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duce the People of God to comply with the Proposal</hi> and <hi>Request,</hi> made to them in the <hi>Memorial.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And I desire that the following Things may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sider'd.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is evident from the <hi>Scripture,</hi> that there is <hi>yet remaining</hi> a great <hi>Advancement</hi> of the Interest of <hi>Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion</hi> and the <hi>Kingdom of Christ</hi> in this World, by an <hi>abundant outpouring of the Spirit of God,</hi> far greater and more extensive than ever yet has been. 'Tis certain, that many Things, which are spoken concerning a <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious</hi> Time of the Church's <hi>Enlargement</hi> and <hi>Prosperity</hi> in the <hi>latter Days,</hi> have never yet been fulfill'd. There has never yet been any Propagation and Prevailing of Religion, in any wise, of that <hi>Extent</hi> and <hi>Universality,</hi> which the Prophecies represent. It is is often foretold
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:005938_0035_0000000000000000"/>
and signified, in a great Variety of strong Expressions, that there should a Time come, when <hi>all Nations,</hi> thro' the whole habitable World, should embrace the true Religion, and be brought into the Church of God. It was often promised to the Patriarchs, that <hi>in their Seed all the Nations,</hi> or (as it is sometimes expressed) <hi>all the Families of the Earth, should be blessed.</hi> (See <hi>Gen.</hi> xii.3. — xviii.18. — xxii.18. — xxvi.4. and xxviii.14.) Agreable to this, 'tis said of the <hi>Messiah,</hi> Psal. lxxii.11. That <hi>all Nations shall serve him</hi>; and in Ver. 17. <hi>Men shall be blessed in Him, and all Nations shall call him blessed.</hi> And in <hi>Isai.</hi> ii.2. it is said, that <hi>All Nations shall flow unto the Mountain of the House of the Lord.</hi> And, <hi>Ier.</hi> iii.17. That <hi>all Nations shall be gathered unto the Name of the Lord to</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>and shall walk no more after the Imagination of their evil Heart.</hi> So it is said, That <hi>all Flesh shall come and worship before the Lord,</hi> Isai. lxvi.23. And that <hi>all Flesh should see the Glory of God together,</hi> Isai. xl.5. And that <hi>all Flesh should come to him that hears Prayer,</hi> Psal. lxv.2. Christ compares the <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Heaven</hi> in this World <hi>to Leaven, which a Woman took and hid in three Measures of Meal, 'till the whole was leavened,</hi> Matth. xiii.33. It is natural and reasonable to suppose, that the whole World should finally be given to Christ, as one whose Right it is to reign, as the proper Heir of him, who is originally the King of all Nations, and the Possessor of Heaven and Earth: And the Scripture teaches us, that God the Father hath constituted his Son, as God-Man, and in his Kingdom of Grace, or mediatorial Kingdom, to be <hi>the Heir of the World,</hi> that he might in this Kingdom have <hi>the Heathen for his Inheritance, and the utmost Ends of the Earth for his Possession</hi>; Heb. i.2. and ii.8. Psal. ii.

6, 7, 8. Thus <hi>Abraham</hi> is said to be <hi>the Heir of the World,</hi> not in himself, but in <hi>his Seed,</hi> which is Christ; <hi>Rom.</hi> iv.13. And how was this to be fulfilled to <hi>Abraham,</hi> but by God's fulfilling that great Promise, that <hi>in his Seed all the Nations of the Earth should be blessed?</hi> For that Promise is what the Apostle is speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of: Which shews, that God has appointed Christ to be the Heir of the World in his Kingdom of Grace, and to possess and reign over all Nations, thro' the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pagation of his Gospel, and the Power of his Spirit communicating the Blessings of it. God hath appoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him to this universal Dominion by a most solemn Oath; Isai. xlv.23. <hi>I have sworn by my self, the Word is gone out of my Mouth in Righteousness, and shall not return, that unto me every Knee shall bow, every Tongue shall swear.</hi> Compar'd with <hi>Phil.</hi> ii.10, 11.—Tho' this solemn Oath of God the Father is to be understood in so comprehensive a Sense, as to extend to what shall be accomplished at the Day of Judgment, yet it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent by the foregoing and following Verses, that the Thing most directly intended, is what shall be f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>lfilled by the spreading of the Gospel of his Salvation, and Power of the Spirit of Grace, bringing <hi>all the Ends of the Earth to look to him that they may be saved,</hi> and come to him for <hi>Righteousness and Strength,</hi> that <hi>in him they might be justified, and might Glory.</hi> God has suffered many earthly Princes to extend their Conquests over a great Part of the Face of the Earth, and to possess a Dominion of vast Extent, and one Monarchy to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quer and succeed another, the latter being still the greater: 'Tis reasonable to suppose that a much greater Glory in this Respect should be reserved for Christ, God's own Son and rightful Heir, who has purchased
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:005938_0037_0000000000000000"/>
the Dominion by so great and hard a Service: 'Tis reasonable to suppose, that his Dominion should be far the largest, and his Conquests vastly the greatest and most extensive. And thus the Scriptures represent the Matter, in <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>'s Vision, and the Prophet's Interpretation, <hi>Dan.</hi> ii. There the four great Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>narchies of the Earth, one succeeding another, are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by <hi>the great Image of Gold, Silver, Brass, Iron and Clay</hi>; but at last <hi>a Stone, cut out of the Mountains without Hands, smites the Image upon his Feet, which breaks the Iron, Clay, Brass, Silver and Gold in Pieces, that all becomes as the Chaff of the Summer threshing Floors, and the Wind carries them away, that no Place is found for them; but the Stone waxes great, becomes a great Mountain, and</hi> FILLS THE WHOLE EARTH: Signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fying <hi>the Kingdom which the Lord God of Heaven should set up in the World, last of all, which should break in Pieces and consume all other Kingdoms.</hi> Surely this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presentation leads us to suppose, that this last Kingdom shall be of vastly greater Extent than any of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding. The like Representation is made in the viith Chapter of <hi>Daniel</hi>; there the four Monarchies are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by four great Beasts that arose successively, one conquering and subduing another; the fourth and last of these is said to be <hi>dreadful,</hi> and <hi>terrible,</hi> and <hi>strong exceedingly,</hi> and <hi>to have great Iron Teeth,</hi> and <hi>to devour and break in Pieces, and s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>amp the Residue with his Feet</hi>; yea it is said Ver. 23, that the Kingdom represented by this Beast shall <hi>devour the whole Earth</hi>; But last of all <hi>one like the Son of Man</hi> appears, <hi>coming to the ancient of Days, and being brought near before him, and receiving of him a Dominion, and Glory, and a Kingdom,</hi> THAT ALL PEOPLE, NATIONS AND LANGUAGES <hi>should
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:005938_0038_0000000000000000"/>
serve him.</hi> This last Circumstance, of the vast Extent and Universality of his Dominion, is manifestly spoken of as one Thing greatly distinguishing this holy King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom from all the preceeding Monarchies: Altho' of one of the Former it was said, that it should <hi>devour the whole Earth,</hi> yet we are naturally led, both by the much greater Emphasis and Strength of the Expressions, as well as by the whole Connection and Tenor of the Prophecy, to understand the Universality here expressed in a much more extensive and absolute Sense: And the Terms used in the Interpretation of this Vision are such, that scarcely any can be devised more strong, to signify an absolute Universality of Dominion over the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Face of the Earth; Ver. 27. <hi>And the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and Dominion, and the</hi> GREATNESS OF THE KINGDOM UNDER THE WHOLE HEAVEN, <hi>shall be given to the People of the most high God.</hi> Agreable to this, <hi>the Gospel</hi> is represented as <hi>preached unto them that dwell on the Earth, and to every Nation, and Tongue, and Kindred, and People</hi>; Rev. xiv.6. The Universality of the Prevalence of true Religion in the latter Days, is sometimes express'd by its reaching to <hi>the utmost Ends of the Earth</hi> (Psal. ii.8.) <hi>To all the Ends of the Earth, and of the World,</hi> (Psal. xxii.27.—lxvii.7.—xcviii.3. Isai. xlv.22.) <hi>All the Ends of the Earth, with those that are far off upon the Sea,</hi> (Psal. lxv.5.) <hi>From the rising of the Sun to the going down of the same,</hi> (Psal. cxiii.3. Mal. i.11.) <hi>The Outgoings of the Morning and of the Evening.</hi> (Psal. lxv.8.) It seems that all the most strong Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressions, that were in use among the <hi>Iews</hi> to sign<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="31" facs="unknown:005938_0039_0000000000000000"/>
Expressions are used, and there is an Accumulation of them, express'd with great Force.</p>
            <p>It would be unreasonable to say, These are only bold <hi>Figures,</hi> used after the Manner of the <hi>Eastern</hi> Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, to express the great Extent of the Christian Church, at and after the Days of <hi>Constantine</hi>: To say so, would be in Effect to say, that it would have been impossible for God, if he had desired it, plainly to have foretold any Thing that should absolutely have exten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded to all Nations of the Earth. I question whether it be possible to find out a more strong Expression, to sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify an absolute Universality of the Knowledge of the true Religion thro' the habitable Word, than that in Isai. xi.9. <hi>The Earth shall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord,</hi> AS THE WATERS COVER THE SEAS. Which i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> as much as to say, As there is no Place in the vast Ocean where there is not Water, so there shall be no Part of the World of Mankind where there is not the Knowledge of the Lord; as there is no Part of the wide Bed or Cavity possess'd by the Sea, but what is covered with Water, so there shall be no Part of the habitable World, that shall not be covered by the Light of the Gospel, and possess'd by the true Religion. <hi>Waters</hi> are often in Prophecy put for Nations and Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titud<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>s of People: So the Waters of the main Ocean seem sometimes to be put for the Inhabitants of the Earth in general; as in <hi>Ezekiel</hi>'s Vision of Waters of the Sanctuary (<hi>Ezek.</hi> xlvii.) which flowed from the Sanctuary, and ran East, 'till they came to the Ocean, and were at first a small Stream, but continually en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased 'till they became a great River; and when they came to the Sea, the Water even of the vast Ocean was <hi>healed</hi> (Ver. 8.) representing the Conversion of
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:005938_0040_0000000000000000"/>
the World to the true Religion in the latter Days.— It seems evident, that the Time will come, when there will not be one Nation remaining in the World, which shall not embrace the true Religion, in that God has expresly revealed, that no one such Nation shall be left standing on the Earth; Isai. lx.12. <hi>The Nation and Kingdom that will not serve Thee shall perish; yea, those Nations shall be utterly wasted.</hi>—God has declared that Heathen Idolatry and all the Worship of false gods shall be wholly abolished, in the most universal Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, so that it shall be continued in no Place under the Heavens, or upon the Face of the Earth; Jer. x.11. <hi>The gods that have not made the Heavens and the Earth, even they shall perish from the Earth, and from under these Heavens.</hi> Ver. 15. <hi>They are Vanity, and the Work of Errors, in the Time of their Visitation they shall perish.</hi> This must be understood as what shall be brought to pass while <hi>this Earth</hi> and <hi>these Heavens</hi> remain, i. e. before the End of the World. Agreable to this is that, Isai. liv.1, 2. <hi>Sing, O Barren, and thou that didst not bear;—for more are the Children of the desolate than the Children of the married Wife, saith the Lord: Enlarge the Place of thy Tent, and let them stretch forth the Curtains of thy Habitation; spare not; lengthen thy Cords, strengthen thy Stakes.</hi> Ver. 5. <hi>For thy Maker is thy Husband; the Lord of Hosts is his Name; and thy Redeemer the holy One of Israel</hi>; THE GOD OF THE WHOLE EARTH SHALL HE BE CALLED.</p>
            <p>The Prophecies of the <hi>New-Testament</hi> do no less evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently shew, that a Time will come when the Gospel shall universally prevail, and the Kingdom of Christ be extended over the whole habitable Earth, in the most proper Sense. Christ says, (John xii.32.) <hi>I, if I be

lifted up from the Earth, will draw all Men unto me.</hi> 'Tis fit, that when the Son of God becomes Man, he should have Dominion over all Mankind: 'Tis fit, that since he became an Inhabitant of the Earth, and shed his Blood on the Earth, he should possess the whole Earth: 'Tis fit, seeing here he became a Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant, and was subject to Men, and was arraigned be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore them, and judged, condemned and executed by them, and suffered Ignominy and Death in a most publick Manner, before <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> being <hi>lifted up</hi> to View on the Cross upon an Hill, near that populous City <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> at a most publick Time, when there were many hundred thousand Spectators, from all Parts, that he should be rewarded with an universal D<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Apostle, in the xith of <hi>Romans,</hi> teaches us to look to that great Out-pouring of the Spirit and In-gathering of Souls into Christ's Kingdom, that was in those Days, first of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and then of the <hi>Gentiles,</hi> to be but as the <hi>First-fruits</hi> of the intended Harvest, both with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> and to look on the In-gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of those First-fruits as a Sign that all the Remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der both of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles</hi> should in due Time be gathered in; Ver. 16. <hi>For if the</hi> First-fruit <hi>be holy,</hi> the Lump <hi>is also holy; and if the Root be holy, so are the Branches.</hi> And in that Context, the Apostle speaks of the FULNESS of both <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles,</hi> as what shall hereafter be brought in, as distinct from that In gather<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing from among both, that was in those primitive Ages of Christianity: In Ver. 12. we read of the <hi>Fulness of the Iews,</hi> and in the 25th of the <hi>Fulness of the Gentiles</hi>: And there in Ver. 30, 31, 32. the Apostle teaches us to look upon that Infidelity and Darkness, that first
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:005938_0042_0000000000000000"/>
prevailed over all Gentile Nations, before Christ came, and then over the <hi>Iews</hi> after Christ came, as what was wisely permitted of God, as a Preparation for the Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation of the Glory of God's Mercy, in due Time, on the whole World, constituted of <hi>Iews</hi> and <hi>Gentiles. God hath concluded them all in Unbelief, that he might have Mercy upon all.</hi> These Things plainly shew, that the Time is coming when the whole World of Mankind shall be brought into the Church of Christ; and not only a Part of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and a Part of the <hi>Gentile</hi> World, as the <hi>First-fruits,</hi> as it was in the first Ages of the Christian Church; but the <hi>Fulness</hi> of both, <hi>the whole Lump,</hi> all the Nation of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and all the World of <hi>Gentiles.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the last great Conflict between the Church of Christ and her Enemies, before the Commencement of the glorious Time of the Churches Peace and Rest, <hi>The Kings of the Earth, and the</hi> WHOLE WORLD, are represented as <hi>gathered together,</hi> Rev. xvi.14. and then the <hi>seventh Angel pours out his Vial into the Air,</hi> which limits that Kingdom that Satan has, as god of this World, in it's utmost Extent; — and that Kingdom is represented as utterly overthrown, Ver. 17, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And in another Description of that great Battle, Chap. xix, Christ is represented as riding forth, having on his Head <hi>many Crowns,</hi> and on his Vesture and on his Thigh a Name written, KING of KINGS AND LORD of LORDS. Which we may well suppose signifies, that he is now going to that Conquest, whereby he shall set up a Kingdom, in which he shall be <hi>King of Kings,</hi> in a far more extensive Manner than either the <hi>Babylonish, Persian, Grecian,</hi> or <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchs were. And in Ver. 17, and following, <hi>an Angel</hi> appears <hi>stan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:005938_0043_0000000000000000"/>
in the Sun,</hi> that overlooks the whole World, calling on <hi>all the Fowls that fly in the midst of Heaven, to come and eat the Flesh of Kings,</hi> &amp;c. And in Consequence of the great Victory Christ gains at that Time, <hi>an Angel comes down from Heaven, having the Key of the Bottomless Pit, and a great Chain in his Hand, and lays hold on the Devil, and binds him, and casts him into the Bottomless Pit, and shuts him up, and sets a Seal upon him, that he should deceive the Nations no more.</hi> Satan being dispossessed of that highest Monarchy on Earth, the <hi>Roman Empire,</hi> and cast out, in the Time of <hi>Constantine,</hi> is represented Chap. xii, by his being <hi>cast down from Heaven to the Earth</hi>: But now there is something far beyond that; he is cast <hi>out of the Earth,</hi> and is shut up in <hi>Hell,</hi> and confined to that alone, so that he has no Place left him in this World of Mankind, high nor low.</p>
            <p>Now will any be so unreasonable as to say, That all these Things don't signify more than that one <hi>third</hi> Part of the World should be brought into the Church of Christ; beyond which it can't be pretended that the Christian Religion has ever yet reached, in it's greatest Extent? Those Countries, which belonged to the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, that was brought to the Profession of Christianity, after the Reign of <hi>Constantine,</hi> are but a sm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <pb n="36" facs="unknown:005938_0044_0000000000000000"/>These Things make it very evident, that the <hi>main Fulfilment</hi> of those Prophecies, that speak of the glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Advancement of Christ's Kingdom on <hi>Earth,</hi> is still to come.</p>
            <p>And as there has been nothing as yet, with Regard to the Flourishing of Religion, and the Advancement of Christ's Kingdom, of such <hi>Extent</hi> as to answer the Prophecies, so neither has there been any Thing of that <hi>Duration,</hi> that is foretold. The Prophecies speak of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>'s being made <hi>the Ioy of the whole Earth,</hi> and also the <hi>Ioy of many Generations</hi> (Psal. xlviii.2. Isai. lx.15.) That <hi>God's People should long enjoy the Work of their Hands,</hi> (Isai. lxv.22.) That they should <hi>reign with Christ a thousand Years</hi> (Rev. xx.) by which we must at least understand a very long time. But it would be endless to mention all the Places, which signify that the Time of the Church's great Peace and Prosperity should be of long Continuance: Almost all the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies that speak of her latter-day-Glory, imply it; and it is implied in very many of them, that when once this Day of the Church's Advancement and Peace is begun, it shall never end, 'till the World ends; or, at least, that there shall be no more a Return of her Troubles and Adversity for any considerable Continuance; that then <hi>the Days of her Mourning shall be ended</hi>; that her Tribulations <hi>should then be as the Waters of</hi> Noah <hi>unto God, that as he has sworn that the Waters of</hi> Noah <hi>should no more pass over the Earth, so he will swear that he will no more be wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

withdraw it self</hi>; that <hi>the Light should not be clear and dark</hi> (i. e. there should be no more an Interchange of Light and Darkness, as used to be) but that it <hi>should be</hi> all <hi>one</hi> continued <hi>Day; not Day and Night</hi> (for so the Words are in the Original in Zech. xiv.7.) alternately, <hi>but it shall come to pass, that at Evening-Time</hi> (i. e. at the Time that Night and Darkness used to be) <hi>it shall be Light</hi>; and that <hi>the Nations should beat their Swords into Plow-shares, and their Spears into Pruning-hooks, and that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall not lift up Sword against Nation, nor learn War any more</hi>; but that there <hi>should be Abundance of Peace so long as the Moon endureth.</hi> And innumerable Things of this Nature are declared.</p>
            <p>But the Church of Christ has never yet enjoyed a State of Peace and Prosperity for any <hi>long</hi> Time; on the contrary, the Times of her Rest, and of the flourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing State of Religion, have ever been very <hi>short.</hi> Hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto the Church may say as in Isai. lxiii.17, 18. <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn, for thy Servants Sake, the Tribes of thine Inheritance; the People of thy Holiness have possessed it but a little while.</hi> The Quietness that the Church of God enjoyed after the Beginning of <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Reign, was very short; the Peace the Empire enjoy'd, in Freedom from War, was not more than twenty Years; no longer nor greater than it had enjoyed under some of the Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors. After this the Empire was rent in Pieces by intestine Wars, and wasted almost every where by the Invasions and Incursions of barbarous Nations, and the christian World was soon all in Contention and Confu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion, by Heresies and Divisions in Matters of Religion. And the Church of Christ has never as yet been for any long Time, free from Persecution; especially when Truth has prevailed, and true Religion flourished. 'Tis
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:005938_0046_0000000000000000"/>
manifest, that hitherto the People of God have been kept under, and <hi>Zion</hi> has been in a low afflicted State, and her Enemies have had the chief Sway.</p>
            <p>And another Thing, that makes it exceeding manifest that That Day of the Church's greatest Advancement on Earth, which is foretold in Scripture, has never yet come, is, that it is so plainly and expresly revealed that this Day should succeed the <hi>last</hi> of the four Monarchies, even the <hi>Roman,</hi> in its <hi>last</hi> State, wherein it <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>se Things are very plain in the iid and viith Chapters of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and also in the <hi>Revelation</hi> of <hi>St. Iohn.</hi> And it is also plain by the xith Chapter of <hi>Romans,</hi> that is shall be after the national Conversion of the <hi>Iews, which shall be as Life from the Dead to the Gentiles,</hi> and the <hi>Fulness of both Iews and Gentiles should be come in,</hi> and all the Nation of the <hi>Iews</hi> and all other Nations shall <hi>obtain Mercy,</hi> and there shall be that general Ingathering of the <hi>Harvest</hi> of the whole Earth, of which all that had been converted before, either o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            <p>And thus it is meet, that the <hi>last Kingdom</hi> which shall take Place on <hi>Earth,</hi> should be the Kingdom of God's own <hi>Son</hi> and <hi>Heir,</hi> whose Right it is to rule and reign; and that whatever Revolutions and Confusions there may be in the World, for a long Time, the Cause of Truth, the righteous Cause, should finally prevail, and God's holy People should at last <hi>inherit the Earth,</hi> and <hi>reign on Earth</hi>; and that the World should continue

The World is made for the Son of God; His Kingdom is the End of all Changes, that come to pass in the State of the World of Mankind; all are only to prepare the Way for this; 'tis fit therefore that the last Kingdom on Earth should be his. 'Tis wisely and mercifully or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered of God that it should be so, on this Account, as well as many others, <hi>viz.</hi> That the Church of God, under all preceeding Changes, should have this Conside<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration to encourage her, and maintain her Hope, and animate her Faith and Prayers, from Generation to Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration, that God has promised, her Cause should finally be maintained and prevail in this World.</p>

The Holy Spirit, in his Indwelling, his Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences and Fruits, is the Sum of all Grace, Holiness, Comfort and Joy, or in one Word, of all the spiritual Good Christ <hi>purchased</hi> for Men in <hi>this World</hi>: And is also the Sum of all Perfection, Glory and eternal Joy, that he purchased for them in <hi>another World.</hi> The Holy Spirit is that great Benefit, that is the Subject-Matter of the <hi>Promises,</hi> both of the eternal Covenant of Redemption, and also of the Covenant of Grace; the grand Subject of the Promises of the old Testament, in the Prophecies of the Blessings of the <hi>Messiah</hi>'s King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom; and the chief Subject of the Promises of the new Testament; and particularly of the Covenant of Grace delivered by Jesus Christ to his Disciples, as his <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

(Luke xxiv.49. Acts i.4. and ii.33, 39. Gal. iii.14. Eph. i.13. and iii.6.) This being the great Blessing Christ purchased by his Labours and Suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferings on Earth, it was the Blessing he <hi>received of the Father,</hi> when he ascended into Heaven, and entered into the Holy of Holies with his own Blood, to commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicate to those that he had redeemed. John xvi.7. <hi>It is expedient for you, that I go away; for if I go not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way, the Comforter will not come; but if I depart, I will send him unto you.</hi> Acts ii.33. <hi>Being by the right Hand of God exalted, and having received of the Father the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mise of the Holy Ghost, he hath shed forth this which 'ye n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Ascension. This is the Sum of the Benefits Christ ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains for Men by his <hi>Intercession</hi>; John xiv.16, 17. <hi>I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forter, that he may abide with you forever; even the Spirit of Truth.</hi> Herein consists Christ's communicative <hi>Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness,</hi> even in his being full of the <hi>Spirit,</hi> and so <hi>full of Grace and Truth,</hi> that we might of <hi>this Fulness receive, and Grace for Grace.</hi> He is <hi>anointed with the Holy Ghost</hi>; and this is <hi>the Ointment that goes down from the Head</hi> to the Members. <hi>God gives the Spirit not by Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure unto him,</hi> that every one that is his <hi>might receive according to the Measure of the Gift of Christ.</hi> This therefore was the great Blessing he prayed for in that wonderful <hi>Prayer,</hi> that he uttered for his Disciples and all his future Church, the Evening before he died, <hi>Iohn</hi> xvii: The Blessing he prayed for to the Father, in be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>half of his Disciples, was the same he had insisted on in his preceeding Discourse with them: And this doubtless was the Blessing that he prayed for, when as our High Priest, he <hi>offered up strong Crying and Tears,</hi> with his Blood, Heb. v.6, 7. The same that he shed his Blood for, he also shed Tears for, and poured out Prayers for.</p>
            <p>But the Time that we have been speaking of, is the <hi>chief</hi> Time of the Bestowment of this Blessing; the <hi>main Season</hi> of the Success of all that Christ did and suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Work of our Redemption. Before this the Spirit of God is given but very sparingly, and but few are saved; but then it will be far otherwise; Wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edness shall be rare then, as Vertue and Piety had been before: And undoubtedly, by far the greatest Number of them that ever receive the Benefits of Christ's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption,
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:005938_0055_0000000000000000"/>
from the Beginning of the World to the End of it, will receive it in that Time. The Number of the Inhabitants of the Earth will doubtless then be vast<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly multiplied; and the Number of redeemed Ones much more.—If we should suppose that glorious Day to last no more than (literally) a <hi>thousand Years,</hi> and that at the Beginning of that thousand Years the World of Mankind should be but just as numerous as it is now, and that the Number should be <hi>doubled,</hi> during that Time of great Health and Peace and the universal Blessing of Heaven, <hi>once</hi> only in an <hi>hundred</hi> Years, the Number at the End of the thousand Years would be more than a <hi>thousand</hi> Times greater than it is now; and if it should be doubled once in <hi>fifty</hi> Years (which probably the Number of the Inhabitants of <hi>New England</hi> has ordinarily been, in about <hi>half</hi> that Time) then at the End of the thousand Years, there would be more than a <hi>Million</hi> Inhabitants on the Face of the Earth, where there is <hi>one</hi> now. And there is Reason to think that thro' the greater Part of this Period, at least, the Number of <hi>Saints</hi> will, in their Increase, bear a Proportion to the Increase of the Number of Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants. And it must be consider'd, that if the Number of Mankind at the Beginning of this Period be no more than equal to the present Number, yet we may doubt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less conclude, that the Number of true Saints will be immensely greater; when instead of the <hi>few</hi> true and thoro' Christians now in some few Countries, every <hi>Nation</hi> on the Face of the whole Earth shall be conver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to Christianity, and every Country shall be full of true Christians; so that the successive Multiplication of true Saints thro' the <hi>thousand Years,</hi> will begin with that vast Advantage, beyond the Multiplication of
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:005938_0056_0000000000000000"/>
Mankind; where the latter is begun from <hi>Units,</hi> the other doubtless will begin with <hi>Hundreds,</hi> if not <hi>Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sands.</hi> How much greater then will be the Number of true Converts, that will be brought to a Participation of the Benefits of Christ's Redemption, during that Period, than in all other Times put together? I think, the fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>going Things consider'd, we shall be very moderate in our Conjectures, if we say, it is probable that there will be an <hi>hundred thousand</hi> Times more, that will actually be redeemed to God by Christ's Blood, during that Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riod of the Church's Prosperity that we have been speak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of, than ever had been before, from the Beginning of the World to that Time.</p>
            <p>That Time is represented in Scripture, as the <hi>proper appointed</hi> Season of Christ's <hi>Salvation</hi>; eminently the elect Season, <hi>the accepted Time,</hi> and <hi>Day of Salvation</hi> (Isai. xlix.8, and so on to Ver. 23<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and Chap. lxi.2. taken with the Context, in that and the preceeding and following Chapters) <hi>The Year of Christ's Redeemed,</hi> Isai. lxiii.4.—This Period is spoken of as the proper Time of the <hi>Dominion</hi> of the Redeemer, and Reign of his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deeming Love, in the iid and viith Chapters of <hi>Daniel,</hi> and many other Places; the proper Time of his <hi>Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest,</hi> or Ingathering of his Fruits from this fallen World; the appointed Day of his Triumph over <hi>Satan,</hi> the great Destroyer; and the appointed Day of his <hi>Marriage</hi> with his elect Spouse; (<hi>Rev.</hi> xix.7.) The Time given to the <hi>Sun of Righteousness</hi> to rule, as the Day is the Time God has appointed for the natural Sun to bear rule. There<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the bringing on of this Time is called <hi>Christ's coming in his Kingdom</hi>; wherein <hi>he will rent the Heavens and come down,</hi> and <hi>the Sun of Righteousness shall arise.</hi> (Mal. iv.2. and Isai. lx.1.</p>

               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:005938_0057_0000000000000000"/>The comparatively <hi>little</hi> saving Good there is in the World, as the Fruit of Christ's Redemption, before that Time, is as it were granted by Way of <hi>Anticipa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>; as we anticipate something of the Sun's Light by Reflection before the <hi>Day-Time,</hi> the proper Time of the Sun's Rule; and as the first Fruits are gathered be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the <hi>Harvest. Then</hi> more especially will be the Ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filment of those great Promises, made by God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to the Son, for his pouring out his Soul unto Death, Isai. liii.10, 11, 12; then <hi>shall he see his Seed, and the Pleasure of the Lord shall prosper in his Hand</hi>; then <hi>shall he see of the Travail of his Soul, and be satisfied, and shall justify many by his Knowledge</hi>; then <hi>will God divide him a Portion with the Great, and he shall divide the Spoil with the Strong</hi>; then shall Christ in an eminent Manner ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain his chosen Spouse, that <hi>he loved and died for, that he might sanctify and cleanse her, with the Washing of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, by the Word, and present her to himself, a glorious Church.</hi> He will obtain the <hi>Ioy that was set before him, for which he endured the Cross, and despised the Shame,</hi> chiefly in the Events and Consequences of that Day: That Day, as was observed before, is often represented as eminently the Time of the <hi>Rejoicing of the Bridegroom.</hi> The Fore-knowledge and Consideration of it was what supported him, and that which his Soul exulted in, at a Time when his Soul had been troubled at the View of his approaching Sufferings; as may be seen in <hi>Iohn</hi> xii.23, 24, 27, 31, 32.</p>
            <p>Now therefore, if it be so, that This is what <hi>Iesus Christ,</hi> our great Redeemer and the Head of the Church, did so much desire, and set his Heart upon, from all Eternity, and which he did and suffered so much for, offering up <hi>strong Crying and Tears,</hi> and <hi>his precious Blood,</hi>
               <pb n="50" facs="unknown:005938_0058_0000000000000000"/>
to obtain it; surely his Disciples and Members should also earnestly seek it, and be much and earnest in Prayer for it.</p>
            <p>Let it be considered,</p>
            <p n="4">4. The <hi>whole Creation is,</hi> as it were, <hi>earnestly waiting</hi> for that Day, and constantly <hi>groaning and travailing in Pain</hi> to bring forth the Felicity and Glory of it. For that Day is above all other Times, excepting the Day of Judgment, the Day of <hi>the Manifestation of the Sons of God,</hi> and of their <hi>glorious Liberty</hi>: And therefore that elegant Representation the Apostle makes of the earnest Expectation and Travail of the Creation, in <hi>Rom.</hi> viii.19,—22. is applicable to the glorious Events of this Day; <hi>The earnest Expectation of the Creature waiteth for the Manifestation of the Sons of God. For the Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture was made subject to Vanity, not willingly, but by Reason of him who hath subjected the same in Hope. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause the Creature itself also shall be delivered from the Bondage of Corruption into the glorious Liberty of the Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of God. For we know that the whole Creation groan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eth and travaileth in Pain together until now.</hi> This visi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble World has now for many Ages been subjected to <hi>Sin,</hi> and made as it were a Servant to it, thro' the abusive Improvement that Man, who has the Dominion over the Creatures, put<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> the Creatures to. Thus the Sun is a Sort of Servant to all Manner of Wickedness, as it's Light and other beneficial Influences are abused by Men, and made subservient to their Lusts and sinful Purposes. So of the Rain, and Fruits of the Earth, and the Brute-Animals, and all other Parts of the visible Creation; they all serve Men's Corruption, and obey their sinful Will; and God doth in a Sort subject them
<pb n="51" facs="unknown:005938_0059_0000000000000000"/>
to it; for he continues his Influence and Power to make them to be obedient, according to the same Law of Nature whereby they yield to Men's Command when used to good Purposes. 'Tis by the immediate Influence of God upon Things, acting upon them, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to those constant Methods that we call the Laws of Nature, that they are ever obedient to Man's Will, or that we can use 'em at all. This Influence God continues, to make them obedient to Men's Will, tho' wicked. Which is a sure Sign that the present State of Things is not lasting: It is Confusion; and God would not suffer it to be, but that he designs in a little Time to put an End to it, when it shall no more be so. Seeing it is to be but a little while, God chooses rather to subject the Creature to Man's Wickedness, than to disturb and interrupt the Course of Nature ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to it's stated Laws: But 'tis, as it were, a Force upon the Creature; for the Creature is abused in it, perverted to far meaner Purposes than those for which the Author of it's Nature made it, and to which he adapted it. The Creature therefore is as it were unwillingly subject; and would not be subject, but that it is but for a short Time; and it, as it were, hopes for an Alteration. 'Tis a Bondage the Creature is subject to, from which it was partly delivered when Christ came, and the Gospel was promulgated in the World; and will be more fully delivered at the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the glorious Day we are speaking of; and perfectly at the Day of Judgment.—This agrees with the Context; for the Apostle was speaking of the present suffering State of the Church. The Reason why the Church in this World is in a suffering State, is that the World is subjected to the Sin and Corruption
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:005938_0060_0000000000000000"/>
of Mankind. By <hi>Vanity,</hi> in Scripture, is very common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly meant Sin and Wickedness<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and also by <hi>Corruption,</hi> as might be shewn in very many Places, would my in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Brevity allow.</p>
            <p>Tho' the Creature is thus subject to Vanity, yet it don't rest in this Subjection, but is constantly acting and exerting itself, in order to that glorious Liberty that God has appointed at the Time we are speaking of, and as it were reaching forth towards it. All the Changes that are brought to pass in the World, from Age to Age, are ordered in infinite Wisdom in one Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spect or other to prepare the Way for that glorious Issue of Things, that shall be when Truth and Righteousness shall finally prevail, and he, whose Right it is, shall take the Kingdom. All the Creatures, in all their Operations and Motions, continually tend to this. As in a Clock, all the Motions of the whole System of Wheels and Movements, tend to the striking of the Hammer at the appointed Time. All the Revolutions and restless Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Sun and other heavenly Bodies, from Day to Day, from Year to Year, and from Age to Age, are continually tending hither; as all the many Turnings of the Wheels of a Chariot, in a Journey, tend to the appointed Journey's End. The mighty Struggles and Conflicts of Nations, and Shakings of Kingdoms, and those vast successive Changes that are bro't to pass, in the Kingdoms and Empires of the World, from one Age to another, are as it were Travail-Pangs of the Creation, in order to bring forth this glorious Event. And the Scriptures represent the last Struggles and Changes that shall immediately preceed this Event, as being the greatest of all; as the last Pangs of a Woman in travail are the most violent.</p>

               <pb n="53" facs="unknown:005938_0061_0000000000000000"/>The Creature thus earnestly expecting this glorious Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifestation and Liberty of the Children of God, and tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing in Pain in order to it, therefore the Scriptures, by a like Figure, do very often represent, that when this shall be accomplished, the whole inanimate Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion shall greatly rejoice: That <hi>the Heavens shall sing, The Earth be glad, The Mountains break forth into Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, The Hills be joyful together, The Trees clap their Hands, The lower Parts of the Earth shout, The Sea roar and the Fulness thereof, and the Floods clap their Hands,</hi> Isai. xliv.23.—xlix.13.

            <p>All the intelligent elect Creation, all God's holy Creatures in Heaven and Earth, are truly and properly waiting for, and earnestly expecting that Event. 'Tis abundantly represented in Scripture as the Spirit and Character of all true Saints, that they set their Hearts upon, love, long, wait and pray for the promised Glory of that Day; they are spoken of as those that <hi>prefer</hi> Jerusalem <hi>to their chief Ioy,</hi> (Psal. cxxxvii.6.) <hi>That take Pleasure in the Stones of</hi> Zion, <hi>and favour the Dust thereof</hi> (Psal. cii.13, 14.) <hi>That wait for the Consola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of</hi> Israel, (Luke ii.25. and Ver. 38.) 'Tis the Language of the Church of God, and the Breathing of the Soul of every true Saint, that we have in Psal. xiv.7. <hi>O that the Salvation of</hi> Israel <hi>were come out of</hi> Zion! <hi>when the Lord bringeth back the Captivity of his People,</hi> Jacob <hi>shall rejoice,</hi> and Israel <hi>shall be glad.</hi> and Cant. ii.17. <hi>Until the Day break, and the Shadows flee away, turn my Beloved, and be thou like a Roe, or a young Hart upon the Mountains of</hi> Bether.

            <p>The glorious Inhabitants of the heavenly World, the Saints and Angels there, that rejoice when one Sinner repents, are earnestly waiting, in an assured and joyful Dependance on God's Promises of that Conversion of the World, and Marriage of the Lamb, which shall be when that glorious Day comes; and therefore they are represented as all with one Accord rejoicing and praising God with such mighty Exultation and Triumph, when it is accomplished, in <hi>Rev.</hi> xix.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The Word of God is full of <hi>Precepts, Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments,</hi> and <hi>Examples,</hi> tending to excite and induce the People of God to be much in <hi>Prayer</hi> for this Mercy.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of God is the Chief of the Blessings, that are the Subject-Matter of christian Prayer; for it is the Sum of all spiritual Blessings; which are those that we need infinitely more than all others, and are those wherein our true and eternal Happiness consists. That which is the Sum of the Blessings that Christ purcha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed, is the Sum of the Blessings that Christians have to pray for; but that, as was observed before, is the Holy Spirit: And therefore when the Disciples came to Christ, and desired him to teach them to pray, <hi>Luke</hi> xi.
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:005938_0063_0000000000000000"/>
and he accordingly gave them particular Directions for the Performance of this Duty. The Conclusion of his whole Discourse, in the 13th Verse, plainly shews that the Holy Spirit is the Sum of the Blessings that are the Subject Matter of that Prayer about which he had in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structed them. <hi>If ye then being evil, know how to give good Gifts unto your Children, how much more shall your hoavenly Father give the Holy Spirit to them that ask him?</hi> From which Words of Christ, we may also observe, that there is no Blessing that we have so great Encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragement to pray for, as the Spirit of God; the Words imply that our heavenly Father is especially ready to bestow his Holy Spirit on them that ask him. Of the more excellent Nature any Benefit is that we stand in Need of, the more ready God is to bestow it in answer to Prayer: The infinite Goodness of God's Nature is the more gratified, and the grand Design and Aim of the Contrivance and Work of our Redemption is the more answered, and Jesus Christ the Redeemer has the greater Success in his Undertaking and Labours; and those Desires that are expressed in Prayer for the most excellent Blessings are the most excellent Desires, and consequently such as God most approves of, and is most ready to gratify.</p>
            <p>The Scriptures don't only direct and encourage us in general to pray for the Holy Spirit above all Things else, but it is the expresly revealed Will of God, that his Church should be very much in Prayer for that glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Out-pouring of the Spirit that is to be in the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Days, and the Things that shall be accomplished by it. God speaking of that blessed Event, <hi>Ezek.</hi> xxxvi. under the Figure of <hi>cleansing the House of</hi> Israel <hi>from all their Iniquities, planting and building their waste

and ruined Places, and making them to become like the Gar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den of</hi> Eden, <hi>and filling them with Men like a Flock, like the holy Flock, the Flock of</hi> Jerusalem <hi>in her solemn Feasts</hi> (wherein he doubtless has Respect to the same glorious Restoration and Advancement of his Church that is spoken of in the next Chapter, and in all the following Chapters to the End of the Book) he says, Ver. 37. <hi>Thus saith the Lord, I will yet for this be enquired of by the House of</hi> Israel, <hi>to do it for them.</hi> Which doubtless im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, that it is the Will of God that extraordinary Prayer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness in his People for this Mercy should precede the Bestowment of it.</p>
            <p>I know of no Place in the Bible, where so strong an Expression is made use of to signify Importunity in Prayer, as is used in <hi>Isai.</hi> lxii.6, 7. where the People of God are called upon to be importunate for this Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy: <hi>Ye that make mention of the Lord, keep not Silence, and give him no Rest, 'till he establish, and 'till he make</hi> Jeru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>salem <hi>a Praise in the Earth.</hi> How strong is the Phrase! And how loud is this Call to the Church of God, to be fervent and incessant in their Cries to him for this great Mercy! How wonderful are the Words to be used, concerning the Manner in which such Worms of the Dust should address the high and lofty One that inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bits Eternity! And what Encouragement is here, to approach the Mercy-Seat with the greatest Freedom, Boldness, Earnestness, Constancy and full Assurance of Faith, to seek of God this greatest Thing that can be sought in christian Prayer!</p>
            <p>'Tis a just Observation of a certain eminent Minister of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> in a Discourse of his lately published on <hi>Social Prayer,</hi> in which, speaking of Plead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for the Success of the Gospel, as required by the

               <hi>Lord's Prayer,</hi> he says,
<q>That notwithstanding of its being so compendious, yet the one Half of it, that is, three Petitions in six, and these the first prescribed, do all relate to this great Case:—So that to put up any one of these Petitions apart, or all of them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, is upon the Matter, to pray that the Dispensa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Gospel may be bless'd with divine Power.</q>
That glorious Day we are speaking of is the proper and appointed Time, above all others, for the bringing to pass the Things requested in each of these Petitions: As the Prophecies every where represent that as the Time, which God has especially appointed for the hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing or glorifying his own great Name in this World, causing <hi>his Glory to be revealed, that all Flesh may see it together,</hi> causing it <hi>openly to be manifested in the Sight of the Heathen,</hi> filling the whole World with the Light of his Glory to such a Degree that <hi>the Moon shall be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded and Sun ashamed</hi> before that brighter Glory: The appointed Time for the glorifying and magnifying the Name of Jesus Christ, causing <hi>every Knee to bow, and every Tongue to confess to him.</hi> This is the proper Time of <hi>God's Kingdom's coming,</hi> or of <hi>Christ's coming in his Kingdom</hi>: That is the very Time foretold in the iid of <hi>Daniel,</hi> when the <hi>Lord God of Heaven shall set up a King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom,</hi> in the latter Times of the last Monarchy, when it is divided into ten Kingdoms: And that is the very Time foretold in the viith of <hi>Daniel,</hi> when there should be <hi>given to One like to the Son of Man, Dominion, Glory and a Kingdom, that all People, Nations and Languages should serve him; and the Kingdom and Dominion, and the Greatness of the Kingdom under the whole Heaven shall be given to the People of the Saints of the most high God,</hi> after the Destruction of the <hi>little Horn,</hi> that should continue

               <hi>for a Time, Times, and the dividing of Time.</hi> And that is the Time wherein <hi>God's Will shall be done on Earth, as 'tis done in Heaven</hi>; when <hi>Heaven</hi> shall as it were be <hi>bowed,</hi> and <hi>come down</hi> to the Earth, as <hi>God's People shall be all Righteous,</hi> and <hi>Holiness to the Lord shall be written on the Bells of the Horses,</hi> &amp;c. So that the three first Petitions of the Lord's Prayer are in Effect no other than Requests for the bringing on this glorious Day.— And as the Lord's Prayer begins with asking for this, in the three first Petitions, so it concludes with it, in these Words, <hi>For thine is the Kingdom, and the Power, and the Glory for ever. Amen.</hi> Which Words imply a Request that God would take to himself his great Power, and reign, and manifest his Power and Glory in the World. Thus Christ teaches us that it becomes his Disciples to seek this above all other Things, and make it the first and the last in their Prayers, and that every Petition should be put up in a Subordination to the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of God's Kingdom and Glory in the World.</p>
            <p>Besides what has been observed of the Lord's Prayer, if we look thro' the whole Bible, and observe all the <hi>Examples</hi> of Prayer that we find there recorded, we shall find so many Prayers for no other Mercy, as for the Deliverance, Restoration and Prosperity of the <hi>Church,</hi> and the Advancement of <hi>God's Glory</hi> and <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Grace</hi> in the World. If we well consider the Prayers that we find recorded in the Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> I believe we shall see Reason to think, that a very great, if not the greater Part of them, are Prayers uttered, either in the Name of <hi>Christ,</hi> or in the Name of the <hi>Church,</hi> for such a Mercy: And undoubtedly the greatest Part of that Book of <hi>Psalms,</hi> is made up of Prayers for this Mercy, Prophecies of it, and prophetical Praises for it.</p>

            <p>The Scriptures give us great Reason to think, that when once there comes to appear much of a <hi>Spirit of Prayer</hi> in the Church of God for this Mercy, then it will soon be accomplished. 'Tis evidently with Refe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence to this Mercy, that God makes that Promise, Isai. xli.17, 18, 19. <hi>When the Poor and Needy seek Water, and there is none, and their Tongue faileth for Thirst, I the Lord will hear them; I, the God of</hi> Israel, <hi>will not forsake them; I will open Rivers in high Places,

and Fountains in the midst of the Valleys; I will make the Wilderness a Pool of Water, and the dry Land Springs of Water; I will plant in the Wilderness the Cedar, the Shit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tah-Tree, and the Myrtle and the Oil-Tree, I will set in the Desart the Fir-Tree, and the Pine, and the Box-Tree together.</hi> Spiritual <hi>Waters</hi> and <hi>Rivers</hi> are explained by the Apostle <hi>Iohn,</hi> to be the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> (Joh. vii.37, 38, 39.) It is now a Time of Scarcity of these spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Waters; there are as it were <hi>none</hi>: If God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, in this Time of great Drought, were but made duly sensible of this Calamity, and their own Emptiness and Necessity, and brought earnestly to <hi>thirst</hi> and <hi>cry</hi> for needed Supplies, God would doubtless soon fulfil this blessed Promise. We have another Promise much like this, in Psal. cii.16, 17. <hi>When the Lord shall build up</hi> Zion, <hi>he shall appear in his Glory; he will regard the Prayer of the Destitute, and not despise their Prayer.</hi> And remarkable are the Words that follow in the next Verse, <hi>This shall be written for the Generation to come; and the People which shall be created, shall praise the Lord.</hi> Which seems to signify, that this Promise should be left on Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord to encourage some <hi>future Generation</hi> of God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to pray and cry earnestly for this Mercy, to whom he would <hi>fulfill</hi> the Promise, and thereby give them, and great Multitudes of others, that should be converted through their Prayers, Occasion to <hi>praise</hi> his Name. Who knows but that the Generation here spoken of may be this <hi>present</hi> Generation? <hi>One</hi> Thing mentioned in the Character of that future Generation, is certainly true concerning the present, <hi>viz.</hi> That it is <hi>destitute</hi>; the Church of God is in very low, sorrowful and needy Circumstances: And if the <hi>next</hi> Thing there supposed, were also verified in us, <hi>viz.</hi> That we were made <hi>sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible</hi>

of our great Calamity, and brought to <hi>cry earnestly</hi> to God for Help, I am perswaded the <hi>third</hi> would be also verified, <hi>viz.</hi> That our <hi>Prayers</hi> would be turned into joyful <hi>Praises,</hi> for God's gracious Answers of our Prayers. It is spoken of as a Sign and Evidence, that <hi>the Time to favour</hi> Zion <hi>is come,</hi> when God's <hi>Servants</hi> are brought by their Prayerfulness for her Restoration, in an eminent Manner, to shew that <hi>they favour her Stones and Dust</hi>; in the 13th and 14th Verses of this Psalm, <hi>Thou shalt arise, and have Mercy upon</hi> Zion; <hi>for the Time to favour her, yea the set Time is come; For thy Servants take Pleasure in her Stones, and favour the Dust thereof.</hi>

And the four and twenty Elders, which sat before God on their Seats, fell upon their Faces, and worshipped God, saying, We give thee Thanks, O Lord God Almighty, which art and wast and art to come, because thou hast taken to thee thy great Power, and hast reigned.</hi> Since it is thus, that it is the Pleasure of God so to honour his People, as to carry on all the Designs of his Kingdom in this Way, <hi>viz.</hi> By the Prayers of his Saints, This gives us great Reason to think, that whenever the Time comes that God gives an extraordinary Spirit of Prayer for the promised Advancement of his Kingdom on Earth, (which is God's great Aim in all preceeding Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dences, and which is the main Thing that the Spirit of Prayer in the Saints aims at) then the fulfilling this Event is nigh.</p>

Instruments of pulling down the Kingdom of <hi>Satan,</hi> by Prayer.</p>
            <p>The Spirit of God was poured out upon <hi>Christ</hi> him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self, in Answer to Prayer; Luke iii.21, 22. <hi>Now when all the People were baptized, it came to pass, that Iesus also being baptized, and praying, the Heaven was opened, and the Holy Ghost descended in a bodily Shape like a Dove, upon him; and a Voice came from Heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son, in Thee I am well pleased.</hi> The Spirit descends on the Church of Christ, the same Way, in this Respect, that it descended on the Head of the Church. The greatest Effusion of the Spirit that ever yet has been, even that which was in the primitive Times of the christian Church, which began in <hi>Ierusalem</hi> on the Day of <hi>Pentecost,</hi> was in answer to extraordinary Prayer. When the Disciples were gathered together to their Lord, a little before his Ascension, <hi>he commanded them that they should not depart from</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>but wait for the Promise of the Father, which</hi> (saith he) <hi>ye have heard of me,</hi> i. e. the Promise of the Holy Ghost; <hi>Acts</hi> i.4. What they had their Hearts upon was the <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storation of the Kingdom to</hi> Israel: <hi>Lord,</hi> (say they) <hi>wilt thou, at this Time, restore again the Kingdom to</hi> Israel, Ver. 6. And according to Christ's Direction after his Ascension, they returned to <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and continued in united fervent Prayer and Supplication. It seems they spent their Time in it from Day to Day, without ceasing; 'till the Spirit came down in a wonderful Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner upon them, and that Work was begun which never ceased, 'till the World was turned up-side down, and all the chief Nations of it were converted to Christianity. And that glorious Deliverance and Advancement of the christian Church, that was in the Days of <hi>Constantine
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:005938_0076_0000000000000000"/>
the Great,</hi> followed the extraordinary Cries of the Church to God, as the Matter is represented in <hi>Rev.</hi> vi. at the opening of the fifth Seal. The Church in her suffering State is represented crying with a loud Voice, <hi>How long, Lord, holy and true, dost thou not judge, and avenge our Blood on them that dwell on the Earth?</hi> And the opening of the next Seal brings on that mighty Revolution, in the Days of <hi>Constantine,</hi> compared to those great Changes that shall be at the End of the World.</p>
            <p>As there is so great and manifold Reason from the Word of God, to think that if a Spirit of earnest Prayer for that great Effusion of the Spirit of God which I am speaking of, prevailed in the christian Church, the Mercy would be soon granted; so those that are engaged in such Prayer might expect the first Benefit. God will come to those that are seeking him and waiting for him; <hi>Isai.</hi> xxv.9. and xxvi.8. When Christ came in the Flesh, he was first revealed to them who were <hi>waiting for the Consolation of</hi> Israel, and <hi>looking for Redemption in</hi> Jerusalem, Luke i.25, 38. And in that great Out-pouring of the Spirit that was in the Days of the Apostles, which was attended with such glorious Effects among Jews and Gentiles, the Spirit came down first on those that were engaged in united earnest Prayer for it.— A special Blessing is promised to them that love and pray for the Prosperity of the Church of God, Psal. cxxii.6. <hi>Pray for the Peace of</hi> Jerusalem. <hi>They shall prosper, that love thee.</hi>

The great outward Cala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mities, in which the World is involved; and particularly the bloody War that embroils and wastes the Nations of Christendom, and in which our Nation has so great a Share, may well make all that believe God's Word, and love Mankind, earnestly long and pray for that Day, when the Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb, and the Nations shall beat their Swords into Plow-shares, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> But especially do the spiritual Calamities and Miseries of the present Time, shew our great Need of that blessed Effusion of God's Spirit: There having been, for so long a Time, so great a Witholding of the Spirit, from the greater Part of the christian World, and such dismal Consequences of it, in the great Decay of vital Piety, and the exceeding Prevalence of Infidelity, Heresy and all Manner of Vice and Wickedness; and especially in our Land and Nation; of which a most affecting Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count has lately been published in a Pamphlet printed in <hi>London,</hi> and re-printed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> entitled <hi>Britain</hi>'s <hi>Remembrancer</hi>; by which it seems that Luxury, and Wickedness of almost every Kind, is well nigh come to the utmost Extremity in the Nation; and if Vice should continue to prevail and encrease for one Generation more, as it has the Generation past, it looks as tho' the Nation could hardly continue in Being, but must sink under the Weight of it's own Corruption and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nes<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And how lamenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble is the moral and religious State of these <hi>American</hi> Colonies? Of <hi>New-England</hi> in particular? How much is that Kind of Religion, that was professed and much experienced and practised, in the <hi>first,</hi> and apparently the <hi>best</hi> Times of <hi>New-England,</hi> grown and growing out of Credit? What fierce and violent Contentions have been of late among Ministers and People, about Things of a religious Nature? How much is the Gos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel-Ministry grown into Contempt? and the Work of the Ministry, in many Respects, laid under uncommon Difficulties, and even in Danger of sinking amongst us? How many of our Congregations and Churches rending in Pieces? Church Discipline weakened, and Ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nances less and less regarded? What wild and extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gant Notions, gross Delusions of the Devil, and strange Practices have prevailed, and do still prevail, in many Places, under a Pretext of extraordinary Purity, Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuality, Liberty, and Zeal against Formality, Usurpa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Conformity to the World? How strong and deeply rooted and general are the Prejudices that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail against vital Religion and the Power of Godliness, and almost every Thing that appertains to it or tends to it?

            <p>As there is much in the present State of Things to shew us our great Need of this Mercy, and to cause us to desire it; so there is very much to convince us, that <hi>God alone can bestow it,</hi> and shew us our entire and ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solute Dependance on him for it.

               </gap>nkind, from such Miseries as have been mention'd, does now remarkably appear. Those Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servations of the Apostle, 1 Cor. i. <hi>The World by Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom knows not God, and God makes foolish the Wisdom of this World,</hi> never were verified to such a Degree as they are now. Great Discoveries have been made in the Arts and Sciences, and never was human Learning carried to such a Height, as in the present Age; and yet never did the Cause of Religion and Vertue run so low, in Nations professing the true Religion. Never was an Age wherein so many learned and elaborate
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:005938_0080_0000000000000000"/>
Treatises have been written, in Proof of the Truth and Divinity of the Christian Religion; yet never were there so many Infidels, among those that were brought up under the Light of the Gospel. It is an Age, as is supposed, of great Light, Freedom of Thought, and Discovery of Truth in Matters of Religion, and De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of the Weakness and Bigotry of our Ancestors, and of the Folly and Absurdity of the Notions of those that were accounted eminent Divines in former Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations; which Notions, it is imagined, did destroy the very Foundations of Vertue and Religion, and ener<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vate all Precepts of Morality, and in Effect annul all Difference between Vertue and Vice; and yet Vice and Wickedness did never so prevail, like an overflow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Deluge. 'Tis an Age wherein those mean and stingy Principles (as they are called) of our Fore-fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, which (as is suppos'd) deformed Religion, and led to unworthy Thoughts of God, are very much dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carded, and grown out of Credit, and supposed more free, noble and generous Thoughts of the Nature of Religion, and of the Christian Scheme, are entertained; But yet never was an Age, wherein Religion in general was so much despised and trampled on, and Jesus Christ and God almighty so blasphemed and treated with open daring Contempt.</p>
            <p>The exceeding <hi>Weakness</hi> of Mankind, and their <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sufficiency</hi> in themselves for the bringing to pass any Thing great and good in the World, with Regard to it's moral and spiritual State, remarkably appears in many Things that have attended and followed the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary religious Commotion, that has lately been in many Parts of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> and <hi>America.</hi> The Infir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity of the human Nature has been manifested, in a
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:005938_0081_0000000000000000"/>
very affecting Manner, in the various Passions that Men have been the Subjects of, and innumerable Ways that they have been moved, as a Reed shaken with the Wind, on Occasion of the Changes and Incidents, both publick and private, of such a State of Things. How many Errors and Extreams are we liable to? How quickly overtopped, blinded, misled, and confounded! And how easily does <hi>Satan</hi> make Fools of Men, if con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fident in their own Wisdom and Strength, and left to themselves? Many, in the late wonderful Season, were ready to admire and trust in Men, as if all depended on such and such Instruments, at least did ascribe too much to their Skill and Zeal, because God was pleased to im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove 'em a little while to do extraordinary Things; But what great Things does the Skill and Zeal of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struments do now, when the Spirit of God is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>drawn?</p>
            <p>As the present State of Things may well excite ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Desires after the promised general Revival and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of true Religion, and serve to shew our Depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dance on God for it, so there are many Things in <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> of late, that tend to <hi>encourage</hi> us in Prayer for such a Mercy. That Infidelity, Heresy and Vice do so prevail, and that Corruption and Wickedness are risen to such an extreme Height, is that which is exceeding deplorable; But yet, I think, considering God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mises to his Church, and the ordinary Method of his Dispensations, Hope may justly be gathered from it, that the present State of Things will not last long, but that a happy Change is nigh. We know, that God ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver will desert the Cause of Truth and Holiness, nor suffer the Gates of Hell to prevail against his Church; and that it has usually been so from the Beginning of the
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:005938_0082_0000000000000000"/>
World, that the State of the Church has appeared most dark, just before some remarkable Deliverance and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement: <hi>Many a Time, may</hi> Israel <hi>say, Had not the Lord been on our Side, then our Enemies would have swal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed us up quick;—The Waters had overwhelmed us.</hi> The Church's Extremity has often been God's Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for the magnifying his Power, Mercy and Faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fulness towards her. The Interest of vital Piety has long been in general decaying, and Error and Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness prevailing: It looks as tho' the Disease were now come to a Crisis, and that Things can't remain long in such a State, but that a Change may be expected in one Respect or other. And not only God's Manner of dealing with his Church in former Ages, and many Things in the Promises and Prophecies of his Word, but also several Things appertaining to present and late Aspects of divine Providence, seem to give Reason to hope that the Change will be such, as to magnify God's free Grace and sovereign Mercy, and not his revenging Justice and Wrath. There are certain Times, that are Days of Vengeance, appointed for the more special Displays of God's Justice and Indignation; and God has also his Days of Mercy, accepted Times, chosen Seasons, wherein it is his Pleasure to shew Mercy, and nothing shall hinder it; they are Times appointed for the magnifying of the Redeemer and his Merits, and the Triumphs of his Grace, wherein his Grace shall triumph over Men's Unworthiness in it's greatest Height. And if we consider God's late Dealings with our Nation and this Land, it appears to me that there is much to make us think that this Day is such a Day: Particularly God's preserving and delivering the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, when in so great Danger of Ruin by the late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bellion;
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:005938_0083_0000000000000000"/>
and his preserving <hi>New-England,</hi> and the other <hi>British</hi> Colonies in <hi>America,</hi> in so remarkable a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, from the great Armament from <hi>France,</hi> prepared and sent against us the last Year; and the almost mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous Success given to us against our Enemies at <hi>Cape-Breton</hi> the Year before, disappointing their renewed Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parations and fresh Attempt against these Colonies, this present Year 1747, by delivering up the Strength of their Fleet into the Hands of the <hi>English,</hi> as they were in their Way hither. And also in protecting us from Time to Time from Armies by Land that have come against us from <hi>Canada,</hi> since the Beginning of the present War with <hi>France.</hi> Besides many strange Instances of Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection of particular Forts and Settlements, shewing a manifest Interposition of the Hand of Heaven, to the Observation of some of our Enemies, and even of the Salvages. And added to those, the late unexpected re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>storing of the greater Part of our many Captives in <hi>Canada,</hi> by those that held them Prisoners there. It appears to me<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that God has gone much out of his usual Way, in his Exercises of Mercy, Patience and Long-Suffering in these Instances. God's Patience was very wonderful of old, towards the Ten Tribes, and the People of <hi>Iudah</hi> and <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and afterwards to the <hi>Iews</hi> in Christ's and the Apostles Times; But it seems to me, all Things considered, not equal to his Patience and Mercy to us. God don't only forbear to destroy us, notwithstanding all our Provocations and their Ag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gravations, which it would be endless to recount; but he has, in the fore-mentioned Instances, wrought great Things for us, wherein his Hand has been most visible, and his Arm made bare; especially those two Instances in <hi>America,</hi> God's succeeding us against <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi>
               <pb n="76" facs="unknown:005938_0084_0000000000000000"/>
and confounding the Armada from <hi>France</hi> the last Year; Dispensations of Providence, which, if considered in all their Circumstances, were so wonderful, and apparently manifesting an extraordinary divine Interposition, that they come perhaps the nearest to a Parallel with God's wonderful Works of Old, in <hi>Moses</hi>'s <hi>Ioshua</hi>'s, and <hi>Hezekiah</hi>'s Time, of any that have been in these latter Ages of the World. And it is to my present Purpose to observe, that God was pleased to do great Things for us in both these Instances, in Answer to extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Prayer. Such remarkable Appearances of a Spirit of Prayer, on any particular publick Occasion, have not been in the Land, at any Time within my Observation and Memory, as on Occasion of the Affair of <hi>Cape-Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ton.</hi> And 'tis worthy to be noted and remembred, that God sent that great Storm on the Fleet of our Enemies the last Year, that finally dispersed, and utterly con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>founded them, and caused them wholly to give over their Designs against us, the very Night after our Day of publick Fasting and Prayer, for our Protection and their Confusion.</p>
            <p>Thus, altho' it be a Day of great Apostacy and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vocation, yet it is apparently a Day of the wonderful Works of God; Wonders of Power and Mercy; which may well lead us to think on those two Places of Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, Psal. cxix.126. <hi>It is Time for thee, Lord, to work, for they have made void thy Law.</hi> And Psal. lxxv.1. <hi>That thy Name is near, thy wondrous Works declare.</hi>— God appears as it were loth to destroy us, or deal with us according to our Iniquities, as great and aggravated as they are; and shews that Mercy pleases him. As corrupt a Time as it is, it is plain by Experience, that it is a Time wherein God may be found, and stands
<pb n="77" facs="unknown:005938_0085_0000000000000000"/>
ready to shew Mercy in answer to Prayer. He that has done such great Things, and has so wonderfully and speedily answered Prayer for temporal Mercies, will much more give the Holy Spirit if we ask him. He marvellously preserves us, and waits to be gracious to us, as tho' he chose to make us Mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ments of his Grace, and not his Vengeance, and waits only to have us open our Mouths wide, that he may fill them.</p>
            <p>The late remarkable <hi>religious Awakenings,</hi> that have been in many Parts of the christian World, are another Thing that may justly encourage us in Prayer for the promised glorious and universal Out-pouring of the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God.
<q>In or about the Year 1732 or 1733, God was pleased to pour out his Spirit on the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of <hi>Saltzburg</hi> in <hi>Germany,</hi> who were living under Popish Darkness, in a most uncommon Manner; so that above twenty Thousand of them, meerly by reading the Bible, which they made a shift to get in their own Language, were determined to throw off Popery, and embrace the reformed Religion; yea, and to become so very zealous for the Truth and Gospel of Jesus Christ, as to be willing to suffer the Loss of all Things in the World, and actually to for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sake their Houses, Lands, Goods &amp; Relations, that they might enjoy the pure Preaching of the Gospel;—with great Earnestness, and Tears in their Eyes, beseech<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Protestant Ministers to preach to them, in Places where they (when banished from their own Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try) came, in different Places.</q>
In the Years 1734 and 1735, there appeared a very great and general A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakning, in the County of <hi>Hampshire,</hi> in the Province of the <hi>Massachusetts-Bay</hi> in <hi>New-England,</hi> and also in many Parts of <hi>Connecticut.</hi> Since This, there has been
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:005938_0086_0000000000000000"/>
a far more extensive Awakening of many Thousands in <hi>England, Wales</hi> and <hi>Scotland,</hi> and almost all the <hi>British</hi> Provinces in <hi>No<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th-America.</hi> There has also been something remarkable of the same Kind, in some Places in the <hi>United Netherlands</hi>: And about two Years ago, a very great Awakening and Reformation of many of the <hi>Indians,</hi> in the <hi>Ierseys,</hi> and <hi>Pennsylvania,</hi> even a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong such as never embraced Christianity before: And within these two Years, a great Awakening in <hi>Virginia</hi> and <hi>Maryland.</hi> Notwithstanding the great Diversity of Opinions about the Issue of some of these Awaken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings, yet I know of none that have denied that there have been great Awakenings of late, in these Times and Places, and that Multitudes have been brought to more than common Concern for their Salvation<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and for a Time were made more than ordinarily afraid of Sin, and brought to reform their former vicious Courses, and take much Pains for their Salvation. If I should be of the Opinion of those that think these Awakenings and Strivings of God's Spirit have been generally not well improved, and so, as to most, have not issued well, but have ended in Enthusiasm and Delusion, yet, that the Spirit of God has been of late so wonderfully a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wakening and striving with such Multitudes, in so many different Parts of the World, and even to this Day, in one Place or other, continues to awaken Men, is what I should take great Encouragement from, that God was about to do something more glorious, and would, before he finishes, bring Things to a greater Ripeness, and not finally suffer This Work of his to be frustrated and rendred abortive by <hi>Satan</hi>'s crafty Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagement; and that these unusual Commotions are the Forerunners of something exceeding glorious approach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing;

as the Wind, Earthquake and Fire, at Mount <hi>Sinai,</hi> were Fore-runners of that Voice, wherein God was, in a more eminent Manner; altho' <hi>they</hi> also were caused by a divine Power, as it is represented that these Things were caused by the <hi>Lord passing by,</hi> 1 Kings xix.11, 12.</p>

Psal. cxxii.3. Jerusalem <hi>is builded as a City that is com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pact together.</hi> Eph. iv.3,—6. <hi>Endeavouring to keep the Unity of the Spirit in the Bond of Peace. There is one Body, and one Spirit; even as ye are called in one Hope of your Calling; one Lord, one Faith, one Baptism, one God and Father of all, who is above all, and through all, and in you all.</hi> Ver. 16. <hi>The whole Body fitly framed together and compacted, by that which every Ioint supplieth, accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the effectual working in the Measure of every Part, maketh increase of the Body, unto the edifying itself in Love.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As 'tis the Glory of the Church of Christ, that she, in all her Members, however dispersed, is thus <hi>one,</hi> one holy Society, one City, one Family, one Body; so it is very desireable, that this Union should be <hi>manifested,</hi> and become visible; and so, that her distant Members should act as <hi>one,</hi> in those Things that concern the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Interest of the whole Body, and in those Duties and Exercises wherein they have to do with their com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Lord and Head, as seeking of him the common Prosperity. It becomes all the Members of a particular Family, who are so strictly united, and have in so many Respects one common Interest, to unite in Prayer to God for the Things they need: It becomes a Nation, in Days of Prayer, appointed by national Authority, at certain Seasons, visibly to unite in Prayer for those publick Mercies that concern the Interest of the whole Nation: So it becomes the Church of Christ, which is one holy Nation, a peculiar People, one heavenly Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mily, more strictly united, in many Respects, and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ving infinitely greater Interests that are common to the whole, than any other Society; I say, it especially be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes this Society, visibly to unite, and expresly to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree together in Prayer to God for the common Pros<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perity;
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:005938_0089_0000000000000000"/>
and above all, that common Prosperity and Advancement that is so unspeakably great and glorious, which God hath so abundantly promised to fulfill in the latter Days.</p>
            <p>It is becoming of Christians, with whose Character a narrow selfish Spirit, above all others, disagrees, to be much in Prayer for that publick Mercy, wherein con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sists the Welfare and Happiness of the whole Body of Christ, of which they are Members, and the greatest Good of Mankind. And Union or Agreement in Prayer is especially becoming, when Christians pray for that Mercy, which above all other Things concerns them unitedly, and tends to the Relief, Prosperity and Glory of the whole Body, as well as of each individual Member.</p>
            <p>Such an Union in Prayer for the general Out-pouring of the Spirit of God, would not only be beautiful, but <hi>profitable</hi> too. It would tend very much to promote Union and Charity between distant Members of the Church of Christ, and a publick Spirit, and Love to the Church of God, and Concern for the Interest of <hi>Zion</hi>; as well as be an amiable Exercise and Manifestation of such a Spirit. Union in religious Duties, especially in the Duty of Prayer, in praying one with and for ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and jointly for their common Welfare, above al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most all other Things, tends to promote mutual Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Endearment. And if Ministers and People should, by particular Agreement and joint Resolution, set themselves, in a solemn and extraordinary Manner, from Time to Time, to pray for the Revival of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion in the World, it would naturally tend more to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>waken in them a Concern about Things of this Nature, and more of a Desire after such a Mercy; it would en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage

'em to more Attention to such an Affair, make 'em more inquisitive about it, more ready to use En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavours to promote that which they, with so many others, spend so much Time in praying for, and more ready to rejoice and praise God when they see or hear of any Thing of that Nature or Tendency: And in a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Manner, would it naturally tend to engage Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nisters (the Business of whose Lives it is, to seek the Welfare of the Church of Christ, and the Advancement of his Kingdom) to greater Diligence and Earnestness in their Work: And it would have a Tendency to the spiritual Profit and Advantage of each particular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son. For Persons to be thus engaged in extraordinarily praying for the reviving and flourishing of Religion in the World, will naturally lead each one to reflect on himself, and consider how Religion flourishes in his own Heart, and how far his Example contributes to the Thing that he is praying for.</p>
            <p n="9">9. There is great and particular <hi>Encouragement</hi> gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in the Word of God, to express <hi>Union</hi> and <hi>Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> in Prayer. <hi>Daniel,</hi> when he had a great Thing to request of God, <hi>viz.</hi> That God by his holy Spirit would miraculously reveal to him a great Secret, which none of the Wise-men, Astrologers, Magicians or Soothsayers of <hi>Babylon</hi> could find out, he goes to <hi>Hana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niah, Mishael</hi> and <hi>Azariah,</hi> his Companions, and they agree together, that they will unitedly desire Mercies of the God of Heaven, concerning this Secret; and their joint Request was soon granted; and God put great Honour upon them, above all the Wise-men of <hi>Babylon,</hi> to the filling their Mouths with Praise, and to the Admiration and Astonishment of <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>;
<pb n="83" facs="unknown:005938_0091_0000000000000000"/>
insomuch that that great and haughty Monarch, as we are told, fell upon his Face and worshipped <hi>Daniel,</hi> and own'd that <hi>his God was of a Truth a God of Gods,</hi> and greatly promoted <hi>Daniel</hi> and his praying Companions in the Province of <hi>Babylon. Esther,</hi> when she had a yet more important Request to make, for the saving of the Church of God, and whole Nation of the <hi>Iews,</hi> dispersed thro' the Empire of <hi>Persia,</hi> when on the Brink of Ruin, sends to all the <hi>Iews</hi> in the City <hi>Shushan</hi> to pray and fast with her and her Maidens; and their uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Prayers prevail; so that the Event was wonderful: Instead of the intended Destruction of the <hi>Iews,</hi> the <hi>Iews</hi> Enemies are destroyed every where, and They are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, honoured and promoted, and their Sorrow and Distress is turned into great Gladness, Feasting, Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph and mutual joyful Congratulations.</p>
            <p>The Encouragement to explicit Agreement in Prayer is great from such Instances as these; but it is yet greater from those wonderful Words of our blessed Redeemer, Matth. xviii.19. <hi>I say unto you, that if any two of you shall agree on Earth touching any Thing that they shall ask, it shall be done for them of my Father which is in Heaven.</hi> Christ is pleased to give this great En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement to the Union of his Followers in this ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent and holy Exercise of seeking and serving God; an holy Union and Communion of his People being that which he greatly desires and delights in, that which he came into the World to bring to pass, that which he e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>specially prayed for with his dying Breath, <hi>Iohn</hi> xvii. that which he died for, and which was one chief End of the whole Affair of our Redemption by him; Eph. i. <hi>In whom we have Redemption through his Blood, the For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness of Sins, according to the Riches of his Grace,

<pb n="88" facs="unknown:005938_0096_0000000000000000"/>
on any social Worship without it. There is no Insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of Scripture requiring any People to meet toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther to worship God in such a Spot of Ground, or at such an Hour of the Day; But yet these must be deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined by Agreement; or else there will be no social Worship, in any Place, or any Hour. So we are not determined by Institution, what the precise Order of the different Parts of Worship shall be; what shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, and what shall follow; whether Praying or Sing<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing shall be first, and what shall be next, and what shall conclude: But yet some Order must be agreed on, by the Congregation that unite in Worship; otherwise they can't jointly carry on divine Worship, in any way or method at all. If a Congregation of Christians do agree to begin their publick Worship with Prayer, and next to sing, and then to attend on the preaching of the Word, and to conclude with Prayer; and do by Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent carry on their Worship in this Order from Year to Year; tho' this Order is not appointed in Scripture; none will call this Superstition. And if a great Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Congregations, through a whole Land, or more Lands than one, do by common Consent, keep the same Method of publick Worship; none will pretend to find Fault with it. But yet for any to go about to bind all to such a Method, would be Usurpation and Imposition. And if such a precise Order should be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded as sacred, as though no other could be accepta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to God, this would be Superstition. If a particular Number of Christians shall agree, that besides the stated publick Worship of the Sabbath, they will, when their Circumstances allow, meet together, to carry on some religious Exercises, on a Sabbath-day Night, for their mutual Edification; or if several Societies agree to meet
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:005938_0097_0000000000000000"/>
together in different Places at that Time; this is no Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition; tho' there be no Institution for it. If Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in different Congregations, voluntarily agree to take Turns to meet together in the House of God, to wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ship him and hear a publick Lecture, once a Month, or once in six Weeks; it is not unlawful; tho' there be no Institution for it: But yet, to do this as a Thing sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cred, indispensible, and binding on Men's Consciences, would be Superstition. If Christians of several neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bouring Congregations, instead of a Lecture, agree on some special Occasion to keep a circular Fast, each Congregation taking it's Turn in a certain Time and Order, fixed on by Consent; or if instead of keeping Fast by Turns, on different Days, one on one Week, and one on another, they should all agree to keep a Fast on the same Day, and to do this either once or frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, according as they shall judge their own Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances, or the Dispensations of divine Providence<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> or the Importance of the Mercy they seek, do require; neither is there any more Superstition in this than the other.</p>
            <p>OBJECT. II. Some may be ready to say, There seems to be something <hi>whimsical</hi> in it's being insisted on that God's People in different Places should put up their Prayers for this Mercy <hi>at the same Time</hi>; as tho' their Prayers would be more <hi>forceable</hi> on that Account; and as if God would not be so likely to bear Prayers offered up by many, tho' they happened not to pray at the same Time, as he would if he heard them all at the same Moment.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> To this I would say, If such an Objection be made, it must be through Misunderstandin<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="90" facs="unknown:005938_0098_0000000000000000"/>
or in any Arguments made Use of to enforce it that I have seen, that the Prayers of a great Number in diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent Places, will be more forceable, meerly because of that Circumstance, of their being put up at the same Time. It is indeed supposed, that it will be very ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient, that certain Times for united Prayer should be agreed on: Which it may be, without supposing the Thing supposed in the Objection, on the following Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counts.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This seems to be a proper Expedient for the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting and maintaining an <hi>Union</hi> among Christians of distant Places, in <hi>extraordinary Prayer</hi> for such a Mercy. It appears, from what was before observed, that there ought to be extraordinary Prayers among Christians for this Mercy; and that it is fit, that God's People should agree and unite in it. Tho' there be no Reason to suppose that Prayers will be more prevalent, meerly from that Circumstance, that different Persons pray ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>actly <hi>at the same Time</hi>; yet there will be more Reason to hope, that Prayers for such Mercy will be prevalent, when God's People are <hi>very much in Prayer</hi> for it, and when many of them <hi>are united</hi> in it. And therefore if agreeing on certain Times for united and extraordinary Prayer, be a likely Means to promote an Union of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny in extraordinary Prayer, then there is more Reason to hope, that there will be prevalent Prayer for such a Mercy, for certain Times for extraordinary Prayer be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing agreed on. But that agreeing on certain Times for united extraordinary Prayer, is a likely and proper Means to promote and maintain such Prayer, I think will be easily evident to any one that considers the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. If there should be only a loose Agreement or Consent to it as a Duty, or a Thing fit and proper,
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:005938_0099_0000000000000000"/>
that Christians should be much in Prayer for the Revi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val of Religion, and much more in it than they used to be, without agreeing on particul<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>ble would such a lax Agreement be to be soon forgotten, and that extraordinary Prayerfulness, which is fixed to no certain Times, to be totally neglected? To be sure, distant Parts of the Church of Christ could have no Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence in one another, that this would not be the Case.

               </gap>sal they have made, or any other Ministers or Christians in any Part of the christian World, had sent abroad on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly a general Proposal, that God's People should, for Time to come, be much more in Prayer for the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement of Christ's Kingdom, than had been common among Christians heretofore; and they should hear their Proposal was generally allowed to be good; and that Ministers and People, in one Place and another, that had occasion to speak their Minds upon it, own'd that it was a very proper Thing, that Christians should pray more for this Mercy than they generally used to do; could they, from this only, have in any Measure the like Grounds of Dependance, that God's People, in various Parts of the christian World, would indeed henceforward act unitedly, in maintaining extraordinary Prayer for this Mercy, as if they should not only hear that the Duty in general was approved of, but also that particular Times were actually fix'd on for the Purpose, and an Agreement and joint Resolution was come into, that they would, unless extraordinarily hindred, set a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part such particular Seasons to b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <pb n="92" facs="unknown:005938_0100_0000000000000000"/>2. For God's People in distant Places to agree on certain Times for extraordinary Prayer, wherein they will unitedly put up their Requests to God, is a Means fit and proper to be used, in order to the <hi>Visibility</hi> of their Union in such Prayer. Union among God's Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in Prayer is truly beautiful, as has been before ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served and shewn; 'tis beautiful in the Eyes of Christ, and 'tis justly beautiful and amiable in the Eyes of Christians. And if so, then it must needs be desirable to Christians that such Union should be visible. If it would be a lovely Sight in the Eyes of the Church of Christ, and much to their Comfort, to behold various and different Parts of the Church united in extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Prayer for the general Outpouring of the Spirit, then it must be desireable to them that such an Union should be visible, that they may behold it; for if it ben't visible, it can't be beheld. But Agreement and Union in a Multitude in their Worship becomes visible, by an Agreement in some external visible Circumstances. Worship it self becomes visible Worship, by something external and visible belonging to the Worship, and no other Way: Therefore Union and Agreement of many in Worship becomes visible no other Way, but by U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion and Agreement in the external and visible Acts and Circumstances of the Worship. Such Union and Agreement becomes visible, particularly by an Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in those two visible Circumstances, <hi>Time,</hi> and <hi>Place.</hi> When a Number of Christians live near toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and their Number and Situation is convenient, and they have a Desire visibly to unite in any Acts of Worship, they are wont to make their Union and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement visible by an Union in both these Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stances. But when a much greater Number of Christi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,

dwelling in distant Places, so that they can't unite by worshipping in the same Place, and yet desire a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Union in some extraordinary Worship; they are wont to make their Union and Agreement visible, by agreeing only in the former of those Circumstances, <hi>viz.</hi> that of Time: As is common in the Appointment of publick Fasts and Thanksgivings; the same Day is ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, for the Performance of that extraordinary Worship, by all those Christians, in different Places, that it is intended should be united therein, as a visible Note of their Union. This the common Light and Sense of God's People leads Christians to, in all Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries. And the Wisdom of God seems to dictate the same Thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>g, in appointing that his People, thro' the World, in all Ages, in their stated and ordinary publick Worship, every Week, should manifest this Union and Communion one with another, in their Worship, as one holy Society, and great Congregation of Wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>shippers, and Servants of God; by offering up their Worship on the same Day; for the greater Glory of their common Lord, and the greater Edification and Comfort of the whole Body.</p>
            <p>If any yet find Fault with the Proposal of certain Times to be agreed on by God's People in different Places, in the Manner set forth in <hi>the Memorial,</hi> I would ask whether they object against <hi>any such Thing,</hi> as a visible Agreement of God's People, in different Parts of the World, in extraordinary Prayer, for the Coming of Christ's Kingdom? Whether such a Thing, being visible, would not be much for the publick Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of God's Name? And whether it would not tend to Christians Assistance, Quickening and Encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in the Duty united in, by mutual Example, and
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:005938_0102_0000000000000000"/>
also to their mutual Comfort, by a Manifestation of that Union which is amiable to Christ and Christians, and to promote a christian Union among professing Christians in general? And whether we han't Reason to think, from the Word of God, that before that great Revival of Religion foretold is accomplished, there will be a visible Union of the People of God, in various Parts of the World, in extraordinary Prayer, for this Mercy? If these Things are allowed, I would then ask further, whether any Method can be thought of or devised, whereby an express Agreement, and visible Union of God's People, in different Parts of the World, can be come into, and maintained, but this, or some other equivalent to it? If there be any express Agreement about any extraordinary Prayer at all, it must first be proposed by some, and others must fall in, in the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner as is represented in my Text. And if extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Prayer be agreed on and maintained by many in different Places, visibly one to another, then it must be agreed in some Respect, and with Regard to some Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances, what extraordinary Prayer shall be kept up; and it must be seen and heard of, from one to another, what extraordinary Prayer is kept up. But how shall this be, when no Times are agreed upon, and it is ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver known nor heard, by those in different Parts, nor is in any Respect visible to them, when, or how often, those in one Town or Country, and another, do attend this extraordinary Prayer? And the Consequence must necessarily be, that it can never be known how far, or in what Respect others join with them in extraordinary Prayer, or whether they do it at all; and not so much as one Circumstance of extraordinary Prayer will be visible; and indeed nothing will be visible about i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>. So
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:005938_0103_0000000000000000"/>
that I think that any Body that well considers the Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, will see that he that determines to oppose such a Method as is proposed to us in the Memorial, and all others equivalent to it, is in Effect determined to oppose there ever being any such Thing at all, as an agreed and visibly united, extraordinary Prayer, in the Church of God, for a general Out-pouring of the Spirit.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Though it would not be reasonable, to suppose, that meerly such a Circumstance of Prayer, as many People's praying at the same Time will directly have any Influence or Prevalence with <hi>God,</hi> to cause him to be the more ready to hear Prayer; yet such a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance may reason<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>ence upon his Mind, to excite and encourage him, or in any Respect to assist him, in his Worship? The Encouragement or Help that one that joins with an Assembly in worshipping God, has in his Worship, by others being united with him, is not meerly by any Thing that he immediately perceives by Sight, or any
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:005938_0104_0000000000000000"/>
other of the external Senses (for Union in Worship is not a Thing objected to the external Senses) But by the Notice or Knowledge the Mind has of that Union, or the Satisfaction the Understanding has that others, at that Time, have their Minds engaged with him in the same Service: Which may be, when those unitedly engaged are at a Distance one from another, as well as when they are present. If one be present in a worship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping Assembly, and is not blind, and sees others pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent, and sees their external Behaviour; their Union and Engagedness with him in Worship, is what he does not see: And what he sees encourages and assists him in his Worship, only as he takes it as an Evidence of that Union and Concurrence in his Worship, that is out of his Sight. And Persons may have Evidence of this concerning Persons that are absent, that may give him as much Satisfaction of their Union with him, as if they were present. And therefore the Consideration of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers being at the same Time engaged with him in Worship, that are absent, may as reasonably animat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> and encourage him in his Worship, as if they were present.</p>
            <p>There is no Wisdom in finding Fault with human Nature, as God has made it. Things that exist now, at this present Time, are in themselves no more weighty or important, than like Things, and of equal Reality, that existed in Time past, or are to exist in Time to come: Yet 'tis evident that the Consideration of Things being present (at least in most Cases) does especially affect human Nature. As for Instance, If a Man could be certainly informed, that his dear Child at a Distance, was now under some extreme Suffering; or that an absent most dear Friend, was at this Time
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:005938_0105_0000000000000000"/>
thinking of him, and in the Exercise of great Affection towards him, or in the Performance of some great Deed of Friendship; or if a pious Parent should know that now his Child was in the act of some enormous Wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; or that, on the contrary, he was now in some eminent Exercise of Grace, and in the Performance of an extraordinary Deed of Vertue and Piety; would not those Things be more affecting to the human Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, for being considered as Things that are in Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>istence, at the present Time, than if consider'd as at some Distance of Time, either past or future? Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreds of other Instances might <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> mentioned wherein it is no less plain, that the Consideration of the present Existence of Things, gives them Advantage to affect the Minds of Men. Yea, 'tis undoubtedly so with Things in general, that take any Hold at all of our Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections, and towards which we are not indifferent. And if the Mind of a particular Child of God is disposed to be affected by the Consideration of the Religion of other Saints, and with their Union and Concurrence with him in any particular Duty or Act of Religion, I can see no Reason why the human Mind should not be more moved by the Object of it's Affection, when con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered as present, as well in this Case, as in any other Case: Yea I think we may on good Grounds deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine there is none.</p>
            <p>Nor may we look upon it as an Instance of the pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Weakness of the human Nature, that Men are more affected with Things that are considered as present, than those that are distant: But it seems to be a Thing common to finite Minds, and so to all created intelli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gent Beings. Thus, the Angels in Heaven have pecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liar Joy, on Occasion of the Conversion of a Sinner,
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:005938_0106_0000000000000000"/>
when recent, beyond what they have in that which has been long past. If any therefore shall call it silly and whimsical in any, to value and regard such a Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance, in Things of Religion, as their existing at the present Time, so as to be the more affected with 'em for that; must call the Host of Angels in Heaven a parcel of silly and whimsical Beings.</p>
            <p>I remember, the <hi>Spectator</hi> (whom none will call a whimsical Author) somewhere speaking of different Ways of dear Friends mutually expressing their Affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and maintaining a Kind of Intercourse, in Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sence one from another, mentions such an Instance as this, with much Approbation, <hi>viz.</hi> That two Friends, that were greatly endeared one to another, when about to part, and to be for a considerable Time necessarily absent, that they might have the Comfort of the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of daily mutual Expressions of Friendship, in their Absence; agreed that they would, every Day, precise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly at such an Hour, retire from all Company an<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Busi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, to pray one for another. Which Agreement they so valued, and so strictly observed, that when the Hour came, scarce any Thing would hinder 'em. And ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther than miss the Opportunity, they would suddenly break off Conversation, and abruptly leave Company they were engaged with.—If this be a desirable Way of Intercourse of particular Friends, is it not a desirable and amiable Way of maintaining Intercourse and Fel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowship between Brethren in Christ Jesus, and the vari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Members of the holy Family of God, in different Parts of the World, to come into an Agreement, that they will set apart certain Times, which they will spend with one Accord, in extraordinary Prayer to their hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Father, for the Advancement of the Kingdom
<pb n="99" facs="unknown:005938_0107_0000000000000000"/>
and Glory of their common dear Lord and Saviour, and for each other's Prosperity and Happiness, and the greatest Good of all their Fellow-Creatures through the World?</p>
            <p>OBJECT. III. Some perhaps may object, That it looks too much like <hi>Pharisaism,</hi> when Persons engage in any such extraordinary religious Exercises, beyond what is appointed by express Institution, for them thus designedly to make it manifest abroad in the World, and so openly to distinguish themselves from others.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. All open engaging in extraordinary Exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cises of Religion, not expresly enjoined by Institution, is not <hi>Pharisaism,</hi> nor has ever been so reputed in the Christian Church. As when a particular Church or Congregation of Christians agree together to keep a Day of Fasting and Prayer, on some special Occasion; or when publick Days of Fasting and Thanksgiving are kept, throughout a Christian Province or Country: And tho' it be ordinarily the Manner for the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate to lead in the setting apart such Days; yet that alters not the Case: If it be Pharisaism in the So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety openly <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>o agree in such extraordinary Exercises of Religion, it is not less Pharisaism, for the Heads of the Society leading in the Affair. And if that were now the Case with the Christian Church, that once was, for about three hundred Years together, that the civil Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gistrate was not of the Society of Christians, nor con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern'd himself in their Affairs; yet this would not ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it the less suitable for Christians, on proper Occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, jointly, and visibly one to another, to engage in such extraordinary Exercises of Religion, and to keep Days of F<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>sting and Thanksgiving by Agreement.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="100" facs="unknown:005938_0108_0000000000000000"/>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. As to the latter Part of the Objection, there can be no Room for it in this Case. It can't be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected against what is proposed in the Memorial, that if Persons should comply with it, it would look like af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fecting Singularity, and open Distinction from others of God's professing People, in extraordinary Religion, such as was in the <hi>Pharisees</hi> of old: Because 'tis evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, the very Design of the <hi>Memorial,</hi> is not to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote Singularity and Distinction, but as much as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to avoid and prevent it. The End of the <hi>Memorial</hi> is not to confine and limit the Thing proposed, that it may be practised only by a Few in Distinction from the Generality; but on the contrary to extend it, and make it as general among professing Christians as possi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. Some had complied with the extraordinary Duty proposed, and therein had been distinguished from o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, for two Years, before the Memorial was publish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; and they were more distinguished than they desi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red; and therefore send abroad this Memorial, that the Practice might be more spread, and become more gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral, that they might be less distinguished. What they evidently seek, is to bring to pass as general a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance as possible of Christians of all Denominations, <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treating that the Desire of Concurrence and Assistance, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in the Memorial, may by no Means be understood, as restricting to any particular Denomination or Party, or those who are of such or such Opinions about any former Instances of remarkable religious Concern; but to be extended to all, who shall vouchsafe any Attention to the Proposal, and have at Heart the Interest of vital Christianity, and the Power of Godliness; and who, however differing about other Things, are convinced of the Importance of fervent Prayer, to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote
<pb n="101" facs="unknown:005938_0109_0000000000000000"/>
that common Interest, and of Scripture-Perswasives, to promote such Prayer.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>OBJECT. IV. Another Objection, that is very likely to arise in the Minds of many against such extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Prayer as is proposed for the speedy Coming of Christ's Kingdom, is that we have <hi>no Reason to expect it,</hi> 'till there first come a Time of most extreme <hi>Calamity</hi> to the Church of God, and Prevalence of her <hi>antichristian</hi> Enemies against her; even that which is represented, Rev. xi. by the <hi>slaying of the Witnesses</hi>; but have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to determine the Contrary.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> It is an Opinion that seems pretty much to have obtained, that before the Fulfilment of the Promises rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to the Church's Latter-day Glory, there must come a most terrible Time, a Time of extreme Suffering, and dreadful Persecution of the Church of Christ; wherein <hi>Satan</hi> and <hi>Antichrist</hi> are to obtain their greatest Victory over her, and she is to be brought lower than ever by her Enemies. Which Opinion has chiefly ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen from the Manner of interpreting and applying the forementioned Prophecy of the slaying of the Witnesses. This Opinion, with such Persons as retain it, must needs be a grea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> Restraint and Hindrance, with Regard to such an Affair as is proposed to us in the Memorial. If Persons expect no other, than that the more the glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Times of Christ's Kingdom are hastened, the sooner will come this dreadful Time, wherein the Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of God's People must suffer so extremely, and the Church of Christ be almost extinguished, and blot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted out from under Heaven; how can it be otherwise, than a great Damp to their Hope, Courage and Activity, in praying for, and reaching after the speedy Introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:005938_0110_0000000000000000"/>
of those glorious promised Times? As long as this Opinion is retained, it will undoubtedly ever have this unhappy Influence on the Minds of these that wish well to <hi>Zion,</hi> and savour her Stones and Dust. It will tend to damp, deaden and keep down, Life, Hope and joyful Expectation in Prayer; and even in great Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to prevent all earnest, animated and encouraged Prayer, in God's People, for this Mercy, at any Time before it is actually fulfilled. For they that proceed on this Hypothesis in their Prayer<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, must, at the same Time that they pray for this glorious Day, naturally conclude within themselves, that they shall never live to see on the Earth any Dawning of it, but only to see the dismal Time that shall preceed it, in w<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ich the far greater Part of God's People, that shall live 'till then, shall die under the extreme Cruelties of their Persecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors. And the more they expect that God will answer their Prayers, by speedily bringing on the promised glorious Day, the more must they withal expect, them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves, to have a Share in those dreadful Things, that Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture shrinks at the Thoughts of, and also expect to see Things that a renewed Nature shrinks at and dreads; even the prevailing of God's Enemies, and the almost total Extinguishing the true Religion in the World. And on this <hi>Hypothesis,</hi> these Discouragements are like to attend the Prayers of God's People, 'till that dismal Time be actually come: And when that is come, those that had been prophesying and praying in Sackcloth, shall generally be slain: And after that Time is over, then the glorious Day shall immediately commence. So that this Notion tends to discourage and hinder all ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nest Prayer in the Church of God for that glorious
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:005938_0111_0000000000000000"/>
Coming of Christ's Kingdom, 'till it be actually come; and that is to hinder it's ever being at all.</p>
            <p>It being so, this Opinion being of such hurtful Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency, certainly it is a thousand Pities it should prevail and be retained, if truely there be no good Ground fo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> it.</p>
            <p>Therefore in Answer to this Objection, I would with all Humility and Modesty, examine the Foundati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of that Opinion, of such a dreadful Time of Victory of Antichrist over the Church, yet to be expected: And particularly shall endeavour to shew that the <hi>slaying of the Witnesses,</hi> foretold <hi>Rev.</hi> xi.7,—10. is not an Event that remains yet to be fulfilled.—To this End, I would propose the following Things to Consideration.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The Time wherein the <hi>Witnesses lie dead in the Streets of the great City,</hi> doubtless signifies the Time wherein the true Church of Christ is lowest of all, most of all prevailed against by Antichrist, and nearest to <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> utter Extinction; the Time wherein there is left the least Visibility of the Church of Christ yet subsisting in the World, least remains of any Thing appertaining to true Religion, whence a Revival of it can be expected, and wherein all Means of it are most abolished, and the State of the Church is in all Respects furthest from any Thing whence any Hopes of it's ever flourishing again might arise.—For before this, the Witnesses <hi>pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phesy in Sackcloth</hi>; but now they are <hi>dead</hi>: Before this, they were kept low indeed, yet there was Life, and Power to bring Plagues on their Enemies, and so much of true Religion left, as to be a continual Eye-sore and Torment to them; but now their Enemies rejoice and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>aft, and have a general publick Triumph, as having obtained a full Victory over them, and having entirely
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:005938_0112_0000000000000000"/>
extirpated them, and being compleatly delivered from them, and all that might give 'em any Fear of being ever troubled with them any more. This Time, wherever it be fixed, doubtless is the Time, not only, wherein fewest Professors of the true Religion are left in the World; but a Time wherein the Truth shall be farthest out of Sight, and out of Reach, and most for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten; wherein there are left fewest Beams of Light or Traces of Truth, fewest Means of Information, and Opportunities of coming to the Knowledge of the Truth; and so a Time of the most barbarous Ignorance, most destitute of all History, Reliques, Monuments and Memory of Things appertaining to true Religion, or Things, the Knowledge of which hath any Tendency to bring Truth again to Light; and most destitute of Learning, Study and Enquiry.</p>
            <p>Now, if we consider the present State of Mankind, is it credible, that a Time will yet come in the World, that in these Respects exceeds all Times that were be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Reformation? and that such a Time will come before the Fall of Antichrist, unless we set that at a much greater Distance, than the farthest that any have yet supposed? 'Tis next to impossible, that such a Change should be brought about in so short a Time: It cannot be without a Miracle. In order to it, not only must the popish Nation<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> so prevail, as utterly to extirpate the Protestant Religion thro' the Earth; but must do many other Things, far more impossible for them to effect, in order to cover the World with so gross and confirmed a Darkness, and to bury all Light and Truth in so deep an Oblivion, and so far out of all Means and Hopes of a Revival. And not only must a vast Change be made in the <hi>Protestant</hi> World, but the
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:005938_0113_0000000000000000"/>
               <hi>popish</hi> Nations must be strangely metamorphosed; and they themselves must be terribly Persecuted by some o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Power, in order to bring them to such a Change: Nor would Persecution without Extirpation be suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent for it. If there should be another universal Deluge, it might be sufficient to bring Things in the World to such a Pass; provided a few ignorant barbarous Persons only were preserved in an Ark: And it would require some Catastrophe, not much short of this, to effect it.</p>

               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned Destruction of Antichrist, that dreadful Enemy that had long oppressed and worn out the Saints, was begun; nor was it a small Beginning, but Antichrist hath fallen, at least, half-way to the Ground, from that Height of Power and Grandeur, that he was in before. Then began the Vials of God's Wrath to be <hi>poured out on the Throne of the Beast,</hi> to the great Shaking of it's Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and Diminution of it's Extent; so that the <hi>Pope</hi> lost near half of his former Dominions: And as to De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree of Authority and Influence over what is left, he is not now possessed of what he had before. God now at length, in answer to the long-continued Cries of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, awaked as one out of Sleep, and began to deliver his Church from her exceeding low State, that she had continued in for many Ages, under the great Oppression of this grand Enemy, and to restore her from her Exile and Bondage in the spiritual <hi>Babylon</hi> and <hi>Egypt.</hi> And 'tis not agreable to the Analogy of God's Dispensations, that after this, God should desert his People, and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

should be entirely given up and lost, and the Power and Tyranny of Antichrist be more confirmed, and the Church brought more under, and more entirely subdu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed than ever before, and further from all Help and Means to recover. This is not God's Way of dealing with his People, or with their Enemies: His Work of Salvation is perfect: When he has begun such a Work he will carry it on: When he once causes the Day of Deliverance to dawn to his People, after such a long Night of dismal Darkness, he will not extinguish the Light, and cause them to return again to Midnight-Darkness: When he has begun to enkindle the blessed Fire, he will not quench the smoking Flax, 'till he hath brought forth Judgment unto Victory. When once the Church, after her long Labour and sore Travail, has brought forth her Man-Child, and wrought some Deliverance, her Enemies shall never be able to destroy this Child, tho' an Infant; but it shall ascend up to Heaven, and be set on high out of their Reach.</p>
            <p>The Destruction that God often foretold and threatned to ancient <hi>Babylon</hi> (which is often refer'd to in the Revelation, as a great Type of the antichristian Church) was gradually accomplished, and fulfil'd by various Steps, at a great Distance of Time one from a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother: It was begun in the Conquest of <hi>Cyrus,</hi> and was further accomplished by <hi>Darius,</hi> about <hi>eighteen</hi> Years after, by a yet greater Destruction, wherein it was brought much nea<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>er to utter Desolation; but it was about <hi>two hundred and twenty three</hi> Years after this, before the Ruin of it was perfected, and the Prophecies against it fully accomplished, in it's being made an ut<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and perpetual Desolation, without any human In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habitant, becoming the Dwelling-Place for Owls, Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gons
<pb n="107" facs="unknown:005938_0115_0000000000000000"/>
and other doleful Creatures. But yet when God had once begun to destroy her, he went on 'till he finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and never suffered her any more to recover and establish her former Empire. So the Restitution of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church, after the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity, was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dual, by various Steps; there were several Times of Return of the <hi>Iews</hi> from Captivity, and several distinct Decrees of the <hi>Persian</hi> Emperors, for the restoring and rebuilding <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> and re-establishing the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church and State; and it was done in turbulent Times; there were great Interruptions and Checks, and violent Oppositions, and Times wherein the Enemy did much prevail: But yet, when God had once begun the Work, he also made an End; he never suffered the Enemies of the <hi>Iews</hi> to bring <hi>Ierusalem</hi> to such a State of Desola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as it had been in before, 'till the promised Restora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion was compleat. Again, The Deliverance of God's Church from the Oppression of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> (another known Type of Antichrist) was gradual; they were first holpen with a little Help, by the <hi>Mac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cabees</hi>; and afterwards the promised Deliverance was compleated, in the Recovery of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the Temple, the miserable End of <hi>Antiochus,</hi> and the consequent more full Deliverance of the whole Land. But after God once began to appear for the Help of his Church in that Instance, after it seem'd dead and past all Hope, he never suffered <hi>Antiochus</hi> to prevail against his People, to that Degree, again; tho' the utmost Strength of this great Monarch was used, from Time to Time, in order to it, and his vast Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire was engaged against an Handful that opposed them: God never forsook the Work of his own Hand; when he had begun to deliver his People, he also made an End.
<pb n="108" facs="unknown:005938_0116_0000000000000000"/>
And so <hi>Haman,</hi> that proud and inveterate Enemy of the <hi>Iews,</hi> that thought to extirpate the whole Nation, who also was probably another Type of Antichrist, when he began to fall before <hi>Esther</hi> and <hi>Mordecai,</hi> never stay'd, 'till his Ruin, and the Church's Deliverance was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleat. <hi>Haman</hi>'s Wife speaks of it, as an Argument of his approaching inevitable full Destruction, that he <hi>had be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gun to fall,</hi> Esth. vi.15.</p>
            <p n="3">3. If it should be so, that <hi>Antichristian</hi> Tyranny and Darkness should hereafter so prevail against the Protes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tant-Church, and the true Religion, and every Thing appertaining to it, as to bring Things to the Pass fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentioned, this would hardly so properly <hi>answer the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy</hi> of slaying the <hi>two</hi> Witnesses; for doubtless, one Reason why they are called <hi>two Witnesses,</hi> is that the Number of the remaining Witnesses for the Truth, was, tho' sufficient, yet very small. Which was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markably the Case, in the dark Times of Popery: but since the Reformation, the Number of those appearing on the Side of true Religion, has been far from being so small. The visible Church of Christ has been vastly large, in comparison of what it was before: The Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of Protestants has sometimes been thought near e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>qual to that of the Papists; and doubtless the Number of true Saints has been far greater than before.</p>
            <p n="4">4. It seems to be signified in Prophecy, that after the Reformation <hi>Antichrist</hi> should <hi>never</hi> prevail against the Church of Christ any more, as he had done before. I can't but think, that whoever reads and well considers what the learned Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> has written on the five first Vials, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvi. in his late Exposition on the <hi>Reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> must think it to be very manifest, that what is said Ver. 10 of the pouring out of the fifth Vial <hi>on the
<pb n="109" facs="unknown:005938_0117_0000000000000000"/>
Throne of the Beast,</hi> (for so it is in the Original) is a a Prophecy of the Reformation. Then the Vial of God's Wrath was poured out on the Throne of the Beast, i. e. according to the Language of Scripture, on his Authority and Dominion, greatly to weaken and diminish it, both in Extent and Degree. But when this is represented in the Prophecy, then it is added, <hi>and his Kingdom was full of Darkness, and they gnawed their Tongue for Pain.</hi> If we consider what is commonly in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended by such-like Phrases in the Scripture, I think we shall be naturally, and as it were necessarily led to un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derstand those Words thus; Their Policy, by which heretofore they have prevailed, shall now fail them; their Authority shall be weakened, and their Dominion greatly diminished, and all their Craft and Subtilty shall not avail them to maintain and support the Throne of the Beast, or ever again to extend his Authority so far as it had been before extended, and to recover what it lost; but all their crafty Devices to this End shall be attended with vexatious tormenting Disappointment; they that have the Management of the Affairs of the Beast's Kingdom, shall henceforward grope as in the Dark, and stumble, and be confounded in their Purposes, Plots and Enterprizes; formerly their Policy was great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly successful, was as a Light to guide 'em to their Ends, but now their Kingdom shall be full of Darkness, and their Wisdom shall fail 'em in all their Devices to sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>due, and again to bring under the Church of God.— The Scripture takes Notice of the great Policy and Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tilty of the Powers that support this Kingdom, Dan. vii.8. <hi>And behold, in this Horn were Eyes like the Eyes of a Man.</hi> So it is said of <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> that great Type of Antichrist, Dan. viii.23. <hi>A King of
<pb n="110" facs="unknown:005938_0118_0000000000000000"/>
fierce Countenance, and understanding dark Sentences, shall stand up.</hi> Ver. 25. <hi>And through his Policy also, shall be cause Craft to prosper in his Hand.</hi> This Understanding and Policy is the Light of this Kingdom, as true Wis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom is the Light of the spiritual <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> And there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore when this Light fails, then may the Kingdom of this spiritual <hi>Egypt</hi> be said to be full of Darkness. God henceforward will defend his People from these mystical <hi>Egyptians,</hi> as he defended <hi>Israel</hi> of old from <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and his Host, when pursuing after them, by placing a Cloud and Darkness in their Way, and so not suffering them to come nigh. So he will protect his Church from the Men of <hi>that City that is spiritually cal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led</hi> Sodom, as <hi>Lot</hi>'s House, wherein were the Angels, was defended from the Men of <hi>Sodom,</hi> by their being smitten with Darkness or Blindness, so that they wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves to find the Door; And as God defended the City in which was <hi>Elisha</hi> the Prophet and Witness of the Lord, from the <hi>Syrians,</hi> when they compassed it about with Horses and Chariots and a great Host to apprehend him, by smiting them with Blindness. The Scripture teaches us, that God is wont in this Way to defend his Church and People from their crafty and powerful Enemies; Job. v.11, &amp;c. <hi>To set up high those that be low, that those which mourn may be exalted to Safety: He disappointeth the Devices of the Crafty, so that their Hands cannot perform their Enterprize: He taketh the Wise in their own Craftiness, and the Counsel of the Froward is carried Headlong: They meet with Darkness in the Day-time, and grope in the Noon day as in the Night; but he saveth the poor from the Sword, from their Month, and from the Hand of the Mighty.</hi> Psal. xxxv.4, 6. <hi>Let them be confounded and put to Shame, that seek after my
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:005938_0119_0000000000000000"/>
Soul; let them be turned back, and brought to Confusion, that devise my Hurt—Let their Way be dark and slippery.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Upon the Account of such Defence of God's Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>testant Church, and Disappointment and Confusion of all the subtil Devices, deep-laid Schemes, and furious Attempts of their antichristian Enemies, to bring them under, and root them out, and their seeing them still maintaining their Ground, and subsisting in an Indepen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dency on them, in Spite of all that they do, makes them as it were gnash their Teeth, and bite their Tongues for meer Rage and Vexation; agreable to Psal. cxii.9, 10. <hi>His Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teousness endureth for ever, his Horn shall be exalted with Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour: The Wicked shall-see it and be grieved, and gnash with his Teeth and melt away: The Desire of the Wicked shall perish.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Hitherto this Prophecy has been very signally fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led; since the Reformation, the Kingdom of Antichrist has been remarkably fill'd with Darkness in this Respect. Innumerable have been the crafty Devices, and great Attempts of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> wherein they have exerted their utmost Policy and Power, to recover their lost Dominions, and again to subjugate the Protestant Nations, and subdue the northern Heresy, as they call it. They have wearied themselves in these Endeavours for more than <hi>two hundred</hi> Years past. But have hi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therto been disappointed; and have often been strangely confounded. When their Matters seemed to be bro't to a Ripeness, and they triumphed as tho' their Point was gained, their Joy and Triumph has suddenly turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into Vexation and Torment. How many have been their politick and powerful Attempts against the Protestant Interest in our Nation, in particular? And how wonderfully had God disappointed them from Time to Time! And as God has hitherto so remarka<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:005938_0120_0000000000000000"/>
fulfill'd his Word in defending his Protestant Church from Antichrist, so I think we have Ground to trust in him, that he will defend it to the End.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The <hi>Hypothesis</hi> of those that suppose the slaying of the Witnesses is a Thing that yet remains to be fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, makes the Prophecies of the <hi>Revelation</hi> to be <hi>incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sistent</hi> one with another. According to their <hi>Hypothe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sis,</hi> that Battle <hi>Rev.</hi> xi.7. wherein the Beast makes War with the Witnesses, and overcomes them, and kills them, is the last and greatest Conflict between An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist and the Church of Christ, that is to preceed the utter Overthrow of the antichristian Kingdom. And they must suppose so; for they suppose, that im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately after the Sufferings the Church shall endure in that War, she shall arise, and as it were ascend into Heaven; i. e. as they interpret it, the Church shall be directly advanced to her latter-day Rest, Prosperity and Glory. And consequently, this Conflict must be the same with that great Battle between Antichrist and the Church, that is described Chap. xvi.13, to the End, and more largely Chap. xix.11, to the End. For that which is described in these Places, is most evident<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly and indisputably the greatest and last Battle or Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict that shall be between the Church and her antichris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Enemies; on which the utter Downfall of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and the Church's Advancement to her latter-day Glory, shall be immediately consequent. And so the Earthquake that attends the Resurrection of the Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses Chap. xi.13, must be the same with that great Earthquake that is described, Chap. xvi.18. And the falling of the tenth Part of the City must be the same with that terrible and utter Destruction of Antichrist's Kingdom, Chap. xvi.17, to the End.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="113" facs="unknown:005938_0121_0000000000000000"/>But these Things can't be. The Battle Chap. xi.7. can't be the same with that last and great Battle be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the Church and Antichrist, described Chap. xvi, and xix. For the Things that are said of one and the other, and their Issue, are in no wise consistent. In that Battle, Chap. xi. the Church of God conflicts with her Enemies in Sorrow, Sackcloth, and Blood: but in the other the Matter is represented exceedingly other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wise; the Church goes forth to fight with Antichrist, not in Sackcloth and Blood, but cloathed in white Rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, Christ himself before them, as their Captain, going forth in great Pomp and Magnificence, upon a <hi>white Horse,</hi> and <hi>on his Head many Crowns,</hi> and <hi>on his Vesture and on his Thigh a Name written,</hi> KING OF KINGS AND LORD OF LORDS; and the Saints that follow so glorious a Leader to this great Battle, follow him on <hi>white Horses, cloathed in fine Linnen, white and clean,</hi> in Garments of Strength, Joy, Glory and Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph; in the same Kind of Raiment, that the Saints appear in, when they are represented as triumphing with Christ, with Palms in their Hands, Chap. vii.<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> And the Issue of the latter of these Conflicts, is quite the Reverse of the former. In that Battle, Chap. xi.7. <hi>The Beast makes War with the Witnesses, and</hi> OVER<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>COMES THEM, AND KILLS THEM: The same is foretold Dan. vii.21. <hi>I beheld, and the same Horn made War with the Saints, and prevailed against them.</hi> And Rev. xii.7. <hi>And it was given unto him to make War with the Saints, and to overcome them.</hi> But in the Issue of that l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>st and great Battle, which the Church shall have with her antichristian Enemies, the Church shall OVERCOME THEM, AND KILL THEM; Rev. xvii.14. <hi>These shall make War with the Lamb, and the Lamb shall overcome them; for he is Lord of Lords, and King of
<pb n="114" facs="unknown:005938_0122_0000000000000000"/>
Kings; and they that are with him, are called and chosen and faithful.</hi> compared with Chap. xix.16, and fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Verses, and Chap. xvi.16, 17. In the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict that the Beast shall have with the Witnesses, the <hi>Beast kills them, and their dead Bodies lie unburied</hi>; as tho' they were to be Meat for the Beasts of the Earth &amp; Fowls of Heaven: But in that last great Battle, 'tis represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted that Christ and his Church <hi>shall slay their Enemies, and give their dead Bodies to be Meat for the Fowls of Heaven,</hi> Chap. xix.17, to the End. There is no Manner of Apearance, in the Descriptions that are gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven of that last great Battle, of any Advantages gained in it, by the Enemies of the Church, before they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves are overcome; but all Appearance of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary. Be sure the Descriptions in the xvi and xix Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Revelation</hi> will by no means allow of such an Advantage, as the overcoming God's People, and slay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them, and their lying dead for some Time, and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buried, that their dead Bodies may be for their Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies to abuse, and trample on, and make Sport with. In Chap. xvi we read of their being gathered together against the Church, a mighty Host, into the Place called <hi>Armageddon</hi>; and then the first Thing we hear of, is the pouring out the seventh Vial of God's Wrath, and a Voice saying, <hi>It is done.</hi> And so in the xix Chap. we have an Account of <hi>the Beast, and the Kings of the Earth, and their Armies, being gathered together to make War a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst him that sat on the Horse, and against his Army.</hi> And then the next Thing we hear of, is, that <hi>the Beast is taken, and with him the false Prophet</hi>; and that <hi>these are both cast alive into the Lake of Fire</hi>; and that <hi>the Rem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of their vast Army are slain, and all the Fowls filled with their Flesh.</hi> The Issue of the Conflict of the
<pb n="115" facs="unknown:005938_0123_0000000000000000"/>
Beast with the Witnesses, is the Triumph of the Church's Enemies over God's People, looking on them as entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly vanquished, and their Interest utterly ruined, past all Possibility of Recovery; <hi>They that dwell on the Earth shall see the dead Bodies of the Saints lying in the Streets of the great City, and shall rejoice over them, and make merry, and send Gifts one to another.</hi> But the Issue of that great and last Battle is quite the Reverse; it is the Church's Triumph over her Enemies, as being utterly and forever destroyed.</p>
            <p>Here if any one shall say, That the Ascension of the Witnesses into Heaven in the Sight of their Enemies, may, as has more generally been supposed, signify the Church's last Victory and Triumph over her antichris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Enemies, and final Deliverance from them, and yet the Battle between Antichrist and the Witnesses, spoken of <hi>Rev.</hi> xi.7. wherein the Witnesses are slain, may not be the same with that last and greatest Battle between Antichrist and the Church, Chap. xvi. and xix. that immediately preceeds and issues in the Church's final Victory and Deliverance; there may be two great Battles, soon following one another, tho' both are not mentioned in the same Place; one a Conflict, wherein Antichrist prevails against the Witnesses, and overcomes them, and kills them, and another that great Battle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed Chap. xvi. and xix. after the Witnesses Resur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection, before their Ascension into Heaven, wherein they shall prevail and overcome their Enemies, and kill them: I say, if any one shall say thus, they will say that which the Prophecies give no Reason, nor allow any Room to suppose. That last Battle between the Church and Antichrist, wherein Christ and his People obtain a compleat Victory, is evidently one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>test
<pb n="116" facs="unknown:005938_0124_0000000000000000"/>
and most remarkable Events foretold in all the <hi>Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calypse</hi>: And there is no one Thing, unless it be the Consummation of all Things, in the two last Chapters, that is described in so solemn and august a Manner. And the Description shews that it is an Event which with its Circumstances must take up much Time. There is vast Preparation made for it by the Church's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: The Devils, in order to stir Men up, and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther them together, to this <hi>Battle of that great Day of God Almighty, go forth unto the Kings of the Earth and of the whole World,</hi> to propagate various Kinds of Delu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions, far and wide, all over the World; which undoub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tedly must take up many Years Time; Chap. xvi.13, 14. And then great Preparation is made in the Church of God, to make Opposition; Chap. xix.11,—17. Now can any reasonably suppose, t<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t in what is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented, Chap. xi. of a great Conflict between Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ and God's People, wherein the Latter are over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come and slain, and lie dead three Days (or three Years) and an half, and their Enemies triumphing over them, but God's People rising again from the Dead in the midst of this Triumph of their Enemies, and ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding into Heaven, while their Enemies stand astonished and amazed Spectators,— that the Manner of the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scription leaves fair Room for us to suppose, that after this Resurrection of God's People, they continue long before they ascend, to encounter with Antichrist in a new Conflict, wherein their Enemies, after long Time to prepare, should engage with them with vastly greater Preparation, Strength, and Violence than before, and should wage War with them with the mightiest Army that ever was gathered against the Church, and in the greatest Battle that ever was fought?</p>

               <pb n="117" facs="unknown:005938_0125_0000000000000000"/>And besides, the Witnesses ascending into Heaven in the Sight of their Enemies, spoken of Chap. xi. cannot be the same with the Church's gaining a glorious As<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cendant over her Enemies, in her final Victory over Antichrist, spoken of Chap. xvi. and xix. because the Descriptions of the Events that attend the one and the other do by no Means answer each other. For, ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve, 'tis said, that when the Witnesses <hi>arose, and stood on their Feet, and ascended into Heaven, the same Hour there was a great Earthquake</hi>: But this don't seem to answer to what is described Chap. xvi.18. <hi>And there were Voices, and Thunders, and Lightnings, and there was a great Earthquake, such as was not since Men were upon the Earth, so mighty an Earthquake, and so great.</hi> 'Tis said that at the Time of the first Earthquake, Chap. xi.13. <hi>The tenth Part of the City fell</hi>: But how far does this fall short of what is described, as attending the great Earthquake? Chap. xvi.19, 20. <hi>And the great City was divided into three Parts, and the Cities of the Nations fell; and great</hi> Babylon <hi>came into Remembrance before God, to give unto her the Cup of the Wine of the Fierceness of his Wrath; and every Island fled away, and the Mountains were not found.</hi> 'Tis said of the Earthquake, Chap. xi. <hi>And in the Earthquake were slain of Men Seven Thousand</hi>: But how far is this from answering the Slaughter de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed Chap. xix.17, &amp;c.? Which is represented as a general Slaughter of the Kings, Captains, mighty Men, Horses and Armies of the Earth and of the whole World; so that all the Fowls that fly in the midst of Heaven, as far as the Sun shines, are filled with the Flesh of the dead Carcases, it being the <hi>Flesh of all Men, both free and bond, both small and great</hi>: (Compare Chap. xvi.14.) Who can think, that this great Slaughter that
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:005938_0126_0000000000000000"/>
is thus represented, should in Chap. xi. be only called a <hi>slaying seven thousand Men</hi>?</p>
            <p>If we read this very eleventh Chapter through, we shall see that the falling of the tenth Part of the City, and the Witnesses rising and ascending into Heaven, are entirely distinct from the final Destruction of Antichrist, and that Advancement of the Church to her latter-day Glory, that is consequent upon it. The Judgments here spoken of, as executed on God's Enemi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

And then in the last Verse, we have a brief Hint of that same Earthquake, and that great Hail, and those Thunders and Lightnings and Voices, that we have an Account of in the latter Part of Chap. xvi. So that the Earthquake mention'd in the last Verse of Chap. xi. is that great Earthquake that attends the last great Conflict of the Church and her Enemies; and not that mention'd Ver. 13.</p>
            <p>The <hi>three Woes</hi> are the Woes of God on Antichrist and his Subjects; and the third and last of them evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently signifies the terrible Judgments of God on An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,

by which God's Wrath upon him shall be ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fill'd in his utter Destruction: But the Calamities on Antichrist, spoken of as attending the rising and ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the Witnesses, such as the falling of the tenth Part of the City, and slaying seven thousand Men, do not belong to this <hi>last Woe,</hi> and therefore don't signify the final Destruction of Antichrist: For the Words of Ver. 14. will by no Means allow of such a Supposition; for there, immediately after giving an Account of these Calamities, it is added, <hi>The second Wo is past; and behold the third Wo cometh quickly</hi>: Making a most plain and express Distinction between these Calamities that had already been mention'd, and especially these that were just then mention'd in the very last Words, and the Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lamities that belong to the <hi>third Wo,</hi> that yet remain to be mention'd: For by being pass'd, the Prophet is to be understood no otherwise than pass'd in the Declara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Representation; it was not past in any other Respect: 'Tis as much as to say, Thus an Account has been given of the Calamities upon Antichrist that belong to the second Woe; now I proceed to give an Account of those Dispensations of Providence that belong to the third and last Wo, which shall prove Antichrist's final Destruction, and end in the Kingdoms of this World becoming the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ.</p>
            <p>What was fulfill'd in the <hi>Reformation,</hi> well answers the Representation made concerning the Witnesses, Rev. xi.11, 12. Of <hi>the Spirit of Life from God entring into them, and their standing on their Feet, and ascending up to Heaven, in the Sight of their Enemies.</hi> A little be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Reformation, the State of the Church of God, and of true Religion was lowest of all, and nearest to utter Extinction.

Struggles, prevailed against the <hi>Waldenses, Albigenses</hi> and <hi>Bohemians.</hi> The War with the <hi>Albigenses</hi> seems especially to be intended by the War of the Beast with the Witnesses spoken of <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. These were Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nesses to the Truth, that were the most numerous and considerable, and those that most tormented the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> And the War that was maintain'd against them, was by far the greatest that ever Antichrist had a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst any of the Professors of the Truth, before the Reformation; and was properly the War of the Beast; It was the Pope that proclaim'd the War, and that rai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the Soldiers by his Emissaries and Priests, preaching the Cross, gathering innumerable Multitudes of Pilgrims from all Parts of <hi>Christendom,</hi> and raising one Croisade after another, which were conducted and managed by the Pope's Legates; and it was the Pope that paid the Soldiers with Pardo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Indulgences, Promises of Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise, and such-like Trumpery. When Antichrist had gradually prevailed against these Witnesses, with much Difficulty, and long-continued violent Struggling, and after innumerable vexatious Disasters and Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; The Church of God, in the Time of <hi>Luther</hi> and other Reformers, on a Sudden, in a wonderful Manner revives, when such an Event was least expec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, (to the Surprize and Amazement of their antichristian Enemies) and appears in such Strength, that the Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med are able to stand on their own Legs, and to with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stand all the Power and Rage of the Church of <hi>Rome.</hi> Presently after this Revival, the People of God are set on high, having the Civil Magistrate in many Countries on their Side, and henceforward have the Power of ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny potent Princes engaged for their Protection: And this, in Sight of their Enemies, and greatly to their

Grief and Vexation; who, tho' they from Time to Time exert their utmost, never are able to prevail a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst them, to bring them under any more, as they had done in former Wars. Oftentimes in Scripture, God's Church's dwelling in Safety, out of the Reach of their Enemies, is represented by their <hi>dwelling on high,</hi> or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>set on high</hi>; as <hi>Psal.</hi> lix.1. lxix.29. xci.14. cvii.41. <hi>Prov.</hi> xxix.25. <hi>Isai.</hi> xxxiii.16. The Children of <hi>Israel,</hi> in their Deliverance out of <hi>Egypt,</hi> from their cruel Task-Masters, that would fain have brought 'em into Bondage again, were said to <hi>be carried on Eagle's Wings,</hi> that is loftly in it's Flight, flies away towards Heaven; so that the <hi>Egyptians</hi> could not come at them: And they were protected by the Cloud that went with them; as the Witnesses are said to be caught up to Heaven in a Cloud. Compare this with Isai. iv.5. <hi>And the Lord will create upon every Dwelling-Place of Mount</hi> Zion, <hi>and upon her Assemblies, a Cloud and Smoke by Day, and the shining of the flaming Fire by Night; for upon all the Glory shall be a Defence.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I shall not pretend to explain the Mystery of the <hi>three Days and half</hi> of the Witnesses lying dead, or to deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine the precise Duration signified by that mystical Representation. Possibly no particular Measure of Time may be intended by it; and yet it not be with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Significancy. <note n="†" place="bottom">Mr. <hi>Lowman,</hi> in the Preface to his Paraphrase on the Revelation, Page 8. observes as follows;
<q>Prophetick Numbers do not always express a determinate Duration or Space of Time, any more than they always express certain Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber. Prophecy, I acknowledge, uses Numbers sometimes as other Expressions, in a figurative Meaning, as Symbols and Hieroglyphicks. Thus the Number <hi>Seven,</hi> sometimes does not denote the precise Number Seven: but figura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively denotes Perfection, or a full and compleat Number: And the Number <hi>Ten,</hi> sometimes does not mean precisely Ten in Number, but many in general, or a considerable Number.</q>
               </note> As no particular Number of Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons
<pb n="122" facs="unknown:005938_0130_0000000000000000"/>
is intended by the <hi>two</hi> Witnesses; but in general, it intends a small Number, and yet a sufficient Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber; and as small as might be, and yet be sufficient; as, less than two Witnesses was not sufficient: So per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps no particular Duration of that low State that the Church was in before the Reformation, may be intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by three Days and half; but in general it may be hereby signified, that this Time of the triumphing of the Wicked, and Extremity of God's Church, should be but short. And possibly three Days and half may be mentioned, because that is the utmost Space of Time that a dead Body can be ordinarily supposed to lie with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Putrefaction; signifying that at this Time the Church should be brought to the very Brink of utter Ruin, and yet should be preserved and revive again. And half a Day may be mention'd to signify the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular Care of Providence in exactly determining this Time of his Church's Extremity. And probably there may be some Reference to the three Times (or three Years) and an Half of the Witnesses prophesying in Sackcloth; the more apparently to shew the Dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion between the Time of the Church's Welfare,
<pb n="123" facs="unknown:005938_0131_0000000000000000"/>
and the Time of her Enemies Victory and Triumph: The Time of the Church's Affliction and Conflict may be long; and in the Issue she may be overcome; but the Time of this Victory shall be but short; in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison with the other, but as a Day to a Year: She may as it were be kill'd, and lie dead, 'till she comes to the very Brink of utter and hopeless Ruin, but yet God will not suffer her to see Corruption; but at that very Time, when her Enemies expected that she should pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trify, she shall rise; and be set on high, out of their Reach, greatly to their Astonishment.</p>
            <p>The grand Objection against all this, is, that it is said that <hi>the Witnesses should prophesy</hi> twelve hundred and sixty <hi>Days cloathed in Sackcloth; and when they have finished their Testimony, the Beast should make War against them and kill them,</hi> &amp;c. and that it seems mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fest, that after this, they are no longer in Sackcloth, for henceforward they are in an exalted State in Heaven: And that therefore, seeing the Time of their wear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sackcloth, is <hi>twelve hundred and sixty</hi> Days, which is the Time of the Continuance of Antichrist; hence their being slain and rising again, must be at the Conclusion of this Period, and so at the End of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ's Reign.</p>
            <p>In answer to which I would say, that we can justly infer no more from this Prophecy than this, <hi>viz.</hi> That the <hi>twelve hundred and sixty</hi> Days is the <hi>proper Time</hi> of the Church's Trouble and Bondage, or being cloathed in Sackcloth; because it is the <hi>appointed Time</hi> of the Reign of Antichrist. But this don't hinder but that God, out of his great Compassion to his Church, should, in some Respect, shorten the Days, and grant that she should, in some Measure, anticipate the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed
<pb n="124" facs="unknown:005938_0132_0000000000000000"/>
great Deliverance that should be at the End of those Days. As he has in Fact done in the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; whereby the Church has had a great Degree of Restoration granted, from the Darkness and Power of Antichrist, before her proper Time of Restoration, which is at the End of the <hi>twelve hundred and sixty</hi> Days. Thus the Church of Christ, through the tender Mercies of her Father and Redeemer, in some Respects, anticipates her Deliverance from her Sorrows and Sackcloth: As many Parts of the Church are here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by brought from under the Dominion of the antichris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Powers, into a State of Power and Liberty; tho' in other Respects, the Church may be said to continue in Sackcloth, and in the Wilderness, 'till the End of Days; many Parts of it still remaining under grievous Persecution.</p>
            <p>What we render, <hi>When they shall have finished their Testimony,</hi> Mr. <hi>Lowman,</hi> from Mr. <hi>Daubuz,</hi> renders, <hi>While they shall perform their Testimony</hi>; and observes, that the Original may mean the Time of their Testi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, as well as the End of it.</p>
            <p>I might here observe that we have other Instances of God's shortening the Days of his Church's Captivity and Bondage, either at the Beginning or End, very pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel with what has been now supposed in the Case of the Witnesses. Thus the proper Time of the Bondage of the Posterity of <hi>Abraham</hi> in <hi>Egypt,</hi> was <hi>four hundred</hi> Years; <hi>Gen.</hi> xv.13. But yet God in Mercy defer'd the Beginning of their Bondage; whereby the Time was much shorten'd at the Beginning. So the Time wherein it was foretold that the <hi>whole Land of</hi> Israel <hi>should be a Desolation and an Astonishment, and the Land should enjoy her Sabbaths,</hi> by the <hi>Babylonish</hi> Captivity, was
<pb n="125" facs="unknown:005938_0133_0000000000000000"/>
               <hi>seventy Years</hi>; Jer. xxv.11, 12. and these seventy Years are dated in 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> xxxvi.20, 21. from <hi>Zede<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kiah</hi>'s Captivity; and yet, from that Captivity to <hi>Cy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rus</hi>'s Decree, was but <hi>fifty two</hi> Years; tho' it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed <hi>seventy</hi> Years before the more full Restoration of the Jewish Church and State by <hi>Darius</hi>'s Decree, <hi>Ezra</hi> vi. So the proper Time of the Oppression and Bondage of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church under <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in <hi>both the Sanctuary and Host should be trodden under Foot by him,</hi> was <hi>two thousand three hundred</hi> Days; <hi>Dan.</hi> viii.13, 14. The Time from <hi>Antiochus</hi>'s taking <hi>Ierusalem</hi> and polluting the Sanctuary, to <hi>Antiochus</hi>'s Death, seems to have been about so long: But God shorten'd the Days, by granting remarkable Help to his People by Means of the <hi>Maccabees,</hi> before that Time: Yea the Temple and Sanctuary were restored, and the Altar rebuilt and dedicated before that Time.</p>
            <p>Upon the whole, I think there appears to be no Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son from the Prophecy concerning the <hi>two Witnesses, Rev.</hi> xi. to expect any such general and terrible <hi>De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>struction</hi> of the Church of Christ, before the utter Down<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fall of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> as some have supposed; but good Reason to determine the contrary. 'Tis true, there is abundant Evidence in Scripture, that there is yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining a mighty Conflict between the Church and her Enemies, the most violent Struggle of <hi>Satan</hi> and his Adherents, in Opposition to true Religion, and the most general C<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>mmotion that ever was in the World, since the Foundation of it to that Time; and many particular Christians, and some Parts of the Church of Christ, may suffer hard Things in this Conflict: But in the general, <hi>Satan</hi> and <hi>Antichrist</hi> shall not get the Vic<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, nor greatly prevail; but on the contrary be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tirely
<pb n="126" facs="unknown:005938_0134_0000000000000000"/>
conquered, and utterly overthrown, in this great Battle. So that I hope this Prophecy of the slaying of the Witnesses, will not stand in the Way of a Compli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance with the Proposal made to us in the <hi>Memorial,</hi> as a prevalent Objection and Discouragement.</p>
            <p>OBJECT. 5. A late very learned and ingenious Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positor of the <hi>Revelation, viz.</hi> Mr. <hi>Lowman,</hi> sets the Fall of <hi>Antichrist,</hi> and consequently the Coming of Christ's Kingdom, at a great <hi>Distance</hi>; supposing that the <hi>twelve hundred and sixty</hi> Years of Antichrist's Reign did not begin 'till the Year <hi>seven hundred and fifty six</hi>; and consequently that it will not end 'till after the the Year <hi>Two Thousand,</hi> more than <hi>two hundred and fif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty</hi> Years hence; and this Opinion he confirms by a great Variety of Arguments.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. If this Objection be allowed to be valid, and that which ought to determine Persons in an Affair of this Nature, and those Things, concerning God's People praying for this glorious Event, be also allowed to be true, which before were shewn to be the Will of God abundantly revealed in his Word, then the follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Things must be supposed; <hi>viz.</hi> That 'tis the Will of God that his People be much in Prayer for this Event, and particularly that it is God's revealed Will and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that, a little before the Accomplishment of it, his People be earnestly seeking and waiting, and importu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately and incessantly crying to God for it; But yet that it was God's Design, that before this Time comes of extraordinary Prayer and Importunity of his Church, for the bringing on this glorious Event, his Church should have it given 'em to understand precisely when the appointed Time should be; and that accordingly
<pb n="127" facs="unknown:005938_0135_0000000000000000"/>
he has now actually brought the fix'd Time to Light, by means of Mr. <hi>Lowman.</hi> But is it reasonable to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose, that this should be God's Manner of dealing with his Church, first to make known to them the precise Time which he has unalterably fix'd for the shewing this Mercy to <hi>Zion,</hi> and then make it the Duty of his Church, in an extraordinary Manner, to be by Prayer enquiring of him concerning it, and saying, <hi>How long, Lord!</hi> and waiting for it, Day and Night crying to him with exceeding Importunity that he would bring it on, that he would come quickly, that he would hide him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self no longer, but would arise and have Mercy upon <hi>Zion,</hi> and awake as one out of Sleep, openly manifest himself, and make bare his holy Arm for the Salvation of his People? That <hi>they that make mention of the Lord should not keep Silence, nor give him any Rest, 'till he esta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blish, and make</hi> Jerusalem <hi>a Praise in the Earth?</hi> And that the Church should then say to Christ, <hi>Make haste, my Beloved, and be thou like a R<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

            </p>
            <p>It may be many Ways for the Comfort and Benefit of God's Church in her afflicted State, to know that the Reign of Antichrist is to be no more than 1260 Years: And some Things in general may be argued concerning the Approach of it, when it is near: As <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

               </gap> But 'tis not reasonable to expect that God should make known to us beforehand, the precise Time of Christ's Coming in his Kingdom. The Disciples desired to know this, and manifested their Desire to their Lord; but he told 'em plainly that <hi>it was not for them to know
<pb n="128" facs="unknown:005938_0136_0000000000000000"/>
the Times and Seasons, which the Father hath put in his own Power</hi>; (Acts i.6, 7.) and there is no Reason to think that it is any more for us than for them; or for Christ's Disciples in these Days any more than for his Apostles in those Days. God makes it the Duty of his Church to be importunately praying for it, and pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that it may come <hi>speedily</hi>; and not only to be pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing for it, but to be seeking of it, in the Use of proper Means; endeavouring that Religion may now revive every where, and <hi>Satan</hi>'s Kingdom be overthrown; and always to be waiting for it, being in a constant Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration for it, as Servants that wait for the Coming of their Lord, or Virgins for the Coming of the Bride<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>groom, not knowing at what Hour he will come. But God's making known beforehand the precise Time of his Coming, don't well consist with these Things.</p>
            <p>It is the revealed Will of God, that he should be en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired of by his People, by extraordinary Prayer, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this great Mercy, to do it for them, before it be fulfilled. And if any suppose, that 'tis now found out precisely when the Time is to be, and (the Time being at a considerable Distance) that now is not a proper Season to begin this extraordinary Prayer, I would, on this Supposition, ask, When we shall begin? <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <hi>Ans.</hi> 2. I acknowledge that Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi>'s Exposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the <hi>Revelation</hi> is, on many Accounts, excellently written, giving great Light into some Parts of that Prophecy, and an Instance of the Fulfilment of that Prediction, Dan. xii.4.—<hi>Many shall run to and fro, and Knowledge shall be encreased</hi>: And especially in his In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretation of the five first Vials (which he supposeth already poured out) exceeding satisfying. But yet the Opinion of Mr. <hi>Lowman,</hi> with Regard to the particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar Time of the Beginning and End of the Time, Times and an half of Antichrist's Reign, and of all others that pretend to fix the Time, is the less to be regarded, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause 'tis clearly revealed, and expressly declared by God, that that Matter should be sealed up and hid, and not known 'till <hi>the Time of the End</hi> of this Time, Times and an Half. <hi>Daniel,</hi> in the last Chapter of his Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, gives us an Account, how the Angel told him of a future Time of great Trouble and Affliction to the Church of God, and then said to him, Ver. 4. <hi>But Thou, O Daniel,</hi> SHUT UP THE WORDS, AND SEAL THE BOOK, EVEN TO THE TIME OF THE END. And then the Prophet proceeds to give an Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count of a Vision that he had of one earnestly enquiring of the Angel of the Lord <hi>how long it would be to the End</hi> of this remarkable and wonderful Time of the Church's Trouble, saying, <hi>How long shall it be to the End of these Wonders?</hi> Ver. 5, 6. The Answer was, that <hi>it should be for a Time, Times and an Half,</hi> and that when so long a Time was past, then this wonderful Affliction and Scattering of the holy People should be finished, Ver. 7. But then <hi>Daniel</hi> tells us, in the next Verse, that <hi>he heard, but he understood not,</hi> and said, <hi>O my Lord, what shall be the End of these Things?</hi> He did
<pb n="130" facs="unknown:005938_0138_0000000000000000"/>
not understand that general and mystical Answer, that those Things should have an End at the End of a Time, Times and an half; he did not know by it, when this Period would have an End: And therefore he enquires more particularly what the Time of the End was. But the Angel replies, Ver. 9. <hi>Go thy Way,</hi> Daniel, <hi>the Words are closed and sealed up, 'till the Time of the End.</hi> I don't know what could have been more express. The Angel gently rebukes this Over-Inquisitiveness of <hi>Daniel,</hi> very much as Christ did a like Inquisitiveness of the Disciples concerning the same Matter, when he said to 'em, <hi>'Tis not for you to know the Times and Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons, that the Father hath put in his own Power.</hi>—I think there can be no doubt but that this Space, of a Time, Times and Half of the Church's great Trouble, about the End of which <hi>Daniel</hi> enquires, is the same with that Time, Times and Half, that is spoken of Chap. vii.25. and <hi>Rev.</hi> xii.14. as the Time of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ's Reign, and the Church's being in the Wilder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness; and not meerly the Time of the Church's Trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles by <hi>Antiochus Epiphanes.</hi> But we see, when <hi>Daniel</hi> has a mind to know particularly when this Time would come to an End, he is bid to go away, and rest con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented in Ignorance of this Matter: For, says the Man cloathed in Linnen, THE WORDS ARE CLOSED UP, AND SEALED, 'TILL THE TIME OF THE END. That is, very plainly, the Matter that you en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire about, when the End of this Time, and Times and Half shall come, shall not be known, but kept a great Secret, 'till the Time of the End actually comes, and all Attempts to find it out before that shall be in vain. And therefore when a particular Divine appears, that thinks he has found it out, and has unsealed this
<pb n="131" facs="unknown:005938_0139_0000000000000000"/>
Matter, and made it manifest with very manifold and abundant Evidence, we may well think he is mistaken, and doubt whether those supposed Evidences are truly solid ones, and such as are indeed sufficient to make that Matter manifest, which God has declared should be kept hid, and not made manifest before 'tis accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished. Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi>'s own Words in his Preface, p. 24, 25. are here worthy to be repeated:
<q>It will (says he) ever be a Point of Wisdom, not to be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver-busy, or over-confident in any Thing, especially in fixing Periods of Time, or determining Seasons; which it may be are not to be determined, it may be are not fit to be known. It is a Maxim, of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Wisdom than is usually thought, <hi>Seek not to know what should not be revealed.</hi> Such are many future Events. The precise Time of our Saviour's coming to Judgment, was not revealed, because not fit to be revealed. The Uncertainty of his Appearance was of greater Service to preserve a Care of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, than the Revelation of it would have been: For the Uncertainty itself gives many useful Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations; <hi>Watch, for ye know not what Hour the Son of Man cometh.</hi> Suppose then some of the Events described in this Prophecy should be of doubtful Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication, suppose the precise Time of the Downfall of the Beast, the Slaying and Resurrection of the Witnesses, and the Beginning of the thousand Years happy State of the Church, should not be so deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined, but it would admit of different Calculations; may it not be wise, and therefore fit, it should be so? The Certainty of those Events in a proper Time, tho' that Time should not be precisely determined, will answer the greater Ends of useful Instruction.
<pb n="132" facs="unknown:005938_0140_0000000000000000"/>
And if the Revelation should go no further than this, it would yet be a Revelation, of great Benefit and Advantage; as the Certainty of the Day of Judgment in its proper Time surely is, tho' of that Day and Hour knoweth no Man.</q>

               </gap> I humbly conceive that we have no Reason to suppose the Event princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pally intended in the Prophecies of Antichrist's Destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be at so great a <hi>Distance,</hi> as Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> places it; but have reason to think it to be much nearer. Not that I would set up my self as a Person of equal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> in Matters of this Nature. As he differs from most others of the most approved Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positors of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> in this Matter, so I hope it will not appear Vanity and Presumption in me, to differ from this particular Expositor, and to agree with the greater Number. And since his Opinion stands so much in the Way of that great and important Affair, to promote which is the very End of this whole Dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>course, I hope it will not look as tho' I affected to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear considerable among the Interpreters of Prophecy, and as a Person of Skill in these mysterious Matters, that I offer some Reasons against Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi>'s Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion. 'Tis surely great Pity, that it should be received as a Thing clear and abundantly confirmed, that the glorious Day of Antichrist's Fall is at so great a Distance (so directly tending to damp and discourage all earnest Prayers for, or Endeavours after its speedy Accomplish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment) unless there be good and plain Ground for it. I would therefore offer some Things to Consideration, which I think may justly make us look upon the Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of this learned Interpreter, of this happy Event's
<pb n="133" facs="unknown:005938_0141_0000000000000000"/>
being at so great a Distance, not so certain and indubi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table, as to hinder our praying and hoping for its be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fulfilled much sooner.</p>
            <p>The Period of Antichrist's Reign, as this Author has fixed it, seems to be the main Point insisted on in his Exposition of the Revelation; which he supposes a great many Things in the Scheme of Prophecies deli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered in that Book do concur to establish. And indeed it is so, with Respect to the Scheme of Interpretation of these Prophecies, which he goes into, and finds it requisite to maintain, in order to confirm this Point. But there are several Things in that Scheme, that ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear to me justly liable to Exception.</p>
            <p>Whereas 'tis represented, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii.10, 11. that there are seven different successive Heads of the Beast; that five were past, and another was to come, and to continue a short Space, that might on some Accounts be reckon'd a seventh; and that Antichrist was to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low next after this, as the eighth; but yet the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing not being properly one of the Heads of the Beast, he was properly the seventh; Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> don't think with others, that by the seventh that was to continue a short Space, which would not be properly one of the Heads of the Beast, is meant <hi>Constantine</hi> and the other Christian Emperors; (for he thinks they are reckon'd as properly belonging to the sixth Head of the Beast) but that hereby is intended the Government that <hi>Rome</hi> was subject to under the <hi>Gothick</hi> Princes, and the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>archate of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> after the Imperial Form of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in <hi>Rome</hi> ceased in <hi>Augustulus,</hi> 'till the Pope was invested with his temporal Dominion, called St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Patrimony, by <hi>Pipin</hi> King of <hi>France,</hi> in the Year 756. And he supposes, that that wounding of one of the Heads
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:005938_0142_0000000000000000"/>
of the Beast with a Sword unto Death, that we read of <hi>Chap.</hi> xiii.3, and 14. was not fulfilled in the Destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Heathen Empire, and the giving the Imperial Power unto Christians, but in the Destruction of the Imperial Form of Government, by the Sword of the <hi>Goths,</hi> in the Time of <hi>Augustulus.</hi> But it seems to me to be very unlikely, that the Spirit of God should reckon <hi>Constantine</hi> and the Christian Emperors as proper Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and belonging to one of the Heads, of that mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>strous wild and cruel Beast, that is compared to a Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pard and a Bear, and a devouring Lion, and that had a Mouth speaking great Things and Blasphemies, and that rules by the Power and Authority of the Dragon, or the Devil; <note n="†" place="bottom">The Word <hi>Therion</hi> signifies a wild savage Beast, as Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> himself observes, Page 127.</note> which Beast is represented in this very 17th Chap. as full of Names of Blasphemy, and of a bloody Colour, denoting his exceeding Cruelty in persecuting the christian Church. For <hi>Constantine,</hi> instead of this, was a Member of the christian Church, and set by God in the most eminent Station in his Church; and was honoured, above all other Princes that ever had been in the World, as the great Protector of his Church, and her Deliverer from the persecuting Power of that cruel scarlet-coloured Beast. Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> himself styles him <hi>a christian Prince, and Protector of the christian Religion.</hi> God is very careful not to reckon his own People among the Gentiles, the visible Subjects of <hi>Satan</hi>; Num. xxiii.9. <hi>The People shall not be reckon'd among the Nations.</hi> God won't enroll them with them; if they happen to be a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong them, he will be careful to set a Mark upon
<pb n="135" facs="unknown:005938_0143_0000000000000000"/>
them, as a Note of Distinction; <hi>Rev.</hi> vii.3. &amp;c. when God is reckoning up his own People, he leaves out those that have been noted for Idolatry. As among the Tribes that were sealed <hi>Rev.</hi> viii. those idolatrous Tribes of <hi>Ephraim</hi> and <hi>Dan</hi> are left out, and in the Genealogy of Christ, <hi>Matth.</hi> i. those Princes that were chiefly noted for Idolatry, are left out. Much more would God be careful not to reckon his own People, especially such christian Princes as have been the most eminent Instruments of overthrowing Idolatry, amongst Idolaters, and as Members and Heads of that Kingdom that is noted in Scripture as the most no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious and infamous of all, for abominable Idolatry, and Opposition and Cruelty to the true Worshippers of God. And especially not to reckon them as properly belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to one of those seven Heads of this Monarchy, of which very Heads it is particularly noted that they had on them the Names of <hi>Blasphemy</hi>; (Rev. xiii.1.) which Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> himself supposes to signify <hi>Idolatry.</hi> It was therefore worthy of God, agreable to his Manner, and what might well be expected, that when he was reckon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> the several successive Heads of this Beast, and <hi>Constantine</hi> and his Successors came in the Way, and there was Occasion to mention them, to set a Mark, or Note of Distinction on them, signifying that they did not properly belong to the Beast, nor were to be rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>koned as belonging to his Heads; and therefore are to be skip'd over in the Reckoning; and Antichrist, tho' the eighth Head of the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire, is to be reckoned the seventh Head of the Beast. This appears to me abundantly the most just and natural Interpretation of <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii.10, 11. 'Tis reasonable to suppose, that God would take Care to make such a Note in this prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tical Description of this dreadful Beast, and not by any
<pb n="136" facs="unknown:005938_0144_0000000000000000"/>
Means to reckon <hi>Constantine</hi> as belonging properly to him.—If we reckon <hi>Constantine</hi> as a Member of this Beast having seven Heads and ten Horns, described Chap. xvii. and as properly one of his Heads, then he was also properly a Member of the great red Dragon with seven Heads and ten Horns, that warred with the Woman, Chap. xii.—For the seven Heads and ten Horns of that Dragon, are plainly the same with the seven Heads and ten Horns of this Beast. So that this makes <hi>Constantine</hi> a visible Member of the Devil: For we are told expresly of that Dragon, Ver. 9. that he was <hi>that old Serpent, called the Devil and Satan.</hi> And to suppose that <hi>Constantine</hi> is reckon'd as belonging to one of the Heads of that Dragon, is to make these Prophecies inconsistent with themselves. For here in this 12th Chap. we have represented a War between the Dragon and the Woman clothed in the Sun; which Woman, as all agree, is the Church: but <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine,</hi> as all do also agree, belong'd to the Woman, was a Member of the Christian Church, and was on that Side in the War against the Dragon, yea, was the main Instrument of that great Victory that was obtain'd over the Dragon there spoken of, Ver. 9,—12. What an Inconsistency therefore is it, to suppose that he was at the same Time a Member and Head of that very Dra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gon, which fought with the Woman, and yet which <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stantine</hi> himself fought with, overcame, and gloriously triumphed over! 'Tis not therefore to be wondered at, that God was careful to distinguish <hi>Constantine</hi> from the proper Heads of the Beast: It would have been a Wonder if he had not. God seems to have been careful to distinguish him, not only in his Word, but in his Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, by so ordering it that this Christian Emperor
<pb n="137" facs="unknown:005938_0145_0000000000000000"/>
should be removed from <hi>Rome,</hi> the City that God had given up to be the Seat of the Power of the Beast and of its Heads, and that he should have the Seat of his Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pire elsewhere.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Constantine</hi> was made the Instrument of giving a mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Wound to the Heathen Roman Empire; and giving it a mortal Wound in its Head, <hi>viz.</hi> the Heathen Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perors that were then reigning, <hi>Maxentius</hi> and <hi>Licinius.</hi> But more eminently was this glorious Change in the Empire owing to the Power of God's Word, the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valence of the glorious Gospel, by which <hi>Constantine</hi> himself was converted, and so became the Instrument of the Overthrow of Heathen Empire in the East and West. The Change that was then brought to pass, is represented as the Destruction of the Heathen Empire, or the old Heathen World; and therefore seems to be compared to that Dissolution of Heaven and Earth that shall be at the Day of Judgment, Rev. vi.12, to the End. And therefore well might the Heathen Empire under the Head which was then reigning, be represented as wounded to Death, Chap. xiii.3. 'Tis much more likely, that the Wound the Beast had by a Sword, in his Head, spoken of Ver. 14. was the Wound that the Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>then Empire had in its Head, by that Sword that we read of <hi>Chap.</hi> i.16. and xix.15. that proceeds out of the Mouth of Christ, than the Wound that was given to the <hi>Christian</hi> Empire and Emperor by the Sword of the Heathen <hi>Goths.</hi> 'Tis most likely that this deadly Wound was by that Sword with which <hi>Michael</hi> made War with him and overcame him and cast him to the Earth, <hi>Chap.</hi> xii.9. and that the deadly Wound that was given him, was given him at that very Time. 'Tis most likely, that the Sword that gave him this deadly
<pb n="138" facs="unknown:005938_0146_0000000000000000"/>
Wound, after which he strangely revived, as tho' he rose from the Dead, was the same Sword with that which is spoken of, as what shall at last utterly destroy him, so that he shall never rise more, <hi>Chap.</hi> xix.15, 19, 20.21. This wounding of the Head of the Beast by the Destruction of the Heathen Empire, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>version of the Emperor to the Christian Truth, was a glorious Event indeed of divine Providence, worthy to be so much spoken of in Prophecy.—'Tis natural to suppose, that the mortal wounding of the Head of that savage cruel Beast, that is represented as constantly at War with the Woman, and persecuting the Church of Christ, should be some Relief to the Christian Church: But on the contrary, that wounding to Death that Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> speaks of, was the Victory of the Enemies of the Christian Church <hi>over her,</hi> and the Wound she re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived <hi>from them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis said of that Head of the Empire that shall be next after the sixth Head, and next before Antichrist, and that is not reckon'd as properly one of the Number of the Heads of the Beast, that <hi>when it comes, it shall continue a short Space,</hi> Chap. xvii.10. By which we may well understand, at least, that it shall be one of the shortest in it's Continuance, of the successive Heads. But the Government seated at <hi>Ravenna,</hi> in the Hands of the <hi>Goths,</hi> or of the Deputies of the <hi>Greek</hi> Emperors, (which Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> supposes to be meant by this Head) continued, as Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> himself takes Notice, very near 300 Years. And if so, it's Continuance was one of the longest of the Heads mention'd.</p>
            <p>And besides if the Government that <hi>Rome</hi> was under, from the Time that <hi>Augustulus</hi> abdicated, to the Time when the Pope was confirmed in his temporal Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion,
<pb n="139" facs="unknown:005938_0147_0000000000000000"/>
was meant by that seventh Head that was to be between the Imperial Head and the Papal, there would doubtless have been two different Heads mention'd, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stead of one, between the Emperor and the Pope; <hi>viz.</hi> First, the <hi>Gothick</hi> Princes, which reigned near an 100 Years; Secondly, the <hi>Exarchs</hi> of <hi>Ravenna,</hi> which go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verned for about 185 Years. The <hi>Gothick</hi> Kingdom was much more properly a distinct Government from the Imperial, than the Exarchate of <hi>Ravenna.</hi> For du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring the Exarchate, <hi>Rome</hi> was under the Government of the Emperor, as much as it was in <hi>Constantine</hi>'s Time.</p>
            <p>In <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii.12. 'tis said, the <hi>ten Horns are ten Kings, which are to receive Power as Kings one Hour with the Beast,</hi> or (as Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> says it ought to have been translated) <hi>the same Hour</hi> or <hi>Point of Time with the Beast.</hi> This will not allow the Time when Antichrist first receives Power as King, to be so late as Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> supposes. This Division of the Empire into many Kingdoms, denoted by the Number <hi>Ten,</hi> was about the Year 456, after <hi>Gensericus</hi> had taken the City of <hi>Rome</hi>: But Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> places the Beginning of the Reign of Antichrist in the Year 756, which is 300 Years later. I know, such an Expression as <hi>in one Hour,</hi> or <hi>the same Hour,</hi> may allow some Latitude; but surely not such a Latitude as this. This is a much longer Time, than it was from the Time of the Vision to <hi>Constantine</hi>; mu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap>h longer than the Space of all the first six Seals; longer than it was from Christ's Ascen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion to <hi>Constantine</hi>; and near as long as the Time of all the Reigns of the Heathen Emperors put together, from <hi>Augustus Caesar</hi> to <hi>Constantine.</hi> An Hour is every where, in the other Place in this Book of Revelation,
<pb n="140" facs="unknown:005938_0148_0000000000000000"/>

Rev. xi.13.</note> The Phrase <hi>one Hour</hi> is used several Times in the next Chapter, speaking of the Downfall of Antichrist: <note n="†" place="bottom">Ver. 10, 17, 19.</note> And each Time, evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently signifies a very short Space of Time. And there is no Reason why we should not understand the same Phrase in the same Sense, when it is used here concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Rise of Antichrist.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> greatly insists upon it, that what is spo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken as continuing 1260 Days, is not so much any spiritual Authority or ecclesiastical Power of the Pope, over the Nations of Christendom, as his temporal Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment and Dominion in that individual City of <hi>Rome</hi>; and therefore to determine when these 1260 Days or Years began, and when they will end, we must consider when the Pope first received this his temporal Power over this City of <hi>Rome,</hi> and the neighbouring Regions, called <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s <hi>Patrimony.</hi> But I can see no good Reason for this. Indeed it is strange, if it be so. God has been pleased in these Revelations and Prophecies, which he has given for the Benefit of his <hi>Church</hi> in <hi>ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral,</hi> to speak much concerning an antichristian Power that should arise, that should <hi>persecute the Saints, and
<pb n="141" facs="unknown:005938_0149_0000000000000000"/>
scatter the Power of the holy People,</hi> and be an Occasion of great Affliction <hi>to the Church of Christ</hi>; and in these Revelations, in both old Testament and new, has decla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red, and often repeated it, that his Dominion shall con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue so long, and no longer; and for the Comfort of his <hi>Church in general,</hi> Christ hath sworn with great So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemnity, that the Continuance of this persecuting Power shall be thus limited; <hi>Dan.</hi> xii.7. Now it would be strange, if in all this the Thing principally intended is not that Dominion of this antichristian Power that chiefly concerns the Church of Christ <hi>in general,</hi> but merely his temporal Dominion over one Province in <hi>Italy,</hi> called <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s <hi>Patrimony.</hi> Doubtless that Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion of Antichrist which the Prophecies insist upon and describe, is the Dominion whose Duration and Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits those Prophecies declare. But the Dominion of Antichrist which the Prophecies insist upon and describe, is not any Dominion over a particular Province in <hi>Italy,</hi> but the Dominion by which he succeeds the four great <hi>Monarchies of the World</hi>; (Dan. vii.) The Dominion by which he <hi>succeeds the Dragon in his Power, Throne and great Authority</hi>; (Rev. xiii.2.) The Dominion in which he has <hi>Power given him over all Kindreds, Tongues and Nations</hi>; (Ver. 7.) The Dominion by which <hi>the great Whore sits on many Waters</hi>; (Chap. xvii.1.) which the Angel explains to be <hi>Peoples and Multitudes and Nations and Tongues</hi>; (Ver. 15.) and the Domi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion in which he <hi>reigns over the ten Kings,</hi> into which the Roman Empire is divided; (<hi>Rev.</hi> xiii.1. and xvii.3, 12, 13.) The Beast that <hi>had ten Horns,</hi> is not the City of <hi>Rome</hi> and the neighbouring Region, but the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire; they are the Horns or the Kings, not of the City, but of the Empire. If we consider what
<pb n="142" facs="unknown:005938_0150_0000000000000000"/>
is expressed in the Passages themselves, which speak of the three Years and half of Antichrist, they will lead us to understand something very diverse from the Dura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of his temporal Dominion over <hi>St. Peter</hi>'s <hi>Patri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony.</hi> In Dan. vii.25. the Time, Times and an half, of the little Horn, is expresly the Continuance of Time wherein <hi>it shall be given to him to change Times and Laws, and wear out the Saints of the most High</hi>: And in Chap. xii.7. 'tis spoken of as <hi>the Time of his Scattering the Power of the holy People</hi>: In Rev. xi.2. the forty and two Months is spoken of as the Time of Antichrist's <hi>treading under Foot the Court of the Temple and the holy City</hi>; i. e. the external or visible christian Church a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in the World, or the Nations of Christendom. In Ver. 3. the 1260 Days of Antichrist are spoken of as the Time of the <hi>Witnesses prophesying in Sackcloth</hi>; and in Chap. xii.6, and 14. the Time of the <hi>Woman's being in the Wilderness,</hi> which was thro' the great Power that Antichrist had over the christian World, and not his small temporal Dominion in <hi>Italy.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>'Tis true, some Regard is had in the Prophecies to the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> the City built on seven Hills: Which being the Fountain of all Rule and Authority in the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy, and the capital City of the Empire, from whence the whole Empire was denominated, and the Place where the Head of the Empire usually resi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, was properly made use of by the Angel, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvii.9, 18. to shew what Empire Antichrist should rule over, and what City he should usually reside in. And this is all that can be meant by the Words of the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel; and not that those Streets and Walls, and that very Ground, were such main and essential Things in what the Prophecy intended by the Beast; That when
<pb n="143" facs="unknown:005938_0151_0000000000000000"/>
Antichrist's Dominion began in <hi>that Place,</hi> then the Beast ceases. For if so, then it will follow, that the Beast had his Head wounded to Death a second Time, and ceased to be, when the Popes resided at <hi>Avignon</hi> in <hi>France,</hi> for the best Part of a Century; when not only the Popes did not reside in <hi>Rome,</hi> nor in any Part of St. <hi>Peter</hi>'s Patrimony, nor any Part of <hi>Italy</hi>; but some of them were neither <hi>Romans,</hi> nor <hi>Italians.</hi> Tho' the An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gel says of the great Whore, Rev. xvii.18. <hi>The Woman which thou sawest, is that great City which reigns over the Kings of the Earth</hi>: yet by the City, in this Case, is not meant so much what was contained within those <hi>Roman</hi> Walls, as the <hi>Roman Empire</hi>; as is evident by Chap. xi.8. <hi>And their dead Bodies shall lie in the Street of the great City, which is spiritually called</hi> Sodom <hi>and</hi> Egypt.

               </gap>erpreter, under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stands the City of <hi>Rome,</hi> strictly speaking, but the <hi>Roman</hi> Monarchy.</p>
            <p>And tho' it be true, as Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> observes, the Pope's ecclesiastical Monarchy, and Power and Influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence through Christendom, was greatly established and advanced by <hi>Pepin</hi>'s making him a temporal Prince over the Exarchate of <hi>Ravenna</hi>; yet, I would ask, whether the Pope's Power and Influence in the World, and his Ability to disturb the Quiet of the Nations of Christen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and (as 'tis expressed in <hi>Daniel) to change Times and Laws,</hi> and to carry his own Designs, in the various Countries and Kingdoms of <hi>Europe,</hi> was not greater be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore <hi>Pepin,</hi> than it is now, and has been for a long Time? And yet Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> supposes that <hi>now</hi> is properly the Time of Antichrist's Reign, that the 1260 Years of his Reign continues, and will continue for a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout
<pb n="144" facs="unknown:005938_0152_0000000000000000"/>
270 Years longer; tho' his Power be now so small, and has been declining ever since the Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and still declines continually.</p>
            <p>One Thing that Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> supposes confirms his Opinion of so late a Beginning of the 1260 Years of the Reign of the <hi>Beast,</hi> is the Order of the several <hi>Periods</hi> of this Prophecy, and the Manner of their <hi>succeeding</hi> one another.</p>
            <p>As to his particular Scheme of the <hi>seven Periods,</hi> so divided and limited, and so obviously ranked in such Order, and following one another in such direct and continued <hi>Succession,</hi> and each ending in a State of Peace, Safety and Happiness to the Church of God, it seems to me to be more ingenious than solid, and that many Things might be said to demonstrate it not to be found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in the Truth of Things, and the real Design of the divine Author of this Prophecy. But now to enter into a particular and full Examination of it, would be to lengthen out this Discourse far beyond it's proper Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mits. I would only observe (which directly concerns my present Purpose) that to make out this Scheme, Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> supposes that the fifth and sixth Trumpets, that bring on the two first Woes, and the whole 9th Chap. of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> altogether respects the <hi>Saracens.</hi> But it appears to me not very credible, that the <hi>Saracens</hi> should have so much said of 'em in this Prophecy, as to have a whole Chapter taken up about them, and not a Word in the whole Prophecy be said about the <hi>Turks,</hi> who immediately succeeded them <note n="*" place="bottom">For tho' it be true, that the Reign of <hi>Othman,</hi> or <hi>Ottoman,</hi> who began what they call the <hi>Ottoman</hi> Empire, was a long Time after this; yet the Turks themselves, under other Princes, in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment they set up in Territories that had formerly been possess'd by Christians, and in their over-run<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning and ravaging Christian Countries, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately succeeded the <hi>Saracens</hi>; and from thence<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forward have been a terrible, and almost continual Scourge to the Church.</note> in the same Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion,
<pb n="145" facs="unknown:005938_0153_0000000000000000"/>
and proceeding on the same Principles, and were so much more considerable, and brought vastly greater Calamities on the christian World, and have set up and long maintained one of the greatest, strongest and most extraordinary Empires that ever the World saw, and have been the most terrible Scourge to Christendom, that ever divine Providence made Use of, and one of the greatest of all God's Plagues on the World of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Lowman,</hi> in Pursuance of his Scheme, also sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poses, (which is yet more incredible) this Period of the Trumpets ends in <hi>a State of Safety, Peace and Happiness to the Church of God</hi>; so that, on that Occasion, <hi>there are great Voices in Heaven, saying, The Kingdoms of this World are become the Kingdoms of our Lord and of his Christ,</hi> Chap. xi.15. <note n="‡" place="bottom">Preface of his Paraphrase, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> P. 13, 14, and 16.</note> And yet he supposes, that it issues in setting up the Kingdom of Antichrist; and that about that very Time, when these heavenly Voices so joyfully proclaimed this, the Beast was enthroned, and the Time, Times, and Half, or 1260 Days of his Reign began, which is spoken of every where, as the Time of the Church's greatest Darkness and Trouble,

the Time wherein <hi>the little Horn should wear out the Saints of the most High,</hi> Dan. vii.25. <hi>The Time ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed for his scattering the Power of the holy People,</hi> Dan. xii.7. <hi>The Time of the Woman's being in the Wilderness,</hi> Rev. xii.6, 14.

            <p>However, I do not deny that the Time when Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> supposes the Reign of the Beast began, even the Time when <hi>P<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> with Relation to the Rise and Fall of Antichrist; it is this. As the Power of Antichrist, and the Corruption of the apostate Church, rose not at once, but by several notable Steps and Degrees; so i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </gap> will in the like Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner fall: And that divers Steps and Seasons of Destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the spiritual <hi>Babylon,</hi> and Revival and Advance<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the true Church, are prophesied of under one. Tho' it be true, that there is some particular Event, that prevails above all others in the Intention of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy, some one remarkable Season of the Destruction of the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> and papal Power and Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and Advancement of true Religion, that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies have a principal Respect to.</p>
            <p>It was certainly thus with Regard to the Prophecies of the Destruction of old <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Church's De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liverance from Captivity and Oppression by that City and Kingdom; which is abundantly alluded to in these Prophecies of the Revelation, as a noted Type of the Oppression of the Church of Christ by the Church of
<pb n="147" facs="unknown:005938_0155_0000000000000000"/>
               <hi>Rome,</hi> calling the Latter so often by the Name of <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> and the Church of Christ <hi>Ierusalem.</hi> The Capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vity of the <hi>Iews</hi> by the <hi>Babylonians</hi> was not perfected at once, but was brought on by several notable Steps. So neither was the Restoration of the <hi>Iewish</hi> Church, after the Captivity, perfected at once. It was several Times foretold, that the Duration of the Captivity should be 70 Years; and also, that after 70 Years were accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished, God would destroy <hi>Babylon; Ier.</hi> xxv.11, 12, &amp;c—. But this Period had manifestly several different Beginnings, and several Endings. Thus from <hi>Iehoikim</hi>'s Captivity to <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Decree, for the Return of the <hi>Iews,</hi> and the Re-building of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> was 70 Years. And from <hi>Zedekiah</hi>'s Captivity to <hi>Darius</hi>'s Decree (<hi>Ezra</hi> vi.) 70 Years. And from the last carry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of all, <hi>Ier.</hi> lii.30. to the finishing and dedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the Temple, was also 70 Years. So also the Prophecies of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Destruction were fulfill'd by se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Steps. These Prophecies seem to have a principal Respect to that Destruction that was accomplished by <hi>Cyrus,</hi> at the End of the first 70 Years forementioned: But there were other Things in the very same Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, that were not fulfilled 'till the 4th Year of <hi>Darius</hi>; when what remain'd of <hi>Babylon</hi> was subject to another dreadful Destruction; which in a great Measure com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleated it's Desolation; which was at the End of the second 70 Years, and at the same Time that the Resto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of the <hi>Iews</hi> was perfected by the Decree of <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rius.</hi>

<pb n="148" facs="unknown:005938_0156_0000000000000000"/>
in the same Prophecies of <hi>Babylon</hi>'s Destruction, rendring it thenceforward perfectly and perpetually de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solate, and the Haunt of Serpents and wild Beasts, that were not fulfilled 'till more than 200 Years after, in the Time of <hi>Seleucus</hi> King of <hi>Syria.</hi>

These Prophecies of the Destruction of <hi>Tyre</hi> were ful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>filled by various Steps. Many Things were fulfill'd in the Destruction of the old City by <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi>; <note n="*" place="bottom">Ibid. 128, 129, 130.</note> and yet other Parts of the same Prophecy were fulfill'd by <hi>Alexander</hi>; <note n="‡" place="bottom">Ibid. p. 693.</note> which was about 240 Years after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards. And yet both these Desolations are prophesied of under one.</p>
            <p>And thus it seems to me very probable, that it will prove, with Respect to the Prophecies of the Destruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of mystical <hi>Babylon.</hi> 'Tis I think pretty manifest by the Prophecies, that this Antichristian Hierarchy and apostate Church will at last be so destroyed, that there shall be no Remainders of it left, and shall have as per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect a Desolation, before God has done with her, as old <hi>Babylon</hi> had; there shall be no such Thing as Pope or Church of <hi>Rome</hi> in the World. <note n="‖" place="bottom">See <hi>Rev.</hi> xviii.21—23.—and xix.20, 21. <hi>Dan</hi> vii.26, 27.</note> It seems also pretty
<pb n="149" facs="unknown:005938_0157_0000000000000000"/>
manifest that after that Event that is chiefly intended in the Prophecies of Antichrist's Destruction, there will be some Remains of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church. This appears by that most particular and large Description of that Destruction, <hi>Rev.</hi> xviii. There it seems to be implied, not only that many shall yet remain of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> that shall bewail her Overthrow, of her People and Clergy; (<hi>Ver.</hi> 11, 15, 17, 18.) But that there should be some Princes among them, <hi>Kings of the Earth, that have committed Fornication, and lived deliciously with her</hi>; (Ver. 9, 10.) And it is exceeding improbable in it self, that every Papist, in each Quarter of the World, should be destroyed, or cease from the World, at one Blow. And as long as so considerable a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber remains, as may be gathered from the Prophecy, they will doubtless have an Hierarchy; and there will be one among them that will bear the Name of a <hi>Pope.</hi> Altho' the Church of <hi>Rome</hi> shall be mainly destroyed, and the Interest of Popery shall be sunk very low in the World; so that there will yet remain such a Thing as a Papal Church and Hierarchy in the World, to be wholly extirpated at another Period, sometime after that great Overthrow principally insisted on in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecies. And this second Destruction of Antichrist, or rather Extirpation of his Remains, together with the compleat Extirpation of all Remains of Mahometanism, Heathenism and Heresy through the World, and the finishing Stroke towards the Overthrow of <hi>Satan</hi>'s vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sible Kingdom on Earth, and so the Beginning of the <hi>Millennium,</hi> or spiritual Rest of the World, may, for ought I know, be about the Time Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> speaks of; agreable to the Opinion of the ancient <hi>Iews,</hi> and many Christian Divines that have followed them, that
<pb n="150" facs="unknown:005938_0158_0000000000000000"/>
the World would stand six thousand Years; and then, the seventh thousand Years should be the World's Rest or Sabbath. The Ruin of the popish Interest is but a small Part of what is requisite, in Order to introduce and settle such a State of Things, as the World is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented as being in, in that Millennium that is de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribed <hi>Rev.</hi> xx. wherein <hi>Satan</hi>'s visible Kingdom is e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very where totally extirpated, and a perfect End put to all Heresies, Delusions and false Religions whatsoever, through the whole Earth, and <hi>Satan</hi> thenceforward <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceives the Nations no more,</hi> and has no Place any where but in Hell. This is the Sabbatism of the World; when all shall be in a holy Rest, when the Wolf shall dwell with the Lamb, and there shall be nothing to hurt or offend, and there shall be Abundance of Peace, and the Earth shall be full of the Knowledge of the Lord as the Waters cover the Seas, and God's <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>eople shall dwell in quiet resting Places. There is not the least Reason to think, that all this will be brought to pass as it were at one Stroke, or that from the present lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table State of Things, there should be brought about and compleated the Destruction of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> the entire Extirpation of all Infidelity, Heresies, Supersti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions and Schisms, through all Christendom, and the Conversion of all the <hi>Iews,</hi> and the full enlightning and Conversion of all <hi>Mahometan</hi> and Heathen Nations, thro' the whole Earth, on every Side of the Globe, and from the North to the South Pole, and the full Settlement of all in the pure christian Faith and Order, all as it were in the Issue of one Battle, and by Means of the Victory of the Church in one great Conflict with her Enemies. This would contradict many Things in Scripture, which represent this great Event to be brought to pass
<pb n="151" facs="unknown:005938_0159_0000000000000000"/>
by a gradual Progress of Religion; as Leaven that gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dually spreads, 'till it has diffused it self through the whole Lump; and a Plant of Mustard, which from a very small Seed, gradually becomes a great Tree; (Matt. xiii.31, 32, 33.) <hi>and like Seed which a Man casts into the Ground, that springs and grows up, Night and Day; and first brings forth the Blade, then the Ear, then the full Corn in the Ear.</hi> And especially would this contradict the prophetical Representation in <hi>Ezek.</hi> xlvii. where the Progress of Religion is represented by the gradual Increase of the Waters of the Sanctuary; being first a small Spring issuing out from under the Threshold of the Temple; and then, after they had run a thousand Cubits, being up to the Ankles; and at the End of another thousand Cubits, up to the Knees; and at the End of another thousand, up to the Loyns; and afterwards a great River, that could not be pass'd over; and being finally brought into the Sea, and heal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Waters even of the vast Ocean. If the Spirit of God should be immediately poured out, and that great Work of God's Power and Grace should now begin, which in it's Progress and Issue should compleat this glorious Effect; there must be an amazing and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parallel'd Progress of the Work and Manifestation of divine Power to bring so much to pass, by the Year 2000. Would it not be a great Thing, to be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plished in one half Century, that Religion, in the Power and Purity of it, should so prevail, as to gain the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest over all those many Things that stand in Opposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to it among <hi>Protestants,</hi> and gain the upper Hand through the Protestant World? And if in another, it should go on so to prevail, as to get the Victory over all the Opposition and Strength of the Kingdom of <hi>An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichrist,</hi>
               <pb n="152" facs="unknown:005938_0160_0000000000000000"/>
so as to gain the Ascendent in that which is now the Popish World? And if in a third Half-Cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tury, it should prevail and subdue the greater Part of the <hi>Mahometan</hi> World, and bring in the <hi>Iewish</hi> Nation, in all their Dispersions? And then in the next whole Century, the whole <hi>Heathen</hi> World should be enligh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten'd and converted to the christian Faith, throughout all Parts of <hi>Affrica, Asia, America</hi> and <hi>Terra Australis,</hi> and be thoroughly settled in Christian Faith and Order, without any Remainders of their old Delusions and Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstitions, and this attended with an utter Extirpation of the Remnant of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and all the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licks of <hi>Mahometism,</hi> Heresy, Schism and Enthusiasm, and a Suppression of all Remains of open Vice and Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morality, and every Sort of visible Enemy to true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, through the whole Earth, and bring to an End all the unhappy Commotions, Tumults, and Calamities occasion'd by such great Changes, and all Things so ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>justed and settled through the World, that the World thenceforward should enjoy an holy Rest or Sabbatism?</p>
            <p>I have thus distinguished what belongs to a bringing of the World from it's present State, to the happy State of the Millennium, the better to give a View of the Great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness of the Work; and not, that I pretend so much as to conjecture, that Things will be accomplished just in this Order. The whole Work is not the less great and wonderful, to be accomplished in such a Space of Time, in whatever Order the different Parts of it succeed each other. They that think that what has been mention'd would not be swift Progress, yea amazingly swift, don't consider how great the Work is, and the vast and innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Obstacles that are in the Way. It was a won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful Thing, when the Christian Religion, after Christ's
<pb n="153" facs="unknown:005938_0161_0000000000000000"/>
Ascension, so prevailed, as to get the Ascendant in the <hi>Roman</hi> Empire in about 300 Years; but that was no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing to this.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 4. There are, as I apprehend, good Reasons to hope, that that Work of God's Spirit will begin in a little Time, which in the Progress of it will overthrow the Kingdom of Antichrist, and in it's Issue destroy <hi>Satan</hi>'s visible Kingdom on Earth.</p>
            <p>The Prophecy of the 6th Vial, <hi>Rev.</hi> xvi.12,—16. if we take it in it's Connection with the other Vials, and consider those providential Events, by which the preceeding Vials have manifestly been fulfilled, I hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly conceive, affords just Ground for such a Hope.</p>
            <p>'Tis very plain from this whole Chapter, as also the preceeding and following, that all these seven Vials are Vials of God's Wrath on Antichrist; one is not pour'd out on the <hi>Iews,</hi> another on the <hi>Turks,</hi> another on <hi>Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gans,</hi> another on the Church of <hi>Rome</hi>; but they all sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nify God's successive Judgments or Plagues on the Beast and his Kingdom, which is in this Chapter and almost every where in this Book, called GREAT BA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>BYLON. And therefore undoubtedly, when it is said, <hi>The sixth Angel poured out his Vial on the River</hi> Euphrates, <hi>and the Water thereof was dried up, that the Way of the Kings of the East might be prepared</hi>; by the River <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> is meant something some Way appertaining to this mystical <hi>Babylon</hi>; as that River that ran through <hi>Chaldea,</hi> called <hi>Euphrates,</hi> was something appertaining to the literal <hi>Babylon.</hi> And 'tis very manifest, that here is in the Prophecy of this Vial an Allusion to that by which the Way was prepared for the Destruction of <hi>Babylon</hi> by <hi>Cyrus</hi>; which was by turning the Channel
<pb n="154" facs="unknown:005938_0162_0000000000000000"/>
of the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> which ran through the Midst of the City, whereby the Way of the Kings of the East, the Princes of <hi>Media</hi> and <hi>Persia,</hi> was prepared to come in under the Walls of the City, at each End, where the Waters used to run, and destroy it; as they did that Night wherein <hi>Daniel</hi> interpreted the Hand-Writing on the Wall, against <hi>Belshazzar, Dan.</hi> v.30.

was the last Thing done by the Besiegers of <hi>Babylon,</hi> before her actual Destruction: As this sixth Vial is the last Vial of God's Wrath but one, on the mystical <hi>Ba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bylon</hi>; and the Effect of it, the drying up the Channel of the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> is the last Thing done against it, before it's actual Destruction by the seventh Vial, and opens the Way for those that fight in a spiritual War against it, speedily to bring on it's Ruin.</p>
            <p>Hence I think it may without Dispute be determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, that by the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> in the Prophecy of this Vial, is meant something appertaining or relating to the mystical <hi>Babylon,</hi> or the antichristian Church and Kingdom, that serves that, or is a Benefit to it, in a Way answerable to that in which the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> served old <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Removal of which will in like Manner prepare the Way for her Enemies to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy her. And therefore what we have to do in the first Place, in order to find out what is intended by the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> in this Prophecy, is to consider how the literal <hi>Euphrates</hi> served old <hi>Babylon.</hi> And it may be noted, that <hi>Euphrates</hi> was of remarkable Benefit to that City in two Respects: It served the City as a <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply</hi>; it was let through the midst of the City by an ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tificial Canal, and ran through the Midst of the Palace of the King of <hi>Babylon</hi>; that Part of his Palace called the <hi>old Palace,</hi> standing on one Side, and the other Part called the <hi>new Palace,</hi> on the other; with Communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cations from one Part to another, above the Waters, by a Bridge, and under the Waters, by a vaulted or arched Passage; that the City, and especially the Palace, might have the Convenience of it's Waters, and be plentiful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly supplied with Water. And another Way that the Waters of <hi>Euphrat<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>s</hi> served <hi>Babylon,</hi> was as an <hi>Impedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi>
               <pb n="156" facs="unknown:005938_0164_0000000000000000"/>
and <hi>Obstacle</hi> in the Way of it's Enemies, to hinder their Access to it to destroy it. For there was a vast Moat round the City, without the Walls, of prodigious Width and Depth, fill'd with the Water of the River, to hinder the Access of her Besiegers: And at each End of the City, the River served instead of Walls. And therefore when <hi>Cyrus</hi> had dried up the River, the Moat was emptied, and the Channel of the River under the Walls left dry; and so his Way was prepared.</p>
            <p>And therefore 'tis natural to suppose, that by drying up the Waters of the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> in the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of the Destruction of the new <hi>Babylon,</hi> to prepare the Way of her Enemies, is meant the drying up her <hi>Incomes</hi> and <hi>Supplies</hi>; and the Removal of those Things that hitherto have been the chief <hi>Obstacles</hi> in the Way of those that in this Book are represented as at War with her and seeking her Destruction, (spoken of <hi>Rev.</hi> xix.11 to the End, and <hi>Chap.</hi> xii.7.) that have hin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered their Progress and Success, or that have been the chief Impediments in the Way of the Protestant Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion. The first Thing is the drying the Streams of the Wealth of the new <hi>Babylon,</hi> the temporal Supplies, Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venues and vast Incomes of the <hi>Romish</hi> Church, and Riches of the Popish Dominions. <hi>Waters</hi> in Scripture Language very often signifie Provision and Supplies, both temporal and spiritual; as in <hi>Prov.</hi> ix.17. <hi>Isai.</hi> xxxiii.16.—xliii.20.—lv.1.—and lviii.11. <hi>Ier.</hi> ii.13, and 18.—xvii.8, and 13<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and in other Places in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable. The temporal Supplies of a People are very often in Scripture called Waters; as Isai. v.13. <hi>Therefore my People is gone into Captivity, and their ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Men are famished, and their Multitude dried up with Thirst.</hi> i. e. deprived of the Supports and Supplies
<pb n="157" facs="unknown:005938_0165_0000000000000000"/>
of Life. And the drying up the Waters of a City or Kingdom, is often used in Scripture Prophecy, for the depriving them of their Wealth, as the Scripture ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plains it self, Hos. xiii.15. <hi>His Spring shall become dry, and his Fountain shall be dried up; He shall spoil the Treasure of all pleasant Vessels.</hi> Isai. xv.6, 7. <hi>The Waters of</hi> Nimrim <hi>shall be desolate; for the Hay is withered; the Grass faileth; there is no green Thing. Therefore the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bundance they have gotten, and that which they have laid up, shall they carry away to the Brook of the Willows.</hi> By the <hi>Brook of the Willows</hi> there seems to be a Reference to the Waters of <hi>Assyria</hi> or <hi>Chaldea,</hi> whose Streams a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bounded with Willows (compare <hi>Psal.</hi> cxxxvii.2.) So that the carrying away the Treasures of <hi>Moab,</hi> and adding of them to the Treasures of <hi>Assyria,</hi> is here re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented by the Figure of turning away the Waters of <hi>Nimrim</hi> from the Country of <hi>Moab,</hi> and adding them to the Waters of <hi>Assyria,</hi> as the Prophecy explains it self. Yea, even in the Prophecies of the Destruction of <hi>Babylon</hi> it self, the depriving her of her Treasures, seems to be one Thing intended by the drying up of her Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters. This seems manifest by the Words of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy in Jer. l.37, 38. <hi>A Sword is upon her Treasures, and they shall be robbed; a Drought is upon her Waters, and they shall be dried up.</hi> Compared with Chap. li.15. <hi>O thou that dwellest upon many Waters, abundant in Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sures</hi>: with Ver. 36. <hi>I will dry up her Sea, and make her Springs dry.</hi> The Wealth, Revenues and vast In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> are the Waters by which that <hi>Babylon</hi> has been nourished and supported; these are the Waters which the Popish Clergy and Members of the <hi>Romish</hi> Hierarchy thirst after, and are continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally drinking down, with insatiable Appetite; and they
<pb n="158" facs="unknown:005938_0166_0000000000000000"/>
are Waters that have been flowing into that spiritual City like a great River; ecclesiastical Persons posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing a very great Part of the Popish Dominions: As this <hi>Babylon</hi> is represented as vastly rich, in this Prophecy of the <hi>Apocalypse,</hi> especially in the 17th and 18th Chapters. These are especially the Waters that supply the Palace of the King of this new <hi>Babylon, viz.</hi> the Pope; as the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> ran through the Midst of the Palace of the King of old <hi>Babylon.</hi> The Revenues of the Pope have been like the Waters of a great River, coming into his Palace, from innumerable Fountains, and by innumerable Branches and lesser Streams, coming from many various and distant Countries.</p>
            <p>This Prophecy represents to us two Cities very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary the one to the other; <hi>viz. New-Babylon</hi> and the <hi>New-Ierusalem,</hi> and a River running through the Midst of each. The new <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> which signifies the Church of Christ, especially in her best Estate, is descri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bed as having a River running through the Midst of it, <hi>Rev.</hi> xxii.1, 2. This River, as might easily be made most evident, by comparing this with Abundance of o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Scriptures, undoubtedly signifies the divine Supplies, and rich &amp; abundant spiritual Incomes and Provision of that holy City. Mr. <hi>Lowman,</hi> in his late Exposition, says, <hi>It represents a constant Provision for the comfortable and happy Life of all the Inhabitants of this City of God.</hi> And in his Notes on the same Place, observes as follows;
<q>Water, (says he) as necessary to the Support of Life, and as it contributes in great Cities, especially in hot eastern Countries, to the Ornament of the Place, and Delight of the Inhabitants, is a very pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Representation of the Enjoyment of all Things, both for the Support and Pleasure of Life.</q>
As the
<pb n="159" facs="unknown:005938_0167_0000000000000000"/>
River that runs through the new <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> the Church of Christ, that refreshes that holy spiritual Society, sig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifies their spiritual Supplies, to satisfy their spiritual Thirst; so the River that runs through the new <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon,</hi> the antichristian Church, that wicked carnal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety, signifies, according to the opposite Character of the City, her worldly, carnal Supplies, to satisfy their carnal Desires and Thirstings.</p>
            <p>This new <hi>Ierusalem</hi> is called in this Book the <hi>Para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dise of God</hi>; and therefore is represented as having the Tree of Life growing in it, <hi>Chap.</hi> ii.7. and xxii.2. And it being described, as tho' a River ran through the Midst of it, there seems to be some Allusion to the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cient Paradise in <hi>Eden,</hi> of which we are told that there ran a River through the Midst of it to water it; (<hi>Gen.</hi> ii.10.) i. e. to supply the Plants of it with Nourish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. And this River was this very same River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> that afterwards ran through <hi>Babylon.</hi> And in one and the other, it represented the divers Supplies of two opposite Cities: In <hi>Eden,</hi> it represented the spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual Supplies and Wealth of the true Christian Church, in her spiritual Advancement and Glory; and seems to be so made use of <hi>Rev.</hi> xxii.1, 2. In the other it repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sented the outward carnal Supplies of the false antichris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tian Church, in her worldly Pomp and vain Glory, <hi>Chap.</hi> xvi.12.</p>
            <p>When the Waters that supply this mystical <hi>Babylon,</hi> come to be dried up in this Sense, it will prepare the Way for the Enemies of antichristian Corruption, that seek her Overthrow. The Wealth of the Church of <hi>Rome,</hi> and of the Powers that support it, is very much it's Defence. After the Streams of her Revenues and Riches are dried up, or very greatly diminished, her
<pb n="160" facs="unknown:005938_0168_0000000000000000"/>
Walls will be as it were broken down, and she will be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come weak and defenceless, and exposed to easy Ruin.</p>
            <p>When <hi>Ioab</hi> had taken that Part of the City of <hi>Rab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bah,</hi> that was called <hi>the City of Waters,</hi> whence the City had it's Supply of Water, the Fountains of the Brook <hi>Iabbok</hi> being probably there<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and which was also called the Royal City, probably because there the King had his Palace and Gardens, on the Account of it's peculiar Pleasantness; I say, when he had taken this, the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest of the rest of the City was easy; his Message to <hi>David</hi> implies that the City now might be taken at Pleasure, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> xii.27, 28. 'Tis possible that by the pouring out of the sixth Vial to dry up the River of the mystical <hi>Babylon,</hi> there may be something like the taking the City of Waters in <hi>Rabbah</hi>: some one of the chief of the popish Powers, that has been the main Strength and Support of the popish Cause, or from whence that Church has it's chief Supplies, may be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroyed, or converted, or greatly reduced. But this Events must determine.</p>
            <p>In the Prophecies of <hi>Egypt</hi>'s Destruction, it is signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, that when their Rivers and Waters should be dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up, in that Sense, that the Streams of their temporal Supplies should be averted from them, their Defence would be gone; Isai. xix.4, &amp;c. <hi>The</hi> Egypti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>s <hi>will I give over into the Hand of a cruel Lord—and the Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters shall fail from the Sea, and the River shall be wasted and dried up, and the Brooks of</hi> DEFENCE <hi>shall be emptied and dried up, and the Reeds and Flags shall wither;— Every Thing sown by the Brooks shall wither:—The Fishers also shall mourn</hi>—.</p>
            <p>Those whose Way was prepared to come in and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy <hi>Babylon,</hi> by the drying up the River of <hi>Euphrates,</hi>
               <pb n="161" facs="unknown:005938_0169_0000000000000000"/>
were the Army that was at War with <hi>Babylon, Cyrus</hi> the King, and his Host, that sought her Overthrow: So there seems to be all Reason to suppose, that those whose Way will be prepared to come in and destroy mystical <hi>Babylon,</hi> by drying up the mystical <hi>Euphrates,</hi> are that King and Army that are in this Book of <hi>Revelation</hi> re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>presented as at War with Antichrist. And what King and Army that is, we may see in Chap. xii.7. and xix.11, to the End; <hi>Michael</hi> the King of Angels, and his Angels; he <hi>whose Name is called the Word of God,</hi> and <hi>that has on his Vesture and on his Thigh a Name written, King of Kings, and Lord of Lords; and the heavenly Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies that follow him, cloathed in fine Linnen white and clean. Cyrus</hi> the Chief of the Kings of the East, that destroyed <hi>Babylon,</hi> and redeemed God's Church from thence, and restored <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> seems in that particular Affair very manifestly to be spoken of as a Type of Christ: God calls him <hi>his Shepherd, to perform his Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure, to say to</hi> Jerusalem, <hi>Thou shalt be built, and to the Temple, Thy Foundation shall be laid,</hi> Isai. xliv 28. God calls him his <hi>Messiah</hi>; Chap. xlv.1. <hi>Thus saith the Lord to his Anointed</hi> (in the Original, <hi>to his Messiah) to</hi> Cyrus. He is spoken of as one <hi>that God had raised up in Righteousness, that he might build his City, and freely redeem his Captives, or let them go without Price or Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward,</hi> Chap. xlv.13. He is said to be one whom <hi>God had loved,</hi> Chap. xlviii.14. In like Manner as the <hi>Messiah</hi> is said to be <hi>God's Elect, in whom his Soul de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lighteth.</hi> As by <hi>Babylon,</hi> in the <hi>Revelation,</hi> is meant that antichristian Society that is typified by old <hi>Babylon</hi>; so by the Kings of the East, that should destroy this an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tichristian Church, must be meant those Enemies of it that were typifyed by <hi>Cyrus</hi> and other Chieftains of the
<pb n="162" facs="unknown:005938_0170_0000000000000000"/>
East, that destroyed old <hi>Babylon; viz.</hi> Christ, who was born, lived, died and rose in the East, together with those spiritual Princes that follow him, the Principalities and Powers in heavenly Places, and those Ministers and Saints that are <hi>Kings and Priests,</hi> and shall reign on Earth; especially those Leaders and Heads of God's People, those christian Ministers and Magistrates, that shall be distinguished as publick Blessings to his Church, and chief Instruments of the Overthrow of Antichrist.</p>
            <p>As the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> served the City of <hi>Babylon</hi> as a <hi>Supply,</hi> so it also was before observed, it served as an <hi>Impediment</hi> or <hi>Obstacle</hi> to hinder the Access of it's Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies: As there was a vast Moat round the City, fill'd with the Water of the River, which was left empty when <hi>Euphrates</hi> was dried up. And therefore we may suppose that another Thing meant by the Effect of the sixth Vial, is the Removal of those Things which hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to have been the chief Obstacles in the Way of the Progress of the true Religion, and the Victory of the Church of Christ over her Enemies: Which have been the corrupt Doctrines and Practices that have prevailed in Protestant Countries, and the Doubts and Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties that attend many Doctrines of the true Religion, and the many Divisions and Contentions that subsist a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong Protestants. The Removal of those would won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derfully prepare the Way for Christ and his Armies, to go forward and prevail against their Enemies, in a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Propagation of true Religion. So that this Vial, which is to prepare the Way for Christ and his People, seems to have Respect to that remarkable preparing the Way for Christ, by <hi>levelling Mountains, exalting Valleys, drying up Rivers,</hi> and <hi>removing Stumbling-Blocks,</hi> which is often spoken of in the Prophecies, as what shall next
<pb n="163" facs="unknown:005938_0171_0000000000000000"/>
preceed the Church's latter-day Glory; as Isai. xlii.13, &amp;c. <hi>The Lord shall go forth as a mighty Man; he shall stir up Iealousy as a Man of War;—He shall pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail against his Enemies.—I will make waste Mountains and Hills, and dry up all their Herbs; and I will make the Rivers Islands, and I will dry up the Pools; and I will bring the Blind by a Way that they know not, and I will lead them in Paths that they have not known; I will make Darkness light before them, and crooked Things straight. These Things will I do unto them, and not forsake them.</hi> Chap. xl.3, 4, 5. <hi>Prepare ye the Way of the Lord, make straight in the Desart an High-Way for our God: Every Valley shall be exalted, and every Mountain and Hill shall be made low, and the crooked shall be made straight, and rough Places plain; and the Glory of the Lord shall be re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vealed, and all Flesh shall see it together.</hi> Chap. xi.15, 16. <hi>And the Lord shall utterly destroy the Tongue of the</hi> Egyptian <hi>Sea, and with his mighty Wind shall he shake his Hand over the River, and shall smite it in the seven Streams thereof, and make Men go over dry shod: And there shall be an Highway for the Remnant of his People which shall be left, from</hi> Assyria, <hi>like as it was to</hi> Israel, <hi>in the Day that he come out of the Land of</hi> Egypt. Chap. lvii.14. <hi>Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the Way, take up the Stum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling-Block out of the Way of my People.</hi> And Chap. lxii.10. <hi>Go through, go through the Gates; prepare ye the Way of the People; cast up, cast up the Highway; gather out the Stones; lift up a Standard for the People.</hi> Zech. x.10, 11, 12. <hi>I will bring them again also out of the Land of</hi> Egypt, <hi>and gather them out of</hi> Assyria; <hi>And I will bring them into the Land of</hi> Gilead <hi>and</hi> Lebanon; <hi>and Place shall not be found for them. And he shall pass through the Sea with Affliction, and shall smite the Waves
<pb n="164" facs="unknown:005938_0172_0000000000000000"/>
of the Sea; and all the Deeps of the River shall dry up: And the Pride of</hi> Assyria <hi>shall be brought down, and the Scepter of</hi> Egypt <hi>shall depart away: And I will strengthen them in the Lord, and they shall walk up and down in his Name, saith the Lord.</hi> And 'tis worthy to be remark'd that as <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s destroying <hi>Babylon,</hi> and letting go God's Captives from thence, and restoring <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> is cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly typical of Christ's destroying mystical <hi>Babylon,</hi> and delivering his People from her Tyranny, and gloriously building up the spiritual <hi>Ierusalem</hi> in the latter Days; so God's preparing <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Way, by drying up the Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver <hi>Euphrates,</hi> is spoken of in Terms like those that are used in those Prophecies that have been mentioned, to signify the preparing Christ's Way, when he shall come to accomplish the latter Event. Thus God says concerning <hi>Cyrus,</hi> Isai. xlv.2. <hi>I will go before thee, and</hi> MAKE CROOKED PLACES STRAIGHT. And Ver. 13 <hi>I will direct,</hi> or <hi>make straight</hi> (as it is in the Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin) <hi>all his Ways.</hi> This is like Chap. xl.2, 4. <hi>Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare ye the Way of the Lord; make straight in the Desart an Highway for our God.—The crooked Things shall be made straight.</hi> Chap. xlii.16. <hi>I will make Darkness Light before them, and crooked Things straight.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>If any should object against understanding the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> in <hi>Rev.</hi> xvi.12. as signifying what has been supposed, that when mention is made of the River <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates,</hi> in another Place in this Prophecy, 'tis manifest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly not so to be understood, <hi>viz.</hi> in Chap. ix.14. <hi>Say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the sixth Angel which had the Trumpet, Loose the four Angels which are bound in the great River</hi> Euphrates: and that there is no Reason to understand the River <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> in the Vision of the sixth Vial, as signifying
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:005938_0173_0000000000000000"/>
something diverse from what is meant by the same River in the Vision of the sixth Trumpet:</p>
            <p>I answer, That there appears to me to be good Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son for a diverse understanding of the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> in these two different Places: The Diversity of the Scene of the Vision, and of the Kind of Representation, in those two divers Parts of this Prophecy, naturally leads to it, and requires it. It is in this Book as it is in the old Testament: When the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> is spoken of in the old Testament, both in the Histories and Prophecies, it is mentioned with Regard to a two<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fold Relation of that River: <hi>viz.</hi> 1st. With Regard to it's Relation to <hi>Babylon.</hi> And as it was related to that, it was something belonging to that City, as it's Defence and Supply, as has been represented. Thus the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> is spoken of in many Places that have been already observed, and others that might be mention'd. 2dly. This River is spoken of with Regard to it's Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation to the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> God's visible People. And as it was related to that, it was it's Eastern Boundary. It is so spoken of <hi>Gen.</hi> xv.18. <hi>Exod.</hi> xxiii.31. <hi>Deut.</hi> i.7. and xi.24. <hi>Iosh.</hi> i.4. 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> viii.3. 1 <hi>Chron.</hi> xviii.3. 1 <hi>Kings</hi> iv.21. <hi>Ezra</hi> iv.20. Agreable to this diverse Respect or Relation of this River, under which it is mention'd in the old Testament, so must we understand it differently in different Parts of the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of this Book of Revelation, according as the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture and Subject of the Vision requires. In the xvi<hi>th</hi> Chap<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> where the Prophecy is about <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Vision is of God's Plagues on <hi>Babylon,</hi> preparing the Way for her Destruction, there, when the River <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrates</hi> is mention'd, we are naturally and necessarily led to consider it as something belonging to <hi>Babylon,</hi>
               <pb n="166" facs="unknown:005938_0174_0000000000000000"/>
appertaining to the mystical <hi>Babylon,</hi> as <hi>Euphrates</hi> did to old <hi>Babylon.</hi> But we can't understand it so in the ix<hi>th</hi> Chap. for there the Prophecy is not about <hi>Baby<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lon.</hi> To mention <hi>Euphrates</hi> there, as something belong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to <hi>Babylon,</hi> would have been improper; for the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of the Vision, and prophetical Representation, <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>en made to him; there is not a Word said about <hi>Babylon</hi> 'till we come to the second Part of this Prophecy, after <hi>Iohn</hi> had the Vision of the second Book, and Christ had said to him, <hi>Thou must prophesy again before Peoples, and Nations, and Kings,</hi> Chap. xi. The Scene of the Vision, in the former Part of the Prophecy, had been more especially the Land of <hi>Israel</hi>; and the Vision is concerning two Sorts of Persons there, <hi>viz.</hi> Those of the Tribes of <hi>Israel</hi> that had the Seal of God in their Foreheads, and those wicked apostate <hi>Israelites</hi> that had not this Mark. Compare Chap. vii.3,—8. and Chap. ix.4. The Vision in this ix<hi>th</hi> Chap. is of God's Judgments on those of the Tribes of <hi>Israel,</hi> or in the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> which had not the Seal of God in their Foreheads. And therefore when Mention is made, Ver. 14. of a Judgment coming on them from the River <hi>Euphrates,</hi> this River is here spoken of in the former Respect, <hi>viz.</hi> with Regard to it's Relation to the Land of <hi>Israel,</hi> as it's Eastern Border; and thereby we must understand that God would bring some terrible Calamity on Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendom from it's Eastern Border, as he did when the <hi>Turks</hi> were let loose on Christendom.</p>
            <p>If these Things that have been spoken of, are inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in the Prophecy of the sixth Vial, it affords, as I conceive, great Reason to hope that the Beginning of
<pb n="167" facs="unknown:005938_0175_0000000000000000"/>
that glorious Work of God's Spirit, which in the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress and Issue of it, will overthrow Antichrist, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troduce the Glory of the latter Days, is not very far off.</p>
            <p>Mr. <hi>Lowman</hi> has, I think, put it beyond all reason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Doubt, that the 5<hi>th</hi> Vial was poured out in the Time of the Reformation. It also appears satisfyingly, by his late Exposition, that take one Vial with another, it has not been 200 Years from the Beginning of one Vial to the Beginning of another, but about 180 Years. But it is now about 220 Years since the 5<hi>th</hi> Vial began to be poured; and it is a long Time since the main Effects of it have been finished. And therefore if the 6<hi>th</hi> Vial han't already begun to be poured out, it may well be speedily expected.</p>
            <p>But with Regard to the first Thing that I have sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed to be signified by the Effect of this Vial, <hi>viz.</hi> The drying up the Fountains and Streams of the Wealth and temporal Incomes and Supplies of the antichristian Church and Territories, I would propose it to Consi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deration, whether or no many Things that have come to pass within these twenty Years past, may not be look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon as probable Beginnings of a Fulfilment of this Prophecy. Particularly what the Kings of <hi>Spain</hi> and <hi>Portugal</hi> did some Years since, when displeased with the Pope, forbidding any thenceforward going to <hi>Rome</hi> for Investitures, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> thereby cutting off two great Streams of the Pope's Wealth, from so great and rich a Part of the popish World; and it's becoming so frequent a Thing of late for popish Princes, in their Wars, to make bold with the Treasure of the Church, and to tax the Clergy within their Dominions, as well as Lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; or, which is equivalent, to oblige 'em to contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:005938_0176_0000000000000000"/>
great Sums, under the Name of <hi>a free Gift</hi>; and also the late peeling and impoverishing the Pope's tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poral Dominions in <hi>Italy,</hi> by the Armies of the <hi>Austri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans, Neapolitans</hi> and <hi>Spaniards,</hi> passing and repassing through them, and living so much at Discretion in them, of which the Pope has so loudly complain'd, and in vain; receiving nothing but Menaces, when he has objected against giving Liberty for the like Passage, for the future. These Things make it hopeful that the Time is coming when the Princes of <hi>Europe, the ten Horns, shall hate the Whore, and make her desolate and na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked, and eat her Flesh</hi>; as Rev. xvii.16. which will prepare the Way for what next follows, <hi>her being burnt with Fire</hi>; even as the sixth Vial poured out, to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sume the Supplies of Antichrist, and strip him naked of his Wealth, and as it were to pick his Flesh off from his Bones, will make Way for what next follows, the seventh Vial, that will consume Antichrist by the Fierceness of God's Wrath.</p>
            <p>Besides these Things that have been already menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on'd, are also worthy to be consider'd the Things that have lately happen'd to dry up the Fountains and Streams of the Wealth of the antichristian Dominions: As, the so far ruining the Trade of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Spain,</hi> that are the two chief popish Kingdoms, the main Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of the popish Cause, and from whence the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of Antichrist has had of late it's main Supplies. The almost miraculous taking of <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> in the Year 1745. whereby was dried up one of the main Sources of the Wealth of the Kingdom of <hi>France</hi>; and the no less, but yet more wonderful Disappoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the <hi>French,</hi> in their great Attempt to repossess themselves of it, and the confounding of their great
<pb n="169" facs="unknown:005938_0177_0000000000000000"/>
               <hi>Armada,</hi> under the Duke <hi>D'Anville,</hi> by a most visible Hand of God against them, the last Year; and in now again baffling a second Attempt of our obstinate Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, this Year, by delivering up their Men of War, with their warlike Forces and Stores, in their Way to <hi>America,</hi> into the Hands of the English Admirals <hi>Anson</hi> and <hi>Warren</hi>: The strange and unaccountable con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suming of the great Magazines of the <hi>French East-In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dia</hi> Company, at Port <hi>L'Orient,</hi> with their magnificent Buildings, the last Year; and it's so wonderfully com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to pass, that scarce any Thing of the great Stores there laid up, was saved out of the Flames: The aw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful Destruction, by an Earthquake, the last Year, of that great and rich City of <hi>Lima,</hi> the Centre of the <hi>South-Sea</hi> Trade, and the Capital of <hi>Peru,</hi> the richest Countrey in the World, from whence comes more of its Silver and Gold than any other Countrey, from whence <hi>Spain</hi> is principally supplied with it's Wealth, and where the <hi>French</hi> had a great Trade; the Destruction of the City being attended with the Destruction of all the Ships in the Harbour, which were dashed in Pieces as it were in a Moment, by the immediate Hand of God; many of which were doubtless laden with vast Treasures. I might have mentioned the taking of <hi>Porto-Bello,</hi> not long before this, by a very small Force, tho' a Place of very great Strength, where the <hi>Spanish</hi> Gal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leons used principally to go, to carry the Wealth of <hi>Peru</hi> to <hi>Spain.</hi> Besides the taking from the French and Spaniards so many of their Ships, laden with vast Riches, trading to the <hi>South-Seas,</hi> the East and West <hi>Indies,</hi> and the <hi>Levant</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And here it is especially worthy of Notice, that when the <hi>French</hi> seemed to have gotten so great an Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tage
<pb n="170" facs="unknown:005938_0178_0000000000000000"/>
of the <hi>English</hi> Factory at <hi>Madrass,</hi> they were so frustrated of the Benefit and Gains they expected by it, by the Hand of Heaven against them, immediately pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>suing the Conquerors with Tempest, wrecking their Ships laden with our Spoils; and after that, delivering up into the Hands of the English their <hi>East-India</hi> Fleet, with their Stores and immense Treasures, intended for the confirming to themselves the Advantage they seem'd to have gain'd by the fore-mentioned Conquest: At the same Instant, also delivering into our Hands their strong Force intended for the regaining that great Fountain of their Wealth, which they had lost at <hi>Cape-Breton.</hi> And since that, delivering into the Hands of Sir <hi>Peter Warren</hi> so great a Part of their vast and rich Fleet from the <hi>West-Indies.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And one Thing with Relation to the taking of <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> tho' it may seem trivial, yet I don't think to be altogether inconsiderable in the present Case; and that is, that hereby the antichristian Dominions are depriv'd of a very great Part of their Fish, which makes no small Part of the Food and Support of popish Countries; their Superstition forbidding them to eat any Flesh for near a third Part of the Year. This they were sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with much more from <hi>Cape-Breton,</hi> than any Place in the World in the Possession of Papists. And the Contention of <hi>France</hi> with the <hi>Dutch,</hi> deprives 'em of most of their Supply of this Sort, which they had else<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>where. When the Prophet <hi>Isaiah</hi> foretells the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priving <hi>Egypt</hi> of it's Wealth and temporal Supplies, under the Figure of drying up their Rivers, this is par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly mention'd, that they should be deprived of their Fish. Isai. xix.4, &amp;c. <hi>And the</hi> Egyptians <hi>will I give over into the Hand of a cruel Lord.—And the Waters shall
<pb n="171" facs="unknown:005938_0179_0000000000000000"/>
fail from the Sea, and the River shall be wasted and dried up; and they shall turn the Rivers far away, and the Brooks of Defence shall be emptied and dried up.—The Fishers also shall mourn, and all they that cast Angle into the Brooks shall lament, and they that spread Nets upon the Waters shall languish.</hi> This is expressed in the Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies of drying up the Waters, i. e. the Supplies of <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt</hi>; and this probably is implied in the Prophecies of drying up the Waters of that City that is spiritually called <hi>Egypt.</hi> And it may be noted, that this is not only a Supply that the Church of Antichrist has literally out of the Waters, but is that Part of their temporal Supply which is eminently the Supply and Food of their anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christian Superstition, or which their popish Religion makes necessary for them.</p>
            <p>These Things duly considered, I imagine afford us Ground to suppose, not only that the Effect of this sixth Vial is already begun, but that some Progress is already made in it, and that this Vial is now running apace. And when it shall be finished, there is all Reason to sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose that the Destruction of Antichrist will very speedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly follow; and that the two last Vials will succeed one another more closely than the other Vials. When once the River <hi>Euphrates</hi> was dried up, and <hi>Cyrus</hi>'s Way was prepared, he delayed not, but immediately entred into the City to destroy it. Nor is it God's Manner, when once his Way is prepared, to delay to deliver his Church and shew Mercy to <hi>Zion.</hi> When once Impediments are removed, Christ will no longer remain at a Distance, but will be like a Roe or a young Hart, coming swiftly to the Help of his People. When that Cry is made<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Isai. lvii.14. <hi>Cast ye up, cast ye up, prepare the Way,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>The high and lofty One that inhabits
<pb n="172" facs="unknown:005938_0180_0000000000000000"/>
Eternity, is represented as very near to revive the Spirit of the Contrite, and deliver his People with whom he had been Wr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>th,</hi> Ver. 15, to the End. When that Cry is made Isai. xl. <hi>Prepare ye the Way of the Lord, make straight in the Desart an Highway for our God; every Valley shall be exalted,</hi> &amp;c. God tells his Church, <hi>that her Warfare is accomplished, and the Time to comfort her is come, and that the Glory of the Lord now shall be revealed, and all Flesh see it together,</hi> Ver. 1,—5. And agreably to these Things, Christ on the pouring out the sixth Vial, says, <hi>Behold I come,</hi> Rev. xvi.15. The sixth Vial is the Forerunner of the seventh and last, to prepare it's Way. The Angel that pours out this Vial is the Harbinger of Christ; and when the Harbinger is come, the King is at Hand. <hi>Iohn the Baptist,</hi> that was Christ's Harbinger, who came to level Mountains and fill up Valleys, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed, <hi>The Kingdom of Heaven is at Hand</hi>; and when he had prepared Christ's Way, then <hi>the Lord suddenly came into his Temple, even the Messenger of the Covenant,</hi> Mal. iii.1.</p>
            <p>'Tis true, that we don't know how long this Vial may continue running, and so Christ's Way preparing, before 'tis fully prepared: But yet if there be Reason to think the Effect of this Vial is begun, or is near, then there is Reason also to think that the Beginning of that great Work of God's Spirit, in reviving of Religion, which, before it is finished, will issue in Antichrist's Ruin, is not far off. For 'tis pretty manifest, that the Beginning of this Work will accompany the sixth Vial. For the gathering together of the Armies on both Sides, on the Side of Christ and Antichrist, to that great Battle that shall issue in the Overthrow of the latter, will be under this Vial; (compare <hi>Rev.</hi> xvi.12, 13, 14. with
<pb n="173" facs="unknown:005938_0181_0000000000000000"/>
               <hi>Chap.</hi> xix.11, to the End.) And 'tis plain that Christ's manifesting himself, and wonderfully appearing after long hiding himself, to plead his own and his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple's Cause, and riding forth against his Enemies in a glorious Manner, and his People's following him in pure Linen, or the Practice of Righteousness and pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, will be the Thing that will give the Alarm to Antichrist, and cause him to gather that vast Host to make the utmost Opposition. But this Alarm and ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thering together is represented as being under the sixth Vial. So that it will be a great Revival, and mighty Progress of true Religion under the sixth Vial, eminent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly threatning the speedy and utter Overthrow of <hi>Satan</hi>'s Kingdom on Earth, that will so mightily rouse the old Serpent, to ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>t himself with such exceeding Violence, in that greatest Conflict and Struggle that ever he had with Christ and the Church, since the World stood.</p>
            <p>All the seven Vials bring terrible Judgments upon Antichrist; but there seems to be something distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the three last, the fifth, sixth and seventh, <hi>viz.</hi> That they more directly tend to the Overthrow of his Kingdom, and accordingly each of 'em is attended with a great Reviving of Religion. The fifth Vial was at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with such a Revival, and Reformation, that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly weakened and diminished the Throne or Kingdom of the Beast, and went far towards it's Ruin. It seems a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> tho' the sixth Vial should be much more so; for 'tis the distinguishing Note of this Vial, that it is the <hi>preparatory</hi> Vial, which more than any other Vial prepares the Way for Christ's coming to destroy the Kingdom of Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>christ, and set up his own Kingdom in the World. A great Outpouring of the Spirit accompanied that Dispen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sation that was preparatory to Christ's coming in his
<pb n="174" facs="unknown:005938_0182_0000000000000000"/>
publick Ministry, in the Days of his Flesh: So, much more, will a great Outpouring of the Spirit accompany the Dispensation that will be preparatory to Christ's coming in his Kingdom.</p>
            <p>And besides those Things which belong to the Prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of Christ's Way, which are so often represented by levelling Mountains, drying up Rivers, <hi>&amp;c. viz.</hi> The unravelling Intricacies, and removing Difficulties attending christian Doctrines, the distinguishing between true Religion and it's false Appearances, the detecting and exploding Errors and corrupt Principles, and the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forming the wicked Lives of Professors, which have been the chief Stumbling-Blocks and Obstacles that have hitherto hindred the Progress of true Religion; I say, these Things, which seem to belong to this preparatory Vial, are the proper Work of the Spirit of God, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moting and advancing divine Light and true Piety, and can be the Effect of nothing else.</p>
            <p>And that the Beginning of that glorious Work of God's Spirit, which shall finally bring on the Church's latter-day Glory, will accompany that other Effect of this Vial, <hi>viz.</hi> The turning the Streams of the Wealth of the World, the bringing it's Treasures, and the Gains of it's Trade and Navigation, into the true Protestant Church of Christ, seems very manifest, because this very Effect is spoken of as that which shall be at the Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning of this glorious Work. Isai. lx.8, 9. <hi>Who are these that fly as a Cloud, and as Doves to their Windows? Surely the Isles shall wait for me, and the Ships of</hi> T<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  </gap>ilver and Gold with them, unto the Name of the Lord thy God, and to the holy One of</hi> Israel, <hi>because he hath glorified thee.</hi> So that 'tis to be hoped that before this Effect of this Vial,
<pb n="175" facs="unknown:005938_0183_0000000000000000"/>
which is now probably begun, is at an End, the Spirit of God will so influence the Hearts of Protestants, that they will be disposed to devote to the Service of God the Silver and Gold they take from their popish Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, and the Gains of their Trade and Navigation, both to the East and West <hi>Indies,</hi> so that <hi>their Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chandize and Hire shall be Holiness to the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Agreably to what has been supposed, that an extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Out-pouring of the Spirit of God is to accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany this sixth Vial; so the Beginning of a Work of extraordinary Awakening has already attended the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bable Beginning of this Vial; and has been continued in one Place or other, for many Years past: Altho' it has been, in some Places, mingled with much Enthu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siasm, after the Manner of Things in their first Begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, unripe, and mixed with much Crudity. But it is to be hoped, a far more pure extensive and glorious Revival of Religion is not far off, which will more pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perly be the Beginning of that Work which in it's Is<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sue shall overthrow the Kingdom of Antichrist, and of <hi>Satan</hi> through the World. But God <hi>will be enquired of for this, by the House of</hi> Israel, <hi>to do it for them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 5. If notwithstanding all that I have said, it be still judged that there is sufficient Reason to determine that the Ruin of Antichrist is at a very great Distance, and if all that I have said, as arguing that there is Reason to hope that the Beginning of that glorious Revival of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, which in it's Continuance and Progress will de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stroy the Kingdom of Antichrist, is not very far off, be judged to be of no Force; yet it will not follow that our complying with what is proposed to us in the late Memorial from <hi>Scotland,</hi> will be in vain, or not follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with such spiritual Blessings, as will richly recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence
<pb n="176" facs="unknown:005938_0184_0000000000000000"/>
the Pains of such extraordinary Prayer for the Holy Spirit, and the Revival of Religion. If God don't grant that greatest of all Effusions of his Spirit, so soon as we desire, yet we shall have the Satisfaction of a Consciousness of our having employed ourselves in a Manner that is certainly agreable to Christ's Will and frequent Commands, in being much in Prayer for this Mercy, and much more in it than has heretofore been common with Christians: And there will be all Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to hope, that we shall receive some blessed Token of his Acceptance. If the Fall of mystical <hi>Babylon,</hi> and the Work of God's Spirit that shall bring it to pass, be at several hundred Years Distance, yet it follows not that there will be no happy Revivals of Religion before that Time, that shall be richly worth the most diligent earnest and constant praying for.</p>
            <p>I would say something to one Objection more, and then hasten to the Conclusion of this Discourse.</p>
            <p>OBJECT. VI. Some may be ready to object, That what is proposed in this Memorial is a <hi>new Thing,</hi> such as never was put in Practice in the Church of God before.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Ans.</hi> 1. If there be something circumstantially new in it, this can't be a sufficient Objection. The Duty of Prayer is no new Duty: For many of God's People expresly to agree, as touching something they shall ask in Prayer, is no new Thing: For God's People to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gree on Circumstances of Time and Place for united Prayer, according to their own Discretion, is no new Thing: For many, in different Places, to agree to offer up extraordinary Prayers to God, at the same Time,
<pb n="177" facs="unknown:005938_0185_0000000000000000"/>
as a Token of their Union, is no new Thing; but has been commonly practised in the Appointment of Days of Fasting and Prayer for special Mercies. And if the People of God shou'd engage in the Duty of Prayer, for the coming of Christ's Kingdom, in a new Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, in that Respect, that they resolve they will not be so negligent of this Duty, as has been common with Professors of Religion heretofore, but will be more fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent and fervent in it; this would be such a new Thing as ought to be, and would be only to reform a former Negligence. And for the People of God in various Parts of the World, visibly, and by express A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greement, to unite for this extraordinary Prayer, is no more than their Duty, and no more than what it is fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>told the People of God should actually do, before the Time comes of the Church's promised Glory on Earth. And if this be a Duty, then it is a Duty to come into some Method to render this practicable: But it is not practicable (as was shewn before) but by this Method, or some other equivalent.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Answ.</hi> 2. As to this particular Method, proposed to promote Union in extraordinary Prayer, <hi>viz.</hi> God's People in various Parts their setting apart fixed Seasons, to return at certain Periods, wherein they agree to offer up their Prayers at the same Time, it is not so new, as some may possibly imagine. This may appear by what follows; which is Part of a Paper, dispersed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad in <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> from <hi>London,</hi> in the Year 1712, being the latter End of Queen <hi>Anne</hi>'s Reign, and very extensively complied with, entitled, <hi>A serious Call from the City to the Country, to join with them in setting apart some Time,</hi> viz. <hi>from Seven to Eight,
<pb n="178" facs="unknown:005938_0186_0000000000000000"/>
every Tuesday-Morning, for solemn seeking of God, each one in his Closet, now in this so critical a Iuncture.</hi>

            <p>
               <q>Jonah i.6. <hi>Call upon God, if so be that God will think upon us, that we perish not.</hi>
               </q>
What follows is an Extract from it.</p>
            <p>
               <q>You have formerly been called upon to the like Duty, and have complied with it; and that not without Success. It is now thought highly seasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to renew the Call. It is hoped that you will not be more backward, when it is so apparent that there is even greater Need. It is scarce imagi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nable how a professing People should stand in greater Need of Prayer, than we do at this Day. You were formerly bespoke from that very pertinent Text, Zech. viii.21. <hi>The Inhabitants of one City shall go to another, saying, Let us go speedily to pray before the Lord,</hi> or (as the marginal Reading, more) expressive of the original Reading, is,) <hi>continually, from Day to Day, to entreat the Face of the Lord.</hi> According to this excellent Pattern, we of this City, the Metropolis of our Land, think ourselves obliged to call upon our Brethren in <hi>Great Britain</hi> and <hi>Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> at a Time when our Hearts cannot but medi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate Terror, and our Flesh tremble for Fear of God, and are afraid of his righteous Judgments: Those past being for the most Part forgotten; and the Signs of the Times foreboding Evil to come, being by the Generality little, if at all, regarded: We cannot therefore but renew our earnest Request, that all who make Conscience of praying for the Peace of <hi>Ierusalem,</hi> who wish well to <hi>Zion,</hi> who would have us and our Posterity a Nation of <hi>British</hi> Protestants, and not of Popish Bigots and <hi>French</hi> Slaves, would
<pb n="179" facs="unknown:005938_0187_0000000000000000"/>
give us (as far as real and not pretended Necessity will give leave) a Meeting at the Throne of Grace, at the Hour mention'd; there to wrestle with God, for the turning away his Anger from us, for our Deliverance from the Hands of his and our Enemies, for the turning the Counsels of all <hi>Ahitophels,</hi> at Home and Abroad, into Foolishness; for Mercy to the Queen and Kingdom; for a happy Peace, or successful War, so long as the Matter shall continue undetermined; for securing the Protestant Succession in the illustrious House of <hi>Hanover</hi> (by good and evil Wishes to which, the Friends and Enemies of our Religion and civil Rights, are so essentially dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinguished,) and especially for the Influences of di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine Grace upon the rising Generation, particularly the Seed of the Righteous, that the Off-spring of our Christian Heroes may never be the Plague of our Church and Country. And we desire that this so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn Prayer be begun the first Tuesday after Sight, and continued at least the Summer of this present Year 1712. And we think, every modest reasona<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and just Request, such as this, should not on any Account be denied us; since we are not laying a Burden on others, to which we will not most wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly put our own Shoulders; nay, indeed, count it much more a Blessing than a Burden. We hope this will not be esteemed by serious Protestants, of any Denomination, a needless Step; much less do we fear being censured by any such, as fanciful and melancholy, on Account of such a Proposal.

of God's working marvellous Deliverances for his People in Answer to humble, believing and importunate Prayer; especially when Prayer and Reformation go together; which is what we desire. —Let this Counsel be acceptable to us, in this Day of the Churches Calamity, and our common Fears. Let us seek the Lord while he may be found, and call upon him while he is near. Let us humble ourselves under the mighty Hand of God. Let us go and pray unto our God, and he will hearken un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to us. We shall seek him and find him, when we search for him with all our Hearts. Pray for the Peace of <hi>Ierusalem</hi>: They shall prosper that love her. And may <hi>Zion</hi>'s Friends and Enemies both cry out with Wonder, when they see the Work of God; Behold they pray!—What hath God wrought! Verily there is a God that judgeth in the Earth.</q>

            <p>God speedily and wonderfully heard and answered those who were united in that extraordinary Prayer, proposed in the above-mentioned Paper, in suddenly scattering those black Clouds which threaten'd the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and the Protestant Interest with Ruin, at that Time; in bringing about, in so remarkable a Manner, that happy Change in the State of Affairs in the Nation, which was after the Queen's Death, by the bringing in King <hi>George</hi> the First, just at the Time when the Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies of the Religion and Liberties of the Nation had ripen'd their Designs to be put in speedy Execution. And we see in the Beginning of this Extract, this which
<pb n="181" facs="unknown:005938_0189_0000000000000000"/>
is proposed, is mention'd as being no new Thing, but that God's People in <hi>Great Britain</hi> had formerly been called upon to the like Duty, and had complied, and that not without Success. Such like Concerts or A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greements have several Times been proposed in <hi>Scotland,</hi> before this which is now proposed to us; particularly there was a Proposal published for this very Practice, in the Year 1732, and another in 1735. So that it ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears that this Objection of Novelty is built on a Mis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take.</p>

               <head>The CONCLUSION.</head>
               <p>And now, upon the whole, I desire every serious Christian, that may read this Discourse, calmly and deliberately to consider whether he can excuse himself from complying with what has been proposed to us and requested of us, by those Ministers of Christ in <hi>Scotland,</hi> that are the Authors of the late Memorial. God has stir'd up a Part of his Church, in a distant Part of the World, to be in an extraordinary Manner seeking and crying to him, that he would appear to favour <hi>Zion,</hi> as he has promised. And they are applying themselves to us, to join with them; and make that very Propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sal to us, that is spoken of in my Text, and in like Manner and Circumstances. The Members of one Church, in one Country, are coming to others, in other distant Countries, saying, <hi>Let us go speedily and constantly to pray before the Lord, and to seek the Lord of Hosts.</hi> Will it not become us readily to say, <hi>I will go also?</hi> What these Servants of Christ ask of us, is not Silver or Gold, or any of our outward Substance, or that we would put our selves to any Cost, or do any Thing that
<pb n="182" facs="unknown:005938_0190_0000000000000000"/>
will be likely to expose us to any remarkable Trouble, Difficulty or Suffering in our outward Interest; but only that we would help together with them, by our Prayers to God, for the greatest Mercy in the World; and that a Mercy which as much concerns us as them; for the Glory of their Lord and ours, for the great Advancement of our common Interest and Happiness, and the Happiness of our Fellow-Creatures through all Nations; a Mercy, which, at this Day especially, there is great Need of; a Mercy, which we in this Land do stand in particular Need of; a Mercy, which the Word of God requires us to make the Subject-Matter of our Prayers, above all other Mercies, and gives us more Encouragement to pray earnestly and unitedly to him for, than any other Mercy; and a Mercy, which the Providence of God towards the World of Mankind, at this Day, does loudly call the People of God to pray for. I think, we cannot reasonably doubt but that these Ministers have acted a Part becoming Disciples of the great Messiah, and Ministers of his Kingdom, and have done the Will of God, and according to his Word, in setting forward such an Affair at this Day, and in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing it to us. And therefore I desire it may be con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidered, whether we shall not really sin against God, in refusing to comply with their Proposal and Request,or in neglecting it, and turning it by, with but little No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice and Attention; therein disregarding that which is truly a Call of God to us.</p>
               <p>The Ministers that make this Proposal to us, are no Separatists or Schismaticks, Promoters of no publick Disorders, nor of any Wildness or Extravagance in Mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of Religion; but are quiet and peaceable Members and Ministers of the Church of <hi>Scotland,</hi> that have la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mented
<pb n="183" facs="unknown:005938_0191_0000000000000000"/>
the late Divisions and Breaches of that Church. If any shall say, that they are under no Advantage to judge of their Character, but must take it on Trust from others, because they conceal their Names; in An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>swer to this, I would say, That I presume that no so<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber Person will say that he has any Reason to suspect 'em, to be any other than Gentlemen of honest Inten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion. Be-sure there is no Appearance of any Thing else, but an upright Design in their Proposal: And that they have not mentioned their Names, is an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of it. It may well be presumed, from the Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of their expressing themselves, in the Memorial it self, that they concealed their Names from that, which perhaps may be called an Excess of Modesty; chusing to be at the greatest Distance from appearing to set forth themselves to the View of the World, as the Heads of a great Affair, and the first Projectors and Movers of something extraordinary, that they desire should become general, and that God's People in various distant Parts of the World should agree in. And therefore, they are moreover careful to tell us, that they don't propose the Affair, as now setting it on Foot, but as a Thing already set on Foot; and don't tell us who first project<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and moved it. The Proposal is made to us in a very proper <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>nd prudent Manner, with all Appearance of Christian Modesty and Sincerity, and with a very prudent Guard against any Thing that looks like Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perstition, or whatsoever might entangle a tender Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science; &amp; far from any Appearance of a Design to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote any particular Party or Denomination of Chris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tians, in Opposition to others; but will all Appea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance of the Contrary, in their charitable Request, that none would by any Means conceive of any such Thing
<pb n="184" facs="unknown:005938_0192_0000000000000000"/>
to be in their View, and that all, of all Denominations, and Opinions concerning the late religious Commotions, would join with them, in seeking the common Interest of the Kingdom of Christ. And therefore I think, none can be in the Way of their Duty, in neglecting a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posal in itself excellent, and that which they have Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to think is made with upright Intentions, meerly because the Proposers modestly conceal their Names. I don't see how any serious Person, that has an ill Opi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nion of late religious Stirs, can have any Colour of Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to refuse a Compliance with this Proposal, on that Account: The more Disorders, Extravagancies and Delusions of the Devil have lately prevailed, the more Need have we to pray earnestly to God, for his Holy Spirit, to promote <hi>true Religion,</hi> in Opposition to the grand Deceiver, and all his Works; and the more such Prayer as is proposed, is answered, the more ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectually will all that is contrary to sober and pure Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, be extirpated and exploded.</p>
               <p>One would think that every one that favours the Dust of <hi>Zion,</hi> when he hears that God is stirring up a considerable Number of his Ministers and People, to unite in extraordinary Prayer, for the Revival of Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion and Advancement of his Kingdom, should greatly rejoice on this Occasion. If we lay to Heart the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent Calamities of the Church of Christ, and long for that blessed Alteration that God has promised, one would think it should be natural to rejoice at the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of something in so dark a Day, that is so pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mising a Token. Would not our Friends that were lately in Captivity at <hi>Canada,</hi> that earnestly longed for Deliverance, have rejoiced to have heard of any Thing that seemed to forebode the Approach of their Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion?
<pb n="185" facs="unknown:005938_0193_0000000000000000"/>
And particularly may we not suppose that such of 'em as were religious Persons, would greatly have rejoiced to have understood that there was stirred up in God's People an extraordinary Spirit of Prayer for their Redemption? And I don't know why it would not be as natural for us to rejoice at the like hopeful Token of the Redemption of <hi>Zion,</hi> if we made her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terest our own, and prefer'd <hi>Ierusalem</hi> above our chief Joy.</p>
               <p>If we are indeed called of God to comply with the Proposal now made to us, then let me beseech all that do sincerely love the Interest of real Christianity, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withstanding any Diversity of Opinion, and former Disputes, now to unite in this Affair, with one Heart and Voice: And <hi>let us go speedily to pray before the Lord.</hi> There is no Need that one should wait for another. If we can get others, that are our Neighbours, to join with us, and so can conveniently spend the quarterly Seasons with praying Societies, this is desirable; but if not, why should we wholly neglect the Duty proposed? Why should not we perform it by ourselves, uniting in Heart and Practice, as far as we are able, with those who in distant Places are engaged in that Duty at that Time?</p>
               <p>If it be agreable to the Mind and Will of God, that we should comply with the Memorial, by praying for the coming of Christ's Kingdom, in the Manner therein proposed, then doubtless 'tis the Duty of all to comply with the Memorial, in that Respect also, <hi>viz.</hi> in en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavouring, as far as in us lies, to promote others join<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in such Prayer, and to render this Union and Agree<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as extensive as may be. Private Christians may have many Advantages and Opportunities for this; but
<pb n="186" facs="unknown:005938_0194_0000000000000000"/>
especially Ministers, inasmuch as they not only are by Office Overseers of whole Congregations of God's People, and their Guides in Matters of Religion, but ordinarily have a far more extensive Acquaintance and Influence abroad, than private Christians in common have.</p>
               <p>And I hope that such as are convinced that it is their Duty to comply with and encourage this Design, will remember that we ought not only to go <hi>speedily</hi> to pray before the Lord, and to seek this Mercy, but also to go <hi>constantly.</hi> We should unit<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap> in our Practice those two Things, which our Saviour unites in his Precept, <hi>Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> and <hi>not Fainting.</hi> If we should continue some Years, and nothing remarkable in Providence should appear, as tho' God heard and answered, we should act very unbecoming Believers, if we should therefore begin to be dishearten'd, and grow dull and slack, in our seek<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of God so great a Mercy. 'Tis very apparent from the Word of God, that God is wont often to try the Faith and Patience of his People, when crying to him for some great and important Mercy, by with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holding the Mercy sought, for a Season, and not only so, but at first to cause an Increase of dark Appearan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces; and yet, without fail, at last, to succeed those who continue instant in Prayer with all Perseverance, and will not let God go except he blesses. It is now proposed that this extraordinary united Prayer should continue for seven Years, from <hi>November</hi> 1746. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps some that appear forward to engage, may begin to think the Time long, before the seven Years are out; and may account it a dull Story, to go on, for so long a Time, praying in this extraordinary Method, while all yet continues dark and dead, without any Dawnings of the wish'd-for Light, or new promising Appearance in
<pb n="187" facs="unknown:005938_0195_0000000000000000"/>
Providence of the near Approach of the desired Mercy. But let it be consider'd, whether it will not be a poor Business, if our Faith and Patience is so short-winded, that we can't be willing to wait upon God one seven Years, in a Way of taking this little Pains, in seeking a Mercy so infinitely vast. For my Part, I sincerely wish and hope, that there may not be an End of extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary united Prayer, among God's People, for the Effu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of the blessed Spirit, when the seven Years are ended; but that it will be continued, either in this Method, or some other, by a new Agreement, that will be entred into, with greater Engagedness, and more abundant Alacrity, than this is; and that extraordinary united Prayer for such a Mercy will be further propa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gated and extended, than it can be expected to be in one seven Years. But yet, at the same Time, I hope, God's People, that unite in this Agreement, will see some Tokens for Good, before these seven Years are out, that shall give them to see, that God has not said to the Seed of <hi>Iacob,</hi> Seek ye me in vain; and shall serve greatly to animate and encourage 'em to go on in united Prayers for the Advancement of Christ's King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, with encreasing Fervency. But whatever our Hopes may be in this Respect, we must be content to be ignorant of the Times and Seasons, which the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther hath put in his own Power; and must be willing that God should answer Prayer, and fulfil his own glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious Promises, in his own Time; Remembring such Instructions, Counsels and Promises of the Word of God as these, Psal. xxvii.14. <hi>Wait on the Lord, be of good Courage, and he shall strengthen thine Heart; wait, I say, on the Lord.</hi> Hab. ii.3, 4. <hi>For the Vision is yet for an appointed Time; but in the End it shall speak, and
<pb n="188" facs="unknown:005938_0196_0000000000000000"/>
not lie: Though it tarry, wait for it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry.</hi> Micah vii.7. <hi>I will look unto the Lord, I will wait for the God of my Salvation: My God will hear me.</hi> Isai. xxv.8, 9. <hi>God will wipe away Tears from off all Faces, and the Rebuke of his Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple shall he take away from off all the Earth; for the Lord hath spoken it. And it shall be said in that Day, Lo, this is our God! we have waited for him, and he will save us: This is</hi> JEHOVAH! <hi>we have waited for him, we will be glad and rejoice in his Salvation.</hi> Amen.</p>
