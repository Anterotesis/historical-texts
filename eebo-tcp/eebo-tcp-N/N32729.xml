            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>THESE are the words of our bleſſed LORD and SAVIOUR JESUS CHRIST, which he ſpake to NICODEMUS, a ruler of the Jews. We have an account in the firſt part of this chapter, of his coming to Chriſt by night, and he ſeemed to be convinc'd by the miracles which Chriſt wrought of his being a teacher come from God for he ſaid unto him "Rabbi, we know that thou art a teacher come from God, for no man can do theſe miracles that thou doſt, except God be with him"; Jeſus immediately goes to preaching to him the neceſſity of the NEW BIRTH, which Nicodemus ſeemed to be altogather ignorant about? Jeſus anſwered and ſaid unto him, verily, verily, I ſay unto you, except a man be born again, he cannot ſee the kingdom of God. This was ſtrange doctrine to Nicodemus, he did not diſtinguiſh between a being born of the fleſh, and of the ſpirit; and therefore ſaith, how can theſe things be &amp;c. Jeſus goes on to demonſtrate the matter till he comes to ſpeak of the Son of man's being lifted up, as MOSES lifted up the ſerpent in the wilderneſs. A clear type of Chriſt's being lifthd up: For as thoſe that were ſtung with the firery Serpents were healed by beholding the brazon Serpent, ſo ſinners by looking or believing in Chriſt the great antitype, ſhould receive ſpiritual healing. Therefore Chriſt ſaith, as MOSES lifted up the ſerpent in the wilderneſs, even ſo muſt the Son of man be lifted up; that
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:043017_0004_101CC574E4384EF0"/>
whoſoever believeth on him ſhould not periſh, but have etrnal life, for God ſo loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whoſoever believeth in him ſhould not periſh, but have ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting life. Great love indeed; great gift indeed, That when man had broke the law of God and turned rebel, and took up arms againſt his Maker, that God ſhould have ſuch pity and compaſſion on him as to ſend his Son into the world, to take our law place and die in our ſtead, for God ſent not his Son into the world to condemn the world but that the world through him might be ſaved? And then follows the words of the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>: "He that believeth on him is not condemned" That is by faith he receives the righteouſneſs of Jeſus by which he is ſet free from the condemning power of the divine law, and ſo ſhall be eternally ſaved, "But he that believes not is condemn'd already" That is, ſentance of death contained in the law is already paſt upon him and the reaſon here for, is given in expreſs terms, becauſe he hath no believed on the name of the only begotton Son of God</p>

               <head>FIRST,</head>
               <p>I Am to ſhew how man came to be in this miſerable condition, GOD at firſt made man holy and upright, and gave him his holy and righteous law, and as long as man kept the law, he remained a happy man. But man being ſeduced and tempted by ſatan, and giving more credit to what the devil ſaid, then to what GOD ſaid, he took up with the devil's counſel, and ſo broke the law of God. Man was threaten'd with death in eaſe of diſobedience, and ſo death took place. man became ſpiritually dead, and under a ſtate of condemnation. Here infidelity firſt took place in man, by diſbelieveing the ſeverity of God, mani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſt in the law, hence he is in a ſtate of condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the law; and as there could be no way for his recovery, but by the goſpel in which Chriſt is ſet forth to be the only Saviour of ſinners, his condemnation is argmented by his diſbelieving the goſpel which is plainly demonſtrated in our Text, viz. "becauſe he hath not believed on the name of the only begotten Son of GOD."</p>
               <p>And ſo we come to the ſecond Head, which is,</p>
            </div>
            <div type="part">
               <head>SESOND.</head>
               <p>The miſery of man in this condition, whilſt in this ſtate he is a ſtranger to God: And being a ſtranger to him, he is a ſtranger to true happineſs, he is a ſtranger to peace? "There is no peace, ſaith the Lord, unto the wicked" Iſaiah. vlviii. 22. He is under a broken law and is no ways able to keep it ſo, being under a broken law, he is under all the curſes of the law, he is at enmity with God. We read the carnal mind, is enmity againſt God, not ſubject to his law, neither indeed can be, he is under the diſpleaſure of the great God, that God, that in able to ſink him to Hell in a moment, is angry with him, we read God is angry with the
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:043017_0006_101CC5790E4DB670"/>
wicked every day, a wicked man is ſpiritually a dead man, we read of his being dead in treſpaſſes and ſins: He is diſtitude of true love to God, which is that charity we read of, that a man is nothing without; he is a ſlave and captive to ſatan, we read of his being led captive by him, at his will, he ſtands at the devils beck, when he ſays go, he goeth, and when he ſays come, he cometh, he is bent upon doing evil, he hath no mind nor will to do any thing that is good; he is ſpiritually blind and ignorant, he always puts evil for good, and good for evil, light for darkneſs, and darkneſs for light.</p>
               <p>He is always taking a wrong courſe, till enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by the bleſſed ſpirit of God, he is always ſeeking after happineſs, but in a wrong way, all the powers of his mind are corrupted, his love is always ſet upon wrong objects, he loves the creature more than the Creator. He always makes a God of ſomething, beſides the liveing and true God, his will chooſes the evil, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſes the good.</p>
               <p>Chriſt ſaid, ye will not come unto me, that ye might have life. His memory forgets what it ſhould remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, &amp; remember vvhat it ſhould not: he hath a very wicked heart, we read, that the heart is deceitful and deſperately wicked, above all things, whilſt man remains out of Chriſt. He is always a ſinning in every thing he does, let men pretend to what duty they will, we read that whatſoever is not of faith is ſin. Men may pleaſe themſelves with abundance of fine Stories, about their good doings, and Miniſters may encourage them on, but every thing they do is ſin, well ſays ſome we know that wicked men coimmit a great deal of ſin but don't they do a great deal of good too, and do a great many duties. I tell you they ſin in every thing they do, for we read in the word of God, that
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:043017_0007_101CC57AC639A890"/>
whatſoever is not of faith is ſin, and without faith. it is impoſſible to pleaſe God.</p>
               <p>The duties may be good of themſelves; they may be good as to the matter of them, but bad as to the manner of them, being done out of a wrong end; being not done to the glory of God. Natural men. hath alvvays ſelf at the bottom; they have ſome ſelf ends in all that they do, they hope to paſſify God, they hope to pleaſe God, they hope to face the better in this world, or it may be they hope to get to Heaven by their do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings but this is all wrong. I don't mean to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courage men from any duty, but what I am after is to drive men off from ſelf dependence, and not have them flatter themſelves up with hopes of getting to heaven, in the way that leads to Hell; not to take pains to build on a ſandy foundation, and think that they are keeping the commands of God when at the ſame time they continue break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
               <p>For God in his word ſays, "Wheather you eat or drink, or whatſoever ye do, do all to the glory of God, but wicked men don't do all to his Glory, nor nothing at all as they ſhould do, and in this caſe ſuppoſe they could do duties without commiting ſin, what would they do with their ſins that's paſt, if they could live a hundred years without one Sin. Still they are under a broken law, and having offended the justice of God, and being under a broken law and not able to make any ſatisfaction, and altogather unable to keep the lavv.</p>
               <p>Man I ſay being in this condition is expoſed to all miſeries in this life, to death itſelf and to the pains of hell forever, if he dies in this condition.

I don't ſay but that good works are good in their place but what I ſay is, that good works are not the way to Heaven: Chriſt is the way. Good works are ſigns of a good man, but they are not means nor conditions of making a good man, and here it is that people make the grand miſtake: We read that a good man guideth his affairs with diſcretion, and ſheweth mercy and lendeth; but that don't make them good, there being good maketh them do the good works: But what I ſay is, there good works don't make them good.</p>
               <p>What are ſigns of a good man, they put for con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions to make good men, what makes men good, is being engrafted into Chriſt, by a true and living faith, that faith that works by love, and purifies the heart, and overcomes the world, and is productive of good fruit, and where this faith is, it will bear good fruit: This faith will produce good works, but the doings of good works, won't beget this faith. A good tree bringeth forth good fruit but take a bad tree, and put on everſomuch good fruit, and that won't make it a good tree; well but ſome may ſay, we don't expect that our good works will ſave us alone but we muſt do our part, and Chriſt will do his, if we do what we can, what we can't do, Chriſt will make up but that is all wrong. Chriſt will be a whole Saviour or elſe none at all; his coat was without ſeam, and his righteouſneſs won't bear piece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing. It men will but depend upon their doings the devil don't care how much they do, he is not afraid of loſing them that way: Let them build never ſo ſtately a houſe, it will fall about their ears, when the ſtorm comes, being built upon a ſandy founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion:

If you faſt twice a week, and pay ties of all that you poſeſs, and give all your goods to feed the poor, and your body to be burnt, and depend upon that to juſtify you, you may go to hell when you have done all, and leſt any ſhould ſay, that I have ſaid more then I can prove: Let us ſee what the word of God ſaith upon this head. Chriſt ſaith, "except your righteouſneſs exceed the righteouſneſs of the Scribes and Phariſees, ye ſhall in no eaſe enter into the kingdom of heaven:" Matt. v. 20. "Therefore by the deeds of the law, there ſhall no fleſh be juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied in his ſight: For by the law is the knowledge of ſin:" Rom. iii. 20. "Being juſtified freely by his grace, through the redemption that is in Jeſus Chriſt:" Rom. iii. 24. For as by one mans diſobe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience many were made ſinners: So by the obedience of one ſhall many be made righteous:" Rom. v. 19. "Knowing that a man is not juſtified by the works of the law, but by the faith of Jeſus Chriſt: for by the works of the law ſhall no fleſh be juſtified." Gal. ii. 16. "For if righteouſneſs come by the law, then Chriſt is dead in vain." Gal. ii. 21. And many places of ſcripture more, might be named to the ſame purpoſe; indeed the ſcriptures are ſo plain, that it ſeems as if every one that reads, might ſee it But may be ſome may ſay, what need is there of telling us about this: We don't think that our works will ſave us, now under the ſecond covenant: The firſt covenant was of works; but now the conditions are, faith and repentance; but this is all wrong: Faith and repentance won't ſave you, no more then good works will; no, nor they are not conditions neither. Chriſt hath ſuffered all the conditions, for all that ever will be ſaved: It is true, there never will none be ſaved without true faith, and it is likely where there is true faith, there will be true repentance<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but then what I ſay is, faith and repentance don't ſave none; they be not conditions, their is nothing that we can do as cauſes means or conditions of even our being ſaved.</p>
               <p>As I ſaid before, there will none be ſaved without
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:043017_0015_101CC592C1903520"/>
faith, God will qualify every one that he ſaves, with that qualification: For we read, "he that be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liveth ſhall be ſaved, and he that beliveth not, ſhall be damned:" For by grace are ye ſaved, through faith; and that not of yourſelves: It is the gift of God. Eph. ii. 8. It is through faith, not for faith, it is altogether for what Chriſt hath done and ſuffer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that any are ſaved. "Chriſt is the author and finiſher of faith:" How can a perſon be choſe for the having any thing, when they are choſe before they have it. We read of the elect, being choſen in Chriſt before the foundation of the world: It won't do to put faith and repentance in the room of Chriſt, no more then it will good works; if you make a God of that, you had as good make a God of any thing elſe. It ſeems as if people vvill alvvays be a build<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon ſomething vvrong, 'till they underſtand the doctrine of election, either upon vvorks, or faith, or repentance, or it may be upon their undependance, or ſomething elſe vvrong. I am afraid that people, a great many, encourages themſelves on in ſin, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending upon after repentance, but that is a poor vvay: But I ſhall ſpeak of another ſort of people, vvho ſeem to flatter themſelves, that they depend upon Chriſt to ſave them, and that they are a going in a right vvay to Heaven, and all the time as great ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners as any: They ſeem to be convinced, that they can't do any thing to ſave themſelves, they don't de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon nothing but Chriſt they ſay, to ſave them; and at the ſame time, are ſound as bad as any body: This here is vvhat vve call an Antinomean ſcheme, and vvhen a perſon comes to be beat off from a ſelf-righteous Phareſe ſcheme, or a norminon ſcheme, vvhich is one and the ſame.

he ſets them then to depending upon ſome thing they can do themſelves, and if they are brought to ſee that they can't do nothing to juſtify or help themſelves, then the devil tells them that they had no need do any thing, ſo if one ſuit won't do any longer, he puts that off and claps on another: And ſo he comes in a thouſand ſhapes as it were to deceive poor man, but don't let us hear any longer to the devils lies.</p>
               <p>But let us hear what the word of God ſaith, Chriſt ſaith, "Even ſo every good tree bringeth forth good fruit: But a corrupt tree bringeth forth evil fruit. A good tree cannot bring forth evil fruit: Neither can a corrupt tree bring forth good fruit:" Matt. vii. 17, 18. Now Chriſt ſaith, every good tree bringeth forth good fruit; and will any one, think to be a good tree, and not bring forth good fruit, but bad. "But if while we ſeek to be juſtified by Chriſt, we our ſelves alſo are found ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners, is therefore Chriſt the miniſter of ſin? God forbid:" Gal. ii. 17. "Know ye not that the unrighteous ſhall not inherit the kingdom of God? Be not deceived: Neither fornicators, nor idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, nor adulterers, nor effeminate, nor abuſers of themſelves with mankind, nor thieves, nor covet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners, ſhall inherit the kingd in of God:" 1 Cor. vi. 9.10. "Follow place with all men, and holineſs, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out which no man ſhall ſee the Lord." Heb. xii. 14. All that are ever ſaved will be made holy; they want to be made happy for being made holy: But juſtification and ſanctification always go toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, they are two links which always go together in one chain, they never are ſeparated. Chriſt ſaves his people from their ſins, and not in their ſins; "and thou ſhalt call his name Jeſus: For he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins" Matt. i. 21.

But ſin has not the dominion over them; they don't go on in wilful known ſins: Sin is their burden and ſorrow, I don't ſay but that a good man may be left to fall: Peter fell, but then he wept bitterly. And ſo I believe if any true chriſtian is left to fall, it will coſt them ſorrow. Sin is their grief and hatred: It is folly for any to pretend to have faith, and at the ſame time, go on in a courſe of wicked<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.

What a dreadful diſapoint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it will be for people that look for light, and flatter themſelves with hopes of going to Heaven, and at laſt find themſelves miſtaken, when their feet come to ſtumble upon the dark mountains. Where will the hope of the hypocrite be, when God taketh away his ſoul.

O be exalted in time, to examine yourſelves, the Apoſtle ſaith, examine your ſelves, whether ye be in the faith, prove your own ſelves, how that Jeſus Chriſt is in you, except ye be reprobates, but it ſeems as if a great many pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors might know without much examination, that Jeſus Chriſt is not in them. Jeſus Chriſt was of a meek, lowly, humble forgiving temper and diſpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition:

Chriſt ſaith, "Father forgive them for they no not what they do." But how many is there that profeſs to be chriſtians that can't overlook an injury, they are as ready to revenge as any body, they are as proud, lofty, and as worldly as other peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, nay, is not there ſome that will ſteal and ſwear, whore and get drunk: Is not there ſome that will lie, cheat, and take advantage of their neighbours. But "wo unto him that buildeth his houſe by unright<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eouſneſs, and his chambers by wrong; that uſeth his neighbours ſervice without wages, and giveth him not for his work:" Jer. xxii. 23. Is there not many think ye, that will go the rounds of duty, they will be very conſtant to meeting, come up to the or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, pray in their families, paſs for moral ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſt folks, they will pretend to a great deal of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, and perhaps of love to the brethren, but at the ſame time, are ſo covetous and ſelfiſh, that they would not give five ſhillings to ſave a poor brother from ſuffering: But true religion don't conſiſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>together in theſe duties that I mentioned, yet I am not a pleading againſt any of theſe duties. See what the apoſtle James calls pure religion: James i. 27. "Pure religion and undefiled before God and the Father, is this, To viſit the fatherleſs and widows in their affliction, and to keep himſelf un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpotted from the world." "Is not this the faſt that I have choſen? To looſe the bands of wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs, to undo the heavy burdens, and to let the oppreſſed go free, and that ye break every yoke? Is it not to deal thy bread to the hungry, and that thou bring the poor that are caſt out, to thy houſe?

Chriſt ſaith, he that is not againſt us, is on our part, there is no ſtanding nuter, and it is a dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful thing to fight under the devils banner: He is a hard maſter, and there is no way of eſcape from him, but by being redeemed by Jeſus Chriſt; but may be ſome may ſay, I am ſuch a great ſinner, I dare not come to Chriſt before I grow better. Why, that is juſt as if a man that is very ſick ſhould ſay, I am ſo ſick that I dare not ſend for a doctor, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore I grow better? Why, as long as you are out of Chriſt, you never grow no better, but are always growing worſe, there is nothing you can do that ever make you any better, if you are a ſinner, you are juſt ſuch a one as Chriſt came to ſave. Chriſt ſaid that he came not to call the righteous, but ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners to repentance: But don't underſtand that I think that you can come to Chriſt in your own ſtrength, or of yourſelf, for Chriſt ſaith: "No man can come to me, except the father which hath ſent me, draw him:" John vi. 44. It muſt be by the Almighty power of God, if you are brought home ſavingly to Jeſus Chriſt. We read, that Gods people ſhall be willing in the day of thy pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er," Pſa. cx. 3. "Chriſt is the author and fini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſher of our faith," Heb. xii. 2. "For it is God which worketh in you, both to will and to do of his good pleaſure," Phil. ii. 13. Well but ſome may ſay one thing and ſome another, ſome ſay by works we muſt be ſaved, and ſome ſay by faith and repentance, and ſome ſay by Chriſt alone: Some ſay one denomination is right, and ſome ſay ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; ſome miniſters hold one way, and ſome ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther; well, let the word of God deſide all diſputes of this ſort, leave it out to that, and what that ſays will ſtand good forever: What God ſays is always right. Let God be true and every man a liar, and let his word be your only rule; Chriſt ſaid, "ſearch

the Scriptures, for in them ye think ye have eternal life, and they are they which teſtifie of me," John v. 39. But in the next place, I ſhall ſpeak a few words to another ſort of people, and it is to thoſe who are redeemed out of this eſtate of condemnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; to thoſe who were made willing in the day of God's power; to thoſe who have had a true faith wrought in them, by the Almighty power of God, that have been ingrafted into Chriſt, by a true and living faith: And what ſhall I ſay to you: O that I knew what words to uſe, that might be any means of ſtiring any up to a greater reſolution in ſerving and glorifing God. And Oh! Chriſtian be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>horted to conſider what a dreadful condition you are delivered out of, and what a happy condition you are brought into; and conſider how it was that you was freed, and who it was that redeemed you out of that dreadful condition, and be exhorted to be humble, be not high minded, don't be lifted up in your own conceit; you know that it was no goodneſs of your own, none of your own doings, but by the free grace of God that ever you was freed; the apoſtle Paul ſaith, "for who maketh thee to differ from another?

The world is divided into two kingdoms, Chriſt's kingdom, and ſatans; and how active and diligent does the devils army ſeem to be: O! it ſeems as if chriſtians in this day, had need to be aſhamed, to ſee thoſe that have ſuch a hard maſter, ſo buſy

It is all of free grace: It was free grace in God, to contrive the plan of man's redemption: And it was free grace in Chriſt, to come and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dertake in man's room and ſtead; and it is the free grace of God, to enable any by his bleſſed ſpirit, to believe in Chriſt, with a true and liveing faith: And it is the ſame free grace to enable any to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſevere in the way of well doing; and it is the ſame free grace, to receive any home to glory.

When ſinners ſee thoſe that profeſſes religion, do that, that is not right, they are apt to conclude, that there is nothing in reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, the world is always a watching for your halt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, their eyes are always upon you. Chriſt ſaith, "Ye are the light of the world, a city that is ſet on an hill, cannot be hid: Neither do men light a candle, and put it under a buſhel: But on a can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dleſtick, and it giveth light unto all that are in the houſe. Let your light ſo ſhine before men, that they may ſee your good works, and glorifie your Father which is in Heaven:" Matt. v. 14, 15, 16. Some people ſay, they don't care what folks ſay about them; but that is wrong, for we are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded to cut off accaſion from thoſe that ſeek accaſion, and to abſtain from all appearence of evil: Indeed if we don't give people no juſt accaſion to talk, let them talk, and indeed chriſtians can't ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pect no other, but to be talked about, and perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, for we read, and all that will live godly in Chriſt Jeſus, ſhall ſuffer perſecution," 2 Tim. iii. 12. And Chriſt ſaid, marvel not if the world hate you. for you know it hated me, before it hated you if ye were of the world, the world would love it's own, but becauſe I have choſen you out of the world, therefore the world hateth you.</p>
               <p>But what I ſay is, chriſtians ſhould be very care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful how they give people any cauſe to talk about them, they ſhould take care how they become ſtum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling blocks to others: A profeſſor by his bad con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct, may become a ſtumbling block, both to ſaints and ſinners, a ſinner is apt to ſay, ſee their is ſuch a one pretends to be a chriſtian, but I don't ſee but he is as bad as any body, and ſo they are apt to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clude, that religion is nothing but a name, and chriſtians I believe are many times kept off from their duty, by the bad practices of ſome that profeſſes ſuch or ſuch a way, they are apt to ſay I can't think

that ſuch a way is right, there is ſuch a one that profeſſes that way, that will do ſo and ſo: But let me cauſion all, both ſaints and ſinners, not to judge no more after this ſort, for this is a wrong way, the bad practices of thoſe that profeſs religion, never makes that religion, is wrong; religion is the ſame, let who will profeſs it. It never makes no right way to be wrong, by bad peoples profeſſing of it: Nor it never made nor never will make any wrong way to be right.

It would not have done for the reſt of the diſciples to have ſaid, if this Judas follows Chriſt, we won't: If they could have known juſt what a man Judas was, and juſt how bad he would do: Nor it did not make that Chriſt was wrong. Peter's denying of him, tho' I don't ſcruple, but what the reſt of the diſciples was twited many a time, by their brother Judas, if not by their brother Peter too, tho' Peter was a good man, and had repentance given him, tho' I don't aſſert it that they ever were twited by them, becauſe I don't know as we have any account of it in the ſcripture: And ſince I have ſpoke of one ſtumbling block there ſeems to be ſome more come in my mind, which people ſeem to ſtumble over in this day, partly much as the Jews did, tho' it ſeems to be off of the buſineſs that I undertook, yet per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may not be altogether a miſs, and one thing is, if any one that is diſpiſed by people in general, and called a poor ignorant perſon: If any ſuch one is brought to underſtand any thing about religion, and to ſpeak of the things of God; people think it ſtrange, they can't ſuppoſe that ſuch a one knows much, they can't think but that ſuch a great man, or learnt man, or good miniſter ſhould know better then theſe poor ignorant ones: Strange ſay they, if ſuch a good man, and ſuch a good miniſter don't know what way is right, juſt like the old Jews, they ſaid, "have any of the rulers, or of the Phariſees

"Chriſt thanked his Father, that he had hid theſe things from the wiſe and prudent, and haſt revealed them unto babes:" Matt. xi, 25. And we read, that not many wiſe, not many mighty, not many noble are choſen, but the poor mean and diſpiſed, and things that are not to bring to nought, things that are, it ſeems as if the Rulers and the Phariſees, the great men of the nation had believed on Chriſt, that the common people would not a ſcrupled it's being the Chriſt, they might ſay if this is the Chriſt that was provified of by the Prophets: Strange, that the Prieſt. Scribes and Phariſees that read ſo much, have not found it out, we poor people have to work for our living, we have not ſo much time to read and ſtudy the ſcriptures, but we muſt truſt to their ſay, that know better then we: And ſo it ſeems as if a great many people in this day ſeem to truſt too much to what others ſay and do, and not ſearch for themſelves as they ought to do: They ſay, there is good Mr. ſuch a one, and ſuch a good Miniſter, that ſaith, ſuch a way is right, and ſuch a Miniſter is a learnt man, and he knows better then we: But let whoever hears or reads theſe lines, be perſuaded to ſearch the ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures, and ſee for yourſelves. Don't pin your faith upon no man's ſleave. The Scribes and the Phariſees were miſtaken, and why is not great and learnt men in our days, as liable to miſtakes as they. It ſeems if Chriſt had a come in great worldly grandour, and choſen the Scribes and Pha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſees, for his diſcipels and followers and conform<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the cuſtoms and traditions of the people. Then the people would fall in with him faſt enough; but Chriſt choſe poor fiſhermen<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and unlearn't, men to be his diſciples: So the Jews ſaid, this people who know not the law, are acurſed; and ſo people in this day, a great many ſeem to think, that no man has any right to preach

without he his college learnt, and will conform to all the traditions of the times; but ſuch people are very much miſtaken, for Chriſt will ſend by whom he pleaſes, and the word of God is a ſufficient rule, for every one of his miniſters to go by, as well as for other men, let the faſhions, and the traditions of men, be what they will.</p>
               <p>But I muſt return and ſpeak a few words to true believers, and ſo conclude. And O! Chriſtian be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liver, conſider what a great price, Chriſt paid for your redemption, to redeem you out of the dreadful eſtate of condemnation, which we have been a ſpeeking of, which all mankind were plunged into by their ſins: And let a conſideration of this, quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en you to love, fear and obey, and honor him as long as you live, and ſtrive to keep all his command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. The chief Captain told Paul in another caſe, with great ſum he obtained this freedom, but it was with a great ſum indeed, that Chriſt ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained freedom for all his; and let us conſider ſomething of what he went through, he left his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther's boſom, came down into this lower world, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcended to be born of a Virgin, and when he was firſt born, his beſt lodging was a manger; and when he grew up, and came upon his public miniſtry, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold what a treatment he met with from man, when going about up and down in the world, taking ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny a wearriſome ſtep, always a doing ſome good to the ſoul or bodies of men. We never read of his doing any hurt to any one: When his diſciples ſpoke of calling for five from Heaven, he rebuked them, and ſaid, ye know not what manner of ſpirit ye are of, for ſays he, the ſon of man did not come to deſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>troy mens lives, but to ſave them: But ſee what treatment he met with from a wicked world; he was received, contridicted and falſly accuſed, he became poor, that we through his poverty might be made rich. He ſaid, "the Foxes have holes, and the birds of the air have neſts, but the Son of Man hath not were to lay his head." He was diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſed and rejected of men, a man of ſorrow, and
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:043017_0026_101CC5B4599898D8"/>
acquainted with grief. Iſaiah. liii. 3. And now, let us follow him to the garden, and there, being in agony, he ſweats, as it were great drops of blood, falling down to the ground: And then he was taken, led away to the high prieſt, and there he was mocked at, and ſpit upon, blind folded and beaten: He was betrayed by one diſciple, denyed by another, and forſaken by all? And now, behold him brought before PILATE, falſe accuſed and then ſcourged, crowned with thorns and beaten<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and after all nailed to the CROSS, there to ſpill his precious blood.</p>
               <p>And how hard hearted and cruel was his mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derers, when he was thirſty, they gave him vinegar, to drink, and beſides all this that he underwent in his body; Oh! who can think or tell what he under went in his ſoul; he being in the low place of man, and bearing the puniſhment that was due to poor ſinners to ſatisfy the juſtice of GOD. He muſt bear puniſhment both in his ſoul and body. He tells his diſciples in the garden, that his ſoul was exceeding ſorrowful, even unto death; and on the CROSS he cry'd out, my God my God, why haſt thou forſaken me, it ſeems as if what he underwent in his ſoul, haſtened him to his death, it ſeems by what we read, that he died before thoſe that were crucified with him: For when the ſoldiers came and broke the legs of thoſe that were crucified with him. When they came to him and ſaw that he was already dead, they broke not his legs. And now, can you find in your heart to ſin againſt ſuch a good and kind God, that hath done ſo much for you. Be exhorted O believer, to meditate much upon what Chriſt hath done and ſuffered to redeem and ſave you, and when tempted to any ſin, ſay as Joſeph did, "How can I do this great wickedneſs and ſin againſt God," and ſtrive to do your duty in all things, and have regard to all God's commands and not think that there is any of them ſo ſmall as to be overlook't. Some may ſay, you tell us about
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:043017_0027_101CC5B5E5960A30"/>
keeping the commands, and doing our duty, but you don't tell us what our duty is, ſome ſay one thing is duty, and ſome ſay another, ſo we are at a loſe, to know what duty is; we ſhould be glad to keep the commands of God, if we knew what they were; well, the beſt advice that I can give you is. to ſtudy the word of God, and pray to him to teach you your duty, by his word and ſpirit, and enable you to do it, and what God ſaith in his word, that obſerve, let men ſay what they will: Whenever their is a contridiction amongſt people, about what is duty, let your enquiry be what ſaith the ſcripture, and let that decide all matters of that ſort, and let Chriſt be all in all unto you, and pray God to teach you his will, and enable you to do it, for it is God that worketh in you, both to will and to do, for of him and through him, and to him are all things, to whom be glory forever, AMEN.</p>
