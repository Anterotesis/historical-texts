            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <epigraph>
               <bibl>GENESIS XIV. 14.</bibl>
               <q>
                  <hi>And when Abram heard that his Brother was taken captive, he armed his trained Servants, born in his own Houſe, three Hundred and eighteen, and purſued them unto Dan.</hi>
               </q>
            </epigraph>
            <p>THESE Words teach us, the wiſe foreſight of holy Abram, in training his ſervants to the uſe of arms, in a time of pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>found quiet, when all was peace and ſerene; left he and all his, ſhould fall an eaſy prey to the ambition or avarice of his enterprizing neighbours. Here alſo we perceive the alert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Abram, when he heard that his brother was taken captive, he immediately arms his ſervants and takes the field with his little band;
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:013276_0005_0F9049E70087D188"/>
in which his pious benevolence to his oppreſſed kinſman ſhines; he does not delay or heſitate, but is alive and in action; he not only arms his ſervants, but puſhes forward to Dan. The courage and faith of Abram is not leſs con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpicuous, in this enterprize, when we recollect, from our context, that the army, which capti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated his kinſman, was now fluſhed with uninter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rupted ſucceſs, in waſting the neighbour coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries, vanquiſhing five kings in the vale of Sid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dim; this army was not only numerous, but uſed to battle and conqueſt: In this view, Abram's courage and faith equals almoſt any<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>thing on ſacred record, in purſuing ſuch an army, with his three hundred and eighteen raw ſoldiers, however well diſciplined; but moved with faith and a deſire to defend the rights of human nature, he purſues them to Dan.</p>
            <p>Still our context furniſhes us with a notable ſtroke of Abram's conduct, in which he ſhews his ſkill and prudence, as a general, in dividing his little band, that they might appear the more formidable, and in attacking them by night, which added ſurprize and concealed the ſmall<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his numbers; and God crowned this attempt with ſucceſs, ſo that he ſmote and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued this powerful army, and recovered the ſpoil and captives out of their hands.</p>
            <p>Yet again, Abram is more illuſtrious in the other part of his conduct, who now being fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nished
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:013276_0006_0F9049E8505DAAB0"/>
with rich ſpoils, and revered for his glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious and ſurprizing victory over theſe powerful kings, had now an opportunity to ſet himſelf up for a king, and enſlave his fellow-men in that part of the world; like Nimrod, who, being a mighty hunter, takes the occaſion from his ſkill and ſucceſs in killing beaſts, to ſet up for a king: But we behold Abram ſhining in his juſtice, generoſity and mercy to the king of Sodom, in reſtoring to him both ſpoil and captives; and his humility ſhines alſo in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring into private life, thereby manifeſting his deſign, in training his ſervants, to be a defence of human rights, and not a ſcheme to aggran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dize or enrich himſelf. In theſe parts of his conduct Abram far excels <hi>Alexander,</hi> whoſe glory roſe from his art and ſucceſs in depriving men of their natural rights: But the glory of the Patriarch Abram, as a victorious general, was his defending and reſtoring thoſe rights to his fellow-men and brethren.</p>
            <p>From this bright and ſtriking example of the illuſtrious Abram, who is the father and pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of believers, we ſee it is lawful and ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary for Chriſtians to be trained in the uſe of arms.</p>
            <p n="1">I. It appears from the pious and excellent example of this holy Patriarch Abram, as father and pattern of all believers, to the end of the world, that it is lawful for Chriſtians, as his
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:013276_0007_0F9049E871698940"/>
children, to learn the art of war and uſe of arms, for their defence, when the caſe requires it, as did Abram. Here notice, this uſe of arms is only lawful from Abram's example, when, like Abram, it ſerves the defence of human rights, or deſtroys ſuch who are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy to live, by reaſon of their conduct towards God or man; but is not lawful for the purpoſes of avarice and ambition, by which human rights are ſwallowed up. This did not Abram.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The ſmile of Providence on this conduct of Abram, in purſuing and ſmiting theſe four kings, with his handful of trained ſervants, gives reaſon to believe, that this expedition was of God, as it is recorded in another caſe, <q>for there fell down many ſlain, becauſe the war was of God.</q> I Chron. v. 22.</p>
            <p n="3">3. The lawfulneſs for Chriſtians to learn and improve the art of war, may be fairly collected from the anſwer of John, the forerunner of Chriſt, who came to prepare the way for the goſpel kingdom: When <q>the ſoldiers likewiſe demanded of him, ſaying, and what ſhall we do? And he ſaid unto them, do violence to no man, neither accuſe any falſely, and be content with your wages.</q> Luke iii. 14.</p>
            <p>In this anſwer, the goſpel Elias, who came to prepare the way of the Lord, and make
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:013276_0008_0F9049E956D07828"/>
his paths ſtraight, does not give the leaſt inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation that the calling of ſoldiers was unlawful, or that the goſpel kingdom, now at hand, would render ſuch an employment uſeleſs, or ſinful; although ſuch an intimation ſeems to be unavoidable (in faithfully anſwering the queſtion propoſed) if the art of war, and em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployment of ſoldiers under the goſpel were unlawful and ſinful. Here the argument is not to be ſuſpected, on the ſuggeſtion, that John might either want courage or faithfulneſs in this anſwer: The known character of John, as reſembling or being the goſpel Elias, in his faithful and bold reproofs, refutes this ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſtion; and this was manifeſt, not only in his reproving cruel Herod, but in pointing out to the ſoldiers the reigning vices, which ſeem to be entailed on <hi>ſtanding armies,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>violence, falſe accuſation,</hi> and <hi>diſcontent with wages;</hi> the demonſtration of which we have ſadly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perienced in this Land. Hence, from John's anſwer, we may conclude the art of war or buſineſs of ſoldiers is lawful for Chriſtians.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The lawfulneſs of acquiring art in war, by a chriſtian people, may be ſtrictly proved from the nature and reaſon of things. For if it be in the nature and reaſon of things lawful for Chriſtians to enjoy their lives, liberties and property, it muſt be lawful, in the ſame nature and reaſon of things, to uſe the means neceſſary to defend and preſerve theſe enjoyments; for
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:013276_0009_0F9049EA08B6FCD0"/>
to ſuppoſe a right to life, liberty and property, and no right to the means neceſſary for the defence and preſervation of the ſame, is one of the greateſt abſurdities in nature. Therefore, in the proceeding view of this point, we may ſurely conclude, it is lawful for Chriſtians to learn and uſe the art of war, for their own defence and ſafety, and the defence and ſafety of others, as the caſe ſhall require.</p>
            <p>The ſecond thing before us was, to point out the neceſſity for Chriſtians, or a chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, to be trained in the uſe of arms.</p>
            <p n="1">1. This neceſſity may be fairly pointed out, by conſidering the common ſhare Chriſtians have with others in human rights and privileges. It being a part of a reaſonable creature, and neceſſarily belongs to his character as ſuch, to preſerve his life, liberty and property, by all lawful means; then all the proper and lawful means for this end, are neceſſary, for all who ſhare in theſe common rights of human nature; for nothing is more diſagreeable to common ſenſe, then to ſuppoſe a right to any thing, as belonging to human nature, or men in general, and yet to ſuppoſe it unneceſſary to uſe the proper means to preſerve this right. Hence it appears needful for Chriſtians to uſe the art of war as a part of their natural, and ſo neceſſary defence; ſeeing they loſe none of their natural rights by becoming Chriſtians. Now, if any
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:013276_0010_0F9049EAC16B24D8"/>
ſhould allow, that it belongs to men, as men, to uſe all the proper and lawful means to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve their natural rights, and as ſuch they may uſe the art of war; but allow not the neceſſity or propriety for Chriſtians to uſe this means of ſelf-preſervation; this is in effect to deny that the common rights of men are allowed and neceſſary for Chriſtians; one of the moſt ſtrange poſitions ever deviſed by mortals.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The neceſſity for a chriſtian people to learn the art of war riſes into view, when it is conſidered as the only ſure check on deſigning and ambitious rulers, who are ſo often attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to enſlave and oppreſs thoſe for whoſe good they are advanced to power and authority, and only can be awed by the evidence that the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are uſed to the art of war, and therefore have it in their power to right themſelves, when the caſe requires it. In this light, the uſe of arms, kept up and underſtood among a chriſtian people is neceſſary and vaſtly important, as a re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraint or check on aſpiring and wicked rulers: For the beſt civil conſtitution in the world will not reſtrain ſuch rulers, whilſt they have nothing to fear from the power of the people: And what power is there in the people for ſuch to fear, without ſkill in war? Truly none. In this view, the art of war, for a chriſtian people, to preſerve their own natural, civil and religious rights, is moſt neceſſary and important; without
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:013276_0011_0F9049EB8C66AAD8"/>
which they may not reaſonably expect to enjoy, or tranſmit to poſterity, their common rights, as a free people; freedom cannot long continue where the authority of the people is loſt. All nations and paſt ages bear witneſs to this truth by ſad experience. Thus, if we turn our eyes to thoſe countries where tyranny reigns, we ſhall ſee the power of the people loſt, and the ſkill in arms confined to a few mercenaries, as tools to their princes; and by this method lordly power diſpoſes all things according to the will of the prince; which may kind heaven forbid ever being our lamentable caſe!</p>
            <p n="3">3. This neceſſity, for a chriſtian people being trained in the uſe of arms, is alſo pointed out by the certainty that earth and hell are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bined to perſecute the people of God. See the Apoſtle's declaring this matter, <q>But as then he that was born after the fleſh perſecuted him that was born after the ſpirit, even ſo it is now.</q> Gal. iv. 29. <q>And when the dragon ſaw that he was caſt unto the earth, he per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecuted the woman which brought forth the man-child.</q> Rev. xii. 13. This rage and combination of earth and hell againſt God's true people renders the art of war neceſſary for true Chriſtians, as a means to preſerve them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves from the perſecuting fury of evil men, moved with the rage of the old dragon. It is a moſt apparent truth, that in all caſes, the
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:013276_0012_0F9049ED89B57940"/>
means of preſervation ought in wiſdom and prudence to be proportioned to the real danger a people are in. Hence, the more and ſtronger are their enemies, the greater is the neceſſity for a chriſtian people to be ſkilled in the art of defence.</p>
            <p n="4">4. The abſolute neceſſity for a chriſtian peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple to learn the art of war opens to our ſight, if we only recollect, that without it, a people are in ſuch a defenceleſs ſtate, that their wealth does but expoſe them, by encouraging and tempting their ambitious or covetous neighbours to make them a prey; which has often been the caſe. And to prevent this, and other evils, no doubt Abram trained his ſervants to the uſe of arms. And beſides, the experience of all na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in times of war, fully diſcovers, that neither numbers nor courage, without order and art, are ſufficient to protect a nation or people.</p>
            <p>This has been remarkably verified in the empire of Ruſſia; where they neither wanted courage nor numbers, but art in war; there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore were eaſily vanquiſhed by a handful of well-diſciplined Swedes, until they acquired art in war, by which they recovered themſelves, and are now eſteemed and revered by their neighbours, and perhaps as good ſoldiers as any in the world, having of late done ſuch things in arms, againſt the Turks, as will make them

famous <hi>in ages to come.</hi> In this light, the neceſſity of learning the art of war, for our own defence, ſtrongly urges itſelf upon us.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The ſixth command of the decalogue, "Thou ſhalt not kill," lays this neceſſity pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erfully upon the people of God. For, if they may not be guilty of ſhedding their own blood, or the blood of others, they muſt uſe all proper means to preſerve their own lives, and the lives of others, or elſe be acceſſory to their own deſtruction: Now then let Chriſtians ſee and feel the neceſſity of acquiring the art of war, in obedience to God's command, and out of regard to their natural, civil and religious rights, and for ſelf-preſervation, and for the preſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their deareſt<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> friends and moſt important enjoyments, on earth or in heaven; that in doing this they may have conſciences void of offence toward God and man.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The enemies of God's church in the world, that ſurround his people, acquiring the uſe of arms, render it neceſſary for the people of God to be trained in like ſkill. Thus we hear holy king David lamenting over Saul and his ſons, who fell by the archers on the moun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains of Gilboa, and, <q>He bade them teach the children of Judah the uſe of the bow.</q> Now then, in imitation of king David, we may ſay, let the children of New-England learn the uſe of the firelock, leſt their brave commanders fall by the art of her enemies, on her pleaſant
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:013276_0014_0F9049EE9352DE70"/>
mountains, in ſome future day; when, like David, too late to ſave our brave leaders, we bade teach the uſe of fire-arms, and art of war.</p>
            <p>Finally, it appears as neceſſary for a chriſtian people to know and uſe the art of war, for their ſecurity, as it is to know and uſe the art of huſbandry for their ſupport in life: And it is as reaſonable to expect, in ordinary caſes, our proviſion without labour, as our protection without the art of war, or ſkill in arms. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause God is able to defend his people, without art in war, ſhall we be careleſs, and take no pains to learn the ſkill of defence? We might as well argue, becauſe God is able to provide for his people without work, and ſometimes has doneit, asin the wilderneſs; therefore we may be idle and commit ourſelves to Providence: Such reaſoning is unworthy of men, or Chriſtians. In this ſhort view of the neceſſity for a religious people to learn and improve the arts of war, for their protection; and the importance of this art increaſing as a people increaſe in wealth and riches, in fine fields, and fair buildings, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deniable. Otherwiſe, the increaſe or growth of a people will be but the ſtronger temptation, and richer prey, for ſome aſpiring or covetous Nimrod, ſkilled in the art of war. And it is likely to be our caſe in this land, at no great diſtance of time, if we do not, like Abram, train our houſeholds for war, in a time of profound peace and quiet.

Now we may cloſe this diſcourſe by a few obſervations.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is to be obſerved, although it be moſt evidently lawful for a chriſtian people to learn and uſe the art of war, yet it is only ſo with regard to lawful war, which is for the defence and recovery of human rights, or as an act of bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volence to human creatures, and in obedience to the immediate command of God, in executing his juſt vengeance on the wicked. The art of war, as now uſed, to rob and enſlave nations, and deprive them of their liberty and property, in order to aggrandize others, is a moſt vile and ſinful abuſe of human ſkill or art, and ought to be conſidered, at this day, in that light, as a ſore judgment and ſcourge on the world.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Let it be obſerved, that the art of war is not the leſs lawful or neceſſary for the people of God, becauſe others abuſe it to deprive their fellow-creatures of their natural rights; but the more lawful and neceſſary for them, that they may be the more able to reſiſt ſuch abuſe of human art, maintain or recover their own rights; for othewiſe they would be, without a conſtant miracle, inſtantly devoured by thoſe enemies of human freedom, that dwell around them. And I hope we have none, or at leaſt but a very few, who would expect ſuch a mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raculous protection at this day. Under this obſervation we are naturally drawn to ſurvey a
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:013276_0016_0F9049EFEEE40740"/>
little the ſweets of life, the almoſt divine plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of freedom, the tender and dear relations of nature, the tents of Shem in which we dwell, the fruitful fields that ſurround us, and quiet dwellings in which we now reſt, the honeſt earnings of our hands with the ſweat of our brows, or the patrimony of our dear anceſtors. And then turn our thoughts on the gloomy proſpect of a bloody carnage of our dear coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trymen and friends, in the high places of the field, our wives and children torn from our boſoms, our lives in jeopardy every moment, our liberty turned to ſlavery, our religious aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies the glory of our land no more, our houſes and fields turned to ſtrangers! And all this loſs and miſery come upon us for our neglect to improve in the uſe of arms and art of war! With theſe thoughts, who would forbear to imitate Abram in training his ſervants, or en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the art of war, as neceſſary for a chriſtian people; and peculiarly ſo for this now flouriſhing country, that it's growing wealth, in a defenceleſs ſtate, tempt not it's enemies to lay it waſte?</p>
            <p n="3">3. Hence it is beyond diſpute, that an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt to increaſe the knowledge of arms among us, at this time, is highly commendable in itſelf, and may be of vaſt and noble conſequence, if attended with prudence and care, ſo that no occaſion may be given, juſtly to complain, that vice is encouraged and increaſed thereby.</p>

               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:013276_0017_0F9049F0CBCCE790"/>
4. The buſineſs of this day being of this nature, and a free-will offering, is to be juſtly and highly commended, if ſoberly and wiſely conducted; eſpecially, ſeeing we are in danger, otherwiſe, to loſe the uſe of arms, it being about eight years ſince the military company in this place has been regularly called upon to attend ſuch exerciſes, by the proper officers; which, no doubt, is the caſe through this whole regiment. If this ſhould continue and ſpread in other regiments all over the province, and no private care be taken, it would ſoon render our ſtate defenceleſs, in a great meaſure: But to prevent this, may the laudable temper of martial exerciſe diffuſe itſelf through all ranks in the province; and we become a regularly diſciplined, or trained ſoldiery, that none may be tempted to enſlave or ſpoil us, for a prey to themſelves.</p>
            <p n="5">5. The harmony and readineſs of ſubmiſſion to thoſe who act the part of officers on this occaſion, will put an honor on your perſons, recommend your buſineſs, and be one part of the beauty, as well as profit, in this attempt, to increaſe your acquaintance with the neceſſary art of war, and without ſuch harmony your deſign will be fruſtrated in a great meaſure, and yourſelves diſgraced.</p>
            <p n="6">6. The conduct in cloſing the day, on ſuch occaſions, will be conſidered, as your honor
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:013276_0018_0F9049F16D3929E8"/>
or diſhonor; your honor, in ſeaſonably and ſoberly returning to your reſpective families, as men who would prove that you had no ſordid and baſe purpoſes to ſerve, by your meeting together; thus your deſign will appear honeſt, ſincere and praiſe-worthy: But if, inſtead of this, you ſpend the evening following ſuch exerciſes at taverns, in drinking and the like debaſing and immoral practices, it will diſhonor your buſineſs, and give occaſion to ſpeak evil of you and your exerciſes, as a ſource of cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption, and unworthy to be encouraged by ſober men.</p>
            <p>Finally, my young brethren, I wiſh you may be good ſoldiers in the uſe of arms, for your king and country; but above all, that you may be reminded, by this day's exerciſe, of being good ſoldiers under King Jeſus; fighting againſt all ſpiritual enemies, with ſpiritual arms, for an eternal crown.</p>
