            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>IN this chapter our Saviour diſcourſes of his ſecond coming to judge the world, when all muſt appear before him, to hear and receive their final ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence. Now from the 31ſt to the 46th verſe, he tells us more plainly and particularly, how and with what wiſdom and equity, the judgment will proceed, and after ſentence is awarded according to the juſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert, or demerit of all good and bad; execution will be taken out and levelled on all accordingly, as in our text—"And theſe (the wicked) ſhall go away into ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>laſting puniſhment: but the righteous into life eternal." Theſe words are ſo plain and expreſs at firſt view, that they need but little explanation. The ſcope and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of them is, to repreſent to us the different ſtates of good and bad men in the other world, and that their
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:017829_0003_0FB81A7E60ACAB78"/>
end, or ſtate there, will be as different as their ways and doings have been here in this world, which certainly are matters of the higheſt concernment, to be well con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered by us in this our only probation ſeaſon, for one or the other of theſe ſtates which are, or will be unal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terable forever. In a word, we are plainly here taught thoſe two ſoul concerning propoſitions, viz.</p>
            <p>Propoſition firſt. THAT good men, or all the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, ſhall be eternally happy in the other world.</p>
            <p>Prop. 2d. THAT wicked men, or all the ungodly, ſhall be eternally puniſhed for their ſins in the other world.</p>
            <p>MANKIND ſeem to be willing enough to acknowledge the truth of this firſt propoſition, hoping to ſhare in the bleſſings of it; but many for want of this goſpel hope, have a great averſion to this ſecond propoſition, and are unwilling it ſhould be true, or be received for truth, that the puniſhment of the wicked ſhould be eternal, and have their objections and cavils againſt the truth of it: but it ought to be obſerved, that if the glorifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of the ſaints in heaven is eternal, ſo is the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment of them that periſh; for theſe are in exact oppoſition and ſame meaſure of time. But more of this hereafter.</p>
            <p>As the great difficulty lies with reſpect to the ſecond <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, which is denied by ſome ('tis hoped not <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> among us) I ſhall therefore begin with that
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:017829_0004_0FB81A81014D34C8"/>
firſt, and endeavour to prove that the doctrine of the eternal puniſhment of the wicked in the other world, is a true, juſt, and reaſonable doctrine, plainly and fully taught us in God's ſacred oracles. Here there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we ſhall ſhew theſe two things.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THAT it is a doctrine clearly, fully and plainly taught us by Chriſt himſelf, in the ſacred ſcriptures.</p>
            <p n="2">II. THAT it is a juſt and reaſonable doctrine, wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy the bleſſed author of it, and greatly beneficial to mankind in many reſpects, &amp;c.</p>
            <p>Prop. 1ſt. WE ſay, that this doctrine of eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards and puniſhments, is a doctrine clearly, fully and plainly taught us by Chriſt himſelf in the ſacred ſcrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures; and for the illuſtration of this, let us look back to the foundation: when God created our firſt parents innocent and holy, to warn them to continue in their obedience and fealty to God, death was threatened as the immediate conſequence of ſin, "in the day thou eateſt thereof, thou ſhalt ſurely die," or dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thou ſhalt die a continual everlaſting death. They diſobeying incured the penalty on themſelves and poſterity; and hence God determined what the effect of ſin ſhould ever be—The ſoul that ſinneth, it ſhall die—The wicked ſhall be turned into hell with all the nations that forget God. In the new Teſtament we are more fully told what hell is, viz. a lake burning with fire and brimſtone—and the ſmoke of their tor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:017829_0005_0FB81A826F6B01F0"/>
aſſendeth forever and ever; and as theſe torments are intollerable, ſo they are eternal and never ceaſing, into which our Saviour aſſures us, that the wicked ſhall be caſt in the other world. So in our text, "and theſe (viz. the wicked) ſhall go away into everlaſting puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment," and in Mat. xxviii. 41. "Depart from me ye curſed, into everlaſting fire, prepared for the Devil and his angels," chap. xviii. 8. "where the worm dieth not and the fire is not quenched"—Rev. xx. 10. "and ſhall be tormented forever and ever"—and in Mark, chap. 9. 'tis three times over, ſeverally and very pathetical<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly aſſerted by our Saviour, that "their worm dieth not and fire is not quenched." And what ſays the Apoſtle, ſpeaking of thoſe that know not God, nor obey the goſpel of his Son? Why "they ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord, and for the glory of his power." 2 Theſſ. i. 9. Now how full, how clear, how perfectly agreeing with theſe ſcriptures for affirming this doctrine, of the eternal re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards of the Godly, and eternal puniſhment of the wicked in the other world; nor can there be one text produced in all the book of God, that gives any real intimation, that the puniſhment of the wicked who continue obſtinate in ſin, to the end of this life; that the puniſhment of ſuch in the other world, ſhall ever have an end, or mittigation. The Athieſt ſays there is no God; but can never prove it. The Deiſt denies the ſcriptures of the old and new Teſtament, to be a
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:017829_0006_0FB81A83E2847CA0"/>
divine revelation from God; but can no more prove it than the Athieſt can what he affirms. And juſt ſo it is with them that deny the eternity of hell torments, they cannot prove what they would fain perſuade them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves and others to believe; but 'tis a negative propo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſition incapable of proof.</p>
            <p>Prop. 2d. WE ſay and affirm, that this is a juſt and reaſonable doctrine, worthy the bleſſed author of it, and greatly beneficial to the good and beſt intereſt of mankind in many reſpects, &amp;c. Theſe aſſertions, we ſhall endeavour to prove and make evident—and then conſider ſuch obejections, or cavils, as are, or may be made againſt this true, plain and ſcripture doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine which we aſſert.</p>
            <p>HERE then let the following arguments be ſeriouſly and impartially conſidered—as 1ſt. That the belief of this doctrine is really beneficial and neceſſary, and for the good of mankind; as 'tis a neceſſary proper check and reſtraint on the unruly luſts, corrupti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and exorbitant paſſions of mankind in this corrupt fallen ſtate. 'Tis wonderful to obſerve, what poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the world, the luſts of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life, has got of men's heart, i. e. the ſtrong appetite corrupt nature has, for indulging fleſhly pleaſures, the luſt of the eye after gain and riches, rich poſſeſſions, &amp;c. and the pride of life, i. e. the ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſatiable thirſt after honor, pomp, grandure, and a vain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>glorious
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:017829_0007_0FB81A8C77005A50"/>
life. What will not men do? What riſks wont they run? Yea, many times not ſtick at the moſt cruel and ſhameful barbarities to gratify thoſe inſatia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble cravings of carnal, corrupt nature, that muſt be o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed againſt the plain dictates of reaſon, be the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence what it will; as Jere. ii. 25. "Thou ſaideſt there is no hope: no, for I have loved ſtrangers, and after them will I go." And is it ſo? Dont mankind then ſtand in need of ſome powerful reſtraint, to check theſe ſo diſorderly luſts and paſſions, without which all manner of rapine, injuſtice and confuſion muſt take place, and men be like wolves and tygers to devour one another? Nor can any means be aſſigned ſo proper, and power to anſwer the end in this caſe, as the doc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trine of future, eternal rewards and puniſhments. Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>porary puniſhments, or evils, are too weak for anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wering theſe great ends, of reſtraining and curbing the exorbitant luſts and paſſions of carnal and corrupt nature, and that becauſe they are temporary and ſoon at an end, and the ſinner may think and purſuade him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, that he ſhall ſurely outlive theſe temporary puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, for infinite ages in bliſs and glory. But the apprehenſion of being eternally miſerable in the other world, ſtrikes a dread on human nature, and becomes a powerful reſtraint from ſin. For who can bear the thought of dwelling with devouring fire, and everlaſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing burnings, without horror? Hence how fit, how wiſe, how neceſſary and proper was it, for the good of
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:017829_0008_0FB81A8E632FC060"/>
mankind in the legiſlature, to guard and enforce obe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dience to his juſt laws, by annexing eternal rewards to the obedience of merit and demerit, ſince no other means could be powerful enough to attain the end. Nor can any thing be imagined more intolerably painful than ſuffering the violence of fire adjutated with brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone, fitly expreſſed to warn men from ſin; a metaphor frequently uſed by our Saviour, in his preaching when on earth to this end, and Apoſtles followed this ſame example in their preaching to the ſame end, for the warning and good of mankind. 2 Cor, v. 11. "Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the terrors of the Lord, we perſuade men." In a word, ſuch a reſtraint of all evil, and promoter of all peace, and promoter of all good both in church and ſtate, is this doctrine of eternal rewards and puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, (that if we had not ſo full an evidence of the truth of it as we have) yet were it to be deſired, that all men ſhould believe it, for the vaſt good, peace and benefit, both of individuals and communities.</p>
            <p n="2">II. THE belief of this doctrine will more eſpecially appear to be for the good and benefit of mankind, if we conſider the ſafety and ſupport it yields in times of trouble and danger. What have we to ſupport and comfort us, under all the hard things and evil ſufferings that befal us in this ſtate of life; (for which in many caſes we have no remedy here) but that of our Saviour, that if we ſuffer with him, that we may be glorified to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether? This is the only or principle ſupport that good
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:017829_0009_0FB81A8FE2926720"/>
men have under all the unjuſt ſufferings, evils, and hard treatment, that befal them in this life. That there is a judgment approaching on the other ſide death, when all theſe wrong things ſhall be righted, and every man receive a full and juſt reward according to what his con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct has been in this life of trial: hence that of 1 Cor. xv. 19. "If in this life only we have hope in Chriſt, we are of all men moſt miſerable." But here is the ſure remedy and cure of this evil, that God will fully con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider all the pains any of us have taken in his ſervice, or ſuffered for his cauſe, and all the difficulties which we have ſtruggled with, out of love to God; virtue and religion, and ſuch good works, ſhall be eternally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warded of grace, not of debt. Hence, "Bleſſed are the dead that die in the Lord, they reſt from their la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, and their works do follow them."</p>
            <p n="3">III. THE wiſdom and goodneſs, as well as juſtice of God, are to be ſeen and acknowledged in appointing theſe rewards and puniſhments, and making them eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal for the warning and detering men from ſin, the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>citing and encouraging men to obedience, virtue and holineſs. The primary deſign of annexing eternal pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhment to ſin, wilfully and perverſely continued in through this ſtate of life, is not to puniſh, but rather to ſave from puniſhment, by warning them of the danger, and detering men from thoſe ſinful practices, and ſuch a wicked life as ſurely brings on inevitable miſery and deſtruction at laſt. Hence the wiſdom and goodneſs of

the legiſture appear, in annexing ſuch degree of puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſin, as may over-ballance the ſtrong diſpoſiti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and temptations, men have to commit and conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in the practice of ſin. The law is good, and can never hurt us, if we dont hurt ourſelves by diſobeying of it. It lays no reſtraints upon us, but what is for our own good and benefit; nor does God threaten men, that they may ſin and be puniſhed; no, but that they may eſcape the puniſhment; therefore, the higher the threatening runs, ſo much the more mercy and good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs there is in it, becauſe it is ſo much the more like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to reſtrain them from incurring the penalty that is threatened, and if it fails of this good effect, the fault is wholly our own.</p>
            <p n="4">IV. WAS it not fit, reaſonable and neceſſary to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>force man's obedience to the laws of his Maker? That God ſhould annex ſuch rewards and puniſhments as were fit and proper to anſwer that end, and their be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing made eternal was neceſſary to anſwer that end, even by the repeated conceſſions of the greateſt and moſt learned of the Deiſtical writers themſelves, (and this corrupt doctrine we are oppoſing, is much the ſame with their's) giving ſuch high incomiums to Chriſtia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, her conſtitution, rights, orders, ſacrament, laws, &amp;c. obliged thereto, by the light of truth, their own reaſon and conſcience, though enemies to divine re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation.

               </note> The moral philoſopher frequently expreſſes himſelf to the ſame purpoſe. And Mr. Chub acknowledges that Chriſtianity, if it could be ſeparated from every thing that is blended with it, yields a much clearer light, and is a more ſafe guide to mankind, than any other tradi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tionary religion, as being better adapted to improve and perfect human nature. Lord Bolingbroke, their champion, repreſent Chriſtianity as a moſt amiable and uſeful inſtitution, and that its natural tendency is to promote the peace and happineſs of mankind; that the ſyſtem of religion it teaches, is a complete ſyſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tem to all the purpoſes of religion, natural and reveal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed.
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:017829_0012_0FB81A99AEA6BBD8"/>
And in another place repreſents, that the ſyſtem of religion which Chriſt <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">

               </gap>, is a complete ſyſtem to all the purpoſes of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, natural and revealed. And again adds, that ſuppoſing Chriſtianity to have been an human inventi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, it had been the moſt amiable, and the moſt uſeful invention, that ever was impoſed on mankind for their good, and often to the ſame purpoſe elſewhere. Why then do they not adhere to this excellent divine conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution? Why the reaſons they give us, are thus truly confeſſed by themſelves, viz. becauſe they cannot bear the reſtraints that (that goſpel, or true religion) lays upon their corrupt luſts and paſſions. The real end they aim at, is expreſſed by one of themſelves, to ſave a ſoul from the diſmal apprehenſions of eternal damnation, to releaſe a perſon from labouring under that uneaſineſs of mind which often he is under, when pleaſure and Chriſtianity come in competition. And Lord Boling<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broke mentions it as an advantage of the way of think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, he recommends, that the burning lake will then diſappear. And one man ſaid that he found this goſpel preaching made a hell in a man's conſcience. In a word, 'tis eaſy to ſee whence the minds of determined ſinners come to be filled with ſuch unreaſonable preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dices againſt divine revelation.</p>
            <p n="5">V. WE add as a further argument; 'tis utterly im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible in the nature of the thing, that a man living
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:017829_0013_0FB81A9B4A8C64C8"/>
and dying in his ſins ſhould be happy, or enjoy heaven which he cannot be capable of; becauſe a ſinful na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and conſciouſneſs of guilt, will ever make a man miſerable in himſelf, be he where he will, in this world or the next: as it was with Adam and Eve in Paradiſe, on their fall; though they were created perfectly inno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent, holy and happy, yet immediately on their ſinning, they loſt all their peace and happineſs, and fell under amazing fear and terror, and vainly ſtrove to hide themſelves from God; as not able to bear the ſight of God their Maker. Sin and unpardoned guilt will ever produce the like effect: 'tis the gnawing worm in the breaſt that never dies; it makes ſinners tremble at the thoughts of appearing before God: hence the wicked man travels in pain all his days, is always ſubject to fear and inward uneaſineſs. In a word, he that is a ſlave to ſin can't but be a ſlave to fear; hence is like the troubled ſea that cannot reſt, conſequently can have no true peace in this world, or in the next. Job, xxxiv. 29. "When he giveth quietneſs, who then can give trouble? And when he hideth his face, who then can behold him?" Whether it be done againſt a nation, or againſt a man only.</p>
            <p n="6">VI. AS without holineſs, and the removal of guilt from the conſcience by pardon, the ſinner cannot ſee God, nor enjoy peace, or happineſs, were he in heaven; ſo no ſuch neceſſary ſanctifying change can be obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

on the other ſide death, or in the other world; and conſequently no ſuch ſinner dying in his ſins, can ever go to heaven to all eternity; for as the tree falls ſo it lies; as death leaves us, ſo judgment will find us, in the ſame ſtate of guilt and ſin, and paſs ſentence on us according<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly. For none of our actions, whether good or bad, will ever be imputed to us, but ſuch only as are done in the body, or while ſoul and body are united, making the ſame identical perſon: ſo the Apoſtle aſſures us. 2 Cor. v. 10. "That every one may receive the things done in the body, according to what he hath done, whether it be good or bad. But when death has diſſolved the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, laid the body in the grave, and the ſoul paſt into hades, or the receptacle of ſouls, be that where it may, all perſonal identity is then at an end; therefore inca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pable of receiving or doing any perſonal actions to be judged for,<note n="*" place="bottom">The ſoul indeed in this ſeparate ſtate, is doubtleſs much more knowing and ſuſceptible of pleaſure or pain<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> happineſs or miſery, than before in this life. &amp;c. but this belongs to the ſoul alone, the body having no ſenſe of or concern with the ſoul in this ſeparate ſtate; nor can any thing the ſoul does, enjoys or ſuffers, have any effect on the body which it once inhabited, ſo as either to make any ſatisfaction for, or increaſe the debt contracted whilſt in their union together here, on the final trial at the laſt day; nor yet can the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of the ſoul be complete while in this ſeparate ſtate, without the body, for the reſurrection of which, it waited with longing deſire. <hi>Rom<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> viii. 23.</hi> "Waiting for the adoption, viz, the redemption of the body."</note> and when at the great reſurrection day,

But how falſe and abſurd the notion, and what a miſerable foundation for comfort were it true.

And this is not only the voice of reaſon, but fully confirmed by God's ſacred oracles: alſo, Mat. v. 25, 26. Eccl. ix. 10 "For there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wiſdom, in the grave whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thou goeſt." Pſal. lxxxix. 10. "Wilt thou ſhew wonders to the dead?

            <p n="7">VII. MANKIND in this ſtate, are probationers and on trial for an endleſs eternity of happineſs, or miſery, and God has aſſured them that their wages ſhall be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to their works whether good, or evil.</p>
            <p>HE that ſows to the fleſh, ſhall of the fleſh reap cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruption; but he that ſows to the ſpirit, ſhall of the ſpirit reap life everlaſting, Gal. vi. 8. "He that ſows to the fleſh, viz. they that live corrupt carnal lives ſhall reap corruption, miſery and eternal death; but they that ſow to the ſpirit living holy, virtuous, ſpiritual lives, ſhall of the ſpirit reap life everlaſting." God hath plainly told us what the two different ſtates are, which men are on trial and labouring for in this life, and which all our actions here have reference to, and that our wages hereafter, ſhall be according to our works ſo in our text—and John iv, 36. "and he that reapeth receiveth wages, and gathereth fruit unto life eternal." Rom. vi. 22. "For the wages of ſin is death, but the gift of God is eternal life." And thus God treats mankind as reaſonable creatures, free, mortal agents, to chuſe for themſelves, whom they will ſerve, yet ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſing them to chuſe life, by chuicing the way that leads to it, ſ<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

light by his ſacred oracles, and promiſed him what his wages ſhall be according to the choice he makes of good or evil, &amp;c. Now, is not juſtice bound as much to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward eternal puniſhment to the finally unbelieving ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinate impenitent ſinner, as to reward the rightous be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieving penitent ſinner with life eternal, as God, would mentain a holy, righteous and juſt government? What reaſon then can the ſuffering ſinner have to complain, when he has but his own choice, for, in chuſeing the means and way, he choſe the end and receives but the juſt wages, he had been labouring for through his whole life of trial, according to that of the Apoſtle 2 Theſſa. i. 6, 7, 8, 9. "Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompence tribulation to them who trouble you; and to you who are troubled reſt with us, when the Lord Jeſus ſhall be revealed from heaven with his mighty angels, in flaming fire taking vengeance on them, who know not God and who obey not the goſpel of the Lord Jeſus Chriſt: Who ſhall be puniſhed with everlaſting deſtruction from the preſence of the Lord and from the glory of his Power, and may we not add Juſtice to?</p>
            <p n="8">VIII. Suffer me juſt to add, that the life eternal promiſed the righteous, may as well be affirmed to have an end, as the everlaſting puniſhment of the wicked; becauſe they are both delivered in the ſame expreſſions and commenſurate of the ſame meaſure of time. Nay

Which expreſſions of day and night are the ſame with thoſe which declare that of the happineſs of heaven, where they reſt not day and night, ſaying, holy, holy, holy, where they are before the throne of God and ſerve him day and night, in his temple.—To add only one argument more.</p>
            <p n="9">IX. We ſay our Saviour on a ſpecial occaſion has eſtabliſhed this doctrine beyond all reaſonable doubt, or diſpute, Matt. xii. 32. "Whoſoever ſhall ſpeak a word againſt the Son of Man, it ſhall be forgiven him; but whoever ſpeaketh againſt the Holy-Ghoſt, it ſhall not be forgiven him neither in this world, neither in the world to come"—How full and expreſs are theſe words, and preciſely agreeing with the original, word for word, aſſureing us that there are ſome ſinners who never ſhall, never will be pardoned, conſequently muſt ſuffer eternally for their ſins. Which ſurely is enough to overthrow that corrupt, wicked doctrine of univerſal ſalvation, of late taught among us; for if it be certain, that there be ſome that never ſhall be pardoned, why may not this be the caſe of all willful, incorrigible, im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitent ſinners dying in their ſins, how or where will you make the difference?

            <p>BUT our objector ſeems to entertain low and un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worthy thoughts of the immence being and infinite per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections of God, as tho' he were ſuch an one as him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, and could do nothing, that is equitable and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtant with juſtice, but what frail man can ſee through and determine the juſtice, and fitneſs of, which is in effect to arreign God at man's bar, and implicitly to deny him to be God, for how is he infinite in wiſdom

and incomprehenſible in all his perfections, if he can do nothing juſt and fit to be done, beyond what man is able to give a ſufficient reaſon for the equity and fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of. Pſal. lxxvii. 19. "Thy way is in the ſea and thy path in the great water, and thy footſteps are not known" But you inſiſt on it, that you cannot ſee, how a ſhort life of ſin in this world ſhould demerit end<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs puniſhment in the next, here therefore, conſider with ſeriouſneſs and candor the two following things, viz.</p>
            <p n="1">I. THAT the demerit of ſin conſiſts, not in the ſaddenneſs of the act or ſhortneſs of the life of ſin, but in the malignity of it, its exceeding ſinfullneſs in its nature, its incorrigible determined rebellion againſt God and his holy laws. The principle part of its malignity being an inſurrection againſt the majeſty and authority of the great Lord of the univerſe, to whom we owe all poſſible ſubjection and obedience, an oppoſing our wills, luſts and paſſions to the will, law and authority of the ſupreme God—How great muſt be the malignity of ſuch willful traiterous rebellion againſt a being of ſuch immenſe perfections and holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, how provoking the ingratitude, &amp;c. and how meritorous of the greateſt puniſhment, according to that well known maxim, that every rebellious, or abu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive act ariſes in its demerit in proportion to the digni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity of the perſon, againſt whom it is committed, ſure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:017829_0021_0FB9BFC714BEE1F0"/>
then no ſhort degree of puniſhment can be adequate here.</p>
            <p>SIN may appear ſmall in its firſt act and yet be very awful and malignant in its extenſive conſequences. The manner of Adams offence ſeemed ſmall, yet the diſobedience was emmenſely great; it being the tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion of that command which was given to be the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance and proof of man's ſubjection to God, in the breath of which command the majeſty and honour of the whole law were violated; and how great and awful the effects of this ſin to this day.— So murder is a ſhort, and ſudden act, but awful and laſting the guilt and effect of it, reaching down to the great judgement day, yea, to eternity unleſs repentance and pardon be ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained in this life.—Again, that moſt horrible murder and ſuicide, lately committed at Wetherfield, the moſt wicked father, ſlaying his four children, and their mother, his wife and then himſelf, all which was ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>denly perpetrated, likely in leſs then half an hour; but how great and laſting the guilt, and the effect reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing down not only to the great judgement day; but doubtleſs to eternity.</p>
            <p n="2">II. CONSIDER the Angels that ſinned, who vaſtly excelled us in nature, ſtrength and knowledge while holy: how did God deal with them, for one ſin, the firſt ſin though indeed vaſtly great and heinous, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidering
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:017829_0022_0FB9BFD2531EED90"/>
the perfect nature God had given them, the bleſſed ſtate they were in enjoying as much happineſs, as their nature was capable of, yet to rebel, to rebel in heaven, renounce their ſealty to God, diſpiſe his authority, contemn his goodneſs, &amp;c. How greatly muſt this encreaſe their guilt, and how juſtly did God, for this one ſin, this one ſo great act of rebellion, thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der them down out of heaven into hell, and ſhut them up under chains of darkneſs, to be reſerved, to the judgement of the great day, and then to be more cloſely ſhut up and confined in hell forever, having their eternal torments increaſed, by all the miſchief they are doing, and ſin they are tempting and leading man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind into, in this world which they now well know, and have trembling apprehenſions of now; yet, ſuch is their malice, that they cannot forbear going on in their wickedneſs tho' to the increaſe of their eternal torments, Jam. ii. 19. "Thou believeth there is one God, thou doeſt well, the devils alſo believe and trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble." And how much does incorrigible ſinners imitate them, in there perverſe ſinful practices, and why not therefore be partakers with them, in the ſame eternal puniſhment, to the manifeſtation of God's infinite hatred of ſin, the righteouſneſs and juſtice of his eternal government, that angels and men may forever fear and glorify God.</p>
            <p>Prop. XI.

               </gap> little more need be ſaid upon it, for its full proof; ſave only pointing out few texts for that end, as Dan xii. 3.

"And they ſhall be mine when I make up my jewels."—Luke xii. 32. "Fear not, little flock; for it is your father's good pleaſure to give you the kingdom." John xiv. 19.
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:017829_0023_0FB9BFD56FDA36B0"/>
"becauſe I live ye ſhall live alſo." i. e. as ſure as I live, as long as I live.—chap. x. 20, 27. "And I give unto them eternal life and they ſhall never periſh." How great, how precious are theſe promiſes made to all the goodly and more ſure in their fulfilment, than the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

"Every one that hath this hope in him, purifieth himſelf as he is pure."</p>
            <p>FINALLY to cloſe all with a word of emprovment, on what was offered and as we truſt proved under the firſt propoſition, ſhewing the fatal miſtake and danger thoſe are in, who deny the ſcripture doctrine of future rewards and puniſhments, or that wicked men an all the ungodly ſhall be eternaly puniſhed for their ſins in the other world. But why have men ſuch an averſion to goſpel reverlation, ſince it abridges us of no pleaſures within the bounds of purity and innocence: nor does it oblige us to extinguiſh our natural appetites and paſſions, but to govern and moderate them: it deprives us of nothing, but what, would be to our own hurt; as well as, hurt of ſociety, even in this ſtate and much more in the world to come. But what if it be found at laſt that ſuch unbelievers have rejected a true divine revelation, will it not involve them in the greateſt guilt and danger, when in that great day they ſhall be judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by this very goſpel Rom. ii. 16. But in a word is not the bear probability of the wrath to come ſo dread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful a thing, that a wiſe man would not run the hazard for a few tranſient, vicious gratifications. The princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pal man among the Deiſt, Lord Bolingbrook ſays (tho' perhaps ſneeringly) that which is a ſober and momen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous truth and what the reaſon of man cannot but ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove, that where there is a hell on the other ſide it is but natural prudence to take readily to the ſafeſt ſide.</p>
