            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>WHEN it pleaſed the eternal Son of GOD to tabernacle among us, and come preaching the glad Tidings of Salvation to a fallen World, different Opinions were entertained by differ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent Parties concerning him.—As to his Perſon, ſome ſaid he was <hi>Moſes;</hi> others that he was <hi>Elias, Jeremias,</hi> or one of the ancient Prophets; few acknowledged him to be what he really was, GOD bleſſed for ever<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>more.—And as to his Doctrine, tho' the common People, being free from Prejudice, were perſuaded of the heavenly Tendency of his going about to do Good, for the Generality heard him gladly, and ſaid he was a good Man; yet the envious, worldly-minded, ſelf-righteous Governors and Teachers of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> Church, being grieved at his Succeſs, on the one Hand, and unable (having never been taught of GOD) to underſtand the Purity of his Doctrine, on the other; notwithſtanding our LORD ſpake as ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver

Man ſpake, and did ſuch Miracles which no Man could poſſibly do, unleſs GOD was with him; yet they not only were ſo infatuated, as to ſay, that he deceived the People, but alſo were ſo blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous as to affirm, that he was in league with the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil himſelf, and caſt out Devils by Beelzebub the Prince of Devils.—Nay, our LORD's own Bre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thren and Kinſmen, according to the Fleſh, were ſo blinded by Prejudice and Unbelief, that on a certain Day, when he went out to teach the Multitudes in the Fields the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> ſent to take hold on him, urging this as a Reaſon for their Conduct, <abbr>viz,</abbr> 
               <hi>That he was beſides himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Thus was the King and Lord of Glory judged by Man's Judgment, when made manifeſt in the Fleſh: Far be it from any of his Miniſters to expect any better Treatment.—No, if we come in the Spirit and Power of our Maſter, in this, as in every other Part of his Sufferings, we muſt follow his Steps.—The like Reproaches which were caſt on him, will be thrown on us alſo.—Thoſe that received our Lord and his Doctrine, will receive and hear us for his Name-ſake.—The Poor, bleſſed be GOD, as our preſent Meeting abundantly teſtifies, receive the Goſpel, and the common People hear us gladly; whilſt thoſe that are ſitting in <hi>Moſes</hi> his Chair, and love to wear long Robes, being ignorant of the Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs which is of GOD by Faith in CHRIST JESUS, and having never felt the Power of GOD upon their Hearts, will be continually crying out againſt us, as Mad-men, Deceivers of the People, and as acting under the Influences of evil Spirits.</p>
            <p>But he is unworthy the Name of a Miniſter of the Goſpel of Peace, who is unwilling, not only to have his Name caſt out as evil, but alſo to die for the Truths of the Lord JESUS.—It is the Character
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:004861_0004_100E05FB9B06DE78"/>
of <hi>Hirelings</hi> and <hi>Falſe Prophets,</hi> who care not for the Sheep, to have all Men ſpeak well of them.—<hi>Bleſſed are you,</hi> ſays our LORD to his firſt Apoſtles, and in them to all ſucceeding Miniſters, <hi>when Men ſpeak all Manner of Evil againſt you falſely for my Name ſake.</hi>—And indeed it is impoſſible but ſuch Offences muſt come: For Men will always judge of others according to the Principles from which they act them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves.—And if they care not to yield Obedience to the Doctrines which we deliver, they muſt neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſarily, in Self-defence, ſpeak againſt the Preachers, leſt they ſhould be aſk'd that Queſtion, which the <hi>Phariſees</hi> of old feared to have retorted on them, if they confeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed that <hi>John</hi> was a Prophet, <abbr>viz.</abbr> 
               <hi>Why then did you not believe on him?</hi> In all ſuch Caſes, we have nothing to do but to ſearch our own Hearts, and if we can aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure our Conſciences, before GOD, that we act with a ſingle Eye to his Glory, we are chearfully to go on in our Work, and not in the leaſt to regard what Men or Devils can ſay againſt, or do unto us.</p>
            <p>But to return. You have heard what various Thoughts were handed about concerning JESUS CHRIST whilſt here on Earth: Nor is he other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe treated, even now he is exalted to ſit down at the Right Hand of his Father in Heaven.—A Stran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to Chriſtianity, was he to hear we all profeſs to hold one LORD, would naturally infer, that we all thought and ſpoke one and the ſame Thing about him. But alas! to our Shame be it mentioned, tho' CHRIST be not divided in himſelf, yet Profoſſors are ſadly divided in their Thoughts about him; and that not only as to the Circumſtances of his Religion, but alſo of thoſe eſſential Truths which muſt neceſſarily be believed and received by us, if ever we hope to be Heirs of eternal Salvation.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="8" facs="unknown:004861_0005_100E05FD212A8A20"/>
Some, and that I fear a Multitude which no Man can eaſily number, there are amongſt us, who call themſelves Chriſtians, and yet ſeldom or never ſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly think of JESUS CHRIST at all. They can think of their Shops, and their Farms, their Plays, their Balls, their Aſſemblies, and Horſe-races, Entertainments, which directly tend to exclude Religion out of the World (but as for CHRIST, the Author and Finiſher of Faith, the LORD who has bought poor Sinners with his precious Blood, and who is the only Thing worth their thinking of, alas! he is not in all, at moſt in very few, of their Thoughts. But believe me, O ye earthly, ſenſual, carnally minded Profeſſors, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever little you may think of CHRIST now, or how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever induſtriouſly you may ſtrive to keep him out of your Thoughts, by purſuing the Luſt of the Eye, the Luſt of the Fleſh, and the Pride of Life, yet there is a Time coming, when you will wiſh you had thought of CHRIST more, and of your Profits and Pleaſures leſs.—For the Gay, the Polite, the Rich alſo muſt die as well as others, and leave their Pomps, their Vanities, and all their Wealth behind them.—And oh! what Thoughts will you enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain concerning JESUS CHRIST, in that Hour.</p>
            <p>But I muſt not purſue theſe Reflections: They would carry me too far from the main Deſign of this Diſcourſe, which is to ſhew what thoſe that are truly deſirous to know how to worſhip GOD in Spirit and in Truth, ought to think concerning JESUS CHRIST, whom GOD hath ſent to be the End of the Law for Righteouſneſs to all them that ſhall believe.</p>
            <p>I truſt, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> you are more noble than to think me too ſtrict or ſcrupulous, in thus attempting to regulate even your Tho'ts about JESUS CHRIST: For by our Thoughts as well as our Words and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, are we to be judged at the Great Day. And
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004861_0006_100E05FF51A00620"/>
in vain do we hope to believe in, or worſhip CHRIST aright, unleſs our Principles on which our Faith and Practice is founded, are agreeable to the Form of ſound Words deliver'd to us in the Scriptures of Truth.</p>
            <p>Beſides, many Deceivers are gone abroad into the World. Mere <hi>Heathen Morality,</hi> and not JESUS CHRIST, is preached in moſt of our Churches. And how ſhould People think rightly of CHRIST, of whom they have ſcarcely heard? Do bear with me a little then, whilſt, to inform your Conſciences, I aſk you a few Queſtions concerning JESUS CHRIST: For there is no other Name given under Heaven, whereby we can be ſaved, but his.</p>
            <p>And <hi>Firſt, What think you <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">
                     <desc>〈…〉</desc>
                  </gap> the Perſon of</hi> CHRIST? <hi>Whoſe Son is he?</hi> This is the Queſtion our LORD put to the <hi>Phariſees</hi> in the Words fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing the Text; and never was it more neceſſary to repeat this Queſtion than in theſe laſt Days. For Numbers that are called after the Name of CHRIST, and I fear, many that pretend to preach him, are ſo far advanced in the blaſphemous Chair, as openly to deny his being really, truly and properly GOD. But no one that ever was Partaker of his Spirit, will ſpeak thus lightly of him. No; if they are aſked, as <hi>Peter</hi> and his Brethren were, <hi>but whom ſay ye that I am?</hi> they will reply without Heſitation, <hi>Thou art</hi> CHRIST <hi>the Son of the everliving GOD.</hi> For the Confeſſion of our Lord's Divinity, is the Rock upon which be builds his Church. Was it poſſible to take this away, the Gates of Hell would quickly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail againſt it.—<hi>My Brethren,</hi> if JESUS CHRIST be not very GOD of very GOD, I would never preach the Goſpel again. For it would not be Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel; it would be only a Syſtem of moral Ethicks: <hi>Seneca, Cicero,</hi> or any of the Gentile Philoſophers would be as good a Saviour as JESUS of <hi>Nazareth.</hi>
               <pb n="10" facs="unknown:004861_0007_100E06017B488B50"/>
It is the Divinity of our LORD that gives a Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on on to his Death, and makes him ſuch a High-Prieſt as became us, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> One who by the infinite Merits of his Suffering could make a full, perfect, ſufficient Sacrifice, Satisfaction and Oblation to an infinitely offended Juſtice. And whatever Miniſter of the <hi>Church of England,</hi> makes uſe of her Forms, and eats of her Bread, and yet holds not this Doctrine (as I fear too many ſuch are crept in amongſt us) ſuch a one belongs only to the <hi>Synagogue of Satan.</hi>—He is not a Child or Miniſter of GOD: No; he is a Wolf in Sheep's Cloathing, he is a Child and Miniſter of that Wicked One the Devil.</p>
            <p>Many will think theſe hard Sayings: But I think it no Breach of Charity to affirm, that an <hi>Arian</hi> or <hi>Socinian</hi> cannot be a Chriſtian.—The one would make us believe JESUS CHRIST <hi>is only a Created God,</hi> which is a Self-Contradiction. And the other would have us look on him only as <hi>a Good Man,</hi> and inſtead of owning his Death to be an Atonement for the Sins of the World, would perſuade us, <hi>that</hi> CHRIST <hi>died only to ſeal the Truth of his Doctrine with his Blood.</hi> But if JESUS CHRIST be no more than a mere Man, if he be not truly GOD, he was the vileſt Sinner that ever appeared in the World.—For he accepted of Divine Adoration from the Man who had been born blind, as we read <hi>John</hi> ix. 38. <hi>And he ſaid, LORD I believe, and worſhipped him.</hi> Beſides, if CHRIST be not properly GOD, our Faith is vain, we are yet in our Sins:—For no created Being, tho' of the higheſt Order, could poſſibly merit any thing at GOD's Hands: No, it was our LORD's Divinity, that alone qualified him to take away the Sins of the World; and therefore we hear St. <hi>John</hi> pronouncing ſo poſitively, that <hi>the Word,</hi> i. e. JESUS CHRIST, <hi>was not only with GOD; but was GOD.</hi>—
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004861_0008_100E0603DF0ECE40"/>
For the like Reaſon, St. <hi>Paul</hi> ſays, that <hi>he was in the Form of GOD.</hi>—<hi>That in him dwelt all the Fulneſs of the Godhead bodily.</hi>—Nay, JESUS CHRIST himſelf aſſumes the Title which GOD gave to himſelf, when he ſent <hi>Moſes</hi> to deliver his People <hi>Iſrael. Before Abraham, was,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I am.</hi>—And again, <hi>I and my Father are one.</hi> Which laſt Words, tho' our modern Infidels would evade and wreſt, as they do the other Scriptures, to their own Damnation; yet it is evident, that the <hi>Jews</hi> underſtood our LORD, when he ſpake thus, as tho' he made himſelf equal with GOD; otherwiſe why did they ſtone him as a Blaſphemer?—And now, why ſhould it be thought a Breach of Charity, to affirm, that th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">
                  <desc>•••</desc>
               </gap> that deny the Divinity of JESUS CHRIST, in the ſtricteſt Senſe of the Word, cannot be Chriſtians? For they are greater Infidels than the Devils themſelves.—They confeſſed that they knew who he was, <hi>even the holy One of GOD.</hi>—They not only believe, but which is more than the Unbelievers of this Generation do, they tremble.—And was it poſſible for <hi>Arius</hi> or <hi>Soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nus,</hi> thoſe Arch-Hereticks, to be releaſed from their Chains of Darkneſs, under which (unleſs they altered their Principles before they died) they are now reſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved to the Judgment of the great Day, I am perſuaded they would inform us, how Hell had convinced them of the Divinity of JESUS CHRIST, and that they would adviſe their Followers to abhor their Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples, leſt they ſhould come into the ſame Place, and thereby increaſe each others Torments.</p>
            <p>But, <hi>Secondly, What think you of the Manhood or Incarnation of</hi> JESUS CHRIST? For CHRIST was not only GOD, but he was GOD and Man in one Perſon. ....Thus runs the Text and Context. ....<hi>When the</hi> Phariſees <hi>were gathered together,</hi> JESUS <hi>aſked them, ſaying, What think ye of</hi> CHRIST? <hi>Whoſe

Son is he?</hi> They ſay unto him, <hi>the Son of</hi> David.—<hi>How then,</hi> ſays our Divine Maſter, <hi>does David in Spirit call him LORD?</hi> From which Paſſage it is evident, that we do not think rightly of the Perſon of JESUS CHRIST, unleſs we believe him to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect GOD and perfect Man, of a reaſonable Soul and human Fleſh ſubſiſting.</p>
            <p>For it is on this Account that he is called CHRIST, or the <hi>anointed, i. e.</hi> one who through his own vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luntary Offer was ſet apart by the Father, &amp; ſtrength<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ened and qualified by the Anointing or Communica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Holy Ghoſt, to be a Mediator between him and offending Man.</p>
            <p>The Reaſon or firſt Cauſe why the Son of GOD took upon him our Nature, was, the Fall of our firſt Parents.—I hope there is no one preſent ſo athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſtical, as to think that Man made himſelf: No, it was GOD that made us, and not we ourſelves.—And I would willingly think, that no one would be ſo blaſphemous as to ſuppoſe, that if GOD did make us, he made us ſuch Creatures as we now find our<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves to be. For this would be giving GOD's Word the lie, which tells us, that <hi>in the Image of GOD,</hi> not in the Image which we now bear on our Souls, <hi>made he Man.</hi> For as GOD made Man, ſo GOD made him perfect. He placed him in the Garden of <hi>Eden,</hi> and condeſcended to enter into a Covenant with him, promiſing him eternal Life, upon Condition of an unſinning Obedience; and threatning eternal Death, if he broke his Law, and eat the forbidden Fruit.</p>
            <p>Man did eat; and herein acting as our Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative, thereby involved both himſelf and us in that Curſe, which GOD, the righteous Judge, had ſaid ſhould be the Conſequence of his Diſobedience.—But here begins that Myſtery of Godlineſs, GOD manifeſted in the Fleſh. For (ſing, O Heavens, and
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004861_0010_100E0607C355A728"/>
rejoice, O Earth!) the eternal Father, foreſeeing how <hi>Satan</hi> would bruiſe the Heel of Man, had in his eternal Counſel, provided a Means whereby he might bruiſe that accurſed Serpent's Head. Man is permitted to fall, and become ſubject to Death; but JESUS the only begotten Son of GOD, begotten of the Father before all Worlds, God of God, Light of Light, very God of very God, offers to die to make an Attonement for his Tranſgreſſion, and to fulfil all Righteouſneſs in his ſtead. And becauſe it was im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible for him to do this as he was GOD, and yet ſince Man had offended, it was neceſſary it ſhould be done in the Perſon of Man, rather than we ſhould periſh; this <hi>Everlaſting GOD,</hi> this <hi>Prince of Peace,</hi> this <hi>Antient of Days,</hi> in the Fulneſs of Time, had a Body prepared for him by the Holy Ghoſt, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came an Infant of a Span long.—In this Body he performed a compleat Obedience to the Law of GOD, whereby he, in our ſtead, fulfilled the Cove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant of Works, and at laſt became ſubject to Death, even the Death upon the Croſs; that as GOD he might ſatisfy, as Man he might obey and ſuffer; and being GOD and Man in one Perſon, might once more procure a Union between GOD and our Souls.</p>
            <p>And now, What think you of this Love of CHRIST? Do not you think it was wondrous great? Eſpecially when you conſider that we were CHRIST's bitter Enemies, and that he would have been infinitely happy in himſelf, notwithſtanding we had periſhed for ever.—Whatever you may think of it, I know the bleſſed Angels, who are not ſo much concerned in this Myſtery of Godlineſs as we, think moſt highly of it.—They do, they will deſire to look into and admire it, thro' all Eternity.—Why, Oh why, ye Sinners, will you not think of this Love of CHRIST?—Surely it muſt melt down the moſt harden'd

Heart.—Whilſt I am ſpeaking, the Thoughts of this infinite and condeſcending Love, fires and warms my Soul.—I could dwell on it forever.—But it is expedient for you, that I ſhould aſk you another Queſtion concerning JESUS CHRIST.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Thirdly, What think you about being juſtified by</hi> CHRIST?—I believe I can anſwer for ſome of you.—For many, I fear, think to be juſtified or looked upon as righteous in GOD's Sight, without JESUS CHRIST.—But ſuch will find themſelves dreadfully miſtaken: For <hi>out of</hi> CHRIST <hi>GOD is a conſuming Fire.</hi>—Others ſatisfy themſelves with believing that CHRIST was GOD and Man, and that he came into the World to ſave Sinners in general. Whereas their chief Thoughts ought to be, how they may be aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red that JESUS CHRIST came into the World to ſave them in particular.—<hi>The Life that I now live in the Fleſh,</hi> ſays the Apoſtle, <hi>is by Faith of the Son of GOD, who loved me and gave himſelf for me.</hi>—Obſerve, <hi>for me.</hi> For it is this immediate Application of JESUS CHRIST to our own Hearts, that renders his Merits effectual to our eternal Salvation. An unapplied CHRIST will do us no Service at all.—Others there are that go ſtill further: For they think that JESUS CHRIST is GOD-MAN, that he is to be applied to their Hearts, and that they can be juſtified in GOD's Sight only in or thro' him; but then they make him only in Part a Saviour.—They are for doing what they can themſelves, and then JESUS CHRIST is to make up the Deficiencies of their Righteouſneſs. This is the Sum and Subſtance of of our modern Divinity: And was it poſſible for me to know the Thoughts of moſt that hear me this Day, I believe they would tell me, this was the Scheme they had laid, &amp; perhaps depended on for ſome Years, for their eternal Salvation.

               <hi>my Brethren,</hi> for you to entertain quite different Tho'ts concerning Juſtification by JESUS CHRIST? For if you think thus, you are in the Caſe of thoſe unhappy <hi>Jews,</hi> who went about eſtabliſhing their own Righteouſneſs, and would not ſubmit to, and conſequently miſſed of that Righteouſneſs which is of GOD by Faith in CHRIST JESUS our LORD. What think you then, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> if I tell you, that you are to be juſtified freely thro' Faith in JESUS CHRIST, without any Regard to any Work, or Fitneſs, foreſeen in us, at all? For Salvation is the free Gift of GOD. I know no Fitneſs in Man, but a Fitneſs to be caſt into the Lake of Fire and Brimſtone forever. Our Righteouſneſſes in GOD's Sight are but as filthy Rags. He cannot away with them. Our Holineſs, if we have any, is not the Cauſe, but the Effect of our Juſtification in GOD's Sight.—We love GOD, becauſe he firſt loved us. We muſt not come to GOD as the proud <hi>Phariſee</hi> did, bringing in as it were a Reckoning of our Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices. We muſt come in the Temper and Language of the poor <hi>Publican,</hi> ſmiting upon our Breaſts and ſaying, <hi>GOD be merciful to me a Sinner.</hi> For JESUS CHRIST juſtifies us whilſt we are ungodly.—He came not to call the Righteous, but Sinners to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. The poor in Spirit, they who are willing to go out of themſelves, and rely wholly on the Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of another, are only ſo bleſſed as to be Members of his Kingdom. The Righteouſneſs, the whole Righteouſneſs of JESUS CHRIST, is to be imputed to us, inſtead of our own. For we are not under the Law, but under Grace: And as many as walk after this Rule, Peace be on them; for they, and they only are the true <hi>Iſrael</hi> of GOD. In the great Work of Man's Redemption, Boaſting is intirely excluded; which could not be if only one of our

Works was to be joined with the Merits of CHRIST. Our Salvation is all of GOD from the Beginning to the End. <hi>It is not of Works, leſt any Man ſhould boaſt.</hi> Man has no hand in it: It is CHRIST who is to be made to us of GOD the Father, Wiſdom, Righteouſneſs, Sanctification and eternal Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.—His active as well as his paſſive Obedience, is to be applied to poor Sinners. He has fulfilled all Righteouſneſs in our ſtead, that we might become the Righteouſneſs of GOD in him.—All we have to do, is to lay hold on this Righteouſneſs by Faith: And that very Moment we do apprehend it by a lively Faith, that very Moment we may be aſſured that the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt has cleanſed us from all Sin.—For the Promiſe is to us and to our Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren, and to as many as the LORD our GOD ſhall call. If we and our whole Houſes believe, we ſhall be ſaved as well as the Jaylor and his Houſe: For the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt is an everlaſting as well as a perfect Righteouſneſs.—It is as effectual to all them that believe in him now, as formerly; and ſo it will be, till Time ſhall be no more. Search the Scriptures as the <hi>Bereans</hi> did, and ſee whether theſe Things are not ſo. Search St <hi>Paul'</hi>s Epiſtles to the <hi>Romans</hi> and <hi>Galatians,</hi> and there you will find this Doctrine ſo plainly taught you, that unleſs you have Eyes and ſee not, he that runs may read.

            <p>This Doctrine of our free Juſtification by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, however cenſured and evil ſpoken of by our preſent Maſters of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> was highly eſteemed by our wiſe Fore-Fathers: For in the ſubſequent Words of the fore mentioned Article, it is called <hi>a
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:004861_0014_100E0610ED8E9130"/>
moſt wholeſome Doctrine, and very full of Comfort;</hi> and ſo it is to all that are weary and heavy laden, and are truly willing to find Reſt in Jeſus Chriſt.</p>
            <p>This is Goſpel, this is glad Tidings of great Joy to all that feel themſelves poor, loſt and undone damned Sinners. <hi>Ho every one that thirſteth, come unto the Waters of Life and drink freely; come and buy without Money and without Price.</hi>—Behold a Fountain opened in your Saviour's Side, for Sin and for all Uncleanneſs. Look unto him whom you have pierced. Look unto him by Faith, and verily you ſhall be ſaved, tho' you came here only to ridicule and blaſpheme, and never thought of GOD or of Chriſt before.</p>
            <p>Not that you muſt think GOD will ſave you be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe, or on Account of your Faith: For Faith is a Work, and then you would be juſtified for your Works. But when I tell you, we are to be juſtified by Faith, I mean that Faith is the Inſtrument where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Sinner applies or brings home the Redemp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of Jeſus Chriſt to his Heart. And to whom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoever GOD gives ſuch a Faith (for it is the free Gift of GOD) he may lift up his Head with Bold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, he need not fear, he is a ſpiritual Son of our ſpiritual <hi>David,</hi> he has paſſed from Death to Life, he ſhall never come into Condemnation.—This is the Goſpel which we preach. If any Man or Angel preach any other Goſpel, than this of our being free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly juſtified thro' Faith in Chriſt Jeſus, we have the Authority of the greateſt Apoſtle to pronounce him accurſed.</p>
            <p>And now, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> What think you of this Fooliſhneſs of Preaching? To you that have taſted the good Word of Life, and been enlightned to ſee the Riches of GOD's free Grace in Chriſt Jeſus, I am perſuaded it is precious, and has diſtilled
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:004861_0015_100E061273BBCE10"/>
like the Dew into your Souls.—And Oh! that all were like minded!—But I am afraid Numbers are ready to go away contradicting and blaſpheming. Tell me, are there not many of you ſaying within your<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, <q>This is a licentious Doctrine; this Preacher is opening a Door for Encouragement in Sin.</q> But this does not ſurprize me at all; it is a ſtale antiquated Objection, as old as the Doctrine of Juſtification it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf; and (which by the Way is not much to the Credit of thoſe who urge it now) it was made by an Infidel. St. <hi>Paul</hi> in his Epiſtle to the <hi>Romans,</hi> after he had in the firſt five Chapters demonſtrably proved the Doctrine of Juſtification by Faith alone; in the ſixth, brings in an Unbeliever ſaying, <hi>ſhall we conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue in Sin then that Grace may abound?</hi> But as he rejected ſuch an Inference with a <hi>God forbid,</hi> ſo do I: For the Faith which we preach is not a dead ſpeculative Faith, <hi>an aſſenting to Things credible as credible,</hi> as it is commonly defined. It is not a Faith of the Head only: but a Faith of the Heart. It is a living Principle wrought in the Soul, by the Spirit of the Ever-living GOD, whereby the Sinner being convinced of his loſt and undone Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition by Nature, is enabled to apply or lay hold on the perfect Righteouſneſs of JESUS CHRIST freely offered in the Goſpel, and whereby out of a Principle of Love and Gratitude, he is afterwards continually excited to abound in every good Word and Work. This is the Sum and Subſtance of the Doctrine that has been delivered.—And if this be a licentious Doctrine judge ye.—No, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> this is not deſtroying, but teaching you how to do good Works, from a proper Principle.—For to uſe the Words of our Church in another of her Articles, <q>Works done before the Grace of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and the Inſpiration of the Spirit, are not pleaſant to God, foraſmuch as they
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:004861_0016_100E0613FB6EF358"/>
ſpring not of Faith in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi>—rather for that they are not done as God has willed and command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed them to be done, we doubt not but they have the Nature of Sin.</q> So that they who bid you do, and then live, are juſt as wiſe as thoſe who would per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuade you to build a beautiful magnificent Houſe, without laying a Foundation.</p>
            <p>It's true, the Doctrine of our free Juſtification by Faith in CHRIST JESUS, like other Goſpel Truths, may and will be abuſed by Men of corrupt Minds, Reprobates concerning the Faith: But <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="3 letters">

               </gap>y who receive the Truth of GOD in the Love of it, will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways be ſhewing their Faith by their Works. For this Reaſon, St. <hi>Paul</hi> after he had been telling the <hi>Ephe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſians, That by Grace they were ſaved thro' Faith, not of Works, leſt any Man ſhould boaſt,</hi> immediately adds, <hi>For we are his Workmanſhip, created in Chriſt Jeſus nnto good Works.</hi> And in his Epiſtle to <hi>Titus,</hi> having given him Directions, <hi>Chap.</hi> 3. <hi>Ver.</hi> 7. to tell Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple they were juſtified by Grace, directly ſubjoins, <hi>Ver.</hi> 8. <hi>I will that you affirm conſtanly, that they which have believed in God might be careful to maintain good Works.</hi> Agreeable to this we are told in our 12th Article, <q>That albeit good Works, which are the Fruits of Faith, and follow after Juſtification, can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not put away our Sins, and endure the Severity of God's Judgment; yet are they pleaſing and accep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table to God in Chriſt; and do ſpring neceſſarily out of a true and lively Faith, inſomuch that a lively Faith may be as evidently known by them as a Tree diſcerned by the Fruit.</q>

            <p>Oh what would I give, that this Article was duly underſtood and preached by all that have ſubſcribed to it! The Ark of the Lord would not then be driven into the Wilderneſs, nor ſo many diſſent from the <hi>Church of England.</hi>—For I am fully perſuaded, that

it's not ſo much on account of Rites and Ceremonies, as our not Preaching the Truth as it is in JESUS, that ſo many have been obliged to go and ſeek for Food elſewhere. Did not we fall from our eſtabliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Doctrines, few, comparatively ſpeaking, would fall from the eſtabliſh'd Church. Where <hi>Chriſt</hi> is preached, tho' it be in a Church or Common, Diſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of all Denominations have and do moſt freely come. But if our Clergy will preach only the Law, and not ſhew the Way of Salvation by Faith in <hi>Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> the Charge of Schiſm at the Day of Judgment, I fear, will chiefly lie at their Door. The true Sheep of <hi>Chriſt</hi> know the Voice of <hi>Chriſt'</hi>s true Shepherds, <hi>Strangers they will not hear.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Obſerve, <hi>my dear Brethren,</hi> the Words of the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticle, <hi>good Works are the Fruits of Faith, and follow after Juſtification.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How then can they precede or be any ways the Cauſe of it? No; our Perſons muſt be juſtified be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore our Performances can be accepted. God had reſpect to <hi>Abel</hi> before he had reſpect to his Offering: And therefore the Righteouſneſs of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> muſt be freely imputed to, and apprehended by us thro' Faith, before we can offer an acceptable Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to God: For out of <hi>Chriſt,</hi> as I hinted before, God is a conſuming Fire; and whatſoever is not of Faith in Chriſt, is Sin.</p>
            <p>People's miſtaking the Doctrine of free Juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, I believe, is partly owing to their not rightly conſidering the different Perſons St. <hi>Paul</hi> and St. <hi>James</hi> wrote to in their Epiſtles, as alſo the different Kind of Juſtification each of them writes about: The former aſſerts in Line upon Line, Argument upon Argument, <hi>that we are juſtified by Faith alone.</hi>—The latter puts this Queſtion, <hi>Was not</hi> Abraham <hi>juſtified by Works?</hi> From whence many, not conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dering
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:004861_0018_100E061895193EC0"/>
the different Views of theſe Holy Men, and the different Perſons they wrote to, have blended and joined Faith and Works in order to juſtifie us in the Sight of God. But this is a Miſtake all over: For St. <hi>Paul</hi> was writing to the Jewiſh Proſelites, who ſought Righteouſneſs by the Works, not of the Ceremonial only, but of the Moral Law.—In Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradiſtinction to that, he tells them they were to look for Juſtification in God's Sight, only by the perfect Righteouſneſs of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> apprehended by Faith.—St. <hi>James</hi> had a different Set of People to deal with, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> ſuch who abuſed the Doctrines of free Juſtification, and thought they ſhould be ſaved (as Numbers among us do now) upon their barely pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſing to believe on <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>—Theſe the holy Apoſtle endeavours wiſely to convince, that ſuch a Faith was only a dead and falſe Faith, and therefore it behoved all who would be bleſſed with faithful <hi>Abraham,</hi> to ſhew forth their Faith by their Works as he did:—<hi>For was not</hi> Abraham <hi>juſtified by Works,</hi> ſays he? <hi>i. e.</hi> Did he not prove that his Faith was a true juſtifying Faith by its being productive of good Works? From whence it is plain that St. <hi>James</hi> is talking of a declarative Juſtification before Men: <hi>Shew me,</hi> demonſtrate, evidence to me, that thou haſt a true Faith, by thy Works. Whereas St. <hi>Paul</hi> is talking only of our being juſtified in the Sight of God; and thus he proves that <hi>Abraham,</hi> as we alſo are to be, was juſtified before ever the Moral or Ceremonial Law was given to the Jews: For it is written, <hi>Abraham believed in the Lord, and it was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted to him for Righteouſneſs.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Take the Subſtance of what has been ſaid on this Head, in the few following Words.—Every Man that is ſaved, is juſtified three Ways. <hi>Firſt,</hi> meri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly, <hi>i. e.</hi> by the Death of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> It is
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:004861_0019_100E061AC1B9D560"/>
the Blood of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt alone that cleanſes us from all Sin. Secondly,</hi> inſtrumentally, <abbr>
                  <hi>viz.</hi>
               </abbr> By Faith; Faith is the Means or Inſtrument whereby the Merits of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> are applied to the Sinner's Heart: <hi>Ye are all the Children of God by Faith in</hi> Chriſt Jeſus. <hi>Thirdly,</hi> we are juſtified declaratively; namely, by good Works, <hi>i. e.</hi> good Works declare and prove to the World, that our Faith is a true ſaving Faith.—<hi>Was not</hi> Abraham <hi>juſtified by Works?</hi> and Again, <hi>Shew me thy Faith by thy Works?</hi>—</p>
            <p>It may not be improper to illuſtrate this Doctrine by an Example or two. I ſuppoſe no one will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend to ſay, that there was any Fitneſs for Salvation in <hi>Zacheus</hi> the Publican, when he came to ſee <hi>Jeſus</hi> out of no better Principle, than that whereby perhaps Thouſands are led to hear me preach, I mean Curi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oſity; but <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> prevented and called him by his free Grace, and ſweetly, but irreſiſtibly inclined him to obey that Call, as I pray God he may influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence all you that come only to ſee who the Preacher is. <hi>Zacheus</hi> received our Lord joyfully into his Houſe, and at the ſame Time by Faith receiv'd him into his Heart. <hi>Zacheus</hi> was then freely juſtified in the Sight of God.—But behold the immediate Fruits of that Juſtification! He ſtands forth in the Midſt, and as before he had believed in his Heart, he now makes Confeſſion with his Mouth to Salvation.—<hi>Behold, Lord, the Half of my Goods I give unto the Poor, and if I have taken any Thing from any Man by falſe Accuſation, I reſtore him Four-fold.</hi>—And thus it will be with thee, O Believer, as ſoon as ever God's dear Son is revealed in thee by a living Faith, thou wilt have no Reſt in thy Spirit, till out of Love and Gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude for what God has done for thy Soul, thou ſhe weſt forth thy Faith by thy Works.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="23" facs="unknown:004861_0020_100E061C4AB09280"/>
Again, I ſuppoſe every Body will grant there was no Fitneſs for Salvation in the Perſecutor <hi>Saul,</hi> no more than there is in thoſe perſecuting Zealots of theſe laſt Days, who are already breathing out Threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nings, and, if in their Power, would breath out Slaugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter alſo, againſt the Diſciples of the LORD.</p>
            <p>Now our Lord, we know, freely prevented him by his Grace (and, O that he would thus effectually call the Perſecutors of this Generation) and by a Light from Heaven ſtruck him to the Ground.—At the ſame Time, by his Spirit, he pricked him to the Heart, convinced him of Sin, and cauſed him to cry out, <hi>Who art thou, Lord?</hi> Chriſt replies, <hi>I am</hi> JESUS <hi>whom thou perſecute<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="2 letters">

               </hi> Faith then was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantaneouſly given him, and behold, immediately <hi>Saul</hi> cries out, <hi>Lord what wouldſt thou have me to do?</hi> And ſo will every poor Soul that believes on the Lord <hi>Jeſus</hi> with his whole Heart. He will be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways aſking, <hi>Lord what ſhall I do for thee? Lord what wouldſt thou have me to do?</hi> Not to juſtify him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but only to evidence the Sincerity of his Love and Thankfulneſs to his all-merciful High-Prieſt, for plucking him as a Firebrand out of the Fire.</p>
            <p>Perhaps, many Self-righteous Perſons amongſt you, may flatter yourſelves, that you are not ſo wicked as either <hi>Zacheus</hi> or <hi>Saul</hi> was, and conſequently there is a greater Fitneſs for Salvation in you than in them. But if you think thus, indeed you think more highly of yourſelves than you ought to think: For by Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture we are all alike, all equally fallen ſhort of the Glory of God, all equally dead in Treſpaſſes and Sins, and there needs the ſame Almighty Power to be exerted in converting any one of the moſt ſober, good natured Moral Perſons here preſent, as there was in converting the Publican <hi>Zacheus,</hi> or that no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torious Perſecutor <hi>Saul.</hi>—And was it poſſible for you
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:004861_0021_100E061EC6F714C0"/>
to aſcend into the higheſt Heavens, and to enquire of the Spirits of juſt Men made perfect, I am perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed they would tell you this Doctrine is from God. But we have a more ſure Word of Prophecy, to which we would do well to give heed, as unto a Light ſhining in a dark Place. <hi>My Brethren,</hi> the Word is n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

            <p>
               <hi>Fourthly</hi> and laſtly, <hi>What think you of</hi> JESUS CHRIST <hi>being formed within you?</hi> For whom <hi>Chriſt</hi> juſtifies, them he alſo ſanctifies. Altho' he finds, yet he does not leave us unholy.—A true Chriſtian may not ſo properly be ſaid to live, as JESUS CHRIST to live in him. For they only that are led by the Spirit of CHRIST, who is GOD, are the true Sons of GOD.</p>
            <p>As I obſerved before, ſo I tell you again, the Faith which we preach is not a dead, but a lively active Faith wrought in the Soul and working a thorough Change, by the Power of the Holy Ghoſt, in the whole Man—And unleſs CHRIST be thus in you, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding you may be orthodox as to the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Principles, notwithſtanding you may have good Deſires, and attend conſtantly on the Means of Grace; yet, in St. <hi>Paul'</hi>s Opinion, you are out of a State of Salvation. <hi>Know you not,</hi> ſays that Apoſtle to the <hi>Corinthians,</hi> a Church famous for its Gifts above any Church under Heaven, <hi>that</hi> CHRIST <hi>is in you,</hi> 
               <abbr>viz.</abbr> by his Spirit, <hi>unleſs you are Reprobates?</hi>
            </p>
            <p>For <hi>Chriſt</hi> came not only to ſave us from the Guilt, but the Power of our Sins: Till he has done this, however he may be a Saviour to others, we can have no Aſſurance, or well-grounded Hope, that he has ſaved us: For it is by receiving his bleſſed Spirit into our Hearts, and feeling him witneſſing with
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:004861_0022_100E06219D5844A0"/>
our Spirits, that we are the Sons of God, that we can be certified of our being ſealed to the Day of Redemption.</p>
            <p>This is a great Myſtery, but I ſpeak of <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>New Birth.</hi>—Marvel not at my aſking you, what you think about <hi>Chriſt</hi> being formed within you? For either GOD muſt change his Nature, or we ours. For as in <hi>Adam</hi> we all have ſpiritually died, ſo all that are effectually ſaved by <hi>Chriſt,</hi> muſt in <hi>Chriſt</hi> be ſpiritually made alive. His only End in dying and riſing again, and interceding for us now in Heaven, is to redeem us from the Miſery of our fal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>len Nature, and, by the Operation of his bleſſed Spirit, to make us meet to be Partakers of the Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Inheritance with the Saints in Light. None but thoſe that thus are changed by his Grace here, ſhall appear with him in Glory hereafter.</p>
            <p>Examine yourſelves therefore, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther you are in the Faith; prove yourſelves; &amp; think it not ſufficient to ſay in your Creed, <hi>I believe in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt:</hi> For you do not believe, you are Liars, you are Reprobates, you are yet in a State of Death. You take God's Name in vain when you call him Father. Your Prayers are turned into Sin, unleſs you believe into <hi>Chriſt,</hi> ſo as to have your Life hid with him in God, and to receive Life and Nouriſhment from Him, as the Branches do from the Vine.</p>
            <p>I know, indeed, the Men of this Generation deny there is any ſuch Thing as Feeling CHRIST within them; but alas! to what a dreadful Condition would ſuch reduce us, even to the State of the abandoned Heathens, who St. <hi>Paul</hi> tells us were <hi>paſt Feeling.</hi>—The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> prays that the <hi>Epheſians</hi> may abound in all Knowledge &amp; <hi>Spiritual Underſtanding,</hi> or as it might be rendered, <hi>Spiritual Senſation.</hi>—And in the Office for the Viſitation of the Sick, the Miniſter prays, that
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:004861_0023_100E062322EDD560"/>
the Lord may make the ſick Perſon know and <hi>feel,</hi> that there is no other <hi>Name</hi> under Heaven given unto Men, in whom and thro' whom they may receive Health and Salvation, but only the Name of our Lord JESUS.—For there is a ſpiritual, as well as a corporeal Feeling, and tho' this is not communicated to us in a ſenſible Manner, as outward Objects affect our out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward Senſes, yet it is as real, as any ſenſible or viſible Senſation, and may be as truly felt and diſcerned by the Soul, as any Impreſſion from without can be felt by the Body.—All that are born again of God, know that I lie not.</p>
            <p>What think you, Sirs, did <hi>Naaman</hi> feel when he was cured of his Leproſy? Did the Woman feel Virtue coming out of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> when ſhe touch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Hem of his Garment, and was cured of her bloody Iſſue? So ſurely mayeſt thou feel, O Believer, when <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> dwelleth in thy Heart. I pray God make you all know and feel this, e'er you de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>part hence.</p>
            <p>Oh, <hi>my Brethren,</hi> my Heart is enlarged towards you. I truſt I feel ſomething of that hidden, but powerful Preſence of CHRIST, whilſt I am preaching to you. Indeed it is ſweet, indeed it is exceeding comfortable. All the Harm I wiſh you, that with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Cauſe are my Enemies, is, that you felt the like. Believe me, tho' it would be Hell to my Soul, to return to a natural State again, yet I would wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lingly change States with you for a little while, that you might know what it is to have <hi>Chriſt</hi> dwelling in your Hearts by Faith. Oh! Do not turn your Backs. Do not let the Devil hurry you away. Be not afraid of Convictions. Do not think worſe of the Doctrine, becauſe preached without the Church Walls.—Our Lord in the Days of his Fleſh, preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on a Mount, a Ship, a Field; and I am perſuad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:004861_0024_100E0624A873ED30"/>
many have felt his gracious Preſence here.—In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed we ſpeak what we know.—Oh do not reject the Kingdom of God againſt yourſelves. Be ſo wiſe as to receive our Witneſs.—I cannot, I will not let you go. Stay a little, let us reaſon together.—However lightly you may eſteem your Souls, I know our Lord has ſet an unſpeakable Value on them. He thought them worthy of his moſt precious Blood.—I beſeech you therefore, O Sinners, be ye reconciled to God. I hope you do not fear being accepted in the Beloved.—Behold he calleth you. Behold he pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vents and follows you with his Mercy, and hath ſent forth his Servants into the High-ways and Hed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, to compel you to come in. Remember then, that at ſuch an Hour, of ſuch a Day, in ſuch a Year, in this Place, you were all told what you ought to think concerning <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi>—If you now periſh, it will not be for lack of Knowledge.—I am free from the Blood of you all.—You cannot ſay I have been preaching Damnation to you.—You can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſay I have, like legal Preachers, been requiring you to make Brick without Straw. I have not bid you make yourſelves Saints, and then come to God.—But I have offer'd you Salvation on as cheap Terms as you can deſire.—I have offered you <hi>Chriſt'</hi>s whole Wiſdom, <hi>Chriſt'</hi>s whole Righteouſneſs, <hi>Chriſt'</hi>s whole Sanctification and Eternal Redemption, if you will but believe on him.—If you ſay you cannot believe, you ſay right; for Faith as well as every other Bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing is the Gift of God: But then wait upon God and who knows but he may have Mercy on thee. Why do we not entertain more loving Thoughts of CHRIST? Or do you think he will have Mercy on o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, and not on you? But are you not Sinners? And did not JESUS CHRIST come into the World to ſave Sinners?—If you ſay you are the chief of Sinners; I

anſwer, that will be no Hindrance to your Salvation, indeed it will not, if you lay hold on him by Faith. Read the Evangeliſts, and ſee how kindly he behaved to his Diſciples who fled from and denied him. <hi>Go tell my Brethren,</hi> ſays he.—He does not ſay, Go tell thoſe Traitors; but, Go tell my <hi>Brethren; And Peter;</hi> as tho' he had ſaid, <q>go tell my Brethren in general, and poor <hi>Peter</hi> in particular, <hi>that I am riſen.</hi> Oh, comfort his poor drooping Heart, tell him I am reconciled to him. Bid him weep no more ſo bitterly. For though with Oaths and Curſes he has thrice deny'd me, yet I have died for his Sins, I am riſen again for his Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, I freely forgive him all.</q>—Thus ſlow to Anger, and of great Kindneſs, was our all-merciful High-Prieſt. And do you think he has changed his Nature, and forgets poor Sinners now he is exalted to the Right-Hand of God? No, he is the ſame Ye<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterday, to Day and forever, and ſitteth there only to make Interceſſion for us. ..... Come then, ye Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lots, come ye Publicans, come ye moſt abandoned Sinners, come and believe on <hi>Jeſus Chriſt.</hi> Tho' the whole World deſpiſe you and caſt you out, yet he will not diſdain to take you up. Oh! amazing, Oh! infinitely condeſcending Love, even you he will not be aſhamed to call his Brethren. And Oh! how will you eſcape if you neglect ſuch a glorious Offer of Salvation? What would the damned Spirits now in the Priſon of Hell give, if <hi>Chriſt</hi> was ſo freely offered to their Souls? And why are not we lifting up our Eyes in Torment? Does any one out this great Multitude dare ſay, he does not deſerve Damnation? If not, why are we left and others taken away by Death? What is this but an Inſtance of God's free Grace, and a Sign of his good Will towards us? Oh then, let God's Goodneſs lead us to Repentance!
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004861_0026_100E06290C8F4560"/>
Oh let there be Joy in Heaven over ſome of you repenting! Tho' we are in a Field, I am perſuaded the bleſſed Angels are hovering now around us, and long, <hi>as the Hart panteth after the Water Brooks,</hi> to ſing an Anthem at your Converſion. Bleſſed be God I hope their Joy will be fulfilled. An awful Silence appears amongſt us. I have good Hope that the Words that the Lord has enabled me to ſpeak in your Ears this Day, have not altogether fallen to the Ground. Your Tears and deep Attention are an Evidence, that the Lord God is amongſt us of a Truth. Come ye <hi>Phariſees,</hi> come and ſee, in ſpight of your Satanical Rage and Fury, the Lord JESUS is getting himſelf the Victory. And Brethren, I ſpeak the Truth in CHRIST, I lie not, if one Soul of you, by the Bleſſing of God, be brought to think ſavingly of <hi>Jeſus Chriſt</hi> this Day, I care not if my Enemies were permitted to carry me to Priſon and put my Feet faſt in the Stocks, as ſoon as I have deliver'd this Sermon. Brethren, my Heart's Deſire and Prayer to God is, that you may be ſaved. For this Cauſe I follow my Maſter without the Camp. I care not how much of his ſacred Reproach I bear, ſo that ſome of you be converted from the Error of your Ways. I rejoice, yea and I will rejoice. Ye Men, ye Devils do your worſt. The LORD who ſent will ſupport me. And when CHRIST, who is our Life, and whom I have now been preaching, ſhall appear, I alſo, together with his deſpiſed little Ones, ſhall appear with him in Glory.—And then, what will you think of CHRIST?—I know what you will think of him. You will then think him to be <hi>the Faireſt among ten Thouſand.</hi> You will then think and <hi>feel</hi> him to be a juſt and Sin-avenging Judge. Oh then be ye perſuaded to kiſs him leſt he be angry, and ſo you be baniſhed forever from the Preſence of the Lord. Behold I

come to you, as the Angel did to <hi>Lot.</hi> My dear <hi>Brethren,</hi> flee, flee for your Lives, haſte, linger no longer in your ſpiritual <hi>Sodom;</hi> for otherwiſe you will be eternally deſtroyed. Numbers, no Doubt, there are amongſt you, that may regard me no more than <hi>Lot'</hi>s Sons-in-law regarded him. I am perſuaded I ſeem to ſome of you as one that mocks.—But I ſpeak the Truth in CHRIST, I lie not, as ſure as Fire and Brimſtone rained from the Lord out of Heaven, to deſtroy <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah,</hi> ſo ſurely at the great Day ſhall the Vials of God's Wrath be pour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on you, if you do not think ſeriouſly of and act a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the Goſpel of the Lord's CHRIST. Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold I have told you before,—I pray GOD, all you that forget him may ſeriouſly think of what has been ſaid, before he pluck you away and there be none to deliver you.</p>
