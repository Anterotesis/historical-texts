            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>I<hi>T pleased the Lord in his holy Wisdom to afflict me with a Fever in the moneths of</hi> July <hi>and</hi> August, 1684. <hi>and in his own due time to command its departure. As an offer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of praise and thankfulness to the Majesty and Mercy of God. I thought of composing this Tract, though under the remaining weakness derived from an autumnal distemper: yet thereby I humbly hope some benefit may arrive to broken and tempted Spirits. For though my mouth be shut and silent as to Publick Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, yet I should greatly rejoice, if my heart could be opened in Print, to help any towards heaven. The Dedication is proper to your
<pb facs="unknown:000429_0003_0FA5B08B1E8B59E8"/>
most noble person, if you please to accept, what would be an infringement of duty not to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sent to you who have so often refreshed me and mine in my privacies and retirements, kindnesses not to be buried in the grave of in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gratitude: but to be acknowledged before the Sun. Your Library was also most kindly open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to my use: wherein stands many an ancient Author, calling aloud for converse, and reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out his auxiliary hand, and pointing at the state of Christianity in former and purer ages. There did I first consider of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signation of the Canon of Scripture which is toucht upon in these Papers, but might be much more amplified and adorned: had I more con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stancy of abode and supplies of the yet re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maining Records of the first five hundred years that have happily survived the flaming fury and rage of the barbarous Goths and Van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals and other wasters of both the East and Western Empire, which might have conduced to the compleating of such a work. But we must wait the times of Divine Wisdom in appointment of any such happy seasons to view those desirable monuments.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But why print? and why on such a subject?
<pb facs="unknown:000429_0004_0FA5B08CE398DE88"/>
and why now? I answer to the first and third because being interrupted in my greatest work, I would gladly be some way useful in my generation: It may be, some that mourn in secret, and others that are as yet not called, but under the Election of Grace may attend and meditate on these things. Tho Preaching or Printing prevail but little with this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generate age,</hi> (Jer. 6.29.) <hi>though the Bellowes be burnt in the fire, and the lead consumed which was appointed to purify the drossy Oare: yet with</hi> Jeremy <hi>and</hi> Esay, <hi>and</hi> Paul <hi>we must in our several ages keep on where God opens the door of opportunity for us, tho</hi> Israel <hi>be not ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered, let the Labour of faithful Workmen wait for its reward from the Lord of the Har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vest. Tho we for our Labour of love be ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>counted as the shavings and off-scourings of all things to this day: tis but for this life:</hi> (1 Cor 4. 13.) <hi>tho all the filth and garbage of the tongues in the streets of</hi> Ashdod <hi>be flung into our Carts, we must carry away the burden patiently, and meekly wipe off the soile from our names and faces. Tho our presence be a burden to many houses, and our testimony less minded than the piping of Children in a Market place,</hi> (Luk. 7. 32.) <hi>yet our Lord commands us to
<pb facs="unknown:000429_0005_0FA5B08D0C1E4F68"/>
persist, till he relieves us. But that which I must every where own,</hi> Worthy <hi>Sir, give me the favour I pray, and leave to testifie: that your reverence in hearing and accepting of their messages, as of the Lord's</hi> Embassadors <hi>hath been alwayes very exemplary, and I hope will return into your bosom with a Prophets re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward who have been an</hi> Obadiah <hi>to them in the time of spiritual Famine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>But</hi> Secondly, <hi>Why on such a subject?</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Answer,</hi> Tho many have written, yet tis inexhaustible: besides methods may vary, and variety breeds delight, if joyn'd with brevity. <hi>If I have laid the foundation of such a Discourse in the beginning a little deeper than usual upon the Divinity of Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture, and the Deity of our blessed Lord: I hope and beg that the Learned, Wise and Pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous would not count that or any part, a di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gression too improper: heartily wishing, it may succeed,</hi>

            <head>The Preface.</head>
            <p>HAving Observed, that many Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stians spend their Dayes in the Valley of Sorrow, and walking up and down very pensive, being full of Fears and Doubts about their eternal Estate, can perform no chearful Service to God, bring little honour to their Profession, or comfort to their Relations, or any sweet quiet to their own spirits: I often pondered what should be the bitter root of all this Wormwood and Gall, and being very de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sirous to deal in compassion, as having been under some tentations, I spake with several, and found upon conference these following to be the principal causes of this Bondage of Spirit.</p>
            <p>The I. Was great ignorance of the true nature of Faith, and of the main funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental Truths of the Gospel, which did a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze me to find upon search in so many glittering, talking, but indeed shallow Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fessors.</p>
            <p n="2">
               <pb facs="unknown:000429_0009_0FA5B0900FC61218"/>
2. Another wa<hi>s</hi> the great Levity, Van<hi>i</hi>
               <g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and Laxness of their lives, trifling out their precious time in fidling querks, tales and jests, to please some whose Trenchers they hang upon like the Parasites in <hi>Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phrastus,</hi> not lihe the blessed People of the former age, who far outshined us in the pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity of Conversation, and therefore in the brightness of their assurance.</p>
            <p n="3">3. Others I observed to be of a froward, perverse, ill-natur'd, ill-conditioned, sower humor, full of prate and unprofitable mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiplicity of words, censures, backbitings, hollowness of true friendship: often mur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>muring at God, and quarrelling with their Superiors.</p>
            <p n="4">4. Others I perceived to be naturally of a fearful, timorous, wavering, inconstant, suspitious spirit, ever learning, and never coming to the knowledg of the Truth.</p>
            <p n="5">5. And to end, most people extream worldly, couvetous, full of fordid, over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reaching tricks and cunning cheats in dea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling, and unless for a show, basely backward to any excellent works of charity, and strict in examining the poor, to find an evasion which <hi>Jerom</hi> so complains of in some of his
<pb facs="unknown:000429_0010_0FA5B090DA9A4D80"/>
age. Such as these eat out the very po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer of godliness, and rob themselves of the season of meditation, <hi>Periclitatur religio in negotiis</hi> Piety is lost in a crowd of worldly bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siness with these and the rest I must declare that the holy Spirit of God delights not to hold communion, as being fiery or miry Spirits.</p>
            <p>Hereupon in my retirements (I hope by the Grace of God) I pitcht my thoughts (when I could not be so publickly useful as formerly) upon the composing a small Treatise of the genuine nature of Faith, and in a peculiar Chapter to shew the indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual connexion of Sanctification of heart and life in every gracious Believer.</p>
            <p>In the management whereof, I thought it might not be inexpedient to lay its foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation upon the Doctrine of the verity of the Scriptures in one Chapter, and of the Deity of our blessed Lord in a second af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter the Preface; the former being the Doctri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal object of Faith, &amp; the latter the personal.</p>
            <p>Now forasmuch that in all Sciences there be certain Principles, on which their Theoremes and Maximes are built: we may consider of the like in Divinity, that
<pb facs="unknown:000429_0011_0FA5B0919192F278"/>
the Holy Scriptures, (2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3.15.16.) (be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing able to make us wise to Salvation) are the only true Basis and Foundation, on which all the great Doctrines of Holiness and Happiness do most firmly insist. In particular that great point of Faith, which bears it self on the new Covenant of Grace, revealed in those sacred Pages. I thought meet therefore briefly to endeavour the proof of this high point, that the Scriptures of the Old and New Testament are the undoubted Word of the living God; and thereby to be received with all veneration imaginable as the solid fundamental of true Christianity, &amp; in special of the weighty Doctrine of Faith: And this I have the more willingly performed at the entrance of this Tract, that good Christians may not (I hope) need to go other where to draw: But have sufficient to settle their Faith on this Foundation, tho it be more amply en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larged upon abroad.</p>
            <p>Now whereas it may be said that Princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples are indemonstrable, as in <hi>Mathematicks</hi> and other Sciences, <note place="margin">
                  <hi>Suarez. 5to. Met<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taph.</hi> L. C.</note> we must understand that Maxim of the Principles of Essence
<pb facs="unknown:000429_0012_0FA5B09566BFD878"/>
and not of cognition or knowledg. It is so, as to the verity of Holy Scriptures, we cannot demonstrate them any further (and tis enough) than that they are founded on the glorious Authority of the infinitely wise, true, and most holy God, as consenta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious to the verity and excellency of his na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and published by his injunction, as the rule of life and means of communion with himself in eternal happinesss. The Lord hath spoken, and who shall not tremble? (<hi>Amos</hi> 3.8.) Oh that Majestick stile, (<hi>Ezek</hi> 14.4. <hi>&amp;c</hi>) [<hi>Thus faith the LORD</hi>] makes Men and Devils to quake, and rottenness to enter into their Spirits, when God sets it home upon their consciences.</p>
            <p>My Design then is to shew, that at the Revelation and Exhibition of the holy vo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lumes, that I may both satisfie and confirm weak Believers, and convince (if possible) scoffing Atheists, that there were such migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Testimonies of their divine, original at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending the dispensing of them to the Church and the World that may convince all of their Heavenly Off-spring! If persons but not on the veil of wilful ignorance, (2 <hi>cor.</hi> 3. 15.) detaining the truth in un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteousness.
<pb facs="unknown:000429_0013_0FA5B0980C355DC0"/>
And in the close it will ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear that Hystorical Faith well grounded is useful to true and saving Faith.</p>
            <p>There are then two principal points which did await their sliding down from Heaven into the hearts of the illuminated Pen-men inspired by the Holy Ghost, and the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of them to the People in their distinct Ages, which may be comprehended in the first Chapter.</p>
            <p n="1">1. The wonderful Oracles and Prophe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies mentioned in those sacred leaves, which have been punctually fulfilled in the seve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Generations of the Church.</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Divine Miracles above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond the power of nature; exhibited at those two great junctures, the delivery of the Law by <hi>Moses,</hi> and the promulgation of the Gospel at Mount Zion. In the conclu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion of this first Chapter, I intend (God willing) to treat somewhat of the consig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Canon of Holy Scripture, a Point much desired by some, and may be of use to others.</p>
            <p>In the second Chapter, let us speak to the Deity of our blessed Lord: which in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed is the grand point of Christian Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion
<pb facs="unknown:000429_0014_0FA5B09A2F1EE1A8"/>
&amp; the very Foundation of the Church of God, as <hi>Nicephorus Callis<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>us</hi> reports a Story of a deep Cave discovered at <hi>Jerusa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lem</hi> under the ruines of the old Temple (when the <hi>Jews</hi> by the permission and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stigation of <hi>Julian</hi> to contradict the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy of our Lord, would needs attempt to build it again, but were beaten off by Thunder and Lightning) where they found within it upon a Stone Pillar the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>spel of the Apostle <hi>John,</hi> fairly laid and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served. Let the Patriarch protect the truth of the story: I mention it allusively to this great Truth that lies at the Foundation of the true Church, that the Deity of Christ the principal design of <hi>John's</hi> Gospel, is the only Rock laid by the Father in Zion, (<hi>Isai.</hi> 28.16.) without which our Faith sinks, and all our hopes vanish. If that be a nullity, all is gone, Christianity is a vain Profession and our Bibles as to Christ and the new Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant of Grace of no value.</p>
            <p>Wherefore O <hi>Professors</hi> of this true Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion hold these two points inviolable as your lives [<hi>Tho verity of the Scriptures, and the Deity of Christ</hi>] Then may we safely and comfortably proceed to the main
<pb facs="unknown:000429_0015_0FA5B09A691D92E0"/>
subject of this Discourse, the nature of true saving Faith: which I have divided into ten Chapters, but shall inlarge principally on three or four, being the drift and scope of my writing to help the Joy of FAITH in those poor hearts; who tho truly gracious, yet like young <hi>Samuel,</hi> cannot well discern the voice and presence of Christ. And this my undertaking I beg the divine help and Grace to assist and prosper, extending my time and health after my late sickness, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to his blessed will, affording the fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vourable influence of his loving counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance.</p>
            <p>This Tract divides into two parts. The first containing the Foundation; the second the more visible superstructure about the nature of faith. The first concluding with two Chapters, and the second with ten.</p>
            <p>But whereas some may question, what need any further on this Subject, wherein several <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 word">

               </gap> already travelled. I may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyne that Holy <hi>Luke</hi> thought meet (in his pure Greek) as to his handling that heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Subject of our Lords Life, (<hi>Luk.</hi> 1. 1.) that though many had taken it in hand be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, yet he would set forth some things not
<pb facs="unknown:000429_0016_0FA5B09A9F0A59A0"/>
mentioned by other Evangelists. Yea, how many in almost all ages have prosecuted the same points in Divinity with benefit and use to the Church, both in Commentaries and Controversies? This consideration incouraged these Lines to appear: having observed some further need of these Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, on which I mainly insist, and were the great motive of my writing, and are but little toucht heretofore, and yet are very useful to chosen Vessels; Yet, the far great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er number of the truly gracious Servants of God. To whom it you draw near, and can have the happiness to come with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in them for their good (for they are shy &amp; aware of every approach) you may find their lives to hang in an anxious suspence between fear and hope, and feed only upon some few gracious glimpses, like the Beams from between <hi>April</hi> Clouds let down out of Heaven into their hearts to sustain their Spirits from sinking, and to preserve from dying under grievous Fits of the palpitation of their hearts.</p>
            <p>To these I chiefly bend my Souls desire
<pb facs="unknown:000429_0017_0FA5B09B6BE97098"/>
and humbly beg the dewes of <hi>Zion</hi> upon these Meditations and Labours, that nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther they nor I may faint under lost ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pectations of Mercy.</p>
            <p>And so I finish the Preface, and come to the Treatise it self.</p>

                  <p>But I shall not dwell upon the several Heads to clear this truth, so often insisted upon by the Pious and Learned, in their Systems and Bodies of Divinity, but I shall only touch some of them, and inlarge upon one or two, which are the chief design of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. One Argument that some mention is their venerable Antiquity, which though it be no cogent proof, vet allowing that of an ancient, (<hi>quo quid antiquius, co verius</hi>) that Truth is elder than Error, I would not lay aside the pains of <hi>Clemens Alexandrinus</hi> and others, who prove that the writings of <hi>Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses</hi> are ancienter than any the Heathen world can pretend to. To which I would annex their stupendious preservation through the fury of all ages, especially the raging flames of <hi>Antiochus</hi> and <hi>Dioclesian,</hi> those cruel Persecutors of the Church of God; neither would I be silent as to the invincible pains, <note place="margin">

                     </note> and toile which the <hi>Jew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ish</hi> Masorites underwent to preserve the <hi>Hebrew</hi> Original. With such exactness did they manage that Affair, that they had <hi>in numerato,</hi> punctually set down every word and every letter in the whole Bible,
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:000429_0020_0FA5B09D9A545B40"/>
and did also set down which was the middle word and middle letter of the whole, and I think of every individual Book: which was indeed a high providence of God towards the conservation of those happy leaves; and I could heartily wish the New Testa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment had been so guarded by industrious and holy persons in the primitive times. Nay it were well, if yet at this day some pious Rectors of <hi>Universities</hi> and <hi>Schools of Learn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> would take up the ancientest and purest Copies, and perform it at this time. The Masorites did the work long after the first penning of them on purpose to preserve it in their dispersions.</p>
                  <p>But I proceed to other Arguments, As</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Majesty of their Stile, that might justly make the <hi>Universe</hi> tremble, and all the powers of darkness to hide their heads in the dark Chaos of confusion.</p>

The self-denial of the Pen-men, dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>covering their own sins and heart corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions with the follies and weakness of their nearest and dearest relations, which is not done by other Writers, as <hi>Thucydides, Xe. nophon,</hi> or <hi>Plutarch,</hi> or <hi>Livy,</hi> but especially by Law-givers, which might disparage their Government; as the compilers of the twelve Tables, or <hi>Theodosius</hi> in his Codex, or <hi>Justinian</hi> in his Pandects, or other his Sanctions of the Civil Law.</p>

                  <p n="6">6. In the sixth place, a principal argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may be deduced from the Imperial Power and Efficacy on the Souls and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences of men; both as to conviction of sin, sustentation of wounded Spirits, and their consolation under the darkest clouds and deepest confusions, while we are in this valley of Dragons, which is the reason why truly gracious persons wade and dive through Sicknesses, Troubles and strong anxieties; when wicked and ungodly men languish and perish a thousand times over and over, because the former enjoy the sweet influences of the Spirit of God in the promises of the Gospel, to cool their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sciences and calm their spirits into a hal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cyon serenity, and sometimes tread upon the Asp and Dragon without any fear.

                     <p>But yet that I may set before all a method to convince every candid person of the truth of Scripture upon this score, and hence their divine original; I would de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sire them to do but two things:</p>

the fulfilling at this present day.</p>
                     <p n="2">2.

                     <head>The Miracles in Scripture.</head>
                     <p>HAving Treated some what of the infal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lible Prophecies, I shall now by the Grace of God rehearse some of the notable Miracles mentioned in Holy Scripture. For as much as they are works above the power of nature, therefore all Nations stand ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zing at such mighty exhibitions of Gods Majesty; such as curing blind-born Persons, the restoring the dumb and lame, who were so afflicted from the Mothers Womb, yea, reviving of many from death to life: are they not undeniable Testimonies, that such a one that performs these, is a God, or transacted by the immediate assistance and presence of God? whence we may very well infer, that what such a one speaks is to be embraced as by divine Authority. For that glorious Person, that manifests in his works such heavenly and coelestial power, must be believed to be God, and a God of supream Truth and highest verity, as well as of surpassing power. For infinite power and truth are and can be centerd no where but in a God.</p>
                     <p>

Let us then recite some of the noble works of God mentioned in the divine Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges; that shewed themselves both before, and attended the promulgation of the Law and Gospel, which transcended all the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wers of nature and of Angelical Spirits to produce: altho evil Spirits have ever la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>boured to imitate God, and set up a chappel of Miracles to oppose the glory of his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty, and of the holy Prophets, and of the Son of God.</p>
                     <p n="1">1. The first that offers, is the destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of <hi>Sodom</hi> by fire from Heaven, menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned by <hi>Strabo, Pliny, Solinu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">

But if we can clear that the Gospel of <hi>John</hi> was the last book of holy Scripture, that ever was written by the appointment of God, it were to pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pose indeed, that the Canon were sealed up by it.

                  <p>To Prove the Doctrines of <hi>C</hi>hrist to be true and perfect, we must de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monstrate his person to be infallible, and to prove his sufferings to be satisfactory to Divine Justice, there must be an infinite value in that glorious person, who was graciously pleased to suffer for the sins of the Elect. If this be clear, then Faith builds upon a Foundation as firm as the Being, Fidelity and <hi>C</hi>onstancy, of a holy and gracious God: This can't be better fixed, but by manifesting the Deity of <hi>C</hi>hrist in the glorious Messiah, who appeared upon Earth in the daye<hi>s</hi> of <hi>Augustus Caesar.</hi> Now if <hi>C</hi>hrist be God, even the natural <hi>S</hi>on of God, then the most precious Blood of his sufferings by communication of idioms or
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:000429_0060_0FA5B0D2D6389940"/>

                  <p>For the Proof of the Deity of <hi>C</hi>hrist, I intend no great Enlargement, but refer to those who write directly against the <hi>Socini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>an Heresie:</hi> it concerns us only to argue a little upon this point, and deduce some intermixed consequencies.</p>
                  <p>As to this great <hi>S</hi>ubject, having already accounted for the Divinity of the <hi>S</hi>criptures we may now take leave to use them as Te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stimonies sent from heaven, and left upon Record in the <hi>C</hi>hurch to prove this Truth. On which very score, its commonly recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved from the Antients, that the Apostle <hi>John</hi> wrote his Gospel against <hi>Cerinthus,</hi> and other primitive Hereticks, by the insti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of the <hi>Asian C</hi>hurches. But most certainly by the inspiration of the spirit of God. After him <hi>Athanasius</hi> of <hi>Egypt, Hillary</hi> of <hi>France</hi> and <hi>Fulgentius</hi> of <hi>Africa,</hi> and several others have largly and nervous<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly handled the sword of the spirit against the <hi>Arians.</hi> Let us however touch a few arguments in the case.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The first argument may be taken from the Eternity of Christ, no <hi>B</hi>eing can be eternal, but must be God. Our Lord was in <hi>B</hi>eing from all Eternity, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore must needs be God: <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Joh:</hi> 17. 5.</note> he had a glory with the Father before the world was, but let us joyn it with eternal sonship, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, that if he were the eternal son of God
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:000429_0061_0FA5B0D3A04C7E60"/>
then he must be true <hi>G</hi>od in Essence, for he must be every way the character of his Hypostasis, or as we translate it, the express image of his Person. This Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Christs being God, because he was the eternal son of God. The <hi>Jews</hi> very well understood its force, and therefore presently argued against him of Blasphemy in assuming the honour of being God. For to be the eternal Son of God, <note place="margin">
                        <hi>John</hi> 5. 18.</note> he must be coessential with God: which confession that Christ was the <hi>S</hi>on of God; he required of all his Disciples, and it must be understood of his eternal Being, and not as <hi>Adam</hi> is called a <hi>S</hi>on of God: be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause he urges the <hi>Jews</hi> with his works, and such as none can produce but a God, such as the Father performed; <note place="margin">

But were this Law of God made the Law of <hi>N</hi>ations, his blessing would follow it with more peace and tranquility, then yet the world hath seen.</p>
                  <p>Well then, as Truth is a most radiant at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tribute of God, and dwells in his nature, as he is <hi>Ens primum &amp; simplicefrmum,</hi> the eternal and uncompounded Being: And if Angels,<note place="margin">

Hence it is that in whatever he speaks from his most holy mouth by Oracles or Prophets ratified in their authority from him, must be judged a great presumption and impiety to call for a reason of any of his words or actions by bold and daring, and impudent creatures. For from the raies of truth streaming from the immense and soul-dazling sun of his verity flows all the certainty and stabiliment in the spirits of angels or men, to fix and settle us in our belief and obedience.</p>
                  <p>Whoever then does believe, sets his seal to the Word that God is true; and he that

                        <hi>John</hi> 3. 33.</note> as far as in him lies, would seem to induce, that the holy and true God, should be a lyar and deceiver, and not to be trusted. Such is the most horrible conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent of unbelief. Though I am well sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfied, that there are some trembling souls, <note place="margin">

As I knew not long since a gracious Person, when discoursing of the work of God upon her heart, <note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 5. 10. <hi>&amp;</hi> 6. 29.</note> said that she trembled at that Scripture in <hi>John,</hi> of making God a lyar, and that the deep pondring upon it, was the beginning of her conversion One is apt to think, it were a very easy thing to believe the holy God upon his Word: <note place="margin">

It's true, that the doctrine of the Gospel is a most faithful say<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that is, a most certain and undoubted assertion full of grace and truth, and wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of all acceptation or embracing (<hi>u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trique ulnis &amp; in utraque cordis camera</hi>) in our most intimate bosomes: that Christ came into the world to save sinners: But it requires almighty power of the spirit of Christ to bring us to the obedience of faith,
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:000429_0080_0FA5B0EC84B39918"/>
But of this more (God granting) in the sequel. Now I'le proceed about some things in the nature of Faith, to which end I may recount that good old saying of <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stin</hi> cited by some <hi>Accipe &amp; signas</hi>) re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive it, that is, believe it, and thou feal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est to the truth of God. Thus <hi>Sarah</hi> act<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing by Faith, judged him faithful who had promised, and attained the end of her par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular trust in the case whereunto God had spoken.</p>
                  <p>But not to dilate in generals, I might proceed to the hononymy of the term, and the various Synonymous expressions of it found in Scripture. I might from fathers and schoolmen, from confessions of the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed Churches, and their commentaries, common places and Systemes from contro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>versial writings between us and the <hi>Roma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nists,</hi> and from the many holy practical writers of our own on this very subject, raise a great pile or mass of discourse, and therein but <hi>actum agere,</hi> over and over with the same in some little varieties. But I forbear, since my chief end and scope is principally to erect and comfort broken, languishing spirits, that hang in suspence as it were between the hopes of heaven, and the fears of hell: I would gladly put a Scripture staff (even one of the slaves of the Ark within the Sanctuary) into the hands of every weary and heavy laden soul.</p>
                  <p>I shall not then be nice or over-curious in handling this point under the distinct heads of definition or description, or in di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinguishing it into several sorts, and so

proceed to examine all the causes, effects properties, adjuncts, contraries, and the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral corollaries deducible from all: or the cases of conscience, doubts and objections afflicting troubled spirits; for they are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable: but only treat upon some par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticulars most practical and useful, either past by, or but lightly touched by others.

Though I am sensible of my own deficiency, and intreat a candid Reader to pardon what is here done out of a great thirst and desire to cast in some mites for initiated believers, as may help I hope, and add to their faith, or the joy of faith, and supply something of what is yet lacking in the faith of some weaker christians, with whom we converse in Ordinances.

the soul being changed, is now by its own spontaneous freedom carried with a spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual naturality to that which is coadequate to its essence, and hath received from God a blessed recovery to an enjoyment of, and a complacency in this supreame and everlasting good.

For the whole soul, whole heart, whole will, so far as renewed, is carried out with all the Sails of its desires, and satiated with the sense and comfort of this most happy change, and when come to heaven will be fully concentred in those enjoyments, and bathed in that Ocean of bliss, no otherwise in their (though mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nute) proportion, than God himself, the humane nature of our Lord, then holy Angels, and the Saints in glory.</p>

The holy new convert is greatly sensible of its proud flesh, and that heavy lump that hangs like a talent of lead at the feet: and the worlds bird-lime that sticks to the wings of the soul, when it would mount up to heaven in holy duties.

Again, This troubled soul flies far from the land of excuses, hates palliations, and self-conceited applauses, and layes all the fault upon it self: heaps accusations, and layes snares and tentations for its own feet: and so great, that the holyest minister, and one skilful in cases of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science, can hardly sometimes answer and resolve.

But our gracious young convert is as sensible of the least sin, as the tender<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>est hand hath a quick and immediate sense of the fitting of a flye, or the gentle brea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things of a Western Air. It laments over In-dwelling sin, bewails its residence, and sounds continual alarums against it. For it cannot bear the domination of that proud Vice-roy of Satan, to fullfil it in any lusts thereof. If it prevail though but a little, the soul triumphs as if its conquering flag were entring the gates of heaven. For although its motions and impulses against unholiness be yet but weak, tender and low; yet are they the fruits of integrity, and grow forward in <hi>S</hi>trength. This i<hi>s</hi> a true sign of grace, and that the new life is in good earnest begun in that heart; for is finds repentance towards <hi>G</hi>od, and true sorrow for sin, conjoyned with real incli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nations, resolutions and workings in its gradual turning from it, and an holy ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of all thoughts of reversion to it.</p>
                  <p n="7">7. The soul feels within it self an ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly inclination to sincerity, in all its actions; which like a fragrant perfume in every chamber of all its powers and faculties, gives a grateful scent in every duty: <note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p>As to Argumentation:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. <hi>First,</hi> By Arguments drawn from our having and acting of Faith and the effects of it, we may obtain some measure of this blessed priviledg. Thus [Whosoever be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieves in Christ, such a persons sins are par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doned, and therefore shall be saved. But <hi>I</hi> believe, and therefore <hi>I</hi> shall be saved. The major Proposition is expresly the Word of God, and built upon the rock of eternity. The minor, which is [That <hi>I</hi> believe] must be wrought out and proved by the first Chapter of this Treatise, or any other holy Directions; and then upon examina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is to be found in the sense and experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of thine own soul: and thence the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion will irrefragably and undeniably follow with unspeakable comfort and full of glory. Now here a <hi>C</hi>hristian may see, how necessary it is to ponder diligently upon the true nature of Faith, and to understand its inward essence and actings in casting the soul upon <hi>C</hi>hrist, and likewise the di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stinction of Faith from Assurance, and how assurance may be clearly and firmly built upon a sound and a well-argued sense of its being and acting in the soul. In the Looking-glass of Assurance the soul beholds it self clinging and cleaving to <hi>C</hi>hrist while he is supporting and carrying it over the
<pb n="165" facs="unknown:000429_0182_0FA5B1FBDF12B640"/>
stormy Ocean to the haven of glory. It is Faith that seeds the Lamp of Assurance, and Assurance i<hi>s</hi> the Oil which feeds the Lamp of Joy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. We may argue the truth of our Faith by the fruits of holiness, and thence in<gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>err and draw forth Assurance. Because of the unseparable connexion there is be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Faith and holiness;<note place="margin">1 <hi>John</hi> 1. 7.</note> whoso walks in the light, the blood of Christ cleanseth him from all sin: that i<hi>s,</hi> whoever is san<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctified, may thence inferr, that he is justi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and shall be glorified. So <hi>Paul</hi> ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gues:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rom,</hi> 8. 30. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. 10, 11.</note> He that's washed and sanctified, is also justified in the name of the Lord Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sus, and shall inherit the Kingdom of <hi>G</hi>od. If we study to walk to all pleasing: we may then give thanks for that we are thereby made meet for the inheritance with the Saints in light.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Col.</hi>1. 10: 12.</note>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Again, Grace in exercise is a most evident token of its real existence, and may consequently raise Assurance. If a tree flower fragrntly, 'tis certain it has a root. If a <hi>S</hi>hip be under Sail, and its Top-gallants out, shews its found estate, and make<hi>s</hi> way towards its Ophir. To be strong and swift in motion demonstrates a strong and healthy soul, and is the way to keep it in a happy frame: for exercise conduces to health and Strength. Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of great rivers, by their voluble moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and tides, resist putrifaction and the heavenly bodies by their continual circu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and fiery beams convey their influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences to serve all the sublunary generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and accretions. Little sparks by a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gitation,
<pb n="166" facs="unknown:000429_0183_0FA5B1FCA6B73588"/>
conceive larger degrees of fire in the application of more combustible mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter and purifie the Air. Artificial imple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, as Locks, <hi>S</hi>aws and Handles, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> are made brighter by mutual affrication, attrition and use. So do the chariot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wheels of the soul kindle fire by swift rotation and motion in the ways of holi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness, and run flaming towards heaven.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. We may argue it from the good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>will of <hi>G</hi>od towards us, according to that in the Angelical Song [<hi>peace in earth, and good-will towards men</hi>] peace of conscience on scripture-ground is a certain token of Gods good-will towards us.<note place="margin">

                  <p>But if you ask: But will <hi>G</hi>od pardon me in particular</p>

                  <p n="6">6. Learn the blessed art of applying promises<hi>:</hi> this is a sure and certain way to argue out the point of Faith, and to infer assurance. He that can spiritually, apply a promise, ha<hi>s</hi> the Spirit of God, and acts in and by his vertue and instu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence. A promise in the reading sparkles and shines; but a promise applyed, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>forts and warmes. Some noble cordial as <hi>Alchermes,</hi> or that of <hi>Tycho</hi> or some great <hi>Elixir,</hi> if charily set up in a closet or a cabinet of chrystal is an help to the thoughts: but drunk or taken down in a proper vehicle, makes it by divine blessing
<pb n="168" facs="unknown:000429_0185_0FA5B1FE0DC5E100"/>
to become actually restorative. Could we repeat all the promises in the Bible, forward and backward, and reduce them upon occasion to proper head<hi>s</hi> and use, and service: yet 'tis special application gives the signative vertue: and therefore I shall endeavour by the help of grace to give in a little aid to this purpose.</p>
                  <p>First, <hi>Universals contain</hi> particulars of the same kind. Indefinite and unlimited promises are equivalent to universal in a necessary matter.

                  <p>The First or the irradiation of <hi>concurse</hi> is then dispensed when he shines upon our Argumentation: when we have laboured with our spirits, used Scripture mediums, and upon examination suited them to our hearts in their most inward sincere and humble searches; then comes the spirit of <hi>G</hi>od, and witnesses with our spirits that we are the children of <hi>G</hi>od.

Whence comes this, but from a secret love and liking that they have to those things which they believe to have. Because no man loves those things, which in his own opinion are not, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Therefore love and desire to believe, is Faith. <gap reason="illegible" resp="#AELD" extent="1 span">

Which Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments (sayes he) all the subtleties of infernal powers will never be able to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>solve.] Thus far he: to which let me, joyn, that since Faith of evidence (as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the foundation work) is therein more excellent than the Faith of Assurance, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the superstructure (tho I had rather

call it in Scripture terms the <hi>Assurance of Faith,</hi> since Assurance properly as I have often said is a distinct thing from Faith: tho common speech hath prevailed to make such a distinction; as if they were proper Members or Branches of true Faith. But let that pass, I say, if Christians would a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rise to high Assurance, they must lay their foundation strong and deep in the rock of evidence upon Christ himself. Evidence flows from a <hi>direct</hi> act; Assurance from a <hi>reflect:</hi> the one is like the view of the Suns body in the heaven, the other like his refle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction in the water, or on a Looking glass. Now all reflect rayes are weaker than the direct, and the reverse than the incident. But I speak not here of the Spirits work, and its most illustrious evidence: but of our workings upon the actings of our Faith. As to which the stronger our applications are to Christ, the stronger and more com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fortable will be the reflections upon them. For both rayes, the nearer the reverse and incident are in union, as in the depth of Summer, the heat and influence is the more strong and fervent, and so 'tis here:</p>
                  <p>But now it is high time to hearken to some Questions which troubled Soul<hi>s</hi> may bring in.</p>
                  <p>Quest. 1. The first Question may be: <hi>How may I be assured of the pardon of my sins, and consequently of Salvation?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> In answer to this, I shall lay down some Rules to clear it, which was the third thing premised in the beginning of this Chapter.</p>
                  <p n="1">
                     <pb n="192" facs="unknown:000429_0209_0FA5B2CADF07C190"/>
1. Forsaking of sin, with a holy endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to mortifie and subdue it,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Prov.</hi> 28. 13. <hi>Mic.</hi> 7 19. <hi>Rom</hi> 8. 13.</note> is a special sign of mercy.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. When after darknes<hi>s</hi> and conflicts, a begun renovation of life with a sincere care to continue it, is attended with some spring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of peace in conscience with God, this will prove an excellent token. For the blood of sprinkling upon the conscience speaks better than <hi>Abel</hi>'s blood:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. 24.</note> That cried out for condemnation; this for reconcilia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion with God.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. When we find some sweetness in our admissions to the Throne of <hi>G</hi>race. When our eye up to the Throne affects our heart at the threshold of <hi>G</hi>ods Sanctuary. When a bended knee and a melting heart work together. Then we may ask of God what ever we will, if according to his will: the precepts and the promises being the rule of asking. We have a most free access to plead the promises both of this and the life to come,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Eph.</hi> 3. 12. <hi>Heb.</hi> 4. 16. 1 <hi>Tim</hi> 4 8.</note> so that by holy degrees and steps we may arrive to further humble confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of divine mercy.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. When we feel some gracious risings of love to God, as pardoning our iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties for <hi>C</hi>hrists sake, and tho we do not so fully and sweetly feel it as we would: yet our hearts do pant and long after it. This is a true sign of Love.</p>
                  <p>But yet to clear it a little, the humble soul will ask,</p>
                  <p>Quest. <hi>How shall I know that I love God?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans:</hi> I answer, Of all the affections that spring and bubble out of the will, this is

most easily to bediscerned and known. Do you know the Sun, when you see him walk in brightness, do you know that you live by the actings of the senses and the pulsation of your arteries: or do you know that you walk when you move your feet, and feel your motions from place to place? you may as certainly know your affections and the workings of your Soul. This distin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guishes men from Bruits in the acting of their reason upon all they do, and in mana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging end<hi>s</hi> and means. The affections spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually beating, are the pulsations of the regenerate heart. Observe then your Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects: if you love the things above, better than all below;<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Col.</hi> 3. 2. <hi>Isal.</hi> 73. 25.</note> in your choice and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ference, tho sometimes under some ebb<hi>s</hi> and eclipse<hi>s:</hi> yet still you find an inward regard to God and his glory: and that you perform every action <hi>in ordine ad Deum,</hi> and love all as to the inward sincerity of your heart:<note place="margin">1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 10. 31.</note> and enjoy every relation with some desire to work up your mercies to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards God in thankfulness and usefulness. These are good tokens that you are risen with Christ by Faith, and that your life is hid with <hi>G</hi>od in him, and that by continued degrees of Sanctification, you shall at last arrive to this, even to appear with him in Glory.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. But that I may at length wind out of this delightful Labyrinth in discoursing a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout Assurance; Let us hearken to the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond Question, wherein the Soul being somewhat revived does now start the fourth Particular at the beginning; and that is,</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="194" facs="unknown:000429_0211_0FA5B2CC5C95D348"/>
Quest, 2. <hi>How may I preserve and retain Assurance when it is gained?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Ans.</hi> The reason of this Question arises not only from hence, because the sweet sense of divine love is a most desirable frame of Spirit, and fills the soul to the brim with joy and peace in the Holy Ghost; and besides renders persons very service<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able and greatly honours Religion: But also because,</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Many gracious persons that have true Faith, yet labour under deep fears of Hypo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crisie, arising from their pious Education, not answered by proportionable holiness. It puts great jealousies in their hearts, that all they have done, is but a forced work, and a habit of formality; attracted from the precepts of godly Ministers and Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rents, instilling into an inlightned consci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence the frightful form of an outward conversation consonant: and therefore fear at a strange rate that their diamonds are but as it were from the soft Rock of St. <hi>Vincent,</hi> their Gold, but Alchymy, their Faith but fained and temporary.</p>
                  <p>But be not discouraged: For that Faith is true and unfeigned, which proceeds from a pure heart,<note place="margin">1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 1. 5, 19.</note> and a good conscience, that is, without fraud and guilt, in setting it na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ked and open before God,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Act</hi> 24. 16.</note> in labouring and exercising to keep a good conscience in sight of God and Men. You may then re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joyce in the testimony of such a conscience, having been upright before him in the main bent of the soul,<note place="margin">

What tho thou didst not come in with such remarkable pangs; no more did <hi>Za<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cheus</hi> nor <hi>Lydia.</hi> Tis not the manner but the truth of our coming in to Christ, is the great point, if thou constantly adhere to the Lord with full purpose of heart.<note place="margin">

                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. This question begs a full answer: because, though want of Assurance does not denote an unbeliever, yet it keeps a true believer under the dark shade<hi>s</hi> of fear and sorrow. Assurance besides, in the best of Saints is but an imperfect work, because our Faith it self is but im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perfect: we see but in part, because we do but trust in part.

<pb n="222" facs="unknown:000429_0239_0FA5B2EBE9202708"/>
for we see and find that we are all too apt by the sad inclination of the old <hi>Adam</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in us, to love and embrace any temporary comfort above and beyond him, and then to few the old fig-leaf excuses to hide our na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kedness from his all-searching eye: some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times we make Idols of Relations, if sweet tempered and pleasant like <hi>Jonathan</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> and so incite God to take them a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way in displeasure, and to plant sower, dirty and crabbed tempers in their room; and yet 'ti<hi>s</hi> in a mixture of mercy to wean us more to himself: for very few have the wit and grace to set God on the Throne in the midst of their hearts,<note place="margin">

Let's pray our heavenly Father, and beg it ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nestly, that if he will please to purge away our former miscarriages, and indulge such mercies to us in our pilgrimage; that he would please also to teach, help and incite our hearts to love him best, and above all, and love none but as foot-stools to advance our hearts the more to him, and to improve all in order to him. Then are we more likely to keep and enjoy our mercies, and tast more of God in them all, till the bles<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed time of our ascention to his bosom.</p>
