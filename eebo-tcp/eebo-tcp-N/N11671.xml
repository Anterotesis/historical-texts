            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>INASMUCH as this Town is of ancient date, and, compared with moſt of the Towns in this County, even with the Shire-Town itſelf, is like an elder Matron amidſt a group of youngerly Females; and inaſmuch as it has been famous for Indian inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, Indian wars, and Indian barbarities, I have for a conſiderable time felt a ſtrong inclination and deſire
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:014754_0004_0F94DAA139F0DAF0"/>
to ſearch into it's hiſtory—to find out it's origin— the difficulties and hardſhips of it's firſt Engliſh inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants—it's gradual increaſe and progreſſive improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. In ſhort, I wiſhed to be acquainted with whatever was curious, entertaining or inſtructive in the circumſtances of the town, and the tranſactions or ſufferings of it's early ſettlers. With this view I have ſearched all the hiſtories of the country I could meet with—enquired for manuſcripts that might have preſerved a circumſtantial account of ſome occurrences which the printed hiſtories are wholly ſilent <hi>about,</hi> or give but a general ſketch <hi>of.</hi> I have conſulted many of the deſcendants of the firſt ſettlers, and thoſe that have been moſt acquainted with the affairs of the town. I have peruſed records, &amp;c. But the reſult of my enquiries does not wholly ſatisfy my curioſity or anſwer my wiſh. No intelligence is to be obtained concerning ſome things that have happened; and many circumſtances relative to divers events that might have been entertaining at this day, have not been handed down by tradition. Our anceſtors were under great diſadvantages as to making extenſive obſervations, or keeping exact records, or preſerving them for the peruſal of poſterity. However, I have gleaned a few things relative to the ſettling and ſubſequent improvements of this town, which may ſerve as a clue to trace the conduct of divine provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence—to point out many inſtances of the divine goodneſs—to lead our minds to ſome religious reflec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions—to excite gratitude in our hearts for the won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derful works which God hath done for us and our fathers—to encourage our hope and truſt in the ſame power and goodneſs to protect and bleſs us and our poſterity—and to engage us to <hi>keep his commandments.</hi>

               <pb n="7" facs="unknown:014754_0005_0F94DAA1FA3467E8"/>It was the practice of God's people of old not only to be glad for the great things which He did for them and their country—to praiſe the Lord for his goodneſs, and to talk of his doings, but to preſerve memorials, or written accounts of the intereſting events that took place with reſpect to their nation— the moſt remarkable interpoſitions of Providence in their favor, and to tranſmit them to their children and future generations, for their notice, inſtruction and excitation to gratitude and a becoming conduct. This is apparent from the words of the Pſalmiſt in my text, as well as from many other paſſages in the ſacred writings. <hi>I will utter dark ſayings of old</hi>—Things wonderful and myſterious, performed in ancient times, and in danger of being forgotten, but which ought to be had in everlaſting remembrance. <hi>Which we have heard and known, and our fathers have told us. We will not hide them from their children</hi>—we will make known thoſe remarkable providences both to their poſterity and our's; to the generation now on the ſtage, and to that which is to ariſe; <hi>ſhewing to the generation to come the praiſes of the Lord and his ſtrength, and his wonderful works that he hath done</hi>— thoſe mighty and merciful works which deſerve per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petual praiſe and thankſgiving. <hi>That the generation to come might know them, even the children which ſhould be born; who ſhould ariſe and declare them to their children; that they might ſet their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments</hi>—that by reviewing paſt tranſactions, and conſidering what God had heretofore done for his people, they might be led to place their truſt and dependence upon the ſame wiſe and gracious Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, and might conduct in a manner anſwerable to
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:014754_0006_0F94DAA2B9EC23E8"/>
ſuch benefits.—And it has not been unuſual in this country (which was planted, and has ſince been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved, protected and proſpered in a manner almoſt as aſtoniſhing, and by a power almoſt as viſibly divine, as was that of the children of Iſrael) it has not been unuſual in this country, at ſome remarkable periods, to look back upon paſt events, to rehearſe the paſt dealings of God, and to republiſh ſome pages of hiſtory out of the book of Providence, to refreſh the minds and entertain and gladden the hearts of thoſe that were then on the ſtage, and alſo for the inſtruc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and benefit of thoſe that were to come; <hi>that they might not forget the works of God; but might ſet their hope in God, and keep his commandments.</hi>—And ſince the providence of God has not only been concerned, but his goodneſs in a variety of inſtances has been viſible, in the growth and increaſe of this Town. amidſt the difficulties which the firſt chriſtianized planters had to encounter, I thought a Sermon <hi>to bring to remembrance</hi> might be ſeaſonable, entertaining and profitable. Such a Sermon I had propoſed with myſelf to have delivered the 2d day of laſt Auguſt, being the day that juſt compleated a century from the time that <hi>Brookfield</hi> was laid in aſhes by the cruel ſavages of the wilderneſs. But the public diſtreſſes and confuſions, that burſt in ſuch a ſtorm upon this Country laſt ſpring and ſummer, prevented my executing my deſign. But not willing it ſhould prove wholly abortive, I thought it might be acceptable to deliver ſuch a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe on the laſt day of the year—a day proper for reviewing paſt time, and ſtrengthning our faith, hope and truſt in God, and quickening our obedience, by recollecting the paſt dealings of God with our anceſtors and ourſelves—and a day rendered remarkable by its

being the anniverſary of that ſabbath which our pious anceſtors, the firſt ſettlers of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> firſt obſerved in ſocial worſhip in the place of their intended habitation: which being December 31, 1620, is juſt 155 years from this day.</p>
            <p>I cannot find exactly at how early a period the firſt <hi>Engliſh</hi> ſettlements began in this town, nor who the perſons were that began them. A tribe of Indians were the original inhabitants; nor did they move off <hi>before,</hi> or <hi>at</hi> the coming of the white people; but both <hi>Engliſh</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> lived together in friendſhip for ſome time.<note n="*" place="bottom">Theſe Indians were commonly called <hi>Quaboag</hi> Indians. Governor <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> in his Hiſtory ſays, the <hi>Nipnet</hi> or <hi>Nipmuck</hi> Indians ambuſh'd the party that went to treat with them at <hi>Meminimiſſet.</hi> I ſuppoſe it was in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction with the Indians of <hi>Quaboag.</hi> For theſe, par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taking in the uneaſineſs and commotion that <hi>Philip</hi> was endeavoring to excite among all the tribes through the country, and growing ſomewhat ſhy of their Engliſh neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bors, and taking offence at ſome damages they had ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from their cattle, they quitted their lands here juſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the war broke out, and went up to <hi>Meminimiſſet,</hi> and aſſiſted in the above mentioned ambuſcade and in burn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Brookfield.</hi> After which they returned no more, unleſs for miſchief; but ſcattered among other Indians till they were no more diſtinguiſhed or known.</note> It is certain there were <hi>Engliſh</hi> inhabitants here many years before there were any between this place and <hi>Marlborough</hi> on the Eaſt, <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi> River on the Weſt, and <hi>Canada</hi> on the North.</p>
            <p>In the year 1660, i. e. 40 years after the firſt ſettlement of <hi>Plimouth,</hi> and upwards of 115 years ago<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſeveral of the inhabitants of <hi>Ipſwich</hi> petitioned the Great and General Court for a grant of land in theſe
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:014754_0008_0F94DAA43995E1E0"/>
parts. The Court granted them 6 miles ſquare, or ſo much land as ſhould be contained in ſuch a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paſs, near <hi>Quaboag</hi> Pond, upon certain conditions <note n="†" place="bottom">The anſwer to the petition is as follows: "At a great and general court of election held at Boſton the 20th of May 1660. In anſwer to a petition of ſeveral inhabitants of <hi>Ipſwich;</hi> this court judgeth it meet to grant the petitioners 6 miles ſquare, or ſo much land as ſhall be contained in ſuch a compaſs, in a place near Quaboag pond, provided they have 20 families there reſident within 3 years, and that they have an able miniſter ſettled there within the ſaid term, ſuch as this court ſhall approve; and that they make due proviſion in ſome way or other for the future, either by ſetting apart of lands, or what elſe ſhall be thought meet for the continuance of the miniſtry among them." I inſert this, principally as a ſpecimen of the pious principles that actuated our anceſtors, and the care which the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive body took that new ſettlements ſhould have the goſpel and the adminiſtration of the ordinances among them as early, as ſtatedly and as regularly as poſſible. And no doubt it is owing to this care, under providence, that the country flouriſhed ſo greatly both in ſpirituals and temporals: For it hath been often obſerved that no people was ever the poorer, but on the contrary flouriſhed the faſter for main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining the goſpel miniſtry among them. And it is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly owing to the wiſe and pious proviſion of our laws and civil eſtabliſhment obliging pariſhes to ſettle and ſupport evangelical and learned miniſters, that the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of <hi>Maſſachuſetts-Bay, Connecticut</hi> and <hi>New-Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhire,</hi> are ſo much better inſtructed in the things of reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion, and are ſo much more remarkable for the ſtrict obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation of the ſabbath, and for good morals, than thoſe of moſt of the other colonies. How prepoſterous then is it for any to complain of this as a hardſhip and burden! And if any would wiſh to alter the civil conſtitution and laws reſpecting this matter, muſt they not be conſidered as either ignorantly or wilfully unfriendly both to the civil and reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gious intereſts of their country?</note> This was the legal origin of the town. Theſe men,

But this is not material. It is certain that from ſmall and early beginnings, the ſettlement increaſed, even under the diſadvantages and diſcou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragements of that day, ſo that upon application made to the General Court in the year 1673, the inhabitants were incorporated into a Townſhip by the name of <hi>Brookfield.</hi>
               <note n="*" place="bottom">The Act of incorporation bears date October 15, 1673.</note> And in the year 1675, when the town was burnt, they had at leaſt 20 families, a meeting-houſe, and preaching, though no ſettled miniſter.— The circumſtances of it's deſolation I ſhall relate chiefly in the words of the late Governor <hi>Hutchinſon,</hi> in his Hiſtory of the Maſſachuſetts Bay. "The Nipnet, or Nipmuck Indians, had killed 4 or 5 people at Mendon in the Maſſachuſetts Colony the 14th of July 1675. The Governor and Council, in hopes of reclaiming the Nipnets, ſent Captain <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> with 20 horſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men to <hi>Quaboag</hi> (Brookfield) near which place there was to be a great rendezvous of thoſe Indians. The Inhabitants of Brookfield had been deluded with the promiſe of a treaty at a place agreed upon the 2d of Auguſt. Some of the principal of them accompanied Captain <hi>Hutchinſon</hi> thither.<note n="‖" place="bottom">The place was at the head of <hi>Wickaboug</hi> pond. Some of the company, when they found the Indians were not come according to agreement, ſuſpected treachery and adviſed immediately to return. Others putting too much confidence in their fidelity, urged to proceed, which they accordingly did till they fell into the ambuſhment.</note> Not finding the Indians
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:014754_0010_0F94DAA5B992A1D8"/>
there, they rode forward about 4 or 5 miles towards the Nipnets chief town. When they came to a place called Meminimiſſet, a narrow paſſage between a ſteep hill and a thick ſwamp, they were ambuſhed by 2 or 300 Indians, who ſhot down 8 of the company, and mortally wounded 3 more, Captain Hutchinſon being one of the number. The reſt eſcaped through a by path to Quaboag. The Indians flocked into the town; but the inhabitants being alarmed, had all gathered together in the principal houſe. They had the mortification to ſee all their dwelling-houſes, about 20, with all their barns and out-houſes burnt. The houſe where they had aſſembled was then ſurrounded, and a variety of attempts were made to ſet fire to it. At length the Indians filled a cart with hemp and other combuſtible matter, which they kindled; and whilſt they were thruſting it towards the houſe, a violent ſhower of rain fell ſuddenly and extinguiſhed the fire. [This is according to Mr. Hubbard. Mr. Mather takes no notice of the rain, but ſays Willard came upon the Indians and prevented the execution." This latter account is neareſt the truth.] "Auguſt 4th Major Willard, who had been ſent after ſome other Indians weſtward, heard of the diſtreſs of Brookfield when he was about 4 or 5 miles from Lancaſter, which cauſed him to alter his courſe; and the ſame night he reached Brookfield, after 30 miles march. And though the Indian ſcouts diſcovered him and fired their alarm guns, yet the main body, from their high joy, always accompanied with a horrid noiſe, heard them not. Willard joined the beſieged, and the Indians immediately poured in all the ſhot they could, but without execution, and then quitted the ſiege, and deſtroyed all the horſes and cattle they
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:014754_0011_0F94DAA679ECA8B8"/>
could find, and then withdrew to their dens. They were not purſued, being much ſuperior in number."<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <p>It may not be amiſs to add to the above account the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing particulars, viz. That three of the men who were killed in the ambuſhment belonged to <hi>Brookfield,</hi> viz. Captain <hi>John Ayres, John Coye</hi> and <hi>Joſeph Pritchard:</hi>— That when the Indians purſued the party into the town, they ſet fire to all the buildings except a few in the neighborhood of the houſe in which the inhabitants had taken ſhelter:—That they endeavored to intercept 5 or 6 men that had gone to a neighboring houſe to ſecure ſome things there; but they all got ſafe to the place of refuge, except a young man, <hi>Samuel Pritchard</hi> who was ſtopped ſhort by a fatal bullet:—That the houſe in which they were beſieged was unfortified, except by a few logs haſtily tumbled up on the outſide after the alarm, and by a few feather beds hung up on the inſide. And though the ſiege continued ſeveral days, in which time innumerable balls entered the houſe, only one man, <hi>Henry Young,</hi> who was in the chamber, was killed.—The Indians ſhot many fire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>arrows to burn the houſe; but without effect. And on one night the beſieged were ſurprized by a ſudden light without doors, and ſoon perceived that the Indians had placed a quantity of combuſtibles by the ſide of the houſe and ſet them on fire. And tho' the people were obliged to go out and draw water to extinguiſh the flames, and were all the while expoſed as marks to the enemy's bullets, yet they ſaved the houſe without any one's being hurt.— During the ſiege one man was wounded as he was drawing water. A board fence hid him from the Indians: but one of them ſeeing the well-pole drawing down, took aim at the place where he thought the man muſt ſtand, and ſtruck him juſt under the chin. The man affrighted, bawl'd out that he was kill'd. The Indian, knowing his voice, ſhouted and ſaid, "Me kill Major <hi>Wilſon.</hi>"—When the troop which relieved <hi>Brookfield</hi> got into the town, which was late at night, they were joined by great numbers of cattle, that had collected together in their fright at the conflagra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the buildings, and the firing and war-whoops of the Indians; and for protection theſe poor animals followed the troop till they arrived at the beſieged houſe. The Indians deceived hereby, and thinking there was a much larger number of horſemen than there really was, immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately ſet fire to the barn belonging to the beſieged houſe, and to <hi>Joſeph Pritchard</hi>'s houſe and barn and the meeting-houſe, which were the only buildings left unburnt, and went off. A garriſon was maintained at this houſe till winter, when the court ordered the people away, ſoon after which the Indians came and burnt this houſe alſo.</p>
                  <p>Long as this note is, I cannot conclude without ſaying ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing concerning Major <hi>Willard,</hi> the celebrated deliverer of the people here. His conduct in altering his courſe and coming to the relief of <hi>Brookfield,</hi> being dictated by humanity and executed with bravery and ſucceſs, has gained him the applauſe of people in general. But as it was beſide his orders, he was cenſured by the Court and caſhiered, which diſguſted his friends and broke his heart. And though the puniſhment may ſeem too rigorous, yet it ought to be remembered, that if commanders of parties, ſent upon particular expeditions, may take liberty to vary from their expreſs orders, nothing effectual could be accompliſhed, and only confuſion, diſappointment, loſs, and in many caſes ruin would be likely to enſue.</p>

                  <p>For the information of thoſe who may wiſh to know, I would ſay ſomething concerning the conſtitution of this Town. Though the inhabitants were incorporated and the town named by the court as early as the year 1673, yet they were not allowed the powers and authorities of a town till the year 1718: But the court appointed and continued a committee conſiſting of gentlemen belonging to other places, to direct, regulate and ratify all affairs relative to ſettling and building up the town. So that without ſaid committee the inhabitants could not take up for themſelves, or grant to others, any lands. And it was by the direction and aſſiſtance of ſaid committee, that monies were granted, a meeting-houſe built, a miniſter choſen, &amp;c.—To encourage the ſettling of the town, eſpecially in the time of the Indian wars, lands were granted to divers perſons upon condition they would poſſeſs and improve them for a certain number of years. The firſt grant of any lands I find on record is to <hi>Joſeph Woolcot,</hi> and bears date February 24th 1687.</p>

years, <hi>Brookfield,</hi> as well as many other towns; was greatly harraſſed and annoyed; the Indians frequently making ſudden inroads, killing and ſcalping, or cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivating one and another of the inhabitants—women and children fleeing like frighted birds to the fortified houſes; nor had they always time to eſcape. During this war 12 or 13 men were killed, 6 at one time.

                  <p>I cannot obtain information enough to enable me to point out the exact order of time, or the day, month or year in which ſome of the ſkirmiſhes and ſlaughters happened in this town.

                     </gap>. A party of Indians came into the town and broke up two or three families. <hi>Joſeph Woolcot</hi> being at work a little diſtance from his houſe, his wife being fearful took her children and went out to him. When they returned to the houſe at noon they found the Indians had been there, for his gun and ſeveral other things were miſſing. And looking out at a window he ſaw an Indian at ſome diſtance coming towards the houſe. He immediately ſent out his wife and his two little daughters to hide themſelves in the buſhes; and he taking his little ſon under his arm and his broad ax in his hand, went out with his dog in ſight of the Indian. The dog being large and fierce, attacked the Indian ſo furiouſly, that he was obliged to diſcharge his gun at the dog to rid himſelf of him: immediately upon which <hi>Woolcot</hi> ſat down the child and purſued the Indian till he heard the bullet roll down his gun (the Indian charging as he ran) he then turn'd back, ſnatch'd up his child and made his eſcape through the ſwamps to a fort. His wife being greatly terrified, diſcovered by her ſhricks where ſhe was; and the Indian ſoon found and diſpatched both her and her children. Others of the party about the ſame time came into the houſe of one <hi>Maſen,</hi> while the family were at dinner. They killed <hi>Maſon</hi> and one or two children, and took his wife and an infant which they had wounded, and carried them off. They alſo took two brothers, <hi>Thomas</hi> and <hi>Daniel Lawrence:</hi> they ſoon diſpatched <hi>Thomas,</hi> pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending he had miſinformed them about the number of men that were in the town. <hi>John Lawrence,</hi> their brother, rode with all haſte to <hi>Springfield</hi> for aſſiſtance. A com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany under the command of Captain <hi>Coulton</hi> came with the greateſt ſpeed and purſued the Indians. They found Mrs. <hi>Maſon</hi>'s child, which the Savages had knock'd on the head and thrown away in the buſhes; and continuing their purſuit, they came upon the Indians encampment, which was a ſort of bruſh hedge, which they deridingly called "<hi>Engliſhmen</hi>'s fort." The party waited till break of day, and then came ſo near as to put their guns through this bruſh and fire upon the Indians, 14 or 15 of whom were killed, the reſt fled with ſuch precipitation as to leave ſeveral of their arms, blankets, powder-horns, &amp;c. and their priſoners, <hi>Daniel Lawrence</hi> and Mrs. <hi>Maſon,</hi> whom our men conducted back.—This ſame <hi>John Lawrence,</hi> who rode expreſs and procured the company that reſcued the above mentioned priſoners, was afterwards going in com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany with one <hi>Samuel Owen</hi> in ſearch of a man that was miſſing: the Indians came upon them, killed <hi>Lawrence,</hi> but <hi>Owen</hi> eſcaped.—<hi>Mary McIntoſh</hi> was ſired upon and killed as ſhe was milking her cows.—<hi>Robert Grainger</hi> and <hi>John Clary</hi> were paſſing along the road on a certain day and being fired upon by the Savages, <hi>Grainger</hi> was killed on the ſpot; <hi>Clary</hi> attempted to eſcape, but had not fled far before he alſo was ſhot down.—At another time <hi>Thomas Battis</hi> of <hi>Brookfield</hi> riding expreſs to <hi>Hadley,</hi> was killed in the wilderneſs, in a place now called <hi>Belcher-Town.</hi>— Early one morning <hi>John Woolcot,</hi> a lad about 12 or 14 years old, was riding in ſearch of the cows, when the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians fired at him, killed his horſe under him and took him priſoner.

The Engliſh ſaw not their danger till they ſaw there was no eſcaping it. And therefore, knowing that an Indian could not look an Engliſhman in the face and take a right aim, they ſtood their ground, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſenting their pieces wherever they ſaw an Indian without diſcharging them, excepting <hi>Abijah Bartlet,</hi> who turned to flee and was ſhot dead. The Indians kept firing at the reſt, and wounded three of them, <hi>Joſeph Jennings</hi> in two places; one ball grazed the top of his head, by which he was ſtruck blind for a moment; another ball paſſed thro' his ſhoulder, wounding his collar bone; yet by neither did he fall, nor was mortally wounded. <hi>Benjamin Jennings</hi> was wounded in the leg, and <hi>John Green</hi> in the wriſt. They were preſerved at laſt by the following ſtratagem. A large dog hearing the firing came to our men; one of whom, to encourage his brethren and intimidate the Indians, called out "Captain <hi>Williams</hi> is come to our aſſiſtance, for here is his dog." The Indians ſeeing the dog, and know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing <hi>Williams</hi> to be a famous warrior immediately fled, and our men eſcaped. <hi>John Woolcot,</hi> the lad above-mentioned, was carried to <hi>Canada,</hi> where he remained ſix or ſeven years, during which time, by converſing wholly with Indians, he not only entirely loſt his native language, but became ſo naturalized to the ſavages, as to be unwil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling for a while to return to his native country. Some years afterwards, viz. in March 172<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>, in a time of peace, he and another man having been hunting, and coming down <hi>Connecticut</hi> river with a freight of ſkins and furr, they were hail'd by ſome Indians; but not being willing to go to them, they ſteered for another ſhore. The Indians landed at a little diſtance from them; ſeveral ſhots were exchanged, at length <hi>Woolcot</hi> was killed.</p>
                  <p>The laſt miſchief which was done by the Savages in <hi>Brookfield</hi> was about the 20th of July 1710. Six men, viz. <hi>Ebenezer Hayward, John White, Stephen</hi> and <hi>Benjamin Jennings, John Groſvenor,</hi> and <hi>Joſeph Kellog</hi> were making hay in the meadows, when the Indians, who had been watching an opportunity to ſurprize them, ſprung ſuddenly upon them, diſpatched five of them, and took the other <hi>(John White)</hi> priſoner. <hi>White</hi> ſpying a ſmall company of our people at ſome diſtance, jump'd from the Indian that held him and ran to join his friends; but the Indian fired after him, and wounded him in the thigh, by which he fell; but ſoon recovering and running again, he was again fired at and received his death wound.</p>

He was a gentleman of great benevolence; and his public adminiſtrations were ſerious, and calculated to edify and benefit his hearers.—That part which ſtill retained the denomination of the firſt church and precinct obtained the conſent of Mr. <hi>Joſeph Parſons</hi> to adminiſter the word and ordinances ſtatedly among them, which he was regularly authoriſed to do by an ordaining council, November 23, 1757. He continued in the miniſtry upwards of 13 years, though bodily infirmities increaſed upon him to that degree as to diſable him from carrying on the work for about 3 years before his death. He was releaſed from his pains and received to his reward, January 17, 1771, in the 14th year of his miniſtry and 38th of

his age. He was a gentleman of ſprightly powers, an accurate reaſoner, and a ſenſible preacher—In his life a promoter of peace and order, and an example of the chriſtian virtues—In his ſickneſs, a pattern of patience and reſignation—and in his death, ſtrong in faith and full of hope. The bereaved flock did not long continue deſtitute of the ſtated adminiſtration of the ordinances; but, <hi>ſtudying the things which make for peace, and the things wherewith one might edify another,</hi> they ſoon united in the choice of Mr. <hi>Ephraim Ward</hi> for their miniſter; and he was inſtated in the paſtoral office the 23d of October 1771, where we hope he will continue for a long time an ornament to the miniſtry, and a peculiar bleſſing to his flock.— The Rev. Mr. <hi>Forbes</hi> continued in the faithful diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the miniſterial work amongſt the people of the ſecond precinct almoſt 23 years; and on the firſt of March 1775 the paſtoral relation was diſſolved by mutual conſent, under the conduct of an eccleſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>aſtical council, each party in charity with, and heartily recommending the other.—A church was embodied in this third precinct, April 15, 1756, when 25 males and 14 females ſubſcribed a church covenant. And on the 24th of May 1758, I was honored by being put into the miniſtry in this place.</p>
            <p>And now having run through the various ſtages of the town ſince it's firſt ſettlement, let us turn about and review the ſteps we have taken, that we may leiſurely obſerve the kind hand of Providence direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, ſupporting, defending and proſpering our anceſtors and their ſucceſſors down to the preſent day. When we conſider the many Indian wars, and ſome of them of long continuance, which have harraſſed and diſtreſſed
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:014754_0021_0F94DAADF99E59D8"/>
New-England, and often driven in and broken up the out-ſettlements for many miles, we can't but wonder that the whole country, as well as the frontiers, and this town in particular, was not crampt and kept from flouriſhing much more than it was. In how many inſtances, and at how many times, might our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers ſet up an <hi>Ebenezer,</hi> and ſay, <hi>hitherto hath the Lord helped us?</hi> When the inhabitants both of this town and of this country <hi>were few in number, yea very few, and ſtrangers in it,</hi> how eaſily might the Savages, which were very numerous have <hi>ſwallowed them up quick, when their wrath was kindled againſt them?</hi> But the Lord was on our ſide; he reſtrained the wrath of the Heathen, and gave their lands into the hands of our fathers for a poſſeſſion. With what amazing ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pidity has this country increaſed under the patronage of Jehovah, whoſe kingdom ruleth over all, <hi>who forſaketh not his ſaints,</hi> and hath engaged <hi>that the righteous ſhall inherit the land and dwell therein forever.</hi>
               <note n="†" place="bottom">Should the inhabitants of the American Colonies increaſe in the ſame proportion they have done, or according to the common eſtimate of doubling once in 25 years, they would in about 50 years from this time, be almoſt double in number to the preſent inhabitants of <hi>England.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>But my buſineſs at this time is not ſo much with the country in general, having in the forenoon con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered it's growth and increaſe through formidable difficulties and diſcouragements. Let us confine our view to our own town: And we need not go back 60 years to find the beginning of it's church-ſtate. Sixty years ago there was no meeting-houſe, nor ſettled miniſter in the town. And when the inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants had built a houſe for the worſhip of God, they had no occaſion for galleries for the people to
<pb n="24"
                   facs="unknown:014754_0022_0F94DAAEB9A89AD8"
                   rendition="simple:additions"/>
fit in, though the houſe was not large. But now, not to reckon a great part of <hi>Weſtern,</hi> which was then <hi>Brookfield,</hi> but was ſet off about 35 years ago, nor a conſiderable number of families which joined with others to form the diſtrict of <hi>New-Braintree,</hi> about 25 years ago, there are within this town three diſtinct pariſhes, the leaſt of which contains upwards of 100 families—three commodious well-finiſhed meeting-houſes—three regular congregational churches—and in the whole town at leaſt 3000 ſouls.—It would have been pleaſing to a curious mind to have known the exact number of births, deaths, baptiſms and admiſſions to full communion, ſince the commencement of the town: But this I find impoſſible to aſcertain; becauſe records of theſe things have not been pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerved. The birth of earlieſt date that I find upon record is in the year 1701.<note n="*" place="bottom">
                  <hi>Mary Bartlet,</hi> daughter to <hi>Benjamin</hi> and <hi>Mary Bartlet,</hi> born May 6, 1701.</note> As to deaths, even ſince a book was kept, many people have been, and are ſtill, negligent in tranſmitting an account of them to the town-clerk. And as to church records, I cannot find that any were kept in Mr. <hi>Cheney</hi>'s or Mr. <hi>Harding</hi>'s day. During the Rev. Mr. <hi>Parſons</hi>'s miniſtry 203 were baptized in the firſt church; and ſince the Rev. Mr. <hi>Ward</hi>'s ordination 87, in all 290. In the ſecond church ſince it's incorporation I find the record of 426 baptiſms. Since my ſettlement 366 have been baptized in this church; 98 admitted to full communion which added to the 39 which were firſt embodied, make 137: 19 of which are dead, and 15 diſmiſſed to other churches. So that there are now 103 members of this third church.—Of this town therefore, as well as of the country in general,
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:014754_0023_0F94DAAF799A5298"/>
we may ſay, <hi>though thy beginning is ſmall, yet thy latter end is greatly increaſed.</hi> And we may adopt the pious wiſh of the Pſalmiſt, <hi>the Lord increaſe you more and more, you and your children,</hi> and that from generation to ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration. Eſpecially have we reaſon to wiſh and pray, and endeavor, that <hi>the children which ſhall be born, ſhall be a ſeed to ſerve the Lord, that ſhall be accounted unto him for a generation</hi>: and that <hi>they ſhall come and declare his righteouſneſs unto a people that ſhall be born, that he hath done this.</hi> For as to the preſent gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, is there not reaſon to fear, that it is, in many reſpects, degenerated from that regularity of behavior, that family-decorum and religion, and that love to divine ordinances, for which our fore-fathers were remarkable? At the leaſt, every one muſt allow, that there is great room, and great occaſion for amendment. To increaſe in numbers, in wealth, in elegance and refinements, and at the ſame time to increaſe in luxury, profaneneſs, impiety, and a diſeſteem of things ſacred, is to go backward and not forward. 'Tis worſe than mortgaging one's eſtate to buy gewgaws.</p>
            <p>'Tis with pleaſing wonder that we look back both upon this country in general, and this town in parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular, and compare the preſent condition and appearance with what they were a century, yea but little more than half a century ago. Inſtead of a deſolate un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cultivated wilderneſs—inſtead of mountains and plains covered with thick untraverſed woods—and ſwamps hideous and impaſſable, the face of the earth is trim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, and adorned with a beautiful variety of fields, meadows, orchards and paſtures. <hi>The deſart bloſſoms as the roſe: the little hills rejoice on every ſide; the paſtures are clothed with flocks, the valleys alſo are
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:014754_0024_0F94DAB039BAF9F8"/>
covered over with corn; they ſhout for joy, they alſo ſing.</hi> Inſtead of the dreary haunts of ſavage beaſts, and more ſavage men, wounding the ear, and terrifying the heart with their diſmal yells, we find now only harmleſs retreats, <hi>where the fowls of heaven have their habitation which ſing among the branches.</hi> Inſtead of the ſmoaky huts and wigwams of naked, ſwarthy barbarians, we now behold thick ſettlements of a civilized people, and convenient and elegant buildings. In fine, our hearts are now gladdened at the ſight of noble edifices reared in honor, and to promote the worſhip and ſervice of the true God, near to the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hallowed grounds where Satan's ſeat once was. This affords a noble pleaſure in the contemplation. But how much greater would be our pleaſure, if our improvements in benevolence and piety, in all the moral and chriſtian virtues, had kept pace with our improvements in arts, agriculture, and all the elegances of life?—If, as we multiplied temples made with hands, we had taken care that our bodies and ſouls had become living temples for the reſidence of the bleſſed Spirit?</p>
            <p>That we have increaſed and multiplied and turned a wilderneſs into a fruitful field, muſt be aſcribed with gratitude to that God who <hi>increaſeth the nations and deſtroyeth them; who enlargeth the nations and ſtrait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth them again. O bleſs our God ye people, and make the voice of his praiſe to be heard: who holdeth our ſoul in life and ſuffereth not our feet to be moved. Aſcribe ye ſtrength unto God: his excellency is over Iſrael, and his ſtrength is in the clouds. The God of Iſrael is he that giveth ſtrength and power unto his people: bleſſed be God.</hi> Every time we diſcover any

veſtiges of the aboriginals—any of the points of their arrows, or fragments of their more harmleſs utenſils —any hillocks where their bones are depoſited—or any remains of their haunts or fortreſſes, we ſhould not only remember the dangers and ſufferings which thoſe underwent, who firſt began a ſettlement here, and laid a foundation for the fair inheritances and peaceful habitations we now poſſeſs, but we ſhould cheriſh a grateful ſenſe of theſe favors as coming from God; and give thanks to him who <hi>has been our habitation in all generations.</hi> When we now walk abroad upon buſineſs or pleaſure, we are <hi>not afraid of the terror by night, nor for the arrow which flyeth by day.</hi> We are not anxious leſt the frightful Savage ſhould ſpring from his thicket with his murderous tomahawk, or drive the leaden death through our bodies before we are aware; nor leſt, when we return home, we ſhould find our dwellings in aſhes, our <hi>little ones daſhed againſt the ſtones</hi> and our wives carried captive through a perilous, dreadful wilderneſs, by thoſe whoſe tender mercies are cruelty. We can now walk in ſafety over thoſe very grounds which once were ſtained with the blood, and rendered horrid to the ſight by the mangled carcaſſes, of ſome of our anceſtors. <hi>Surely his ſalvation is nigh them that fear him, that glory may dwell in our land, The Lord is the portion of our inheritance and of our cup: thou maintaineſt our lot. The lines are fallen to us in pleaſant places, yea we have a goodly heritage.</hi>— But is there not ſomething that imbitters the reliſh and leſſens the value of theſe poſſeſſions and enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments? are not the dangers and diſtreſſes, the cruelties and ſufferings, which our fore-fathers underwent, renewed in part in our day, and practiſed upon ſome of
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:014754_0026_0F94DAB1BA7EBF28"/>
their poſterity? But what do I ſay? Are the deceaſed tribes of Indians riſen out of their graves with their hatchets and bows, that our properties wear ſuch a face of uncertainty, and we tremble at what may be the deſtiny of ourſelves, of our children, and dear con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nexions? Or has any other nation of a fierce counte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, a hard language and harder hearts, invaded our territories? Who are they that with cruel hands, have, the ſummer paſt, wantonly made ſuch havock in our land—plundered and deſtroyed ſo many of our villages, and caſt fire into ſo many of our cities?— that have reduced our metropolis to ſuch diſtreſs— have profaned the ſanctuaries of God, and treated his worſhippers with ſo much perfidy, barbarity and inſult? What anſwer ſhall I give to theſe queſtions?—When our fore-fathers took ſanctuary in theſe then inhoſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table ſhores, it was to ſecure to themſelves and their progeny "peace, liberty and ſafety." When they purchaſed lands of the natives, they thought them their own: and when they cultivated them for their children whom they hoped to leave free and happy, they little thought their poſterity would be diſturbed in their poſſeſſions by <hi>Britons,</hi> more than themſelves were by ſavage Indians. And at the concluſion of the laſt war, which ſeemed to put an end to our fears of any moleſtation from the Savages for time to come, who could have thought that the ſame nation that then aſſiſted us in conquering them, would ever have laid ſuch a plan, and taken ſo much pains to inſtigate thoſe Savages to renew their cruelties, to ravage our weſtern borders, to murder women and children, and if poſſible to deſolate the country? Who could have thought that <hi>Britons</hi> would practiſe what the unculti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vated tribes of Indians have refuſed to do: and that
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:014754_0027_0F94DAB27999D980"/>
they themſelves would diſtreſs and deſtroy our moſt populous towns on the ſea coaſt, when the Savages could not be prevailed on by flatteries or gifts to moleſt our back ſettlements? What have we done to merit ſuch treatment? What high-handed crimes have we been guilty of to awaken ſuch vengeance? Many crimes have we been guilty of againſt heaven; but none, adequate to ſuch puniſhment, againſt the nation that executes ſuch vengeance upon us. We think we have refuſed ſubmiſſion in no inſtance, but where ſubmiſſion would have been unworthy of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> and a crime in the deſcendants of ſuch anceſtors as ours. We think we have reſiſted no authority but ſuch as natural and conſtitutional right warrants us to reſiſt. We have never lifted up a hand but in our own deſence, to ward off the blow that was aimed at our heads, or to return the blow after it had bee<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> firſt given.—But I forbear.—We have appealed to Heaven for the juſtice of our cauſe; and <hi>GOD,</hi> the God of juſtice, <hi>ſitteth on the throne judging right.</hi> And it would be great ingratitude in us not to acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge the ſignal hand of providence in uniting, directing and ſucceeding us in ſo remarkable a manner the ſummer paſt—in diſappointing and reſtraining our enemies, and in ſome parts, viz. <hi>Ticonderoga, St. Johns, Chamblee,</hi> and <hi>Montreal,</hi> entirely ſubduing them. But let not him that putteth on the harneſs boaſt as he that putteth it off. Let us not truſt in our own bow, nor rely upon our own ſword to ſave us; but let us have our dependance on the <hi>right hand and on the arm</hi> of God, that he may <hi>have a favor unto us.</hi> He hath given the inhabitants of <hi>New England</hi> abundant reaſon to confide in his power and goodneſs; for many a time hath he made bare his arm for our

deliverance. <hi>Many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up, may Iſrael now ſay; many a time have they afflicted me from my youth up; yet have they not prevailed againſt me. The Lord is righteous, he hath cut aſunder the cords of the wicked.</hi> And we know that he who hath hitherto protected and bleſſed, is ſtill able to protect and bleſs; in him therefore let us truſt, and not in an arm of fleſh.—We have been carried through one year of diſtreſs and difficulty; and methinks the proſpect is rather brighter than darker. I own there are ſome things which ſtill look formidable and diſcouraging: the moſt formidable and diſcouraging is the little good effect which the providences of God, both merciful and corrective, have had upon us. The great ruler hath tried us with a variety of diſpenſations. He hath permitted a moſt unnatural, unbrotherly and diſtreſſing civil war to break out amongſt us, though he hath not ſuffered our enemies to triumph over us—he hath teſtified his anger againſt us in the unfavorable weather the laſt ſummer, when unuſual froſts, and a ſcorching drought, greatly diminiſhed the fruits of the earth in this and many neighboring towns: and almoſt all parts of the country have been viſited by ſickneſs and mortality, whereby multitudes of all ages, particularly children, were ſwept into the grave. Yet may not God addreſs us as he did his incorrigable people of old? <hi>I have withholden the rain from you—and given you cleanneſs of teeth—and want of bread—yet have ye not returned unto me, ſaith the Lord. I have ſent among you the peſtilence after the manner of Egypt; yet have ye not returned unto me, ſaith the Lord. I have overthrown ſome of you— and ye were as a brand plucked out of the burning—yet have ye not returned unto me, ſaith the

Lord.</hi> Amos iv. 6—11. We in this Town have been corrected by the ſword of the deſtroying angel, but with a gentler hand than many others. <hi>Sixteen</hi> in this pariſh have, in the courſe of the year paſt gone down to the congregation of the dead; all of which excepting <hi>two</hi> were infants and young children. But we have had almoſt two births to one death: ſo that God is ſtill <hi>increaſing us more and more.</hi> Let us all be concerned to improve wiſely every diſpenſation of divine providence whether joyous or grievous, whether perſonal, domeſtic or public. Through the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhing goodneſs of God we have been brought to the cloſe of another year. Let us look back upon the ſins of it, and repent—upon the mercies of it, and be unfeignedly thankful. And let us begin a new year with newneſs of heart and new obedience. And O that our land may ſtill be <hi>a land which the Lord our God careth for, and that the eyes of the Lord our God would always be upon it from the beginning of the year even unto the end of the year.</hi> O that the preſent generation would <hi>know the God of their fathers, and ſerve him with a perfect heart and a willing mind;</hi> remembering that <hi>if they ſeek him he will be found of them; but if they forſake him he will caſt them off forever!</hi> And O that the generation to come might know and conſider the wonderful diſpenſations of divine providence towards the church and people of God, <hi>that they might ſet their hope in God, and not forget the works of God, but keep his commandments!</hi>

The above deed is therefore inſerted not only as a curioſity in itſelf, and as a gratification to the inhabitants of <hi>Brookfield,</hi> but <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> evidence that the firſt ſettlers of this town were ſo for from ſeizing upon the poſſeſſions of the Aboriginals and crouding out the lawful owners that they purchaſed the lands for a valuable conſideration. This alſo is to be attended to, that the Indians had the whole country before them, and that they wanted lands only to raiſe a little Indian corn and for hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and therefore were for from ſetting ſo high a value on lands as we do now; and that wampumpeag was in high eſtimation among them, as gold and ſilver among the Europeans. And however ſome indivi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duals among the Natives may have been impoſed on and cheated by particular mercenary traders, yet ſufficient evidence may be produced that our fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fathers got not this land in poſſeſſion by fraud and injuſtice, but by fair purchaſe or lawful conqueſt.</p>
