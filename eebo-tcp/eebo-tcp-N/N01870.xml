            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HE general Name of <hi>New-England,</hi> includes in its common Acceptation the Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſets-Bay,</hi> the Colony of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> the Government of <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> with <hi>Providence</hi> Plantations, and the Province of <hi>New-Hampſhire.</hi> The Three former are Charter Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments: The laſt, <hi>viz. New-Hampſhire,</hi> never had any peculiar Privileges, but is under the immediate and abſolute Direction of the Crown. The <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> as it is the firſt of all the Colonies in Extent of Terri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory and Number of Inhabitants, was the firſt incorpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rated, having obtain'd their Charter from King <hi>Charles</hi> the Firſt, in the Fourth Year of his Reign. The Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of <hi>Connecticut</hi> receiv'd theirs from King <hi>Charles</hi> the
<pb n="2" facs="unknown:002216_0005_0FDACFA99202BBA8"/>
Second in 1662, and the Fourteenth Year of his Reign. The Government of <hi>Rhode-Iſland</hi> had theirs in the Year following. Theſe Charters agreed in all the main Points, confirming to the Patentees their Title to the Soil, and giving them ample Privileges for the well ordering and governing the reſpective Plantations: They had Power to make a Common Seal; to plead and be impleaded; to call General Aſſemblies; to make Laws, ſo as they were not repugnant to the Laws of <hi>England</hi>; to aſſeſs the Freemen; to conſtitute all Civil Officers; to array the Inhabitants in warlike Poſture, and uſe the Martial Law, when Occaſion re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quir'd. And it was provided further, That in caſe a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Doubts ſhould ariſe, the Charters ſhould have the moſt favourable Conſtruction for the Benefit of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Corporations.</p>
            <p>INVITED and encourag'd by theſe Advantages, a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable Number of Perſons diſſenting from the <hi>Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pline</hi> of the Eſtabliſh'd Church, tho' agreeing with it in <hi>Doctrine,</hi> remov'd into thoſe remote Regions, upon no other View than to enjoy the Liberty of their Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences without Hazard to themſelves, or Offence to others. Thus the Colonies went on increaſing and flouriſhing, in ſpite of all Difficulties, till the Year 1684, when the City of <hi>London</hi> loſt its Charter, and moſt of the other Corporations in <hi>England,</hi> influenced by Fear or Flattery, complimented King <hi>Charles</hi> with a Surrender of theirs. In this general Ruin of Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters at Home, it could not be expected that thoſe in <hi>America</hi> ſhould eſcape. It was then that a <hi>Quo War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranto</hi> was iſſu'd againſt the Governour and Company of the <hi>Maſſachuſets Bay,</hi> and ſoon after a Judgment was given againſt them in <hi>Weſtminſter-Hall.</hi> At the ſame Time Sir <hi>Edmund Androſs,</hi> then the King's Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of <hi>New-England,</hi> did by Order from Court repair to <hi>Hartford,</hi> the Capital of <hi>Connecticut,</hi> with arm'd At<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tendants, and forcibly ſeiz'd their Charter for the King. <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> finding there was no Remedy to
<pb n="3" facs="unknown:002216_0006_0FDACFAB12F83F38"/>
be had, made a Vertue of Neceſſity, and peaceably reſign'd theirs. But as ſoon as the News arriv'd of the happy Revolution in <hi>England,</hi> theſe Two laſt mention'd Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments re-aſſum'd their Charters, and put them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves under the old Form of Adminiſtration, in which they have continu'd ever ſince. The Government of the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> cautious of offending their Superiours at Home, and conſidering there was a Judgment againſt them in the Court of <hi>Chancery,</hi> tho' moſt unfairly and illegally obtain'd, did not think it adviſeable to make this Step; but ſent Agents to Court to ſupplicate, in a humble Manner the Reſtoration of their Charter. To what Miſmanagement, or other Cauſe it was owing, that they did not obtain it, and that this Loyal Cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poration was the only one either in <hi>Old</hi> or <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> that did not recover its loſt Liberty under our late Glorious Deliverer King <hi>William,</hi> 'tis now too late, and therefore to no Purpoſe, to enquire. A new Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was order'd, which the Province now has, and is not much more than the Shadow of the old One. For by theſe new Letters Patents, the Appointment of a Governour, Lieutenant-Governour, Secretary, and all the Officers of the Admiralty, is veſted in the Crown. The Power of the Militia is wholly in the Hands of His Majeſty's Governour, as Captain-General. All Judges, Juſtices, and Sheriffs, to whom the Execution of the Laws is intruſted, are nominated by the Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour, with the Advice of His Majeſty's Council. The Governour has a Negative upon the Choice of Council<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lors, which is both <hi>peremptory</hi> and <hi>unlimited:</hi> He is neither oblig'd to render a Reaſon, nor reſtrain'd to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Number. All Laws enacted by the General Aſſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly are to be ſent Home for the Royal Approbation or Diſallowance. There is, beſides, one very comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive Article inſerted in this Charter, that no Laws, Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dinances, Elections, or Acts of Government whatſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhall be of any Validity, without the Conſent of the King's Governour ſignify'd in Writing.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="4" facs="unknown:002216_0007_0FDACFAC91D6CD90"/>BY theſe Reſervations, the Prerogative of the Crown, and the Dependance of the Province thereon are in the moſt effectual Manner ſecur'd, if there had been any Danger before, as I hope in the Sequel of this Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, to demonſtrate there was not. And yet it hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pens unaccountably that this Charter of King <hi>William,</hi> ſo limited and reſtrained, is as obnoxious as either of the other which have their full and entire Force. Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly when about Six Years ſince a Bill was brought into the Houſe of Commons, and twice read, for regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating the Charter and Proprietary Governments, This was one among the reſt, and the firſt nam'd in the Bill. And tho' the Honourable Houſe thought fit, upon hear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Petitions preſented to them on that Occaſion, to drop their Proceedings, there is Reaſon to believe they may at another time reſume them. It is in this View, that I have put together my Thoughts on the Subject, which for Methods ſake I have diſpos'd under the following Heads:</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt,</hi> I ſhall endeavour to ſhow, that the Charter Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments have a good and undoubted Right to their reſpective Charters.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly,</hi> That they have not forfeited them by any Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>government or Male-Adminiſtration.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly,</hi> That if they had, it would not be the Intereſt of the Crown to accept the Forfeitures. And,</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly,</hi> I ſhall make ſome Obſervations upon the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Method of Proceeding againſt the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters by a Bill in Parliament.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>1ſt. Propoſition,</hi> That the Charter Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have a good and undoubted Right to their reſpective Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters.</note>As to the firſt Point there can be no Difficulty. The Charters were Granted by the Crown, and the King is acknowledg'd to be the Head and Fountain of all Corporations and Franchiſes. For tho' my Lord <hi>Coke</hi> takes notice, That a Body Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litick may be eſtabliſh'd by Preſcription, yet ſuch Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcription
<pb n="5" facs="unknown:002216_0008_0FDACFAE11FCD008"/>
is only valid upon a Preſumption that there was an Ancient Grant of the Crown, which by the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jury of Time was afterwards loſt. I need not inſiſt upon what no Body controverts; but it is material to obſerve, that the <hi>American</hi> Charters are of a higher Nature, and ſtand on a better Foot, than the Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions in <hi>England.</hi> For theſe latter were granted upon Improvements already made, and therefore were Acts or meer Grace and Favour in the Crown; whereas the former were given as Praemiums for Services to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form'd, and therefore are to be conſider'd as Grants upon a <hi>valuable Conſideration</hi>; which adds Weight and Strength to the Title.</p>
            <p>To increaſe the Nation's Commerce and enlarge her Dominions, muſt be allow'd a Work of no little Merit, if we conſider the Hardſhips to which the Adventurers were expoſed; or the Expence in making their Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments; or laſtly, the great Advantages thence accruing to the Crown and Nation. It would be an endleſs Task to recount all the Diſappointments, and Diſaſters that befel the firſt Planters in theſe Enterprizes. I ſhall therefore only ſay in General, that after many Dangers in their Voyages over the <hi>Atlantick,</hi> which was not ſuch an eaſy Navigation a Hundred Years ago as it is now, they arriv'd at an Inhoſpitable Shore and a waſte Wilderneſs, where there were few of the Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſaries, and not one Accommodation of Life; where the Climate was ſo extreme, the Summer Heats ſo ſcorching, and the Winters ſo long and ſo cold, that the Countrey ſeem'd ſcarcely habitable; and to ſum up their Misfortunes, they found themſelves inevitably engag'd in a War with the Natives. So that by Fatigue and Famine, by the Extremity of the Seaſons, and by a War with the Savages, the firſt Planters ſoon found their Graves, leaving the young Settlements to be per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected by their Survivors.</p>
            <p>To omit all this, I ſhall only be particular in the Expence, which was above 200,000 <hi>l.</hi> in ſetling the ſingle Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſets Bay.</hi> The Account

ſtands thus: The Freight of the Paſſengers coſt 95000 <hi>l.</hi> The Tranſportation of their firſt Stock of Cattle came to 12000 <hi>l.</hi> The Proviſions laid in for Subſiſtance, till by Tillage more could be rais'd, coſt 45000 <hi>l.</hi> The Materials for Building their firſt little Cottages came to 18000 <hi>l.</hi> Their Arms and Ammunition coſt 22000<hi>l.</hi> Theſe ſeveral Articles amount to 192000 <hi>l.</hi> not taking into the Account the very great Sums which were ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pended in Things of private Uſe, that People could not be without, who were going to poſſeſs an uninha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bited Land. I muſt add, that 192 Ships were employ'd in making this great Plantation, and Twelve Years were ſpent before it was brought to any tolerable Degree of Perfection.</p>
            <p>As great, however, as this Expence was, I believe it will appear that the Settlement of <hi>New-England</hi> was not more chargeable to the Adventurers, than it has bin in its Conſequence profitable to <hi>Great Britain.</hi> There is no ſort of <hi>Britiſh</hi> Manufacture, but what the Subjects there demand in a greater or leſs Proportion, as they have Ability to pay for it; every Thing for the Uſe, Convenience, Ornament, and (I ſay it with regret) for the Luxury and Pride of Life. Some of the oldeſt and moſt experienc'd Traders to thoſe Parts have by Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation made theſe Exports ariſe to the Value of 300000 <hi>l. per Annum.</hi> The Imports from thence are equally beneficial to the Kingdom. They brought home Bullion as long as they had any left; and now they are ſo exhauſted they can no longer ſend it directly, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinue to remit it by the Way of <hi>Stain, Portugal</hi> and the <hi>Streights</hi>; It is there they ſell their Fiſh, and the Produce of it comes hither in Gold and Silver, or Bills of Exchange, which is the ſame thing.</p>
            <p>OTHER and better Returns than Money it ſelf they make in Maſts, the faireſt and largeſt in the whole World, beſides Pitch, Tarr, Turpentine, Roſin, Plank, Knees for Ships, and other Species of Timber for various Uſes. Theſe, eſpecially Pitch and Tar, were formerly pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chas'd of the <hi>Swede</hi> with Crown Pieces at intollerable
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:002216_0010_0FDACFB1FAFE2C40"/>
Prices; but ſince the Encourgement given for their Importation from <hi>New-England,</hi> they have fallen to half the Value. It is to be farther conſider'd, that what we take of theſe Commodities from our own Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, is brought Home in our own Ships, and paid for with our Manufactures.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>New England</hi> alſo imports Logwood for the dying our Woollen Goods in Quantites ſufficient for our own Uſe, and a Surplus with which we furniſh <hi>Holland, Hambro',</hi> and other Markets in <hi>Europe.</hi> It is wholly owing to the Induſtry of the People of <hi>New-England,</hi> that this uſeful Commodity is reduc'd from 30 and 40<hi>l. per</hi> Ton, which we us'd to pay for it to the <hi>Spaniard,</hi> to 12 <hi>l. per</hi> Ton, which is the preſent Price, and out of this 12 <hi>l.</hi> there is 4 <hi>l.</hi> 5 <hi>s.</hi> 0 <hi>d.</hi> paid to the Crown for Cuſtom.</p>
            <p>OTHER Articles might be mention'd, as Whale-Oil and Finns, which are yearly imported from <hi>New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> in no contemptible Quantities. They are uſeful in ſeveral Manufactures; and if nor had from thence muſt have been purchas'd of the <hi>Dutch</hi> with ready Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney and at exceſſive Prices.</p>
            <p>'TIS true, <hi>New England,</hi> makes no Sugar, but it aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſts the Iſlands that do; without which Aſſiſtance they could not make it, at leaſt not cheap enough, and in ſufficient Quantities to anſwer the Markets in <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rope.</hi> For if the Sugar Iſlands were oblig'd to ſow Wheat, and plant as much <hi>Indian</hi> Corn as they wanted, they muſt needs plant the fewer Canes, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence make the leſs Sugar. From thence they are alſo ſupply'd with Horſes for their Mills, Timber for their Sugar Works, Staves for their Cask, and what is more conſiderable, with Barrel Pork, Mackrel, and refuſe Cod-Fiſh for their Negroes, without which their Labour would yield nothing to their Owners. For were they to feed their Slaves with Beef and other Proviſions from <hi>Britain</hi> and <hi>Ireland,</hi> the Expence of a Plantation would devour the whole Produce of it. There are now ſuch great Quantities of Sugar made in
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:002216_0011_0FDACFB354783818"/>
the <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Dutch</hi> Plantations, and ſo much import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from <hi>Braſil</hi> by the <hi>Portugueſe,</hi> that our Sugar Iſlands need all Advantages to make this Commodity cheap and in Plenty, that we may be able to out-do, or at leaſt equal our Neighbours in the foreign Markets.</p>
            <p>IT may be added, that <hi>New-England</hi> is a good Nurſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of Seamen for the Navy. I believe I may affirm, that there was hardly a Ship, during the laſt War, in the Royal Navy without ſome of <hi>their</hi> Sailors on Board, which ſo diſtreſs'd the <hi>New England</hi> Merchants, that they were oblig'd to man their Ships with <hi>Indians</hi> and Negroes.</p>
            <p>WHAT I have ſaid amounts to this: THAT <hi>New-England</hi> receiv'd her Charters on this expreſs Conditi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, of ſettling Colonies for the Benefit of the Crown:</p>
            <p>THAT ſhe was at a vaſt Expence, and through in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>credible Difficulties accompliſh'd the Work even be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond what was ever hop'd or expected.</p>
            <p>AND then the Concluſion, that I would draw from theſe Ptemiſes is this, THAT to ſtrip the Country of their Charters after the Service has been ſo ſucceſsful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly perform'd, is abhorrent from all Reaſon, Equity and Juſtice.</p>
            <p>BUT it is urg'd, <hi>That the Crown does not take back the Soil, though it does the Charters</hi>; which indeed is ſaying very little or nothing The Crown, ſtrictly ſpeaking, neither did nor could grant the Soil, having no Right in it ſelf. Queen <hi>Eliſabeth</hi> gave out the firſt Patent to Sir <hi>Walter Rawleigh</hi> in 1584; and if ſhe had any Right, what was it and whence deriv'd? It was not a <hi>Right of Inheritance,</hi> becauſe thoſe Countries did not deſcend to her from her Anceſtors. Not of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest,</hi> becauſe ſhe neither conquer'd, nor attempted to conquer them. Beſides, it would be pretty hard to conceive how a Conqueſt, where there was no preceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Injury or Provocation, could create a Right. Nor did it ariſe by <hi>Purchaſe,</hi> there being no Money or other valuable Conſideration paid. Nor could ſhe claim by
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:002216_0012_0FDACFB4D1DA86B0"/>
the <hi>prior Diſcovery or Pre-occupancy,</hi> as the Civilians ſpeak, becauſe that gives a Right only to <hi>derelict Lands,</hi> which theſe were not, being full of Inhabitants, who undoubtedly had as good a Title to their own Country, as the <hi>Europeans</hi> have to theirs. And ſure no Body will ſay in plain Terms, that we have any Claim upon the Foot that we were <hi>Christians,</hi> and they <hi>Heathen</hi>; which yet I know ſome Perſons of no obſcure Fame have tacitly ſuggeſted. <hi>Rome</hi> it ſelf, as imperious as ſhe is, never carry'd her Pretences to this Height: For though ſome of her Doctors have taught, abſurdly enough<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that <hi>Dominion</hi> is founded in Grace, none of 'em ever ſaid that <hi>Property</hi> was. There remains then no other Right than what is deriv'd from the native Lords of the Soil, and that is what the honeſt <hi>New-England</hi> Planters rely on, having purchas'd it with their Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney. The <hi>Indian Title</hi> therefore, as it is decry'd and undervalu'd here, ſeems the only fair and juſt one; and neither Queen <hi>Eliſabeth</hi> by <hi>her</hi> Patents, or King <hi>James</hi> by <hi>his</hi> afterwards, could give any more than a bare <hi>Right of Preemption.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>AND yet admitting that the Crown granted the Soil, to how little muſt the Value of ſuch Grants amount, all Circumſtances conſider'd? The Patentees were not only oblig'd to travel a Thouſand Leagues beyond Sea, but to purchaſe the Grants over again of the Natives, before they could be put into Poſſeſſion. The Land it ſelf was of a rough ſavage Nature, incumber'd with unprofitable Woods, and of no Uſe till by vaſt Labour and Expence ſubdu'd and cultivated. For to ſpeak the Truth, thoſe Parts were but <hi>bare Creation</hi> to the firſt Planters, and their Labour <hi>like the Beginning the World.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>So that which Way ſoever we take it, I think it's plain, if the Crown reſumes the Charters, it will take away the Whole it gave, and deprive the Patentees of the only Recompence they were to have for all their Toils and Fatigues, which they thought to have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyed ſafe to their Poſterity. Could they have ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin'd this, could they have foreſeen that their Privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:002216_0013_0FDACFB651F51778"/>
were ſuch <hi>tranſitory things,</hi> as to laſt no longer than their Work ſhould be done, and their ſettlements compleated, they had never engag'd in ſo hazardous and difficult an Enterprize. They would never have parted from their Native Land being neither Crimi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nals nor Neceſſitous; and thoſe Countries which have ſince added ſo much to the Wealth and Greatneſs of the Crown, might have been a barren Wilderneſs to this Day; or what is worſe, and more probable, might have bin fill'd with <hi>French</hi> Colonies, whereby <hi>France</hi> would have reign'd ſole Miſtreſs of <hi>North America.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I believe it will be generally allow'd, that my Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gument is thus far right, if I can make good my ſecond Propoſition, <hi>VIZ.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">
                  <hi>2d Propoſition.</hi> That theſe Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments have by no Misbehaviour for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited their Charters.</note>THAT theſe Governments have by no Misbehaviour forfeited back their Charters to the Crown.</p>
            <p>SOME of the ableſt Common Lawyers that <hi>England</hi> could ever boaſt of, have maintain'd that a Corporation, being an <hi>Ens Rationis,</hi> is in it's Nature indiſſolvable, and that therefore no Abuſe of it's Franchiſes can effect it in point of Forfeiture, or determine its Being. If this Argument ſhould be thought too ſubtle and meta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phyſical, I hope however it will be allow'd an Extreme on the other ſide, that a Corporation ſhould be threaten'd for <hi>every</hi> Offence to be ſeiz'd into the King's Hands. The Subjects Abroad claim the Privilege of <hi>Magna Charta,</hi> which ſays that no Man ſhall be fin'd above the Nature of his Offence, and whatever his Miſcarriage be, a <hi>Salvo Contenemento ſuo</hi> is to be obſerv'd by the Judge. If therefore they have committed Faults, let them be <hi>chaſtiz'd,</hi> not <hi>deſtroy'd,</hi> let not their Corpora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions be diſſolv'd for any other Crime than a Failure of their Allegiance. But I need not go into this or any other nice Point of Law, it being ſufficient to ſhow that the Charter Governments are clear of the ſeveral Facts
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:002216_0014_0FDACFB7D5F49718"/>
which have been objected againſt them, and aſſign'd as matter of Forfeiture. In the Bill that was brought into the Houſe of Commons, there were two Allegations againſt the Charter and Proprietary Governments, which I ſhall firſt anſwer, and then go on to conſider ſuch other Complaints as I have met with from Time to Time againſt theſe Governments.</p>
            <p>THE firſt Charge in the Bill againſt the Charter Governments is,<note place="margin">The <hi>1</hi>ſt Charge againſt the Charter Governments, that they have neglect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Defence of the Inhabitants, <hi>anſwered.</hi>
               </note> that <hi>they have neglected the Defence of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants.</hi> This I muſt own, if true, and ſuch Neglect was voluntary, while they had the Means and Power of De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence in their Hands, was a high and treaſonable Breach of their Truſt and would be the ſtrongeſt Argument that could be brought for a Reſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the Charters. But now, if I ſhall prove that theſe Governments, eſpecially the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> and <hi>Connecticut,</hi> have in all paſt Times defended the Inha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitants both by Sea and Land, as well againſt the <hi>French</hi> as <hi>Indian</hi> Enemy: If I ſhall prove that they have all the late War protected one of the <hi>King's Provinces</hi> lying on their Confines, which would otherwiſe inevitably have bin loſt; and that <hi>another</hi> of theſe Provinces took no Part in the War, but maintain'd a ſhameful Neu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trality with the Enemy, whereby the whole Weight of the War fell on the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi>; If I ſhall prove that they have frequently carry'd offenſive Arms into the <hi>French</hi> Territories, and made one important Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt, ſince annex'd to the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Crown; and that all this was done at their own vaſt Expence; then, I hope, <hi>New-England</hi> will ſtand fairly acquitted of this ſuppos'd Crime of <hi>Neglecting to defend the Inhabitants,</hi> and be al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd not only irreprehenſible in this reſpect, but to have highly merited of the Crown and Nation.</p>
            <p>THESE FACTS are ſo certain and ſo well known, that I'm perſwaded this had never bin aſſign'd as a Reaſon for diſſolving the Charters<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> but with a ſpecial View to <hi>Carolina,</hi> which, when this Bill was brought into the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:002216_0015_0FDACFB9550BB9D0"/>
Houſe, was reduc'd to extremity by a War with the <hi>Spaniſh Indians</hi>; and being neither able to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, nor obtain Succours from their Lords Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, addreſs'd the Crown to take them under its Protection. It was therefore natural enough to mention this in the Bill; though with humble Submiſſion, it being the ſingle Caſe of one Proprietary Colony, it ſhould in all Reaſon have bin reſtrain'd to that, and not extended to the Charter Provinces, which are neither alike conſtituted, nor were in the ſame Diſtreſs. For <hi>New-England,</hi> as I ſhall preſently ſhow, has defended it ſelf from the firſt Beginning to this Day without being burdenſome to the Crown, though not without great Struggles and Difficulties.</p>
            <p>'TIS TRUE, they did not commence Hoſtilities, nor even take up Arms of Defence, till they found by Experience that no other Means would prevail. The firſt Planters, far from uſing the barbarous Methods practis'd by the <hi>Spaniards</hi> on the <hi>Southern</hi> Continent, which have made them deteſtable to the whole Chriſtian World, ſought to gain the Natives by ſtrict Juſtice in their Dealings with them, as well as by all the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dearments of Kindneſs and Humanity. To lay an ear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Foundation for a firm and laſting Friendſhip, they aſſur'd the <hi>Americans,</hi> that they did not come among them as Invaders but Purchaſers, and therefore call'd an Aſſembly of them together, to enquire who had the Right to diſpoſe of their Lands; and being told it was their <hi>Sachems</hi> or Princes, they thereupon agreed with them for what Diſtricts they bought, publickly and in open Market. If they did not pay a great Price for their Purchaſes yet they paid as much as they were worth. For it muſt be conſider'd, that Land was of little Uſe to the Natives, and therefore but of little Value. They liv'd chiefly on Fiſh and Fowl, and Hunt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, becauſe they would not be at the Pains to clear and break up the Ground. And as for their Meadows and Marſhes, they were of no Uſe at all, for want of neat Cattle to feed them, of which there were none in thoſe Parts of the World.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:002216_0016_0FDACFBB27237478"/>THE <hi>Engliſh</hi> had no ſooner made ſome neceſſary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſion for themſelves, than they apply'd their Cares for the Benefit of the <hi>Indians,</hi> by endeavouring to bring them from their wild manner of Life to the civil and polite Cuſtoms of <hi>Europe.</hi> For this purpoſe, they mark'd out Land to build <hi>Indian</hi> Towns, ſupply'd them with all proper Utenſils for Building, preſcrib'd to them forms of Government, and above all, omitted no Pains to bring them acquainted with the Goſpel. After ſome Time, when it was found neceſſary, the Colony made a Law to forbid any Perſon's purchaſing Land of the <hi>Indians</hi> without the Approbation of the General Court, to prevent their being over-reach'd or ill us'd in their private Bargains: and ſome Land, ly<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing very convenient for them, was by another law made inalienable, and never to be purchaſed out of their Hands, than which nothing could more demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrate the Colony's Care and Concern for the Natives.</p>
            <p>I THOUGHT my ſelf oblig'd to make this Preface to the main Argument, that I might wipe off an unworthy Aſperſion that has been caſt on the firſt Setlers of <hi>New-England,</hi> that they never treated the Savages well, but en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>croach'd on their Land by Degrees, till they fraudulently and forcibly turn'd them out of all. It was far otherwiſe, as I have ſhown; yet nothing could oblige the <hi>Indians</hi> to Peace and Friendſhip. They were alarm'd with the ſtrong Jealouſies of the growing Power of the <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and therefore began a War with a Reſolution to extirpate them, before they had too well eſtabliſh'd themſelves. Yet as terrible as this Proſpect was to Two or Three young Colonies, who had work enough to defend them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves againſt Famine, which in a cold barren Country ſurrounded with Enemies ſtar'd them in the Face, they nevertheleſs made no Application to the Crown for Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtance, but drew up Articles of Confederacy among themſelves, by the Name of the <hi>United Colonies of</hi> New-England, for their mutual Defence. This done, they took the Number of all the Males in the ſeveral Plantations, and raiſing a Poll Tax according to each
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:002216_0017_0FDACFBC51B81648"/>
Perſon's reſpective Ability, they with one Conſent laid aſide their Ploughſhares and Pruning Hooks for the Sword and the Spear, and under the Command of Major-Generals, whom they choſe after the manner then in <hi>England,</hi> march'd directly to the Enemy's Head-Quarters, and ſtrongeſt Fortifications, from whence they drove them with great Precipitation. Nor did they ſtop there, but purſu'd them through all their Receſſes, 'till they oblig'd them to enter into a ſolemn Treaty of Peace. Such however was the perfidious Nature of the <hi>American</hi> Savages, that they ſoon renew'd the Hoſtilities, tho' to their own fatal Coſt. For if the <hi>Engliſh</hi> experienc'd a Variety of Fortune, as could not but be expected in the Viciſſitudes of War, yet they were for the moſt part victorious, and in the Courſe of ſome Years, after many terrible Slaughters of the Enemy, ſubdu'd and utterly extirpated Seven or Eight fierce and populous Nations.</p>
            <p>I AM ſenſible ſome have endeavour'd to depreciate theſe Conqueſts, as gain'd over a rude barbarous people unexercis'd to Arms; which if granted, ſtill it can't be ſaid, that <hi>the Defence of the Inhabitants was neglected</hi>; and therefore the Charter Governments can fall under no Cenſure, if they ſhould be thought to have merited no Praiſe. But if it be conſider'd, that the <hi>New-England</hi> Forces contended with Enemies bloody in their Nature and ſuperiour in Number; that they attack'd them in deep Moraſſes, defended with Fortifications ſufficiently ſtrong, tho' not regular; and that the Aſſai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lants were not provided with Canon, nor could approach by Trenches, but advanc'd on level Ground: And if to this be added the vaſt Fatigues of their Campaigns, where Officers and Soldiers lay on the Snow without any Shelter over their Heads in the moſt rigorous Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters; I ſay, if a juſt Conſideration be had of theſe Things, Envy it ſelf muſt acknowledge that their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes were hardy, and their Succeſſes glorious. And tho' the brave Commanders who led on theſe Troops, and moſt of them died in the Bed of Honour, muſt not
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:002216_0018_0FDACFBDD2E34BF0"/>
ſhine in the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Annals, yet their Memory ought to be ſacred in their own Country, and there at leaſt be tranſmitted to the lateſt Poſterity.</p>
            <p>THE inland Parts being now at reſt, the War was remov'd to the Frontiers, which were cruelly harraſs'd by other <hi>Indian Tribes,</hi> animated and aſſiſted by the <hi>French</hi> of <hi>Canada,</hi> who have given the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi> but few Intervals of Peace, and thoſe very ſhort ones from that Time to this Day. All this while THAT Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment was never wanting to protect the King's Subjects within their Juriſdiction, even in the remoteſt Parts of it. They kept Troops on foot, no leſs than Six or Seven Hundred at a Time, to cover the Barrier Line, and built Forts wherever they were neceſſary; one of them nam'd <hi>William-Henry,</hi> but commonly call'd <hi>Pemaquid</hi> Fort, becauſe built on a River of that Name, was in the Heart of the Enemy's Country, and deſerves a particular Deſcription. It was built of Stone in a quadrangular Figure, 737 Foot in Circumference, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the outer Wall, and 108 Foot ſquare within the inner ones. It had 28 Ports, and 18 Guns mounted, 6 being 18 Pounders. The Wall on the South Line fronting to the Sea was 22 Foot high, and above 6 Foot thick at the Ports, which were 8 Foot from the Ground. The round Tower at the Weſt End of this Line, was 29 Foot high: The Wall on the Eaſt Line was 12 Foot high, on the North 10, and on the Weſt 18. It ſtood 20 Rod from High-Water Mark, and was garriſon'd with 60 and ſometimes 100 Men. The Expence in building and maintaining this Garriſon was conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, yet the Province chearfully ſubmitted to it; nor did they decline rebuilding it, after it was ſurpriz'd and demoliſh'd by the <hi>French,</hi> for any other reaſon, but that it was found by Experience, the Enemy could come many Miles wide of it, and attack their Frontiers. They therefore built Forts at <hi>Saco</hi> and <hi>Caſco,</hi> and other Places moſt expos'd which anſwer'd the ſame End.</p>
            <p>BY this Care the Power of the Enemy was very much broke, and the King's Province of <hi>New-Hampſhire</hi>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:002216_0019_0FDACFBF60746150"/>
from whence the Royal Navy is annually ſupply'd with Maſts, has been preſerv'd, which otherwiſe muſt have unavoidably been loſt, being unable to help it ſelf, and receiving no Succours from Home. <hi>New-York,</hi> a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother of the King's Provinces, has always kept it ſelf in a State of Neutrality, contributing nothing to the common Safety, whilſt the <hi>Canada Indians,</hi> join'd by Parties of the <hi>French,</hi> us'd to make their <hi>Route</hi> by their Borders without moleſting them, and fall upon the Out Towns of the <hi>Maſſachuſets.</hi> This Behaviour was the more unpardonable in that Government, becauſe they have 400 regular Troops maintain'd among them at the King's Charge, and have the five Nations of the <hi>Iroquoiſe</hi> on their Confines, who are entirely depen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent on them, and might eaſily, had they bin engag'd in the common Cauſe, at all Times have intercepted the Enemy in their Marches, and thereby have preven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Depredations committed on his Majeſty's Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects. Solemn and repeated Applications were made to the Government of <hi>New-York,</hi> by the Governours of the <hi>Maſſachuſets, Connecticut,</hi> and <hi>Rhode-Iſland,</hi> in joint Letters on this Subject, but in vain. The Anſwer was they could not think it proper to engage their <hi>Indians</hi> in an actual War, leſt they ſhould endanger their own Frontiers, and bring upon themſelves an Expence which they were in no Condition to provide for. And thus the poor Charter Colonies were left to bear the whole Burden, and do all the Work themſelves.</p>
            <p>THE Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſets Bay</hi> has been equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſollicitous to protect their Inhabitants by Sea, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt any Foreign Invaſion. For this End they have kept their Militia well train'd and diſciplin'd and by an Act of the Aſſembly oblig'd all Perſons, under pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per Penalties, to be well provided with Ammunition and Arms, that they might be ready in caſe of a ſud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den Deſcent from Abroad. <hi>Boſton,</hi> which is their Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital Town, and principal Sea-port, is fortify'd with Two Batteries to the Sea, one at each End of the Town; and about a League from it, at the Entrance of the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:002216_0020_0FDAC8E0B3FF4780"/>
Harbour, there is a ſtrong beautiful Caſtle, which is by far the fineſt Piece of military Architecture in the <hi>Britiſh America.</hi> It was built by Colonel <hi>Romer,</hi> a famous <hi>German</hi> Engineer, at the Countries Expence, and is call'd <hi>Caſtle William.</hi> It is a <hi>Quarre</hi> ſurrounded with a cover'd Way, and join'd with two Lines of Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nication from the main Battery, as alſo a Line of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munication from the main Gate to a Redoubt, which is to prevent the Landing. It is well ſituated near the Channel, to hinder Ships from coming up to the Town, which muſt all come within Piſtol ſhot of this Battery. It is mounted with 100 Pieces of Cannon, ſeveral of which are plac'd on a Platform, near High-water Mark, ſo as to rake a Ship fore and aft, before ſhe can bring her Broadſides to bear againſt the Caſtle, and ſome of theſe Cannon carry 42 Pounders. In Peace there is an independent Company of 50 or 100 Men, I'm not cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain which, that conſtantly are on Duty; but in time of War 500 able Men are exempted from all other military Duty, to attend the Service of the Caſtle at an Hours Warning, upon any Signal given of the Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of an Enemy. To prevent the Caſtle's being ſurpriz'd, there's a Light-Houſe built on a Rock appear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing above Water two Leagues from the Town, which makes a Signal to the Caſtle of the Appearance of any Ships and their Number. The Caſtle again warns the Town, and if there be 5 Ships or more in time of War, an Alarm is given to all the adjacent Countries by firing a Beacon. The Province has alſo a Galley or Frigate well man'd in time of War, to guard the Coaſt from Privateers, and to convoy their Home Trade. In ſhort, nothing that could be done for Defence of the Subject by Sea or Land, has bin left undone. It is really aſto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſhing to conſider, and difficult to believe, that theſe little Governments ſhould be able by their own Strength, and at their own Charge, to perform ſuch great Things.</p>
            <p>AND YET this is not all that muſt be ſaid in their Defence. For as I have before obſerv'd, they have
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:002216_0021_0FDACFC252D95910"/>
diſcover'd a noble Zeal to enlarge the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire, by undertaking ſeveral chargeable Expeditions againſt the ſtrongeſt <hi>French</hi> Settlements in <hi>America.</hi> In the Year 1690 they made an Armament againſt <hi>Fort Royal,</hi> which was a Neſt of Privateers, and a <hi>Dunkirk</hi> to the <hi>American</hi> Trade; beſides that it was the Head Quarter, from whence Parties of <hi>French</hi> and <hi>Indians</hi> iſſued out, and fell upon the Eaſtern Parts of <hi>New-England.</hi> They made themſelves Maſters of the Place with all the Country of <hi>Accadie,</hi> and Sir <hi>William Phipps</hi> who com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded in chief, adminiſter'd to the Inhabitants an Oath of Allegiance to the Crown of <hi>England</hi>; in which State that Country remain'd till the Peace of <hi>Ryſwick</hi>
               <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> when it was deliver'd up to the <hi>French.</hi> The great Service done the Crown by this Acquiſition, is now too well known to need being particularly mention'd.</p>
            <p>THE <hi>New-Englanders</hi> being willing to purſue this good Succeſs, made an Attempt againſt <hi>Canada</hi> the ſame Year, with a Fleet of 32 Sail of Veſſels, beſides Ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, having on Board 2000 Men, whilſt at the ſame time a little Army of 1000 <hi>Engliſh</hi> and 1500 <hi>Indians</hi> were to march by Land and attack <hi>Mont-Real.</hi> 'Tis true, they fatally miſcarry'd, (and who can anſwer for the Fortune of War?) But this ought not to leſſen the Merit of an Enterprize, which they ſo well intended, and by which they ſo greatly ſuffer'd. It coſt 150,000 <hi>l.</hi> in Money, and what was infinitely more valuable, the Lives of 1000 Men. Nor were theſe Vagrants, ſuch as are pickt up here in the Streets, and diſorderly Houſes, and thence preſs'd into the War, but Heads of Families, Artificers, and robuſt young Men, ſuch as no Country can ſpare, and leaſt of all New Settlements, where Labour is the deareſt Thing in the World, becauſe no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing ſo much wanted as Hands. They did not indeed fall by the Sword of the Enemy, if that could alle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viate their Misfortune, but by a Camp Fever, by Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mine, and various Diſaſters in their return Home, oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion'd chiefly by the early Approach of a ſevere Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter which made it impracticable for Proviſions to fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="19" facs="unknown:002216_0022_0FDACFC3D40415A0"/>GREAT was the diſtreſs to which theſe poor Colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies were reduc'd by this expenſive and improſperous Expedition; yet by the wiſe Conduct of the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, and the Induſtry of the People, they ſo well recover'd themſelves in leſs than 20 Years, as to reſolve upon making another Viſit to their <hi>French</hi> Neighbours, whom they ſaw daily growing in Power, and threat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning in time to deſtroy all the <hi>Engliſh</hi> Settlements. But not thinking themſelves ſtrong enough to deal with <hi>Quebeck,</hi> they were content to make only an Attempt on <hi>Port Royal,</hi> which was done accordingly, tho' not with the former Succeſs, the <hi>French</hi> Fort being now ſtrong and regular, and well provided for a Defence or Siege.</p>
            <p>NOT diſcourag'd by this Repetition of Misfortunes, when the late Queen ſignify'd to theſe Governments, her Royal Intention to reduce <hi>Canada,</hi> and requir'd them to provide their Quota of Troops; it can't be imagin'd with what Alacrity they came into it, and made in all Reſpects ample Proviſion for it. And tho' the Court altering their Meaſures did not ſee meet at that time to proceed in the Deſign, yet the Colonies were put to near the ſame Charge as if they had.</p>
            <p>THE next Year they rais'd a Body of Troops again, which commanded by Colonel <hi>Nicholſon,</hi> with 500 Auxiliaries from hence, made another Deſcent upon <hi>Port Royal</hi> and reduc'd it. For which Service they were promis'd by her then Majeſty conſiderable Advan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tages in reſpect of Trade and the Fiſhery, to which it's hop'd a juſt regard will be had, when <hi>Nova Scotia</hi> is brought under a Civil Eſtabliſhment.</p>
            <p>ONE may imagine now that theſe Colonies were quite out of Breath, and needed a little Reſt. Yet preſently after, when the great unfortunate Expedition was ſet on Foot againſt <hi>Canada</hi> under the Command of General <hi>Hill</hi> and Admiral <hi>Walker,</hi> they furniſh'd more than the Quota aſſign'd 'em, and provided all Neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries for the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Troops in ſo ſhort a Time, that if they had not been animated by an extraordinary Zeal,
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:002216_0023_0FDACFC5AA9E9948"/>
would not have been poſſible. And notwithſtanding ſome People found it neceſſary to blame <hi>New England,</hi> the better to excuſe themſelves, yet it has been ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledg'd to me by <hi>Engliſh</hi> Gentlemen, who were then on the good, and well experienc'd in theſe Affairs; that ſuch a Fleet and Army wanting the Neceſſaries they did, could not have been diſpatch'd on ſo ſhort Warning from any Port in <hi>England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>MY Anſwer to this Article of Accuſation would be imperfect, if I did not ſtill further obſerve, that theſe Governments have aſſiſted and reliev'd the moſt diſtant of His Majeſty's Iſlands, and the remoteſt Settlements on the Continent, when in Diſtreſs, upon no other In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement, than that of being their Fellow Subjects. I'll give Two or Three Examples.</p>
            <p>WHEN in the Year 1703, or about that Time, <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica</hi> was in Fear of an Invaſion, and deſir'd ſome Help from the Government of the <hi>Maſſachuſets</hi>; They, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding the length of the Voyage, which is often 8 or 9 Weeks, ſent them two Companies of Foot, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded by Colonel <hi>Walton,</hi> and Captain <hi>Larimore,</hi> both very gallant Officers. The Companies arriv'd ſafe, and ſerv'd there two Years, ſometimes on Shore, and at other Times as Marines on Board the Man of War, then in the Service of the Iſland; and I believe very few of theſe Soldiers ever returned to their Native Country.</p>
            <p>IN 1705, when <hi>Nevis</hi> was plunder'd and ruin'd by <hi>Ibberville, New-England</hi> charitably, and of their own accord rais'd 2000<hi>l.</hi> for their Relief; which they ſent in two Veſſels, each having 1000<hi>l.</hi> on Board in Flower and Salt Proviſions for their Subſiſtance, and in Materi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>als for Rebuilding their Houſes and Mills. This they did generouſly, neither deſiring nor receiving any Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns, when that Iſland came into more proſperous Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances.</p>
            <p>AND now lately, when <hi>Carolina</hi> was ingag'd in a War with the <hi>Spaniſh Indians</hi> and wanted Arms and Ammunition, they were ſupply'd with both from <hi>Boſton.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="21" facs="unknown:002216_0024_0FDACFC6D1E8D2D8"/>UPON the whole, what a vaſt Fund of Merit have the Charter Governments rais'd to themſelves from a long Series of Faithful and Heroick Services! And how ſtrangely out of Countenance muſt this Objection look, <hi>that they have neglected the Defence of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants</hi>! I have only to wiſh, that His Majeſty and His Miniſtry had leiſure from the important Affairs of the Nation, and of <hi>Europe,</hi> to conſider their Merit, and then I aſſure my ſelf, inſtead of depriving them of their preſent Privileges, they would continue them forever; and, if there were room for it, add as many more.</p>
            <p>THE other Charge in the Bill is,<note place="margin">The <hi>2</hi>d Charge in the Bill againſt the Charter Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, that they have exercis'd arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary Power, <hi>anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer'd.</hi>
               </note>
               <hi>That they have exercis'd arbitrary Power.</hi> If this be aim'd at the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prietary Governments, which how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever I don't accuſe, I have nothing to ſay, but am ſure that the Charter Governments ſtand clear of it. The Thing ſpeaks loudly for it ſelf. For in the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, where there are Charters, and thoſe Charters entire, all Officers Civil and Military are elected by the People, and that anually; than which Conſtitution nothing under Heaven can be a ſtronger Barrier againſt arbitrary Rule. For ſhould it be allow'd, that the Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>corrupted</hi> or <hi>deceiv'd,</hi> might inſtead of wiſe Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giſtrates chuſe Tyrants and Oppreſſors to Lord over them one Year; yet it can't be imagin'd, that after they have felt the Smart of it, they will do ſo the next. Nor can there be a greater Obligation on the Rulers themſelves to adminiſter Juſtice than that their Election depends on it the next Year. Hence the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Choice of Magiſtrates has bin ever a main Pillar; upon which all who have aim'd at Freedom in their Schemes of Government, have depended.</p>
            <p>As the Reaſon is inconteſtible, ſo the Fact is appa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rent, that theſe Governments, far from retrenching the Liberty of the Subject, have improv'd it in ſome important Articles, which the Circumſtances of Things in <hi>Great Britain</hi> perhaps don't require, or won't eaſily admit:</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:002216_0025_0FDACFC852DD1230"/>To inſtance in a few; There has bin from the begin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning an Office erected by Law in every Country, where all Conveyances of Land are enter'd at large, after the Grantors have firſt acknowledg'd them before a Juſtice of Peace; by which means much Fraud is prevented, no Perſon, being able to ſell his Eſtate twice, or take up more Money upon it than it's worth. Proviſion has likewiſe been made for the Security of the Life and Property of the Subject in the Matter of Juries, who are not return'd by the Sherriff of the County, but are choſen by the Inhabitants of the Town a convenient Time before the ſitting of the Courts. And this Election is under the moſt exact Regulation, in Order to prevent Corruption, ſo far as Humane Prudence can do it. It muſt be noted, that Sherriffs in the Plantations are com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paratively but little Officers, and therefore not to be truſted as here, where they are Men of ample Fortunes. And yet even here ſuch flagrant Corruptions have been found in returning Juries by Sherriffs, that the Houſe of Commons thought it neceſſary in their laſt Seſſion to amend the Law in this Point, and paſs'd a Bill for chooſing them by Ballot.</p>
            <p>REDRESS in their Courts of Law is <hi>eaſy, quick</hi> and <hi>cheap.</hi> All Proceſſes are in <hi>Engliſh,</hi> and no ſpecial Pleadings or Demurrers are admitted, but the general Iſſue is always given, and ſpecial Matters brought in Evidence; which ſaves Time and Expence; and in this Caſe a Man is not liable to loſe his Eſtate for a Defect in Form, nor is the Merit of the Cauſe made to depend on the Niceties of Clerkſhip. By a Law of the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try no Writ may be abated for a circumſtantial Error, ſuch as a ſlight Miſ-nomer or any Informality. And by another Law, it is enacted, that every Attorney taking out a Writ from the Clerk's Office, ſhall indorſe his Sirname upon it, and be liable to pay to the adverſe Party his Coſts and Charges in Caſe of Non-Proſecution or Diſcontinuance, or that the Plaintiff be Non-ſuit, or Judgment paſs againſt him. And it is provided in the ſame Act, That if the Plaintiff ſhall ſuffer a Nonſuit
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:002216_0026_0FDACFC9D57583D8"/>
by the Attorney's miſ-laying the Action, he ſhall be oblig'd to draw a new Writ without a Fee, in caſe the Party ſhall ſee fit to revive the Suit. I can't but think that every body, except Gentlemen of the long Robe and the Attornies, will think this a wholeſome Law, and well calculated for the Benefit of the Subject. For the quicker Diſpatch of Cauſes, Declarations are made Parts of the Writ, in which the Caſe is fully and par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticularly ſet forth. If it be matter of Account, the Account is annex'd to the Writ, and Copies of both left with the Defendant; which being done Fourteen Days before the Sitting of the Court, he is oblig'd to plead directly, and the Iſſue is then try'd. Whereas by the Practice of the Court of <hi>King's-Bench,</hi> Three or Four Months Time is often loſt after the Writ is ſerv'd, before the Cauſe can be brought to Iſſue.</p>
            <p>NOR are the People of <hi>New-England</hi> oppreſs'd with the infinite Delays and Expence that attend the Proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in <hi>Chancery,</hi> where both Parties are often ruin'd by the Charge and Length of the Suit. But as in all other Countries, <hi>England,</hi> only excepted, <hi>Jus &amp; Aequum</hi> are held the ſame, and never divided; ſo it is there: A Power of <hi>Chancery</hi> being veſted in the Judges of the Courts of Common Law as to ſome particular Caſes, and they make equitable Conſtructions in Others. I muſt add, that the Fees of Officers of all ſorts are ſetled by Acts of Aſſembly at moderate Prices, for the Eaſe of the Subject.</p>
            <p>IT were eaſy to mention other Articles, but that I perſwade my ſelf it is needleſs. The Charter Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments are celebrated for their excellent Laws and mild Adminiſtration; for the Security of Liberty and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perty; for the Encouragement of Vertue, and Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of Vice; for the promoting Letters, by erecting Free-Schools and Colleges; and in one Word, for every Thing that can make a People happy and proſperous, To theſe Arts it is owing, that <hi>New-England,</hi> though ſhe has attain'd but little more than the Age of a Man, with all the Diſadvantages under which ſhe labours in
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:002216_0027_0FDACFCB51F87E90"/>
reſpect to her Trade and Climate, and almoſt a perpetual <hi>Indian</hi> War, has hitherto flouriſh'd far above any other of the Plantations.</p>
            <p>THIS being the Caſe of the Charter Governments, let us turn the Tables, and ſee how it far'd with them when in an <hi>evil Reign</hi> they loſt their Charters. Then the Governour or <hi>New-England</hi> with Four or Five Strangers of his Council, Men of deſperate Fortunes, and bad if any Principles, made what Laws, and levy'd what Taxes they pleas'd on the People. They with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out an Aſſembly, rais'd a Penny in the Pound on all the Eſtates in the Country, and another Penny on all im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported Goods, beſides Twenty Pence <hi>per</hi> Head as Poll Money, and an immoderate Exciſe on Wine, Rum, and other Liquors. Several worthy Perſons, having in an humble Addreſs repreſented this Proceeding as a Grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance, were committed to the common Goal for a High Miſdemanour; deny'd the Benefit of the <hi>Habeas Corpus</hi> Act; try'd out of their own County; fin'd exorbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tantly, and oblig'd to pay 160 <hi>l.</hi> for Fees, when the Proſecution would hardly have coſt them ſo many Shillings in <hi>Great Britain.</hi> And to compleat the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion, when they upon their Tryal claim'd the Privileges of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> they were ſcoffingly told, <hi>Thoſe Things would not follow them to the Ends of the Earth.</hi> Unnatural Inſult; muſt the brave Adventurer, who with the Hazard of his Life and Fortune, ſeeks out new Climates to inrich his Mother Country, be deny'd thoſe common Rights, which his Countrymen enjoy at Home in Eaſe and Indolence? Is he to be made miſerable, and a Slave by his own Acquiſitions? Is the Labourer alone unworthy of his Hire, and ſhall they <hi>only</hi> reap, who have neither ſow'd nor planted? Monſtrous Abſurdity! Horrid inverted Order!</p>
            <p>THESE Proceedings, however Arbitrary and Oppreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive, were but the Prelude: The Cataſtrophe was, if poſſible, yet more diſmal. Having invaded their Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties, by an eaſy Tranſition the next Attack was di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly on their Properties. Their Title to their Lands
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:002216_0028_0FDACFCCE95C3220"/>
was abſolutely deny'd by the Governour and his Crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures upon two pretences: One, that their Conveyances were not according to the Law of <hi>England</hi>; the Other, that if they might be thought to have had ſomething like a Title formerly, yet it now ceas'd by the Revoca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their Charters. So that they who had fairly purchas'd their Lands, and held them in quiet Poſſeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on for above Fifty Years, were now oblig'd to accept new Deeds from the Governour and pay for them a third Part of their Value, in order to aſcertain their Titles or otherwiſe they would be ſeized for the Crown.</p>
            <p>IT would be an Injury to Vertue, if I did not in this Place pay diſtinguiſh'd Honour to the Memory of an honeſt and worthy Patriot, Col. <hi>Shrimpton</hi> long ſince deceas'd, who being rich in Lands, was courted to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive new Patents <hi>gratis,</hi> that others might be drawn in by the Authority of his Example; but when he was appriz'd of their Deſign, he choſe rather to have his Lands ſeiz'd (and they were ſeiz'd) than by ſuch a baſe Complyance betray his Countrymen into the Snares prepar'd for them. I ſhould not have thus far entred into the Detail of Things ſo long paſt, but to ſhow from Experience, as well as from the Reaſon and Nature of the Thing, that Charters are not the <hi>Cauſes</hi> of Arbitrary Government, but indeed <hi>strong Works</hi> rais'd againſt it, which once thrown down, Oppreſſion ruſhes in like a Tide, and bears down every thing before it.</p>
            <p>HAVING thus anſwer'd the Allegations of the Bill, in a Manner which I hope may be ſatisfactory, I am next to conſider ſuch Arguments as I have met with in Converſation from Perſons in the Miniſtry and others.</p>
            <p>WHAT I have heard moſt inſiſted on is,<note place="margin">The Third Objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that the Acts of Trade are diſre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>garded, <hi>anſwer'd.</hi>
               </note>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>That the Acts of Trade and Naviga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, made on purpoſe to render the Plantations beneficial to</hi> Great-Britain, <hi>are diſregarded in the Charter Governments; and that this Evil cannot be effectually cur'd, but by a Reſumption of the Charters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="26" facs="unknown:002216_0029_0FDACFCE52FE32A8"/>TO which I anſwer very particularly and diſtinctly,</p>
            <p n="1">1<hi>ſt.</hi> THE Complaints on this Head are for the moſt Part of an old Date, and when the Bill againſt the Charters was depending in the Houſe of Commons, were produc'd from the Files of the Plantation Board, whither they had bin tranſmitted in former Reigns, when Cuſtom-houſe Officers in the Plantations were ſuch great Rarities, that One Collector ſerv'd Four en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tire Provinces. And can it be thought ſtrange that Merchants, whoſe Buſineſs is Gain, ſhould have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times for Lucre tranſgreſs'd the Acts of Trade, when there were no Officers to ſee them duly obſerv'd? The Caſe is vaſtly different now. Officers of the Revenue are multiply'd, and are extremely rigorous, ſo that in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>their</hi> Complaints of unfair Traders, the Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chants on the other hand greatly complain of the Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion of the Officers. Ive ſeen an Account of ſuch intollerable Hardſhips impos'd on fair well-meaning Traders, under Colour of Law, that one would hardly give Credit to the leaſt of the Articles, if the Whole had not bin deliver'd publickly in an Aſſembly of one of the Provinces by a worthy Member, and afterwards printed with his name to it. The Author I refer to, after a Recital of the ſeveral Facts, in which he is very full as to every Circumſtance, draws up this melanchol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Concluſion, That the Cuſtom-Houſe Officers had by their violent Practices either ſeiz'd or driven away all the Veſſels belonging to that Part of the Country, ſo that they had no Sloops left to carry their Produce to Market in the adjacent Colonies.</p>
            <p n="2">2<hi>dly.</hi> IF there be ſome <hi>late</hi> Complaints, perhaps up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on Examination, they will appear to be ill grounded. I can ſpeak this knowingly with reſpect to a Complaint, tranſmitted not long ſince by the Surveyor General of <hi>North America</hi> and the Collector of <hi>New London,</hi> againſt His Majeſty's Colony of <hi>Connecticut.</hi> Theſe Gentlemen, one or both of them, drew up a Charge againſt that innocent and loyal Colony in very ſevere Terms, as <hi>ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting the Laws of Trade and Navigation at the utmoſt De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fiance.</hi> Whereas in Truth and in Fact, the Inſtances
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:002216_0030_0FDACFCFDB9D4A48"/>
they produc'd of ſuch Defiance were clear Proofs of that Colony's Inclination to ſupport the Laws of Trade and their own Traffick; and on the contrary, what the Cuſtom-Houſe Officers inſiſted on was manifeſtly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſive of both, and could ſerve no End in the World but enhancing the Collectors Fees. The Caſe is this: There are on the Coaſt of His Majeſty's Colony of <hi>Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>necticut</hi> Eight convenient Ports or Harbours for Ship<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ping. The Government there did from the Beginning place a Naval Officer in each of them, to ſee that the ſeveral Acts of Trade were duly obſerv'd. After the Act of the 7th and 8th of King <hi>William,</hi> the Collector of the Colony appointed a Deputy in each of theſe Ports, who requir'd all Maſters of Veſſels, Outward and Inward-bound, to Enter and Clear with him as well as with the Naval Officer, whether they had any Goods on Board paying a Duty to the Crown or not; which they ſubmitted to, tho' not oblig'd by Law, as Sir <hi>Wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liam Thompſon</hi> the late Sollicitor General has upon a full and impartial State of the Caſe given his Opinion. The preſent Collector, thinking it beſt to receive all the Fees himſelf, refuſes to make any Deputations, or allow the Power of the Naval Officers to be ſufficient in his Abſence, but commands all Maſters of Veſſels whatſoever to repair to the Port of his Reſidence, and there to Enter and Clear with him: By which Regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation Seven of the Eight Ports are left open for ille<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Traders, to the great Detriment of the Crown; whilſt with equal Injury to the Subject, Sloops ſailing from one Town to another, or perhaps to a neighbour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Province with no better a Cargo than a few Deals and Turnips, ſhall be oblig'd to go ſometimes 120 Miles out of their Way, which often happens to be further than the Port of Delivery, to find the Collector. The Agent for the Colony has fully repreſented this Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip to the Commiſſioners of the Cuſtoms, and ſhown the Injury that will be done to the King as well as the Subject by this Eſtabliſhment; but all in vain, there is no Redreſs; and what puts one out of all Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tience,
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:002216_0031_0FDACFD152B17A08"/>
this very Caſe is cited as one Allegation among others to ſupport the General Charge againſt the Char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Governments that they carry on an illegal Commerce.</p>
            <p n="3">3<hi>dly.</hi> IF IT were true that ſome Perſons did now and then concern themſelves in an illegal Trade, can it be thought juſt or reaſonable that the whole Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity ſhould ſuffer for their private fault? No Body will ſay that the Acts of Trade are perfectly obſerv'd in the Provinces immediately under the Crown, or in <hi>Great-Britain</hi> it ſelf. I believe there is no Corporati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on in the Kingdom, being a Sea-Port, wherein there are not at ſome Time or other contraband Goods im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported, or other Goods clandeſtinely run, to the preju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dice of the King's Duties. In this Port of <hi>London</hi> great Abuſes are daily committed in ſpight of the utmoſt Vigilance to prevent them. The Fraud of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>landing Callicoes after a pretended Exportation, only to receive the Drawback, is a moſt flagrant Inſtance, if One either conſiders the Perjuries that attend it, or the immenſe Sums that are thereby rob'd from the Publick, or the vaſt Injuries that are done by it to the honeſt Linen-Draper. And yet, whoever us'd this, or any other Cheat of the like Kind, as an Argument to disfranchiſe this Ancient Corporation? The Rule of Law is, <hi>Noxa Caput ſequitur</hi>; and it is agreeable to Natural Juſtice that every Man ſhould ſuffer for his own Tranſgreſſion. On the other part, if a Corpo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate Body were to forfeit their Privileges for every private Perſon's Offence, they would be of no Value. A Charter ſo limited could not ſtand a Week, nor would be worth the Expence of the Great Seal.</p>
            <p n="4">4<hi>thly.</hi> I MIGHT ſtill make a further Remark. If the Grievances complain'd of were not antiquated Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, but ſubſiſting at this Time; if they were fairly repreſented; and laſtly, if it were equitable that the Crimes of Perſons in a private Capacity ſhould be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piated by the Publick, yet no Concluſion could be drawn from theſe Premiſes prejudicial to the Charters, becauſe the diſſolving them would be no Remedy in
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:002216_0032_0FDACFD2D1BEF800"/>
any ſort. The Reaſon is plain, that putting this Caſe, not only the Inſpection of Trade, but the Proſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, Tryal, and Puniſhment of every Offender would reſt in the ſame Hands, and be carry'd on in the ſame Manner as before. All the Officers of the Revenue are <hi>in the preſent State of Things</hi> appointed by the Crown; all Breaches of the Acts of Trade, ſaving a ſingle one excepted by Act of Parliament, are cognizable only in the Court of Admiralty, where the Judge and every inferiour Officer are created either by Commiſſions un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the Broad Seal, or by Warrants from the Lord High Admiral. The Laws of the Country are not plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded in that Court, but Acts of Parliament, and when, they are ſilent, the Civil and Maritime Laws take place. The Forms of Proceeding, were <hi>they</hi> of any Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence, are regulated after the Manner practis'd in <hi>Doctors Commons.</hi> If then his Majeſty ſhould reſume the Charters, nothing more could be done to preſerve the Acts of Trade than is at preſent, and therefore how plauſible ſoever this Pretext may appear at firſt ſight, it's plain upon a nearer View that there is no Weight in it.</p>
            <p>I am appriz'd that the Judge of the Vice-Admiralty in <hi>New-England</hi> has often complain'd home of the fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent Prohibitions ſerv'd on him from the Courts of Judicature there, which he ſays, <hi>Weaken and in a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner ſuppreſs the Authority of that Court, and all the good Ends for which it was constituted.</hi> But neither does this Matter in the leaſt relate to the Charters, though there were Reaſon for the Complaint, as on the other hand, I ſhall immediately ſhow there is none. The Right of the Courts of Common Law within the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vince of the <hi>Maſſachuſets,</hi> to reſtrain the Exceſſes of the Admiralty Juriſdiction, are not deriv'd from their Charter, but from ſubſequent Laws of the Province, confirm'd afterwards by the Crown; which Power therefore, whether the Charters ſtand or fall, will re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main unhurt, and ſtill the ſame. But the Matter of this Complaint is wholly groundleſs, which I muſt
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:002216_0033_0FDACFD482210370"/>
particularly ſhow, becauſe a Handle has bin taken from it to hurt <hi>New-England</hi> in its Charters. I therefore take leave to ſay, That the ſuperiour Court of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for the Province of the <hi>Maſſachuſet's</hi> Bay has a le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gal Power to iſſue Prohibitions to the Court of Vice- Admiralty: That it is very fitting and neceſſary ſuch a Power ſhould be lodg'd in that Court: And, laſtly, that the particular Caſes wherein the Judges of that ſuperiour Court have hitherto exercis'd this Power, were apparently without and beyond the Admiralty Juriſdiction.</p>
            <p>To begin with the Power it ſelf: 'Tis founded on an Act of the Aſſembly paſs'd in the 11th Year of King <hi>William,</hi> and by him confirm'd, entitl'd, <hi>An Act for establiſhing a ſuperiour Court of Judicature, Court of Aſſizes and General Goal Delivery.</hi> The Act after a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cital of ſeveral Powers veſted in the Court, has this general Clauſe: <hi>And the ſaid Court is hereby veſted with the ſame Power as fully and amply to all Intents and Pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes whatſoever as the Courts of</hi> King's Bench, Common- Pleas <hi>and</hi> Exchequer <hi>within His Majesty's Kingdom of</hi> Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land <hi>have or ought to have.</hi> By Conſequence then, if the Court of <hi>King's-Bench</hi> has a Power to reſtrain the Court of <hi>Admiralty</hi> in <hi>England,</hi> this Court of Judica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture muſt have the ſame in <hi>New-England.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE Reaſons for ſuch a Reſtraining Power are as ſtrong in <hi>New-England</hi> as in <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> It has bin ever boaſted as the peculiar Privilege of an <hi>Engliſhman,</hi> &amp; the grand Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of his Property to be try'd by his Country and the Laws of the Land; whereas this Admiralty Method of Tryal deprives him of both, as it puts his Eſtate in the Diſpoſal of a ſingle Perſon, and makes the Civil Law the Rule of Judgment; which though it may not per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps properly he call'd Foreign, being the Law of Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, yet 'tis what he has not conſented to himſelf, of his Repreſentative for him. A Juriſdiction therefore ſo ſounded ought not to extend beyond what Neceſſity requires, that is, to nothing but what is really<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> tranſac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on the High Seas, which not being <hi>infra Corpus
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:002216_0034_0FDACFD5D6E90D20"/>
Comitatus,</hi> is not triable at Common Law. If ſome Bounds are not ſet to the Juriſdiction of the Admiral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, beyond which it ſhall not paſs, it may in Time, like the Element to which it ought to be confin'd, grow outrageous &amp; overflow the Banks of all the other Courts of Juſtice. This Danger is ſtill greater in the Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, where neither the Judge nor any of the Inferior Officers of the Admiralty have Salaries, or perhaps other Dependance than upon what they get by their Fees, and therefore muſt be ſtrongly tempted to receive all Buſineſs that comes before them, however improper for their Cognizance.</p>
            <p>IN vain do the Advocates for the Admiralty urge on this Occaſion that an Appeal lies home, and therefore if a Cauſe try'd there be found to be <hi>Coram non Judice,</hi> Juſtice will be done to the injur'd Party on the Appeal. For if this Argument has any Force, it would take place in <hi>England,</hi> becauſe an Appeal lies here from the Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences of the Admiralty to the Court of Delegates, and yet that is not thought a ſufficient Reaſon to prevent the Court of <hi>King's-Bench</hi> from granting Prohibitions when they think them neceſſary. Beſides it is to be remark'd, that the Appeal does not lie to the <hi>King</hi> and Council as it does from other Courts, but to the Judge of the Admiralty<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and therefore one may imagine that the Appellant will have but a <hi>cold Cauſe</hi> of it; for I believe it has bin rarely found that any Court was for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward to limit its own Power.</p>
            <p>IF then the Court of Judicature in <hi>New-England</hi> has a right in general to award Prohibitions againſt the Court of Vice-Admiralty, there will, I believe be no Diſpute as to the particular Inſtances wherein they have exercis'd this Power. Hitherto there have bin but Three; nor did the Judges come into theſe, but upon ſolemn Argument firſt had before them by the ableſt Lawyers on the Spot. Not that I ſuppoſe there was any real Difficulty, but it being a Caſe <hi>prima Impreſſionis</hi> in that Country, 'twas thought proper to proceed ſo delibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="32" facs="unknown:002216_0035_0FDACFD751A96C60"/>ONE Prohibition was granted on a Libel fil'd upon the Wool Act of the 10th and 11th of <hi>William</hi> III. which provides, That all Offences therein mention'd ſhall be try'd in ſome <hi>Court of Record,</hi> which 'tis cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain the Court of Admiralty is not. Another was iſſu'd to ſtop Proceedings in a Cauſe which had bin try'd before at Common Law, and receiv'd the Judgment of the Court. If the Court of Vice-Admiralty ſhould aſſume ſuch a Prerogative as this, inſtead of being confin'd to Maritime Affairs, it would be the Supreme Court in all Cauſes, and the <hi>Dernier Reſort</hi> of Juſtice. The Third Prohibition was upon a Charter Party made and execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon the Land with a Penalty under Hand &amp; Seal, which nevertheleſs was libell'd in the Court of Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ralty, and the Judge would very gravely have heard and determin'd it, on a Colour of it's having relation to a Voyage, or at leaſt to ſomething which was to be perform'd on the Seas. Altho' this is ſo far from being a good Reaſon, that there are many Caſes in the Books, where a Cauſe has bin <hi>wholly Maritime,</hi> and even the Contract made upon the High Seas, yet becauſe it was reduc'd to Writing afterwards and Seal'd on the Shore, it has bin adjudg'd to be without the Admiralty Juriſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction. My Lord <hi>Coke</hi> is ſo clear and full upon this Subject, and the Limits of the Admiralty Juriſdiction are ſo exactly deſcrib'd in the ſeveral Acts of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment made for this End, to ſay nothing of the Caſes in the Books, where great Damages are given for in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fringing the Rights of the Common Law, that I ſhall re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to them <note n="*" place="bottom">

               <pb n="33" facs="unknown:002216_0036_0FDACFD996281A98"/>ANOTHER Thing alledg'd againſt the <hi>American</hi> Charters is,<note place="margin">The <hi>4</hi>th <hi>Objection</hi> That they have made Laws repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Laws of <hi>Great Britain,</hi> anſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wer'd.</note> 
               <hi>That their Governments have made Laws repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Laws of</hi> Great-Britain <hi>contrary to the Powers given them, and thereby have incurr'd a Forfeiture of the Charters.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IF the <hi>Maſſachuſet</hi> Charter were ſingly in Queſtion, this Allegation would have no place, becauſe no Act paſs'd by that Aſſembly has the Force of a Law till the King's Governour has aſſented to it, and then it comes home for his Majeſty's Approbation, who if he pleaſes, annuls it. There is therefore no Danger of their making Laws repugnant to the Laws of <hi>Great-Britain</hi>; or if they ſhould, there being a Remedy al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways at hand, if it be not made uſe of, the Fault will lie ſome where elſe, and can't affect the Province.</p>
            <p>BUT let us examine a little, whether any of the other Governments acting under Charters may deſerve this Cenſure<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> in order to which, we muſt conſider what this Phraſe [REPUGNANT TO THE LAWS OF ENGLAND] imports. I believe it will be eaſily al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low'd, that a Law may be <hi>various</hi> from the Laws of <hi>England,</hi> and yet not <hi>repugnant</hi> to them; or otherwiſe theſe Governments muſt make no Laws at all, which no Body will ſay, who knows that a Right of Legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the moſt eſſential Part of their Charters, and what indeed the Reaſon and Nature of the Thing make abſolutely neceſſary. Every Country has Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances peculiar to it ſelf in Reſpect of its Soil, Si<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tuation, Inhabitants, and Commerce, to all which con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venient Laws muſt with the niceſt Care and Judgment be adapted; whereas the Laws of <hi>England</hi> are calcula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted for their own Meridian, and are many of them no ways ſuitable to the Plantations, and others not poſſible to be executed there.</p>
            <p>THIS Point, however clear and evident, has not bin always rightly underſtood. There was a pretty extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary Inſtance of it a few Years ſince, with reſpect
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:002216_0037_0FDACFDB13E7EAB0"/>
to a Law in force in <hi>Carolina</hi> for chooſing Jury-men by Ballot. This was part of their Original Body of Laws fram'd by the famous Earl of <hi>Shaftsbury,</hi> and what they had found by Experience a great Preſervative to their Liberties and Properties. Yet I don't know how it happen'd, the Lord Palatine and other Lords Proprie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors of that Province, imagining this Law to be repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to the Laws of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and that they ſhould thereby incur a Forfeiture of their Charter, directed their Landgraves to get it repeal'd. The People in that Government, unwilling to part with what they ſo much eſteem'd, ſent over two Deputies expreſs to ſet the Matter in a fair Light before their Lordſhips. When they arriv'd, I accompany'd them at their Deſire to the Board, where after ſome ſhort Debates, we ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fy'd their Lordſhips that their Charter could be in no Danger on this Account, and that one Law might be various from another without being repugnant to it.</p>
            <p>HAVING premis'd this Diſtinction, I anſwer the Queſtion in direct Terms, That <hi>then a Law in the Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations may be ſaid to be repugnant to a Law made in</hi> Great-Britain, <hi>when it flatly contradicts it, ſo far as the Law made here mentions and relates to the Plantation. Contraria ſunt ad idem:</hi> And therefore one Thing can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be ſaid to be contrary to another, that does not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately relate to it, and diametrically oppoſe it. For the Purpoſe, if a Law paſs'd here has its Force re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrain'd to <hi>England, Wales,</hi> and the Town of <hi>Berwick</hi> on the <hi>Tweed,</hi> no Law in the Plantations can properly be ſaid to repugn it; becauſe whatever Diverſity there may be between them, yet one having no manner of Relation to the other, they are not repugnant. I be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve I am Right in my Logick, but am ſure I am as to the legal Acceptation of the Phraſe, becauſe what I advance is founded on the Words of an Act of Parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It is the 7<hi>th</hi> and 8<hi>th</hi> of King <hi>William,</hi> which (Cap. 22. Sect 9<hi>th.</hi>) Enacts, <hi>That all Laws, By-Laws, U<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſages or Cuſtoms at this Time, or which hereafter ſhall be in Practice, or endeavoured or pretended to be in Force
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:002216_0038_0FDACFDC9304E968"/>
or Practice in any of the Plantations, which are in any wiſe repugnant to the before-mention'd Laws or any of them,</hi> SO FAR AS THEY DO RELATE TO THE SAID PLANTATIONS OR ANY OF THEM, <hi>or which are any ways repugnant to this preſent Act, or to any other Law hereafter to be made in this Kingdom,</hi> SO FAR AS SUCH LAW SHALL RELATE TO AND MENTION THE SAID PLANTATIONS, <hi>are illegal, null, and void, to all Intents and Purpoſes whatſoever.</hi> If then we'll take the Senſe of the Phraſe from an Act of Parliament, (and where can we have a better Expoſitor?) no Man will pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend that there ever was a Law made in the Plantati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons repugnant to the Laws of <hi>Great-Britain.</hi> And yet I am apt to think that if an Aſſembly ſhould do a Thing ſo illegal, they ought to be puniſh'd for it themſelves, and not their Conſtituents. They were choſen and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated by the People to frame Laws according to the Powers given them by their reſpective Charters, which if they exceed, why ſhould a whole Country ſuffer for their Offence? This would be to puniſh the Innocent for the Guilty, and is not agreeable to the Law in other Caſes, where if the Truſtee does any Act that is illegal and beyond his Truſt, the <hi>Cestuyq. Truſt</hi> is not oblig'd by it, nor to be hurt for it.</p>
            <p>IF the Words will receive any other Conſtruction than what the Act of Parliament has put upon them, I think it muſt be ſuppos'd to be this; that the Paten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tees ſhould not under colour of their particular Charters preſume to make any Laws inconſiſtent with the great Charter and other Laws of <hi>England,</hi> by which the Lives, Liberties and Properties of <hi>Engliſhmen</hi> are ſecur'd. It ſeems reaſonable enough to think that the Crown might intend by this Injunction to provide for all it's Subjects, that they might not be oppreſs'd by arbitrary Power; but in whatever diſtant Part of the World they were ſettled, being ſtill Subjects, they ſhould have the Uſage of <hi>Engliſhmen,</hi> be protected by the ſame mild Laws, &amp; enjoy the ſame happy Government, as if they continued within the Realm. Conſider the Expreſſion in this Light, and the Colonies (which I am defending) are ſtill ſafe,
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:002216_0039_0FDACFDE122B88F8"/>
having in no reſpect impair'd, but many Ways improv'd the Liberty of the Subject, as I have before ſhown un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der another Head. If hereafter ſo unaccountable a Thing ſhould happen, that thoſe Privileges which were deſign'd as Fences againſt Oppreſſion and Deſpotick Power prove the means to introduce both, and the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of the People ſhould petition to be reliev'd from the Yoke of their Charters, for my part, I'll be no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er an Advocate for them. Only in the mean Time, I heartily wiſh they may not be diſturb'd, but reſt in Peace till then.</p>
            <p>
               <note place="margin">A <hi>5</hi>th Objection, that the Charter Colonies will grow great and formida<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. <hi>anſwer'd.</hi>
               </note>THERE is one Thing more I have heard often urg'd againſt the Charter Colonies, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed 'tis what one meets with from People of all Conditions and Qualities, tho' with due reſpect to their better Judgments, I can ſee neither Reaſon nor Colour for it. 'Tis ſaid, <hi>that their encreaſing Numbers and Wealth join'd to their great Diſtance from</hi> Britain <hi>will give them an Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portunity in the Courſe of ſome Years to throw off their De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendance on the Nation, and declare themſelves a free State, if not curb'd in Time by being made entirely ſubject to the Crown.</hi> Whereas in Truth there's no Body tho' but little acquainted with theſe or any of the <hi>Northern</hi> Plantations, who does not know and confeſs, that their Poverty and the declining State of their Trade is ſo great at preſent<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that there's far more Danger of their linking, without ſome extraordinary Support from the Crown, than of their ever revolting from it. So that I may ſay without being ludicrous, that it would not be more abſurd to place two of His Majeſty's Beef-Eat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers to watch an Infant in the Cradle that it don't riſe and cut its Father's Throat, than to guard theſe weak Infant Colonies to prevent their ſhaking off the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Yoke. Beſides, they are ſo diſtinct from one another in their Forms of Government, in their Religious Rites, in their Emulation of Trade, and conſequently in their Affections, that they can never be ſuppos'd to unite in
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:002216_0040_0FDACFDF94A241D0"/>
ſo dangerous an Enterprize. It is for this Reaſon I have often wondered to hear ſome Great Men profeſs their Belief of the Feaſibleneſs of it, and the Probability of i'ts ſome Time or other actually coming to paſs, who yet with the ſame Breath adviſe that all the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments on the Continent be form'd into one, by being brought under one Vice-Roy, and into one Aſſembly. For ſurely if we in earneſt believ'd that there was or would be hereafter a Diſpoſition in the Provinces to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bel and declare themſelves Independent, it would be good Policy to keep them diſunited; becauſe if it were poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble they could contrive ſo wild and raſh an Undertaking, yet they would not be hardy enough to put it in Exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution, unleſs they could firſt ſtrengthen themſelves by a Confederacy of all the Parts.</p>
            <p>BUT to return from this ſhort Digreſſion: Our Neigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bours of <hi>Holland,</hi> who are allow'd to be a wiſe State, did not entertain theſe Jealouſies of their Subjects in <hi>India,</hi> when they were a young &amp; growing Plantation, nor do they even now when they are a potent flouriſhing People. Had they done ſo, and in conſequence of it reſtrain'd and check'd them, <hi>Holland</hi> would not at this Day have drawn ſuch immenſe Riches from that Part of the World, and furniſh'd all <hi>Europe</hi> with <hi>Indian</hi> Commodities. And yet what Reaſon can be aſſign'd for the Jealouſies we enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our Colonies, which the <hi>Dutch</hi> have not, and far ſtronger with reſpect to their <hi>Batavian</hi> Subjects? If the Diſtance be urg'd as an Argument, every body knows that <hi>New-England</hi> is but a thouſand Leagues from the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Shore, but the <hi>Dutch</hi> muſt run eight Times that Ground from <hi>Amſterdam</hi> before they arrive at <hi>Batavia,</hi> Or if the Number and Power of the Inhabitants ſhould give any Umbrage, this is an Article which with reſpect to <hi>Batavia</hi> won't admit of the moſt diſtant Compariſon. The General of that Place maintains a Port ſuperiour to many Sovereign Princes in <hi>Europe,</hi> and has all the Kings in <hi>Java</hi> in a manner Tributary to him. He has 3000 ſtanding European Troops, not reckoning the Natives<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> &amp; all the <hi>Dutch</hi> Inhabitants live in that flowing Wealth and Plenty which makes <hi>Batavia</hi> look like the Capital of a Great &amp; Migh<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>ty
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:002216_0041_0FDACFE1387483C0"/>
Empire. But do the States of <hi>Holland</hi> look on this their proſperous Condition with envious or jealous Eyes? Juſt the reverſe; they do every thing in their Power ſtill to promote and advance it, well knowing their foreign Plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations can't thrive, but they muſt receive the Benefit of it themſelves, and therefore juſtly eſteem the Wealth of their Subjects Abroad as their own Riches. Why then ſhould not <hi>Great-Britain</hi> form the ſame Judgment, and proceed by the like Meaſures in regard to her <hi>American</hi> Dominions, from whence ſhe receives the greateſt Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages? It were no difficult Task to prove that <hi>London</hi> has riſen out of the Plantations, and not out of <hi>England.</hi> 'Tis to them we owe our vaſt Fleets of Merchant Ships, and conſequently the Increaſe of our Seamen, and Improve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of our Navigation. 'Tis their Tobacco, Sugar, Fiſh, Oil, Logwood and other Commodities, which have ena<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled us to ſupport our Trade in <hi>Europe,</hi> to bring the Bal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lance of ſome Countries in our Favour, which would o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwiſe be againſt us, and to make the Figure we do at preſent, and have done for near a Century paſt, in all Parts of the commercial World.</p>
            <p>THE Mother Kingdom muſt therefore needs rejoyce in the Proſperity of every one of her Colonies, becauſe it is her own Proſperity. The Fable of the Belly and Members illuſtrates this Argument. It would be unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſonable for the Belly to grudge the Labour of digeſting the Food and diſperſing the Blood and Juices to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tream Parts, ſeeing they return purify'd and exalted in the Circulation. There's a cloſe Analogy between the Natural Body and the Body Politick; as in the one, a Finger can't ake, but the Whole feels it, ſo in the other the remoteſt Plantation can't decay, but the Nation muſt ſuffer with it.</p>
            <p>IF it be ſaid that the Charter Colonies are not ſo va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable as ſome of the reſt, I anſwer, that the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants have the more need of their Charters to make them amends; for People muſt have ſome Incourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſit down on a cold and barren Soil. Yet I have ſhown before that they are many ways of great Uſe and Advantage to the Crown; to which I add, that they will be more ſo than ever in a few Years, to ſtrengthen the <hi>Britiſh</hi> Empire in <hi>America</hi> againſt the
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:002216_0042_0FDACFE2928AD768"/>
formidable Settlement of <hi>Loiſiana,</hi> which for ſome Years paſt has bin carry'd on by the <hi>French</hi> with great Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, and with the utmoſt Vigour and Application. This Country was given by the late <hi>French</hi> King to the <hi>SieurCroizat,</hi> but is now (as every Body knows) in the famous <hi>Miſſiſippi</hi> Company, who have a Fund of a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred Millions of Livres for this very Purpoſe, and are daily ſending over a vaſt Number of People for Tillage, as well as all ſorts of Artificers, with proper Materials for making a Settlement. It is ſituate on the great Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver of <hi>Miſſiſippi,</hi> and by help of the ſuperiour Lakes and Rivers, on ſome of which the <hi>French</hi> have already erec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Fortreſſes, a Communication may be made between <hi>New-France</hi> and the Gulph of <hi>Mexico,</hi> which indeed was the very Scheme of the <hi>French</hi> Court in projecting this Enterprize, as is expreſly declar'd in the Preamble to <hi>Croizat</hi>'s Patent. 'Tis eaſy then to ſee that the <hi>French</hi> will be hereby enabled to draw a Line, and in Time have a Chain of Towns on the Back of all our Colonies from the Borders of <hi>Cape-Breton</hi> to the weſtermoſt Part of <hi>Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rolina.</hi> And what <hi>Briton</hi> can conſider this without being in Pain for the Fate of our Provinces in future Times? Eſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pecially ſince we know that the <hi>Illinois</hi> and other War<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like <hi>Indian</hi> Nations lye near the <hi>French,</hi> and for many Reaſons, which it would be too much a Digreſſion to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count here, are devoted to their Intereſt, and by conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence ready at all Times to joyn their Forces in any Attempt againſt us.</p>
            <p>THIS being the Caſe, I think with humble Submiſſion, it is very prepoſterous to amuſe our ſelves with vain, i<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maginary Proſpects of what is ſcarce poſſible to come to paſs, &amp; neglect doing what is abſolutely neceſſary; I mean, the enlarging and ſupporting our Provinces, that they may be able to defend themſelves againſt being one Day totally extirpated by a Foreign Power. And then I have only to ſuggeſt an old approv'd Maxim, <hi>That every Thing is beſt preſerv'd by the ſame Principles by which it was at firſt form'd,</hi> and conſequently the beſt Method of en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraging the Charter Colonies is, to preſerve their Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vileges inviolate, without which they had never bin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſetled.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="40" facs="unknown:002216_0043_0FDACFE414917CD8"/>
               <note place="margin">The <hi>3</hi>d <hi>Propoſition,</hi> That it is not the In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tereſt of the Crown to reſume the Charters f forfeited.</note>ANOTHER Propoſition I advanced was, That if theſe Governments ſhould be adjudg'd to have forfeited their Charters back to the Crown, yet it is not the true Intereſt of the Crown to reſume them.</p>
            <p>IT is a generally receiv'd Opinion, that the People in the Plantations have an Intereſt diſtinct from that of the Crown; when it is ſuppoſed at the ſame time, that the Intereſt of the Governours, they being the King's Repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentatives, is one with the Crown; and from theſe Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes it is concluded, that there can't be too much Pow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er given to the Governours or too little to the People. Whereas, with humble Submiſſion, I conceive this to be a very wrong Judgment, and that the Reverſe of it is true. The only Intereſt of the People is to thrive and flouriſh in their Trade, which is the true Intereſt of the Crown and Nation, becauſe they reap the Profit of it. When on the other Hand, the View that Governours generally have is private Gain, which being too often acquir'd by diſcoura<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ging and oppreſſing Trade, is not only an Intereſt diſtinct from that of the Crown, but extreamly prejudicial to it. The Trade of a young Plantation is like a tender Plant, &amp; ſhould be cheriſh'd with the fondeſt Care; but if inſtead of that, it meets with the rough Hand of Oppreſſion, it will ſoon die. The proper Nurſery for this Plant is a free Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, where the Laws are ſacred, Property ſecure, &amp; Juſtice not only impartially, but expeditiouſly diſtributed. For to what purpoſe ſhall the Merchant expoſe his Eſtate to the Dangers of the Sea, the Enemy, and many more Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cidents, if after all he can't ſave it at Home from Rapine and Violence?</p>
            <p>As this is evident, ſo is it that whatever injures the Trade of the Plantations, muſt in Proportion affect <hi>Great- Britain,</hi> the Source and Center of their Commerce; from whence they have their Manufactures, whether they make their Returns, and where all their Superlucration is lodg'd. The Blow then may ſtrike the Colonies firſt, but it comes Home at laſt, and falls heavieſt on our ſelves.</p>
            <p>THAT Governours are apt to abuſe their Power and grow rich by Oppreſſion, Experience ſhows us. We have ſeen not many Years ſince, ſome Governours ſeiz'd by their Injur'd People, and ſent Priſoners to
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:002216_0044_0FDACFE592ABD0D0"/>
               <hi>Whitehall,</hi> there to anſwer for their Offences. Others have fallen Victims on the Spot, not to the Fury of a Faction or a Rabble, but to the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentment of the whole Body of the People, riſing as one Man to revenge their Wrongs. Others after being recall'd, have been proſecuted at the <hi>King's-Bench Bar,</hi> purſuant to an Act of Parliament made in the Reign of the late King <hi>William,</hi> whereby it is provided, That Gover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours ſhall be impleadable at Home for any Injuries done in their Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments Abroad. We have had more than one flagrant Inſtance of this very lately, where Governours have bin convicted and cenſur'd not ſo properly for oppreſſing, as for a direct plundering their People, and ſuch other Acts of Miſ-rule and lawleſs Power, as one would not have thought it poſſible they ſhould have committed if Experience had not ſhown it to be more than poſſible.</p>
            <p>I don't however intend by what is here ſaid, to reproach our own Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, as if we were greater Sinners than others, or to reflect on the preſent Times, as if they were worſe than the former. I know that the ſame Abuſes have bin practis'd in every Age as well as this, &amp; in Foreign Colonies as well as our own. The ancient <hi>Romans</hi> were as brave &amp; as vertuous a Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple as any in the World, and yet their Proconſuls or Governours were very guilty in this reſpect. Their Corruption was ſo notorious as to be diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſh'd by the Name of <hi>Crimen Repetundarum,</hi> a Phraſe not us'd in any other meaning, and deriv'd from the Obligation which the <hi>Roman</hi> Senate laid on their Governours to make Reſtitution.</p>
            <p>NOR have the modern Governours in the <hi>French</hi> &amp; <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Plantations bin leſs Criminal. It's a famous Story of a Great Miniſter at the Court of <hi>Madrid,</hi> who writ to his Friend the Vice-Roy of <hi>Peru,</hi> that great Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plaints were made againſt him for having extorted immenſe Sums of Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney from the People in his Government; <hi>Which,</hi> ſays he, <hi>I wiſh may be true, or elſe you are undone.</hi> It ſeems the ſame Thing that wounded him, was neceſſary to heal him; and what put him out of Favour, was the only Thing could reſtore him,</p>
            <p>INDEED it can hardly be expected but theſe Corruptions muſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, when one conſiders that few Gentlemen will croſs the Seas for a Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, whoſe Circumſtances are not a little ſtreight at Home, &amp; that they know by how ſlight &amp; uncertain a Tenure they hold their Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſions; from whence they wiſely conclude, that no Time is to be loſt. And then for the Account to be rendred at Home, that is not thought of at ſo great a Diſtance, for <hi>Procul a Jove, procul a Fulmine.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>TO enlarge then the Power of Governours, is to give them greater Power to oppreſs; and to vacate the Charters is to enlarge their Power, the Government in that Caſe of Courſe devolving upon them; as we ſee in thoſe Plantations which never had any Charters, but are imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately dependent on the Crown. There they have, in a manner, the intire Legiſlative &amp; Executive Powers, or at leaſt ſo great an Influence on the conſtituent Parts of the Former, as leaves them little <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> than Nominal Sharers, ſerving rather as Screens to the Govern <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> a Defence to the People. The Militia is abſolutely veſted in <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernours, which influences all Elections of Repreſentatives: They appoint Judges, Juſtices, Sheriffs and other Civil Officers with the Conſent, it's ſaid indeed, of the Council; but that ſuch Conſent voluntary or involuntary will ever be refus'd, ſeems too much to be expected, if we conſider
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:002216_0045_0FDACFE7172AAA00"/>
that altho' the Governours do not indeed appoint the Council, yet they recommend proper Perſons to the King; and it may be ſuppoſed, that a Gentleman who is intruſted with the chief Command of a Province, and is actually on the Spot, will be thought the beſt Judge who are fit to ſerve, and therefore his Recommendations will almoſt always prevail. Beſides, if there be a Turn to ſerve, or an Emergency real or imaginary, &amp; any of the Members ſhould be ſo refractory as not to give into his Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures with an implicit Faith, the Governour can ſuſpend as many of them as he pleaſes; and when he has reduc'd the Board under a Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber limited in his Inſtructions, he can then fill it up to that Number <hi>inſtanter</hi> with whom he pleaſes; and who will they be, may we pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume, but ſuch as are paſſively obedient to his Will? And too many ſuch there are to be found in all Colonies ſo conſtituted, who are con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent to be <hi>ſadled</hi> themſelves, provided they may <hi>ride</hi> others under the <hi>chief Rider.</hi> I muſt farther obſerve, that where there are no Charters, there are Courts of Equity eſtabliſh'd, in which the Governour is always Chancellor, and for the moſt part Chief Juſtice, and Ordinary at the ſame time; which puts the Eſtates, Lives and Liberties of the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants, ſaving the Liberty of Appeal at Home, intirely in his Diſpoſal; and even an Appeal in all Caſes under a conſiderable Sum, in all Caſe; of the ordinary Juriſdiction, and in all Caſes Capital, is either diſallow'd by his Inſtructions, or wholly in the Governour's Breaſt to allow or not</p>
            <p>THE Sum of my Argument is, That the Benefit which <hi>Great-Britain</hi> receives from the Plantations, ariſes from their Commerce: That Op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion is the moſt oppoſite Thing in the World to Commerce, and the moſt deſtructive Enemy it can have: That Governours have in all Times, and in all Countries, bin too much inclin'd to oppreſs. And con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequently it cannot be the Intereſt of the Nation to increaſe their Power, and leſſen the Liberties of the People. I am ſo ſanguine in this Opinion, that I really think it would be for the Service of the Crown &amp; Nation to incorporate thoſe Governments which have no Char<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap> rather than Disfranchize thoſe that have.</p>
            <p>THE laſt Thing I propos'd to conſider was,<note place="margin">The <hi>4</hi>th <hi>Propoſition,</hi> That it ſeems incon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with Juſtice to Diſfranchize the Charter Colonies by an Act of Parliament.</note>
how far it may be conſiſtent with Juſtice, to deprive the Colonies of their Charters, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out giving them a fair Tryal or any previous Notice.</p>
            <p>IT is certain, that Bills of Attainder, ſuch as this would be, have bin ſeldom us'd in <hi>England,</hi> and then only upon the moſt extraordinary Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions: As when flagrant Crimes have been committed of a new and unuſual Nature, againſt which the Law had made no Proviſion; or when the Witneſſes have avoided, and perhaps by the Contrivance of the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap>; or laſtly, which is the moſt common Caſe, when the attainted <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> having himſelf abſconded, and fled from Juſtice, has thereby made <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 span">
                  <desc>〈…〉</desc>
               </gap> extrajudicial Proceeding Juſtifiable. It is alſo as certain that neither of theſe Things can be pleaded in the preſent Caſe, which I need not be particular in ſhowing, becauſe not ſuggeſted, nor is there the leaſt Colour for ſuch Suggeſtion. And yet I pretend to know the People in the Charter Governments ſo well, and to be ſo thoroughly acquainted with their meek Principles of Obedience, that I dare affirm
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:002216_0046_0FDACFE923674350"/>
if ſuch an Act ſhould paſs, however rigorous and ſevere they might think it within themſelves, they would not let fall an indecent Word of their Superiours, but would receive the News with the loweſt Submiſſion: So great is their Loyalty to the King, and ſo profound their Regard for the Reſolutions of a <hi>Britiſh</hi> Parliament, the wiſeſt and moſt auguſt Aſſembly in the World. However, ſeeing there is no ſuch Act already paſs'd, and 'tis to be hop'd from the Honour &amp; Juſtice of Parliaments, never will, it can't be thought a Crime modeſtly to ſtate the Hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip of the Caſe: I don't mean with reſpect to the Merits of it, which have bin already conſider'd, but as to the <hi>Manner of Proceeding by Bill in Parliament.</hi> It is a moſt ſacred and unalterable Rule of Juſtice, and has ever bin ſo eſteem'd by all the civiliz'd Nations of the World, that no Perſon be depriv'd of Life, Liberty or Eſtate, or any thing he poſſeſſes, till he has had Time and Opportunity to make his Defence. And if the Matter in Judgment be of great Value, dearly paid for, and long enjoy'd, it adds much to the Weight of the Argument, and aggravates the Injury in depriving the Poſſeſſors unheard. Now this is the Caſe of the Charter Governments. How great the Purchaſe Conſideration was, has been before ſaid; but how valuable the Charters themſelves are can never be ſaid, Liberty being ineſtimable. And for the Time they have enjoy'd them, were they not on Record, it would be what the Civilians call <hi>Immemorial,</hi> one of them being above Fourſcore Years ſtanding. It ſeems therefore a Severity without a Precedent, that <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> People who have the Misfortune of being a Thouſand Leagues diſtant from their Sovereign, a Misfortune great enough in it ſelf, ſhould UNSUMMON'D, UNHEARD, IN ONE DAY be depriv'd of all their valuable Privileges, which they and their Fathers have enjoy'd for near a Hundred Years. It's true, the Legiſlative Power is abſolute and unaccountable, and King, Lords and Commons may do what they plea<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>, but the Queſtion here is not about <hi>Power,</hi> but <hi>Right: And ſhall not the Supream Judicature of all the Nation do right</hi>? One may ſay, that what <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> Parliament can't do juſtly, they can't do at all. <hi>In maximis minima eſt <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>ntia.</hi> The higher the Power is, the greater Caution is to be us'd in the Execution of it, becauſe the Sufferer is helpleſs &amp; without Reſort.</p>
            <p>WHEN in an Arbitrary Reign, the Charter of <hi>New-England</hi> was <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap>, a <hi>Quo Warranto</hi> firſt gave the Colony Notice to prepare for their Trial. Altho' this was a Proſecution at Law, and the High Court of Parliament is not ſtrictly confin'd to the Forms of the Courts below, yet it is not doubted but the great Fountain of Law &amp; Juſtice will have ſome regard, if not to all the Rules made for inferiour Judicatures, yet to ſuch as are Eſſential to Juſtice. And ſo in other Caſes it has. For the Purpoſe: If a Bill be brought into the Houſe of Commons that touches any Man's Property in <hi>Ireland,</hi> it muſt lie 30 Days, that the Party may have Notice and not ſuffer unheard. Why then ſhould not a reaſonable Time be allow'd to the Subjects in <hi>America,</hi> in Proportion to their more diſtant Situation; ſeeing they are no leſs the Subjects of the Crown, than the Inhabitants of <hi>Ireland</hi>; and Liberty is at leaſt as va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable as Property; and ſurely the concern of whole Provinces challen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges as much regard as the Intereſt of a ſingle Perſon. If it ſhould be ſaid, as I confeſs a great Miniſter once ſaid to me, That <hi>the Regulation of Charters muſt be look'd on as Part of the publick Oeconomy, and not as the Affair of any particular Perſon or Province</hi>; I humbly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehend,
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:002216_0047_0FDACFEA12CAAB40"/>
with the utmoſt Deference to that great Perſon, that this does not reach the preſent Caſe. It's indeed very reaſonable that all publick Affairs be ſubject to the Determination of the publick Wiſdom, and there's no Occaſion to notify any Body, becauſe every Body is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd to be preſent in the Repreſentative Body of the Whole; but here the Provinces to be cenſur'd &amp; depriv'd have no Repreſentative in Parliament, and conſequently muſt be conſider'd as abſent Perſons ſuffering unheard.</p>
            <p>I KNOW of but one thing more that can be ſaid to palliate a Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding againſt the Charters in this way, which is, <hi>That the Provin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces always have their reſpective Agents at Court, who may be heard by Petition before the Bill paſſes into an Act.</hi> To which I anſwer, firſt, that ſometimes they have Agents here, and at other Times they have not. Next, that a Bill may paſs into an Act without the Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of the Agents, they having no Citation. This had once like to have bin the Caſe, when a Bill of this Nature was formerly brought into the Houſe of Commons; and certainly had prov'd ſo, if the Agent for <hi>New-England</hi> had at that nice Juncture bin indiſpoſed in his Health, or but a Day's Journey out of Town, or if he had not bin more than ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rily active &amp; diligent when he was in Town. And, laſtly, I muſt oberve that Agents are only inſtructed in Things that fall within the ordinary Courſe of Buſineſs, &amp; when any thing of a new &amp; extraordinary Nature is brought on the Carpet, they have a general Inſtruction to pray for Time in order to notify their Principals, &amp; receive their ſpecial Commands. Beſides, it's well known that the Right Honourable the Lords Commiſſioners for Trade and Plantations were, at the Time before mentioned, prepared to urge many Complaints both New &amp; Old; to which Facts it had bin impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble for any Agent to anſwer <hi>oretenus,</hi> without being ever appriz'd of them. To conclude, what <hi>thoſe Governments</hi> deſire of their Superiours at home is, that they may not be judg'd and condemn'd unheard. And I cannot but flatter my ſelf they will obtain it, whether I conſider the Reaſonableneſs of the Demand it ſelf, or the celebrated Juſtice &amp; Lenity of His Majeſty's Government, or the Importance of the Thing in Queſtion to the Provinces concern'd. I mention this laſt particular, being ſure they would reckon the loſs of their Privileges a greater Calamity, than if their Houſes were all in Flames at once. Nor can they be juſtly blam'd, the one being a reparable Evil, but the other irreparable Burnt Houſes may riſe again out of their Aſhes, and even more Beautiful than before, but 'tis to be fear'd that Liberty <hi>once loſt, is loſt for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THUS I have ventur'd into the World my Thoughts on the <hi>New-England</hi> Charters; happy! if my imperfect Eſſay may provoke ſome learned Pen to do full Juſtice to the Subject, which yet in the great Scarcity of Friends that theſe Governments have, ſeems too much to be expected. In the mean Time, being my ſelf a Native of one of them, I could not forbear ſhowing my Good-will; for how little ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever one is able to write, yet when the Liberties of one's Country are threatned, it's ſtill more difficult to be ſilent. The Dumb Son of <hi>Craeſus,</hi> when he ſaw an Attempt made on his Father's Life, broke into ſudden Speech by a ſtrong Effort of Nature. It's a fine Paſſage in <hi>Salluſt,</hi> which I've plac'd in the Title Page of this little Work, <hi>Pulchrum eſt Patriae benefacere, etiam benedicere haud abſurdum eſt.</hi> Every Man would be <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">
