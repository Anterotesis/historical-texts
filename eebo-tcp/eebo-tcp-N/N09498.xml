            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>AN ANSWER TO JUNIUS.</head>
            <p>Faction may be resembled to bodies in their descent; their motion is increased in proportion to the space they fall through. No great degree of sagacity was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quisite to foretel, that a writer, who had malevelently attacked the greatest Officers of State, would at last lay his hand upon the Throne, and shake even the Monarch, who wished he would not forfeit every title to clemency. An animated style, is far from investing a subject with a right to raise himself upon a level with his Sovereign, and to arraign his conduct in terms, that show <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">
                  <desc>〈◊〉</desc>
               </gap> total disregard both to decency and allegiance; but supposing such an outrage could at any time exist, supposing the Sovereign should lay aside the sceptre and descend to the character of a fellow-subject, he might express himself in terms of this kind; which, though abstracted from the forms of Royalty, might still convey his ideas in expressions drawn from his real character, and breathe all the benevolence of one who is paternally affected for the welfare of his subjects.</p>
            <p>I Am not surprized at the attack lately received from the pen of <hi>Iunius,</hi> his pen spares no characters. Impunity instead of furnishing him with suspicion, has hardened him in effrontery. But calumny and sedition is the characteristic of the age; he may have been willingly carried down the stream, because it will land on the shore of popularity.</p>
            <p>To abuse extraordinary talents, is <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 word">

Had <hi>Iunius</hi> urged any thing wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy of notice, unless it be for its malignity, he would have been indulged all the freedom of a patriot, and I would have laid aside the King, to become a disciple.</p>
            <p>A long letter which has a tendency to disturb the tranquility of my reign, is stretched out to its enormous length by trite maxims, and every artifice is employed to alienate the affections of my subjects. The charms of novelty are neglected to introduce the poison of malignity, and I am to be exposed to my people for being in the same circumstances as other Kings have been in before me — it has been frequently observed by the votaries of the people, that the voice of truth seldom reaches the ears of a King. This may too often be the case with weak and arbitrary Princes, but will my greatest enemy, will even <hi>Iunius</hi> dare to stigmatize me with being arbitrary or despotic? Has there ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver been a popular Minister in this kingdom? What is the general character of <hi>Burleigh</hi> and <hi>Walsingham?</hi> They certainly conveyed the dictates of truth to

the light of the sun, in every corner of my dominions, and I knew of no other restraint, no other attraction to my favours, but desert. The North as well as the South Briton partook equally of the warmth of my bounty. I was King of both, and was bound to treat them both as my subjects. None but a person of a narrow mind could blame me for making my benevolence general. He that would blame me for this, must blame the sun for shining upon other nations as well as his. I know indeed that some malecontents thought me partial, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause all my favours were not confined to those that were born on the south of the Tweed, and they stigmatize my generosity with the invidious terms of predilection. I looked upon myself as a common Father to all my subjects wherever disseminated. Surely it is not a crime in a father, to let all his chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren have a part in his heart. So far was I from being biassed by any error im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bibed in my education, that I divested myself of the natural predilection which every one has to the peculiar spot in which he was born, and I looked upon myself in the same light as the ancient sage; I look<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon myself not as the citizen of the world; but as if born in every district of my dominion, and bound to caress them with equal portions of affection.—The alteration made in the system of government, was the effect of deliberation, it does not become me to add, of wisdom likewise; I do not think myself obliged to reveal the secrets of government to vindicate myself from the aspersions of every one who blames my conduct. A condescention of this kind, would unhinge every part of state machinery, extirpate the very idea of subordination, and erect anarchy upon the ruins of order and govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment. It was necessary to change what would not be controuled, and despo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tism in a Minister was esteemed no less intolerable than in a Prince; it can be no crime in a Sovereign to rule<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> it would be weakness in him to suffer him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self to be ruled by a servant. I am blamed for dis<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>rding a Minister, who was at that time very popular, but sure I cannot be blamed for that step now, for even the people have divested him of the feather with which they had dressed him, and have more than once pronounced him unworthy of popu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larity.</p>
            <p>If my conduct may admit a vindication in these points, it is not less vindica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble with respect to Mr<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> Wilke<gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="1 letter">

But even in this point, I suffered royalty to stifle the agonies of the man, and bearing a public character, I would not suffer myself to be roused by less than a public injury. The laws shewed resentment to be founded upon justice; the delin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quent is now suffering no punishment from personal pique, but the punishment which he has called down upon his own head, by infringing those sanctions which are the bulwarks of civil life, and the only props of Government.— Even in the midst of punishment, I listened to the voice of mercy, and the

               </gap> any of my subjects may upon me. Ireland knows I have merited her esteem, though the daughter, she is not less caressed than the the mother. America may be considered in the same light. Neither of them would murmur from what they feel, but from what they have been taught. The complaints of either are not the complaints of distress, but the mere ecchoes of seditious demagogues. It is true they may make a noise, but the voice if articulate, is not suggested by a heart which hath felt a real pang. Not doubtful of finding many an unperverted subject in either of those regions; I am still less doubtful of my northern subjects. If Royal favours can secure fidelity, I may assure myself of theirs. When their conduct is altered from what it has been, they have a claim not only for for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveness but likewise for reward. And having already tasted the sweets of allegiance, they can have no cause for not being faithful. The army is neither my last nor my best resource. The guards deserve my protection, and being nearest my person, cannot but claim my attention. The other regiments wish to be guards, and if the guards were to be substituted in their place, they would wish to be my guards again. This is an honour which only one part of the military can enjoy, and to grieve or grow <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">

               </gap>llen on that account, would be to realize the fable of the contest between the <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>lly and its members. The marching regiments have a strong sense of the great original duty they owe their country<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> I have no cause to doubt their fidelity. To doubt, would be to deserve. Every department of the army has had all the rewards they purchased by their merits. Their eminent services have raised them to eminent posts, nor can there ever exist the same contest here as among the Romans; the Pretorian bands and the distant legions will never be at variance, and if they should be, it would not be in the power of the distant legions, nor even of the Preto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rian bands to give away the empire of Great Britain. Which way soever I look, I see no cause for perplexity or distress. I have deserved the affections of my subjects, and I will rely upon them. Our happiness is interwoven, is incorporated. God has joined them together, let no mortal therefore dare to put them asunder.—To exert prerogative to its full extent would be to procure a divorce, to exert it in a case in which I have no immediate concern, would be to forfeit what I value more than life, it would be to forfeit the confidence of future Parliaments, and even the confidence of all my subjects in general.— It is both my interest and my duty to prevent the three estates from encroach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing upon the province of each other. With what face can I then begin the encroachment, or depart from the constitutional line which terminates the sphere of my prerogative? The liberties taken with the present H— of C—, de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>serve no countenance, as they have no foundation.
