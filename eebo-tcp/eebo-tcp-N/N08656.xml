            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

            <p>HE, whoſe happineſs can admit no acceſſion, and whoſe perfect rec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude excludes every degree of malevolence, muſt deſign the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs of thoſe creatures he calls out of nothing into exiſtence; to ſuppoſe the contrary is inconſiſtent with abſolute perfection, and implies the worſt of cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racters.</p>

               <pb n="6" facs="unknown:011071_0005_0F854BB6A09ECCB0"/>
THE communication of happineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the end of creation, it will follow, from the perfections of the creator, that the whole plan of things is ſo adjuſted as to promote the benevolent purpoſe; to which the immenſe diverſity in his works; the gradation in the ſpecies of beings that we know of, and many more perhaps than we know of, and ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>what ſimilar gradation in the ſame ſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies, ariſing from their make, their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nections, and the circumſtances they are placed in, are happily ſubſervient. And every creature in the univerſe, according to its rank in the ſcale of being, is ſo conſtituted, as that acting agreeably to the laws of its nature, will promote its own happineſs, and of conſequence the grand deſign of the creator.</p>
            <p>AGREEABLY hereto, all beings in the claſs of moral agents are ſo formed, that happineſs will reſult to them from acting according to certain rules preſcribed by the creator, and made known to them by reaſon or revelation. The rules of action, conformity to which will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductive
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:011071_0006_0F854BB96BACE498"/>
of happineſs to <hi>ſuch</hi> beings, muſt be agreeable to moral fitneſs in the rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of things; in perfect conformity to which the rectitude, and happineſs of the creator himſelf conſiſts. And ſuch in the connection and dependency of things, that happineſs will reſult from conformity to theſe rules, not only to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dividuals, but likewiſe to the whole; for the beneficial effects of ſuch conformity are reciprocal.—It naturally tends to promote the order and harmony of the moral ſyſtem and ſo the general good.</p>
            <p>THE plan of the creator being thus manifeſtly adapted to promote the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his creation, his conduct herein becomes a pattern to his creatures that are rational moral agents, and the rule of their duty, according to their meaſure; for all moral obligation on ſuch, indubitably, ariſes from the will of God, as there is ſo exact a coincidence between his will, and the relative fitneſs of things; ſo that the nearer they reſemble him, the nearer they will come to the perfect ſtandard of right action, and the nearer they come
<pb n="8" facs="unknown:011071_0007_0F854BBA2425E418"/>
to <hi>this</hi> the more happineſs will be pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced.</p>
            <p>IT being ſo evidently the will of God, from the general constitution of things that the happineſs of his rational crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures ſhould be promoted, all ſuch are under moral obligation in conformity thereto, according to their ability, to promote their own, and the happineſs of others.</p>
            <p>THE nature of the hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man ſpecies, therefore, being ſo adapted to ſociety as that ſociety will afford vaſtly more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs to them, than ſolitary exiſtence could do, indicates the will of their crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tor, and makes it morally fit that they ſhould aſſociate. From the make of man, the diſadvantages of a ſolitary, and the advantages of a ſocial ſtate, evidently appear. A ſtate of ſeparation from the reſt of the ſpecies will not admit the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſe of thoſe <hi>affections and virtues,</hi> in which, from his natural conſtitution, his happineſs very much conſiſts; but in con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with others there will be oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity for the exerciſe of them. As
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:011071_0008_0F854BBAF7452F68"/>
each individual living in a ſeperate ſtate would be preventive of the happineſs for which men were evidently formed; and as this happineſs can be obtained only in a ſocial ſtate, to form into ſociety muſt be not only their intereſt, but their duty.</p>
            <p>THE inſtinct, or propenſity, implanted in the human ſpecies leading them, as it were mechanically, to <hi>that</hi> to which they are morally obliged, is an inſtance of the creator's goodneſs as it facilitates the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formance; and in the ſame proportion it does ſo, muſt make their neglect the more inexcuſable.</p>
            <p>MANKIND being formed into ſociety, the moral obligation they are under to civil government will appear from the ſame principle, as being neceſſary to ſecure to them thoſe natural rights and privileges which are eſſential to their happineſs. Life, liberty, and property, are the gifts of the creator, on the unmoleſted enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of which their happineſs chiefly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends: yet they are ſuch an imperfect ſet of beings that they are liable to have
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:011071_0009_0F854BBBB2A0FBB8"/>
theſe invaded; by one another: But the preſervation of them in every fit method is evidently their duty. The entering in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to ſociety lays the foundation of a plan for ſecuring them; but this plan will be. incomplete without the exertion of the united power of the <hi>whole</hi> for their mu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual ſafety; The exertion of this power for that purpoſe, correſpondent to the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="4 letters">
                  <desc>••••</desc>
               </gap>laſting rules of right, is what is, here, i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>ended by civil government; and as this is a method the beſt adapted, in their power, to ſecure the rights and privileges necceſſary to their happineſs, to go into it is morally fit, and evidently the will of their creator.</p>
            <p>WHATEVER mankind are oblige to perform muſt be within the verge of their power: The impracticability of the human ſpecies continuing to be one ſociety for the purpoſe before mentioned, makes it necceſſary and fit they ſhould form into diſtinct and ſeperate ſocieties, and erect civil government in them for that end.</p>
            <p>UPON the ſame principle, ſtill, the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:011071_0010_0F854BBBDFCDC4F8"/>
rights of one ſociety being in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vaded by the ſuperiour power of another, ſo long as the former are unable to aſſert their freedom, it is morally fit they ſhould receive laws from the latter <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap>ending to their happineſs, as being the beſt means in their power to promote it, rather than admit a ſtate of anarchy, big with <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion and every evil work</hi>: But from theſe circumſtances it is morally fit they ſhould reſcue themſelves whenever it is in their power, only it may be as fit to uſe cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that by ſuch attempts they do not plunge themſelves the deeper into diſtreſs.</p>
            <p>THE obligation mankind are under to civil government, in ſome form, as eſſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial to their happineſs in the preſent ſtate, and perhaps not without its influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their happineſs in a future, is not only deducible from the natural conſtitution of things, but alſo ſupported by written re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>velation; in which it is repreſented as greatly tending to their <hi>good,</hi> and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore an ordinance of the great benefactor of the world, whoſe <hi>tender mercies are ever all his works.</hi> In the epiſtle to the
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:011071_0011_0F854BBE470C3EB8"/>
Romans, the civil power is expreſsly ſaid to be <hi>of God,</hi> to be <hi>ordained</hi> of him, and the civil ruler to be <hi>the miniſter of God for good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE line, indeed, between one ſocie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and another, is not drawn by heaven; nor is the particular form of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; as whether it ſhall be conducted immediately by the whole ſociety, or by a few of their number, or if by a few, who they ſhall be, expreſsly pointed out; but, as mankind are rational and free a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gents, theſe are left to their determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and choice; only herein they are re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtricted by thoſe rules which ariſe from the moral fitneſs of things productive of the general good, which they are ever bound invariably to obſerve.</p>
            <p>NOR does the ſacred ſtory of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew</hi> polity militate againſt the eſtabliſhed order of things relative to civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among men. The theocracy of the Jews, was an extraordinary vouchſafe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of God to that particular nation, but not counter to, ordeſigned to alter, the general conſtitution of mankind.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="13" facs="unknown:011071_0012_0F854BBEE54B0710"/>
THE right the ſupreme ruler of the world has to beſtow favours upon <hi>ſome,</hi> out of the common courſe of things, while <hi>others</hi> are left in the enjoyment of their natural privileges, can, in reaſon, no more be doubted, than his right to create one being ſuperiour to another; for, though unknown to us, <hi>that,</hi> as well as <hi>this,</hi> may be in the original plan for the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation of happineſs.</p>
            <p>THE eccleſiaſtic, and civil polity of the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> nation, being under the imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diate direction of God himſelf, was not only a ſignal favor to them, but alſo de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned to anſwer very important pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes in his government of mankind.</p>
            <p>THEIR civil polity coincided with the fitneſs of ſociety, and civil government among men, in all their ſalutary effects, but the extraordinary manner, in which it was conducted, was never exhibited as a pattern to the other nations of the earth; but they were ſtill left to judge for themſelves, as to the form of civil government, within their power, that
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:011071_0013_0F854BBFA62C3398"/>
might be moſt ſubſervient to the public good.</p>
            <p>THAT this peculiar form among the Jews was not deſigned to be perpetual appears probable, from the particular di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rections early given, by <hi>Moſes</hi> the ſervant of the Lord, to regulate the adminiſtrati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of a king that ſhould, from among, themſelves, in future time, be ſet over them; and alſo by the revolution that in proceſs of time enſued by more than the divine permiſſion. After which the civil ſtate of the Jews ſymbolized with the civil ſtate of other nations.</p>
            <p>THE Deity's condeſcending to be, in a political ſenſe, king in Iſrael, being a ſignal favor to them, as hereby they had a civil government better adapted to their circumſtances, and better contrived to promote their welfare, than they could have had by all the wiſdom of man, it muſt have been impiouſly ungrateful to reject him in that character, and deſire that one of the imperfect ſons of men ſhould be their ſupreme ruler; and therefore de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:011071_0014_0F854BC071B6BEE0"/>
the ſevere reprehenſion given them, by the prophet, under the direction of God himſelf.</p>
            <p>BUT though their inadvertent and raſh deſire was ſuch an ungrateful reſignation, and juſt forfeiture of the ſpecial favor they enjoyed, that God ſaw meet to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>continue it, and to chaſtize them for their wickedneſs therein, yet he did not withdraw the protection and bleſſing of his providence from them in the exerciſe and enjoyment of the rights and privileges common to human nature. And if the alteration made at their deſire, the extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ordinary vouchſafement of the Deity apart had not been agreable to the natural con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of mankind, and fit in the relation of things, it is not eaſy to conceive how he ſhould ſo far countenance the thing as to be active in ſetting kings over them: And not only direct them in their choice, but alſo preſcribe rules for the regulation of ſuch an office, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs his approbation of, and afford his bleſſing to thoſe who formed their adminiſtration according to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="16" facs="unknown:011071_0015_0F854BC1358E3480"/>
THE difference between them, now, and the other nations ſeems chiefly to have ariſen from their religious ſtate; which indeed had ſtill ſome kindly influence up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on their civil. In the exerciſe of their natural conſtitutional rights relative to civil government, it was no doubt fit to ſeek direction from him by whoſe provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence kings reign. Their expectation of immediate direction from heaven was founded on the peculiar gracious diſpen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſation they were under; and therefore the like could not be expected by any other nation.</p>
            <p>No ſet of beings can, in reaſon, ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe themſelves wiſer than their maker; but muſt think <hi>that</hi> to which he directs to be wiſeſt and beſt; and, therefore, when they have certain notice of his plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure reſpecting any tranſaction of theirs, both duty and intereſt urge them to a compliance. And what nation of men on earth, in the exerciſe of this natural right, unalienable to any mortal, would not be glad of immediate indubitable di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rection from heaven? But when the
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:011071_0016_0F854BC2084825D0"/>
theſe ſpecial directions are not obtainable, as according to the natural conſtitution of mankind they are not, the affair being ſo important to ſociety, and the happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the whole ſo intimately connec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with it, it is fit that they ſhould firſt implore the influence of providence, which may be real, though not immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate and ſenſible; and then tranſact it in the exerciſe of that liberty wherewith the creator has made them free.</p>
            <p>EZRA's advancement to the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment over the Jews did not, indeed, ori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginate from their election, but from the civil power of that nation to which they were then in ſubjection; but yet, as their circumſtances would not admit of their exerciſing all the rights of a free ſtate, it became fit that they ſhould chearfully acquieſce in that appointment to promote their happineſs, as it was the beſt method in their power.</p>
            <p>THEY were now emerging from the loweſt ſtate of depreſſion; for ſeventy years they had been unable to break the
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:011071_0017_0F854BC2A2502630"/>
iron yoke of captivity, and to aſſert their national freedom. But under the favor of <hi>Cyrus</hi> part of the nation had returned to their own land, and were laying a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>new the foundations of <hi>the commonwealth of Iſrael.</hi> Their dependence on a foreign power, not only for permiſſion to return to the land of <hi>Paleſtine,</hi> but alſo for pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection in the re-ſettlement of it, made it evidently their duty to ſubmit to a depu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation from that power, with a view to promote their welfare.</p>
            <p>AND <hi>Ezra</hi>'s being ſent from the <hi>Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſian</hi> Court, with ample commiſſion to ſettle affairs among them, eccleſiaſtic, and civil, according to their priſtine form, was no doubt highly agreable to them, as he was of their own nation, and his qualifications were ſo adequate to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant truſt, for he was a ready ſcribe in the law of <hi>Moſes,</hi> and well under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood the magna charta of their conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; and alſo as he was a man of great piety, and virtue, and ardently diſpoſed to advance the intereſt of his nation: Who therefore could be more welcome,
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:011071_0018_0F854BC39C148D88"/>
who more likely to put things into a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per ſituation, and to promote the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of the community, the only worthy end of government?</p>
            <p>THE kind reception he met with ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears, in part, from the early application made to him reſpecting illegal marriages in vogue among them, to which, the words I have read immediately refer.—The ſtory ſhows how ready he was to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ert himſelf for their good; his known character points out his qualifications for the purpoſe; and the united efforts of the people with him, to this end, with an acknowledgement of his authority, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in the text: <hi>Ariſe, for this matter belongeth unto thee, and we will be with thee; be of good courage, and do it.</hi> And if we may be indulged to take this inſtance as a ſpecimen of <hi>Ezra</hi>'s general adminiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tration, and of the people's friendly ſpiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted aſſiſtance through the whole; and as we go along to notice his diſtinguiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed character; the way will be open to turn our attention—to the part of civil rulers—to the qualifications of ſuch—
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:011071_0019_0F854BC424F29E40"/>
and to the neceſſity of the united exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the people with their rulers, to anſwer the ſalutary purpoſes of civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment.</p>
            <p>AND FIRST, The part of civil rulers, in general is to keep in view the end of civil government, and of their own par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular advancement, and to act accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dingly.</p>
            <p>THOUGH in the conſtitution of things it does not belong to man to live alone, or without government in ſociety; yet he is inveſted with certain rights and privileges, by the bounty of the creator, ſo adapted to his nature that the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of them is the ſource of his happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in this world, and without which exiſtence here would not be deſireable. And mankind have no right voluntarily to give up to others thoſe natural privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, eſſential to their happineſs, with which they are inveſted by the Lord of all: for the improvement of <hi>theſe</hi> they are accountable to him. Nor is it fit, that
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:011071_0020_0F854BC4ED2C3D50"/>
any of the ſons of men ſhould take from others <hi>that</hi> which they have no right to give, nor by their miſconduct have for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feited; though in this caſe there ſhould be mutual conſent, the compact would be illegal, and both parties indictable at the bar of heaven.</p>
            <p>CIVIL government among mankind is not a reſignation of their natural privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leges, but that method of ſecuring them, to which they are morally obliged as conducive to their happineſs: In the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution of things, they can naturally have no rights incompatible with this; and therefore none to reſign. For each indi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidual to live in a ſeperate ſtate, and of conſequence without civil government, is ſo pregnant with evil, and greatly pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ventive of that happineſs of which human nature is made capable, that it could ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be deſigned as a privilege to man by the munificent creator: And, perhaps, is not a privilege to other orders of ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional creatures, as much ſuperior to man, in virtue, as in rank of being.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="22" facs="unknown:011071_0021_0F854BC5D4B2BC90"/>
MANKIND may naturally have a li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty to live without civil government in the ſame ſenſe that they have a liberty, <hi>i.e.</hi> a power to neglect any moral duty: But they are evidently made dependent on one another for happineſs; and that method of action, which in the conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of things, will prevent miſery, and procure happineſs to the ſpecies, on ſuppoſition of their being acquainted with it, and in a capacity of going into it, is not only wrong in them to neglect, but even duty indiſpenſible to purſue. From hence ariſes their obligation to civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment as mentioned before; and when the ſame reaſon urges the lodging this government in the hands of a few of the number aſſociated, the ſame obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion lies on them to do ſo.</p>
            <p>A COMMUNITY having determined that to commit the power of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſome few of their number is beſt, the right the ſome few can have to it, muſt ariſe from the choice of the whole; for in this ſtate the government belongs to the whole, and one has no more right
<pb n="23" facs="unknown:011071_0022_0F854BC6881411C8"/>
to govern than another; the right there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore that individuals can have to this muſt be delegated. This delegation is not in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed the giving away of the right the whole have to govern, but providing for the exerciſe of their power in the moſt effectual manner.</p>
            <p>IT is by virtue of the previous conſent of ſociety as being beſt, that government may devolve on ſome by ſucceſſion, and that others may be appointed to rule by thooſe already in authority.</p>
            <p>A COMPACT for civil government in any community implies the ſtipulation of certain rules of government. Theſe rules or laws more properly make the ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil conſtitution. How various theſe rules are in different nations is not the preſent enquiry; but that they ought in every nation to coincide with the moral fitneſs of things, by which alone the natural rights of mankind can be ſecured, and their happineſs promoted, is very certain. And ſuch are the laws of the conſtitution of civil government that we, and all
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:011071_0023_0F854BC735D72078"/>
               <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubjects are ſo happy as to live under.</p>
            <p>THE rectitude of the laws of a civil conſtitution are of more importance to the well-being of ſociety than the parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular form of adminiſtration, but that form which is beſt adapted to ſecure the uninterrupted courſe of ſuch laws is moſt eligible, and herein alſo we outvie other nations.</p>
            <p>THOSE laws which preſcribe the rights of prerogative, and the rights of the people, ſhould be founded on ſuch prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as tend to promote the great end of civil inſtitution; and as they are to be held ſacred by both, it may be ſuppoſed, ought to be as plain as the nature of the thing will admit: Myſteries in civil go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment relative to the rights of the people, like myſteries in the laws of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, may be pretended, and to the like purpoſe of ſlavery, <hi>this</hi> of the ſouls, and <hi>that</hi> of the bodies of men.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="25" facs="unknown:011071_0024_0F854BC7E89FFE70"/>
THE deſign of mankind in forming a civil conſtitution being to ſecure their natural rights and privileges, and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mote their happineſs, it is neceſſary that the ſpecial end of the electors in chuſing ſome to govern the whole, ſhould be aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to by the elected to veſt them with a right to govern, ſo far at leaſt as to direct the adminiſtration, without which they are indeed veſted with no authority; for the being choſen to a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular purpoſe by thoſe in whom the right of choice is, can give no rightful power to act beſide or counter to this purpoſe. And therefore to the proper inveſtiture of any in the office of civil rulers to which they are choſen by the people, it is neceſſary they ſhould con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent to act the part for which they are choſen; and this ſets them in the high office of government, and gives them authority to regulate the whole.</p>
            <p>THEIR conſent to take the office to which they are choſen by the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty lays rulers under a moral obligation to diſcharge the duties of it with fidelity.
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:011071_0025_0F854BC8D08B9498"/>
And if for the greater ſecurity of ſociety, they who are thus introduced into office are bound to the faithful diſcharge of it by the ſolemnity of an oath, their obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion hereto is the greater.</p>
            <p>WHAT is right in the relation of things, and which has the general conſent of mankind, being the rule of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in a well conſtituted ſtate, civil rulers are to be ſo far from invading, that they ought to be the guardians of the natural and conſtitutional rights of their ſubjects; which are here ſuppoſed to be ſo nearly the ſame that there is no interfering between them. To form a civil conſtitution otherwiſe would be to eſtabliſh iniquity by law.</p>
            <p>THE various duties of their office then centre in one point, the end of their elec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and that is to promote the public welfare.</p>
            <p>MINUTELY to enumerate theſe duties is no indeed pretended, not only as it would take up too much time, but
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:011071_0026_0F854BC961248AF8"/>
alſo as the wiſdom of the politician can better apply general rules to particular caſes as cimcumſtances vary; I therefore ſhall take the liberty only in a more ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral way to obſerve: That whatever is injurious to the community, whether foreign or inteſtine, is theirs to endeavor to prevent. In this ſtate of imperfection and ſin, particular ſocieties are liable to injuries from one another, hence vigilance becomes one part of the duty of civil rulers; to this they are more obliged than other men: In office they are as eyes to the political body, the proper uſe of which is neceſſary to its ſafety. It is no ſmall part of their care to deſery danger, to pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netrate the deſigns formed abroad to the detriment of the community. And as
they are ſet for the public defence, when ſuch dangers are diſcovered by them, it is their part to provide againſt them at the public expence; which muſt be in their power at all times, or at ſome times it may not be in their power to act in the character of guardians to the public. Individuals of the ſame ſociety are like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe liable to unequal treatment from one
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:011071_0027_0F854BCA2A5A6840"/>
another, which alſo claims their attention. They are to reſcue the weak and helpleſs, the widow and fatherleſs, from the cruel hands of oppreſſion, and equally ſecure to all, high and low, their rights.</p>
            <p>AND whatever is for the advantage and emolument of ſociety, is alſo their part to promote, not only barely to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure to their ſubjects the cardinal privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges of human nature, but alſo kindly en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deavour to heighten their happineſs in the enjoyment of them. Thoſe methods which will be moſt conducive to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>servation and proſperity of the <hi>whole</hi> are to be ſtudiouſly deviſed, and faithfully urged by them; hence agriculture and commerce, liberal and mechanical arts ſhould be encouraged, as pointed out in providence for the benefit of mankind; in proportion to improvement in which will be the benefit reſulting from them, by which a ſupply may be obtained not only for neceſſity, but alſo for delight; and hereby their political ſtrength will be increaſed, and they become more able to ſupport the common cauſe. The wealth
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:011071_0028_0F854BCAECD0CF10"/>
of the people is the ſtrength of the ſtate; and therefore, as <hi>the diligent hand maketh rich,</hi> they ſhould reduce the vagrant, and call the idle to labor, and all to induſtry in their reſpective callings, ſo eſſential to the public utility.</p>
            <p>BUT <hi>wiſdom is a defence</hi> as well as <hi>money,</hi> and neceſſary to the well being of a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity. The education of the youth is therefore carefully to be provided for; that hereby ſuch improvements may be made, as happily tend to abate the fero<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>city of uncultivated nature, to ſoften the temper, and give a high reliſh to the ſweets of ſocial life; and ſuch geniuſes may be formed as public offices require; that the <hi>people,</hi> in church, or ſtate, may not be <hi>deſtroyed for lack of knowledge;</hi> but <hi>wiſdom and knowledge</hi> may <hi>be the ſtability of the times.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE civil power alſo ſhould be exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted to ſuppreſs vice as pregnant with miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief to ſociety; and to ſupport virtue as the foundation of ſocial happineſs.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="30" facs="unknown:011071_0029_0F854BCBA3E42028"/>
THAT public homage which the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>munity owe to the great Lord of all; and which is equally their intereſt as their duty to pay, ſhould be earneſtly promo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by their rulers. The fitneſs of which reaſon dictates and revelation confirms, as a proper expreſſion of the dependence of mankind on him, and of their grateful ſentiments towards him, <hi>who giveth to all life and breath and all things</hi>; and alſo as the way more deeply to impreſs on their minds a ſenſe of their obligations to conform to his will; conformity to which will produce order and harmony, and qualify for the bleſſings of his providence.</p>
            <p>THE great advantages acruing from the public ſocial worſhip of the Deity may be a laudable motive to civil rulers to exert themſelves to promote it; and will have an influence on them who have the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic good at heart, as well as a proper ſenſe of duty to him, who <hi>is higher than the higheſt</hi>: In this way, while the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of religion are under the patronage of the civil power, the people will be in ſtructed in thoſe principles, and urged to
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:011071_0030_0F854BCC60CC5108"/>
thoſe practices, which will greatly ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve the intereſt of the community, and facilitate the end of government.</p>
            <p>EZRA'S commiſſion extended to church as well as ſtate; and there is indeed ſuch a connection between them, and their intereſt is ſo dependent upon each other, that the welfare of the community ariſes from things going <hi>well</hi> in both; and therefore both, though with ſuch reſtric<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions as their reſpective nature requires, claim the attention and care of the civil rulers of a people, whoſe duty it is to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect, and foſter their ſubjects in the enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of their religious rights and privile<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, as well as civil, and upon the ſame principle of promoting their happineſs.</p>
            <p>IT is therefore the part of civil rulers to make, and as occaſion ſhall offer, to execute ſuch laws as tend to promote the public welfare. <hi>Theſe</hi> indeed are in ſome meaſure to be varied, according to the temper and circumſtances of the ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, by the wiſdom of the legiſlators; but yet it is neceſſary there ſhould be in them
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:011071_0031_0F854BCD224C0398"/>
a conformity to the immutable laws of nature, to anſwer the true deſign of civil inſtitution.</p>
            <p>To theſe laws it is fit they ſhould add ſuch ſanctions as will give them energy if they are ſuitably applied by thoſe in civil office whoſe part it is to put the laws into execution.</p>
            <p>PROVIDED always, that no laws be made invaſive of the natural rights of conſcience, and no penalties inflicted by the civil power in things purely religious, and which do not affect the well being of the ſtate: In <hi>theſe,</hi> every man has an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alienable right, in the conſtitution of things, to judge for himſelf: No man, and no number of men therefore have a right to aſſume juriſdiction here.</p>
            <p>ON the free exerciſe of their natural religious rights the preſent as well as fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture happineſs of mankind greatly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends; the abridgement of which by pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal laws is evidently incongruous to the eternal rules of equity; but theſe rules
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:011071_0032_0F854BCDE0D77498"/>
are never to be violated in the exerciſe of civil power. Civil laws, of right, can relate only to thoſe actions which have influence on the welfare of the ſtate; and to all <hi>ſuch</hi> the ſubject may be urged by the civil authority conſiſtently with that freedom of mind, in judging of points of ſpeculation, and that liberty of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience relative to modes of worſhip, which he has a natural right unmoleſted to enjoy.</p>
            <p>OBLIGATION on civil rulers to ſecure the rights and promote the happineſs of the people, moſt certainly implies a power in them to that purpoſe, —to make laws and execute them; without which, ruler is but an empty name: To this purpoſe they are indeed cloathed with authority, and armed with the united power of the community; only in the exerciſe of this power they are under the ſame moral re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrictions with thoſe by whom it was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>legated to them.</p>
            <p>As in a well conſtituted civil ſtate there is a ſubordination among rulers, and each has his reſpective part to act
<pb n="34" facs="unknown:011071_0033_0F854BD011BA5868"/>
with a view to the public good; ſo to carry the grand deſign into execution it is neceſſary that each ſhould keep the line of his own particular departments every excentric motion will introduce diſorder and be productive of miſchief: But each keeping a ſteady and regular courſe in his own ſphere, will diſpenſe a benign influ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence upon the community, and harmo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niouſly conſpire to promote the general good: As in the ſolar ſyſtem, every pla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>net revolving in its own orbit round the ſun produces that order and harmony which ſecures the conſervation of the whole.</p>
            <p>THE part that civil rulers have to act ſuppoſes qualifications for that purpoſe, and accordingly we have begged leave in the SECOND place, from the diſtin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guiſhed character of <hi>Ezra</hi> to ſuggeſt ſome of them.</p>
            <p>RELIGION, learning, and firmneſs of mind in the diſcharge of the duties of his office, were conſpicuous parts of his cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter, and comprehend perhaps moſt of the qualifications requiſite in civil rulers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="35" facs="unknown:011071_0034_0F854BD02FAC5C68"/>
RELIGION includes piety and virtue, and is acting agreeable to the will of God according to the capacity of the moral agent. To <hi>this</hi> all men are under obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion as they would anſwer the end of their creation, and qualify themſelves for the happineſs for which they were for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med: And to <hi>this</hi> they are obliged in their ſocial connections, that the happy effects of it may be felt not only by them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves but alſo by others. Nor is there any ſtation among mankind ſo elevated as to free from this obligation.</p>
            <p>THE public good is in proportion to right action in every individual.—But as in the civil ſubordination among men <hi>ſome</hi> have it in their power to do more <hi>good</hi> or <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chief</hi> to the <hi>whole</hi> than others, ſo it is of more importance to ſociety that ſuch ſhould be virtuous than others. There is an eſſential difference between virtue and vice, and their different conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces to ſociety will be ſenſibly felt: nor is it in the power of earth, or hell, to alter the natural conſtitution of things.</p>
            <p>VICE is detrimental to ſociety in ſome
<pb n="36" facs="unknown:011071_0035_0F854BD0E27CA4D0"/>
degree in <hi>any</hi> of its members, but is more ſo in <hi>thoſe</hi> who manage the public af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs of it. It diſqualifies for public ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vices at the ſame rate, as it debaſes the mind, weakens the generous movements of the ſoul, and centres it's views in the contracted circle of ſelf-intereſt.</p>
            <p>BUT virtue qualifies for public offices as it dilates the mind with liberal ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, inſpires with principles of benefi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cent actions, and diſpoſes to a ready com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliance with the apoſtolic injunction, <hi>look not every man on his own things, but every man alſo on the things of another.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE religion of Jeſus is deſigned to <hi>deſtroy the works of the devil,</hi> to bring men <hi>from darkneſs to light,</hi> from error to the truth, <hi>and from the power of ſatan unto God</hi>—It inſpires the mind with a ſacred regard to God, and with benevolence to men,— it is an imitation of his example, <hi>who came down from heaven</hi> and <hi>went about doing good,</hi>—of <hi>his, who is good to all,</hi> and <hi>whoſe mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy endures forever</hi>—and it alſo more power<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully inforces all moral obligations, as it illucidates a future ſtate of rewards and puniſhments.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="37" facs="unknown:011071_0036_0F854BD34AEDE5B8"/>
THAT character therefore which is formed from thoſe principles, which are abhorrent to ſiniſter views, and indirect meaſures to promote a man's own private intereſt, and lead to generous godlike ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions diffuſive of goodneſs to mankind, and which afford the ſtrongeſt motives to ſuch actions, evidently correſponds to a public ſtation, and is moſt likely, <hi>ceteris paribus,</hi> to discharge with fidelity the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a civil poſt.</p>
            <p>NOR is the influence, the example of rulers will, in high probility, have upon others, unimportant to ſociety: Facts de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monſtrate examples to be very forcible on human nature. Inferiours eſpecially are apt to copy the pattern ſet them by ſuperiours, and too often even to ſervile imitation. In ſome proportion then as the example of thoſe who are in exalted ſtations is virtuous or vicious it may natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally be expected the character of the <hi>whole</hi> will be: Nor is ſacred hiſtory ſilent as to the influence public charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters have had upon the morals of a peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple; in this view therefore it is the wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom and intereſt of a community to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:011071_0037_0F854BD3E4C6BBE0"/>
the virtuous to the vicious for their rulers.</p>
            <p>BUT the goodneſs of the heart influen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tial on the life, without diſcernment in the heart, will yet leave civil rulers ſhort of a qualification neceſſary to diſcharge the duties of their office. Men may be pious and virtuous and yet not capable of pene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trating very far into the nature and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection of things, and therefore unequal to tranſactions which require more than common abilites.</p>
            <p>THE natural and acquired accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of mankind are various, all an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwering good purpoſes in their reſpective ſituations, and ſubſervient to the general good; and in proportion to <hi>theſe</hi> they are qualified for different employments. Of <hi>Ezra's learning</hi> particular notice is taken in his commiſſion for <hi>government,</hi> as qualifying him for the important poſt. And ſomething correſponding hereto in all civil rulers is undoubtedly requiſite in their ſeveral departments; I mean a ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity of diſcerning the nature and duties of their office, and how to perform them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="39" facs="unknown:011071_0038_0F854BD4B4218CF0"/>
It is not Indeed of ſo much importance how they come by their qualifications, whether by <hi>leſs</hi> or <hi>greater</hi> application, as that they are really poſſeſſed of it; on <hi>this</hi> in no ſmall degree the welfare of ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciety depends. Thoſe poſts, to perform the duties of which diſtinguiſhing abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, clearneſs of underſtanding and ſound<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of judgement are required, cannot be filled to advantage by <hi>thoſe</hi> in whom <hi>theſe</hi> are wanting; <hi>if the blind lead the blind both will fall into the ditch.</hi> In this fluctuating uncertain ſtate, the communi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty will, at particular ſeaſons more eſpeci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally, need <hi>wiſe men</hi> for <hi>pilots,</hi> to ſave the threatned bark from ſurrounding gaping ruin. The weighty and multifarious con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerns of ſtate require <hi>great</hi> and <hi>extenſive</hi> abilities to ſtear the <hi>whole</hi> in that chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nel which will terminate in the public ſecurity and emolument.</p>
            <p>CAPACITY for poſts of public truſt without virtuous principles is indeed pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>carious, and not ſafely to be depended on; but when probity and wiſdom unite in the ſame perſon they form a character that tends greatly to ſupport the confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence,
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:011071_0039_0F854BD5634E25A0"/>
and ſecure the happineſs of the people.</p>
            <p>BUT to <hi>theſe</hi> we may yet add firmneſs of mind in the execution of their office as a very neceſſary qualification in civil rulers, without <hi>which</hi> an habitual diſposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to do their duty, and the good ſenſe to underſtand it, may not in all circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances anſwer the end. The neceſſity of <hi>this</hi> is ſuppoſed by <hi>Shechaniah</hi> when he ſays to <hi>Ezra</hi> in the text, <hi>be of good courage, and do it.</hi> And was exemplified by <hi>that ruler</hi> in his administration.</p>
            <p>THE preſent ſtate of things will afford frequent occaſions of trying the virtue as well as the wiſdom of rulers.—Like o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men they are expoſed to temptations, and perhaps to more and greater than o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers; and human nature at beſt is very imperfect. The temper of domination ſo ſtrongly interwoven in the make of man may induce them to a wanton exerciſe of the power repoſed in them. Flattery by its ſoothing addreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes and artful inſinuations may inſenſibly divert them from a right courſe, and lead
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:011071_0040_0F854BD634E6B1B0"/>
them to diſpenſe the bleſſings of govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with a partial hand. Calumny and cruel cenſure may provoke in them too great reſentment, or ſubject them to that <hi>fear of man</hi> which <hi>bringeth a ſnare</hi>: Firm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of mind is therefore neceſſary to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel <hi>theſe</hi> and a thouſand other temptations—to ſupreſs every undue ſally of the ſoul, and to urge the ſpring of action, that they may purſue with ſteadineſs and vigor the great end of their office.</p>
            <p>THOSE noble exertions of mind which a due adminiſtration requires clearly evinces the neceſſity of this temper in ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil rulers: As in order hereto the art of ſelf-denial muſt be learned and frequent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly practiſed by them;—a prevailing attach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to their own private intereſts and gratifications be given up to the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic—angry reſentments be tempered down to the ſtandard of right action, —their eaſe ſuperſeded by inceſſant labors, and ſacrificed to the benefit of others.</p>
            <p>SOFTNESS and timidity of mind indul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged into habit will weaken reſolution, and relax the nerves of effort in the moſt
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:011071_0041_0F854BD6E37A3EB0"/>
trying ſeaſons, and perhaps betray the cauſe their office calls, and their virtue inclines them to ſupport. But firmneſs and fortitude of ſoul ariſing from princi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, and cultivated with care, will not eaſily admit thoſe fordid views that lead <hi>ſupinley</hi> to neglect, or <hi>tamely</hi> to ſurrender the intereſt of ſociety, but enable them to comport with perſonal inconveniences, and ſtand firm amidſt the ſevereſt trials, in executing the duties of their office.</p>
            <p>GOOD may indeed be done by him, who is <hi>diſtinguiſhed</hi> by one of theſe quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fications alone, and more eſpecially in his connections with others employed in, the ſame office; their different qualities may operate in ſubſerviency to each other, and by their mutual aid lead into mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures conducive to the general ſafety; and happy to mankind that in this imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect ſtate it is ſo! But without determin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which of them being wanting in civil rulers would be of moſt dangerous con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequence to ſociety, it is very certain their meeting in the ſame perſon forms a character that will beſt anſwer the deſign of ſuch promotion; and the more there
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:011071_0042_0F854BD7BA7D8A90"/>
are of this character among them, the more likely it is that the public welfare will be promoted.</p>
            <p>BUT, if every good quality ſhould Meet in civil rulers yet THIRDLY, the united exertions of the people with them are neceſſary to anſwer the ſalutary pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes of civil government.</p>
            <p>A COMMUNITY 'having delegated to ſome of their number the power of civil government as a method of exerciſing that power the beſt adapted to ſecure their natural rights and promote their happineſs are not at liberty to counteract the me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thod, but under obligation, in every fit way, to ſupport it; and indeed without their exerting themſelves to this purpoſe, their rulers, however well qualified, will be unable to anſwer the end of their ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vancement.</p>
            <p>THE cauſe in which rulers and ruled are engaged is the ſame, though the parts they have to act are different; <hi>theſe</hi> all tend to one grand point, the welfare of
<pb n="44" facs="unknown:011071_0043_0F854BD8695B8A28"/>
the community; and people are as much obliged to fidelity and ardor in the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of their duty, as rulers to theirs, in ſupporting the common cauſe.</p>
            <p>THE diſcharge of the duties of civil office merits an adequate reward from them, whoſe buſineſs is done thereby; and the community are unqueſtionably obliged to ſee that buſineſs performed. Rulers devoting their time and their ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lents to the ſervice of the public entitles them to an eaſy and honourable ſupport: For real ſervice and great benefit done them, it is the duty of the <hi>people</hi> to <hi>render to all their dues, tribute to whom tribute is due,</hi> and <hi>cuſtom to whom cuſtom.</hi> If <hi>this</hi> ſhould not be afforded <hi>them</hi> by the public, they could not attend <hi>continually</hi> upon the duties of their ſtation, and of conſequence civil government, on which ſo much de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends, could not be upheld to advantage.</p>
            <p>A RESPECTFUL treatment of their rulers is alſo due from the people, and greatly conducive to the end of civil in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitution. <hi>They</hi> are raiſed to exalted ſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion by the <hi>people,</hi> under the govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:011071_0044_0F854BD92C5E8540"/>
of his providence, who wills the happineſs of <hi>all men,</hi> and in promoting which they are to be conſidered as his vicegerents executing his will, and therefore worthy of eſteem and venerati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. Their ſucceſs in adminiſtration alſo very much depends upon this reſpectful deportment toward them: To pour con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempt upon rulers is to weaken government itſelf, and to weaken government is to ſow the feeds of libertiniſm, which in a ſoil ſo prolific as human nature, will ſoon ſpring up into a luxuriant growth; nor will it be in the power of rulers to ſtop the growing miſchief, or, to keep things in a proper ſituation, without, the concurring aid of the people.</p>
            <p>A SACRED regard to civil authority, according to the true deſign of it, is to be cultivated in all; and as a means na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turally tending to this, including the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of divine influence in their ard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uous, and benevolent work, it is directed by the ſupreme law-giver, <hi>that ſupplica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, and prayers, interceſſions, and giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of thanks be made—for kings, and for all that an in authority, that we may lead a
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:011071_0045_0F854BD9EA484B88"/>
quiet and peaceable life in all godlineſs and honeſty.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To keep up veneration for rulers, is to keep up a regard to government itſelf in the community, and to open the way for its happier influence. Honor there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſhould be rendered to them to whom it is due for the good ſervices they have already done, and as being the way to give them opportunity of doing more, and to ſtimulate them to improve the opportunity by the vigorous exertions of their abilities to that purpoſe.</p>
            <p>BUT ſtill and more eſpecially, the uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted efforts of the people with their ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers are neceſſary to the putting thoſe laws into execution that are made for the good of the community.</p>
            <p>IT is here ſuppoſed, that the laws made by civil rulers coincide with moral fitneſs, and are calculated to anſwer the end for which only they are impowered to make laws; if otherwiſe, the ſubject can be under no obligation to obſerve them; but may be morally obliged to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſt
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:011071_0046_0F854BDAB5CD4CD8"/>
them, as it muſt ever be right <hi>to obey God rather than men.</hi> The doctrine of <hi>paſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive obedience</hi> and <hi>non-reſiſtence</hi> in the unli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mited ſenſe it has been urged by ſome, came not down from above, as it can be ſupported neither by reaſon nor revela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and therefore if any where, may be urged with a better grace by <hi>the rulers of darkneſs,</hi> in the regions below, upon thoſe who by the righteous decree of heaven, are excluded the common benefits of cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation, than by thoſe <hi>powers that are or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dained of God</hi> for the <hi>good</hi> of mankind. But though with the higheſt propriety this doctrine may be exploded, it does not at all leſſen the moral obligation of obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence in the people to an equitable admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtration; and to uſe their endeavours that the laws made by their rulers to promote the good of the community ſhould take place to that purpoſe: This is only the continued exertion of that power which is neceſſary to carry into effect the plan of civil government laid by themſelves, and without which the beſt laws will fall ſhort of it. There may be <hi>good</hi> laws, and <hi>faithful</hi> executors of them, and yet ſuch a practical combination of the ſubjects as in
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:011071_0047_0F854BDB635FA618"/>
ſome meaſure fruſtrate the happy effects of them: The violation of <hi>theſe</hi> laws may be ſo connived at in one another, as to prevent the executors having the oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity to ſuppreſs them. The laws of the ſupreme legiſlator of the world are un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtionably <hi>juſt and good,</hi> and yet are tranſgreſſed by daring mortals every day: And though under his all-diſcerning eye the impenitent ſhall not finally eſcape with impunity, yet the tranſgreſſors of human laws founded on the ſame prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples as the divine, may illude the inſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of man and the force of his laws: And when this practice ſhall become ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral in civil ſociety, the energy of go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment will of courſe be relaxed. Nor can it be in the power of rulers the beſt qualified and the moſt ſedulouſly atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive to the duties of their office to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent it, unleſs they were gods in a high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er ſenſe than the ſcripture intends by giving them that title, and were able not only to make <hi>good</hi> laws, but alſo to inſpire their ſubjects with a principle of obedience to them.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="49" facs="unknown:011071_0048_0F854BDC4776CC10"/>
IT is therefore plain, that the united efforts of the people are neceſſary to ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port civil government, and make it effi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cacious to the great and happy end for which it was inſtituted: And as rulers are holden by the ſtrongeſt ties to conſult and endeavour the welfare of the people; the <hi>people</hi> are equally bound to aid and aſſiſt them in theſe endeavours.</p>
            <p>WHAT has been imperfectly ſuggeſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted in this diſcourſe may lead to, ſome re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections on the goodneſs of the ſupreme ruler of the world, to mankind in general and to ourſelves in particular, in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent ſtate, more eſpecially as expreſſed in the inſtitution of civil government: And give occaſion to urge the attention of ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers and people to the duties of their reſpective ſtations.</p>
            <p>THE goodneſs of the Creator appears through all his works, but more illuſtri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly to man than to any other creature on this earth; him he hath ſet at the head of this part of his creation: The place of his preſent abode is accomoda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="50" facs="unknown:011071_0049_0F854BDCE708FF08"/>
to his neceſſity and pleaſure; and his mind is endowed with reaſon and underſtanding to guide and regulate him in the enjoyment. With a view to ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cure him in the poſſeſſion of the munifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cence of his creator, he is directed by in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct and reaſon to aſſociate, and amica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bly unite the ſtrength of individuals for the defence and ſafety of the whole.</p>
            <p>AND this method is peculiarly adapted to the preſent depraved ſtate of mankind, in which by leaping the mounds of right man is the greateſt enemy to man. If there was no ſuch thing as civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among them, what ravages! and what depredations would there be! This earth would be the habitation of cruelty, and a field of blood. The conſequences of perfect anarchy among mankind would be more unhappy and miſchievous to them, than if <hi>the foundations of the earth</hi> were <hi>out of courſe, the ſun</hi> ſhould <hi>be darkened, and the moon not give her light, and the ſtars fall from heaven;</hi> And the natural order of this ſyſtem ſhould be interrupted by a general and moſt ruinous confuſion.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="51" facs="unknown:011071_0050_0F854BDDA520E200"/>
BUT the plan of civil government, as included in the conſtitution of things, and obvious to the common ſenſe of mankind, well executed by them, gives ſuch a check to <hi>evil doers,</hi> and ſupport to <hi>them that do well,</hi> that the nearer man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind purſue it, in its true intention, the more this earth will become a habitation of peace, of ſecurity and happineſs. This privilege is put into their hands by the Lord of all, as the great ſecurity and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletion of their earthly felicity; to him therefore their united acknowledgements ſhould like incenſe, with fervor aſcend.</p>
            <p>WE ourſelves have reaſon, not only to join in the univerſal tribute, as partaking of the bleſſings of the creator in common with mankind, but alſo in particular to expreſs our warmeſt gratitude to him whoſe providence determines <hi>the bounds</hi> of <hi>the habitations of all the nations of men that dwell on the fact of the earth</hi>; that we live under a conſtitution of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the beſt adapted to ſecure the rights and liberties of the ſubject: The funda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental laws of which are agreable to the laws of nature reſulting from the relation
<pb n="52" facs="unknown:011071_0051_0F854BDE78CAF4A8"/>
of things, worthy of men and chriſtians; and the form of adminiſtration the beſt contrived to ſecure a ſteady adherence to thoſe laws in the exerciſe of civil power. Our King ſways the ſceptre in righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, <hi>and his throne is upholden by mercy</hi>: The legiſlative and executive powers are guided by the ſame laws.</p>
            <p>THE beneficial effects of the happy constitution extend to the remoteſt parts of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire: <hi>Britons</hi> exult in the enjoyment of their natural rights un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der its auſpicious influence, nor leſs the coloniſts in <hi>North-America</hi> while they participate with grateful and loyal hearts the like bleſſings from the ſame ſource.</p>
            <p>THE coloniſts indeed on account of local circumſtances, have been indulged to form into little diſtinct ſtates under the ſame head, and to make laws and exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute them, reſtricted at the ſame time by the laws and dependent on the ſupreme power of the nation as far as it is conſiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tent with the eſſential rights of <hi>Britiſh</hi> ſubjects and neceſſary to the well-being of the whole. And this is ſo far from being
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:011071_0052_0F854BDF2D6C6EE8"/>
the ground of their complaint that it is in their opinion the very foundation of their happineſs; from the antient ſtock they delight to draw nutrition as hereby they flouriſh, and in their turn bear to <hi>that</hi> proportionable fruit. Nor could any thing more ſenſibly affect them, or be thought of with more regret, than to be reſcinded from the body of the empire, and their preſent connections with <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>IN their little depedent ſtates they have long enjoyed her parental ſmiles, which has greatly increaſed their attachment to her: The relief ſhe has kindly afforded them in times of danger and diſtreſs will always invigorate the addreſſes, and ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port the confidence of her children to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her, under the like circumſtances, till they ſhall find themſelves diſcarded by her. Which ſad cataſtrophe may all-gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious Heaven prevent! But the ſame pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tronage is ſtill to be hoped for by the coloniſts while they do nothing to forfeit it. Nor is it to be thought that <hi>Great-Britain</hi> would deſignedly enſlave any of her free-born ſons, and thereby break in
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:011071_0053_0F854BDFF4D091A0"/>
upon that conſtitution ſo friendly to liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and on which her own ſafety depends.</p>
            <p>THIS Province has not the leaſt ſhare in privileges derived from the civil conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution of her parent country, and which are amply ſecured to us by royal charter.</p>
            <p>OUR Governor is by deputation from our moſt gracious Sovereign as the repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſentative of his ſacred perſon in our pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vincial model of civil government. His Majeſty's paternal care in this reſpect is moſt readily acknowledged by us, as the Gentleman who has this honor at preſent is well acquainted with the laws and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>malities of our civil conſtitution, and has abilities equal to the important poſt. Whoſe preſence forbids every thing that looks like adulation, but may admit of the warmeſt wiſhes for his happineſs in this world and the next.</p>
            <p>THE other two branches of the legiſla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture are choſen by the people, either im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediately by themſelves or mediately by their repreſentatives, which coincides with the freedom of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> conſtitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:011071_0054_0F854BE0A1B91650"/>
and we ſhall always eſteem as a pledge of the Royal favor.</p>
            <p>THE return of <hi>this day</hi> is auſpicious to our civil liberties, and fills every honeſt heart with joy. The liberty of chuſing men from among ourſelves, whoſe intereſt is inſeperably connected with the <hi>whole,</hi> for his Majeſty's Council in the province, whoſe part is not only to aid the power of legislation, but alſo "freely to give advice at all times to the Governor for the good management of the public affairs of government," will always be conſidered as a privilege <hi>dear</hi> and <hi>ſacred</hi> by all who are not, by blind prejudice or fordid views, loſt to a ſenſe of the ineſtimable value of their natural and conſtitutional freedom.</p>
            <p>THE election of ſo important a branch of the legiſlature will naturally gain the attention of thoſe who are concerned in it. Fidelity in the diſcharge of the truſt repo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed in them, and a regard to the welfare of the province will determine their choice. All perſonal piques, and perſonal friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhips, and private intereſts will be laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſide upon this intereſting occaſion. And
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:011071_0055_0F854BE160EC5C28"/>
while the public good is kept in view, qualifications for a place of ſo much weight and influence in government will be chiefly regarded.</p>
            <p>WE reſt aſſured in the good opinion we have of the Electors, that they will diveſt their minds of every wrong <hi>byaſs,</hi> and will not <hi>take</hi> thoſe who neither <hi>fear God, nor regard man</hi>; who have no ſteady principles of action to be depended upon, unleſs thoſe that lead them to break through the the higheſt moral obligation, and to live as <hi>without God in the world</hi>: and in whoſe minds private intereſt evidently turns the balance againſt the public. Not thoſe who are unfriendly to learning, who at the moſt have only taken the intoxica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting draught at the <hi>pierian</hi> ſpring, but have not drank ſo deep as to open their eyes and give them a juſt diſcernment of things, who in their patriotic phrenzy would deprive church and ſtate of the the means greatly conducive to the well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>being of <hi>both.</hi> Nor yet the puſhlanimous who would not dare to ſpeak their minds in their Country's cauſe in trying ſeaſons, and are only fit for a private ſtation.</p>

               <hi>THEIR</hi> virtue and wiſdom will for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tify them againſt artful addreſſes and wily intreagues in this important tranſaction. A juſt concern for the intereſt of their country will lead them to prefer thoſe qualities and accomplishments which are moſt likely to promote it, and to give their ſuffrages for men evidently poſſeſſed of them to ſit at the Council-Board the enſuing year.</p>
            <p>AND may all, who by the people un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der God are advanced to poſts of civil power and truſt, attend to the true de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign of their advancement, and with fide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity and inceſſant ardor purſue it.</p>
            <p>The <hi>matter</hi> which <hi>belongeth</hi> unto them being altogether intereſting to us, as eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry thing dear in this world is connected with it, we ſurely may be allowed to hope for an <hi>upright</hi> and <hi>wiſe</hi> management of it, and as the taſk is arduous, and at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended with various and great trials, to preſs them by every conſideration to <hi>be of good courage, and do it.</hi>

efforts are wanting.—The neglect of their duty, or that which is worſe the counteracting the grand deſign of their office, by indirect methods, they will be able to anſwer, neither to their country, to their own conſcience, nor <hi>to God the judge of all</hi>; for not only the preſent, but future generations alſo, will feel the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happy conſequences, and execrate the authors of what they feel. Their conſciences will give them trouble at certain periods, but eſpecially at the near ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proach of the deciſive day, when all their dignity will forſake them, and they will appear in their real worthleſs character, and creep <hi>into the holes of the rocks, and caves of the earth for fear of the Lord,</hi> to ſhelter themſelves from that vengeance which yet will inevitably light on their devoted heads. On the other hand, the diligent, the faithful and intrepid exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of the duties of their office, will make them benefactors to the people at preſent, and tranſmit their names with honor to poſterity, who, in futurity, will participate the bleſſings. And <hi>ſuch</hi> conduct will afford to their mind a ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction that nothing can equal ſhort of
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:011071_0058_0F854BE3AAD1FD88"/>
the plaudit of their judge; who Will not forget their <hi>labor of love,</hi> but amply reward their ſervices for mankind, and as they have <hi>been faithful over a few things</hi> he <hi>will make them rulers over many things.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THE happineſs of THIS PEOPLE in the enjoyment of their natural rights and privileges under providence is provided for by their being a part of <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire, by which they are intitled to all the privileges of that happy conſtitution; and alſo by the full and ample recogni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of theſe privileges to them by char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>acter.</p>
            <p>THEIR civil conſtitution as the baſis of all their temporal felicity is their dear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt ſtake. Every privation of their natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral rights is ſubverſive of their happineſs, and every infringement of the form of their conſtitution has a tendency to ſuch privation: The preſervation of their conſtitutional rights, in every fit method, will therefore ever forceably claim their attention; and to this purpoſe, while they are awake to a ſenſe of their inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt, the vigilance and care of their rulers
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:011071_0059_0F854B4B613CDD88"/>
will, of right, be earneſtly expected by them.</p>
            <p>THEIR being dependent on the ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme power of the nation as a part of the <hi>whole,</hi> is ſo far from making it un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to remonſtrate under grievances of this nature, that it is a reaſon why they ſhould do ſo; when by the conſtitution every ſubject has an equal claim to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tection and ſecurity in the exerciſe of that very power.</p>
            <p>THEIR being loyal ſubjects to the beſt of Kings, whom may God long preſerve! and diſpoſed to cultivate, and if poſſible to increaſe their loyalty, will always in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline his gracious ear; and give weight to their petitions with his parliament.</p>
            <p>WITH indifference to ſurrender conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutional rights, or with raſhneſs to oppoſe conſtitutional meaſures, is equally to <hi>rebel</hi> againſt the ſtate. Anarchy and ſlavery are both diametrically oppoſite to the genius of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> conſtitution, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to the conſtitution of the God of nature; and equal care at leaſt is to be
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:011071_0060_0F854B4C21F57F28"/>
taken to avoid the former as the latter. A ready compliance with conſtitutional meaſures will always juſtify a tenacious claim to conſtitutional privileges, and ſupport the hope of their continuance.</p>
            <p>THE wellfare of the province, at all times, demands the attention of the guar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dians of our natural and |civil rights; to this purpoſe the legiſlative and executive powers are to be exerciſed. But laws are uſeleſs in a ſtate, unleſs they are o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed; nor will putting the executive power into the beſt hands avail to the deſigned purpoſe, if there is not proper application made to it upon thoſe oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſions that require the exerciſe of it; for in proportion to the want of this ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication the moſt excellent <hi>code</hi> of laws will be a dead letter. It is neceſſary in the nature of the thing, and indiſpenſably obligatory upon the people to unite their endeavours with their rulers to give life and energy to the laws in producing the deſigned happy effects.</p>
            <p>WE have good laws; and magiſtrates appointed to put <hi>thoſe</hi> laws into execution,
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:011071_0061_0F854B4CE7E9BA48"/>
whoſe fidelity may not be impeached: What therefore ſeems to remain to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plete our political happineſs is the exer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting ourſelves to aid the civil power, in ſurpreſſing every thing that may be detri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental, and in promoting that which may be of advantage to the <hi>whole.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>THOUGH <hi>ſome</hi> are appointed and bound by oath to give information of breaches of the law which come within their knowledge, yet <hi>all</hi> are under cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain obligation to aſſiſt in conveying ſuch information through the proper channels to the executive power, as it is the <hi>ordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance of God</hi> for the good of the commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity. But from the want of a due re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard to the public—or from a miſguided fondneſs for ourſelves, we are too apt to be criminally indulgent to one another, and of conſequence to deſert the magiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trate, and in ſome degree fruſtrate the deſign of his office. We have laws <hi>wiſely</hi> provided againſt the evils of <hi>idleneſs</hi> and <hi>intemperance</hi>—and whatever has appeared to the wiſdom of the legiſlature to be hurtful to ſociety; to whom then may the increaſe of ſuch diſorders be attribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted?
<pb n="63" facs="unknown:011071_0062_0F854B4F92332E00"/>
to <hi>thoſe</hi> whoſe buſineſs it is to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute the law upon offenders, on due in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, or <hi>thoſe</hi> who rather than give ſuch information chuſe to have <hi>fellowſhip</hi> with iniquity:—But not only they who are ſpecially appointed for the purpoſe, but <hi>all</hi> ſhould attend to the moral obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion they are under to exert themſelves, in their reſpetive ſtations, to prevent the interruption of the happineſs of ſociety, and inſtead of leaving the magiſtrates unaided, ſhould voluntarily <hi>riſe up for</hi> them <hi>againſt the evil doers,</hi> and lend their aſſiſtance to bring <hi>the workers of iniquity</hi> to condign puniſhment.</p>
            <p>BY this general exertion the moſt hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py effects would be produced;— tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſors would ſoon be taught a greater reverence for the law, and all be more ſecure in the enjoyment of their rights: Hereby obſtructions would be removed, and the executive power have free courſe; and <hi>judgment</hi> would <hi>run down as waters and righteouſneſs as a mighty ſtream.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>INSTEAD therefore of ſpeaking <hi>evil of dignities,</hi> and cruelly charging them with
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:011071_0063_0F854B50545644B0"/>
the blame of prevailing diſorders, we ſhould recriminate on ourſelves, and do our part to aid the magiſtrates in putting the laws <hi>already</hi> made into execution, and conſide in the wiſdom and fidelity of the legiſlators to make ſuch <hi>new ones</hi> as the circumſtances of the community may re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire.</p>
            <p>AND while the guardians of THIS PEOPLE are intent upon ſecuring their rights and promoting their happineſs, in every wiſe and laudable method, liberal ſupport ſhould be granted, great honors done, and chearful obedience yielded to them.</p>
            <p>OUR ſafety and happineſs muſt al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ariſe from the united exertions of rulers and ruled to the ſame ſalutary pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes. The ſecurity of our liberty and property by the fundamental laws of our civil conſtitution is the ſtrongeſt motive to maintain an inviolable attachment to it; and to exert ourſelves to promote the intereſt of the nation to which we be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long. Every well-directed effort to ſupport the conſtitution on which the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:011071_0064_0F854B51110F62C8"/>
of the <hi>whole</hi> depends, and to aug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment the wealth and ſtrength of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> empire, as our duty and intereſt, ſhould be readily made by us. To mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiply ſettlements on the uncultivated lands, and reduce the <hi>wilderneſs</hi> to <hi>a fruit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful field,</hi> by emigration from our older towns, and eſpecially by the introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of foreigners not unfriendly to our conſtitution — to make greater im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provements in agriculture and in every uſeful art evidently tends to the general welfare.</p>
            <p>ARBITRARY and oppreſſive meaſures in the ſtate would indeed diſpirit the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple and weaken the nerves of induſtry, and in their conſequences lead to pover<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and ruin; but a mild and equitable adminiſtration, will encourage their hearts and ſtrengthen their hands to exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cute with vigor thoſe meaſures which promote the ſtrength and ſafety of the whole.</p>
            <p>To lay a foundation of greater ſecuri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to <hi>ourſelves</hi> is indeed a laudable mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:011071_0065_0F854B51CEC1D8E8"/>
to ſuch efforts; and may be juſtified by the principle of ſelf-preſervation: But the advantages of ſuch improvements will not be confined to ourſelves—the more populous and opulent we grow, the more able we ſhall be to defend this important part of the <hi>Britiſh</hi> dominions—the more our nation will be a terror to her enemies—and the better able ſhall we be to make remittance for what we ſhall neceſſarily want of her manufactures.</p>
            <p>BY a proper attention to the general intereſt, and vigorous purſuits of mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures that tend to promote it, things may be put into ſuch a ſituation as to be of mutual advantage. The growth and proſperity of her colonies muſt be of real advantage to <hi>Great-Britain.</hi>— The means for exportation being increased in them, will be ſo to the colonies, by winch they may ſink their preſent heavy debts, and more eaſily defray neceſſary public charges.</p>
            <p>THE ſame attention, with a little pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, would lead us to retrench extra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vagant
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:011071_0066_0F854B52205BDBF8"/>
expences, and to promote fruga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity, good order, and induſtry, that we might give a ſeaſonable check to increa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sing debility, enjoy what we poſſeſs to more advantage and widen the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of future felicity. Under greater advantages we may receive monitory and directive hints, by turning our eye to the provident ant, <hi>which having no guide, overſeer or ruler provides her meat in the ſammer and gathereth her food in the harveſt.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>WE are now reaping the happy fruits of our Fathers <hi>hard</hi> labor and <hi>ineſſable</hi> ſufferings; and ſhall not a concern for future generations warm our hearts—produce ſome acts of ſelf denial, and cloſer application for their ſakes? or ſhall we do nothing for our <hi>poſterity</hi> when the firſt renowned ſettlers, here, did ſo much for <hi>theirs?</hi> Could <hi>they</hi> look down—or rather be permitted in fleſh to viſit their dear-bought country, with what aſtoniſhment would they behold the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grateful neglect — with what ſeverity reprove the proſtitution of patrimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nial
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:011071_0067_0F854B542D0106D0"/>
privileges, and chide the cri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minal want of philanthropy, in their degenerate offspring : and with what ardor would they urge them to perfect the work they had nobly begun, and thereby make room for millions yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>born quietly to enjoy their natural, their civil, and religious liberties.</p>
            <p>IN fine. To ſecure his own, and to promote the happineſs of others, is the part of every one in this great aſſembly. <hi>To this end</hi> were we <hi>born, and for this cauſe came we into the world.</hi> We were placed in that rank of being, and under thoſe circumſtances, which the infinitely wiſe and good Creator ſaw proper. And as we are moral agents, and accountable; it is of great importance to us in every ſtation, to keep in view the <hi>end</hi> of our being called into exiſtence.</p>
            <p>THIS is but the bud of being—we are candidates for a ſucceeding ſtate ; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to which, we are aſſured by the <hi>goſpel</hi> of the Son of God, the conſequences of our actions in <hi>this,</hi> will follow us, Nor in
<pb n="69" facs="unknown:011071_0068_0F854B54C54C23E0"/>
the conſtitution of thing have we long to continue here, but mortality will ſoon tranſlate us to the ſtate of retribution. With what care then ſhould we avoid e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very action debaſing to the mind, and with what aſſiduity purſue thoſe that tend to raiſe it to nobler heights.</p>
            <p>BY inattention and vice we may for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feit the bleſſings of <hi>creation</hi> and <hi>redemption,</hi> and by a continued courſe of fordid and unworthy actions, diſhonorary to God and unfriendly to mankind, we may fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh the ruins of our nature; and put ourſelves into a ſuch ſtate, that it would have been <hi>good</hi> for us if <hi>we had never been born.</hi> But by a diligent improvement of the talents committed to our truſt in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes of piety towards God, and charity to men, we may enoble the mind, and qualify it for the ſublime happineſs for which it was originally deſigned. Having therefore acted our part with fidelity in the ſervice of God and our generation, we ſhall quit this imperfect ſtate with dignity and honor, and rie ſuperior to the higheſt grandeur and felicity in theſe
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:011071_0069_0F854B5529E63DF8"/>
regions of mortality ; and by the immeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted munificence of the Creator — walk —
