            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

               <head>Miſs BETSEY ALLGOOD.</head>
               <p>THIS pretty little Miſs, though now but in the ſeventh Year of her Age, has more Thought and Prudence than many at ſeventeen. She works at her Needle to Admi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, reads like a little Queen, and writes a very pretty Hand. How far ſhe has improved in the Art of Drawing, the Specimen in the next Page will ſhew.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="10" facs="unknown:020440_0005_0FAF0A46B0199D28"/>
                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>However pretty theſe Accompliſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments may be conſidered, yet they are but trifling when compared with the Graces of her Mind; I mean, her good and pretty Behav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iour. She never laughs at thoſe who may not happen to know ſo much as herſelf, but ſhe endeavours to inſtruct them; ſhe is not ſatisfied
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:020440_0005_0FAF0A46B0199D28"/>with telling them that ſuch a Thing was done wrong, but ſhe endeavours to tell them how to do it right.</p>
               <p>So great is her Reputation among all her little Friends and Neighbours, that whenever any Diſpute happens among them which they cannot ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle themſelves, Miſs Betſey is always applied to, to make up the Matter, and her Deciſion is never diſputed by either Party.</p>
               <p>Miſs Betſey ſays her Prayers con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly every Night and Morning, and ſays Grace before and after Meat. She never attempts to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradict her Papa or Mamma, but cheerfully does every Thing ſhe is bidden to do. By theſe Means ſhe pleaſes every one around her, and is herſelf perfectly happy; for it is
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:020440_0006_0FAF0A47A0B11078"/>impoſſible for a Child to be happy, who is perpetually whining and pi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning after every Thing, and equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly reſtleſs and unhappy even if it gets what it aſks for.</p>
               <p>Miſs Betſey's Pap and Mamma were wiſe People, and often remark<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that the Perviſity of Children is oftentimes more owing to the Miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>management of Parents, than to the Children themſelves. When Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren cry for any Thing, it ſhould never be given them; becauſe, if they get it by that Means, when they want any Thing that is impro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per for them, they will think they have only to cry, and then they will obtain it.</p>
               <p>Thus you ſee, my pretty little Readers, that Miſs Betſey never
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:020440_0006_0FAF0A47A0B11078"/>cries for any Thing ſhe wants, nor aſks for any Thing a ſecond Time, which has been once denied her. By this good Behaviour, Miſs Bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſey has acquired ſo great a Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, as will never be forgotten ſo long as a Leaf of this Book ſhall hold together.</p>

               <head>Maſter BILLY BAD-ENOUGH.</head>
               <p>THIS young Gentleman is one of thoſe Kinds of Characters which even we little great Writers find it difficult to deſcribe; becauſe there is in his Compoſition ſuch a ſtrange Mixture of Goodneſs and Naughtineſs, as in ſome Degree per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plexes us in what Light to place him.</p>
               <p>Maſter Billy Badenough was hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py in having the beſt of Parents, who ſpared no Expence to give him the beſt Education; and, it muſt be confeſſed, no Boy ſtudied his Book cloſer or better, or made a more ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pid Progreſs than he did. At the Age of nine Years, he could read, write, and caſt Accounts with any
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:020440_0007_0FAF0A488EF44328"/>one, had made ſome Progreſs in Latin and French, and underſtood ſome little Matters in Geography. He was very goodnatured, and rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dily parted with any Thing to his Playfellows.</p>
               <p>Theſe were his good Qualities; and I could wiſh I were not under the Neceſſity of repeating his bad ones; but you know that we little Biographers muſt ſpeak the Truth, and conceal nothing.</p>
               <p>One of his principal Faults was, that of robbing Orchards. It was but the other Day, that Mr. John Goodwell caught him in his Orch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ard, hanging with his whole Weight upon one of the Boughs of a Fruit-Tree, in order to break it off, and carry away both the Bough and the
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:020440_0008_0FAF0A490D7C50F8"/>Fruit thereon. This is an exact Repreſentation of the Matter.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>He was fond of going a Birdneſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; and, indeed, there would have been no Harm in this, had he, like good Boys in general, taken Care of the poor innocent little Things, and fed them; but it was his Rule ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:020440_0008_0FAF0A490D7C50F8"/>to bring home any. Some he would throw into Ponds and Riv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, and was even ſo hard-hearted and naughty, as to ſtand and laugh at the poor dear little Things while they were drowning and ſtruggling for Life. Others, that could nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther fly nor walk, he would ſet up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the Ground, and ſhy at them with Sticks until he had killed them, and even the few that he brought home, he took no Care of them, but ſuffered them to die for Want. This, however, is ſo melancholy a Subject that I cannot purſue it.</p>
               <p>His Papa, finding he was guilty of theſe, and many other naughty Tricks, ſuch as kicking up Boys Heels on the Ice, and fighting with every one who gave him the leaſt
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:020440_0009_0FAF0A4B6778EB60"/>Offence, determined him to ſend him to Sea, for which Purpoſe he is now learning Navigation. Should he happen to be caſt away on a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert Iſland, how can he expect to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive Mercy, who has ſhewn ſo lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to poor innocent Birds? But, I hope, as he grows older, he will grow better, and repent.</p>

               <head>Miſs NANCY CAREFUL.</head>
               <p>THIS pretty little amiable young Lady had the Misfortune to loſe her Mamma when ſhe was on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly four Years of Age, and to add to her Calamities, ſhe had hardly reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her ſeventh Year, when ſhe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed her dear Papa to his Grave. There certainly cannot be a greater Misfortune happen to little Ones, than the early Loſs of their Parents. Miſs Nancy was truly ſenſible of this. Her Papa and Mamma lay buried in the ſame Tomb; and this dear little Girl would often ſreal a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way from the Houſe of her Guard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ian to ſeat herſelf upon their Grave and water it with her Tears. Can
<pb n="20" facs="unknown:020440_0010_0FAF0A4C7121FCD8"/>you view this Picture, and not join in letting fall a Tear with Miſs Nancy Careful?</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>She had, however, poor little Maiden, two Things which contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>buted to conſole her under theſe terrible Misfortunes: The firſt was that ſhe lived in the Houſe of her
<pb n="21" facs="unknown:020440_0010_0FAF0A4C7121FCD8"/>Guardian, who faithfully diſcharg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Truſt repoſed in him; and ſecondly, that ſhe had an only Bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, who was worthy of ſuch a Siſter, and who did every Thing in his Power, to make her forget the terrible Loſs they had both ſuſtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; but I ſhall forbear ſaying any Thing here of that little Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, as I ſhall particularly ſpeak of him in the next Article of this my invaluable Work.</p>
               <p>Miſs Nancy not only attended cloſely to her Book and her Needle, but hardly ever ſpent an idle Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and ſo attentive was ſhe to improve herſelf in all uſeful Knowledge, that her Guardian was frequently obliged to force her out upon Viſits, leſt ſhe ſhould hurt
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:020440_0011_0FAF0A4CB38E93F0"/>her Health by too cloſe an Appli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation to what ſhe conſidered as her Duty. This, my pretty little Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, you know, is a very uncom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Caſe.</p>
               <p>Before the had reached the Age of ten Years, there was hardly any Youth in the Neighbourhood, ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther Maſter or Miſs, who could read, write, ſpell, and caſt up com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon Accounts with her; and, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out mentioning her Excellency in the fineſt Needle-work, her Paſtry, Pickles, and Preſerves, were juſtly admired by all the Gentry for many Miles round.</p>
               <p>All theſe Things conſidered it is no Wonder that a young Gentleman in thoſe Parts ſhould pay Miſs Nan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy a Viſit on her reaching her nine<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teenth

He found ſhe poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeſſed an uncommon Share of good Senſe, Meekneſs, and Affability, without the leaſt Tincture of Pride or Affectation. He ſoon married Miſs Nancy, who now rides about in her Coach, admired by her Huſband, beloved by her Friends, and envied only by thoſe who do not poſſeſs her Virtues.</p>

               <head>Maſter SAMMY CAREFUL.</head>
               <p>THIS young Gentleman is the Brother of the Lady, whoſe Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter I have juſt given. He is two Years older than his Siſter, and is worthy of the beſt Thing that can be ſaid of him.</p>
               <p>On the Death of his dear Papa, he felt the keeneſt Agonies, and was truly ſenſible of his Loſs; but when he ſaw his poor little dear Siſter's Heart ready to burſt with Tears and Grief, he thought it became neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry in him to ſtifle his own Sorrows, in order to alieviate thoſe of his Siſter.</p>
               <p>He would now and then cry with her, with a View to humour her; then he would ſuddenly wipe the
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:020440_0012_0FAF0A4D8DF16D70"/>Tears from her Cheeks, and reaſon with her on the Impropriety of their making themſelves miserable about what they could not recover, and which would even make their Parents unhappy in Heaven, did they know it. When Sammy found he had thus conſoled his Siſter, whom he moſt tenderly loved, he would him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſteal out into the Fields ſet him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf down at the Foot of a Tree, and there have his Cry out by himſelf. My pretty Readers do not your little beating Hearts feel an uncommon Emotion at the Sight of the Picture in the next Page? May you never have Occaſion to do the like!</p>
               <p>

                  <figure/>
               </p>
               <p>As Maſter Sammy had always been a very ſober and careful Child, and very attentive to his Books, it is no Wonder that he proved, in the End, to be an excellent Scholar.</p>
               <p>Accordingly, when he had reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the Age of fourteen, Mr. William Goodall, a wealthy Merchant in the
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:020440_0013_0FAF0A4E808CEE20"/>City of Boſton, took him into his Compting houſe, in order to bring him up in the mercantile Way, and thereby make his Fortune.</p>
               <p>This was a ſad Stroke upon his poor Siſter Nancy, who, after having loſt both her Papa and Mamma, was now likely to loſe her Brother like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe; but Sammy did all he could to appeaſe her, and aſſured her, that he would ſpend all his leiſure Time with her. This he moſt punctually performed, and never were Brother and Siſter ſo happy in each other's Company as they were.</p>
               <p>Mr. William Goodall was highly ſatisfied with Sammy's Behaviour, and, dying much about the Time that Miſs Nancy was married to the Gentleman, he left all his Buſineſs
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:020440_0014_0FAF0A4EF04BC8E8"/>to Sammy, together with a large Capital to carry it on. So much is Mr. Careful eſteemed, (for we muſt now no longer call him Maſter Sam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my) that he was choſen, at the late general Election, Repreſentative in the General Court, for one of the firſt Towns in New-England, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the leaſt Expence to himſelf. We here ſee what are the Effects of good Behaviour.</p>

               <head>Miſs FANNY DAUDLE.</head>
               <p>THIS young Lady was an only Child, and therefore, as is too often the Caſe, was a ruined one; that is, was ſuffered to do juſt what ſhe liked, without any one being permitted to contradict her. There was no ſuch Thing as getting her to Bed at Night, or up again in the Morning; for Miſs Fanny was ſaid to have ſo weakly a Conſtitution, that ſhe could not bear to be forced to any Thing.</p>
               <p>This young Lady in her infant Years, had every Appearance of a good Conſtitution, and never could more Pains have been taken to ſpoil it. She was covered with a Load
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:020440_0015_0FAF0A4FAD532A28"/>of Clothes, in order to keep her warm, and prevent her from taking Cold. They were conſtantly feed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her with the richeſt Things, in order to nouriſh her, and make her ſtrong, as they thought; and ſhe was not put upon her Legs until ſhe was eighteen Months old.</p>
               <p>In ſpite of all theſe Precautions, however, at the Age of ſix Years, Miſs was crooked both in her Legs and Shape, owing, no Doubt, to the very Means they took to prevent it, and this undoubtedly was a Fault of her Friends, and not her own, for which ſhe was much to be pitied, as are all unfortunate Children, who are ruined by the miſtaken Kindneſs of their Friends.</p>
               <p>It would have been unpardonable
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:020440_0015_0FAF0A4FAD532A28"/>in me to take notice of theſe perſonal Defects, had not the Imperfections of her Mind been ſtill greater. Though ſhe ſeldom aroſe until Noon, yet great Part of the remain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Day was ſpent in this Manner on the Couch.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>So little Time was ſpent on her Book, that even at ſix Years of Age
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:020440_0016_0FAF0A521E705FA8"/>ſhe could hardly tell a great A from a Houſe; and whenever ſhe was de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired to take a Needle in her Hand, ſhe was inſtantly overcome with the Vapours. She was hated by all the Servants, to whom ſhe was a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Plague; and very few of the young Ladies in the Neighbourhood choſe to viſit her, becauſe ſhe was no leſs peeviſh and obſtinate than ſhe was proud and ignorant. It was in one of theſe obſtinate Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and merely out of Contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diction to the Advice of every one, that ſhe determined to take a Walk out one Day, though it rained much. The Conſequence of this was, that ſhe caught a violent Cold, which brought on a Fever, and put and End to her Life in the twelfth Year of her Age.</p>
               <p>

This plainly ſhews you, my little Readers, how neceſſary it is to be induſtrious in every Thing elſe, as well as your Book; ſince Idleneſs and Obſtinacy are equally pernicious to thoſe who give Way to them.</p>

               <head>Maſter BILLY EASY.</head>
               <p>MY pretty little Readers, when they ſhall be grown up to Years of Maturity, will have too many Occaſions to obſerve, that it is as great a Misfortune to be of too eaſy a Temper, as to be of too vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lent a one, and here is an unhappy Inſtance of it.</p>
               <p>Maſter Billy Eaſy had always been conſidered by his Parents as a very dutiful and obedient Son, and they had conceived great Hopes from ſo promiſing a Child. He paid every due Attention to his Book, minded what was ſaid to him, and readily and cheerfully did every Thing he was bidden. If theſe were not pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſing
<pb n="35" facs="unknown:020440_0017_0FAF0A53255D9CE0"/>Circumſtances in his Favour, I know not what may be conſidered as ſuch; but ſuch are the unſettled Matters of this Life, that there is no anſwering for any Thing, or for any Body.</p>
               <p>Maſter Billy, in the tenth Year of his Age, unfortunately got acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with a Boy of a very naughty and bad Turn of Mind, who made uſe of very bad Expreſſions, told Fibs immoderately, and was always at the Head of every Kind of Miſchief that was going forwards. Billy Ea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſy was of a Diſpoſition, which, like Wax, might be moulded into any Form; and, had he happened to fall in good Company, he would un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly have learned Good from them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="36" facs="unknown:020440_0018_0FAF0A5370371420"/>
                  <hi>Lead us not into Temptation,</hi> is a Part of our Lord's Prayer, and a very ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary one it is. Maſter Billy be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the conſtant Companion of this naughty Boy, who led him into all kinds of Errour; and ſo powerful was the Force of bad Example over him, that he was often drawn into the Commiſſion of thoſe Crimes which his Heart diſapproved, but he could not withſtand the Temptation.</p>
               <p>He was frequently concerned in fobbing Orchards, and even ſtealing Fruit wherever he could find it. At laſt he became ſo naughty as to take up and put in his Pocket the looſe Halfpence his Papa or Mamma happened to leave any where. It will be too diſagreeable to me to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late every Circumſtance, which at
<pb n="37" facs="unknown:020440_0018_0FAF0A5370371420"/>laſt determined his Parents to ſend him to Sea, in order to avoid more <figure/>diſagreeable Conſequences. They did ſo, and poor Billy Eaſy periſhed in a Storm, and had a watry Grave.</p>
               <p>My dear little Readers, be cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tious of bad Company. Reſiſt the firſt Temptation to evil, and you
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:020440_0019_0FAF0A5431E3DDA8"/>will then have nothing to fear; but if you give Way to triſting Crimes, greater ones will ſteal on you inſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſibly, and you will even arrive at the higheſt Degree of Naughtineſs be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore you even ſee the Danger, or think you are doing any Thing amiſs.</p>

               <head>Miſs POLLY CHARITY.</head>
               <p>THIS young Lady was truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving of the Name the bore. It was the conſtant Study, even of her infant Years, to do all the Good ſhe could to her little Playfellows, with whom ſhe never quarrelled in her Life. Whenever ſhe knew of any poor little Creature in Diſtreſs, ſhe would beg a penny of her Papa or Mamma, and go and give it to it privately. She has been often known, when a Piece of nice Cake has been given her, to pretend to be eating it, and then take an Opportunity of ſliding it into her Pocket, in order to give into ſome poor Neighbour's Child.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="40" facs="unknown:020440_0020_0FAF0A553154A1B0"/>
One Day, ſome one of Miſs Pol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly's little Acquaintances, coming along the Road near Miſs Charity's Houſe, found her ſtanding and cry<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over a little Beggar, who ſat by the Side of the Road. This is a juſt Repreſentation of this pitiful Scene. <figure/>Her Acquaintance aſked her what ſhe
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:020440_0020_0FAF0A553154A1B0"/>was crying for. "My dear, (ſaid Polly) this poor little Creature is ſtarving, and I have not a Penny to give her; but if you will lend me Two pence, if you have ſo much about you, I will certainly pay you again very ſoon. What a terrible Thing it is to think, that while we live upon Dainties, this poor little Girl ſhall be ſtarving!"</p>
               <p>"My dear, (ſaid Miſs Polly's Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaintance) I am happy that I have Two-pence about me, which is all I am worth in the World, and thoſe were juſt now given me by a Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tleman for my pretty Behaviour to him. Here they are, and you ſhall be indebted to me only One Penny, for I will give her the other myſelf." They eagerly embraced each other.
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:020440_0021_0FAF0A561FE67930"/>gave the poor Child the Two-pence, and then parted highly delighted.</p>
               <p>It ſeems that Miſs Polly was al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowed a Halfpenny a Day for Pock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>et Money, and ſhe determined not to ſpend a Farthing of it till ſhe had paid her Debts. Accordingly, at the End of four Days, ſhe went to carry the Two-pence to her little Acquaintance, who abſolutely re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſed to take any more than One Penny of it. At laſt, to ſettle all Diſputes, it was agreed, that the Penny ſhould be given to a poor Neighbour's Child, which was ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly done; and here this im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Diſpute ended.</p>
               <p>This amiable Miſs Polly Charity in Time grew up to be a Woman, and had the Happineſs to get mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried
<pb n="43" facs="unknown:020440_0021_0FAF0A561FE67930"/>to a Gentleman of large For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune, who was equally charitable with herſelf.

               <p>THIS was a good Sort of a Boy enough, take him for all in all; and it may be ſaid of him, that he was neither remarkably good nor remarkably bad. In ſhort he was one of thoſe Characters, of whom we can ſay nothing that is very ill or very good.</p>
               <p>He always obeyed his Parents commands, and did as he was bid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den. Indeed, he was at his Books as long as any Boy, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to learn as much; but his prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Study, at leaſt that which pleaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him moſt, was caſting Accounts, and he had learned many intricate Intereſt Tables by Heart. Thus far
<pb n="45" facs="unknown:020440_0022_0FAF0A5699E3A3C8"/>he was undoubtedly a good Boy.</p>
               <p>In his very infant Years, he ſhewed a great Fondneſs for Money, and ſaved up every Halfpenny that was given him. I am told that he ſpent a great Part of his Time in thus counting over his Money.</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>If he at any Time lent any little
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:020440_0023_0FAF0A59005B6288"/>Fellow a Penny for a Week, he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways took a Farthing Intereſt; and if it was only a Halfpenny, he would be contented with taking a few Peaches, Apples, Pears, or what he could get, and theſe he always ſold again, and never eat them himſelf.</p>
               <p>Whenever he lent a Penny to a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny little Boy whom he thought ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>travagant, he always obliged him to leave in his Hands a Top, a Bat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tledore, a Gig, or ſome ſuch like Thing by way of Security, which he always ſold, if the Debt was not paid in proper Time.</p>
               <p>Though it is very neceſſary for young People to be careful and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, yet Maſter Simon began ſo early to have the Love of Money at Heart, that he never parted with
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:020440_0023_0FAF0A59005B6288"/>any Thing unleſs he had ſome View in it, and this made him ſelfiſh, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways ready to partake of what others had, but took Care never to part with any Thing himſelf. It ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears by a little Book that he left behind him (for he died in the tenth Year of his Age) that he in one Year, by lending out Money in the Manner I have mentioned, collected no leſs than the capital Sum of five Shillings and Two-pence three Far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>things, and that his capital Stock conſiſted of eighteen Shillings and five Pence Half penny; but to what publick Charity he left all this large Sum of Money, I could never learn. I have, indeed, heard it reported, that he left it to his Siſter to build her a Baby-houſe, and to properly furniſh it.</p>

               <p>But to return to Miſs Betſey Pert. This ſaid Boarding-ſchool Educa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion has ſo puſſed her up, that ſhe cannot even endure thoſe, who have been brought up in what ſhe con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiders as the vulgar Way.

               <p>THIS was a moſt ſingular young Gentleman for his Activity and Sprightlineſs, as well as for his Learning, Politeneſs and Affability. No little Gentleman could make a Bow more gracefully, on coming into, or going out of a Room, than Maſter Dickey Sprightly.</p>
               <p>In the Winter Seaſon, when the Ground was covered with Froſt and Snow, and the Weather ſo cold, that his Siſters were not permitted to go out, he would ſit by the Fire-ſide, and tell them ſuch a Number of pretty Stories, which he had read in his little gilt Books, as charmed
<pb n="54" facs="unknown:020440_0027_0FAF0A5C9FFACC50"/>every little One that heard him. This happy Accompliſhment of tel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling pretty little Stories, drew upon him ſo many invitations to ſpend Evening after Evening with Maſters and Miſſes in the moſt reſpectable Families, that he was never at a Loſs to know what to do with his lei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure Time. So glad was every one to have his Company, that they al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways treated him with Plenty of Fruits, Pies, Tarts, Cheeſecakes and Cuſtards, in order to buy the Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of his Company again.</p>
               <p>In the Summer Time, he was here and there and every where; ſometimes up in a Tree, ſometimes down in a Fit, and ſometimes ſcam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pering along the plain Ground, in Purſuit of any Thing that happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed
<pb n="55" facs="unknown:020440_0027_0FAF0A5C9FFACC50"/>to come in his Way: Here you ſee him running after a Rabbit in a Warren; but I will lay a Penny, that he will never overtake it.</p>

Maſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter Dickey has now left off all Play, and is become as ſolid as an old Man. He is now making great Progreſs in the Knowledge of the Law; and if we may be permitted

               <p>THIS amiable little Maiden was the only Child of very reſpec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>table Parents, who took every Care in their Power to give her a good Education, and to inſtill into her Mind the ſoundeſt Principles of Virtue. Her Papa was once a weal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy Merchant; but from Loſſes which the wiſeſt cannot foreſee, his Circumſtances became much re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duced. He therefore determined to make one bold Puſh, in order, if poſſible, to retrieve himſelf. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly fitted out a Ship, in which he ventured his All, and went on board of it himſelf; but alas, they had ſcarcely got clear of the Land,
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:020440_0029_0FAF0A5FCB86CA58"/>when a Hurricane aroſe, the Ship was daſhed to Pieces on a Rock, and every Soul on board periſhed. What a melancholy Scene is this!</p>
               <figure/>
               <p>Every Thing was now loſt, and the unhappy Widow, Mrs. Thought<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful, was forced to give up every Thing to unrelenting Creditors.
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:020440_0030_0FAF0A611FBE28E0"/>This good Lady took theſe Misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes ſo much to Heart, that ſhe died ſoon after, leaving poor Miſs Charlotte totally deſtitute of the Neceſſaries of Life.</p>
               <p>Though I am but a young Wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and little acquainted with the Commerce of the World, yet I am fully convinced, from the very lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle I have ſeen, that Honour, Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bity, and Virtue, will always find ſome Friend when in Diſtreſs.</p>
               <p>Miſs Charlotte, who was but four Years of Age, was too young to feel all the Weight of this Misfortune, though ſhe dearly loved her Parents, and ſhed Torrents of Tears on the Loſs of them. There lived in the Neighbourhood a Maiden Lady of great Fortune, who had always ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mired
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:020440_0030_0FAF0A611FBE28E0"/>the Sweetneſs and Affability of Miſs Charlotte's Temper. This Lady took the ſweet Orphan home to her Houſe, and treated her, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Reſpect, as though ſhe had been her Daughter. Private Tutors at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended her at home to inſtruct her in every uſeful Accompliſhment; and her different Tutors found they had very little Trouble in making her comprehend the moſt difficult Things. Miſs Charlotte always called the Lady her Mamma, and paid her equally the ſame Reſpect as though ſhe had been ſuch. The Lady, in Return, took the pretty little Orphan with her into the po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liteſt Company, where ſhe was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly admired by every one for the Politeneſs of her Converſation, and
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:020440_0031_0FAF1144F068EDD8"/>the Affability and Sweetneſs of her Diſpoſition. In this Manner, Time inſenſibly ſtole away, until Miſs Charlotte had nearly reached the nineteenth Year of her Age, when her worthy Friend died, leaving her poſſeſſed of her whole Eſtate, and recommending her to the Care of her Nephew, to whom the whole of her Eſtate was to devolve, in Caſe Miſs Charlotte ſhould refuſe to marry him; but Miſs Charlotte loved him: They married and were happy.</p>

               <p>THIS pretty little Fellow, or, I ſhould rather ſay, this pretty little young Gentleman, who is now but in the eighth Year of his Age, ſeems to be born to be a great Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thor.

My little Friend Jemmy is conſtantly reading: and here you ſee him, even at nine o'Clock at Night, with a Book in his Hand, and ſitting by the Fire Side.</p>

               <p>For my own Part, though I love my Book very well (and I have the Vanity to think, that what I have here written will ſufficiently prove it) yet I love a Bit of Play and Fun, now and then, as well as any Boy; for I think it is a juſt Obſervation, that too much of one Thing is good
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:020440_0032_0FAF1145B853D0A8"/>for nothing; and even the wiſe Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>omon tells us, there is a Time and Seaſon for all Things. I mean not this as any Reflection upon my dear Companion Jemmy; I only fear, that, by his ſticking ſo very cloſe to his Books, he may hurt his Conſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tution; for we may carry too far e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven the moſt laudable Purſuits. I hope my little Readers will not im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agine that I am jealous of Maſter Jemmy's Abilities, and fearful that he may rival me in writing ſuch little Books as theſe: No, though I am but a little Fellow, I have a great Soul, and am above all thoughts of Jealouſy.

Though he is born to a very large Fortune, yet he treats the pooreſt with the ſame Reſpect as the rich; for it is his Maxim, that it is Virtue and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius only, and not Fortune, that ſhould diſtinguiſh between the dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Beings here below. Six poor little Boys come conſtantly twice a Week to his Houſe, on whom he ſpends two Hours each Time, in order to inſtruct them in Reading, Writing, and Accounts. He like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe lays out moſt of his Pocket-mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney in little gilt Books, which he diſtributes among the little needy Ones; and even Bibles, Teſtaments, and Common-Prayer Books he fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently

               <p>It is no Wonder that Maſter Iſaac is a Dunce; for thoſe, who trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble themſelves ſo much about other People's Buſineſs, ſeldom mind their own. He ſeldom ſate down to write, unleſs it was to inform ſome little Companion of an im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant Piece of News: Such as,

               <p>It is no Wonder, that this Kind of Behaviour procured Maſter Iſaac many Enemies and few Friends; for when it is once known, that a little Boy gives his Mind to Tale<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bearing, he is ſoon conſidered as a dangerous Enemy in the Aſſemblies of little Maſters and Miſſes. I do not mean, that little Maſters or

<pb n="84" facs="unknown:020440_0042_0FAF115006F23A90"/>As to entering on any Diſcourſe on little Books, ſhe cannot bear it, for Reading, ſhe ſays, ſpoils her Eyes, and makes her Head ach. As to making up her own Caps and Linen, her Mamma will not ſuffer her to do it, becauſe it would ſpoil the Milliner's Trade. So that her whole Time is ſpent in little more than eating, drinking, goſſipping, dreſſing, undreſſing, and ſleeping. In ſhort, ſhould Miſs Fiddle Faddle live to be a Woman, I do not know of a better Huſband for her than Maſter Iſaac Curious.</p>

               <p>THIS young Gentleman, though in the ſeventh Year of his Age, is by no Means fond of Company, tho' I know of no little Gentleman better qualified for it than he is, as he has always loved his Book, read a great deal, and has a very good Memory, nor do I know of anyone among my little Acquaintance whom I more eſteem than Maſter Billy Baſhful. But this is his Way of walking in the Street, ſo ſhame-faced that he cannot hold up his Head.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="87" facs="unknown:020440_0043_0FAF115079708B48"/>

               </p>
               <p>Though I would by no Means wiſh any of my pretty little Readers to be pert or impudent in Compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny, yet I do not like to ſee Children over baſhful; for a cheerful and lively Turn in Converſation is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways the moſt agreeable, and never
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:020440_0044_0FAF115179952660"/>fails to make either a Maſter or Miſs taken Notice of; but poor Billy Baſhful, though he poſſeſſes ſo many Talents for Converſation, ſeldom opens his Mouth in Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and therefore paſſes for a Blockhead in the Opinion of thoſe who do not know him. This, how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever, ſhould be a Leſſon to my Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, not to deſpiſe any little One, merely becauſe they do not talk much; for Experience has convinc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us, that thoſe who ſit ſtill and ſay nothing, are often wiſer than thoſe who talk a great deal.</p>
               <p>My little Readers muſt adapt their Converſation to the Company they may happen to be in. When they are in Company with none but little Ones like themſelves, they
<pb n="89" facs="unknown:020440_0044_0FAF115179952660"/>may then, if they now and then chooſe it, let their little Clappers run nineteen to the Dozen; but when they are in Company with their Superiours, they muſt not be too fond of hearing themſelves talk, in order, as they may think, to ſhew their Wit: On the contrary, they muſt never ſpeak but when they are ſpoken to, and, when a Queſtion is aſked them, they muſt give a direct Anſwer in as few Words as poſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble. This will be conſidered as Modeſty and not Baſhfulneſs. And here it may be neceſſary for me to explain to my little Readers, the Difference between Baſhfulneſs and Modeſty.</p>
               <p>Modeſty requires, that a young Gentleman or Lady ſhould give a
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:020440_0045_0FAF115294D874D0"/>direct Anſwer to any Queſtion that is aſked them, without Fear or Trembling; but, at the ſame Time, it requires you to ſay no more than is neceſſary; whereas Baſhfulneſs prevents little Ones anſwering any Queſtions that are put to them, until the Queſtion has been aſked them three or four Times over, which is always diſagreeable, as it borders upon all Manners. Thus you ſee, that Modeſty is deſirable, but Baſhfulneſs ſhould be ſhunned.</p>

               <head>Miſs FANNY SQUEAMISH.</head>
               <p>I AM afraid my pretty little Readers will begin to think me an ill-natured Sort of an Author, who is more pleaſed with picking out faulty Characters than good ones; but I would beg Leave to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mind them, that by pointing out to them what is a Blemiſh in other little Folks, it may enable them to avoid the like in themſelves. Were I to lay before my little Readers nothing but good Characters, they would be of no Uſe to them, as Self Love and Vanity would induce them to think that they were equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly good themſelves; whereas, by
<pb n="92" facs="unknown:020440_0046_0FAF115366FD0C70"/>ſeeing the Errours of other little Ones laid before them, they begin to enquire in themſelves, whether they are not guilty of the like. I would adviſe all my Readers to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pare every Character they here read with themſelves, and the Compari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon may perhaps prove uſeful to them.</p>
               <p>It muſt be confeſſed, that Miſs Fanny Squeamiſh was of but a weakly Conſtitution; but this was in a great Meaſure owing to her being too much indulged in her In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fancy. Not a Breath of Air from Doors or Windows, that could be excluded, was ſuffered to approach her; and, when ſhe went abroad, ſhe was wrapped up in ſuch a Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner, that you would ſuppoſe the Air
<pb n="93" facs="unknown:020440_0046_0FAF115366FD0C70"/>of this Country was like that of Norway or Friezeland.</p>
               <p>Sometimes ſhe was carried about the Streets in this Manner; and you <figure/>may eaſily judge what Benefit ſhe could receive from the Air, when ſhut up in a Sedan Chair.</p>
               <p>There are ſome young Ladies, and Miſs Fanny is one of them,
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:020440_0047_0FAF11546472C3C8"/>who would be exceedingly unhap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py, ſhould any one tell them, that they never looked better in all their Lives; for theſe ſqueamiſh Sort of young Ladies are never more hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>py than when they are pitied, and ſome of them expect, that a whole Company ſhould be ſad and mel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ancholy, becauſe they happen to fancy themſelves indiſpoſed. If their Finger does but ach, from the Scratch of a Pin, or any other trif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling Accident, the whole Houſe is in an Uproar, the Doctor and A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pothecary ſent for, and the Knocker inſtantly muffled, as a Token to all the Neighbours that Miſs Fan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny is very ill.</p>
               <p>My little Readers may perhaps think, that I am telling them this as
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:020440_0047_0FAF11546472C3C8"/>a Tale to amuſe them; but I do aſſure them, upon my little Hon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our, that I do, at this Time, know a young Lady, who anſwers, in e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very Point, to the Deſcription I have here given of Miſs Fanny Squea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſh. But I hope my Readers will ever have too much good Senſe, to attempt to make People believe they are ill when nothing ails them, for we have real Evils enough, without raiſing imaginary ones.</p>

               <head>Maſter TOMMY PRUDENCE.</head>
               <p>THE Caſe of this little young Gentleman was, in the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant Part of his Years, much to be pitied. He was born of affluent Parents, but his Mother died while he was an Infant, and his Father, having met with great Loſſes in Trade, became a Bankrupt, and left poor Tommy entirely unpro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vided for at the Age of nine Years.</p>
               <p>His Father's Effects were all ſold for the Benefit of his Credi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors, and poor Tommy was left to the wide World to ſeek his For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune. He had cried bitterly enough for the Loſs of his dear Father;
<pb n="97" facs="unknown:020440_0048_0FAF1154DEA23578"/>but, as ſoon as theſe firſt Struggles were over, he very wiſely reflected, that, though he had loſt a kind and indulgent Father, yet he was ſenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, that all the Tears in the World would not reſtore him to his Careſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes, and that it was now his Duty to conſider of what Steps were to be taken, in order to preſerve him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf from Want, and thereby pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent any Reflection being thrown on the Memory of his dear Father.</p>
               <p>As Tommy had already learned to read, write, and caſt Accounts moſt prettily, he determined to offer his Services to Mr. Worthy, who was a Merchant of great Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and had formerly dealed with his Father. Tommy walked up and down the Street a long Time
<pb n="98" facs="unknown:020440_0049_0FAF1155738A0FB0"/>before he had Reſolution enough to knock at the Door. At laſt he did, was let in, and introduced to Mr. Worthy, who having liſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with great Attention to his in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nocent and artleſs Tale, eagerly embraced him, promiſed to be his Friend, took him inſtantly into his Houſe, and made him one of his Clerks; and here he is at Buſineſs.</p>

Tommmy, Night and Morning, thanked God for theſe Marks of his Goodneſs, and employed all his leiſure Hours in the Improvement of his Mind, and in ſuch Accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſhments as he thought might be uſeful to him in his preſent Station.</p>
               <p>By theſe means he ſoon became a very accompliſhed young Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man, and gained the Eſteem of his Maſter and all the Gentlemen their Houſe had Dealings with. So that, in a few Years, he became firſt Clerk. In this Capacity he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued until he was twenty-one Years of Age, when Mr. Worthy was happy to diſcover that there was a ſecret Liking between Mr. Prudence and his only Daughter. Mr. Worthy gave him his Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="100" facs="unknown:020440_0050_0FAF1156363E7980"/>in Marriage, and Mr. Prudence accepted of her as one of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Bleſſings this World could beſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tow. They now joined in Part<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerſhip, and all three live a Life of Happineſs, bleſſing that Hour, in which it pleaſed God to bring them acquainted with each other.</p>

               <head>Miſs POLLY HONEYCOMB.</head>
               <p>THIS pretty little Miſs is one of the moſt worthy Charac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters I have attempted to hand down to Poſterity, by inſerting it in this valuable Work, which will un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doubtedly be read by the little Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren of future Ages.</p>
               <p>Miſs Polly Honeycomb (will you believe it my little Readers!) is nev<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er out of Temper. Let what will happen, ſhe conſtantly preſerves the Serenity of her Temper, and looks upon thoſe Diſappointments, which vex and torment other little Maids, with the utmoſt Indifference. If that Day happens to turn out rainy, which ſhe and ſome other little Ones had appointed to go abroad
<pb n="102" facs="unknown:020440_0051_0FAF11574195CEB8"/>upon a Party of Pleaſure, it gives her not the leaſt Concern, and ſhe endeavours to conſole her Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panions by ſaying, "To be ſure, we did intend to have a good deal of Pleaſure Today, and I dare ſay we ſhould, had the Weather proved fine: But who can tell, but that it has pleaſed God to order it to rain Today, in order to keep us at home, and thereby avoid ſome dreadful Accident, which might have hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pened to us had we gone abroad? Beſides, this Rain will do more Good to the Huſbandman and Farmer, than we ſhall all our Lives. You know we can go a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad another Day."</p>
               <p>It was in this Manner this amia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble young Lady reconciled herſelf to
<pb n="103" facs="unknown:020440_0051_0FAF11574195CEB8"/>every Diſappointment that happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; for ſhe conſidered God as the Director of all Things, and thought it would be very naughty in her to repine at what he was pleaſed to direct. I once heard her ſay (which I ſhall never forget) "To be ſure, it is a moſt terrible Thing to loſe our dear Papa or Mamma, or even any particular Friend; but then we ſhould remember, that they are taken from this World, which I am told is a very wicked one, to enjoy everlaſting Reſt in Heaven."</p>
               <p>Were every little Maiden, and I may ſay Maſter too, to act in this Manner, what a World of Uneaſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs would they ſave themſelves. There would then be no crying and ſobbing about the meereſt Trifles,
<pb n="104" facs="unknown:020440_0052_0FAF1157B7F9A6A0"/>and often about what it would be dangerous to let them have. Miſs Polly is not only always gay, happy, and cheerful herſelf, but makes o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers ſo alſo wherever ſhe is. In ſhort, ſo ſweet and amiable is her Temper, that ſhe more reſembles a little Angel than a Deſcendant of Adam and Eve. Strive to imitate her, my dear little Readers, if you wiſh to be wiſe and happy as this young Lady is.</p>

            <p>IT is but juſt and reaſonable, af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter I have taken the Liberty to write ſo freely of ſo many little Maſters and Miſſes, that I ſhould give ſome ſhort Account of myſelf, and prove my Right to the import<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ant
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:020440_0055_0FAF115B0930DFF0"/>Character I have here aſſumed, in preſuming to judge of the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of others.</p>
            <p>To proceed.—My Papa is a Clergyman, and one of the fineſt Scholars in the Kingdom. He has written ſeveral valuable Sermons, which have received the Approba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of almoſt all the religious old Ladies in the Kingdom. My Mam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ma was formerly the Governeſs of a very capital Boarding-School for young Ladies, which ſhe retired from with the pleaſing Reflection of ſeeing ſeveral young Ladies ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rived at the Age of Maturity, who, under my Mamma's Directions, had acquired an uncommon Share of polite Education, and every fe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>male Accompliſhment. It is there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="112" facs="unknown:020440_0056_0FAF115C0DC5DD18"/>no Wonder, that I ſhould im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>itate my Parents, and thus, in a very early Period of my Life, take upon me to direct little Maſters and Miſſes, as I hope, hereafter, when I ſhall become a Man, and a Cler<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gyman, to point out to my Flock the ſublimeſt Truths of Religion and Morality.</p>
            <p>I was born on the 1ſt of January, in the Year of our Lord, 1770; and as ſoon as I was born, I was declared to be the very Model of my Parents: I was inſtantly pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced to have Mamma's Eyes, Papa's Noſe, Aunt's Mouth, and Uncle's Chin; and one old Lady in particular, putting on her Spec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tacles, in order to examine my Fea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures more minutely, cried out in a
<pb n="113" facs="unknown:020440_0056_0FAF115C0DC5DD18"/>prophetick Strain, "I will venture to propheſy, that this ſweet Babe will one Day or other become a great Writer and a valuable Preach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er."</p>
            <p>I can recollect very little of my infant Years, further than that my Nurſe would frequently obſerve, that I was always exceedingly diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſed whenever ſhe made Uſe of the Bells on my Choral, by ſhak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them to amuſe me; and ſhe has ſince told me, that nothing would quiet me ſo ſoon as taking up a Book and reading to me, though I certainly could not, at that Age, underſtand a ſingle Syllable ſhe pronounced. This Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance I have often heard my Papa himſelf confirm.</p>

When I came to be breeched, I laid aſide all juvenile Sports, and was a very poor Hand at Marbles, Trap-Ball, or Cricket. Indeed I was ſo little attentive to Play, that I was ſoon diſregarded by the reſt of the Boys, who conſidered me as a dull heavy little Fellow. If ever they got quarrelling together, I never uſed to intermeddle, but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tired to a Corner, pulled out ſome little Book, which I always carried about me, and left them to fight it out among themſelves, as you here ſee.</p>

            </p>
            <p>I was never happier than when I could get into my Papa's Study, and, even long before I had any Idea how to form a Letter, I would get a Pen in my Hand, and fill a large Piece of Paper, with what may be called Pot-Hooks and Hangers.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="116" facs="unknown:020440_0058_0FAF115DF93631C8"/>
My Papa ſoon diſcovered my natural Inclinations, and encourag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed and cheriſhed my early and eager Purſuit after Knowledge. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly taught me how to hold my Pen, then how to make ſmall Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, then larger ones, and ſo on, until within ten Months, when I had learned to write as good a Hand as moſt of the little Boys in our Neighbourhood who were twice my Age. I likewiſe conquered the four firſt Rules in Arithmetick in a Trice, and my Papa tells me, that he doubts not, but that I ſhall by and by be a great Mathemati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cian and Divine.</p>
            <p>After I had learned to write and read like a Man, my Papa adviſed me to ſit down and write ſhort Let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters
<pb n="117" facs="unknown:020440_0058_0FAF115DF93631C8"/>out of my own Head, which I accordingly did; and, as I have a great many of theſe by me, I may, ſome time or other, find Leiſure to peruſe and correct them for the Preſs, when I ſhall lay them before my little Readers for their Amuſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment as well as Improvement.</p>
            <p>After I had finiſhed a vaſt Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of theſe Letters, my Papa adviſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed me to riſe one Step higher, and write the Characters of all the lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle Maſters and Miſſes I could re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collect; but of all Things com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manded me to conceal the proper Names of the Parties and give them borrowed Titles. How far this firſt Publication of a little Writer may pleaſe the little World, I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not tell; but they may be aſſured,
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:020440_0059_0FAF115E6FFAF968"/>that it has coſt me much Labour and Study.</p>
            <p>I would adviſe all the little Read<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ers, into whoſe Hands this Book may fall, carefully to notice all the different Characters they have here read, and thereby regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late their Conduct and Behaviour, not only when they are at their own Homes, but more particularly when they are abroad upon Viſits. If they carefully obſerve the Conduct of others, they will often have Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion to lament, that Maſters and Miſſes are not always ſo good as they ſhould be. When they evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dently diſcover Imperfections in others, before they venture to cen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure or find Fault with them, they ſhould carefully examine themſelves,
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:020440_0059_0FAF115E6FFAF968"/>whether they likewiſe have not been guilty of the ſame Kind of naughty Actions, or at leaſt others equally as bad. By accuſtoming themſelves to this Kind of Self-Examination, they will acquire not only a Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of others, but of themſelves alſo, which is the moſt deſirable Thing in this Life to be thorough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly acquainted with.</p>
            <p>Thus, my little Readers, have I finiſhed this <hi>original</hi> Work, not a ſingle Line of it having been taken from any Book whatever. Is there any <hi>great</hi> Author living, who can, as truly ſay ſo much of any of his Works?</p>
