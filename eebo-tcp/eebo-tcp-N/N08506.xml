            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>

                  <salute>My Dear Countrymen,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I AM a FARMER, settled after a variety of fortunes, near the banks, of the river <hi>Delaware,</hi> in the province of <hi>Pennsylvania.</hi> I received a liberal education, and have been engaged in the busy scenes of life: But am now convinced, that a man may be as happy without bustle, as with it. My farm is small, my servants are few, and good; I have a little money at interest; I wish for no more: my employment in my own af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fairs is easy; and with a contented grateful mind, I am compleating the number of days allotted to be my divine goodness.</p>
               <p>Being master of my time, I spend a good deal of it in a library, which I think the most valuable part of my small estate; and
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:010876_0004_0F851FB4A355F988"/>
being acquainted with two or three gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men of abilities and learning, who honour me with their friendship, I believe I have acquired a greater share of knowledge in history, and the laws and constitution of my country, than is generally attained by men of my class, many of them not being so fortunate as I have been in the opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of getting information.</p>
               <p>From infancy I was taught to love huma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity and liberty. Inquiry and experience have since confirmed my reverence for the lessons then given me, by convincing me more fully of their truth and excellence. Benevolence towards mankind excites wishes for their welfare, and such wishes endear the means of fulfilling them. Those can be found in liberty alone, and therefore her sacred cause ought to be espoused by every man, on every occasion, to the utmost of his power: as a charitable but poor per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son does not withold his <hi>mite,</hi> because he cannot relieve <hi>all</hi> the distresses of the mise<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable, so let not any honest man suppress his sentiments concerning freedom, however small their influence is likely to be. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps he may "<note n="(a)" place="bottom">POPE.</note> touch some wheel" that will have an effect greater that he expects.</p>
               <p>These being my sentiments, I am encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raged to offer to you, my countrymen, my thoughts on some late transactions, that in
<pb n="7" facs="unknown:010876_0005_0F851FB57A0FD0B8"/>
my opinion are of the utmost importance to you. Conscious of my defects, I have wait<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed some time, in expectation of seeing the subject treated by persons much better qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lified for the task; but being therein disap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed, and apprehensive that longer delays will be injurious, I venture at length to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quest the attention of the public, praying only for one thing,—that is, that these lines may be <hi>read</hi> with the same zeal for the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piness of British America, with which they were <hi>wrote.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>With a good deal of surprise I have ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>served, that little notice has been taken of an act of parliament, as injurious in its principle to the liberties of these colonies, as the STAMP-ACT was: I mean the act for sus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pending the legislation of New-York.</p>
               <p>The assembly of that government com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied with a former act of parliament, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiring certain provisions to be made for the troops in America, in every particular, I think, except the articles of salt, pepper, and vinegar. In my opinion they acted imprudently, considering all circumstances, in not complying so far, as would have given satisfaction, as several colonies did: but my dislike of their conduct in that instance, has not blinded me so much, th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                     <desc>••</desc>
                  </gap> I cannot plainly perceive, that they have been punished in a manner pernicious to American freedom, and justly alarming to all the colonies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="8" facs="unknown:010876_0006_0F851FB62568D010"/>If the BRITISH PARLIAMENT has a legal authority to order, that we shall fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nish a single article for the troops here, and to compel obedience to that order; they have the same right to order us to supply those troops with arms, cloaths, and every necessary, and to compel obedience to that order also; in short, to lay <hi>any burdens</hi> they please upon us. What is this but <hi>taxing</hi> us at a <hi>certain sum,</hi> and leaving to us only the <hi>manner</hi> of raising it? How is this mode more tolerable than the STAMP ACT? Would that act have appeared more pleasing to AMERICANS, if being ordered thereby to raise the sum total of the taxes, the mighty privilege had been left to them, of saying how much should be paid for an instrument of writing on paper, and how much for another on parchment?</p>
               <p>An act of parliament commanding us to do a certain thing, if it has any validity, is a tax upon us for the expence that accrues in complying with it, and for this reason, I believe, every colony on the continent, that chose to give a mark of their respect for GREAT-BRITAIN, in complying with the act relating to the troops, cautiously avoided the mention of that act, lest their conduct should be attributed to its supposed obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.</p>
               <p>The matter being thus stated, the assembly of <hi>New-York</hi> either had, or had not a right to refuse submission to that act. If they
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:010876_0007_0F851FB6E118CB28"/>
had, and I imagine no AMERICAN will say, they had not, then the parliament had no <hi>right</hi> to compel them to execute it.—If they had not <hi>that right,</hi> they had <hi>no right</hi> to punish them for not executing it; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore had <hi>no right</hi> to suspend their legislation, which is a punishment. In fact, if the people of <hi>New-York</hi> cannot be legally taxed but by their own representatives, they can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be legally deprived of the privileges of making laws, only for insisting on that ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusive privilege of taxation. If they may be legally deprived in such a case of the privilege of making laws, why may they not, with equal reason, be deprived of every other privilege? Or why may not every colony be treated in the same manner, when any of them shall dare to deny their assent to any impositions that shall be di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rected? Or what signifies the repeal of the STAMP-ACT, if these colonies are to lose their <hi>other</hi> privileges, by not tamely sur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rendering that of <hi>taxation?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>There is one consideration arising from this suspicion, which is not generally attended to, but shews it's importance very clearly. It was not <hi>necessary</hi> that this suspension should be caused by an act of parliament. The crown might have restrained the governor of <hi>New-York,</hi> even from calling the assembly toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, by its prerogative in the royal govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments. This step, I suppose, would have
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:010876_0008_0F851FB7A02BB7C0"/>
been taken, if the conduct of the assembly of <hi>New-York,</hi> had been regarded as an act of disobedience <hi>to the crown alone:</hi> but it is regarded as an act of
<q>disobedience to the authority of the BRITISH LEGISLA<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>TURE.</q>
This gives the suspension a consequence vastly more affecting. It is a parliamentary assertion of the <hi>supreme autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity</hi> of the <hi>British legislature</hi> over these colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies in <hi>the part of taxation;</hi> and is intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to COMPEL <hi>New-York</hi> unto a submission to that authority. It seems therefore to me as much a violation of the liberty of the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of that province, and consequently of all these colonies, as if the parliament had sent a number of regiments to be quartered upon them till they should comply. For it is evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, that the suspension is meant as a com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulsion; and the <hi>method</hi> of compelling is to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tally indifferent. It is indeed probable, that the sight of red coats, and the beating of drums would have been most alarming, because people are generally more influenced by their eyes and ears than by their reason: But who<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever seriously considers the matter, must perceive, that a dreadful stroke is aimed at the liberty of these colonies: For the cause of <hi>one</hi> is the cause of <hi>all.</hi> If the parliament may lawfully deprive <hi>New-York</hi> of any of its rights, it may deprive any, or all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther colonies of their rights; and nothing can possibly so much encourage such at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tempts, as a mutual inattention to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terst
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:010876_0009_0F851FB8667BDA38"/>
of eath other. <hi>To divide, and thus to destroy,</hi> is the first political maxim in attack<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing those who are powerful by their union. He certainly is not a wise man, who folds his arms and reposeth himself at home, seeing with unconcern the flames that have invaded his neighbour's house, without any endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vours to extinguish them. When Mr. <hi>Hamp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den's</hi> ship money cause, for three shillings and four-pence, was tried, all the people of <hi>England,</hi> with anxious expectation, interest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed themselves in the important decision; and when the slightest point touching the free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom of a single colony is agitated, I earnest<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly wish, that all the rest may with equal ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dour support their sister. Very much may be said on this subject, but I hope, more at present is unnecessary.</p>
               <p>With concern I have observed that two assemblies of this province have sat and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>journed, without taking any notice of this act. It may perhaps be asked, what would have been proper for them to do? I am by no means fond of inflammatory measures. I detest them.—I should be sorry that any thing should be done which might justly dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>please our sovereign or our mother-country. But a firm, modest exertion of a free spirit, should never be wanting on public occasions. It appears to me, that it would have been sufficient for the assembly, to have ordered our agents to represent to the King's mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters, their sense of the suspending act, and
<pb n="12" facs="unknown:010876_0010_0F851FB92CEB38C8"/>
to pray for its repeal. Thus we should have borne our testimony against it; and might therefore reasonably expect that on a like occasion, we might rec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </opener>
               <p>THERE is another late act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, which seems to me to be as destructive to the liberty of these colonies, as that inserted in my last letter; that is, the act for granting the duties on paper, glass, &amp;c. It appears to me to be uncon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutional.</p>
               <p>The parliament unquestionably possesses a legal authority to <hi>regulate</hi> the trade of <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> and all its colonies. Such an authority is essential to the relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a mother country and its colonies; and necessary for the common good of all. He, who considers these provinces as states distinct from the <hi>British Empire,</hi> has very slender notions of <hi>justice,</hi> or of <hi>their interests.</hi> We are but parts of <hi>a whole</hi>; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore there must exist a power somewhere, to preside, and preserve the connection in due order. This power is lodged in the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; and we are as much dependant on <hi>Great-Britain,</hi> as a perfectly free people can be on another.</p>

                     <p>For the satisfaction of the reader, recitals from former acts of parliament relating to these colonies are added. By comparing these with the modern acts, he will perceive their great difference in expression and intention.</p>
                     <p>The 12th Cha. II Chap. 18, which forms the founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the laws relating to our trade, by enacting that certain productions of the colonies shall be carried to England only, and that no goods shall be imported from the plantations but in ships belonging to England, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Wales, Berwick, or the Plantations, &amp;c. begins thus:
"For the increase of shipping, and encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the navigation of this nation, wherein, under the good providence and protection of God, the wealth, safety, and strength of this kingdom is so much concerned," &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The 15th Cha. II. Chap. 7. enforcing the same regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation, assigns these reasons for it.
"In regard his Majesty's plantations, beyond the seas, are inhabited and peopled by his subjects of this his kingdom of England; for the maintaining a greater correspondence and kind<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ness between them, and keeping them in a firmer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendence upon it, and rendering them yet more bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial and advantageous unto it, in the further employ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and increase of English shipping and seamen, vent of English woolen, and other manufactures and com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities, rendering the navigation to and from the same more safe and cheap, and making this kingdom a staple, not only of the commodities of those planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, but also of the commodities of other countries and places for the supplying of them; and it being the usage of other nations to keep their plantations trade to themselves," &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The 25th Cha. II. Chap. 7, made expressly "for the better securing the plantation trade," which imposes duties on certain commodities exported from one colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny to another, mentions this last for imposing them: "Whereas by one act passed in the 12th year of your Majesty's reign, intitled, an act for encouragement of shipping and navigation, and by several other laws, pas<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed since that time, it is permitted to ship, &amp;c. sugars, tobacco, &amp;c. of the growth, &amp;c. of any of your Maje<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sty's plantations in America &amp;c. from the places of their growth, &amp;c. to any other of your Majesty's plan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations in those parts, &amp;c. and that without paying of custom for the same, either at the lading or unlanding the said commodities, by means whereof the trade and navigation in those commodities from one planta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to another is greatly encreased, and the inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of divers of those colonies, not contenting them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves with being supplied with those commodities for their own use, free from all customs (while the subjects of this your kingdom of England have paid great customs and impositions for wh<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The 7th and 8th Will. III. Chap. 21, intitled,
"An act for preventing frauds, and regulating abuses in the plantation trade,"
recites that,
"notwithstanding diverse acts, &amp;c. great abuses are daily committed, to the prejudice of the English navigation, and the loss of a great part of the plantation trade to this kingdom, by the artifice and cunning of ill disposed persons: for re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>medy whereof, &amp;c. And whereas in some of his Majes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty's American plantations, a doubt or misconstruction has arisen upon the before mentioned acts, made in the 25th year of the reign of Charles II. whereby cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain duties are laid upon the commodities therein enu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merated (which by law may be transported from one plantation to another, for the supplying of each others wants) as if the same were, by the payment of those duties in one plantation, discharged from giving the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curities intended by the aforesaid acts, made in the 12th 22d and 23d years of the reign of King Charles II. and consequently be at liberty to go to any foreign market in Europe," &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The 6th Anne, Chap. 37, reciting the advancement of trade, &amp;c. and encouragement of ships of war, &amp;c. grants to the captors the property of all prizes carried into A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merica, subject to such customs and duties, &amp;c. as if the same had been first imported into any part of Great-Britain, and from thence exported, &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>This was a gift to persons acting under commissions from the crown, and therefore it was reasonable that the terms prescribed should be complied with—more especially as the payment of such duties was intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to give a preference to the productions of the British colonies, over those of other colonies. However, being found inconvenient to the colonies, about four years af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terwards, this act was, for that reason, so far repealed, by another act
<q>all prize goods, imported into a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny part of Great-Britain, from any of the plantations, were liable to such duties only in Great-Britain, as in case they had been of the growth and produce of the plantations.</q> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>The 6th Geo. II. Chap. 13, which imposes duties on foreign rum, sugar and molasses, imported into the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies, shews the reason thus.—
"Whereas the welfare and prosperity of your Majesty's sugar colonies in Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rica, are of the greatest consequence and importance to the trade, n<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     <p>The 29th Geo. II. Chap. 26. and the 1st Geo. III. Chap. 9. which contains 6th Geo. II. Chap. 13, declare, that the said act hath, by experience, been found useful and beneficial. &amp;c. These are all the most considerable statutes relating to the commerce of the colonies; and it is thought to be utterly unnecessary to add any obser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vations to these extracts, to prove that they were all in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended solely as regulations of trade.</p>

and though many of them imposed du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties on trade, yet those duties were always imposed <hi>with design</hi> to restrain the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merce of one part, that was injurious to ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and thus to promote the general wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare.

Mr. <hi>Green<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville</hi>'s sagacity first introduced this language, in the preamble to the 4th of Geo. III. Ch. 15, which has these words—
"And whereas it is just and necessary that A REVENUE BE RAISED IN YOUR MAJESTY'S SAID DOMI<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ONS IN AMERICA, <hi>for defraying the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pences of defending, protecting, and securing the same:</hi> We your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, THE COMMONS OF GREAT BRITAIN, in parliament assembled,
<pb n="18" facs="unknown:010876_0016_0F851FC2B8BEA450"/>
being desirous to make some provision in the present session of parliament, towards raising the said revenue in America, have resolved to give and grant unto your Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty the several rates and duties herein after mentioned," &amp;c.</p>
               <p>A few months after came the <hi>Stamp-act,</hi> which reciting this, proceeds in the same strange mode of expression, thus—
"And whereas it is just and necessary, that pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision be made FOR RAISING A FURTHER REVE<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>NUE WITHIN YOUR MAJESTY's DOMINIONS IN AME<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>RICA, towards defraying the said expences, we your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects, the COMMONS OF GREAT-BRITAIN, &amp;c. GIVE and GRANT," &amp;c. as before.</p>
               <p>The last act, granting duties upon paper, &amp;c. carefully pursues these modern prece<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dents. The preamble is,
"Whereas it is expedient that a revenue should be raised in your Majesty's dominions in America, for making a more certain and adequate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for the defraying the charge of the administration of justice, and the support of civil government in such provinces, where it shall be found necessary; and towards the further defraying the expences of de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fending, protecting and securing the said do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minions, we your Majesty's most dutiful and loyal subjects, the COMMONS OF GREAT-BRITAIN, &amp;c. give and grant," &amp;c. as before.</p>
               <p>Here we may observe an authority <hi>expresly</hi> claimed to impose duties on these colonies;
<pb n="19" facs="unknown:010876_0017_0F851FC35F95A5C8"/>
not for the regulation of trade; not for the preservation or promotion of a mutually beneficial intercourse between the several constituent parts of the empire, heretofore the <hi>sole objects</hi> of parliamentary institutions; <hi>but for the single purpose of levying money upon us.</hi>

Such per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sons attend so much to the idea of exportation, that they entirely drop that of the connection between the mother country and her colonies. If Great-Britain had always claimed, and exercised an authority to compel Spain and Portugal to import manufactures from her only, the ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses would be parallel: But as she never pretended to such a right, they are at liberty to get them where they please; and if they chuse to take them from her, rather than from other nations, they voluntary consent to pay the duties imposed on them.</note> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports, and it makes no difference to us, whether they are paid here or there.</p>
               <p>To this I answer. These colonies require many things for their use, which the laws of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> prohibit them from getting any where but from her. Such are paper and glass.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="20" facs="unknown:010876_0018_0F851FC3A08D8EA0"/>That we <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               </p>
               <p>What is the difference in <hi>substance</hi> and <hi>right,</hi> whether the same sum is raised upon us by the rates mentioned in the Stamp-act, on the <hi>use</hi> of the paper, or by these duties, on the <hi>importation</hi> of it. It is nothing but the edition of a former book, with a new title page.</p>
               <p>Suppose the duties were made payable in <hi>Great-Britain?</hi>
               </p>
               <p>It signifies nothing to us, whether they are to be paid here or there. Had the <hi>Stamp-act</hi> directed, that all the paper should be landed in <hi>Florida,</hi> and the duties paid there, before it was brought to the <hi>British Colonies,</hi> would the act have raised less mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney upon us, or have been less destructive of our rights? By no means: For as we were under a necessity of using the paper, we should have been under the necessity of paying the duties. Thus, in the present case, a like <hi>necessity</hi> will subject us, if this act continues in force, to the payment of the duties now imposed.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="21" facs="unknown:010876_0019_0F851FCE25CAA6F0"/>Why was the <hi>Stamp-act</hi> then so pernicious to freedom? It did not enact, that every man in the colonies <hi>should</hi> buy a certain quantity of paper—No: It only directed, that no instrument of writing should be valid in law, if not made on stamp paper, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The makers of that act knew full well, that the confusions that would arise upon the disuse of writings would COMPEL the colonies to use the stamp paper, and therefore to pay the taxes imposed. For this reason the <hi>Stamp-act</hi> was said to be a law THAT WOULD EXECUTE ITSELF. For the very same reason, the last act of parliament, if it is granted to have any force here, will execute itself, and will be attended with the very same consequences to <hi>American Liberty.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Some persons perhaps may say, that this act lays us under no necessity to pay the du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties imposed, because we may ourselves ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufacture the articles on which they are laid; whereas by the Stamp-act no instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of writing could be good, unless made on British paper, and that too stampt.</p>
               <p>Such an objection amounts to no more than this, that the injury resulting to these colonies, from the total disuse of British pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per and glass, will not be <hi>so afflicting</hi> as that which would have resulted from the total disuse of writing among them; for by that means even the stamp-act might have been eluded. Why then was it universally detes<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted
<pb n="22" facs="unknown:010876_0020_0F851FD0EFD7C998"/>
by them as slavery itself? Because it presented to these devoted provinces nothing but a choice of calamities, imbittered by indignities, each of which it was unworthy of freemen to bear. But is no injury a vi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>olation of right but the <hi>greatest</hi> injury? If the eluding the payment of the duties im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the stamp-act, would have subject<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed us to a more dreadful inconvenience, than the eluding the payment of those imposed by the late act; does it therefore follow, that the last is no violation of our rights, though it is calculated for the same purpose that the other was, that is, <hi>to raise money upon us,</hi> WITHOUT OUR CONSENT?</p>
               <p>This would be making <hi>right</hi> to consist, not in an exemption from <hi>injury,</hi> but from a certain <hi>degree of injury.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But the objectors may further say, that we shall sustain no injury at all by the disuse of British paper and glass. We might not, if we could make as much as we want. But can any man, acquainted with Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca, believe this possible? I am told there are but two or three <hi>glass-houses</hi> on this continent, and but very few <hi>paper-mills</hi>; and suppose more should be erected, a long course of years must elapse, before they can be brought to perfection. This continent is a country of planters, farmers, and fish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ermen; not of manufacturers. The diffi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culty of establishing particular manufactures in such a country, is almost insuperable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  <pb n="23" facs="unknown:010876_0021_0F851FD16FE9D6B0"/>
for one manufacture is connected with o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers in such a manner, that it may be said to be impossible to establish one or two, without establishing several others. The experience of many nations may convince us of this truth.</p>
               <p>Inexpressible therefore must be our di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stresses in evading the late acts, by the dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>use of British paper and glass. Nor will this be the extent of our misfortunes, if we ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit the legality of that act.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Great-Britain</hi> has prohibited the manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facturing iron and steel in these colonies, without any objection being made to her right of doing it. The like right she must have to prohibit any other manufacture a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong us. Thus she is possessed of an undis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted <hi>precedent</hi> on that point. This autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, she will say, is founded on the <hi>original intention</hi> of settling these colonies; that is, that she should manufacture for them, and that they should supply her with materials. The <hi>equity</hi> of this policy, she will also say, has been universally acknowledged by the colonies, who never have made the least ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jection to statutes for that purpose; and will further appear by the <hi>mutual benefits</hi> flowing from this usage, ever since the settlement of these colonies.</p>
               <p>Our great advocate, Mr. PITT, in his speeches on the debate concerning the repeal of the <hi>Stamp-act,</hi> acknowledged, that Great Britain could restrain our manufactures. His
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:010876_0022_0F851FD21A823970"/>
words are these—
"This kingdom, as the supreme governing and legislative power, has <hi>always</hi> bound the colonies by her regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations and <hi>restrictions</hi> in trade, in navigati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, in <hi>manufactures</hi>—in every thing, <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept that of taking their money out of their pockets,</hi> WITHOUT THEIR CONSENT."
A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gain he says, "We may bind their trade, CONFINE THEIR MANUFACTURES, and exercise every power whatever, except that of taking money out of their pockets, WITH<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>OUT THEIR CONSENT.</p>
               <p>Here then, let my countrymen, ROUSE yourselves, and behold the ruin hanging o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their heads. If they ONCE admit, that Great-Britain may lay duties upon her ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portations to us, <hi>for the purpose of levying money on us only,</hi> she then will have nothing to do, but to lay those duties on the arti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cles which she prohibits us to manufacture— and the tragedy of American liberty is finish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. We have been prohibited from procuring manufactures, in all cases, any where but from Great-Britain, (excepting linens, which we are permitted to import directly from Ireland). We have been prohibited, in some cases, from manufacturing for ourselves; We are therefore exactly in the situation of a city besieged, which is surrounded by the works of the besiegers in every part <hi>but one.</hi> If <hi>that</hi> is closed up, no step can be taken, <hi>but to sur<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               </p>
               <p>Perhaps the nature of the necessities of the dependant states, caused by the policy of a governing one, for her own benefit, may be elucidated by a fact mentioned in history. When the Carthaginians were possessed of the island of Sardinia, they made a decree, that the Sardinians should not get corn, any other way than from the Carthaginians. Then, by imposing any duties they would, they drained from the miserable Sardini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans any sums they pleased; and whenever that oppressed people made the least move<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to assert their liberty, their tyrants starved them to death or submission. This may be called the most perfect kind of po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>litical necessity.</p>
               <p>From what has been said, I think this un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>controvertible conclusion may be deduced, that when a ruling state obliges a dependant state to take certain commodities from her alone, it is implied in the nature of that obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation; and is essentially requisite to give it the least degree of justice; and is inseparably
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:010876_0024_0F851FD391CF1CD0"/>
united with it, in order to preserve any share of freedom to the dependant state; that those commodities should never be loaded with duties for the sole purpose of levying money on the dependant state.</p>
               <p>The place of paying the duties imposed by the late act, appears to me therefore to be tot<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <opener>
                  <salute>Beloved Countrymen,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I REJOICE to find, that my two former letters to you, have been generally re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived with so much favour by such of you whose sentiments I have had an opportunity of knowing. Could you look into my heart, you would instantly perceive an ardent affec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for your persons, a zealous attachment to your interests, a lively resentment of e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very insult and injury offered to your honour or happiness, and an inflexible resolution to assert your rights, to the utmost of my weak power, to be the only motives that have engaged me to address you.</p>
               <p>I am no further concerned in any thing affecting America, than any one of you, and when liberty leaves it I can quit it much more conveniently than most of you: but while divine providence, that gave me exis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence in a land of freedom, permits my head to think, my lips to speak, and my hand to move, I shall so highly and grate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fully value the blessing received, as to take care that my silence and inactivity shall not give my implied assent to any act degrading my brethren and myself from the birthright
<pb n="28" facs="unknown:010876_0026_0F851FD503D4CA08"/>
wherewith heaven itself "<hi>hath made us free.</hi>
                  <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Gal. v.1.</note>"</p>
               <p>Sorry I am to learn, that there are some few persons, shake their heads with solemn motion, and pretend to wonder what can be the meaning of these letters.
"Great-Britain, they say, is too powerful to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend with; she is determined to oppress us; it is in vain to speak of right on one side, when there is power on the other; when we are strong enough to resist, we shall attempt it; but now we are not strong enough, and therefore we had better be quiet; it signi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies nothing to convince us that our rights are invaded, when we cannot defend them, and if we should get into riots and tumults about the late act, it will only draw down heavier displeasure upon us."</p>
               <p>What can such men design? What do their grave observations amount to, but this —
"that these colonies, totally regardless of their liberties, should commit them, with humble resignation, to <hi>chance, time,</hi> and the tender mercies of <hi>ministers.</hi>"</p>
               <p>Are these men ignorant, that usurpations, which might have been successfully opposed at first, acquire strength by continuance, and thus become irresistible? Do they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn the conduct of these colonies, concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the <hi>Stamp-act?</hi> Or have they forgot its successful issue? Ought the colonies at that
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:010876_0027_0F851FD5A7A8E888"/>
time, instead of acting as they did, to have trusted for relief, to the fortuitous events of futurity? If it is needless "to speak of rights" now, it was as needless then. If the behaviour of the colonies was prudent and glorious then, and successful too; it will be equally prudent and glorious to act in the same manner now, if our rights are equal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly invaded, and may be as successful. Therefore it becomes necessary to enquire, whether "our rights <hi>are</hi> invaded." To talk of "defending" them, as if they could be no otherwise "defended" than by arms, is as much out of the way, as if a man having a choice of several roads to reach his journey's end, should prefer the worst, for no other reason, than because it is the worst.</p>
               <p>As to "riots and tumults," the gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men who are so apprehensive of them, are much mistaken, if they think, that grievan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces cannot be redressed without such assist<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance.</p>
               <p>I will now tell the gentlemen, what is "the meaning of these letters." <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 span">

                  </gap> these colonies, that they are at this moment exposed to the most imminent dangers; and to persuade them immediately, vigourously, and unanimously, to exert themselves, in the most firm, but most peaceable manner for obtaining relief.</p>
               <p>The cause of liberty is a cause of too much dignity, to be sullied by turbulence
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:010876_0028_0F851FD667562120"/>
and tumult. It ought to be maintained in a manner suitable to her nature. Those who engage in it, should breathe a sedate, yet fervent spirit, animating them to actions of prudence, justice, modesty, bravery, hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>manity, and magnanimity.</p>
               <p>To such a wonderful degree were the an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tient <hi>Spartans,</hi> as brave and as free a people as ever existed, inspired by this happy tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perature of soul, that rejecting even in their battles the use of trumpets, and other instru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments for exciting heat and rage, they march<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed up to scenes of havock and horror, with the sound of flutes, to the tunes of which their steps kept pace—
<q>exhibiting, as <hi>Plu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarch</hi> says, at once a terrible and delightful sight, and proceeding with a deliberate valour, full of hope and good assurance, as if some divinity had insensibly assisted them.</q>
               </p>
               <p>I hope, my dear countrymen, that you will in every colony be upon your guard a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst those who may at any time endeavour to stir you up, under pretences of patriotism, to any measures disrespectful to our sovereign and our mother country. Hot, rash, disor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derly proceedings, injure the reputation of a people as to wisdom, valour and virtue, without procuring them the least benefit. I pray God, that he may be pleased to inspire you and your posterity to the latest ages with that spirit, of which I have an idea, but find a difficulty to express: to express in
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:010876_0029_0F851FD72F058578"/>
the best manner I can, I mean a spirit that shall so guide you, that it will be impossible to determine, whether an <hi>American</hi>'s cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter is most distinguishable for his loyalty to his sovereign, his duty to his mother coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try, his love of freedom, or his affection for his native soil.</p>
               <p>Every government, at some time or other, falls into wrong measures; these may pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed from mistake or passion.—But every such measure does not dissolve the obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on between the governors and the governed; the mistake may be corrected; the passion may pass over.</p>
               <p>It is the duty of the governed, to endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vour to rectify the mistake, and appease the passion. They have not at first any other right, than to represent their grievances, and to pray for redress, unless an emergence is so pressing, as not to allow time for receiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an answer to their applications which rarely happens. If their applications are dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>regarded, then that kind of opposition be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes justifiable, which can be made with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out breaking the laws, or disturbing the pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lic peace. This consists in the prevention of the oppressors reaping advantage from their oppressions, and not in their punishment. For experience may teach them what reason did not; and harsh methods, cannot be proper, till milder ones have failed.</p>
               <p>If at length it becomes undoubted, that an inveterate resolution is formed to annihi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late
<pb n="32" facs="unknown:010876_0030_0F851FD7E99E24F0"/>
the liberties of the governed, the English history affords frequent examples of resistance by force. What particular circumstances will in any future case justify such resistance, can never be ascertained till they happen. Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps it may be allowable to say, generally, that it never can be justifiable, until the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple are FULLY CONVINCED, that any fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther submission will be destructive to their happiness.</p>
               <p>When the appeal is made to the sword, highly probable it is, that the punishment will exceed the offence; and the calamities attending on war out weigh those preceding it. These considerations of justice and pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, will always have great influence with good and wise men.</p>
               <p>To these reflections on this subject, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains to be added, and ought for ever to be remembred; that resistance in the case of colonies against their mother country, is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely different from the resistance of a people against their prince. A nation may change their King or race of Kings, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain their antient form of government, be gainers by changing. Thus Great-Britain, under the illustrious house of Brunswick, a house that seems to flourish for the happiness of mankind, has found a felicity, unknown in the reigns of the Stuarts. But if once we are separated from our mother country, what new form of government shall we accept, or when shall we find another Britain to supply
<pb n="33" facs="unknown:010876_0031_0F851FD8CA342308"/>
our loss? Torn from the body to which we are united by religion, liberty, laws, affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, relations, language, and commerce, we must bleed at every vein.</p>
               <p>In truth, the prosperity of these provinces is founded in their dependance on Great-Britain; and when she returns to "her old "good humour, and old good nature," as Lord Clerendon expresses it, I hope they will always esteem it their duty and interest, as it most certainly will be, to promote her welfare by all the means in their power.</p>
               <p>We cannot act with too much caution in our disputes. Anger produces anger; and differences that might be accommodated by kind and respectful behaviour, may by imprudence be changed to an incurable rage.</p>
               <p>In quarrels between countries, as well as in those between individuals, when they have risen to a certain heighth, the first cause of dissention is no longer remembred, the minds of the parties being wholly engaged in re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>collecting and resenting the mutual expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions of their dislike. When feuds have reached that fatal point, all considerations of reason and equity vanish; and a blind fury governs, or rather confounds all things. A people no longer regards their interest, but the gratification of their wrath. The sway of the Cleon's, <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Cleon was a popular firebrand of Athens and Clodius of Rome; each of them plunged his country into the deepest calamities.</note> and Clodius's, the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>signing

                  <salute>Beloved Countrymen,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>AN objection, I hear, has been been made against what I offer in my second let<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, which I would willingly clear up before I proceed.
<q>There is,</q>
say these objec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tors
<q>a material difference between the Stamp-act and the late act for laying a duty on paper, &amp;c. that justifies the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of those who opposed the former, and yet are willing to submit to the lat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter. The duties imposed by the Stamp-act, were internal taxes, but the present are external, which therefore the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment may have a right to impose.</q>
— To this I answer, with a total denial of the power of parliament to lay upon these colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies any tax whatever.</p>
               <p>This point being so important to this and to all succeeding generations, I wish to be clearly understood.</p>
               <p>To the word "Tax," I annex that meaning which the constitution and history of England require to be annexed to it; that it is, an imposition on the subject for the sole purpose of levying money.</p>
               <p>In the early ages of our monarchy, the services rendered to the crown, for the
<pb n="38" facs="unknown:010876_0035_0F851FDBDFDB0398"/>
general good, were personal; <note n="(a)" place="bottom">It is very worthy of remark, how watchful our wise ancestors were, least these services should be extend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed beyond the limits of the law. No man was bound to go out of the realm to serve, and therefore even in the conquering reign of Henry V. when the martial spirit of the nation was inflamed by success to a great degree, they still carefully guarded against the establishment of illegal services. Lord Chief Justice Coke's words are these,
"When this point concerning maintainance of wars out of England came in question, the Commons did make their continual claim of their antient freedom and birth-right, as in the first of Henry V. and 7th of Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry V &amp;c. the Commons made protest that they were not bound to the maintainance of war in Scotland, Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, Calais, France, Normandy, or other foreign parts, and caused their protests to be entered into the parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment roll, where they yet remain; which, in effect, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeth with that, which upon the like occasion was made in the parliament of 25. E. 1."
2d Inst. p. 528.</note> but in pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gress of time, such institutions being found inconvenient, certain gifts and grants of their own property were made by the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, under the several names of aids, tal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lages, talks, taxes, subsidies, &amp;c.
These were made as may be collected even from the names for public service, "upon need and necessity," <note n="(b)" place="bottom">4. Inst. p. 28.</note> all these sums were levied upon the people by virtue of their voluntary gift. <note n="(c)" place="bottom">
                     <p>
                        <hi>Rege Angli<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </p>
                     <p>These gifts entirely depending on the pleasure of the donors, were proportioned to the abilities of the several ranks of people, who gave, and were regulated by their opinion of the public necessities. Thus Edward I. had in his 11th year a thirteenth from the laity, a twentieth from the clergy; in his 22d year, a tenth from the lai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, a sixth from London, and other corporate towns, half of their benefices from the clergy; in his 23d year, an eleventh from the barons and others, a tenth from the clergy, and a seventh from the burgesses, &amp;c.</p>
                     <bibl>Hume's History of England.</bibl>
                     <p>The same difference in the grants of the several ranks, is observable in other reigns. In the famous statute <hi>de tallagio non concedendo,</hi> the King enumerates the se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral classes, without whose consent he and his heirs should never set or levy any tax.
<q>Nullum tallagium vel auxilium, per nos, vel haeredes nostros, in regno nostro ponatur seu levetur, sine voluntare et assensu archiepiscopo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rum, episcoporum, comitum, baronum, militum, burgensi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>um, et aliorum liberorum de regno nostro.</q>

                     <bibl>34 E. 1.</bibl>
                     <p>Lord Chief Justice Coke in his comment on these words, says,
"for the quieting of the Commons, and for a perpetual and constant law for ever after, both in this and other like cases, thi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> act was made."
"These words are plain without scruple; absolute without any sav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing."</p>
                     <bibl>2 Cocke's Inst. p. 522, 523.</bibl>
                     <p>Little did the venerable judge imagine, that "other like cases" would happen, in which the spirit of this law would be despised by Englishmen, the posterity of those who made it.</p>
                  </note> The design of them was to support
<pb n="39" facs="unknown:010876_0036_0F851FDC6CBE3558"/>
the national honour and interest. Some of those grants comprehended duties arising from trade, being imports on merchandizes. These Chief Justice Coke classes "under "subsides" <note n="(d)" place="bottom">4. Inst. p. 28.</note> and "parliamentary aids." They are also called "customs." But whatever the name was, they were always considered as gifts of the people to the crown, to be employed for public uses.</p>
               <p>Commerce was at a low ebb, and most surprising instances may be produced, how little it was attended to, for a succession of ages. The terms that have been mentioned, and among the rest that of "tax," had
<pb n="40" facs="unknown:010876_0037_0F851FDD98828558"/>
obtained a national, parliamentary meaning, drawn from the principles of the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, long before any Englishmen thought of regulations of trade "by imposing duties."</p>
               <p>Whenever we speak of taxes among Englishmen, let us therefore speak of them with reference to the intentions with which, and the principles on which they have been established. This will give certainty to our expression, and safety to our conduct: but if when we have in view the liberty of these colonies, and the influence of "taxes" laid without our consent, we proceed in any other course, we pursue a Juno <note n="(e)" place="bottom">The goddess of empire, in the heathen mytholo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gy. According to an ancient fable, Ixion pursued her, but she escaped by a cloud which she threw in his way.</note> indeed, but shall only catch a cloud.</p>
               <p>In the national parliamentary sense in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted on, the word "tax" <note n="(f)" place="bottom">In this sense Montesquieu uses the word "tax", in his 13th book of Spirit of Laws.</note> was certainly understood by the congress at New-York, whose resolves may be said to form the Ame<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rican "bill of rights." I am satisfied that the congress was of opinion, that no impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions could be legally laid on the people of these colonies for the purpose of levying money, but by themselves or their represen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tatives.</p>
               <p>The third, fourth, fifth, and sixth resolves are thus expressed.</p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="41" facs="unknown:010876_0038_0F851FDDF1947D58"/>III.
"That it is inseperably essential to the freedom of a people and the undoubted right of Englishmen, that no tax be imposed on them, but with their own consent, given personally or by their representatives."</p>
               <p n="4">IV.
"That the people of the colonies are not, and from their local circumstances cannot be represented in the House of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mons, in Great-Britain."</p>
               <p n="5">V.
"That the only representatives of the people of the colonies, are the persons cho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sen therein by themselves; and that no taxes ever have been, or can be constitution<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally imposed on them, but by their respective legislatures."</p>
               <p n="6">VI.
"That all supplies to the crown being free gifts of the people, it is unrea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sonable and inconsistent with the principles and spirit of the British constitution, for the people of Great-Britain to grant to his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jesty the property of the colonies."</p>
               <p>Here is no distinction made, between in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal and external taxes. It is evident from the short reasoning thrown into these resolves that every imposition
<q>to grant to his Majesty the property of the colonies,</q>
was thought a "tax;" and that every such imposition if laid any other way
"but with their consent, given personally, or by their representatives,"
was not only
<q>un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonable, and inconsistent with the prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples and spirit of the British constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</q>
                  <pb n="42" facs="unknown:010876_0039_0F851FDEA473B9E0"/>
but destructive
<q>to the freedom of a people.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This language is clear and important. A "tax" means an imposition to raise money. Such persons therefore as speak of internal and external "taxes," I pray may pardon me, if I object to that expression as applied to the privileges and interests of these colonies. There may be external and internal impositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, founded on different principles, and hav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing different tendencies; every "tax" be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing an imposition, tho' every imposition is not a "tax." But all "taxes" are found<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed on the same principle, and have the same tendency.</p>
               <p>"External impositions for the regulation of our trade, do not grant to his Majesty the property of the colonies."
They only prevent the colonies acquiring property in things not necessary, and in a manner judged to b <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

<q>grants to his Majesty the property of these colonies,</q>
by laying duties on manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures of Great-Britain, which they must take, and which he settled them, in order that they should take.</p>
               <p>What <note n="(g)" place="bottom">
                     <p>It seems to be evident, that Mr. Pitt, in his defence of America, during the debate concerning the repeal of the Stamp-act, by "<hi>internal taxes,</hi>" meant any duties "<hi>for the purpose of raising a revenue;</hi>" and by "<hi>external "taxes,</hi>" meant "<hi>duties imposed for the regulation of trade.</hi>" His expressions are these.—
"If the gentleman does not understand the difference between internal and external taxes, I cannot help it; but there is a plain distinction between taxes levied for the purposes of raising a reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, and duties imposed for the regulation of trade, for the accommodation of the subject; altho' in the conse<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences, some revenue might incidentally arise from the letter."</p>
                     <p>These words were in Mr. Pitt's reply to Mr. Grenville, who said he could not understand the difference between external and internal taxes. But Mr. Pitt in his first speech, had made no such distinction; and hi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> meaning, when he mentions the distinction, appears to be—that by "<hi>external taxes,</hi>" he intended impositions, for the purpose of regulating the intercourse of the colonies with others; and by "<hi>internal taxes,</hi>" he intended im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions, for the purpose of taking money from them.</p>
                     <p>In every other part of his speeches on that occasion, his words confirm this construction of his expressions. The following extracts will show how positive and gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>

"I dare not say how much higher these profits may be augment<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed."—
"Upon the whole, I will beg leave to tell the house what is really my opinion: it is, THAT THE STAMP-ACT BE REPEALED ABSOLUTELY, TOTALLY, AND IMMEDIATELY.

               </opener>
               <p>PERHAPS the objection to the late act, imposing duties upon paper, &amp;c. might have been safely rested on the arguments drawn from the universal conduct of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and ministers, from the first existence of these colonies, to the administration of Mr. Grenville.</p>
               <p>What but the indisputable, the acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged exclusive right of the colonies to tax themselves, could be the reason, that in this long period of more than one hundred and fifty years, no statute was ever passed for the sole purpose of raising a revenue on the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies? And how clear, how cogent must that reason be, to which every parliament and every minister, for so long a time sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted, without a single attempt to innovate?</p>
               <p>England in part of that course of years, and Great Britain, in other parts, was en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gaged in fierce and expensive wars; troubled with some tumultuous and bold parliaments; governed by many daring and wicked mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters; yet none of them ever ventured to to touch the PALLADIUM OF AMERICAN LIBERTY, Ambition, avarice, faction, ty<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ranny, all revered it. Whenever it was ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessary
<pb n="48" facs="unknown:010876_0044_0F85244F620B3D90"/>
to raise money on the colonies, the requisitions of the crown were made, and dutifully complied with. The parliament from time to time regulated their trade, and that of the rest of the empire, to preserve their dependencies, and the connection of the whole in good order.</p>
               <p>The people of Great-Britain in support of their privileges, boast much of their antiqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty. Yet it may well be questioned, if there is a single privilege of a British subject, sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported by longer, more solemn, or more un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>interupted testimony, than the exclusive right of taxation in these colonies. The people of Great-Britain consider that kingdom as the sovereign of these colonies, and would now annex to that sovereignty a prerogative ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of before. How would they bear this, was the case their own? What would they think of a new prerogative claimed by the crown? We may guess what their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct would be from the transports of passi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on into which they fell about the late em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bargo, laid to relieve the most emergent ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessities of state, admitting of no delay; and for which there were numerous precedents. Let our liberties be treated with the same tenderness, and it is all we desire.</p>
               <p>Explicit as the conduct of parliaments, for so many ages, is, to prove that no money can be levied on these colonies, by parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for the purpose of raising a revenue; yet it is not the only evidence in our favour.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="49" facs="unknown:010876_0045_0F85244F9D997808"/>Every one of the most material arguments against the legality of the Stamp-act operates with equal force against the act now object<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to; but as they are well known, it seems unnecessary to repeat them <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>This general one only shall be considered at present. That tho' these colonies are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pendant on Great Britain; and tho' she has a legal power to make laws for preserving that dependance; yet it is not necessary for this purpose, nor essential to the relation be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween a mother-country and her colonies, as was eagerly contended by the advocates for the Stamp-act, that she should raise mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney upon them without their consent.</p>
               <p>Colonies were formerly planted by war<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>like nations, to keep their enemies in awe; to relieve their country overburthened with inhabitants; or to discharge a number of discontented and troublesome citizens. But in more modern ages, the spirit of violence being in some measure, if the expression may be allowed, sheathed in commerce, colonies have been settled by the nations of Europe for the purposes of trade. These purposes were to be attained by the colonies raising for their mother country those things which she did not produce herself; and by supply<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing thems<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lves from her with things they wanted. These were the national objects in the commencement of our colonies, and have been uniformly so in their promotion.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="unknown:010876_0046_0F85245724E85570"/>To answer these grand purposes, perfect liberty was known to be necessary; all his<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The parent country with undeviating pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence and virtue, attentive to the first prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciples of colonization, drew to herself the benefits she might reasonably expect, and preserved to her children the blessings, on which those benefits were founded. She made laws obliging her colonies to carry to her all those products which she wanted for her own use; and all those raw materials which she chose herself to work up. Besides this restriction, she forbad them to procure manufactures from any other part of the globe; or even the products of European countries, which alone could rival her, without being first brought to her. In short, by a variety of laws, she regulated their trade in such a manner, as she thought most conducive to their mutual advantage, and her own welfare. A power was reserved to the crown of repealing any laws that should be enacted. The executive authority of government was all lodged in the crown and its representatives; and an appeal was secured to the crown from all judgments in the administration of justice.</p>

               <p>If any person cannot conceive the supre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>macy of Great-Britain to exist, without the power of laying taxes to levy money upon us, the history of the colonies and of Great-Britain since their settlement will prove the contrary. He will there find the amazing

"that not more than fifty families are maintained in England by the refining of sugar."

                     <p>Force can never be used effectually to answer the end, without destroying the colonies themselves. Liberty and encouragement are necessary to carry people thither, and to keep the<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>IT may perhaps be objected against the ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guments that have been offered to the public concerning the legal power of the parliament, that it has always exercised the power of imposing duties for the purposes of raising a revenue on the productions of these colonies carried to Great-Britain, which may be called a tax on them. To this I I answer; that is no more a violation of the rights of the colonies, than their being or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered to carry certain of their productions to Great-Britain, which is no violation at all; it being implied in the relation between them, that the colonies should not carry such com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modities to other nations, as should enable them to interfere with the mother country. The duties imposed on these commodities when brought to her, are only a consequence of her paternal right; and if the point is thoroughly examined, will be found to be laid on the people of the mother country, and not at all dangerous to the liberties of the colonies. Whatever these duties are, they must proportionably raise the price of the goods, and consequently the duties must be paid by the consumers. In this light they were
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:010876_0056_0F85245F6ADD57C8"/>
considered by the parliament in the 25 Char. II. Chap. 7. sec. 2. which says, that the pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ductions of the plantations were carried from one to another free from all customs,
<q>while the subjects of this your kingdom of Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land have paid great customs and impo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sitions for what of them have been spent here &amp;c.</q>
Such duties therefore can ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver be injurious to the liberties of the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies.</p>
               <p>Besides, if Great-Britain exports these commodities again, the duties will injure her own trade, so that she cannot hurt us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out plainly and immediately hurting herself; and this is our check against her acting arbi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tarily in this respect,</p>

                           </gap>t that ever im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed duties on the importations in America, for the express purpose of raising a revenue there, I answer, first, that tho' that act expressly mentions the raising a revenue in America, yet it seems that it had as much in view, "the improving and securing the trade between the same and Great-Britain,"
which words are part of its title, and the preamble says,
"Whereas it is ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pedient that new pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">
                              <desc>••</desc>

Secondly, all the duties mentioned in that act, are imposed sole<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on the productions and manufactures of foreign countries, and not a single duty laid on any producti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on or manufacture of our mother country. Thirdly, the authority of the provincial assemblies is not therein so plainly attacked, as by the last act, which makes pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision for defraying the charges of the administration of justice, and the support of civil government. 4thly, That it being doubtful whether the intention of the 4th Geo. III. ch. 15, was not as much to regulate trade as to raise a revenue, the minds of the people here were wholly engrossed by the terror of the Stamp-act, then impending over them, about the intention of which they could be in no doubt.</q>

                     <p>
                        <q>These reasons so far distinguish 4th Geo. III. ch. 15, from the last act, that it is not to be wondered at, that the first should have been submitted to, though the last should excite the most universal and spirited oppositi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on.

                     </p>
                  </note> may, perhaps, be further objected,
<q>that it being granted that statutes made
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:010876_0057_0F8524601E6017B0"/>
for regulating trade are binding upon us, it will be difficult for any persons but the makers of the laws to determine, which of them are made for the regulating of trade, and which for raising a revenue; and that from hence may arise confusion.</q>
               </p>
               <p>To this I answer, that the objection is of no force in the present case, or such as re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semble it, because the act now in question is formed expressly for the sole purpose of raising a revenue.</p>
               <p>However, supposing the design of the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament had not been expressed, the objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on seems to me of no weight, with regard to the influence, which those who may make
<pb n="62" facs="unknown:010876_0058_0F852460EA32B430"/>
it, might expect it ought to have on the conduct of the colonies.</p>
               <p>It is true, that impositions for raising a revenue, may be hereafter called regulations of trade, but names will not change the na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture of things. Indeed we ought firmly to believe, what is an undoubted truth, confirm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the unhappy experience of many states heretofore free, that unless the most watch<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful attention be exerted, a new servitude may be slipped upon us under the sanction of usual and respectable terms.</p>
               <p>Thus the Caesars ruined Roman liberty, under the titles of tribunical and dictatorial authorities,—old and venerable dignities, known in the most flourishing times of free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. In imitation of the same policy, James II. when he meant to establish popery, talk<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed of liberty of conscicence, the most sacred of all liberties; and had thereby almost de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived the dissenters into destruction.</p>
               <p>All artful rulers, who strive to extend their own power beyond its just limits, endeavour to give to their attempts, as much semblance of legality as possible. Those who succeed them may venture to go a little farther; for each new encroachment will be strengthened by a former, <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Tacitus.</note>

and thus sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port fresh usurpations.</p>

                  <pb n="63" facs="unknown:010876_0059_0F852461AC9DEBB8"/>A free people, therefore, can never be too quick in observing, nor too firm in op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posing the beginnings of alterations, either in form or reality, respecting institutions formed for their security. The first leads to the last; on the other hand nothing is more certain, than that forms of liberty may be retained, when the substance is gone. In government as well as in religion,

               <p>I will beg leave to enforce this remark by a few instances. The crown, by the constitu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, has the prerogative of creating peers; the existence of that order in due number and dignity, is essential to the constitution; and if the crown did not exercise that pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative, the peerage must have long since decreased so much, as to have lost its proper influence. Suppose a prince for some unjust purposes, should from time to time advance many needy pro<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>igate wretches, to that rank, that all the independance of the house of Lords should be destroyed, there would then be a manifest violation of the constituti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, under the appearance of using legal pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rogative.</p>
               <p>The house of Commons claim the privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege of forming all money-bills, and will not suffer either of the other branches of the legislature to add to or alter them; contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing that their power, simply extends to an
<pb n="64" facs="unknown:010876_0060_0F85246275697A28"/>
acceptance or rejection of them. This privi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lege appears to be just; but under pretence of this just privilege, the house of Commons has claimed a licence of tacking to money bills, clauses relating many things of a total<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly different kind, and have thus forced them, in a manner, on the crown and lords. This seems to be an abuse of that privilege, and it may be vastly more abused. Suppose a future house; influenced by some displaced discontented demagogues, in a time of dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, should tack to a money bill something so injurious to the king and peers, that they would not assent to it and yet the Commons should obstinately insist on it; the whole king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom would be exposed to ruin, <hi>under the ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance of maintaining a valuable privilege.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In these cases it might be difficult for a while to determine, whether the King in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended to exercise his prerogative in a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stitutional manner or not; or whether the Commons insisted on the demand factitiously, or for the public good: But surely the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the crown, or of the house, would in time sufficiently explain itself.</p>
               <p>Ought not the people therefore to watch to observe facts? to search into causes? to investigate designs? and have they not a right of judging from the evidence before them, on no slighter points than their liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and happiness?

               <p>I will now apply what has been said to the present question The nature of any im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions laid by parliament on the colonies, must determine the design in laying them. It may not be easy in every instance to dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover that design. Whenever it is doubtful, I think submission cannot be dangerou<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>; nay, it must be right: for, in my opinion, there is no privilege the colonies claim, which they ought, in duty and prudence, more earnestly to maintain and defend, than the authority of the British parliament to regu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>late the trade of all her dominions. Without this authority, the benefits she enjoys from our commerce, must be lost to her: The blessings we enjoy from our dependance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on her, must be lost to us; her strength must decay; her glory vanish; and she cannot suf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer, without our partaking in her misfortune. —
<q>Let us therefore cherish her interest as our own, and give her every thing that it becomes FREEMEN to give or to receive.</q>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>nature</hi> of any impositions she may lay upon us, may in general be known, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sidering how far they relate to the preserv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in due order, the connexion between the
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:010876_0062_0F852463E5975250"/>
several parts of the <hi>British</hi> empire. One thing we may be assured of, which is this; when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever a statute imposes duties on commodities, to be paid only upon their exportation from Great-Britain to these colonies, it is not a regulation of trade, but a design to raise revenue upon us. Other instances may hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pen, which it may not be necessary to dwell on. I hope these colonies will never, to their latest existence, want understanding suffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ent to discover the intentions of those who rule over them, nor the resolution necessary for asserting their interests. They will al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways have the same right that all free states have, of judging when their privileges are invaded, and of using all prudent measures for preserving them.</p>

               <p>Some of you perhaps, filled as I know your breasts are with loyalty to our most excellent prince, and with love to our dear mother country, may feel yourselves inclined by the affections of your hearts, to approve every action of those whom you so much venerate and esteem.</p>
               <p>A prejudice thus flowing from goodness of disposition is amiable indeed. I wish it could be indulged without danger. Did I think this possible, the error should have been adopted, not opposed by me. But in truth, all men are subject to the passions and frailties of nature; and therefore whatever re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard we entertain for the persons of those who govern us, we should always remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber

For the assent of the crown and peers to law seems, as far as I am able to judge, to have been vested in them, more for their own security than for any other purpose. On the other hand, it is the particular business of the people to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quire and discover what regulations are use<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful for themselves, and to digest and present them in the form of bills to the other orders, to have them enacted into laws—Where these laws are to bind themselves, it may be expected that the house of Commons will very carefully consider them: But when they are making laws, that are not designed to bind themselves, we cannot imagine that their deliberations will be as cautious and scrupulous as in their own case. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                     <p>Many remarkable instances might be produced of the extraordinary inattention with which bills of great importance, concerning these colonies, have passed in parliament; which is owing, as it is supposed, to the bills being brought in by the persons who have points to carry, so artfully framed, that it is not easy for the memb<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>rs in general, in the haste of business, to disco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver their tendency.</p>
                     <p>The following instances shew the truth of this remark. W<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>en M. Grenville, in the violence of reformation and innovation, formed the 4th Geo. III. chap 15th, for regulating the American trade, the word "Ireland" was d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>opt in the clause relating to our iron and lumber, so that we could not send these articles to no other part of Europe, but to Great-Britain. This was so unreason<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able a restriction, and so contrary to the sentiments of the legislature, for many years before, that it is surpris<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it should not have been taken notice of in the house. However the bill passed into a law. But when the mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter was explained, this restriction was taken off in a sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequent act.</p>
                     <p>I cannot positively say, how long after the taking off this restriction, as I have not the acts; but I think in less than eighteen months, another act of parliament passed, in which the word "Ireland," was left out as it had been before. The matter being a second time explain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, was a second time regulated.</p>
                     <p>Now if it be considered, that the omission mentioned struck off, with one word, so very great a part of our trade, it must appear remarkable: and equally so is the method by which rice became an enumerated commodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty, and therefore could be carried to Great-Britain only.</p>
                     <p>"The enumeration was obtained, (says Mr. Gee <note n="*" place="bottom">Gee on trade, p. 32.</note>) by one Cole, a Captain of a ship, employed by a company then trading to Carolina; for several ships going from England thither and purchasing rice for Portugal, pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented the aforesaid Captain of a loading. Upon his coming home, he possessed one Mr. Lowndes, a member of parliament, (who was very frequently employed to prepare bills) with an opinion, that carrying rice direct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly to Portugal was a prejudice to the trade of England, and privately got a clause into an act to make it an e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerated commodity; by which means he secured a freight to himself. But the consequence proved a vast loss to the nation."</p>
                     <p>I find that this clause "privately got into an act<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>" for the benefit of Capt. Cole, to the vast loss of the nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on," is foisted into the 3d Anne, chap. 5. intituled,
<q>An act for granting to her Majesty a further subsidy on wines and merchandizes imported,</q>
with which it has no more connexion, than with 34th Edw. I. 34th and 35th of Henry VIII. or the 25th of Car. II. which provide that no person shall be taxed but by himself or his representative.</p>
                  </note>

               <p>
                  <pb n="69" facs="unknown:010876_0065_0F852467BA3D2E00"/>I am told that there is a wonderful ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dress frequently used in carrying points in the house of commons, by persons experien<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced in these affairs—that opportunities are watched—and sometimes votes are past, that if all the members had been present, would
<pb n="70" facs="unknown:010876_0066_0F8524685E058C00"/>
have been rejected by a great majority. Certain it is, that when a powerful and art<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful man has determined on any measure a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainst these colonies, he has always succeed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in his attempt. Perhaps therefore it will be proper for us, whenever any oppres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive act affecting us is past, to attribute it to the inattention of the members of the house of commons, and to the malevolence or ambition of some factious great man, rather than to any other cause.</p>
               <p>Now I do verily believe, that the late act of parliament imposing duties on paper, &amp;c. was formed by Mr. Grenville and his party, because it is evidently a part of that plan, by which be endeavoured to render himself popular at home; and I do also believe that not one half of the members of the house of commons, even of those who heard it read, did perceive how destructive it was to American freedom.</p>
               <p>For this reason, as it is usual in Great-Britain, to consider the King's speech, as the speech of the ministry, it may be right here to consider this act as the act of a party. —Perhaps I should speak more properly if I was to use another term.—</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="71" facs="unknown:010876_0067_0F85246E1CC65928"/>There are two ways of laying taxes.— One is by imposing a certain sum on parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular kinds of property, to be paid by the user or consumer, or by taxing the person at a certain sum; the other is, by imposing a certain sum on particular kinds of property to be paid by the seller.</p>
               <p>When a man pays the first sort of tax, he knows with certainty that he pays so much money for a tax. The confideration for which he pays it is remote, and it may be does not occur to him. He is sensible too that he is commanded and obliged to pay it as a tax; and therefore people are apt to be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleased with this sort of tax.</p>
               <p>The other sort of tax is submitted to in a very different manner. The purchaser of any article very seldom reflects that the seller raises his price so as to indemnify him for the tax he has paid. He knows the prices of things are continually fluctuating, and if he thinks about the tax, he thinks at the same time in all probability, that he might have paid as much, if the article he buys had not been taxed. He gets some<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing visible and agreeable for his money, and tax and price are so confounded toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, that he cannot seperate, or does not chuse to take the trouble of seperating them.</p>
               <p>This mode of taxation therefore is the mode suited to arbitrary and oppressive go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernments. The love of liberty is so natural
<pb n="72" facs="unknown:010876_0068_0F85246ED3C2DE50"/>
to the human heart, that unfeeling tyrants think themselves obliged to accommodate their schemes as much as they can to the appearance of justice and reason, and to deceive those whom they resolve to destroy or oppress, by presenting to them a misera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble picture of freedom, when the inestimable original is lost.</p>
               <p>This policy did not escape the cruel and rapacious Nero. That monster, apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sive that his crimes might endanger his au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority and life, thought proper to do some popular acts to secure the obedience of his subjects. Among other things, says <note n="(b)" place="bottom">Tacitus's An. b. 13. s. 31.</note> Tacitus,
<q>he remitted the twenty-fifth part of the price on the sale of slaves, but rather in shew than reality; for the seller being ordered to pay it, it became a part of the price to the buyer.</q>
               </p>
               <p>This is the reflection of the judicious his<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>torian: but the deluded people gave their infamous emperor full credit for his false generosity. Other nations have been treated in the same manner the Romans were. The honest industrious Germans who are settled in different parts of this continent can in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>form us, that it was this sort of tax that drove them from their native land to our woods, at that time the seats of perfect and undisturbed freedom.</p>
               <p>Their princes inflamed by the lust of power and the lust of avarice, two furies,
<pb n="73" facs="unknown:010876_0069_0F85247150EF5F78"/>
that the more hungery they grow, transgres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sed the bounds they ought in regard to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves to have observed. To keep up the decep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion in the minds of subjects
"there must be,"
says a very learned author <note n="(d)" place="bottom">Montesquieu's spirit of laws, b. 13. chap. 8.</note>
"some proportion between the impost and the value of the commodity; wherefore there ought not to be an excessive duty upon merchan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dizes of little value. There are countries in which the duty exceeds seventeen or eigh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teen times the value of the commodity. In this case the prince removes the illusion. His subjects plainly see they are dealt with in an unreasonable manner, which renders them most exquisitely sensible of their slavi<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>h situation."</p>
               <p>From hence it appears that subjects may be ground down into misery by this sort of taxation as well as the other. They may be as much impoverished if their money is taken from them in this way, as in the other; and that it will be taken, may be more evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent, by attending to a few more considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions.</p>
               <p>The merchant, or importer who pays the duty at first, will not consent to be so much money out of pocket. He, therefore, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portionably raises the price of his goods. It may then be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>id to be a contest between him and the person offering to buy, who shall lose the duty. This must be decided by the nature of the commodities and the purchasers demand for them. If they are
<pb n="74" facs="unknown:010876_0070_0F8524716A918988"/>
mere luxuries, he is at liberty to do as he pleases, and if he buys, he does it voluntari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly: But if they are absolute necessaries, or conveniencies which use and custom have made requisite for the comfort of life, and which he is not permitted, by the power imposing the duty, to get elsewhere, there the seller has a plain advantage, and the buyer must pay the duty. In fact, the seller is nothing less than the collector of the tax for the power that imposed it. If these duties then are extended to necessaries and conveniences of life in general, and enor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mously increased, the people must at length become indeed
"most exquisitely sensible of their slavish situation."</p>
               <p>Their happiness, therefore, intirely de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends on the moderation of those who have authority to impose the duties.</p>
               <p>I shall now apply these observation to the late act of parliament. Certain duties are thereby imposed on paper and glass, &amp;c. im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ported into these colonies. By the laws of <hi>Great-Britain</hi> we are prohibited to get these articles from any other part of the world. We cannot at present, nor for many years to come, though we should apply ourselves to these manufactures with the utmost industry, make enough ourselves for our own use. That paper and glass are not only convenient, but absolutely necessary for us, I imagine ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry few will contend. Some, perhaps, who think mankind grew wicked and luxurious as soon as they found out another way of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municating
<pb n="75" facs="unknown:010876_0071_0F8524722CF66428"/>
their sentiments than by speech, and another way of dwelling than in caves, may advance so whimsical an opinion. But I presume nobody will take the unnecessary trouble of refuting them.</p>
               <p>From these remarks I think it evident, that we must use paper and glass, that what we use must be <hi>British,</hi> and that we must pay the duties imposed, unless those who sell these articles are so generous as to make us presents of the duties they pay, which is not to be expected.</p>
               <p>Some persons may think this act of no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sequence, because the duties are so <hi>small.</hi> A fatal error. That is the very circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance most alarming to me. For I am con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinced that the authors of this law, would ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver have obtained an act to raise so tri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>ling a sum, as it must do, had they not intend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by it to establish a <hi>precedent</hi> for future use. To console ourselves with the <hi>smallness</hi> of the duties, is to walk deliberately into the s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>are that is set for us, praising the <hi>neatness</hi> of the workmanship. Suppose the duties, imposed by the late act, could be paid by these dissressed colonies, with the utmost ease, and that the purposes, to which they are to be applied, were the most reasonable and e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quitable that could be conceived, the contra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry of which I hope to demonstrate before these letters are concluded, yet even in such a supposed case, these colonies ought to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gard the act with abhorrence. For who are a free people? not those over whom govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is reasonably and equitably exercised
<pb n="76" facs="unknown:010876_0072_0F852472DE88E500"/>
but those who live under a government, so <hi>constitutionally checked</hi> and <hi>controuled,</hi> that proper provision is made against its being o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therwise exercised. The late act is founded on the destruction of this constitutional security.</p>
               <p>If the parliament have a right to lay a duty of four shillings and eight pence on a hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred weight of gl<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>exceeds se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venteen or eighteen times the value of the commodity.</q>
In short, if they have a right to levy a tax of <hi>one penny</hi> upon us, they have a right to levy a <hi>million</hi> upon us. For where does their right stop? At any gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven number of pence, shillings, or pounds? To attempt to limit their right, after grant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to exist at all, is as contrary to reason, as granting it to exist at all is contrary to justice. If they have any right to tax us, then, whether our own money shall continue in our own pockets, or not, depends no long<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er on <hi>us,</hi> but on <hi>them.</hi>

God hath joined them; no British parliament can seperate them; to endeavour to do it is to stab our vitals.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <q>My position is this—I repeat it—I will maintain it to my last hour—Taxation and representation are in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>seperable. This position is founded on the laws of nature; it is more, it is itself an eternal law of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; for whatever is a man's own, is absolutely his own; and no man hath a right to take it from him without his consent, either expressed by himself or representative; whoever attempts to do it, attempts an injury<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> whoever does it, commits a robbery; he throws down the distinction between liberty and sla<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very.</q>
                        <q>There is not a blade of grass, in the most obscure corner of the kingdom, which is not, which was not, represented since the constitution began: there is not a blade of grass, which when taxed, was not taxed by the consent of the proprietor.</q>
                        <q>The forefathers of the Americans did not leave their na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive country, and subject themselves to every danger and distress, to be reduced to the state of slavery. They did not give up their rights; they looked for protec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and not for chains, from their mother-country. By her they expected to be defended in the possession of their property; and not to be deprived of it: For should the present power continue, there is nothing which they can call their own, or, to use the words of Mr. Locke, what property have they in that, which ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther may, by right, take, when he pleases, to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>It is impossible to read this speech and Mr. Pitt's, and not be charmed with the generous zeal for the rights of mankind, that glows in every sentence. These great and good men, animated by the subject they speak up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, seem to rise above all the former glorious exertions of their abilities. A foreigner might be tempted to think they are Americans, asserting with all the ardour of patriotism, and all the anxiety of apprehension, the cause of their native land, and not Britons striving to stop their mistaken countrymen from oppressing others. There reasoning is not only just; it is "vehement," as Mr. Hume says of the eloquence of Demonsthenes,
<q>'Tis disdain, anger, boldness, freedom, involved in a continual stream of argument.</q>

               <opener>
                  <salute>Beloved Countrymen,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>IN my opinion, a dangerous example is set in the last act relating to these colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies. The power of parliament to levy money upon us for raising a revenue, is therein avowed and exerted. Regarding the act on this single principle, I must again repeat, and I think it my duty to repeat, that to me it appears to be unconstitutional.</p>
               <p>No man, who considers the conduct of parliament since the repeal of the Stamp-act, and the disposition of many people at home, can doubt, that the chief object of attention there, is, to use Mr. Grenville's expression,
"providing that the dependance and obedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence of the colonies be asserted and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained."</p>
               <p>Under the influence of this notion, instant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly on repealing the Stamp-act, an act passed, declaring the power of parliament to bind these colonies in all cases whatever. This, however, was only planting a barren tree, that cast a shade indeed over the colonies, but yielded no fruit. It being determined to enforce the authority on which the Stamp-act was founded, the parliament having never renounced the right, as Mr. Pitt ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vised them to do; and it being thought
<pb n="80" facs="unknown:010876_0076_0F85247657701388"/>
proper to disguise that authority in such a manner, as not again to alarm the colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies; some little time was required to find a method, by which both these points should be united. At la the ingenuity of Mr. Greenville and his party accomplished the matter, as it was thought, in "An act for granting certain duties in the British colo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nies and plantations in America, for allow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing drawbacks, &amp;c. which is the title of the act laying duties on paper, &amp;c.</p>
               <p>The parliament having several times be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore imposed duties to be paid in America, it was expected no doubt, that the repeti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of such a measure would be passed over as an usual thing. But to have done this, without expressly asserting and maintaining
"the power of parliament to take our mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney without our consent,"
and to apply it as they please, would not have been sufficiently declarative of its supremacy, nor sufficiently depressive of American freedom.</p>
               <p>Therefore it is, that in this memorable act we find it expressly "provided" that money shall be levied upon us without our consent, for purposes, that render it, if possible, more dreadful than the Stamp-act.</p>
               <p>That act, alarming as it was, declared, the money thereby to be raised, should be applied
<q>towards defraying the expences of defending, protecting and securing the British colonies and plantations in Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca:</q>
And it is evident from the whole act, that by the word "British" were in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended
<pb n="81" facs="unknown:010876_0077_0F852476A5ACE1D8"/>
colonies and plantations settled by British people, and not generally, those sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject to the British crown. That act therefore seemed to have something gentle and kind in its intention, and to aim only at our own wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare: But the act now objected to, imposes duties upon the British colonies,
"to defray the expences of defending, protecting and securing his Majesty's dominions in America."</p>
               <p>What a change of words! What an incom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putable addition to the expences intended by the Stamp-act! "His Majesty's dominions" comprehend not only the British colonies; but also the conquered provinces of Canada and Florida, and the British garrisons of Nova-Scotia; for these do not deserve the name of colonies.</p>
               <p>What justice is there in making us pay for "defending, protecting and securing" these places? What benefit can we, or have we ever derived from them? None of them was con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quered for us; nor will "be defended, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tected and secured" for us.</p>
               <p>In fact, however advantageous the subduing or keeping any of these countries may be to Great-Britain, the acquisition is greatly inju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious to these colonies. Our chief property consists in lands. These would have been of a much greater value, if such prodigious ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditions had not been made to the British ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritories on this continent. The natural in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crease of our own people, if confined within
<pb n="82" facs="unknown:010876_0078_0F85247772F666E8"/>
the colonies, would have raised the value still higher and higher, every fifteen or twenty years. Besides, we should have lived more compactly together, and have been therefore more able to resist any enemy,</p>
               <p>But now the inhabitants will be thinly scattered over an immense region, as those who want settlements, will chuse to make new ones, rather than pay great prices for old ones.</p>
               <p>These are the consequences to the colonies of the hearty assistance they gave to Great-Britain in the late war.—A war, underta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken solely for her own benefit. The objects of it were, the securing to herself the rich tracts of land on the back of these colonies, with the Indian trade, and Nova-Scotia with the fishery. These, and much more has that kingdom gained; but the inferior animals that hunted with the Lion, have been amply rewarded for all the sweat and blood their loyalty cost them, by the honour of having sweated and bled in such company.</p>
               <p>I will not go so far as to say, that Cana<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da and Nova-Scotia are curbs on New-Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land; the chain of forts through the back woods, on the middle provinces; and Flori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>da, on the rest: but I will venture to say, that if the products of Canada, Nova-Scotia and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                     <desc>•</desc>
                  </gap>lorida, deserve any consideration, the two first of them are only rivals of our northern colonies, and the other of our southern.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="83" facs="unknown:010876_0079_0F8524782E0C4CB0"/>It has been said, that without the conquest of these countries, the colonies could not have been "protected, defended, and secur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed;" If that is true, it may with as much propriety be said, that Great-Britain could not have been "defended, protected, and secured" without that conquest: for the colonies are parts of her empire, which it is as much concerns her as them to keep out of the hands of any other power.</p>
               <p>But these colonies when they were much weaker, defended themselves, before this conquest was made; and could again do it, against any that might properly be called their enemies. If France and Spain indeed should attack them, as members of the Bri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tish empire perhaps they might be distressed; but it would be in a British quarrel.</p>
               <p>The largest account I have seen of the num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber of people in Canada, does not make them exceed 90,000. Florida can hardly be said to have any inhabitants—It is computed that there are in our colonies, 3,000,000.—Our force therefore must encrease with a dispro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portion to the growth of their strength, that would render us very safe.</p>
               <p>This being the state of the case, I cannot think it just, that these colonies, labouring under so many misfortunes, should be loaded with taxes, to maintain countries not only not useful, but hurtful to them. The sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port of Canada and Florida cost yearly, it is said, half a million sterling. From hence we
<pb n="84" facs="unknown:010876_0080_0F852478F584A348"/>
may make some guess of the load that is to be laid upon us: for we are not only to "de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fend, protect, and secure" them, but also to make
<q>an adequate provision for defray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the charge of the administration of justice and the support of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in such provinces where it shall be found necessary.</q>
               </p>
               <p>Not one of the provinces of Canada, Nova-Scotia, or Florida, has ever defrayed these expences within itself: And if the duties im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the last statute are collected, all of them together, according to the best in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation I can get, will not pay one quar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter as much as Pennsylvania alone. So that the British colonies are to be drained of the rewards of their labour, to cherish the scorching sands of Florida, and the icy rocks of Canada and Nova-Scotia, which never will return to us one farthing that we send to them.</p>
               <p>Great-Britain—I mean the ministry in Great-Britain, has cantoned Canada and Florida out into five or six governments, and may form as many more. She now has fourteen or fifteen regiments on this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent; and may send over as many more. To make "an adequate provision" for all these expences, is, no doubt, to be the inhe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritance of the colonies.</p>
               <p>Can any man believe that the duties upon paper, &amp;c. are the last that will be laid for these purposes? It is in vain to hope, that because it is imprudent to lay duties on the
<pb n="85" facs="unknown:010876_0081_0F852479ABFF5DE0"/>
exportation of manufactures from a mother country to colonies, as it may promote ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nufactures among them, that this considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion will prevent them.</p>
               <p>Ambitious, artful men have made the measure popular, and whatever injustice or destruction will attend it in the opinion of the colonists, at home it will be thought just and salutary. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                     <p>"So credulous, as well as obstinate, are the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple in believing every thing, which flatters their pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vailing passion."</p>

               <p>The people of Great-Britain will be told, and they have been told, that they are sink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing under an immense debt—that great part of this debt has been contracted in defend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the colonies—that these are so ungrate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful and undutiful, that they will not contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bute one mite to its payment—nor even to the support of the army now kept up for their "protection and security"—that they are rolling in wealth, and are of so bold and republican a spirit, that they are aiming at independance—that the only way to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain them in "obedience" is to keep a strict watch over them, and to draw off part of their riches in taxes—and that every bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den laid upon them is taking off so much from Great-Britain—These assertions will be generally believed, and the people will be persuaded that they cannot be too angry with their colonies, as that anger will be profitable to themselves.</p>

                  <pb n="86" facs="unknown:010876_0082_0F85247B05FDDFE0"/>In truth, Great-Britain alone receives any benefit from Canada, Nova-Scotia, and Florida; and therefore she alone ought to maintain them.—The old maxim of the law is drawn from reason and justice, and never could be more properly applied, than in this case.</p>

                  <salute>Beloved Countrymen,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>I HAVE made some observations on the purposes for which money is to be levied upon us by the late act of parliament. I shall now offer to your consideration some further reflections on that subject; and, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>less I am greatly mistaken, if these purpos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es are accomplished, according to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prest intention of the act, they will be found effectually to supersede that authority in our respective assemblies, which is most essential to liberty. The question is not whether some branches shall be lopt off—The ax is laid to the root of the tree; and the whole body must infallibly perish, if we remain idle spectators of the work.</p>
               <p>No free people ever existed, or ever can exist, without, keeping, to use a common but strong expression, "the purse strings" in their own hands. Where this is the case, they have a constitutional check upon the administration, which may thereby be brought into order without violence: but where such a power is not lodged in the people, oppression proceeds uncontrouled in its career, till the governed, transported
<pb n="88" facs="unknown:010876_0084_0F85247BF4CA05D8"/>
into rage, seeks redress in the midst of blood and confusion.</p>
               <p>The elegant and ingenious Mr. Hume, speaking of the Anglo-Norman government, says
<q>princes and ministers were too igno<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rant to be themselves sensible of the ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages attending an equitable admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration; and there was no established council or assembly which could protect the people, and, by withdrawing sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plies, regularly and peaceably admonish the King of his duty, and ensure the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecution of the laws</q>
               </p>
               <p>Thus this great man, whose political re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flections are so much admired, makes this power one of the foundations of liberty.</p>
               <p>The English history abounds with instan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, proving that this is the proper and suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cessful way to obtain redress of grievances. How often have Kings and ministers endea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>voured to throw off this legal curb upon them, by attempting to raise money by a variety of inventions, under pretence of law, without having recourse to parliament? And how often have they been brought to reason, and peaceably obliged to do justice, by the exertion of this constitutional authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of the people, vested in their representa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives?</p>
               <p>The inhabitants of these colonies have on inumberless occasions, reaped the benefits of this authority lodged in their assemblies.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="89" facs="unknown:010876_0085_0F85247CA44EF7B8"/>It has been for a long time, and now is, a constant instruction to all governors, to obtain a permanent support for the offices of government. But as the author of the administration of the colonies says,
<q>this order of the crown is generally, if not universally, rejected by the legislatures of the colonies.</q>
               </p>
               <p>They perfectly know how much their grie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vances would be regarded, if they had no o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther method of engaging attention, than by complaining. Those who rule, are ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremely apt to think well of the constructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons made by themselves, in support of their own power. These are frequently errone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous and pernicious to those they govern— Dry remonstrances, to shew that such con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>structions are wrong and oppressive, carry very little weight with them, in the opinion of persons, who gratify their own inclinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in making these constructions. They cannot understand the reasoning that opposes their power and desire: but let it be made their interest to understand such reasoning— and a wonderful light is instantly thrown on the matter; and then rejected remonstran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces become as clear as "proof of holy "writ." <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Shakespear.</note>
               </p>
               <p>The three most important articles, that our assemblies, or any legislatures can pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vide for, are, first the defence of the socie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:
<pb n="90" facs="unknown:010876_0086_0F85247D664A7D80"/>
secondly—the administration of justice: and, thirdly, the support of civil government.</p>
               <p>Nothing can properly regulate the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of making provision for these occasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, but the necessities of the society; its a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bilities; the conveniency of the modes of levying money among them; the manner in which the laws have been executed; and the conduct of the officers of government; all which are circumstances that cannot pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sibly be properly known, but by the society itself; or, if they should be known, will not, probably, be properly considered, but by that society.</p>
               <p>If money may be raised upon us, by o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers, without our consent, for our "de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fence," those who are the judges in levy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it, must also be the judges in applying it. Of consequence, the money said to be taken from us for our defence, may be em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ployed to our injury. We may be chained in by a line of fortifications: obliged to pay for building and maintaining them; and be told that they are for our defence. With what face can we dispute the fact, after having granted, that those who apply the money, had a right to levy it; for, surely, it is much easier for their wisdom to understand how to apply it in the best manner, than how to levy it in the best manner. Besides, the right of levying is of infinitely more consequence, than that of applying. The people of England, that would burst out in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to
<pb n="91" facs="unknown:010876_0087_0F85247F1B159BE8"/>
fury, if the crown should attempt to le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vy money by its own authority, have assign<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the crown the application of money.</p>
               <p>As to "the administration of justice"—the judges ought, in a well regulated state, to be equally independant of the legislative powers. Thus, in England, judges hold their commissions from the crown "during good behaviour;" and have salaries, suit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to their dignity, settled on them by parliament. The purity of the courts of law, since this establishment, is a proof of the wisdom with which it was made.</p>
               <p>But, in these colonies, how fruitless has been every attempt to have the judges ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed during good behaviour; yet whoe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver considers the matter will soon perceive, that such commissions are beyond all com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>parison more necessary in these colonies, than they are in England.</p>
               <p>The chief danger to the subject there, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rose from the arbitrary designs of the crown; but here, the time may come, when we may have to contend with the designs of the crown, and of a mighty kingdom. What then will be our chance, when the laws of life and death, are to be spoken by judges, totally dependant on that crown and king<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom—sent over, perhaps, from thence— filled with British prejudice—and backed by a standing army, supported out of our own pockets, to "assert and maintain" our own "dependance and obedience?</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="92" facs="unknown:010876_0088_0F85248014931ED0"/>But supposing, that through the extreme lenity that will prevail in the government, through all future ages, these colonies never will bohold any thing like the campaign of chief justice Jeffereys, yet what innumerable acts of injustice may be committed, and how fatally may the principles of liberty be s<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>There are two other considerations, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating to this head, that deserve the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

strangers to these colonies—what an engine of oppression may this authority be in such hands?</p>
               <p>I am well aware that writs of this kind may be granted at home, under the seal of the court of exchequer: But I know also that the greatest asserters of the rights of Englishmen, have always strenuously contend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, that such a power was dangerous to free<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, and expressly contrary to the common law, which ever regarded a man's house, as his castle, or a place of perfect security.</p>
               <p>If such a power is in the least degree dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous there, it must be utterly destructive to liberty here.—For the people there have two securities against the undue exercise of this power by the crown, which are want<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with us, if the late act takes place. In the first place, if any injustice is done there, the person injured may bring his action against the offender, and have it tried by independant judges, who are <note n="(b)" place="bottom">The writs for searching houses in England are to be granted under the seal of the court of ex<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

               <p>To say that the cause is to be tried by a jury can never reconcile men, who have any idea of freedom to such a power.—For we know, that sheriffs in almost every colony
<pb n="94" facs="unknown:010876_0090_0F8524811E1BD320"/>
on this continent, are totally dependant on the crown; and packing of juries has been frequently practised even in the capital of of the British empire. Even if juries are well inclined, we have too many instances of the influence of overbearing unjust judges upon them. The brave and wise men who accomplished the revolution, thought the independency of judges essential to freedom.</p>
               <p>The other security which the people have at home, but which we shall want here, is this.—If this power is abused there, the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, the grand resource of the opprest people, is ready to afford relief. Redress of grievances must precede grants of money. But what regard can we expect to have paid to our assemblies, when they will not hold even the puny privilege of French par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liaments—that of regestering the edicts, that take away our money, before they are put in execution.</p>
               <p>The second consideration above hinted at, is this—There is a confusion in our laws that is quite unknown in Great-Britain. As this cannot be described in a more clear or ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>act manne<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <g ref="char:punc">▪</g> than has been done by the inge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nious author of the history of New-York, I beg leave to use his words.
"The state of our laws opens a door to much controversy. The uncertainty which respect them, ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders property precarious, and greatly expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses us to the arbitary decision of unjust judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es.
<pb n="95" facs="unknown:010876_0091_0F85248380D3F5B8"/>
The common law of England is gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally received, together with such statutes, as were enacted before we had a legislature of our own; but our courts exercise a sove<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reign authority, in determining what parts of the common and statute law ought to be extended: For it must be admitted, that the difference of circumstances necessarily requires us, in some cases, to reject the determinati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of both. In many instances they have al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>so extended even acts of parliament, passed since we had a distinct legislature, which is greatly adding to our confusion. The prac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice of our courts is no less uncertain than the law. Some of the English rules are a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dopted, others rejected. Two things there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore seem to be absolutely necessary for the public security. First the passing an act for settling the extent of the English laws. Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>condly, that the courts ordain a general set of rules for the regulation of the practice."</p>
               <p>How easy will it be under this "state of our laws" for an artful judge to act in the most arbitary manner, and yet cover his conduct under specious pretences, and how difficult will it be for the injured people to obtain redress, may be readily perceived. We may take a voyage of three thousand miles to complain; and after the trouble and ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard we have undergone, we may be told, that the collection of the revenue and main<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tenance of the prerogative, must not be dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couraged.—And if the misbehaviour is so
<pb n="96" facs="unknown:010876_0092_0F8524845161A178"/>
gross as to admit of no justification, it may be said that it was an error in judgment on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, arising from the confusion of our laws, and the zeal of the King's servants to do their duty.</p>
               <p>If the commissions of judges are during the pleasure of the crown, yet if their sala<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries are during the pleasure of the people, there will be some check upon their conduct. Few men will consent to draw on themselves the hatred and contempt of those among whom they live, for the empty honour of being judges. It is the sordid love of gain that tempts men to turn their backs on virtue, and pay their homage where they ought not.</p>
               <p>As to the third particular, the "support "of civil government," few words will be sufficient. Every man of the least under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>standing must know, that the executive power may be exercised in a manner so disagreeable and harassing to the people, that it is absol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>utely requisite, they should be enabled by the gentlest method which human policy has yet been ingenious enough to invent, that is by the shutting their hands, to "admonish" (as Mr. Hume says) certain persons "of "their duty,"</p>

               <p>Let the reader pause here one moment, and reflect—whether the colony in which he lives, has not made such "certain and ade<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quate "provisions" for these purposes, as is by the colony judged suitable to its abili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, and all other circumstances. Then let him reflect—whether, if this act takes place, money is not to be raised on that colony without its consent to make provision for these purposes, which it does not judge to be suitable to its abilities, and all other cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumstances. Lastly, let him reflect—whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the people of that country are not in a state of the most abject, slavery, whose property may be taken from them under the notion of right, when they have refused to give it. For my part, I think I have good reason for vindicating the honour of the as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>semblies on this continent, by publicly assert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, that they have made as "certain and "adequate provsion" for the purposes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bove-mentioned, as they <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

should these most important truths be wrested out of their hands? Why should they not now be permitted to enjoy that authority, which they have exercised from the first settlement of these colonies? Why should they be scandalized by this innovati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, when their respective provinces are now, and will be for several years, labouring un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der load<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> of debts imposed on them for the very purposes now spoken of? Why should the inhabitants of all these colonies be with the utmost indignity treated, as a herd of despicable wretches, so utterly void of com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon sense, that they will not even make "adequate provision" for the "admini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stration "of justice" and "the support of "civil government" among them, for their "own defence"—though without such "provision" every people must inevitably be overwhelmed with anarchy and destructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on? Is it possible to form an idea of slavery more complete, more miserable, more dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>graceful, than that of a people, where jus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tice is administred, government exercised, and a standing army maintained, at the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence of the people, and yet without the least dependance upon them? If we can find no relief from this infamous situation, let Mr. Grenville set his fertile fancy again to work, and as by one exertion of it, he has stripped us of our property and liberty, let him by another deprive us of our understand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing too, that unconscious of what we have

been or are, and ungoaded by tormenting reflections, we may tamely bow down our necks with all the stupid serenity of servitude, to any drudgery, which our lords and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters may please to command.—</p>
               <p>When the "charges of the administration of justice,"—"the support of civil govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;"—and "the expences of defending protecting and securing" us, are provid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed for, I should be glad to know upon what occasion the crown will ever call our assem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blies together. Some few of them may meet of their own accord, by virtue of their charters: But what will they have to do when they are met? To what shadows will they be reduced? The men, whose delibera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions heretofore had an influence on every matter relating to the liberty and happiness of themselves and their constituents, and whose authority in domestic affairs, at least, might well be compared to that of Roman senators, will now find their deliberations of no more consequence than those of consta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bles.—They may perhaps be allowed to make laws for yoking of hogs, or pounding of stray cattle. Their influence will hardly be permitted to extend so high as the keep<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing roads in repair, as that business may more properly be executed by those who receive the public cash.</p>
               <p>One most memorable example in history is so applicable to the point now insisted on,

And if the taxes should prove at any time insufficient to answer all the expences of the numberless offices, which ministers may please to create, surely the house of Commons would be too "modest" to contradict a minister who should tell them, it was become necessary to lay a new tax upon the colonies, for the laudable purpose of

               <p>It is pretty well known on this continent, that Ireland has, with a regular consistence of injustice, been cruelly treated by ministers, in the article of pensions; but there are some alarming circumstances relating to that subject, which I wish to have better known among us.</p>

<q>for pay of the army, and defraying other public charges in defence and preservation of the kingdom</q>

from the hearth-money granted, as a
<q>public re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venue for public charges and expences.</q>
There are some other branches of the reve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue, concerning which there is not any ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>press appropriation of them for public ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice, but which were plainly so intended.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="104" facs="unknown:010876_0100_0F851F1076F296E0"/>Of these branches of the revenue, the crown is only a trustee for the public. They are unalienable; <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>hey are inapplicable to any other purposes, but those for which they were established; and therefore are not legally chargeable with pensions.</p>
               <p>There is another kind of revenue, which is a private revenue. This is not limited to any public uses; but the crown has the same property in it, that any person has in his estate. This does not amount at the most to fifteen thousand pounds a year, probably not to seven; and it is the only revenue that can legally be charged with pensions. If mini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sters were accustomed to regard the rights or happiness of the people, the pensions in Ireland would not exceed the sum just menti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>oned: but long since have they exceeded that limit, and in December, 1765, a moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on was made in the House of Commons in that kingdom, to address his Majesty, on the great increase of pensions on the Irish establishment, amounting to the sum of £. 158, 685 in the last two years.</p>
               <p>Attempts have been made to gloss over these gross incroachments, by this specious argument,—
<q>That expending a competent part of the public revenue in pensions, from a principle of charity or generosity, adds to the dignity of the crown, and is, therefore, useful to the public.</q>
To give this argument any weight, it must appear that the pensions proceed from "charity
<pb n="105" facs="unknown:010876_0101_0F851F112D7C2658"/>
"or generosity" only—And that it "adds "to the dignity of the crown" to act di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rectly contrary to law.</p>
               <p>From this conduct towards Ireland, in open violation of law, we may easily <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>applied, by virtue of warrants under the sign manual, coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tersigned by the high treasurer, or any three of the commissioners of the trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sury.</q>

               <p>Besides the burden of pensions in Ireland, which have enormously encreased within these few years, almost all the offices, in that poor kingdom, have, since the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mencement of the present century, and now are bestowed upon strangers.

Among other arguments in favour of Ireland, it was in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sisted "That by cutting off almost entirely the trade between the kingdoms, all the natural bands of union were dissolved, and nothing remained to keep the Irish in their duty, but force and violence,</p>
                     <p>
                        <q>The King (says Mr. Hume in his History of England) was so covinced of the justice of these reasons, that he used all his interest to oppose the bill, and he o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penly declared, that he could not give his assent to it with a safe conscience. But the Commons were reso<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute in their purpose. And the spirit of tyrany, of which nations are as susceptible as individuals, had animated the English extremely to exert their superi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ority over their dependant state. No affair could be conducted with greater violence than this, by the Commons. They even went so far in the preamble of the bill, as to declare the importation of Irish cat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle to be a nusance. By this expression they gave scope to their passion, and at the same time, barred the King's prerogative, by which he might think him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>self intitled to dispense with a law so full of injustice and bad policy. The lords expunged the word, but as the King was sensible that no supply would be giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en by the Commons, unless they were gratified in all their prejudices, he was obliged both to employ his interest with the Peers to make the bill pass, and to give the Royal assent to it. He could not however for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bear expressing his displeasure, at the jealousy enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained against him, and at the intention which the Commons discovered of retrenching his prerogative.</q>
                     </p>
                     <p>This law brought great distress for sometime upon Ire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land, but it occasioned their applying with great indus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>try to manufactures, and has proved, in the issue, bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ficial to that kingdom.</p>
                     <p>Perhaps the same reason occasioned the "barring the "King's prerogative" in the late act suspending the le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gislation of New-York.</p>
                     <p>This we may be assured of, that we are as dear to his Majesty, as the people of Great-Britain are. We are his subjects as well as they, and as faithful subjects; and his Majesty has given too many, too constant proofs of his piety and virtue, for any man, to think it possible, that such a Prince can make any unjust distinction between such subjects. It makes no difference to his Majesty, whether supplies are raised in Great-Britain, or Ameri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ca: but it makes some difference, to the Commons of that kingdom.</p>
                     <p>To speak plainly, as becomes an honest man on such important occasions, all our misfortunes are owing to a lust of power in men of abilities and influence. This prompts them to seek popularity, by expedients profita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to themselves, though ever so destructive to their country.</p>
                     <p>Such is the accursed nature of lawless ambition, and yet—what heart but melts at the thought?—Such false detestable patriots in every nation have led their blind confiding country, shouting their applauses, into the jaws of shame and ruin.

               <p>True it is, that if the people of Great-Britain were not too much blinded by the passions, that have been artfully excited in their breasts, against their dutiful children, the colonists, these considerations would be nearly as alarming to them as to us.

matter to prove that the people have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creased.</p>
               <p>Surely, therefore, those who wish the wel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fare of their country, ought seriously to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect what may be the consequence of such a new creation of offices, in the disposal of the crown. The army, the administration of justice, and the civil government here, with such salaries as the crown shall please to an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nex, will extend ministerial influence, as much beyond its former bounds, as the late war did the British dominions.</p>
               <p>But whatever the people of Great-Britain may think on this occasion, I hope the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple of these colonies will unanimously join in this sentiment, that the late act of parlia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is injurious to their liberty; and that this sentiment will unite them in a firm op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>position
<pb n="111" facs="unknown:010876_0107_0F851F15A53D4F58"/>
to it, in the same manner as the dread of the Stamp-act did.</p>
               <p>Some persons may imagine the sums to be raised by it, are but small, and therefore may be inclined to acquiesce under it. A conduct more dangerous to freedom, as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore has been observed, can never be adopt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. Nothing is wanted at home but a pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedent, the force of which shall be establish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, by the tacit submission of the colonies. With what zeal was the statute erecting the post-office, and another relating to the reco<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very of debts in America, urged and tortur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, as precedents in the support of the Stamp-act, though wholly inapplicable. If the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament succeeds in this attempt, other sta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tutes will impose other duties. Instead of taxing ourselves as we have been accustomed to do from the first settlement of these pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vinces; all our useful taxes will be convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into parliamentary taxes on our importa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions; and thus the parliament will levy up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on us such sums of money as they chuse to take, without any other limitation than their pleasure.</p>
               <p>We know how much labour and care have been bestowed by these colonies, in lay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing taxes in such a manner, that they should be most easy to the people, by being laid on the proper articles; most equal, by being proportioned to every man's circumstances; and cheapest by the method directed for collecting them.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="112" facs="unknown:010876_0108_0F851F165FA02548"/>But parliamentary taxes will be laid on u<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap> without any consideration, whether there is any easier mode. The only point regarded will be, the certainty of levying the taxes, and not the convenience of the people, on whom they are to be levied, and therefore all statutes on this head will be such as will be most likely, according to the favourite phrase, "to execute themselves."</p>
               <p>Taxes in every free state have been, and ought to be as exactly proportioned, as is possible, to the abilities of those who are to pay them. They cannot otherwise be just. Even a Hottentot could comprehend the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reasonableness, of making a poor man pay as much for defending the property of a rich man, as the rich man pays himself.</p>
               <p>Let any person look into the late act of parliament, and he will immediately perceive, that the immense estates of Lord Fairfax, Lord Baltimore, and our proprietors, which are amongst "his Majesty's other domini<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons" to be "defended, protected and se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured" by that act will not pay a single farthing of the duties thereby imposed, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept Lord Fairfax wants some of his win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows glazed.

               <p>I mention these particular cases as strik<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing instances, how far the late act is a devi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation from that principle of justice, which has so constantly distingui<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>The third consideration with our conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nental assemblies in laying taxes has been the method of collecting them. This has been done by a few officers under the inspec<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of the respective assemblies, with mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rate allowances. No more was raised from the subject, than was used for the intended purposes. But by the late act, a minister may appoint as many officers as he pleases for collecting the taxes; may assign them what salaries he thinks "adequate" and they are to be subject to no inspection but his own.</p>
               <p>In short, if the late act of parliament takes effect, these colonies must dwindle down into "common corporations," as their e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies in the debates concerning the repeal of the Stamp-act, strenuously insisted they were: and it is not improbable, that some future historians will thus record our fall.</p>

How<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever the cause of dissention was removed by a repeal of the statute, that had given of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fense.

The authors of that statute triumphed greatly on this conduct of the colonies, and insisted that if the people of Great-Britain, had persisted in enforcing it, the Americans would have been in a few months so fatigued with the efforts of patriotism, that they would quickly have yielded obedience.</p>

               </opener>
               <p>I HAVE several times, in the course of these letters, mentioned the late act of parliament, as being the foundation of fu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture measures injurious to these colonies; and the belief of this truth I wish to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail, because I think it necessary to our safety.</p>
               <p>A perpetual jealousy respecting liberty, is absolutely requisite in all free states. The very texture of their constitution, in mixt governments, demands it. For the cautions with which power is distributed a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the several orders, imply, that each has that share which is proper for the gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral welfare, and therefore, that any further imposition must be pernicious. <note n="(a)" place="bottom">Machiavel's discourses. Book 3, chap. 1.</note> Machiavel employs a whole chapter in his discourses, to prove that a state, to be long lived, must be frequently corrected, and reduced to its first principles. But of all states that have existed, there never was any, in which this jealousy could be more proper than in these colonies. For the government here is not only mixt, but dependant, which circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stance
<pb n="118" facs="unknown:010876_0113_0F851F1A218F4730"/>
occasions a peculiarity in its form, of a very delicate nature.</p>
               <p>Two reasons induce me to desire, that this spirit of apprehension may be always keept up among us, in its utmost vigilance. The first is this, that as the happiness of these provinces indubitably consists in their con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nection with Great-Britain, any separation between them is less likely to be occasioned by civil discords, if every disgusting mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure is opposed singly, and while it is new: for in this manner of proceeding, every such measure is most likely to be rectified. On the other hand, oppressions and dissatisfac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions being permitted to accumulate—if ever the governed throw off the load, they will do more. A people does not reform with moderation. The rights of the sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject therefore cannot be too often consider<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, explained, or asserted: and whoever attempts to do this, shews himself, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever may be the rash and peevish reflections of pretended wisdom, and pretended duty, a friend to those who injudiciously exercise their power, as well as to them, over whom it is so exercised.</p>
               <p>Had all the points of prerogative claimed by Charles I. been separately contested and settled in preceeding reigns, his fate would in all probability have been very different, and the people would have been content with that liberty which is compatible with regal
<pb n="119" facs="unknown:010876_0114_0F851F1AE4467408"/>
authority. But <note n="(b)" place="bottom">The author is sensible that this is putting the gentlest construction on Charles' conduct; and that is one reason why he chuses it. Allowance ought to be made for the errors of those men, who are acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged to have been possessed of many virtues. The e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducation of that unhappy Prince, and his confidence in men not so good and wise as himself, had probably fill<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him with mistaken notions of his own authority, and of the consequences that would attend concessions of a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny kind to a people, who were represented to him as aiming at too much power.</note> he thought, it would be as dangerous for him to give up the powers which at any time had been by usurpation ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ercised by the crown, as those that were legally vested in it. This produced an equal excess on the part of the people. For when their passions were excited by multiplied grievances, they thought it would be as dangerous for them, to allow the powers that were legally vested in the crown, as those which at any time had been by usur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation exercised by it. Acts, that might by themselves have been upon many con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>siderations excused or extenuated, derived a contagious malignancy and odium from other acts, with which they were connected. They were not regarded according to the simple force of each, but as parts of a system of oppression. Every one therefore, however small in itself, being alarming, as an additional evidence of tyrannical designs. It was in vain for prudent and moderate men to insist, that there was no necessity to abolish royalty. Nothing less than the utter

destruction of monarchy, could satisfy those who had suffered, and thought they had rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>son to believe, they always should suffer un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der it.</p>
               <p>The consequences of these mutual dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trusts are well known: But there is no other people mentioned in history, that I recollect, who have been so constantly watchful of their liberty, and so successful in their strug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gles for it, as the English. This considera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion leads me to the second reason, why I
"desire that the spirit of apprehension may be always kept up among us in its utmost vigilance."</p>
               <p>The first principles of government are to be looked for in human nature. Some of the best writers have asserted, and it seems with good reason, that "government is founded on <note n="(c)" place="bottom">
                     <p>"Opinion is of two kinds, viz. opinion of inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rest, and opinion of right. By opinion of interest, I chiefly understand, the sense of public advantage which is reaped from government; together with the persuasi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, that the particular government which is established, is equally advantageous with any other, that could be easily settled."</p>
                     <p>"Right is of two kinds, right to power, and right to property. What prevalence opinion of the first kind has over mankind may easily be understood, by observing the attachment which all nations have to their ancient government, and even to those names which have had the sanction of antiquity. Antiquity always begets the opinion of right."
"It is sufficiently understood, that the opinion of right to property, is of the greatest mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment in all matters of government."</p>

               <p>Custom undoubtedly has a mighty force in producing opinion, and reigns in nothing

more arbitrarily than in public affairs. It gradually reconciles us to objects even of dread and detestation; and I cannot but think these lines of Mr. Pope, as applicable to vice in politics, as to vice in ethics.</p>
               <l>'Vice is a monster of so horrid mien,</l>
               <l>'As to be hated, needs but to be seen;</l>
               <l>'Yet seen too oft, familiar with her face,</l>
               <l>'We first endure, then pity, then embrace.'</l>
               <p>When an act injurious to freedom has been once done, and the people bear it, the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petition of it is most likely to meet with submission. For as the mischief of the one was found to be tolerable, they will hope that of the second will prove so too; and they will not regard the infamy of the last, because they are stained with that of the first.</p>

They voluntarily fasten their chains, by adopting a pusillanimous opinion,
"that there will be too much dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger in attempting a remedy," or another opinion no l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

They then seek a wretched relief for their minds, by persuading themselves, that to yield their obedience is to discharge their duty. The deplorable poverty of spirit, that prostrates all the dignity bestowed by divine providence on our nature—of course succeeds.</p>
               <p>From these reflections I conclude, that every free state should incessantly watch, and instantly take alarm on any addition being made to the power exercised over them, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>numerable instances might be produced to shew, from what slight beginnings the most extensive consequences have flowed: but I shall select two only from the history of England.</p>
               <p>Henry the seventh was the first monarch of that kingdom, who established a standing body of armed men. This was a band of 50 archers, called yeomen of the guard: And this institution, notwithstanding the smallness of the number, was, to prevent discontent, <note n="(f)" place="bottom">Rapin's History of England.</note>
"disguised under the pretence of majesty and grandeur."
In 1684, the standing forces were so much augmented, that Rapin says—
"The King, in order to make his people fully sensible of their new slavery, affected to muster his troops, which amounted to 4000 well armed and disciplined men."
I think our army, at this time, consists of more than seventy regiments.</p>
               <p>
                  <pb n="124" facs="unknown:010876_0119_0F851F22B9CE85E0"/>The method of taxing by excise was first introduced amidst the convulsions of civil wars. Extreme necessity was pretended, and its short continuance promised. After the restoration, an excise upon beer, ale and other liquors, was granted to the <note n="(g)" place="bottom">12 Car. II.

Chap. 1. and 4.</note> gave him the first excise, with an ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditional duty on wine, tobacco, and some other things. Since the revolution it has been extended to salt, candles, leather, hides, hops, soap, paper, paste-board, mill-boards<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> scaleboards, vellum, parchm<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

               <p>Thus a standing army and excise have, from the first slender origins, tho' always hated, always feared, always opposed, at length swelled up to their vast present bulk.</p>
               <p>These facts are sufficient to support what I have said. 'Tis true that all the mischiefs apprehended by our ancestors from a stand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing army and excise, have not yet happen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed: but it does not follow from thence, that they will not happen.

When Charles II. had strengthened himself by the return of the garrison of Tangier,

               <p>Every duty thereby laid on articles of British manufacture, is laid on some com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>modity upon the exportation of which from Great-Britain, a drawback i<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The Parliament therefore might in half a dozen lines have raised much more money only by stopping the drawbacks in the hands of the officers at home, on exportation to these colonies, than by this solemn imposi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of taxes upon us, to be collected here. Probably, the artful contrivers of this act formed it in this manner, in order to reserve to themselves, in c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<q>That the drawbacks are gifts to the co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lonies; and that the act only lessens those gifts.</q>

If, therefore, the sum to be obtained by the late act had been the sole object in forming it, there would not have been any occasion for the

"The regulation of the colonies."
the whole remittance from all the taxes in the colonies, at an average of thir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty years, has not amounted to one thousand nine hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred pounds a year, and in that time, seven or eight hundred pounds per annum only, have been remitted from North-America.</p>
                     <p>The smallness of the revenue arising from the duties in America, demonstrated that they were intended only as regulations of trade; and can any person be so blind to truth, so dull of apprehension in a matter of un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>speakable importance to his country, as to imagine, that the board of commissioners lately established at such a charge, is instituted to assist in collecting one thousand nine hundred pounds a year, or the trifling duties im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>posed by the late act?

                  <salute>Beloved Countrymen,</salute>
               </opener>
               <p>SOME states have lost their liberty by particular accidents; but this calamity is generally owing to the decay of virtue. A people is travelling fast to destruction, when individuals consider their interests as distinct from those of the public. Such no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions are fatal to their country, and to them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves. Yet how many are there so weak, and sordid as to think they perform all the offices of life, if they earnestly endeavour to increase their own wealth, power, and credit, without the least regard for the soci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ety, under the protection of which they live; who, if they can make an immediate pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fit to themselves, by lending their assistance to those, whose projects plainly tend to the injury of their country, rejoice in their dex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, and believe themselves intitled to the character of able politicians. Miserable men! of whom it is hard to say, whether they ought to be most the objects of pity or contempt, but whose opinions are certainly as detestable as their practices are destructive.</p>
               <p>Though I always reflect with a high plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sure on the integrity and understanding of
<pb n="134" facs="unknown:010876_0128_0F851F29E4BEAD60"/>
my countrymen, which, joined with a pure and humble devotion to the great and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious author of every blessing they enjoy, will, I hope, ensure to them, and their pos<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terity, all temporal and eternal happiness; yet when I consider, that in every age and country there have been bad men, my heart, at this threatening period, is so full of <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  </gap>, but that there may be some on this conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent, against whom you ought to be upon your guard. Men, who either <note n="(a)" place="bottom">
                     <p>It is not intended by these words to throw any re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection upon gentlemen, because they are possessed of offices; for many of them are certainly men of vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tue, and lovers of their country. But supposed obliga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of gratitude and honour may induce them to be silent. Whether these obligations ought to be regarded or not, is not so much to be considered by others, in the judgment they form of these gentlemen, as whether they think they ought to be regarded. Perhaps, there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore we shall act in the properest manner towards them, if we neither reproach nor imitate there. The persons meant in this letter, are the base spirited wretches, who may endeavor to distinguish themselves, by their sordid zeal, in defending and promoting measures, which they know, beyond all question, to be destructive to the just rights and true interests of their country. It is scarce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly possible, to speak of these men with any degree of patience. It is scarcely possible to speak of them with any degree of propriety. For no words can truly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>scribe their guilt, and meanness. But every honest man, on their being mentioned, will feel what cannot be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pressed. If their wickedness did not blind them, they might perceive, along the coast of these colonies, many skeletons of wretched ambition; who after distinguish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing themselves, in support of the Stamp-act, by a cou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ragious contempt of their country, and of justice, have been left to linger out their miserable existence, without a government, collectorship, secretaryship, or any other commission to console them, as well as it could for loss of virtue and reputation—while numberless of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices have been bestowed in these colonies, on people from Great-Britain, and new ones are continually in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vented to be thus bestowed. As a few great prizes are put into a lottery to tempt multitudes to lose, so here and there an American has been raised to a good post—
"Apparent rari nantes in gurgite vasto."</p>
                     <p>Mr. Grenville, indeed, in order to recommend the Stamp-act, had the unequalled generosity, to power down a golden shower of offices upon Americans; and yet these ungrateful colonies did not thank Mr. Gren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ville for shewing his kindness to their countrymen, nor them for excepting it. How must that great statesman have been surprised to find, that the unpolished colonists could not be reconciled to infamy, by treachery? Such a bountiful disposition towards us never appeared in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny minister before him, and probably never will appear again. For it is evident that such a system of policy is to be established on this continent, as, in a short time, is to render it utterly unnecessary to use the least art in order to conciliate our approbation of any measures. Some of our countrymen may be employed to six chains upon us; but they will never be permitted to hold them afterwards. So that the utmost that any of them can expect, is only a temporary provision, that may expire in their own time; but which, they may be assured, will prec<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

The natives of America, will sink into total neglect and contempt, the moment that their country loses the constitutional powers she now posses<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ses.

                     <p>If any person shall imagine that he discovers in these letters the least disaffection towards our most excellent Sovereign, and the parliament of Great-Britain; or the least dislike to the dependance of these colonies on that kingdom, I beg that such person will not form any judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment on particular expressions, but will consider the te<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour of all the letters taken together. In that case, I <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>latter myself that every unprejudiced reader will be convinced, that the true interests of Great-Britain are as dear to me as they ought to be to every good subject.</p>
                     <p>If I am an Enthusiast in any thing, it is in my zeal for the pe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>petual dependance of these colonies on their mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther-country.—A dependance founded on mutual bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fits, the continuance of which can be secured only by mutual affections. Therefore it is, that with extreme apprehension I view the smallest seeds of discontent, which are unwarily scattered abroad. Fifty or sixty years will make astonishing alterations in these colonies; and this consideration should render it the business of Great Britain more and more to cultivate our good dis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>positions towards her: but the misfortune is, that those great men, who are wrestling for power at home, think themselves very slightly interested in the prosperity of their country fifty or sixty years hence; but are deeply concerned in blowing up a popular clamour for supposed immediate advantages.</p>
                     <p>For my part, I regard Great-Bitain as a bulwark happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly fixed between these colonies and the powerful nations of Europe. That kingdom is our advanced post or fortifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, which remaining safe, we under its protection enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing peace, may diffuse the blessings of religion, science, and liberty, throw remote wildernesses. It is, therefore, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contestibly our duty and our interest, to support the strength of Great-Britain. When, confiding in that strength, she begins to forget from whence it arose, it will be an easy thing to shew the source. She may readily be reminded of the loud alarm spread among her merchants and trades<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men, by the universal association of these colonies, at the time of the Stamp-Act, not to import any of her manufac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures.—In the year 1718, the Russians and Swedes en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered into an agreement, not to suffer Great-Britain to ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port any naval stores from their dominions, but in Russian or Swedish ships, and at their own prices. Great-Britain was distrest. Pitch and tar rose to three pounds a barrel. At length she thought of getting these articles from the colonies; and the attempt suc<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="3 letters">

               <p>We have reason to believe, that several of his Majesty's present ministers are good men, and friends to our country; and it seems not unlikely, that by a particular con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence of events, we have been treated a little more severely than they wished we

should be. They might not think it pru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dent to stem a torrent. But what is the difference to us, whether arbitrary acts take their rise from ministers, or are per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>permitted by them? Ought any point to be allowed to a good minister, that should be denied to a bad one? The mortality of ministers is a very frail mortality. A *** may succeed a Shelburne—a *** may suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed a Conway.</p>

The term seems to have particular propriety when referred to these colonies, with a different meaning annexed to it, from that in which it is ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken there. By the word "minister" we may understand not only a servant of the crown, but a man of influence among the Commons, who regard themselves as having a share of the sovereignty over us.

            <p>To such eminent worth and virtue, the inhabitants of the town of BOSTON, the capital of the province of the MASSACHU<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>SETS-BAY, in full town meeting assembled, express their earliest gratitude.
