            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>IT ſometimes happens that men, who make the moſt dangerous deviations from the laws of ſociety, and the principles of virtue, in a great meaſure owe their crimes to the very benevolence of their hearts; and that in the midſt of all their guilt we find a dignity of ſoul which commands our higheſt admiration.</p>

                  <p>THE parents of the unhappy youth, whoſe ſtory we are abut to relate, dwelt at S—, a little town in the County of N—, where his father, a man of great merit and ſtrict piety, officiated as curate, with an income of about fifty pounds a year. Florio was their only child, who being a lad of a ſprightly genius, had ſo far improv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed by the unwearied aſſiduity of his father,
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:033533_0010_0FF778E7D66F7820"/>
as to be, in his twelfth year, a perfect maſter of the Latin tongue, and not entire<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly unacquainted with the Greek: Yet, great as his father's care was in inſtructing him in theſe points, it was ſtill far exceeded by a regard for his morals. He had imbibed the ſeeds of virtue from his birth; and the af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectionate father took every opportunity of improving them.</p>
                  <p>By theſe means the little family lived in the moſt exalted happineſs, till the youth had attained his fourteenth year, when all their bliſs was deſtroyed by no leſs a calami<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty than the death of the indulgent father; a miſfortune which could only be alleviated by the reſignation with which he met the hand of Providence. Nothing can be im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>agined more affecting than the calmneſs of the father, and the inexpreſſible grief of the mother and her ſon.

calamity: But let me recommend it to you, above all things, to remain dutiful to your mother, and, for my ſake, be to her both a ſon and a huſband, that ſhe may experience at the ſame time your duty and protection." He would have ſaid more; but finding his ſpirits faint, he ended with. "Remember theſe my laſt words when I am gone; a few minutes will remove me from you; adieu forever, adieu." He had ſcarce uttered theſe words, when with a Chriſtian calm<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs he expired.</p>
                  <p>His widow and her unfortunate orphan, conſoled each other as well as this important event would permit them. No grief could recal the departed parent; and they now began to turn their eyes on their own con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition. A relation, who was a tradeſman in Philadelphia, and had no family of his own, had often deſired to have Florio to town in his father's life time, which the tender father could never be brought to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply with. However, on the news of the clergyman's death, the generous Altamont flew to S—, and prevailed on the afflict<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed mother to part with her ſon, promiſing to adopt him for his own. This was an unex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected ſtroke to her; to loſe her huſband, and now to be deprived of her ſon, was more than ſhe could well bear: But recol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lecting it was not in her power to make a
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:033533_0012_0FF778ECE1170DD8"/>
proviſion for Florio equal to his merit, ſhe at length conſented to Altamont's propoſals, who ſet out ſoon after for town, overjoyed with his adopted ſon.</p>
                  <p>The mother, as ſhe had lived very frugal during the life of her huſband, had ſaved a little money, which, as her ſon was ſo well provided for, ſhe laid out in an eſtate, and, for the ſake of cheapneſs, retired farther in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the country, where ſhe kept up a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant correſpondence with her ſon, whoſe dutiful letters were the greateſt comfort of her life.</p>
                  <p>Florio, daily experienced freſh inſtances of the diſintereſted friendſhip of his bene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ctor; and now the bleſſings of proſperity ſeemed again to ſmile upon him. His only ſtudy was to pleaſe his generous patron, who amply recompenſed his aſſiduity by the moſt grateful acknowledgments. In this manner he ſpent near three years in the moſt perfect felicity; but this bliſs was too great to be permanent.</p>
                  <p>The affairs of Altamont required his preſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence at a little eſtate he had in the country; and as he knew his buſineſs in town would be faithfully tranſacted by Florio, he propoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed ſtaying a month or two in the country; but not chooſing to leave the care of his houſe to a young woman, he invited the wid<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ow of his friend Lothario to ſtay in it during
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:033533_0013_0FF778EF749B5C88"/>
his abſence as he was certain he might depend on her prudence in managing his family.</p>
                  <p>Having thus ſettled every thing to his mind, the generous Altamont ſet out on his intended journey with great ſatisfaction; but alas! little dreamt of the dreadful chain of miſeries which were ſo ſoon to follow.</p>
                  <p>The widow of Lothario was left with two ſmall children, both boys, and a very ſcanty proviſion to maintain them; one of them, however ſurvived his father but a ſhort time; the other was maintained by the generoſity of ſome friends, at a boarding ſchool in the country: Yet, notwithſtanding the expenſes of her children being taken off, the unfortu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nate Raphelia could ſcacre ſupport herſelf on her trifling income. This Altamont knew and for that reaſon invited her to the care of his houſe.</p>
                  <p>She was naturally of an agreeable temper; and notwithſtanding all her misfortunes, the beauty of her face was not totally van<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſhed. Her affability ſoon procured her the eſteem of Florio, which on her ſide was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paid by the moſt affectionate regard. She frequently with a flood of tears related to him the happineſs ſhe once enjoyed with her loved Lothario, and the miſeries ſhe had ſince his death experienced. This could not fail of working on the benevolent diſpoſition of Florio; he endeavoured to
<pb n="15" facs="unknown:033533_0014_0FF778F2481B6C98"/>
conſole her anxiety, but in vain; he remonſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trated to her the crime of murmuring at the diſpenſations of Providence; but to that ſhe was entirely inattentive; and often, in the innocent ſimplicity of his heart, knelt down before her, and earneſtly requeſted her, in that moving poſture, to deſiſt from her uneaſineſs. This goodneſs ſerved only to increaſe, inſted of alleviating, the grief of Raphelia. She raiſed up the compaſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ate youth, and tenderly embracing him, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turned him her moſt grateful thanks for his pity, the tears trickling all the while from both their eyes. This friendſhip imper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceptibly increaſed into the moſt ardent love. But now, reader, it is time to throw a veil on theſe unhappy lovers. Let it ſuffice to ſay that in an ill fated hour they were both ruined, though it is hard to tell which was the ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

In ſhort, they indulged their criminal love till the return of Altamont, who, in his jour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ney, had paid a viſit to the mother of Florio, and greatly comforted her with the character he gave of the promiſing youth her ſon.</p>
                  <p>The intrigue of Florio had never been ſuſpected by the ſervants, as the age of Ra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phelia gave a ſanction to any little liberty taken before them. Upon Altamont's arri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>val, and inquiry into the ſtate of his affairs, he found all his buſineſs had been exactly
<pb n="16" facs="unknown:033533_0015_0FF778F496756B90"/>
performed according to his directions; nor was he leſs pleaſed with a review of the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meſtick care of Raphelia, which he ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged by a handſome preſent.</p>
                  <p>Though ſhe was now removed from Flo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rio, he ſtill purſued her to her lodgings, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>known to Altamont or his family; till one evening when he went as uſual, he found her in tears. This he could not bear, and immediately requeſted the reaſon of them: But judge, reader, what muſt be his ſurpriſe, when ſhe declared herſelf pregnant! This was a thought which had entered neither of their heads, ſhe thinking herſelf ſecure by age, and he by youth. They were now diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſſed indeed; but as one crime uſually brings on another, he reſolved to fly from the ſhame which he ſaw approaching. Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſembling his mind, however, before her, (a thing which till then he had never been guilty of) he endeavoured to comfort her as well as he could, promiſing to call on her the nex day.</p>
                  <p>He left the room, but without intending ever to ſee it again; and immediatly fled his native country, and arrived at Briſtol, where he entered on board a privateer, fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting out for the Weſtindies. They had not been out long, before they met with a French frigate, which the captain reſolved to board. Florio, deſperate with affliction, was per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted
<pb n="17" facs="unknown:033533_0016_0FF778F61B64EC98"/>
to be of the number appointed to board her, and ſoon appeared upon the deck of the Frenchman, where, overpowered by numbers, he at laſt received a mortal wound, though not before he had given ſeveral him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf. The ſurgeon in vain endeavoured to bleed him, he was too far gone for aſſiſtance, and ſoon after expired. On ſearching his cheſt, a letter was found directed to Alta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mont, filled with the moſt grateful acknowl<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edgments for all his kindneſs, and acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing him with the reaſons of his elopement. This was conveyed to him<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> and the news ſoon reached the ears of the unfortunate Raphelia, who looking on herſelf as the cauſe of his death, took the horrid reſolution of deſtroying both herſelf and her unborn infant by poiſon, thinking to expiate her guilt by the horrid cr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>"MY father had two children, a daughter and myſelf.

Perhaps nature has formed the par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ental ſenſibility, infinitely more exquiſite than the filial, and, for ſome wiſe purpoſe, implanted a much greater fondneſs on our minds for thoſe we beget and educate, than for thoſe by whom we are begotten and ed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ucated ourſelves; at leaſt cuſtom has firmly eſtabliſhed ſuch different ſentiments relative to the behavour of parent and child, that it

is thought a matter of the higheſt praiſe in a wealthy ſon to ſettle a paltry fifty pound for life on a diſtreſſed and worthy father; but an action of little or no merit in a father to ſettle twenty times the ſum upon an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent ſon. I ſupped laſt night at my ſiſter Rattle's, where I generally hear ſomething new, and was entertained by my nephew Harry, with the following exception to the foregoing poſition, which I flatter myſelf will prove no diſagreeable relation to my readers.</p>
                  <p>An eminent merchant, whoſe name I think neceſſary to conceal under that of Webley, married a moſt amiable woman, with whom he received a conſiderable fortune, and by whom he was bleſt in the firſt year with a daughter, called Marria: Mrs. Webley however unhappily catching a cold during the time of her lying in, did not long ſurvive the birth of her child, but died in about three months after; with her laſt breath conjuring her huſband to be particularly at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentive to the welfare of the unfortunate little Maria.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Webley for two years before his mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riage had been connected with a ſubtle de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigning woman, by whom he alſo had a daughter, nor did his having a wife put an end to the guilty intercourſe: Under pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of important buſineſs, he frequently
<pb n="24" facs="unknown:033533_0023_0FF7790B07513AE0"/>
ſtaid in town with her a night or two in the week, while Mrs. Webley was down at the country houſe in Hertfordſhire; and as frequently carried her into the country with him, whenever he knew his lady could not conveniently leave town:— His marriage, in fact, was rather an engagement of intereſt, than a union of inclination; and Mrs. Webley's fortune enabling him to live up to the ſummit of his wiſhes, the moment ſhe was interred, he thought there was no far<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther neceſſity for reſtraint or diſguiſe.— In ſhort, ſix weeks had ſcarcely elapſed, when he married the abandoned woman we have been ſpeaking of, and pitched upon the moſt profligate of her ſex, to ſupply the place of the very beſt.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall paſs over the time of Maria's infancy, when ſhe experienced little more than the diminutive cruelty of a narrow minded mother in law, and come at once to that period which may be juſtly reckoned the moſt important of her life: She had juſt entered on her eighteenth year, and was blooming into all the perfections of her ſex, when Mrs. Webley began to think of exe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cuting a ſcheme which ſhe had long in agi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tation.—She ſaw Maria treated by every body with the greateſt reſpect, and beheld her own daughter, though dreſt out in all the faſhionable ſoppery of the times, and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely
<pb n="25" facs="unknown:033533_0024_0FF7790D92FB3508"/>
more attended to, received with a degree of inſipid civilty, that bordered up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on contempt. The ſhameful neglect which Maria experienced at home, gave a conſtant luſtre to her merit when abroad, and if ſhe found no kind of countenance in her own family, ſhe met with the higheſt in every other place.—This was a circumſtance which galled Mrs. Webley to the very ſoul, and being moreover fearful that the regard ſo univerſally ſhewn to Maria, would be a means of obſtructing any favourable ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dreſſes which might be made to her own daughter, ſhe took a ſpeedy opportunity of quarrelling with that unhappy young lady, and being as the generality of thoſe of her principles moſt commonly are, both maſter and miſtreſs of the houſe, very fairly turn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her out of doors. Maria was not how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever deſtitute of a protector, though ſhe had loſt a father. A young fellow, with a good underſtanding and a ſplendid eſtate, who had long ſolicited her favourable opinion, and gained it, took that opportunity of preſſing for her hand, and was made the hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pieſt of men.</p>
                  <p>Maria was married about five years, dur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing which time, though ſhe had often en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treated for a reconciliation, ſhe never could be admitted to the preſence of her father; when taking up the Gazette, one Saturday
<pb n="26" facs="unknown:033533_0025_0FF7790F174AC8A8"/>
evening, ſhe met with his name amongſt the liſt of bankrupts, and inſtantly fainted on the floor: She was however ſoon brought to herſelf, when forgetting in a moment how ſhe had been turned out upon the char<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity of an inhoſpitable world, and expoſed to the moſt pinching poverty and diſgrace: how for a ſeries of years ſhe had been treat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed as an alien to her father's family, and even denied the moſt trivial neceſſaries, while ſtrangers were rioting on her mother's fortune; ſhe flew to her huſband, whoſe happineſs was centered in obliging her, and pointing out the miſerable ſituation of her father, obtained his conſent to ſettle three hundred a year out of a ſum which he would allow her for pin money, on him, to alleviate ſo diſtreſſing an incident: With this ſhe immediately took coach, and proceeded to her father's; the door was now thrown open at her approach; and being introduc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the old gentleman's preſence, they gazed upon one another for ſome moments, and then burſt into a mutual flood of tears.</p>
                  <p>Mr. Webley's misfortunes had opened his eyes to the ſtrangeneſs of his conduct, and nobody could be more ready to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demn it than himſelf. What then muſt we judge his emotions to be, when a daughter, whom he had leſt deſtitute of bread, came to offer him a genteel allowance for life;
<pb n="27" facs="unknown:033533_0026_0FF779131935B470"/>
and the ſame eyes which he had ſteeped in tears of the keeneſt diſtreſs, came to fill his with drops of unutterable joy; his grati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tude as a man, his feelings as a father, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantly ruſhed upon his ſoul; he dryed his eyes, looked full in his daughter's face for ſome moments, then capering about the room with the phrenzy of a bedlamite, burſt afreſh into tears. Suffice it, however, that after his affairs were ſettled, he retired into the country, upon this yearly allowance, but did not live long enough to enjoy the firſt quarter: The mortification of being a bankrupt, the conſciouſneſs of his family errors, and finally, the very generoſity of his daughter, which was intended to ſweeten the remainder of his life, proved a means of hurrying him to his end: The agitation of his mind threw the gout into his ſtomach, and he died in Maria's arms, in the fiftieth year of his age. His wife and daughter now thought themſelves utterly undone! but Maria, with a greatneſs of mind peculiar to herſelf, in an inſtant diſpelled their appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions by a continuation of two hundred a year, during her life; and without ever ſtooping to hint any thing of their former behaviour, told them, tha<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>THE greateſt misfortunes that attend women, ariſe from falſe delicacy. If on every emergency the daughter was to look up to the father, the ſiſter to the broth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, or the niece to the uncle, they would in general experience not only proper advice, but if neceſſary, certain protection.

                  <p>Leonora had a brother to whom ſhe was dear as life; ſhe had a lover too who was his intimate friend, and for this lover ſhe en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertained a ſincere paſſion.</p>
                  <p>This gentleman, whom we ſhall call Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus, was left by his father in rather in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digent circumſtances; but Lorenzo, the brother of Leonora, who had formed an at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tachment to him at ſchool, by purchaſe, though he pretended it was by intereſt, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured him a civil employment, ſufficiently competent to ſupport a gentleman.</p>
                  <p>Albertus ſpent all his leiſure hours at the houſe of his friend, and the amiable virtues of Leonora, which animated a beautiful face, ſoon ſubdued his heart by their powerful influence.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="29" facs="unknown:033533_0028_0FF77917E9DC4B18"/>Gratitude combated ſtrongly with paſſion. The obligations he owed Lorenzo, made him reſolve forever to quit the preſence of Leonora, yet he could not prevail on himſelf to depart without communicating the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>This was a trial which required the utmoſt exertions of fortitude: but accident ſoon produced an opportunity.</p>
                  <p>Albertus ſitting one morning in a parlour with Leonora, ſhe received a letter from her brother, which as ſhe peruſed, her hands trembled, her face fluſhed, and at laſt over<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>powered by ſenſibility, ſhe fainted, and fell proſtrate upon a couch on which ſhe fat.</p>
                  <p>Albertus flew to her aſſiſtance—he raiſed her in his arms, and that inſtant a female ſervant entered the room, and drawing a criminal concluſion from the ſituation in which ſhe ſaw the lovers, immediately retir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, unperceived.</p>
                  <p>Leonora on recovering was overwhelmed with confuſion, nor was Albertus in a leſs pitiable ſituation. His ſolicitude, the ten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derneſs of his manner, his joy at her recov<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ery, and a kiſs, which he involuntarily preſſed upon one hand, while with the other ſhe adjuſted her handkerchief, that opened as ſhe fell, convinced her of what ſhe wiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to know, of what Albertus feared to diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cloſe, that ſhe was the object of his love.</p>
                  <p>Having in ſome degree recovered her ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>renity, ſhe reſolved to put the heart of Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bertus

to further proof. She was not ſuch a novice in the knowledge of human nature, as to be ignorant of the effect of beauty, and the agitation of Albertus might have been the conſequence of ſenſual paſſion. She therefore put the letter in his hand—he read, he ſighed—he looked on her, and wept.</p>
                  <p>"I am convinced, ſaid Leonora to her<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he loves me—You muſt meet me, ſaid ſhe, addreſſing Albertus, in a couple of hours in the garden, for I am reſolved to be guided by your advice in this buſineſs"—and ſhe left him abruptly.</p>
                  <p>This letter was from the brother of Leo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nora. It informed her that a perſon of great fortune had propoſed a tender of his heart.</p>
                  <p>Albertus took his reſolution, which was not to impede the elevation of Leonora.— "my advice to her" ſaid he, with a deep <gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>With this Jane, Lorenzo had carried on an illicit connection; ſhe was of a malign

The ſculpture repreſents a dog fighting with a champion, and was occaſioned by the fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing circumſtances.</p>
                  <p>Aubri de Mondridier, a gentleman of fam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ily and fortune, travelling along through the foreſt of Bondi, was murdered, and bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried under a tree.

                  <p>The ſingularity of all the actions of the dog; his coming there without his maſter, whoſe faithful companion he always had been; the ſudden diſappearance of his maſter: and, perhaps, that divine diſpenſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of juſti<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

Whenever he ſaw him after<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards, the dog purſued and attacked him with equal fury. Such obſtinate virulence in the animal, confined only to Macaire, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peared extraordinary to thoſe perſons who recollected the dog's fondneſs for his maſter, and at the ſame time ſeveral inſtances where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in Macaire had diſplayed his envy and hat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red to Aubri de Mondridier.</p>

Notwithſtanding ſhe was in tatters, and disfigured with duſt, her eyes were brilliant and expreſſive. The youth was captivated with ſo uncommon an object, and his humanity pleaded powerful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in her favour. What, ſaid he to himſelf, ſhould hinder me of being ſerviceable to this unhappy object! Perhaps her perſon might make her fortune; I ſhould then make two happy. After this ſhort ſoliloquy he enquired where her parents lived? She replied, I am an orphan, Sir; a neighbour took me into her houſe, and I endeavour to get a bit of bread that I may not be ſent to the workhouſe.</p>
                  <p>But you would be much better there than as you are now.</p>

child, if you like it, I will take care of you in future; I will provide you a miſtreſs, who ſhall cloathe and inſtruct you in ſome buſineſs more creditable; and all I require of you is, to profit by the expenſe I ſhall be at on your account.</p>
                  <p>The little creature, delighted with the offer, begs to ſhew him her houſe. He ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>companies her to a fruiterer's, where he learnt her docility and application. This poor, but induſtrious woman, had taken care to have her taught reading and writing; and here he found that this orphan was the daughter of an exciſeman, who died in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treme indigence, and that her name was Louiſa Paſſementier.</p>
                  <p>Our new Pygmalion pleaſed with this in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, intimated his views reſpecting Louiſa, agreed to allow her a certain annual ſum for the time ſhe had taken this orphan into her houſe, and ordered her to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cently cloathed.</p>

perſon who had made her ſo happy. Mr. De M — was delighted. He ſignified his pleaſure of breakfaſting with Louiſa and the two women; he then conducted her to a reputable milliner's where ſhe found a new miſtreſs, that was the modle of taſte, regularity, and good breeding.</p>
                  <p>Madam, ſaid Mr. De M —, I here bring you a young apprentice. Be not ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priſed that ſhe is unaccompanied by a wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man; ſhe is an orphan, and I, who am her guardian, am ſtill a bachelor.

I have not a doubt but you will find her worthy your attentions, and that ſhe will love your daughters as if they were her ſiſters. In taking his leave he obſerved to this lady, that he ſhould never deſire to ſee her alone, or to take her out unleſs accompanied by her or her daughters. This arrangement meeting the entire approbation of her miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treſs, Louiſa was immediately taken into her family and highly careſſed.</p>
                  <p>Mr. De M— had declined taking with him the fruiterer and mantua m<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="40" facs="unknown:033533_0038_0FF7793094EDB250"/>
ſtate of miſery in which he had found this unfortunate orphan. He was ſome time without ſeeing his adopted ward, and upon his paying the ſecond quarter for her board, he was ſurpriſed with her progreſs. She had already acquired an air, which render<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed her pretty face ſtill more intereſting; and her modeſty in ſeeing her benefactor, gave her additional charms.</p>
                  <p>Mr. De M — could not help exclaim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to himſelf, happy Pygmalion! The gods animated thy ſtatue; render them divine honours, and reſpect their preſent! He then ſeated himſelf oppoſite to Louiſa, and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſed with her in the reſpectful language of a guardian to his ward, in order to inſpire her with an elevation of ſentiment. In a private converſation, her miſtreſs ſaid ſhe was a treaſure of beauty, ſenſe, and ſenſibility. Louiſa, ſir, is all ſweetneſs and condeſcen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion. She ſeems thoroughly ſenſible that ſhe owes her preſent happineſs to your atten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions. Her addreſs is uncommon and gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious; and her docility and comprehenſion ſurpriſing for her age. Mr. De M — left the houſe in a kind of rapture. Happy Pygmalion! What a beautiful ſtatue has the bounty of the gods animated by thy care and aſſiduity!</p>
                  <p>The following evening he was ſomething earlier in his viſit; and brought with him a pretty preſent, conſiſting of a pair of ear<g ref="char:EOLunhyphen"/>rings,
<pb n="41" facs="unknown:033533_0039_0FF7793329DC0C98"/>
a necklace, a pair of bracelets, with a pair of handſome ſhoebuckles, incloſed in an etui made of gold.</p>
                  <p>I wiſh, Miſs Louiſa, to give you an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtance of my friendſhip, by preſenting you with theſe trifles; and by ſo doing I hope to gain a place in your's.</p>
                  <p>You have no neceſſity, ſir, to have re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe to ſuch expedients, ſince the favours I have already received, will never be effac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed from my memory.</p>
                  <p>You are, I believe, as good as you are lovely. I often ſpeak of you to Miſs Hen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rietta Monclar, (her miſtreſs eldeſt daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter) ſhe ſays you are my guardian angel; and were I to tell her all—</p>
                  <p>No, Louiſa; that ſecret muſt remain where it is. You muſt forget it as faſt as you can.</p>
                  <p>Forget it, ſir! That's impoſſible. If I dared to tell you what I think —</p>
                  <p>Why not, my dear Louiſa?</p>
                  <p>It is, ſir, that for ſome months paſt, on re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flecting on the ſtate from which you have taken me, I tremble with horror; particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>larly ſo, when I compare it with my preſent ſituation.</p>
                  <p>Theſe reflections are ſingular for one of your age, Louiſa.</p>
                  <p>I had a mother, ſir, that was as kind as ſhe was affectionate, and was very capable
<pb n="42" facs="unknown:033533_0040_0FF7793592BB0F28"/>
of bringing me up; and I ſtill remember thoſe things ſhe taught me.</p>

                  <p>Ah, ſir! This is too fine for a poor or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phan.</p>
                  <p>If theſe articles are too fine for an orphan, they are not ſo for my daughter—yes, Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa, it is the name my heart avows; and ſince I have taken the title of father, I ſhall moſt ſedulouſly diſcharge all its duties. Be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore free from any inquietudes; your hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs will be a duty and a pleaſure to me.</p>
                  <p>Mr. De M—, admiring the work he had undertaken, could not refrain from articu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating—Heavens! how beautiful is that creature grown! If I had ever ſeen ſo love<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly an object among the circle of my acquaint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, could I refrain from adoring her?</p>
                  <p>The next day an unexpected affair prevent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him from ſeeing Louiſa. He was obliged to ſet out immediately for one of his eſtates in the country, where his preſence was abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lutely neceſſary. Here he was detained for ſix months; and during this interval, he received no leſs than two letters from his ward, incloſed in th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Mr. De M— was extremely affected with his ward's attachment. As ſoon as his affairs were ſufficiently arranged, he haſten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed back to the capital, where he found Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa in the blooming charms of all conquer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing fifteen. Her beauty now made a forci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble impreſſion upon his heart. He felt its powers, and began to feel its conſequences. His viſits became more ſeldom, yet he could not diveſt himſelf of his feelings. Louiſa, on her part, became paſſionately fond of her protector; and as ſhe ſaw no harm in giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing way to her penchant, ſhe expreſſed herſelf, on all occaſions, with a <hi>naievete</hi> that was irreſiſtibly ſeductive.</p>
                  <p>One evening, after a ſerious reflection, Mr. De M—appeared in the preſence of Louiſa, with a cloud hanging on his brow. She drew near to him, and with an accent of the livelieſt concern, ſaid, dear ſir, you ſeem to have ſome cauſe of uneaſineſs— would to heaven I could relieve you from it—</p>
                  <p>Louiſa, my dear Louiſa, it quits me when I ſee your; but it returns when I am going to leave you.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="45" facs="unknown:033533_0043_0FF7793C310F5B50"/>Ah, dear papa! do not then leave me.—</p>
                  <p>That's impoſſible</p>
                  <p>No, that is not impoſſible. I am yours, I only live, I only breathe, but to be inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental to your happineſs.</p>
                  <p>Lovely creature! Can a daughter at your age content herſelf with living in my houſe?</p>
                  <p>Why not, ſir? Cannot I live with my papa—if it be neceſſary for his repoſe—</p>
                  <p>Louiſa, you are too dear to me, that I ſhould ſo expoſe your reputation.</p>
                  <p>My reputation—dear ſir, explain what you mean.</p>
                  <p>Louiſa, thou art my child, and yet I dare not take thee under my roof. Hear me, dear Louiſa, hear me. I have a name, a title, and a large eſtate; my rank requires that I make an alliance with a family of equal pretenſions; and to make a marriage ſtate happy, it is neceſſary to love the perſon to whom one is united, and I can love no other woman than my Louiſa. This is the reaſon why I am a prey to inquietude. My Louiſa, I adore thee—thou art the work of my hands; I have, in fact, called thee into exiſtence; and I love thee as a father, a brother, and a lover. I ſhall be wretched without thee; I ſhall be a monſter if I abuſe thy innocence; and, if I marry thee, my family will hold me in execration. This is my ſituation, thou too bewitching creature.
<pb n="46" facs="unknown:033533_0044_0FF7794096127B70"/>
Pity me; it is all that thy too enamoured friend requeſts.</p>
                  <p>During this diſcourſe, Louiſa was a prey to a thouſand new ideas; ſhe ſcarce compre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hended the l<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>nguage of her protector; it was, to her, a chaos of incoherent ſentiments.</p>
                  <p>Can I poſſibly make him wretched who has rendered me ſo completely happy! Can I then do nothing for him who has treated me as his daughter! Certainly I can; but you conceal it from me through a motive of generoſity. Will you not then relieve me from this cruel perplexity;—</p>
                  <p>Louiſa, my kind Louiſa, my affectionate daughter, ſince you are the choice of my heart, be tranquillized; my reaſon will ſug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>geſt a remedy for my preſent ſituation.— Adieu, I will ſee you again tomorrow.</p>
                  <p>Mr. De M— after this viſit was plung<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed into a painful irreſolution.</p>
                  <p>Shall I marry Louiſa! My heart ſays yes; but the world, reaſon, prudence, the age in which I live, put a negative to the meaſure. My family, my relations, my friends, oppoſe ſuch an union.</p>
                  <p>Inſtead of flying from the object of his affection, he reſolved to ſee her every day, and accuſtom himſelf to her poiſon, in order to bid defiance to its malignity. And thus he reaſoned: Louiſa is a fever; this diſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der ſhould then be treated as ſuch. The be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning
<pb n="47" facs="unknown:033533_0045_0FF7794219E29640"/>
is in a manner imperceptible, but the criſis violent in the laſt degree; after this it diminiſhes inſenſibly. I muſt then ſuffer with courage; the victory will be crowned with happy conſequences, and there will be left no room for repentance!</p>
                  <p>This line of conduct being adopted, Mr. De M— was regular in his viſits; and Louiſa was the happieſt of women. The paſſion made a rapid progreſs in the heart of the guardian; who endeavoured, like a phi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>loſopher, to combat its efforts.</p>
                  <p>This conduct of the guardian and his ward, ſoon opened the eyes of Madam Mon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clar. Louiſa made no myſtery of her in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations; on the contrary, all her words and actions demonſtrated the fervour of her feelings. In his abſence, her ſighs, her tears, revealed the ſtate of her heart, and her joy was no leſs conſpicuous in ſeeing him.— That boſom, virtuous and ſuſceptible, was alive to all the ardour of the moſt glowing paſſion, united to gratitude, eſteem, reſpect, and attachment.</p>
                  <p>My dear child, ſaid Madam Monclar, I fear you love too well your guardian. Take care! for his partiality may one day be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come fatal to your repoſe.</p>
                  <p>Ah, madam! that cannot be; for every thing which relates to Mr. De M— muſt be inſtrumental to my happineſs.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="48" facs="unknown:033533_0046_0FF77944DA03BAA0"/>But child, he may be induced to marry.</p>
                  <p>If madam, he ſhould experience his felicity in that ſtate, I ſhall rejoice in his good fortune. In that caſe he might per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps be induced to make me a companion to his lady, whom I ſhould love with the greateſt tenderneſs.</p>
                  <p>If theſe are your ſentiments, Louiſa, I have nothing farther to ſay.</p>
                  <p>This converſation was related to Mr. De M— word for word. He confeſſed the ardour of his affection, yet was irreſolute in the conduct he ought to purſue.</p>
                  <p>To make her my wife is certainly the nobleſt procedure—and perhaps the moſt prudent, ſince my happineſs hinges on the event. But my family—the world—the court, will ſee with different eyes. She has an honeſt parentage, and if I were but a private gentleman, I could marry her with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out ſlander or detraction: As I am now ſit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uated, my heirſhip to titles and diſtinctions, requires that I make choice of a woman a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mong the higher order of <hi>nobleſſe,</hi> or one whoſe riches can caſt a veil upon her orig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>inal obſcurity. Strange and unnatural pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>judice! The world will applaud me for eſpouſing the daughter of a vile financier, who has fattened upon the ſpoils and exac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of whole provinces; yet the model of virtue and female perfection in a more hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble
<pb n="49" facs="unknown:033533_0047_0FF77947C7544438"/>
line of life, is deemed unworthy of my regards.</p>
                  <p>Sir, your conduct to Louiſa to this very hour, is that of a man of the niceſt honour; conſult but your own heart, for that is the only counſellor you ſhould—</p>
                  <p>That heart, madam, will inſtantly declare in favour of Louiſa. But I will conſult this lovely creature in perſon; I will ſhew her what can be ſaid for and againſt a meaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ure of this nature; and by this means I ſhall hear the advice of beautiful nature in all her purity.</p>
                  <p>Having ſaid this, he deſired to ſpeak with Louiſa in private.</p>
                  <p>I am come, my dear Louiſa, to conſult you on an object of the laſt importance to my future peace of mind: that object is re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſp<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>Mr. De M — embraced the firſt oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunity of ſpeaking to his lady relative to
<pb n="53" facs="unknown:033533_0051_0FF779532A02A380"/>
his adopted daughter, who readily ſeconded his views, by requeſting he would bring her home as ſoon as he thought proper.</p>
                  <p>Lady De M— received Louiſa with every mark of reſpect and eſteem. She was about the ſame age, lately come from a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent, and therefore conſidered her viſitor as an agreeable companion, without the leaſt mixture of jealouſy of her charms, ſince her perſon was equally handſome and attractive.</p>
                  <p>The firſt eight days this young family paſſed in the moſt agreeable manner poſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſible; but this harmony was interrupted by the Counteſs, who obſerved the great famil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iarity that paſſed between theſe beautiful women, and taking her daughter aſide, ſaid, ſhe was aſtoniſhed that her huſband gave her one of his miſtreſſes for her companion; at the ſame time menaced, that if this ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rangement continued, ſhe ſhould be provok<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to ſue for a ſeparation.</p>
                  <p>Lady De M— aſtoniſhed at this lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage, endeavoured to undeceive her moth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, by particulariſing every thing that had paſſed, and the cautions which her huſband had taken to prevent the leaſt miſunder<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding. She went even farther, and told her, that it was Louiſa's advice that deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined her protector to marry.</p>
                  <p>Without doubt, my child, for they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>certed together the arrangement which has
<pb facs="unknown:033533_0052_0FF77959DB6B41B0"/>
now taken place; and I poſitively enjoin you to oppoſe it in future, otherwiſe I ſhall deſpiſe you as much as I now do your ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcure campanion.</p>
                  <p>Lady De M— prudently concealed from Louiſa this diſagreeable ſcene! but ſhe took the firſt opportunity of communicat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it to her huſband. He ſaw the ſtorm gathering; nevertheleſs, he begged his lady to continue her friendſhip to Louiſa, adding, that he would get his mother to clear up matters to the Counteſs' ſatisfaction.</p>
                  <p>In this interval, the Counteſs plotted the ruin of this innocent creature; and in a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother converſation with her daughter, ſhe was mortified to hear her declare, that Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa was a reſpectable and amiable character, and that ſhe would obey her huſband's in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junctions in this and in all other circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances. The counteſs was tranſported with rage, left the room abruptly; and as ſhe had a miniſter among the number of her friends<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> ſhe obtained an order to take the perſon of Louiſa, and ſhut her up in priſon.</p>
                  <p>This order, ardently ſolicited, was obtain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and executed the ſame day; for before midnight a violent knocking was heard at the door, <hi>de la part du Roi.</hi> The porter ran to inform his maſter, and to take his orders. Lady De M — alarmed for her friend, and knowing the violent temper of her mother<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> divined the cauſe.</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="55" facs="unknown:033533_0053_0FF77B1A9276E9D8"/>Sir, this unhappineſs is terrible for me, and ſtill more ſo for Louiſa. This proce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dure might endanger my felicity—but a thought has juſt ſtruck me, and you muſt ſwear before I reveal it, you will not pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent its execution. The bearer of this or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der does not know me, let me therefore aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſume the name of Louiſa. Tomorrow they will repent of having iſſued this unjuſt and cruel order. Withdraw into your own a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>partment, after you have requeſted the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>empt to treat his priſoner with that reſpect that ſhe is entitled to; and as ſoon as I am gone, conduct Louiſa to ſome place of ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. Fly to the miniſter, and tell him that your lady is taken from you by a <hi>lettre de cachet.</hi> You ſee my deſign: this is the only expedient to ſave our friend. At this inſtant, the officer deſired to ſee Louiſa: Lady De M— requeſted to know his pleaſure. He informed her, that by the King's orders ſhe muſt accompany them; and they deſcended together.</p>
                  <p>Mr. De M— in the interval, dreſſed himſelf, and with a confidential domeſtick carried off his ward to his mother's. He then flew to the miniſter, who was juſt re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiring to his bed chamber. His name was announced; the miniſter could not ſee him till after repeated meſſages; when he com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plained, that his lady, he ſuppoſed by miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>take,
<pb n="56" facs="unknown:033533_0054_0FF77B1D1E899C98"/>
had been taken out of his houſe, and carried to ſome place of confinement.</p>
                  <p>Sir, the order was not for your lady, but for Mademoiſelle Louiſa Paſſementier.</p>
                  <p>For Louiſa, Sir! who had a right, who has dared—</p>
                  <p>Softly, Sir, your conduct is highly repre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſible.</p>
                  <p>I am ready, Sir, to explain to you my conduct, and to demonſtrate the iniquity of this violence.—</p>
                  <p>While he was ſaying this, the miniſter wrote an order for liberating Lady De M. and ſent a perſon with him to the Madelan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>netes, where they arrived at the ſame inſtant with the Counteſs of Lan**, his mother in law, who was informed of Louiſa's captiv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ity. Mr. De M — trembled at the ſight of the Counteſs, and could ſcarce repreſs the violence of his anger.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall enter together, Madam.</p>
                  <p>We ſhall ſee that preſently.</p>
                  <p>The doors being opened, Mr. De M. pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented his order, and immediately they brought him his lady. Judge the ſurpriſe of the Counteſs in ſeeing Lady De M. Heav<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ens, what is it you, my child, that is <hi>here?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Yes, Madam, and this is my refuge, throw<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing herſelf into the arms of her huſband.— Let us go immediately to Verſailles, and implore the protection of the beſt and moſt
<pb n="57" facs="unknown:033533_0055_0FF77B1EA3BB4EF0"/>
benevolent monarch in the world.</p>
                  <p>This propoſition alarmed the Counteſs; and turning towards Lady De M. I had but one daughter, I adored her—</p>
                  <p>O my dear mother, if you love, let me then be happy. In this union I am com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pletely ſo, ſince Mr. De M. is the beſt and tendereſt of huſbands; and his ward, ſo far from diminiſhing it, encreaſes my felicity. She is at this moment ignorant of what has paſſed, and the extent of my friendſhip to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards her.</p>
                  <p>But, my child, it is indecent to retain a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout your perſon the miſtreſs of your huſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band.</p>
                  <p>She is not his miſtreſs, madam; on the contrary, ſhe is a virtuous and deſerving young creature, that has gained upon my heart by a thouſand good and amiable qual<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ities, and I love her with the ſame cordiali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty as if ſhe were my ſiſter.</p>
                  <p>No, this cannot—ſhall not be—I will move heaven and earth to prevent this ſhock<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing indecorum.</p>
                  <p>Then ſtepping into her carriage, ſhe left them with a countenance that ſpoke diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment and revenge.</p>
                  <p>Mr. De M. and his lady concerted togeth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er how to keep Louiſa in the dark relative to the wicked ſtratagem of the Counteſs: And that they might not ſeem to brave their

mother, thought it prudent that Louiſa ſhould remain in her then ignorance and ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity. The Counteſs ſtill plotted how ſhe might wreck her vengeance, and endeavour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to get her carried off by a ſet of villains. But by the watchful and cautious proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of her ſon in law, ſhe was baffled in her ſcheme. This repeated diſappointment ren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered her furious; and finding any act of violence impracticable, had recourſe to that meaſure, by which the execrable <hi>De Brinſil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liers</hi> terminated the days of her own father. She feigned to be more and more reconcil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; ſhe viſited her daughter, and made the kindeſt enquiries after the object of her im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>placable hatred. This apparent alteration in the Counteſs, induced them to take back Louiſa; and in the courſe of her viſits, ſhe ſhewed her every ma<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>k of attention. At laſt ſhe invited her to paſs a few days at her ſeat, but neither Mr. De M. nor his lady were dupes to this exceſs of civility. The Counteſs obſerved that this did not meet the c<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ncurrence of her children, requeſted they would bring her with them the firſt opportunity. Lady De M. was for Lou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſa's feigning an indiſpoſition: but as ſhe ſeemed deſirous of accompanying them her wiſhes in this reſpect were gratified. On their arrival, Louiſa was received with a thouſand careſſes; while Lady De M. who
<pb n="59" facs="unknown:033533_0057_0FF77B24C27DA260"/>
knew her mother's vindictive temper, was fearful of ſome ſtratagem. She therefore cautioned Louiſa to eat nothing at table but what ſhe helped her to, which ſhe would do in a manner as to give no offence; tell<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing her, that ſhe ſhould know her reaſon at their return: and that if ſhe did not ſcru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pulouſly attend to it, ſhe would never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>give her. The Counteſs, during the firſt ſervice, did not apparently remark this at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention in her daughter; but when the de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſert was brought in ſhe preſented Louiſa with a fine peach, who was going to divide it with Lady De M. but ſhe oppoſed it, giving at the ſame time another to her daughter. Louiſa in this moment, had for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gotten the caution given her by her friend, and was going to eat the peach that was be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore her. Lady De M laughing, ſnatched it up, and gave her own in exchange. The viſible alteration in the Counteſs ſtruck Mr. De M. who, trembling leſt his wife ſhould eat this peach, took it up, and per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceived it had been ſeparated into two parts: This diſcovery augmented his ſuſpicions, and by a ſeeming aukwardneſs let it fall un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der the table. The Counteſs began to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover from her alarm, and the dinner ended without any farther accident. Coffee was ſerved up, when the Counteſs contrived that a particular diſh ſhould be preſented to her
<pb n="60" facs="unknown:033533_0058_0FF77B26453C6888"/>
new viſitor; but Lady De M. continuing the pleaſant<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y of helping her friend, let the cup of coffee ſlide off the waiter. This ſecond attempt being fruſtrated, the Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſs could ſcarce conceal the emotions of her ſoul. In the interval, a favourite lap dog was lapping up the ſpilled coffee. Mr. De M. was the only perſon who had re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>marked this circumſtance, and immediately after the dog was ſeized with convulſions. The Counteſs withdrew to her appartment terrified; Lady De M. fell into a fit.—Her huſband, alarmed, gave immediate orders for their return; when he found the fright had made ſuch an impreſſion on her ſpirits, that ſhe was ſoon after delivered, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came the victim of her guilty mother.</p>
                  <p>The diſtracted huſband flew to the miniſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter, and expoſed the abominable proceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings of his mother in law; who, ſtung with ſhame, remorſe and contrition, put an end to her exiſtence, by the fame guilty means ſhe had adminiſtered to others.</p>
                  <p>For two years Louiſa, as well as Mr. De M. was a prey to the blackeſt melancholy. The grief which the former had ſhewn on every occaſion, made ſo lively an impreſſion on the heart of Mr. De M. that he thought it his duty to recal her to life and exiſtence.</p>
                  <p>I have now an heir to inherit my name, and to tranſmit to poſterity my father's rank
<pb n="61" facs="unknown:033533_0059_0FF77B28CA0DD270"/>

                  <p>Louiſa ordered the carriage to drive to the hotel of the Marquis De M. and as the

                  <p>THE revolutions of government and the ſubverſions of empire which have ſwelled the theme of national hiſtorians<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> have, likewiſe, in every age, furniſhed an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecdote to the biographer, and incident to the noveliſt. The objects of policy or am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bition are generally, indeed, accompliſhed at the expenſe of private eaſe and proſperi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty; while the triumph of arms, like the funeral feſtivity of a ſavage tribe, ſerves to announce ſome recent calamity—the waſte of property, or the fall of families.</p>
                  <p>Thus, the great events of the late war which produced the ſeperation of the Brit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſh empire, and eſtabliſhed the ſovereignty of America, were chequered with ſcenes of private ſorrow, and the ſucceſs of the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending forces was alternately fatal to the peace and order of domeſtick life. The la<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentations of the widow and the orphan, mingled with the ſong of victory; and the fable mantle with which the hand of friend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip cloathed the b<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>HORATIO BLYFIELD was a reſpectable inhabitant of the ſtate of Newyork. Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſs had rewarded his induſtry in trade with an ample fortune; and his mind, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>contaminated by envy and ambition, freely indulged itſelf in the delicious enjoyments of the father and the friend. In the form<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er character he ſuperintended the education of a ſon and a daughter, left to his ſole care by the death of their excellent mother; and in the latter, his benevolence and counſel were uniformily exerciſed for the relief of the diſtreſſed, and information of the illit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erate.</p>
                  <p>His mercantile intercourſe with Great-britan afforded an early opportunity of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving the diſpoſition of that kingdom with reſpect to her colonies; and his knowledge of the habits, tempers, and opinions of the American citizens, furniſhed him with a painful anticipation of anarchy and war.— The texture of his mind, indeed, was nat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urally calm and paſſive, and the ordinary
<pb n="65" facs="unknown:033533_0063_0FF77B3368D7B428"/>
effects of a life of ſixty years duration, had totally eradicated all thoſe paſſions which rouſe men to oppoſition, and qualify them for enterprize. When, therefore, the guant<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>let was thrown upon the theatre of the new world, and the ſpirit of diſcord began to rage, Horatio, like the Roman Atticus, withdrew from publick clamour, to a ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſtered cottage, in the interiour diſtrict of Longiſtand; and, conſecrating the youth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ardour of<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> his ſon, Honorious, to the ſervice of his country, the fair Amelia was the only companion of his retreat.</p>
                  <p>Amelia had then attained her ſeventeenth year. The delicacy of her form was in uniſon with the mildneſs of her aſpect, and the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite harmony of her ſoul, was reſponſive to the ſymmetry of her perſon. The pride of parental attachment had graced her with every accompliſhment that depends upon tuition; and it was the ſingular fortune of Amelia, to be at once the admiration of our ſex, and the favourite of her own. From ſuch a daughter, Horatio could not but re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive every ſolace of which his generous feelings were ſuſceptible in a ſeaſon of na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional calamity; but the din of arms that frequently interrupted the ſilence of the neighbouring foreſts, and the diſaſtrous in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>telligence which his ſon occaſionally tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitted from the ſtandard of the union, ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perſeded
<pb n="66" facs="unknown:033533_0064_0FF777C06DCB6F38"/>
the cheerful avocations of the day, and diſpelled the peaceful ſlumbers of the night.</p>
                  <p>After a retirement of many months, on a morning fatal to the happineſs of Horatio's family, the ſound of artillery announced a battle, and the horſemen who were obſerved galloping acroſs the grounds, proved that the ſcene of action could not be remote.</p>
                  <p>As ſoon, therefore, as the tumult of hoſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tility had ſubſided, Horatio advanced with his domeſticks, to adminiſter comfort and aſſiſtance to the wounded, and to provide a decent interment for the mangled victims of the conflict. In traverſing the deadly field, he perceived an officer, whoſe exhauſted ſtrength juſt ſerved for the articulation of a groan, and his attention was immediately directed to the preſervation of this intereſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing object, who alone, of the number that had fallen, yielded a hope that his compaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſionate exertions might be crowned with ſucceſs. Having bathed, and bound up his wounds, the youthful ſoldier was borne to the cottage; where, in a ſhort time, a ſtrong<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er pulſe, and a freer reſpiration, afforded a flattering pr<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>ſage of returning life.</p>
                  <p>Amelia. who had anxiouſly waited the arrival of her father, beheld, with a mixed ſenſation of horror and pity, the ſpectacle which now accompanied him. She had
<pb n="67" facs="unknown:033533_0065_0FF77B3A2E51BE08"/>
never before ſeen the ſemblance of death, which therefore afflicted her with all the terrors of imagination; and, notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the pallid countenance of the wounded gueſt, he poſſeſſed an elegance of perſon, which, according to the natural operations of female ſenſibility, added ſomething, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>haps, to her commiſeration of his misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunes. When, however, theſe firſt impreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions had paſſed away, the tenderneſs of her nature expreſſed itſelf in the moſt aſſiduous actions for his eaſe and accommodation, and the encreaſing ſymptoms of his recovery, filled her mind with joy and exultation.</p>
                  <p>The day ſucceeding that on which he was introduced to the family of Horatio, his ſervant, who had made an ineffectual ſearch for his body among the ſlain, arrived at the cottage, and diſcovered him to be <hi>Doliſcus,</hi> the only ſon and heir of a noble family in England.</p>
                  <p>When Doliſcus had recovered from the ſenſeleſs ſtate to which he had been reduced (chiefly, indeed, by the great effuſion of blood) the firſt exerciſe of his faculties was the acknowledgment of obligation, and the profeſſion of gratitude. To Horatio he ſpoke in terms of reverence and reſpect; and to Amelia in the more animated language of admiration, which melted at length, into the gentle tone of flattery and love. But
<pb n="68" facs="unknown:033533_0066_0FF77B3BD538DC80"/>
Doliſcus had been reared in the ſchool of diſſipation: and, with all the qualifications which allure and captivate the female heart, he had learned to conſider virtue only as an obſtacle to pleaſure, and beauty merely a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap> an incentive to the gratification of paſſion. His experience ſoon enabled him to diſcover ſomething in the ſolicitude of the artleſs Amelia beyond the dictates of compaſſion and hoſpitality; and, even before his wounds were cloſed, he conceived the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>famous project of violating the purity and tranquillity of a family, to which he was indebted for the prolongation of his exiſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and the reſtoration of his health.— From that very innocence, however, which betrayed her feelings, while ſhe was herſelf ignorant of their ſource, he anticipated the extremeſt difficulty and danger. To im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove the evident predilection of her mind into a fixed and ardent attachment, requir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed not, indeed, a very ſtrenuous diſplay of his talents and addreſs; but the ſacrifice of her honour (which an inſurmountable an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tipathy to matrimonial engagements made neceſſary to the accompliſhment of his pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe) was a taſk that he juſtly foreſaw, could be only executed by the deteſtable agency of perfidy and fraud. With theſe views then he readily accepted the ſolicitations of his unſuſpecting hoſt, and even contrived

conſequences upon Horatio's peace, her own character, and the fate of the innocent being which ſhe bore, and, wiping the uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs tears from her cheek, ſhe reſolved publickly to vindicate her honour, and aſſert her rights. Animated then, with the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portant purpoſe, ſupported by the preſump<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of her marriage, and hoping yet to find Doliſcus in Newyork, ſhe immediately re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paired to that city—but, alas! he was gone! This diſappointment, however, did not de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feat, nor could any obſtacle retard the proſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cution of her deſign: A ſhip that ſailed the ſucceeding day wafted her to Britain, friendleſs and forlorn.</p>
                  <p>Innumerable<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> difficulties and inconven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iences were encountered by the inexperienc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed traveller, but they vaniſhed before the object of her purſuit; and even her en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trance into London, that chaos of clamour and diſſipation, produced no other ſenſations than thoſe which naturally aroſe from her approach to the dwelling of Doliſcus.</p>
                  <p>Amelia recollected that Doliſcus had oft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>en deſcribed the family reſidence to be ſituated in Groſvenor place, and the ſtage, in which ſhe journeyed, ſtopping in the evening at a publick houſe in Piccadilly, ſhe determined, without delay, to pay him her unexpected and unwelcome viſit. The embarraſſed and anxious manner with
<pb n="78" facs="unknown:033533_0068_0FF77B4349780AB0"/>
which ſhe enquired for his houſe, expoſed her to unjuſt ſurmiſe and ſenſeleſs ribaldry; but her grief rendered her incapable of ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervation, and her purity was ſuperiour to inſult.</p>
                  <p>Doliſcus had arrived about a fortnight earlier than Amelia. The title, influence and fortune, which devolved upon him in conſequence of his father's death, had ſwelled his youthful vanity to exceſs, and ſupplied him with a numerous retinue of flatterers and dependants. At the moment that he was liſtening in ecſtacy to that ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile crew, the victim of his arts, the delud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed daughter of the man to whom he was indebted for the preſervation of his life, ſtood trembling at his door. A gentle rap, after an awful pauſe of ſome minutes, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cured her admiſſion. Her memory recog<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nized the features of the ſervant that open<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed the door; but it was not the valet who had attended Doliſcus at the cottage— ſhe remembered not where or when ſhe had ſeen him.</p>
                  <p>After conſiderable ſolicitation the por<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter conſented to call Doliſcus from his com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany, and conducted Amelia into an anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>camber to wait his arrival. A roar of laughter ſucceeded the delivery of her meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage, and the word <hi>aſſignation,</hi> which was repeated on all ſides, ſeemed to renovate the
<pb n="79" facs="unknown:033533_0069_0FF77B44CB109888"/>
wit and hilarity of the table. The gay and gallant hoſt, inflamed with Champaign, was not diſpleaſed at the imputation, but obſerv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed that as a lady was in the caſe, it was un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neceſſary to apologize for a ſhort deſertion of his friends and wine.</p>
                  <p>At the ſight of that lady, however, Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſcus ſtarted. Amelia's countenance was pale and h<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

But Amelia's wrongs having inſpired her with courage, ſhe boldly reproached him with his baſeneſs and perfidy, and demanded a publick and unequivocal acknowledgment of their marriage. In vain he endeavoured to ſoothe and divert her from her purpoſe, in vain to perſuade her to ſilence and delay, his arts had loſt their wonted influence, while the reſtoration of her injured fame and honour abſorbed every faculty of her mind.</p>
                  <p>At length he aſſumed a different tone, a more authoritative manner. "Madam," ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claimed

I have a ſenſe of pity indeed, for your indiſcretion, but none for your paſſion: I would alleviate your afflictions, but I will not ſubmit to your frenzy."— "Wretch!" retorted Amelia, "but that I owe ſomething to a father's peace, I ſhould deſpiſe to call thee huſband."—"<hi>Huſband,</hi>" cried Doliſcus, with a ſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="2 letters">

                  <p>This diſcovery only was wanting for the conſummation of Amelia's miſery. It was ſudden and fatal as the lightning's blaſt— ſhe ſunk beneath the ſtroke.
