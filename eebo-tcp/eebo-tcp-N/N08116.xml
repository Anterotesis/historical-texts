            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>THE PREFACE.</head>
            <p>THE following eſſay is the fruit of ſome ſolitary hours, penned and publiſhed with a ſincere deſire for the reformation of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral claſſes of mankind, who are immerſed in vice and ſenſuality,— of the deſigning and knaviſh,—and the ſtability of every virtuous, and ingenious perſon.</p>
            <p>The manner in which I have thrown my thoughts together, ſeemed to occur the moſt eaſy, and for ſome reaſons appeared to me the moſt eligible.</p>
            <p>I am not ſo vain as to imagine my performance is free from inac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curacies; but ſuch errors as have either eſcaped my notice, or are be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond my weak abilities to amend, I hope my <hi>Candid Reader</hi> will correct and excuſe.</p>
            <p>The perſon who ventures out on the public Stage as an author, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>comes of courſe ſubject to the various criticiſms of his obſervers; the keen invectives of ſatire, and the poiſoned arrows of envy, are illibe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rally dealt againſt his character and productions.—Theſe I am pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pared to receive, with a contempt due to the efforts of malevolence; and, at the ſame time, ſhall not forget to pay a proper reſpect and deference to the criticiſms of candour and ingenuity.</p>
            <p>The poem before you, contains neither the Life nor Opinions of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtram Shandy, the Memoirs of a Gentleman of Pleaſure, or the Amours of a Lady of Quality.—A piece, I muſt confeſs, not ſo well adapted to the genius of the preſent age; an age, in which ſubjects ſerious, important and intereſting, can ſcarce obtain a hearing, are treated with indifference, and forgot, whilſt their authors are ridi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culed as fools, or pitied as enthuſiaſts.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="iv" facs="unknown:010355_0003_0F7EA254C1B3C2B0"/>To treat of the Deity, his attributes, the relation we ſtand in to him, and the indiſpenſable obligation of ſocial and religious duties,— to excite conſiderations on the uncertainty of time, the certainty of death, and the awful approaching deciſion of infinite wiſdom and pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, with a certain claſs of mankind, are deemed enthuſiaſtic ſpecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations, and idle reveries;—the certain ſpecimens of either ignorance, a heated zeal, or of incurable madneſs. A claſs, who<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> to avoid the extreme of ſuperſtition and fanaticiſm, have incautiouſly run into ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſtill more alarming and dangerous, from the borders of Implicit Faith to the confines of Infidelity, from a falſe heated zeal to the coldeſt indifference, and from the auſterities of a penance to the moſt relaxed licentious indulgence. Be ours to walk in the happy medium of truth, and of right reaſon; the medium between the zeal-leſs and zealot, or indifference and preſumption; and let the deluded of both extremes become the objects of our pity, and be remembered in our prayers.</p>
            <p>You of every rank, degree, and circumſtance in life, into whoſe hand this may fall, as rational and accountable beings, improve the few, fleeting moments of your continuance in this mode of exiſtence, in matters of infinite conſequence; conſider ſeriouſly the important buſineſs of life, acquaint yourſelves with the various branches of a Chriſtian's duty, and diſcharge them with integrity.</p>
            <p>Remember time is ſhort; life altogether uncertain; and that death is inevitable. The time is approaching, when the ſable mantle of af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction will be caſt over all the pomp of a court, the glitter of a ball, and the ludicrous ſcenes of a comedy. The period, the awful period is haſtening, when from life will be exhauſted all its balm, and from terreſtrial objects their power of pleaſing — when every enjoyment will become inſipid, except the complacent notice of <hi>uncreated excellence,</hi> the teſtimony of a good <hi>conſcience,</hi> and the aſſurance of a happy futurity. Devote then your days, ſhould they be few or many, to the ſervice of <hi>Him,</hi> who hath called us to glory and virtue. Let not the enchanting ſcene of illuſive pleaſures, the influence of bad example, or the incitement of the libertine, prevail on you to run with the heedleſs multitude to do evil; walk penſive with the few on the ſide of virtue, acquit yourſelves as men, and as Chriſtians, and the lot of your inheritance will be with the juſt;—for, <hi>Verily there is a reward for the righteous, verily there is a God who judgeth the earth.</hi>
