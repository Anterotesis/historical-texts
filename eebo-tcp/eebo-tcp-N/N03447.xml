            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">T</seg>HO' it is the want of Wiſdom, in the divine ſenſe of it, that hath introduced Arms, or <hi>weapons of War</hi> into the world, for there are no wars where wiſdom ſhines and reigns in perfection; and there had been no <hi>Wars</hi> in theſe lower Regions, where all things were created in beau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiful Order and Harmony, had not Man unhappily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>volted from his Allegiance to his Maker, and loſt the <hi>knowledge</hi> of Him who is the fountain and Centre of all Righteouſneſs, peace and bleſſedneſs; —yet not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding, in the preſent ſtate of things, and the Condition to which Man is now ſubjected, Arms are very needful and very conſiſtent with <hi>Wiſdom</hi> in the ſtricteſt Senſe, and they are mutually ſubſervient.</p>
            <p>If Men muſt be diveſted of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which is their greateſt Excellency, in order to their becoming warri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ours, or if handling <hi>weapons of War</hi> were inconſiſtent with wiſdom, they would ſurely ill become the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> and as ill, the <hi>Miniſters</hi> of CHRIST to ſay any thing in their behalf; for <hi>Wiſdom</hi> ſhould be <hi>juſtified of all her Children.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="2" facs="unknown:004210_0004_100401BE3729C7C8"/>When the wiſe Man (as in the <hi>Text)</hi> compares <hi>Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> with <hi>weapons of War,</hi> and gives the former the preference, it is not with deſign to diſparage them, (for he honours them in the very compariſon) but his deſign is to <hi>commend Wiſdom</hi>; and it would be but a ſlender Commendation, if the thing to which it is compared were not good, or of but <hi>little worth</hi> and ſignificancy.</p>
            <p>This Aphoriſm of <hi>Solomon</hi> is grounded on his obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation and Experience, from the notable Inſtance he mentions, v. 13,—15. <hi>This wiſdom have I ſeen under the Sun, and it ſeem'd great unto me: There was a little City, and few Men in it; and there came a great King againſt it and beſieged it, and built great Bulwarks againſt it; now there was found in it a poor wiſe Man, and he by his wiſdom delivered the City.</hi> — This has been thought by ſome, a <hi>Parable,</hi> but it ſeems more proba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble to have been a Caſe in fact, in ſome Neighbouring Country, of a poor Man who by ſome wiſe Counſel was the happy means of ſaving a City when beſieged by a numerous Army of a potent King, (like the Woman of <hi>Abel,</hi> 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 20.16.)—<q>But ſuch was their Ingratitude, that the poor Man is forgotten, no notice taken, nor recompence made him, nor honour put upon him <note n="*" place="bottom">
                     <hi>Mr.</hi> Henry.</note>.</q> But yet the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> was uſeful and excellent: It muſt and ever will be ſo, which makes a Man a bleſſing to his <hi>City,</hi> his <hi>Country.— Wiſdom is better than ſtrength.</hi>— For that may be effected by <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> which cannot be accompliſh'd by <hi>ſtrength.</hi>— It is <hi>better than weapons of War,</hi>—whether offenſive or defenſive, for without wiſdom there can be no right uſe of them, nor will any Succeſs be likely to attend them. Even in the midſt of Arms, the moſt notable atchievements and victories have been obtained by <hi>wiſe ſtratagems.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <pb n="3" facs="unknown:004210_0005_10042247E69CB460"/>—The words are a diſtinct <hi>Propoſition,</hi> and need not to be caſt into any other form of <hi>Doctrine,</hi> or if you will pleaſe to have them rather, thus,</p>
            <p>Doct. That <hi>tho' weapons of War are good and uſeful unto Men, yet Wiſdom is more uſeful and excellent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>In the handling of them, I propoſe to conſider,</p>
            <p n="1">I. That <hi>weapons of War are good and ſerviceable unto Men,</hi> in the preſent State of things.</p>
            <p n="2">II. — The <hi>preference or ſuperiour excellency of Wiſdom.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="1">I. To Conſider, <hi>ſomething of the uſefulneſs and benefit of weapons of War.</hi>— And by them I underſtand any regular <hi>Military Force, Arms, Forts, Caſtles</hi> or other warlike preparations.</p>
            <p>When I aſſert the uſefulneſs and benefit of weapons of War, the <hi>lawfulneſs</hi> of them is implied; and this may alſo be very juſtly aſſerted: Notwithſtanding it has been (I am well aware) diſputed and denied by <hi>Socinus</hi> and his Followers, and is, at this Day, by ſome <hi>Enthuſiaſts,</hi> who have drank in this, with a confuſed medley of other Errors; thro' a miſunderſtanding or perverſion of ſome paſſages of <hi>Scripture.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>None indeed can deny but that <hi>Wars and Fightings came from the Luſts of Men.</hi> (Jam. 4.1.) And that if <hi>Adam</hi> had retained the Rectitude of his primitive State, in which he had the beautiful Image of God his Maker inſtamp'd upon him, in <hi>Knowledge, Righteouſneſs and Holineſs,</hi> with an eſtabliſh'd <hi>Rule and Dominion,</hi> given him by his munificent Creator, <hi>over all Creatures in this lower world</hi>; there would have been no occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion for Armies and Battles. As the Creatures would have continued in their ſubjection to their Lord, ſo Mankind being juſt and holy, muſt needs have con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinued in <hi>perfect amity</hi>; there would have been no Jars nor diſcords in the <hi>natural</hi> or <hi>moral</hi> world. But alas!
<pb n="4" facs="unknown:004210_0006_1004225AA37BA9F8"/>
How ſoon do we read of the unhappy fruit of that fatal Revolt? <hi>Brother againſt Brother</hi>! proud and diſcon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tented <hi>Cain</hi> ſhedding the blood of <hi>righteous Abel!</hi> And how has this world been ever ſince, almoſt a Theatre of tragical Scenes, of <hi>Wars, Deſolations and Deſtructions,</hi> thro' the wickedneſs of them that dwell therein? And we have little reaſon to expect but that it will generally be ſo, 'till the glorious day, (which the Lord haſten!) when the <hi>Prince of peace,</hi> whoſe Sceptre is a <hi>Sceptre of Righteouſneſs,</hi> ſhall take unto Himſelf his great Power and Reign, and tread down his <hi>Enemies, who will not that He ſhould reign over them,</hi> and make the glorious Principles of his holy <hi>Religion</hi> ſo known and receiv'd, that the Kings and Judges of the Earth, ſhall <hi>kiſs the Son,</hi> and yield ſubjection unto Him; <hi>and they ſhall beat their Swords into plough-ſhares,</hi> and <hi>their Spears into pruning-hooks, nation ſhall not lift up Sword againſt nation, neither ſhall they learn war any more.</hi> According to that <hi>Prophecy, Iſa.</hi> 2.4.— But until this happy time comes on, and the <hi>Principles</hi> and Rules of the <hi>Goſpel</hi> are not yet ſo entertained, but that a Chriſtian State is expos'd to the <hi>Incurſions and Ravages</hi> of proud, am<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitious or covetous Men; it is needful, that they ſhou'd take care for their own <hi>Security</hi> and <hi>Defence.</hi> God can indeed, make thoſe who are diſpoſed to be their <hi>Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies, to be at peace with them.</hi> And it is the higheſt intereſt of any People to labour to be in good terms with the great Ruler and Governour of the world; and to <hi>put their truſt in Him,</hi> as their defence. Yet ſince, accord<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to the ordinary Courſe of Providence, his own Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple have ſeldom enjoyed <hi>laſting peace,</hi> but have been expos'd to Invaſions and Incroachments of unreaſonable Men, therefore it is needful and prudent for them to be upon their Guard and Defence, and be able to <hi>repel force by force.</hi> Otherwiſe their Civil and Sacred Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, their Lives and Properties, and all that is dear unto them, may be in the utmoſt hazard.

the <hi>principles,</hi> which the God who hath made us, hath implanted in us, it is plain that Chriſtians need Armour of Defence againſt their Enemies, that they may not be made a Prey unto Devourers.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Self-preſervation</hi> is a fundamental Law of humane Nature, and <hi>Chriſtianity</hi> does not overthrow any ſuch Laws but eſtabliſh them.— This is intimated to us, by that of <hi>our Lord</hi> to his Diſciples, <hi>Luk.</hi> 22.35, 36.—<hi>He ſaid unto them, when I ſent you without purſe and ſcrip and ſhoes, lacked ye any thing? and they ſaid nothing. Then ſaid He unto them, But now he that hath a purſe let him take it,— and he that hath no Sword let him ſell his Garment and buy one:</hi> Signifying, <q>that the Inſtruction which He gave them for the Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of their firſt Commiſſion, was but temporal, and for that time only obſervable, now the time requireth that you be armed to Encounter many Difficul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties"<note n="*" place="bottom">Engl.

And thus <hi>all
<pb n="6" facs="unknown:004210_0008_10042297C59394F0"/>
Chriſtians</hi> are to learn the <hi>ſame Leſſon.</hi> Men muſt have the Sword orderly put into their hands, before they may uſe it. It was not the Deſign of our Saviour to ſet up a <hi>Temporal Kingdom,</hi> or civil Dominion, as he ſaith, in another place, <hi>My Kingdom is not of this world, elſe would my Servants fight,</hi> (Joh. 18.36.) or they might reaſonably do it.</p>
            <p>The lawfulneſs of <hi>weapons of War,</hi> and the benefit of well appointed Arms, diſciplined and ſkilful Soldiers, has been well ſhew'd from this Deſk,—Let it ſuffice therefore, now to ſuggeſt,</p>
            <p>That the LORD himſelf hath this Title given Him as his great Honour: particularly in that <hi>Song of Tri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>umph</hi> after the miraculous Deſtruction of his People's <hi>Enemies, Exod.</hi> 15. <hi>Jehovah is a Man of War</hi>—.

            <p>The devout <hi>Pſalmiſt,</hi> who was alſo the valiant <hi>Leader of Iſrael,</hi> and by whoſe martial and brave Genius and Conduct, God <hi>ſubdued the Nations,</hi> the Enemies of his People, pays his acknowledgments to God, as the <hi>Giver</hi> of All his Dexterity and Skill, in handling his weapons of War, (Pſal. 44.1.) <hi>Bleſſed be the Lord my ſtrength, who teacheth my hands to war and my fingers to fight.</hi>— It is alſo recorded as part of his honorary Character, (2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 1.18.) That <hi>he bade them teach the Children of Iſrael the uſe of the Bow.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And long before, in the Story of <hi>Abraham,</hi> we find that he had more than Three Hundred Servants, <hi>Train'd Soldiers of his Houſe,</hi> expert and ready for the buſineſs, at an Hour's warning, (<hi>Gen.</hi> 14.14.) And what re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>markable Service did they, under his Skill and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct?</p>

            <p>Our <hi>holy Religion</hi> does not at all encourage People, in an <hi>idle and ſlothful</hi> dependence upon God, without the uſe of proper means.

            </p>
            <p n="1">1. As it refers to <hi>weapons of War,</hi> and the right uſe of them.</p>
            <p n="2">2. As it relates to the <hi>Chriſtian,</hi> or ſpiritual and divine Wiſdom.</p>
            <p n="1">1. To conſider it, as it relates to the uſe and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>provement of <hi>weapons of War</hi>; —or <hi>martial Wiſdom.</hi> For as there is the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> of the Handicrafts-Man in working in <hi>Gold and Silver, in Braſs, Weaving and Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broidery, Cutting and Setting of precious Stones, Carving of Timber,</hi> &amp;c. which God gave to <hi>Bezaleel</hi> and <hi>Abo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liab</hi>

And in <hi>waging War,</hi> there
<pb n="9" facs="unknown:004210_0011_100422D28DF78408"/>
is (as one obſerves) the greateſt Improvement of <hi>Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mane Wiſdom,</hi> Application and Induſtry.</p>
            <p>Whether <hi>this</hi> be the <hi>Wiſdom</hi> intended by <hi>Solomon</hi> in the Sentence before us, I will not diſpute; for whether it was by any ſubtle <hi>Stratagem of War,</hi> now ſeaſonably deviſed, or <hi>wiſe Treaty</hi> with this powerful King, that occaſion'd his <hi>Raiſing the Siege</hi>; or whether it was by his Piety, Faith and Prayers,—we are left at uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty.

            </p>
            <p>And as to this <hi>firſt,</hi> tho' a <hi>Lecture</hi> upon it might ſeem more natural from a <hi>Field-Officer,</hi> or Military Man, accompliſh'd to lay down the <hi>Rules of Prudence</hi> for himſelf and <hi>Fellow-Officers</hi> and <hi>Soldiers,</hi> and altho' this may be termed <hi>Humane Prudence,</hi> — yet it is not ſo aliene to the <hi>Sacred Oracles,</hi> as that a Miniſter of Chriſt ſhould be wholly a Stranger to it; ſeeing that the <hi>Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain of our Salvation,</hi> who has travelled in the <hi>greatneſs of his Strength,</hi> through a Field of Blood, who is now at the Head of his <hi>Church Militant,</hi> has been pleaſed to leave in his Word ſuch <hi>Inſtructions</hi> as are adapted to give Prudence and Wiſdom to Men in <hi>all Capacities</hi> and <hi>Conditions,</hi> not only to Men in the <hi>Sacred Order,</hi> but alſo <hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Military,</hi> from the <hi>King</hi> on the <hi>Throne</hi> to the <hi>loweſt Officer</hi> and <hi>Centinel</hi>; and it being the Duty of his <hi>Ambaſſadors,</hi> as they are call'd, to make application of particular Rules to Men in their <hi>ſeveral Capacities,</hi> and to endeavour to <hi>give to every one their portion, in Seaſon</hi>;— Therefore I hope the <hi>following hints</hi> will be well accepted on this Occaſion.</p>
            <p n="1">1. <hi>Martial Wiſdom</hi> will teach Men to fix upon <hi>right Ends</hi> in their <hi>Military Exerciſes and Enterprizes.</hi> Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers
<pb n="10" facs="unknown:004210_0012_100422DCCB288588"/>
muſt act as becomes reaſonable Beings, who are capable "to act for ſome End, and ſhould have that in their Eye as the meaſure of their Actions". And as of all other things, ſo of this, the ſupream End muſt be the <hi>Honour of God,</hi> and next to this, the <hi>Safety of the Commonwealth.</hi> The <hi>Good</hi> of warlike Weapons, is to be conſidered as <hi>relative</hi> to this, that a People may enjoy <hi>Peace and Safety.</hi> This is the End to be aimed at in all Martial Preparations. And when War is actually engaged in, or before it is undertaken, we find that God would have <hi>Peace firſt offered.—Deut.</hi> 20.10.</p>
            <p>It is bloody and barbarous Cruelty to aim at, and delight in <hi>butchering our Fellow-Men.</hi> The great De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign and Exerciſe of <hi>moral Prudence</hi> as it relates to <hi>Society,</hi> is that they may enjoy Peace and Safety, and ſo, as by the moſt <hi>natural Nurſe,</hi> Plenty, Civility and good Order, Arts and Religion may grow and flou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>riſh.—</p>
            <p>It is beneath the Character of Men of Martial Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to aim at meer <hi>Bravery</hi> and <hi>Show,</hi> or Pomp and Appearance, or to make only a Diverſion of their Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>erciſes,— but that they may be qualified to ſtand in a Day of Battle and War, and to ſpeak with the Enemy in the Gate. Therefore,</p>
            <p n="2">2. They muſt make it their Endeavour to be <hi>well furniſh'd with Military Science and Skill.</hi> Theſe are the firſt and neceſſary <hi>Leſſons</hi> of Martial Wiſdom, that they underſtand the Military <hi>Words of Command,</hi> their various <hi>Facings</hi> and <hi>Motions,</hi> that they commit no Errors or Blunders, and that they well and throughly underſtand the <hi>Exerciſe of their Arms,</hi> and are expert and ready in every <hi>Poſture,</hi> at the Word of the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mander.</p>
            <p>As this <hi>Order</hi> and ready <hi>Dexterity and Skill</hi> in an Army or particular Company, is a beautiful thing, ſo it will give a vaſt advantage to thoſe who attain and obſerve it, over thoſe who are but <hi>Adeptiſts</hi> in theſe
<pb n="11" facs="unknown:004210_0013_100422E4EDD1A510"/>
Things. It is the Encomium of the Soldiers of <hi>Zebulun,</hi> 1 Chron. 12.33. That <hi>they were expert in War, with all Inſtruments of War, who could keep Rank.</hi>— Skill in the Military Art is neceſſary in order to anſwer the main End propounded relating to a People, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out endeavouring after this, a <hi>Soldier</hi> doth not act as a Cauſe by Counſel, or becoming the powers of Reaſon. And how unſafe will they be, and all others who de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pend upon them, who when they come to uſe their <hi>Armour</hi> againſt the Enemy, they <hi>have not prov'd it,</hi> and ſcarce know their right Hand from their left. Martial Skill has not a little contributed to the Grandeur and Wealth of Nations. Numerous <hi>Armies</hi> have been put to the rout by a few <hi>well-diſciplin'd</hi> Troops. Here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by <hi>Alexander</hi> puſh'd on his Conqueſts to ſuch pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>digious Succeſs: and hereby the <hi>Romans</hi> gain'd ſuch <hi>univerſal Empire.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="3">3. Another part of <hi>Martial Wiſdom</hi> lies in the <hi>Choice of the fitteſt weapons or warlike preparations, for the ſeveral Ends or Purpoſes in view.</hi> It is well underſtood that different warlike Preparations are requir'd to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage an Enemy at <hi>Sea,</hi> from thoſe by <hi>Land</hi>; and that ſuch <hi>Batteries</hi> or <hi>Bulwarks</hi> as may be a Defence againſt <hi>Small Arms,</hi> will not be ſo againſt <hi>Cannon.</hi> And that ſuch, may be prepar'd and accompliſh'd Men, to en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gage with an Enemy in an <hi>open and well-formed Camp,</hi> who are not fit to follow an Enemy in the <hi>Thickets</hi> and Lurking places of a howling <hi>Wilderneſs.</hi>— We read ſometimes of <hi>choſen Men of Iſrael.</hi> Every one is not fit to be a Soldier. Men ſhould be ſelected and choſen according to the ſeveral Services to which they are de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign'd; And their Martial Weapons, Proviſions and Preparations ſhould be accordingly. In this, <hi>Wiſdom is profitable to direct.</hi> It was the great Strength and Prudence of the <hi>Ruebenites</hi> and <hi>Gadites</hi> that they were furniſh'd with <hi>all manner of Inſtruments of War for the Battle.</hi> (1 Chron. 12.37.)</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="12" facs="unknown:004210_0014_100422E9F6E8B788"/>Soldiers in general, ſhould be able to <hi>endure hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</hi> (2 Tim. 2.3.) But ſome are much more capable to endure Hunger and Thirſt, and Travel and Cold, and lying in the Deſerts than others. As a <hi>Scythian</hi> Commander ſaid to <hi>Philip</hi> of <hi>Macedon,</hi> 
               <q>You com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand <hi>Macedonians</hi> that can fight with Men, but I command <hi>Scythians</hi> who can ſight with Hunger and Thirſt.</q> There are but few like the Soldiers of <hi>Guſtavus Adolphus,</hi> the brave King of <hi>Sweden,</hi> of whom the ingenious <hi>Fuller</hi> ſaith, <hi>They had moſt life in the dead of Winter.</hi>— Some ſuch we have had, and may need more.</p>
            <p>It was certainly Prudence in <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> however he fail'd in his <hi>Policy,</hi> in hearkening to his <hi>young Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſellors,</hi> that afterwards he made him <hi>fenced Cities,</hi> and put therein Proviſions, Officers and warlike Stores,—as 2 Chron. 11.5,—12. See alſo what is recorded, as an inſtance of the Wiſdom of pious King <hi>Hezekiah,</hi> on a threatning <hi>Invaſion,</hi> 2 Chron. 32.2,—6.</p>
            <p n="4">4. —In placing <hi>the greateſt Truſt in Men of the beſt Prudence, Diſcretion and Courage.</hi> This refers eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially to the Care of <hi>Superiour Rulers,</hi> whoſe buſineſs it is to put their Sons into places of <hi>Truſt</hi> and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand.— But then as to the Perſons themſelves be-truſted in any <hi>Military Poſt,</hi> they will ſurely think it their Wiſdom and Honour, to underſtand well and obſerve the Duties of their Station, and every one <hi>do their own Buſineſs.</hi>— One <hi>wiſe Commander</hi> may be better than many <hi>fighting</hi> Men.</p>
            <p>King <hi>Saul</hi> ſtrengthned himſelf in his War againſt the Philiſtines, as it is ſaid of him, (1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 14.52.) <hi>That when he ſaw any ſtrong or valiant Man, he took him to himſelf.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It was <hi>David</hi>'s Wiſdom to confer the chief Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand on <hi>Joab,</hi> who was a Man of ſuch ſingular Courage and Valour. And as it was his great Honour to up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold and greatly to promote and encourage the <hi>Worſhip
<pb n="13" facs="unknown:004210_0015_100422F0D26DC600"/>
of God</hi>; ſo it was not a little owing (under God) to his Prudence in ſeeking out and beſtowing Places of Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand on Men of great Spirits and <hi>Martial Proweſs,</hi> that he had ſuch Victories and Succeſſes; that the Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions round about were brought into a State of <hi>Subjection</hi> or <hi>Tribute</hi> or <hi>Alliance</hi>; that in the Days of his Son and immediate Succeſſor, there was <hi>no Adverſary nor evil occurrent.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="5">5. —In <hi>obſerving the beſt Seaſons for any Enterprizes or Treaties.</hi> This requires a good degree of natural Sagacity, together with Prudence gain'd by Obſerva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion and Experience; to avoid <hi>Raſhneſs</hi> and Precipi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tancy on the one hand, and <hi>Dilatorineſs</hi> and Sluggiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs on the other. Succeſs has often depended on the actual <hi>timing</hi> of Engagements or Treaties; or vigilant Improvement of the Tempers, Diſpoſitions and Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ners of Enemies. Through neglect or want of Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>licy or Counſel great advantage may be given to the Enemy, and the benefit of former Victories may be loſt: <q>as <hi>Hannibal, Attilius-Regulus,</hi> and other ſtout Warriours have done.</q> Hence it has been a trite Saying, <hi>In bello nihil eſt mininum negligendum.</hi> We muſt beware of the leaſt Error in War. <hi>(In bello non-licit bis peccare.)</hi> It is ſaid of the <hi>Romans,</hi> that they conquered more by their <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> than by their En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terprizes.</p>
            <p n="6">6. —In the <hi>good Government of Commanders, and the ſtrict ſubjection of Soldiers unto them.</hi> It is highly ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary that Officers and Soldiers be <hi>Loyal</hi> to their <hi>King,</hi> true and faithful to their <hi>Country.</hi> It is the Duty of Chriſtians in common, to <hi>ſubmit to the King as Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pream, and unto Governours as thoſe that are ſent by him.</hi> (1 Pet. 2.13, 14.) and it is peculiarly expected of Men under a Military Conſideration, as they receive their ſeveral Poſts, <hi>Commiſſions</hi> and Orders from them.</p>
            <p>Order is the <hi>Beauty</hi> of the <hi>Univerſe,</hi> the Strength and Glory of all <hi>Societies.</hi> And this in an <hi>Army</hi> or any
<pb n="14" facs="unknown:004210_0016_100422F961AAE968"/>
Military Company, conſiſts, <hi>in every one's obſerving the Duties of their reſpective places.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>It highly concerns <hi>Officers</hi> to conſider this, that Sol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diers in their State of Diſcipline may be trained up and prepared for Service, by a ready Obedience, that they may not upon Emergencies and Dangers run out of their <hi>Line,</hi> Mutiny and Deſert, to the Shame of thoſe that lead them, and Ruin of the People that truſt in them.— <hi>This,</hi> I apprehend to be one great end of the <hi>Training Days,</hi> that Soldiers may be taught <hi>good Order</hi> and ready Obedience to their Commanders and in their ſeveral Places; and this is exceeding ſervicea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble and neceſſary. It muſt needs be lookt upon as the Wiſdom of a <hi>State</hi> to enact good <hi>Laws</hi> for the uphold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of <hi>Martial Government</hi> and Order, and ſevere Penalties in caſe of <hi>Diſobedience,</hi> or according as the Crimes may deſerve:— Yet it is greatly to be de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſired and is the moſt certain expedient that <hi>Officers</hi> by their Wiſdom, Courage, Integrity, Clemency and ſhin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Examples do gain and command their Hearts. It is the Character of a good Officer, 'that he <hi>loves</hi> and is beloved by his Soldiers';— and of a good Soldier, that it is his Care to <hi>pleaſe him who has choſen him to be a Soldier.</hi> (2 Tim. 2.4.) It is the great Commendation both of the <hi>Centurion</hi> and of his Soldiers, (Mat. 8.9.) <hi>I alſo am a Man under Authority, and I ſay unto one go, and he goeth, and to another come, and he cometh; and to my Servant do this, and he doeth it.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>How lovely and beautiful is <hi>Order</hi> in all Societies? The lovers of it, are pleas'd to ſee it in the <hi>Artillery Exerciſes.</hi> And moſt ſtrictly it ſhould be obſerv'd in real Engagements. Every one muſt <hi>keep Rank,</hi> do the Duty and keep the Place aſſign'd him. Perſonal Danger will not excuſe the breach of Order, other<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wiſe their Weapons may be pointed to one another's Deſtruction.</p>
            <p>
               <pb n="15" facs="unknown:004210_0017_100422FDACF5DF58"/>It is a ſad <hi>Omen</hi> to a <hi>Country,</hi> to the <hi>Military</hi> and <hi>Civil</hi> Concerns of it, when an <hi>ungovernable mutinous</hi> Spirit prevails. Such a Spirit in an <hi>Army</hi> threatens the utmoſt <hi>Confuſion and Ruin</hi>; and it is not much leſs dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous in the <hi>State.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="7">7. Martial Wiſdom conſiſts not a little, <hi>in avoiding ſuch things as will diſqualify and unfit Men for the Buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to which they are deſigned.</hi> Whatſoever tends to unfit a Commander or Soldier for real Service, and ſo to fruſtrate the good end which they ſhould aim at, Prudence obliges them to avoid. As,</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Idleneſs and Sloth,</hi> Careleſſneſs and Inactivity. A Military Life requires Spirit and Action. The dull unactive Perſon is very unlikely to be prepar'd for Service, and ſuch as have a Spirit of <hi>Indifferency</hi> and <hi>care for none of theſe things.

            <p>Tho' Men ſhould not expoſe themſelves to needleſs Dangers; this is not a wiſe Bravery; nor throw away Life where the Caſe is plainly <hi>deſperate:</hi> But <hi>Magnani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mity and Fortitude</hi> is an excellent Qualification of the <hi>Men of Arms,</hi> as fitting them for great Attempts, and preparing the Mind to bear up againſt Hardſhips and Difficulties, and to hazard their <hi>Lives</hi> in the Cauſe of God and his People. What a brave and animating Expreſſion was that, and how becoming a <hi>General</hi> of <hi>Iſrael?</hi> (2 Sam. 10.12.) <hi>Be of good Courage, and let us play the Men for our People, and for the Cities of our God; and the Lord do what ſeemeth him good!</hi>

The leaſt ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearances that way are therefore generally animadver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted on, by <hi>wiſe</hi> and obſerving Commanders, as a thing of dangerous Conſequence.

            <p>A <hi>Houſe</hi> or <hi>Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf cannot ſtand.</hi> This is our Saviour's wiſe Aphoriſm, (Mark 3.34.) and we find, that the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> when he pray'd for the <hi>Deſtruction</hi> of his Enemies, deſires their <hi>Diſſention</hi> as the ready means of it, Pſal. 55.9. <hi>Deſtroy O Lord, divide their Tongues.

            <p>Now when theſe <hi>ſeveral parts</hi> of <hi>Martial Wiſdom</hi> are conſidered, will it not be readily acknowledged, that this Wiſdom hath the preference to <hi>weapons of War</hi> themſelves?— For to what purpoſe are <hi>they,</hi>

if not under a good <hi>Direction?</hi>— Yea they are evil and miſchievous, if the <hi>End</hi> to which they are improved be evil and unrighteous, ſinful and unwarrantable. Or if they are taken up on a good Deſign, and with lauda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble Views, if they are not <hi>underſtood and ſkilfully han<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dled,</hi> of how little benefit?—or if Martial Men and Arms are not <hi>wiſely choſen</hi> and adapted to <hi>particular Occaſions</hi> and Emergencies, or according to the Quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties and Circumſtances of the Enemies engaged againſt? —or if <hi>Martial Government, Diſcipline and Order</hi> be not prudently aſſerted and maintained, or but little regarded by thoſe under Authority, is there any thing great or good likely to be effected? If Arms are not ſupported by <hi>Juſtice and Right,</hi> if they are not purſued with <hi>Sedateneſs, Courage and Magnanimity,</hi> certainly Diſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointment, <hi>Loſſes and Sorrows</hi> are to be expected, in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtead of <hi>Victory and Succeſs.</hi> And ſo, if ſuch <hi>Vices</hi> are indulged in <hi>Men of that Order,</hi> as not only fully their Character, but have a natural tendency to weaken their Hands and Hearts.</p>
            <p>Or if <hi>Diſcord and Mutiny, Falſhood and Treachery</hi> ſhould ariſe, inſtead of the happy <hi>Bonds of Love,</hi> bro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>therly Agreement and Harmony, how will Arms ever ſo ſtrong and well-appointed, be rendred fruitleſs and inſignificant? <hi>Parva ſunt foris Arma, niſi eſt Concilium Domi.</hi> Cicero.</p>
            <p n="2">2. I am to conſider the preference and excellency of <hi>Wiſdom,</hi> under a <hi>religious or divine Character.</hi> Here I may not diſcourſe as the Subject would admit, but briefly.</p>
            <p>This <hi>Wiſdom</hi> conſiſts in the Knowledge of God in <hi>Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> or as he hath revealed himſelf to us in the <hi>Goſpe</hi>; in ſuch a Knowledge of his Will and his glorious and <hi>attractive Excellencies</hi> as prevails on the Will, and accordingly governs the <hi>choice and affections</hi> of the Soul. Such as have this Wiſdom tho' they have the moſt valuable Knowledge, yet they have not always the

largeſt <hi>natural Underſtanding,</hi> nor the greateſt <hi>Stock of Ideas</hi> treaſur'd up in their Minds. They may be very deſtitute of civil Policy, and be deficient in many points of humane Prudence. But they have ſuch apprehenſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Divine Perfections, of the <hi>Glory of God in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> as that they unfeignedly em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brace Him as their Portion and <hi>everlaſting Happineſs.</hi> They <hi>devote</hi> themſelves to Him, and make it their prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal Care to obey and pleaſe Him, as moſt worthy of the higheſt Honour from all the principles of <hi>Juſtice, Love and Gratitude.</hi> And it is their prevailing Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cern and Deſire, as their higheſt good, that they may have ſuch a clear Knowledge of God as ſhall perfect their Natures and make them conformable to his moral Excellencies, that they may be for ever with Chriſt and behold his Glory!</p>
            <p>This is the beginning of Wiſdom, (the <hi>chiefeſt Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi>) when Men know and fear God and give <hi>Glory unto Him.</hi> This Knowledge of the <hi>Holy is their Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding.</hi> This is the Wiſdom of the higheſt <hi>Intelligen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cies,</hi> and this is their Glory;— the Glory of the higheſt <hi>Seraphs,</hi> that they know and reverence and love the moſt perfect Being, the Author of their Beings, and of <hi>all Good.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>This is the ſuperiour Wiſdom and Excellency of Man, in every Character and Station, and gives the precedency to them that have it. It gives <hi>an Ornament of Grace to their Head, and a Crown of Glory doth it deliver them.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But here I ſhall a little apply it to Men as under a <hi>Military Character,</hi> and ſhew the <hi>Advantages</hi> of it to <hi>them:</hi> For the Buſineſs and Life of a <hi>Soldier</hi> ſhould not be thought inconſiſtent with <hi>this Wiſdom,</hi> no more than any other lawful Employment and Buſineſs of Life. The <hi>better Chriſtians</hi> Men are, or the more they are acquainted and enrich'd with this divine Wiſdom (other things being equal) the better they are in every <hi>Calling</hi>

and Employment of Life: the better <hi>furniſhed</hi> to a due deportment in all <hi>Capacities, Relations and Conditions.</hi> And particularly, it is the beſt Qualification and the greateſt Honour of Men in <hi>Military Life.</hi> "They are the only fit Men to be Commanders who have learnt to obey their God.</p>
            <p>This Wiſdom will <hi>direct</hi> and fix their <hi>Views</hi>; that the ſupream <hi>End</hi> of their Preparations and Military Labours and Atchievements, be what ought to be the Chriſtians governing Deſign in all the weighty Concerns of Life, the Glory of God, and the <hi>good of their Fellow-Chriſtians,</hi> as concerned herein; the Defence and Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity of their Religion, Liberties and Eſtates.—In <hi>the Name of the Lord they will ſet up their Banners.</hi> (Pſal. 20.5.) This Wiſdom gives them the beſt Rules of their Actions, and will guard them againſt all <hi>Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities and Vices,</hi> innumerable <hi>Miſchiefs and Dangers.</hi> This will direct their dependence, where they may <hi>truſt and not be afraid</hi>: even in the <hi>Lord of Hoſts, the God of Armies.</hi> While ſome truſt in Horſes and ſome in Chariots, they will remember the Name of the Lord their God.—Thus they are led to the <hi>Captain of our Salvation,</hi> whoſe Name is, <hi>King of Kings, and Lord of Lords.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>What Courage, Fortitude and preſence of Mind will this give his <hi>Followers,</hi> his <hi>Soldiers,</hi> when engag'd in his Cauſe, and aſſur'd of his Preſence, who <hi>alone</hi> can win the Field in the deſpite of all Oppoſition? or who can ſave by few as well as by many; who can <hi>make one chaſe a thouſand, and two put ten thouſand to flight,</hi> as in the Inſtance of <hi>Jonathan</hi> and his <hi>Armour-bearer.</hi>

            </p>
            <p>Our <hi>Captain General,</hi> who is at the Head of our <hi>Militia,</hi> under our rightful Sovereign King GEORGE, from his natural and paternal Concern for the <hi>Land of his Nativity,</hi> hath ſeveral Times recommended the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pairing and ſtrengthning the <hi>Forts and Garriſons</hi> of this Province. But how little hath been done, except of late in our principal Fortreſs?— We truſt it is His <hi>Excellency</hi>'s Care, from ſuch a Spirit and Principle, to put the chief commanding <hi>Offices</hi> into the Hands of ſuch as may fill and adorn their Station, as well as to recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mend it to the <hi>Field-Officers</hi> (as I am well informed) to fill up the <hi>Poſts</hi> under their Care, with known <hi>vertuous, ſober, accompliſh'd</hi> Men.— Such will have it to anſwer for, who may recommend Men out of private Intereſt, Favour or Affection, without a due regard to <hi>good Qualifications.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Now to apply this Inference to Men of the <hi>Military-Order.</hi>— It is much to be deſired that the <hi>ſeveral Officers,</hi> according to the Truſt repos'd in them, would labour to excel in <hi>Martial Accompliſhments,</hi> and lay out themſelves to <hi>communicate</hi> them to thoſe under their

Care and Command, and to uphold good Order and Government, and to be exemplarily ſober and vertuous, and as much as poſſible reſtrain and prevent all manner of Vices and Exorbitancies.</p>
            <p>And may the <hi>Soldiers</hi> yield a <hi>ready Obedience</hi> and have a laudable Ambition to be furniſhed with ſuch Skill and Diſcretion as may render them <hi>ſervicable,</hi> if <gap reason="illegible: indecipherable" extent="3 letters">

            </p>
            <p>It is an unhappy <hi>Diſadvantage</hi> to a People, when Men a little above the ordinary Rank, as to Breeding or Eſtates, are diſpoſed to <hi>flight</hi> the Military Skill and Exerciſes, when it becomes an <hi>unfaſhionable Thing</hi> to give their attendance on ſuch Occaſions; as if it were a diſhonour to them to appear in the <hi>Field,</hi> or it were their Intereſt to pay their <hi>ſmall Fines.</hi>— How may an <hi>expos'd Country,</hi> by the prevailing of <hi>this Temper,</hi> be depriv'd of the Service of ſome of the beſt natural Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity and Strength, when its greateſt Exigencies call for them?</p>
            <p>Indeed when <hi>Martial Weapons</hi> are neglected, it is an Evidence that a People are growing very ſecure, or <hi>mean and low ſpirited,</hi> ſervile and readily ſubject to thoſe who may be diſpos'd to invade or inſult them: As it was with <hi>Iſrael,</hi> when they had <hi>forſaken the Lord</hi> and <hi>ſerved other Gods.</hi> Among Forty Thouſand of them there was not a <hi>Shield or Spear</hi> to be ſeen, 'till a <hi>Woman</hi> roſe and judged them. <hi>(Judg.</hi> 5.8.)</p>
            <p>Such then are to be commended and honoured, who from a generous Deſire to ſerve the beſt <hi>Intereſts</hi> of their <hi>Country,</hi> apply themſelves to attain <hi>Martial Skill

            <p>It is therefore to be deſired that this Spirit were cheriſh'd, and more appearing and acting in this <hi>leading Town,</hi> and ſo in <hi>all parts</hi> of the Land, that it may be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come <hi>faſhionable and reputable.</hi> Ill Examples have prevail'd to give a ſort of Reputation to ſome <hi>Evil Practices.</hi> It is pity that Vertue and ſome <hi>uſeful and laudable Exerciſes and Accompliſhments,</hi> ſhould not find as many <hi>Patrons,</hi> and of all <hi>Ranks</hi> of Men to encou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rage them.</p>
            <p>Now to apply my ſelf to the Gentlemen of the Honourable Artillery Company in this place.</p>
            <p>It is at your Requeſt, Gentlemen, that I ſtand in this <hi>Deſk</hi> at this Time, however unequal to the Service ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected from me. As I have (I truſt) an honeſt intention to ſerve you, both in your Military and Chriſtian Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pacity, I hope for your Candour and good Reception of what I have offered.— Your Calling you ſee, is warranted from the Word of God, and what are the generous and pious <hi>Views</hi> that muſt act and govern you in your <hi>Martial Exerciſes,</hi> that you may be accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliſh'd to ſerve God and your Country, if call'd there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>unto in the hazardous Enterprizes of <hi>War.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I take it to be a part of the good Deſign of this <hi>Honourable Company,</hi> to ſet a good Example by their attendance on theſe Exerciſes, as not unworthy of Men of <hi>Eſtates or Character and Education,</hi> with this noble and generous View that they may be better capacitated to ſerve in the Defence of their Country, their Liber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties, Eſtates, Lives, Religion, and all that is dear to them.— May this Honourable Company prove a happy and growing <hi>Seminary</hi> of good Soldiers, not only of this <hi>Town,</hi> but from all parts of this Land, and
<pb n="29" facs="unknown:004210_0031_100423A6C1847550"/>
by their Example revive the Military Skill and Ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nius.— When you conſider your <hi>ancient Charter</hi> (now entring, I think, into the <hi>Hundredth Year)</hi> and the prudent Deſign of our Forefathers, you will by a conſcionable attendance on all proper means endeavour to be furniſh'd with Military <hi>Skill and Wiſdom,</hi> and excel therein.</p>
            <p>It is Underſtanding and Wiſdom that gives Man advantage over the Bruits, otherwiſe he would ſoon looſe his Dominion. And <hi>Wiſdom</hi> according to the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of it gives Men advantage one over another, and particularly in <hi>Military</hi> Enterprizes.</p>
            <p>And you will always remember that you are <hi>Chriſtian Soldiers,</hi> and that not only the Principles of State-Policy and moral Prudence muſt be conſulted, but eſpecially the grand Principles of Chriſtian Wiſdom. <hi>Moral Prudence</hi> is always reckon'd among the <hi>Cardinal Ver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tues</hi>; but Chriſtian Wiſdom is the firſt excellency and ſhining Glory of a Man in every Capacity and Station. This will be profitable to direct you.— You are ſenſible who is the Source and Fountain of all Wiſdom, and that you need <hi>Direction</hi> from the <hi>Sacred Scriptures,</hi> which are deſign'd to make Men wiſe. Your Senſe of theſe Things is the Reaſon, we conclude, why you deſire your <hi>Anniverſary</hi> moſt publick Appearence, ſhould be thus attended, that it may be <hi>ſanctified by the Word of God and Prayer,</hi>— that you may be more furniſh'd and diſpos'd to approve your ſelves Chriſtian Soldiers. And <hi>if this Wiſdom enter into your Heart, and is pleaſant to your Soul,—Diſcretion ſhall preſerve you, Underſtanding ſhall keep you,</hi> (Prov. 2.10, 11.)—This will be on all Occaſions, your Strength and Safety, your <hi>Ornament and Glory.</hi>—To ſee a Soldier clad in his <hi>goodly Attire</hi> and rich Habiliments, attracts the Eyes, and pleaſes the Imagination of Spectators. But ſurely this Wiſdom is the <hi>goodlier Ornament,</hi> this is the Righteouſneſs of the Saints. The Soldiers that <hi>follow
<pb n="30" facs="unknown:004210_0032_100421E46E6B6088"/>
the Lamb</hi> ſhould be cloath'd with this fine Linnen white and clean. Thus they will be alſo furniſh'd from the Divine <hi>Armoury,</hi> for <hi>every Grace</hi> attends this Heavenly Wiſdom. This is indeed a <hi>lovely Sight!</hi> The <hi>Holy Angels</hi> will be pleas'd to behold ſuch, and will be <hi>miniſtring Spirits</hi> to ſuch here on Earth, and gladly guard their <hi>Heaven-born Souls</hi> whether departing in War or Peace, and convey them through the <hi>Regions of the Prince of Darkneſs,</hi> unhurt, untouch'd: and will make you their Companions amongſt the bright and <hi>Heavenly Hoſts.</hi> And you ſhall come again with them in the <hi>Great Day,</hi> (which the <hi>Church-Triumphant</hi> as well as <hi>Militant</hi> waits for!) the Day of that <hi>Grand Maſter</hi> of all the <hi>Coeleſtial Armies,</hi> when the flaming <hi>Chariots</hi> of the Great King will be <hi>Ten Thouſand times Ten Thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſand.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O who will not wiſh themſelves of that Glorious Army, under the Conduct and Protection of <hi>the Captain</hi> of our Salvation? when the <hi>Arch-Angel</hi> ſhall ſound the Alarm to all the World, and his mighty Voice ſhall be heard in the <hi>ſilent Tombs</hi> and in the great <hi>Deeps,</hi> and the <hi>Dead</hi> ſhall come forth, the glorious <hi>Army of Mar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tyrs,</hi> and all that in Faith have laid down their Lives in the Cauſe of Chriſt, and who have <hi>reſiſted unto Blood, ſtriving againſt Sin.</hi> And they ſhall be gloriouſly <hi>ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rayed,</hi>—there they ſhall receive the (<hi>Corona triumphalis)</hi> the <hi>Crown of Glory,</hi> which the Righteous Judge hath laid up, not for that <hi>Chriſtian Hero</hi> only, the great Apoſtle <hi>Paul,</hi> but for <hi>all who have fought the good Fight, and finiſhed</hi> well <hi>their Courſe.</hi> (2 Tim. 4.7, 8.) It is ſurely the beſt Wiſdom to make this your Choice, and to take the Courſe that leads to this Felicity.</p>
            <p>To Conclude, This is what concerns us all as <hi>Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ans,</hi> who are, in the <hi>Sacred Oracles,</hi> frequently conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der'd as <hi>Soldiers,</hi> who have our ſpiritual warfare to accompliſh. There we are directed to <hi>put on the Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mour of Light,</hi> (Rom. 13.12.) i. e. to be well fur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh'd
<pb n="31" facs="unknown:004210_0033_100423AB98690600"/>
with the beſt of Knowledge and ſpiritual Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom. This will be our <hi>Defence</hi> againſt <hi>Sin and Tempta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> as it will ſhew us the evil and miſchief of Sin, the excellency and benefit of Obedience. This will help us to regulate our <hi>diſorderly Paſſions,</hi> to ſubdue our <hi>Luſts</hi> and <hi>walk circumſpectly (exactly)</hi> in every Relation and Condition; as it leads us to the ſpiritual <hi>Armoury,</hi> the <hi>Word of God,</hi> and eſpecially as it leads us to <hi>Chriſt,</hi> and to derive Strength from Him who is <hi>ſtronger than the ſtrong Man armed,</hi> and who has <hi>overcome the World,</hi> and bid us therefore <hi>not to fear.</hi> This will teach us to ſet his Example before us, and to keep in our View the <hi>ſtrongeſt Motives</hi> and Arguments to all Duty,— the <hi>Glory</hi> and Honour of Him under whoſe <hi>Banner we are enliſted,</hi> and the <hi>bliſsful Rewards</hi> of perfect Knowledge and Holineſs, and the <hi>fulneſs of Joys which are in his Preſence for ever.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>O let us then labour earneſtly after this Wiſdom, <hi>humbly ſeeking</hi> to the bleſſed Author of it in the diligent improvement of <hi>all appointed Means,</hi> and grow and <hi>increaſe therein</hi>; we may then expect the gracious Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>duct of the Glorious <hi>Head of the Church,</hi> the <hi>Leader and Commander of his People,</hi> and that we ſhall be car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried through the Difficulties of our preſent warfare, and be <hi>more than Conquerers through Him who hath loved us,</hi>—and may depend upon that great and ſurprizing <hi>Promiſe</hi> of his, <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.21. <hi>To him that overcometh will I grant to ſit down with me on my Throne, even as I alſo overcame, and am ſet down with my Father on his Throne.</hi> Amen.</p>
